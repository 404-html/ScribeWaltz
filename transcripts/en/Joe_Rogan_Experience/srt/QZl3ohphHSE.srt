1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,290
The Joe Rogan experience,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,340
Right?
We're live.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,160
We can't hear ourselves because Brian 
Cox,

4
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:22,230
even though he's a musician,
he goes,

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:25,650
no headphone where we can still hear us.
I can hear you.

6
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,090
You're right.
I just can't hear whether or not,

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,230
but we wouldn't know.
Anyway.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,420
What would we do?
He knows he's got headphones on.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,150
You're right.
This is revolutionary from now on.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,010
No more headphones.
It's ridiculous.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,130
What would you use them for?
Well,

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,240
it's like watching television while 
you're on television.

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,790
It's like if you were on TV and you were
watching a video monitor,

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,440
it seems weird.
Yeah,

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,990
it's a little redundant.
I think we should leave.

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,140
Cast them aside.
Yeah,

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,820
let's just a revolutionary act.
Push them.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,730
Push them away.
Like not just put them down.

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,100
Push them away.
We reject you.

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,420
Oh,
headphones.

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,640
We reject you.
Amazing technology.

22
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,920
Infinite monkey cage.
Yeah.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,790
What's going on,
man?

24
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,210
What is this?

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,470
First of all,
I'm a huge fan of your work.

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,570
I said that when he came in,
but I have to tell people online.

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,790
This is a huge treat for me.
I'm very excited.

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,330
Space has been my all time adult freak 
out.

29
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:15,450
Pleasure.
I love watching space documentaries.

30
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,940
I love watching television shows on 
space.

31
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:20,460
So having you in here is a huge treat.
Thank you.

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,260
What's infinite monkey cage?
It's a long running now,

33
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,340
a BBC radio show.
So the idea initially was to get 

34
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,590
scientists to talk about their science,
whatever it may be.

35
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,570
You said cosmology or archeology?
Human origins,

36
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,040
mathematics,
everything.

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,240
And then I do it with a standup comedian
called Robin Inns.

38
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,290
It's very good friend of mine and we 
always also invite another guest who 

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,391
will be a comedian sometimes or an actor
or someone who will kind of ask those 

40
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:52,670
questions that come in from left field 
and.

41
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,530
But it always goes off into some as as 
your podcast do it just,

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,240
you never know where it's going to go.
So we're gonna call it a front of a live

43
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:05,241
audience,
usually London and we record for about 

44
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,210
two hours,
usually in broadcast every about 30 

45
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,210
minutes and as a podcast as well,
which is a bit longer,

46
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,770
but we decided to bring it to the states
because there are lots of scientists in 

47
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,031
the states,
lots of comedians and people like 

48
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:19,101
yourself that you're going to do it with
us in three weeks in their wealth of 

49
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:22,610
Thursday,
the twelfth in La and so we just want 

50
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,071
it.
So we're going to record them for the 

51
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:26,250
BBC and they're going to be on the 
podcast and broadcast in the UK but also

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,780
in front of a live audience.
So it's a.

53
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,370
someone asked me this morning actually,
and I said,

54
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,940
it's kind of like a variety show that 
you had an accent.

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,450
Do you have those in the states?
They said yeah,

56
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:38,451
we used to have them.
We used to happen the and used to do 

57
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:38,451
one.
So I said,

58
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,180
well it's kind of like Dave Dimartino 
had a phd and he would have.

59
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,290
It would have been that black and white,
a bit of singing and dancing,

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,560
bit of quantum mechanics basically.
That's one of the things that's so 

61
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,621
important about what you do,
what Neil degrasse Tyson does is that 

62
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:51,870
you guys,
you,

63
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,871
you,
you were entertaining as well as having 

64
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:58,350
a genuine passion and a deep knowledge 
of science.

65
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:02,170
So it's not just like here's the cold 
hard facts,

66
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,180
which are amazing and fascinating on 
their own,

67
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,450
but you guys both have this way of sort 
of germinating these ideas into people's

68
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,790
minds that might not ordinarily accept 
them because,

69
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,320
uh,
there's a lot of people in America 

70
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,600
especially that associate learning with 
boring.

71
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,190
Well,
I think the,

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,360
the important point series point science
is too important not to be part of 

73
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:29,020
popular culture.
So if we.

74
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,350
Popular Culture is the thing that people
discuss.

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,000
So if we seed that to talent shows or 
sports or whatever it is,

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,300
then we're removing the most important 
area of human endeavor out of general 

77
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,660
conversation.
So I think there's a very,

78
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,660
there's a responsibility on scientists 
to say,

79
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,830
well,
I accept that.

80
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,710
Of course,
I can't talk at the level that I let you

81
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,310
out at a as an undergraduate lecture 
course at university or even a Postgrad,

82
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:59,311
electrical,
so the level of my thesis and my 

83
00:03:59,311 --> 00:03:59,311
research,
I can't do that,

84
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:01,630
but it's extremely important that we 
don't just see all the ground.

85
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,690
We don't want people in in bars tonight 
or wherever in restaurants to only talk 

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,630
to be talking about the grammys last 
night.

87
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,700
We like them to be talking about the 
fact that the universe may be infinite 

88
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,991
in extent that asking questions such as 
how many civilizations other in the 

89
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,560
Milky Way Galaxy,
the question,

90
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,660
the answer might be not very many.

91
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,870
If that's true,
then what does that mean for the way 

92
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:27,870
that we behave?
These are important questions,

93
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,280
but they will never be debated it unless
we take the time and and make the effort

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,480
to to,
to make the science and the ideas and 

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,480
the debate around them.
Part of popular culture,

96
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,620
the Internet has also opened up a lot of
people's ideas about what science can be

97
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:50,101
and also it opened up a lot of people's 
ideas about the actual popularity of 

98
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,400
science because there's,
until,

99
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,180
you know,
maybe 10,

100
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:57,181
20 years ago with the notable exception 
of like maybe Carl Sagan and a few other

101
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,940
famous people that became famous for,
you know,

102
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,460
uh,
either cosmologists are mathematicians.

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,980
It's very,
very rare.

104
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,020
But now you're seeing guys like 
yourself,

105
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,320
guys like Neil degrasse Tyson.
It's like more and more Richard Dawkins,

106
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,760
Christopher Hitchens,
while he's alive,

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,650
these interesting intellectuals become 
much more mainstream.

108
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,860
They become a.
because people realized it wasn't that 

109
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,440
folks weren't interested in these 
subjects before it was this.

110
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,230
They really weren't being presented 
them.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,440
If you don't get enough ratings,
if you put your show on Thursday night 

112
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,500
at 8:00
PM and you don't get x amount of number 

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,840
of people watching,
the studio loses interest.

114
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:37,780
The people that produce it start looking
at other jobs.

115
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:38,100
I,
well,

116
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:40,210
this one wasn't going to work and they 
start moving on.

117
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,400
And that's just the reality of 
television.

118
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,320
And I think that with the Internet,
people are able to look at some of these

119
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,940
subjects and,
and you know,

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,820
someone will send out a tweet or a 
facebook link or something like that,

121
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:52,630
and then you'll say,
well,

122
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:55,930
this got a million people to look at it 
over the last 12 weeks.

123
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,160
And the,
this has

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
sort of,
instead of having this immediate 

125
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,530
timeframe where everybody has to pay 
attention or the show dies,

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,030
now ideas are allowed to sort of grow.
Yeah,

127
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,050
I think you're absolutely right about 
that.

128
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,130
I think we as a culture underestimate 
people.

129
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,190
I think this is what you found with your
podcast.

130
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:21,191
I think that there are millions of 
people out there who are interested in 

131
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:24,761
ideas interested in the latest things we
found out about the universe and nature 

132
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,170
and the way that it works.
Um,

133
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,240
and they'll,
they'll come to it.

134
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,740
You can,
you build an audience,

135
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:35,741
I suppose,
and it's very important for the reasons 

136
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:36,440
that I outlined our civilization,
Carl Sagan,

137
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:41,441
I always used to say that our 
civilization is based on science and 

138
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:41,990
technology.
And so in democracies,

139
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,000
if your democracy is going to function 
properly,

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,240
then people need to know about the 
cutting edge discoveries and the things 

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,710
that we found out which form the basis 
of our civilization.

142
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,780
Otherwise,
how can your democracy function 

143
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,421
properly.
So that's partly the responsibility of 

144
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,231
the education system of course,
but I see actually the media on the 

145
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:07,181
Internet and actually on television and 
radio as part of the education system 

146
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:11,000
now I know that the media doesn't see 
itself as that often exceeds itself as a

147
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,590
a corporate effort to generate money for
shareholders that I.

148
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,440
I'd criticize that quite strongly 
actually,

149
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:23,441
and we were fortunate in Britain that 
we've got the BBC whose job it is to be 

150
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,490
part of the education system.
In part it's,

151
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,230
it's.
It is a national institution.

152
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:32,410
So having a strong public service 
broadcaster I think is is one of the 

153
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:32,810
best things you can do as a country.
I mean,

154
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:36,890
imagine a American.
I know it will be an anathema to the big

155
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:41,891
corporations who run the TV channels,
but imagine you had a channel which 

156
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:46,271
which really had a lot of money to BBC 
is well funded that everybody 

157
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,691
contributed to in the states whose job 
was to act in the interests of the 

158
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:51,080
nation,
whose job it was to say,

159
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,340
well,
we're going to put these.

160
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,070
We're going to make these big signs 
documentaries and put them on,

161
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,500
and yet we'll make entertainment shows 
and drama shows as well.

162
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,620
We're going to make them because we 
think people need to know this stuff.

163
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,470
We want to infuse the next generation of
scientists and engineers.

164
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,510
That's.
That's important actually.

165
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,180
It's important not to expose people 
continually to,

166
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,640
to,
you know,

167
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,290
drivel basically populists driven 
because people.

168
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,220
I think you're right.
People want to think,

169
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,170
I really believed that people are 
interested.

170
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,210
I rarely go into a bar or a restaurant 
or a party and people say,

171
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,290
what do you do?
And anybody say,

172
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:29,291
well,
I work at the large Hadron collider at 

173
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,301
cern in Geneva.
We recreate the conditions that were 

174
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:31,301
present less than a billion two the 
second after the big bang.

175
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,610
It's very rare that someone just says 
whatever and it goes until somebody else

176
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,570
they're interested.
Sure.

177
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,530
So I,
uh,

178
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,540
yeah,
I think the,

179
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,760
and maybe you're right,
the optimistic view as you say,

180
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:44,990
is that the,
the,

181
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,991
the Internet,
we'll remove this culprit layer of 

182
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:51,140
middle management in a way this kind of 
the television executive,

183
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,980
but maybe if you can remove that filter.
She's like,

184
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,510
I thought

185
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,250
the malfunctioning kidney in the flow of
information,

186
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,170
maybe it,
it,

187
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,140
it's a,
it's a good thing in a way it is,

188
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,570
uh,
it's,

189
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,920
it's really kind of an archaic idea.
The idea that you know,

190
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:08,610
at,
you know,

191
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
Thursday night at 8:00,
that's when the show airs,

192
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,680
airs for an hour.
Well now you could of course dvr things 

193
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,460
and you can,
of course there's a lot of television 

194
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,460
shows up,
things on demand,

195
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,060
so you can download them later.
But I think that that's the model,

196
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:26,061
the model is the distribution through 
the internet and this idea of sending 

197
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:29,691
things through the satellites and all 
the way they're doing it now with 

198
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:29,691
television networks,
it's like it's.

199
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:31,350
It's not gonna work,
it's not gonna last,

200
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,700
as soon as companies like Netflix and 
now Amazon is creating their own 

201
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,211
television shows as well.
There are Internet based companies and 

202
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:45,591
they truly understand what the Internet 
is all about and when Amazon or rather 

203
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,930
when Netflix releases a series,
they released the entire series who can 

204
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,710
download like all 10 episodes,
you can binge watch them,

205
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,500
which is a great way to get people 
hooked on shows as well.

206
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,100
This idea that the only way you're going
to watch something is if it's on NBC or 

207
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,020
CBS or ABC and then those people that 
run those networks,

208
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:05,910
they're in a panic because they got to 
get people to watch.

209
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,911
So they'll throw on some reality show.
But housewives that are fighting to the 

210
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,650
death and people tune in.
I mean this is I hosted fear factor.

211
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:14,110
You know,
I,

212
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:19,111
I understand what they're doing.
I was a part of the problem or part of 

213
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:22,581
the solution,
if that's what you wanted to watch on 

214
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:22,581
television,
you know,

215
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:22,590
the,
they're just trying to get by,

216
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,980
like they're just trying to figure out 
what's the next American idol,

217
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:27,290
what's the next,
you know,

218
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,800
whatever.
Show the voice,

219
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:33,801
like what do I have to do to get 18 
million people who sit in front and 

220
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,341
watch a ball being passed from one man 
to the other and they try to get across 

221
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:37,560
the line and everybody goes crazy.

222
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,920
This,
this idea that that's the only way we 

223
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,881
can get our information.
The only way you're going to get 

224
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,760
entertainment or any,
anything that's coming at you that's 

225
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:49,920
being produced and created,
that's dead.

226
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,970
They.
What I find interesting about this 

227
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,740
debate there is it,
the media is obviously tremendously 

228
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,430
powerful.
Obviously they,

229
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,560
they interface between most people and 
ideas.

230
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,320
Um,
and so I worry about,

231
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,450
uh,
the,

232
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,490
the increase of choice in a sense.
So it's a very good thing in some 

233
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,691
respects,
but in other respects that you can get 

234
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:14,691
to eyes,
audiences,

235
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,440
audiences will become,
get to.

236
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
Yes.
So let's say that for example,

237
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:20,280
I am interested in playing computer 
games,

238
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,240
so,
so as a,

239
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:23,700
as a 17 year old something interview,
if that's what you're into,

240
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,880
you can just watch that 24 slash seven 
you just so you're not exposed to new 

241
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:31,930
ideas.
So I would say is that choice really the

242
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,280
choice is really what you mean is 
enfolding choice.

243
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,430
So you mean well here,
here's the spread of ideas that our 

244
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,581
culture has generated over you no more 
than 3000 years of civilization and you,

245
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,440
you will stumble across things you 
didn't know about.

246
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:48,930
Maybe you become interested in ancient 
Egypt.

247
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:50,770
Maybe it could become interested in the,
the,

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,430
the evolution of Homo Sapiens,
the Rift Valley 200,000

249
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,960
years ago.
Maybe you find that fascinating,

250
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,500
but it,
if you're not exposed to those ideas,

251
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,530
oh,
and culture has no way of exposing you 

252
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,060
to those ideas beyond the education 
system.

253
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,700
Then we were in a.
We have a problem.

254
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So I,
I don't know what the solution is to 

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,000
this,
but I think that there's,

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,850
there's a,
there's something to be said.

257
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:17,851
It will never come back now.
But the old fashioned model that we had 

258
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:20,200
in Britain for many years,
where the BBC was really quite dominant,

259
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,850
was that you could almost,
you could say,

260
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:24,040
well,
we're going to put x factor on,

261
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:29,041
let's say,
or dancing with the stars or whatever 

262
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,721
that thing is.
And then after we're going to put a 

263
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:31,790
documentary on about astronomy and the 
idea is that some of that,

264
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,960
the people who were watching the talent 
show it will drift into the documentary 

265
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,651
guy I didn't know I was interested in 
the moon of Jupiter called Europa as an 

266
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,660
ocean surrounding it.
They may have life on it.

267
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:47,661
I didn't know that.
I didn't know I was interested and that 

268
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:48,280
that model works.
So you're right though,

269
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:49,390
it's gone.
Probably.

270
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,010
So I think the great challenge is how do
you,

271
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,620
how do you expose people to new ideas in
our culture?

272
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,890
How do you get debates going?
How do you stimulate that kind of 

273
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,580
excitement about knowledge in this new 
media world?

274
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,180
Maybe you know,

275
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,260
but you're sort of an evangelist in that
sense.

276
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,510
Then you're.
I don't mean it in in a religious way.

277
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,160
I mean,
you're,

278
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:12,161
you're someone who evangelizes about the
ideas of science and of space like you 

279
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,000
think it's very important to spread 
these ideas and that 17 year old kid who

280
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,940
watched his video games all day,
which easily could've been me,

281
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,820
that that kid will never break out of 
that mold.

282
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,420
I think that the.
I think the 17 year old kid,

283
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:29,421
if he wants to,
if he really is completely obsessed and 

284
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:32,511
he wants to watch video games all day,
the only thing that's going to fix that 

285
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,680
is just going to eventually get bored 
and he's going to want to try something 

286
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,200
new and having the infinite options that
are available today.

287
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,630
Someone could send him a text.
Dude,

288
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,270
three words.
Infinite monkey cage.

289
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,890
Yeah,
Google it and the guy,

290
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:44,550
he'll be right.

291
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Shit,
I'm bored with video games and then 

292
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,460
he'll have access to all kinds of shit 
that like if he was just waiting for the

293
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:54,500
BBC to spoon feed him,
he's never going to do it.

294
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,570
Also,
I think that having the stupid shows 

295
00:13:59,570 --> 00:13:59,940
that we have here in America,
like if you watch reality shows,

296
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:04,941
one of the things that you'll notice is 
the anger that people have about these 

297
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:09,081
shows,
the anger that to being forced fed this 

298
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:09,510
fucking stupid shit,
but they're still watching it.

299
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,010
That anger sometimes that,
that,

300
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:18,230
that rejection of it almost in your soul
forces people to go explore other ideas 

301
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,050
or it inspires people to go explore 
other ideas.

302
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,150
Interesting muddle,
isn't it?

303
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Frustrate the to deploy.
Just suddenly get so angry about the Ama

304
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,880
Guide,
soul crushing.

305
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,700
It was the building this culture that 
you go seek out knowledge.

306
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,060
Maybe that there's something to it,
man,

307
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:47,061
because one time I was in my hotel room 
and I was watching keeping up with the 

308
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:47,550
Kardashians and uh,
you know,

309
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,170
look,
it was in between shows like,

310
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,230
you know,
just flipping through the channels and 

311
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,290
it was on and it was like,
I'm shopping and I can't find what I 

312
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:56,750
want to get.

313
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,020
This is so frustrating and my sister 
won't stop bothering me.

314
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,440
And they're like texting each other and 
it's so fucking mind numbing.

315
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,510
And somehow or another I'm sucked into 
it like it's a tornado and it's carrying

316
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,550
away up into the sky and then I changed 
the next channel and it's some biology 

317
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:18,761
thing on crocodiles and it's instantly 
fascinating and it's these people that 

318
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:23,861
live on denial and this scientist who's 
down there and he's studying these 

319
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:27,731
crocodiles and you know,
there's the villagers who are worried 

320
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:27,731
about these things eating them.
And then I'm thinking,

321
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:28,940
wow,
this is so fucking fascinating.

322
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,180
These people are living next to 
dinosaurs.

323
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,770
I mean they have a real issue with 
dinosaurs eating their family like.

324
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Or You could watch these just simple 
apes talk about shiny things and they'll

325
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,340
talk about shiny things and millions of 
fucking people do,

326
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,190
but that the,
the anger of can't take this anymore.

327
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,340
And then you switched the channel or go 
online.

328
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,490
I really think that does.
There's a yin and a Yang to the world,

329
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,520
the strongest case for the cadets that 
compresses your very soul and existence 

330
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,430
into such a small space that you out 
into a world of ideas.

331
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,550
So that that's what's analogous to 
California.

332
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,980
Because in California we have too much 
sun.

333
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,720
We have so much sun that it doesn't 
rain.

334
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,900
We need 11 trillion gallons of water 
just to make up for the water that 

335
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,550
didn't rain in the last three years.
It's a fucking disaster,

336
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,180
but if you lived in a place like Alaska 
in the winter where there's no fucking 

337
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:34,091
son at all and just looking for little 
peaks in the clouds or those those days 

338
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,070
in Portland where it's just 39 days in a
row,

339
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,680
there's no fucking son.
You just did crazy.

340
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:44,681
You can't take it anymore,
and then one day that sun is there and 

341
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:44,681
you're like,
ah,

342
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,640
it's so beautiful.

343
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,950
Some May.
Whereas in La were like,

344
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,290
fucking son,
we're so tired of the sun.

345
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,020
We just.
People get used to shit.

346
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:56,500
I'm going to call it the Rogan muddle 
when she's.

347
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,560
When she's just depressed.
Every rogue of muddle the broadcast in 

348
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:06,630
the fuck out of them and they'll surely 
at some point the cosmos.

349
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Yes,
and then when it comes on and then they 

350
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,020
get it.
Well not everyone.

351
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:18,710
There's gonna be some people that are 
always going to be.

352
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,050
They're going to always gravitate 
towards nonsense.

353
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,490
There's nothing you can do about that.
It's just we're so varied.

354
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:30,491
We're so the,
the spectrum of human beings from the 

355
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,450
smartest to the dumbest is so wide.
There's no getting around that.

356
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,160
Life experiences,
genetics,

357
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:35,690
whatever causes it.
I don't know,

358
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,870
but there's just certain people that do 
not give a fuck and they're going to 

359
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,410
always be there,
but concentrating on them,

360
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,340
you know,
and,

361
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:43,850
and,
and,

362
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,930
and like it's profitable.
Like you could sell them shit.

363
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,100
It's a really good if you're,
if you're

364
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,850
in the business,
he days.

365
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,980
Uh,
I still,

366
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:55,910
you said Lee though I'm perhaps 
optimistic of Va.

367
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,910
I think you could.
I think we can sell them.

368
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,290
It sounds almost them,
this group.

369
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,870
Some of them you could sell it.
I,

370
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,110
I still think you can sell ideas to 
people.

371
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:09,960
I'm going to mystic about it.
Those people maybe not,

372
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:14,961
but there's a lot of fucking people.
There's $350 million people in this 

373
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:15,580
country alone.
we underestimate people.

374
00:18:15,581 --> 00:18:16,230
I think I,
I've,

375
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,850
I've rarely met someone who wasn't 
interested in.

376
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,100
Let me take your sound.
Are you going to take home and bring it 

377
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,220
around some dummies?
There's some fucking dummies out there.

378
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,160
a lot of smart folks like yourself.
You're hanging out at cern,

379
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,370
will a bunch of other physicists.
You're talking about black holes and 

380
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:34,370
chelation effect.
You're right.

381
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,660
I've never been into the cafeteria at 
certain.

382
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
Anyone who's not interested in asking 
me,

383
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:44,361
man,
I hosted fear factor for six years and 

384
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:44,361
I'm a cage fighting commentator.

385
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:49,160
There's dummIes out there,
there's a unfixable dummies and it's 

386
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:54,621
probably not their fault,
but it's probably one of the greatest 

387
00:18:54,621 --> 00:18:57,981
pieces of evidence to do that.
Points towards natural selection and 

388
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,600
point sorts of variability of life and 
that human beings.

389
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:05,550
We very so strongly that in comparison 
to other wild animals,

390
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,700
if you see wolves,
me and you see wolves that are slightly 

391
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,241
larger and slightly more dominant and 
wolves that are slightly smaller and 

392
00:19:14,241 --> 00:19:14,670
slightly more timid and they get pushed 
out of the pack,

393
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,790
but they're all fucking wolves.
You See people and you see Brian Cox and

394
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:24,831
then you see kim kardashians.
I mean you guys are both on the same 

395
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:28,371
timeline here.
You're both alive in this point in 

396
00:19:28,371 --> 00:19:31,371
history and one of you is talking about 
fucking shoes and the other one is 

397
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,570
trying to figure out what happened right
after the big bang and one of them has a

398
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,370
fuck load more people paying attention.

399
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:40,370
Brian cox and it ate you buddy.
It's the chick with the fake ass was 

400
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,110
getting all the eyeballs.
Carl sagan is great book,

401
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,450
the demon haunted world.
I love that book.

402
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,690
I mean,
he makes the point that the thing is 

403
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:50,690
these people,
everyone has a vote and rightly so.

404
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,410
We live in a democracy right now.
You mIght say,

405
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,240
well,
could we have some kInd of icu,

406
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,280
such threshold for the votes,
but therefore the direction of our 

407
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,820
societies ease in principle in the hands
of everyone.

408
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,070
So,
so we can't just accept the fact that 

409
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,070
you know,
well,

410
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,721
all right,
well one percent of the world's 

411
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,221
population is going to pay attention to,
to reality and the rest of them are 

412
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,910
going to pay attention to reality tv and
they're going to be,

413
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,090
we're going to be okay.
We're not going to be okay because the 

414
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,290
99 percent will be on the web.
They're voting for that.

415
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:25,310
They have control and rightly so.
We live in a over the direction of our 

416
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,390
countries.
So education is extremely important.

417
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:32,391
It is important for people to sit,
for us to try and make available the 

418
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,460
great swathe of knowledge that we've 
accumulated over the last.

419
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,270
We were absolutely in agreement about 
that.

420
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,540
I just think that the open nature of the
internet enhances that more than stifles

421
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,350
it.
I think

422
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,930
there's only good.
I only see good.

423
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,140
I think I'm a big fan of old shit.
I love to go watch old television shows 

424
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,520
and old,
um,

425
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,760
old movies and old especially old 
standup comedy performances because 

426
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,230
there's not just because it's sort of 
like a time machine.

427
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:05,590
You're,
you're,

428
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,230
you're lookIng back at this moment 
that's been captured,

429
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:13,231
which is absolutely fascinating to me.
But also the stark differences to the 

430
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:18,150
obvious differences between culture then
and culture now between the awareness of

431
00:21:18,371 --> 00:21:21,610
the people that like there's some movies
that were really good movies,

432
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,930
but if you try to wash them today,
you go,

433
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:24,370
oh,
who's that fucking dumb today?

434
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,740
Like no one is that dumb today.
It's hard.

435
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:31,300
Like the education level of the people 
that are communicating in these movies,

436
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,450
the way they're there,
they view life is very obviously 

437
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:36,880
different than the way we view life 
today.

438
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Like you could noT put father knows best
on television today because people 

439
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,510
wouldn't fucking.
They're not like not enough.

440
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Nope.
You gotta it's gotta go to a higher 

441
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,050
frequency because human beings are very 
different today than they were in 1950.

442
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,500
I think our culture is one of the 
clearest influences.

443
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,460
There's some amazing stuff from 1950,
so amazing books that were written.

444
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:02,461
There's amazing films that were made,
but the reality is the culture has 

445
00:22:02,461 --> 00:22:04,690
shifted dramatically in the last 64 
years.

446
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,260
there's no getting around that.
It's changing and I think having 

447
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,070
something like the internet just pushes 
that in a direction and the guidelines.

448
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,930
You who gets upset,
a guy like you who gets upset,

449
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:19,750
all these reality shows,
it's really just proof that that this is

450
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:24,751
what you're designed to do.
You're like designed to educate these 

451
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:25,240
people that are annoying you in these 
programs that are stupid.

452
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,450
That's actually just fuel.
It's just giving you more.

453
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,600
It's giving you an adversary.
It's giving you motivation to stop it 

454
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,420
from happening.
I mean it's.

455
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:39,421
If everybody was going to college and 
everybody was super educated and really 

456
00:22:39,421 --> 00:22:44,221
aware of the problems with plastic and 
fossil fuels and boy,

457
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,260
what a weird world we live in,
probably nothing would ever get done.

458
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Like the battle between the dummies and 
the people like yourself is essential.

459
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:55,850
It's essential.
Then yang idea,

460
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,900
the thesis that the defining the motor 
of civilization and human advancement is

461
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,050
irritation with dumb people.
I think it is.

462
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,420
I don't appreciate naps unless I work 
out hard.

463
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,590
I don't appreciate vacations unless I'm 
just exhausted.

464
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,880
I have to be exhausted with work to 
appreciate vacations.

465
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,230
I must say.
It's one of the threads,

466
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,910
so maybe we started talking about 
infinite monkey cage.

467
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:23,911
He's one of the threads through the 
whole series is a slight annoyance that 

468
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:26,410
we turned into into something that's 
interesting.

469
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:27,400
Generates ideas,
pros,

470
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,040
I mean one of the.
We had a letter about the title,

471
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,270
the infinite monkey cage complaining and
they shouldn't catch monkeys.

472
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,980
It was cruel.
Crew is like an infinite.

473
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,390
It's an infinite cage.
It's me.

474
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,930
It's recently love room.
It's arguably the universe.

475
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:46,220
There's an infinite cage and then 
another

476
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,870
less it came in.
I think it might have been a response.

477
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,430
So we'd send that back and they said 
don't.

478
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,240
It's also support in this kind of 
darwinian myth,

479
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,590
the darwinian myth that we're somehow 
share a common ancestor with a monkey.

480
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,860
So how so?
And he said,

481
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,930
well,
there was an experiment done that 

482
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:04,970
disproved all your nonsense,
like experiments.

483
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:07,400
We like evidence.
So This is really interesting.

484
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:12,401
What's the evidence?
So we read down and they said there was 

485
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:15,341
an experiment done in a zoo in Alabama 
or somewhere where they got 10 monkeys 

486
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,250
and they gave them tight writers and 
after a week all they done was shit on 

487
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:26,231
them.
So the idea that an infinite number of 

488
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:26,570
monkeys could write shakespeare and all 
that,

489
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:32,270
it's like,
well there's a difference between 10 

490
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,170
monkeys and an infinite number of 
monkeys.

491
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,450
There's not,
you know,

492
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,250
10 is not very close to infinity and 
it's just these complaints about the.

493
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,470
And we were my,
my friend robin into our co presented 

494
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,470
where the.
He said,

495
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,490
he said it's not an incremental process,
this kind of infinite monkey thing.

496
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:51,610
It's not like if you have 100 monkeys 
then eventually they'll produce a 

497
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,780
leaflet and then if you have a thousand 
they'll do maybe a book.

498
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,680
if you had 10,000
they'll do shakespeare.

499
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,630
And it's not really,
we mean it,

500
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,220
it's an infinite number of monkeys.
You'd need to type out the words.

501
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,070
But yeah,
we got a lot of.

502
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,110
We enjoy the complaint.
So we've got a lot from.

503
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,700
Yeah.
Got a lot of complaints from deepak 

504
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:11,700
chopra.
Actually,

505
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:11,700
these days he's a silly version late,
isn't it?

506
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,360
Isn't that one of those things that,
that,

507
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,440
that.
That's like one of those expressions 

508
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,991
that people always use it.
If you take an infinite number of 

509
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:21,851
monkeys and given the typewriters,
they'll type out shakespeare's works of 

510
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:21,851
shakespeare.

511
00:25:21,851 --> 00:25:21,980
It's just,
is that true?

512
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,160
While it is true,
it's an infinite number of monkeys have 

513
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,160
infinite number.
I think they're going to fail.

514
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,670
They're going to fuck it up.
No monkeys.

515
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,510
You don't know who's still wonky with 
talking to me earlier about infinity,

516
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:37,511
you know,
but if you get an infinite number of 

517
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:37,511
monkeys aren't there,
there's the same animal,

518
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,730
so the same exact animal.
They're going to type the exact works of

519
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,880
shakespeare that they will because 
there's an infinite number of nuts.

520
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,030
Every possible combination of less 
oppressive must happen.

521
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,670
Dan is true.
Would it happen?

522
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,700
What is the odds of it happening in the 
exact same order of the works of 

523
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,630
shakespeare isn't even calculus than 
zero.

524
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:02,020
Less than zero,
but integrated in there so that if 

525
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,460
you've got an infinite number of them 
and then,

526
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,080
then you will get everything that can 
possibly happen.

527
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Will happen,
could you imagine if one monkey just 

528
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:11,320
randomly,
they gave it a key,

529
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,340
you know what we're talking about the 
entire universe,

530
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:18,341
right?
So we're talking about an infinite 

531
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,421
number,
but what if they just get lucky as fuck 

532
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,560
and give one monkey a typewriter and 
this little dude just starts banging out

533
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:24,200
the entire works of shakespeare,
but he's still a monkey.

534
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,870
He's stIll like playing with his butt 
and you know,

535
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,950
swInging around and having a good time.
He's not doing anything else other than 

536
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,720
when they put them in front of this 
keyboard.

537
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,200
He types out all the works of 
shakespeare in exactly the right order,

538
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,650
the exact punctuatIon,
the exact spaces in between letters.

539
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,470
Well,
if the universe is infinite,

540
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,980
which it may

541
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,480
well be,
in fact,

542
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,600
there are many ways the universe can be 
infinite,

543
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,310
then,
um,

544
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,340
that would happen because everything 
that is in accord with the laws of 

545
00:26:55,711 --> 00:26:57,900
physics,
then it can happen.

546
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,200
And everything that can happen in an 
infinite universe will happen because 

547
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,600
the universe is formerly infinite.
So I contend,

548
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,660
and we'll probably get emails about.
I'm trying to think whether there's any 

549
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:11,660
counter argument.
I don't think there is.

550
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,771
I contend that in an infinite universe,
even the most unlIkely possibility must 

551
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:20,961
happen,
in fact formally an infinite number of 

552
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:21,240
times,
so maybe shakespeare,

553
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,460
a monkey,
they just looked.

554
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,960
Maybe if someone's pet monkey,
we can imagine.

555
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,800
We can calculate it

556
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,960
when someone can do it online now 
because there are how many letters are 

557
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,050
there in shakespeare,
the complete works of shakespeare so you

558
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:41,051
can google that.
Someone will tell you and we know 26 

559
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:41,630
possibilities and so off we go,
and so,

560
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,120
so how?
What's the probability?

561
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:47,310
What are the odds of randomly typing on 
site writer,

562
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,770
let's say at one letter per second,
how long will it take and what are the 

563
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,750
odds that your type out the complete 
works of shakespeare?

564
00:27:53,751 --> 00:27:56,510
That's a no number.
I don't know where my head,

565
00:27:56,511 --> 00:28:01,511
but it can be calculated,
so that's my challenge to your viewers 

566
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:02,660
and listeners sending that email.
Someone will do it.

567
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,030
There'll be someone working at mit or 
something.

568
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,980
you can do it in five minutes.
that's an easy song

569
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,200
and then you'd have to calculate how 
many monkeys start out with romeo and 

570
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,060
juliet and then just start shitting on 
their typewriter.

571
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,350
That I.
I know the answer to that is more than 

572
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,760
the other ones and the first chapter.
Perfect.

573
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,630
And then just shit all over the place.
The last word.

574
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,700
The last single digit.
Well,

575
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:31,701
I bet every keystroke along the way 
there's a monkey shitting on their 

576
00:28:31,701 --> 00:28:32,520
typewriter.
Like you get like the first paragraph.

577
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,280
Shit all over the place.
This guy got to the second paragraph.

578
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:35,790
Shit all over it.

579
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,850
Place to go back to having a monkey cage
complaint letter that proves that 

580
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:40,850
darwin's wrong.
Hey,

581
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,980
that's the Logic that.
Yeah.

582
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:45,570
Can I just say that if someone doesn't 
remember,

583
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:47,540
I just came into the podcast at that 
point.

584
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:47,580
Yeah.

585
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,320
No he doesn't.
Yeah,

586
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,210
you can't cherry pick that quote.
yeah.

587
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:53,340
Just Brian Cox has nothing darwin's 
wrong.

588
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,210
That'll be in the press.
There's a great website,

589
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,240
a twitter handle called take that darwin
where people that are educationally 

590
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:06,210
challenged will question darwin's 
theories like that.

591
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,690
My favorite one is,
you know,

592
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,040
people came from monkeys.
Monkeys are still around like dave 

593
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,510
retweet that all day because someone 
adjust that fundamental misunderstanding

594
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:17,580
of evolution that that really is,
you know,

595
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,250
you're going right where I'm going to 
start maybe with the book.

596
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,520
The only wAy to truly test is to,
I think we'll really need to do is take 

597
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,620
monkeys and give them psychedelic drugs.
We need to do this.

598
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Someone needs to do this.
Didn't need to take an island where the 

599
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,380
monkeys can't escape and give them 
psychedelic drugs and leave them puzzles

600
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,560
and see what they figured out.
Why does that test anything doesn't.

601
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:41,980
I would just be fun

602
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,980
to watch.
There is a.

603
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,990
A guy named terrence mckenna who I'm a 
huge fan of who had a a theory called 

604
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,100
the stoned ape theory and he backed it 
up,

605
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,160
allegedly remember who this is coming 
from a with climate to logical data on 

606
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,950
that time of the world that he believes 
that the evolution of human beings,

607
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,240
the a big part of it,
the development of the human brain might

608
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:10,690
have come from them experimenting with 
psychedelic mushrooms.

609
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,810
That as the rain forest receded into 
grasslands,

610
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,140
animals were forced to try new foods out
because their habitat was changing and 

611
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:24,211
they would climb down for these trees 
and flip over these cow patties to get 

612
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:27,310
bugs and worms and things along those 
lines and that this time of the world,

613
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,580
it was very common to have these 
psilocybin mushrooms growing all over 

614
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:32,860
the place and that the monkeys that 
would eat them,

615
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,010
he had a bunch of theories like 
apparently it's been proven that in low 

616
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,450
doses,
psilocybin increases visual acuity,

617
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,640
which would make you able to see things 
better,

618
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,820
which would make you a better hunter 
also makes you horny so it would make 

619
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,931
people more likely to breed and that 
would favor the people or the monkeys 

620
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:51,931
rather.

621
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:53,650
The,
the subhuman primates,

622
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,650
whatever you call them,
that that went along that line.

623
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,770
What is it is one of them.
Will I be accepted theories about 

624
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,740
hominid evolution is that is that 
climate change played a key role and 

625
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,130
actually there's in my life to say 
receiving universe,

626
00:31:09,131 --> 00:31:13,000
we.
We focused on a a theory which links the

627
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:18,001
climate change,
particularly in the rift valley because 

628
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,340
we know that the big jumps in brain size
all occurred and enriched valley of 

629
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,320
africa and it's quite remarkable 
actually and that that broadly speaking,

630
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:28,321
accepted.
I think although I love argument with 

631
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:28,321
anthropologists because the dates or his
spouse,

632
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:33,090
you know,
but it's broadly accepted that and it 

633
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,281
seems that the big gym sitting in brain 
size occurred at times when the soul 

634
00:31:35,281 --> 00:31:38,250
bates was most elliptical.
So the slb oscillates.

635
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,260
It becomes more elliptical than most 
circular and there are many different 

636
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,781
oscillations driven by gravitational 
interaction with the planets like 

637
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:49,171
jupiter in particular,
and it seems like when the ssl based 

638
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:52,240
mostly elliptical the the rate of 
climate change and the rift valley is 

639
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,700
higher and more extreme and it seems to 
be the case that this relatively strong 

640
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:03,151
evidence for the case that when you get 
these rapid times of climate change you 

641
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:06,541
mentioned,
then you get increases in hominin brain 

642
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,631
size and therefore increase in 
intelligence is a big wig at one point 

643
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:09,631
eight.

644
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:13,350
One point 8 million years ago,
which was a very big increase in the 

645
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,480
number of species in the rift valley,
of which homo erectus was one of them,

646
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,160
which eventually led to us and a big a 
big jump in brain size as well,

647
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:24,880
and this was at a time when there was 
strong evidence for rapid climate change

648
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,990
in that,
in that region.

649
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,260
So that makes sense.
Like the adaptability of these animals 

650
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,950
experimented with new food sources,
trying out new hunting methods.

651
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,140
They,
a lot of them changed from herbivore,

652
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,900
omnivore a lot of the primates that were
observed.

653
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,500
Right.
I get it.

654
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,980
That's where it gets controversial

655
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,660
when you look at the academic research 
because the what,

656
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,880
so you the darwinian idea that.
So you get this pressure from climate 

657
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,930
change,
but then what's the selection effect?

658
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,510
Because climaTe change happens over many
generations,

659
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,550
it doesn't happen over one generation.
so.

660
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,630
so the question is,
well,

661
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:59,270
what actually is doing the selecting?
What are we selecting for?

662
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:04,271
Why is this group I'm more likely to 
breed and be more successful if it's 

663
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:05,510
more intelligent?
So some people say,

664
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,580
well it's because we,
they were forced into groups,

665
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,480
so it's group dynamics is the fact that 
you end up with bigger tribes,

666
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:16,481
you know,
hundreds of individuals cooperating 

667
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:18,371
together and that's what's been selected
for and you need to be intelligent for 

668
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:18,371
that.
Some people say as you said,

669
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:23,021
that it's more adaptability,
so maybe they have to learn to go 

670
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:26,381
fishing or they have to learn to eat a 
particular different crops and then 

671
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:26,381
maybe that's.

672
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:28,600
So that's a big area of debate about 
what might have been the,

673
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:30,410
the,
the selection pressure,

674
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:33,680
this precise selection pressure.
But it does seem pretty nAiled down that

675
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:37,130
climate change certainly in that region 
of africa,

676
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,160
in Ethiopia and Tanzania and through the
rift valley had played a role in driving

677
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:44,590
us towards intelligence and essentially 
shape scales.

678
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,620
Very small.
By the way.

679
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:50,621
I mean,
did you go back 4 million years and 

680
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:51,830
you'll.
things like australopithecus are around.

681
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:53,660
We should basically outright 
chimpanzees.

682
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,850
The brain is not much bigger than a 
modern day chimp.

683
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,390
But then you go to 200,000
years ago and that's when homosapiens 

684
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,990
first emerge and just over 200,000
years,

685
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:06,140
which is not very long ago,
and it's quite remarkable actually,

686
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,290
and that the modern theories,
they get spread out of africa that 

687
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,381
60,000
years ago and they made it into europe 

688
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:17,201
about 43,000
years ago also into north America and 

689
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,020
south America only 15,000
years ago.

690
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,900
So it's a very,
quite a rapid spread.

691
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,200
And the fact that we've only been around
as a species for at most a quarter of a 

692
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,820
million years,
a quarter of 1 million years is quite 

693
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:30,820
remarkable.
I think.

694
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,780
Well,
when you think about what we've 

695
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:33,780
accomplished,
I was flying into los angeles last night

696
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,820
and I was thinking if you could take the
pioneers that came from europe in the 17

697
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:44,071
and 18 hundreds.
The guys who were on those wagons with 

698
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:47,911
the wooden wheels and they're pulling 
them with horses across the country 

699
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:49,030
trying to see what's over there.
If you could show them like,

700
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:54,031
hey man,
this is what's going to go down in 2015 

701
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:54,031
hop on this plane.
Look out this window.

702
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,330
Oh,
look at that grid.

703
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,410
TheY would freak the fuck out.
They saw all the electricity.

704
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,740
That's the sky of los angeles,
in my opinion.

705
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Los angeles.
More beautiful at night than any other 

706
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,540
city because it's so spread out.
It's all lights as you're flying in.

707
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,530
It looks so science fiction.
You know,

708
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:11,940
I,
I,

709
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:12,250
um,

710
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,710
recently interviewed the astronaut 
charlie duke who landed on the moon,

711
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,770
the apollo astronauts.
And he said to me,

712
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,690
his father couldn't believe it because 
he,

713
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,140
he was alive when the wright brothers 
flew.

714
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:28,630
So he,
his father's spanned the time from the 

715
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,330
wright brothers to an,
he was alive and then he,

716
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,640
some walked on the moon in one lifetime,
60 years.

717
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,690
Seventy years.

718
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,500
The real,
the real mind fuck is

719
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:43,140
with the creation of the plane to the 
time someone dropped an atomic bomb from

720
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,230
the plane is less than 50 years.
Yeah.

721
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,910
And the nuclear physics,
we didn't know.

722
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,690
We didn't know there was an italian.
Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus

723
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,920
in manchester in a.
Was it 1912 or so?

724
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,880
I should know.
But anyway,

725
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:57,990
17,
19,

726
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,170
12 and 13.
So he discovers the nucleus and within 

727
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:05,370
30 years you have an atomic bomb,
didn't even know.

728
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,500
And,
and rutherford we actually asked at the 

729
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:10,500
time,
he said,

730
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:10,500
it's the usual question we get as 
physicists.

731
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,730
They say,
what's the use of this?

732
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:12,960
And uh,
and,

733
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,970
and rutherford said that there's no use 
to it.

734
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:19,971
You said anyone who thinks that you 
could use this as an energy source is 

735
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:22,701
talking moonshine and within 30 or 40 
years you have nuclear reactors 

736
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,530
producing power and you have atomic 
bombs.

737
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,140
A rapid rapid progress.
Well,

738
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:32,020
that's one thing that's been constant 
about people and predicting the future.

739
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,990
And we've always got it wrong.
Oh,

740
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:34,270
well,
we,

741
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,810
we miss some of the rapid advances.
You know,

742
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,630
we talked about,
you know,

743
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,710
there's a computer on a phone here.
You're the fact that the modern 

744
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,290
electronics is a single lifetime.
The transistor is what,

745
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:51,291
19 forties,
I think bell labs here in the us not 

746
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,920
long ago.
You know that you go from that to this.

747
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:58,130
I mean we talked about the apollo.
I mean this is significantly more 

748
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,131
powerful than anything that was 
available in the world when apollo was 

749
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:04,971
there.
The room rooms filled with computers at 

750
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:08,721
nasa,
which we're nowhere near as powerful as 

751
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:08,721
that.
It's amazing.

752
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:11,330
I mean that's those google glasses that 
people are wearing is a sign of things 

753
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:11,910
to come.
In my opinion,

754
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,870
they just stopped making them.

755
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,230
But there,
there's a new company that has like a 

756
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:21,021
goggle.
It looks like a skiing goggle and it 

757
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:21,570
allows you to move things in front of 
you like a virtual desktop.

758
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:24,270
You can spin squares,
hold things in place,

759
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,340
throw things to the side,
and they disappear.

760
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,090
I mean,
we're,

761
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,800
we're going to get really,
really,

762
00:37:28,801 --> 00:37:31,350
really weird within the next couple 
decades.

763
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,950
I've actually seen some of that 
technology is a company called magic 

764
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,590
leap and I've been there in miami.
So you saw it in person.

765
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,230
What does it look really?
It does indeed.

766
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,720
Um,
you,

767
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,710
you can put three d objects into your 
field of vision.

768
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,630
So how is that working?
So you've,

769
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,480
you've actually seen it.
I said,

770
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,930
dad,
you can't talk,

771
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,300
but I'll tell you that it works.
It's a remarkable thing about google.

772
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:53,590
It just bought the company.
Actually we,

773
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,020
yeah,
we played it.

774
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:00,080
We played some videos of it and we 
couldn't figure out whether we were 

775
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,080
watching a simulation.

776
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,670
We're watching what the future holds or 
we're watching an actual demonstration 

777
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:04,810
of that technology.
Yeah.

778
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,270
Oh,
it's going to be impressive.

779
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:11,271
I think.
And it's interesting what You said 

780
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:11,271
because it brings the,
the,

781
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:11,271
the,
the,

782
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:14,590
the web this limited information into 
your field of vision so you can 

783
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,470
manipulate it.
And then there are questions about,

784
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,870
well,
what's real and what isn't and who,

785
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,400
who cares.
Anyway,

786
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,850
really.
And it's so interest.

787
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,960
Interesting.
Do you dabble at all in the theory of 

788
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,240
some sort of an artificial world that we
live in,

789
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,960
these ideas of simulation do dabble in 
that or is it just too much?

790
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:34,800
And actually,
I mean the,

791
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:35,220
the,
uh,

792
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,650
a

793
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,250
colleague of mine,
I mentioned,

794
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:41,620
there are some physicists who you think 
that it's a possibility,

795
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,110
a strong possibility that we're living 
in a simulation.

796
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,430
Um,
I mean it's,

797
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,710
you know,
it's speculative out their stuff,

798
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,110
but it's an attempt to explain some 
properties of the universe that are,

799
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,850
that are interesting and unusual.
So,

800
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,640
so one of my favorite,
I think at the moment,

801
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:00,220
piece of cutting edge physics and 
cosmology,

802
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,180
cosmology,
I should say,

803
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,380
the study of the universe,
the origin and evolution of the universe

804
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:07,030
is going through a revolution at the 
moment and he's coming from data.

805
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:12,270
So it's coming from measurements of 
things like the cosmic microwave 

806
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,421
background radiation,
which is the oldest light in the 

807
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:15,421
universe.
We're making it.

808
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,520
So just to rewind and say what that is.
And 380,000

809
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:23,521
years after the big bang,
the universe became transparent for the 

810
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:23,521
first time to light.

811
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:28,440
And that's because it was,
it was cooling down as he would 

812
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,440
expanding and cooling.
Then atoms formed,

813
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,210
it became cool enough for atoms to form.
And at that moment,

814
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,040
very,
very quickly,

815
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:38,260
uh,
the universe becomes transparent and so 

816
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,351
photons of light can travel on through 
the universe and they've been doing so 

817
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:40,960
ever since.
And we can take a photograph of that.

818
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,300
And we have done with a series of 
satellites,

819
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,400
the most recent of which is called 
plank,

820
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,960
which is european satellite.
This up there.

821
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,550
So this is a picture of baby picture of 
the universe as it was 380,000

822
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:53,980
years after the big bang,
and it's very beautiful picture,

823
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,490
but in explaining that a,
that's given support to theories called 

824
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,511
inflationary cosmology theories.
So inflationary cosmology theories say 

825
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:06,400
that before the universe was hot and 
dense,

826
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,950
which we tend to call the big bang 
before that,

827
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:13,951
the universe was still there and he was 
doing something else which was an 

828
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:13,951
exponential expansion.

829
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:17,080
So it was expanding exponentially fast,
way faster than the speed of light.

830
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,350
Then it stops and all the energy that 
was causing that expansion gets dumped 

831
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,080
into space,
heats it up,

832
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,320
and that's what we see as the particles 
and energy today.

833
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,460
So those theories are kind of 
interested,

834
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:34,050
but they also suggest there are.
There are things called eternal 

835
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:38,581
inflation theories that say,
well how long did that period of 

836
00:40:38,581 --> 00:40:39,310
expansion go on for?
And does it all stop at one?

837
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,370
So does it stop in patches?
And if it stops in patches,

838
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,880
you get it stopped a little patch,
you'd get a big bang in the universe and

839
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:48,320
it starts another patch.
You get another big bang the universe,

840
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:54,070
so,
so these theories suggest perhaps there 

841
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:56,770
were an infinite number possibly have a 
big banks in inverted commerce,

842
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,070
which would mean there are an infinite 
number of universities like ours and,

843
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,380
and they're beIng created now all the 
time and they will continue to be 

844
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:05,380
created ever.

845
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,460
so you get this fractal multiverse ever 
growing exponentially fast.

846
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,820
And really bizarrely,
that those theories have some support 

847
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,850
from the,
from the cosmic microwave background.

848
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:18,040
There are theories that explain the 
structures we see.

849
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,610
I should just underline the fact that 
this is speculative in a sentence,

850
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:22,630
but it,
but it's um,

851
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,390
but it's relatively mainstream that.
But one of my colleagues noticed,

852
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,490
some physicists have noticed is if you 
were some kind of omnipotent deity 

853
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,260
programmer and you want it to run what's
called a monte carlo simulation to say,

854
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,900
well,
I'll vary the strength of gravity in one

855
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,270
universe and vary the massive,
the electron and another one.

856
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:46,271
I'm very these physical constants and 
see what happens then this is probably 

857
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:50,291
this kind of thing you do.
This is what he would kind of look like 

858
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,890
so that you can make an argument that 
the universe in some sense looks like 

859
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:59,261
one of these kinds of so called monte 
carlo simulations because it gives you 

860
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:03,221
the possibility of generating every 
possible number of different ratio to 

861
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,290
the strengths of the forces of nature 
and all these things.

862
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,130
So I just have to emphasize this is way 
out there way on the edge,

863
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,340
but it's fun.
And what is fun and interesting though 

864
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,910
is it the wind all the way back,
the inflationary cosmology bit is,

865
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,920
is probably the most widely accepted 
theory at the moment for how the 

866
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,470
universe got to be the way it is and he 
does lend itself to this idea that there

867
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:28,840
may be a multiverse and and it may be 
that in,

868
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,070
in each different pocket universe if 
you'd like.

869
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,810
You can have different physical 
constants.

870
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,940
So most of them wouldn't allow life to 
exist.

871
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,910
But some of them would say our universe 
looks very fine tuned.

872
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:43,280
and if you look at it in a sense it 
looks like that they belong with nature.

873
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,650
We're very slightly different.
You wouldn't get carbon,

874
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:48,830
for example,
produced In stars in large quantities,

875
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,410
which you need in order to the stars 
die,

876
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:55,640
the carbon and the oxygen come out and 
they rican lapse into another generation

877
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:58,550
of stars and solar systems and that's 
how you get the heavy elements that make

878
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:02,390
up our bodies and so all those things 
look you need.

879
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,640
You either try and find an explanation 
for why the laws of nature of the way 

880
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,711
they are or you.
You go to one of these multiverse 

881
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:15,611
theories and say,
well actually goes back to what we 

882
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:17,561
talked about earlier about the infinite 
monkeys and me actually every 

883
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:18,110
possibility occurs in nature and then we
shouldn't.

884
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:23,111
Shouldn't be surprised that we live in a
universe that's seems fine tuned for 

885
00:43:23,111 --> 00:43:26,921
life seems perfect for us to exist in 
because every possible combination of 

886
00:43:27,031 --> 00:43:32,031
the laws of nature exists somewhere,
and this is where cosmology is at the 

887
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:32,390
moment,
is this is genuine.

888
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,600
You could go onto the web and google it,
you'll find a thousand review papers on 

889
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,180
what's called an inflationary cosmology 
and it is cool and interest in actually.

890
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,640
Yeah,
it's beyond that.

891
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,530
It's,
it's very.

892
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,670
The idea of something being infinite and
not just infinite,

893
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,030
but infinite numbers of these infinite 
things,

894
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,590
infinite numbers of infinite 
universities,

895
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,130
these,
these theories exist.

896
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,400
So This idea of computer simulation,
the idea that the world we live in,

897
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:07,681
the universe we live in is a simulation.
That was the question that you asked 

898
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:09,220
actually because we went on as 
beautiful.

899
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:10,900
Don't change a thing.
You stay you.

900
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,610
The idea being that one day if human 
beings continue to increase our 

901
00:44:20,621 --> 00:44:23,140
technological abilities,
one day we're like,

902
00:44:23,141 --> 00:44:28,141
we're talking about this magic leap and 
we're talking about the goggles that 

903
00:44:28,141 --> 00:44:30,190
allow you to see a virtual world.
We're going to,

904
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,070
if we don't ourselves up or get hit

905
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,070
by an asteroid,
we're going to come up with something 

906
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:39,780
that is indistinguishable from the 
reality that we see right now.

907
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,560
And when people start examining the 
nature of the universe and they start 

908
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,301
looking at the fractal nature of things 
and looking at like what you were 

909
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:53,481
saying,
that if you were going to be some 

910
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:53,481
omnipotent deity that creates the 
university,

911
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:57,820
probably do something like this,
like every single combination and throw 

912
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,501
them out there.
So when we discover is is James Gates 

913
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,550
that was the guy's name investigates,
investigates.

914
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:08,810
It was a guy who spoke to neil degrasse 
tyson about string theory and that 

915
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,801
they've found in string theory the 
computer code that was created by humans

916
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:19,131
and like the 19 thirties they.
They figured this out and that this 

917
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:21,480
actually exists in these codes in string
theory.

918
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,600
and his idea was that that somehow 
another proves that there is some 

919
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,900
evidence support that life.

920
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,630
The reality that we see right now is a 
simulation.

921
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:35,640
Or it could be that which way more 
likely that you're just discovering some

922
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:39,420
sort of code that the entire universe is
based on.

923
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:44,660
That.
When you look at things being fractal 

924
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,971
and you look at the idea of there being 
not just infinite expansion but infinite

925
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:49,620
contraction and that there is no 
smallest point.

926
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,930
There's just smaller than we can 
measure.

927
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:55,200
But when we talk about subatomic 
particles and we talk about things being

928
00:45:55,350 --> 00:46:00,350
like adam's being mostly air and then 
you go deeper and deeper and you don't 

929
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,861
know what the fuck is going on and 
particles are blinking in and out of 

930
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,370
existence and existing at the same time,
both moving and still la.

931
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:08,340
but could it be that you just got to 
keep going?

932
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,990
We just can't see it.
Well,

933
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,400
the.
I mean the answer is,

934
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,380
I mean we still have three know what the
fuck's going on.

935
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:17,280
Some level of political.
If you look to the lhc,

936
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:20,970
the large hadron collider,
which is the place where we generate the

937
00:46:20,971 --> 00:46:25,971
highest energy.
So it's the biggest microscope in the 

938
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:25,971
world.
In essence,

939
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:28,290
we have an extremely good understanding 
of the laws of physics at that level and

940
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,380
up to and including the discovery of the
higgs particle.

941
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,500
It's been proven.
Is that debate at all the higgs?

942
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,510
Because I remember there was some people
that were debating whether or not the 

943
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,010
higgs boson bows on the.
There's a new,

944
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:46,080
the analytical data that we've 
discovered and it has all the right 

945
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,250
properties to be the.
The predicted standard model higgs,

946
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,990
politically,
please explain what that means.

947
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,390
Political.
It was predicted back in the sixties.

948
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,720
My pizza higgs,
this man,

949
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:54,720
his name,
and it's a.

950
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,190
The idea is basically the early on in 
the expansion history of the universe,

951
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,170
so let's say less than a billionth of a 
second,

952
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,930
after the big bang as the universe 
cooled,

953
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:07,680
it went through something condensed out 
into empty space.

954
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,790
So if people call a phase transition 
over,

955
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,910
but it's analogous to a window pane on a
cold winter's day.

956
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:17,911
Die of cold winter days in la dia.
but if you were to get ice on a window,

957
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,880
it's analogous to say,
well,

958
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:24,630
it's a vapor condensing it into ice.
As you drop the temperature changes into

959
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:29,631
something else to into eyes.
So in the same way that the theory is 

960
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:30,400
that as the universe cooled,
something condensed

961
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,990
out,
so empty space isn't empty.

962
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,900
It's full of higgs particles,
if you like,

963
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,000
or a higgs field.
So every bit.

964
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:42,001
So this means this space now,
not just space between the galaxies in 

965
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:44,941
this room that every square meter over 
this room is full of the higgs field.

966
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,670
And our fundamental particles,
the electrons,

967
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:53,671
let's say in our bodies,
interact with that higgs field and in 

968
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:54,750
that process they acquire mass.
So it's the,

969
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:59,530
it's the mass generation mechanism is 
why some particles are massive,

970
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,520
like electrons and quarks and some 
things like photons are not massive.

971
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,430
They're massless and then travel through
the universe at the speed of light.

972
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,940
So that's the theory now that was 
suggested and built a mathematically 

973
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:14,920
essentially there's early evidence for 
it at the time back in the sixties,

974
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,590
but over the years,
uh,

975
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,300
the theory called the standard model of 
particle physics,

976
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:21,040
past all experimental tests.

977
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,990
So we got to the point where we thought,
right,

978
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:25,240
okay,
we will build a machine that will either

979
00:48:25,241 --> 00:48:28,690
disprove or prove that theory and the 
lhc is such a machine.

980
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,760
If that theory is correct,
which now seems to be it,

981
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,830
the prediction is you must find the 
higgs particle at the lhc or some kind 

982
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:40,540
of higgs particle.
And indeed we found it.

983
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,790
We,
as far as we can tell.

984
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:44,470
So that means that we found a new 
particle.

985
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:49,471
It has the right mass as predicted in 
the window that was predicted by the 

986
00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:53,071
theory.
It behaves in every way the theory 

987
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:55,621
Predicts.
So now what we have to do is be 

988
00:48:55,621 --> 00:48:56,890
experimental physicists.
So the alex turns back on again in about

989
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,310
a month actually,
so it's been upgraded,

990
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,400
it's been fixed and it's done.
It's maintenance.

991
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,430
So we're going to make more higgs 
particles now and that means we can make

992
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:08,431
more precision measurements and find out
whether it is the particle predicted by 

993
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:11,020
peter higgs or maybe it's one of a 
number of particles,

994
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:14,170
just possibly likely not now,
but it might be.

995
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,940
So it might be five of them,
for example,

996
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,330
which would suggest that theories called
supersymmetric theories are right.

997
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,540
So.
So we need to know exactly which 

998
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,090
precisely had the thing behaves,
which is why we have more work to do,

999
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,360
but it looks like it's very sure,
very sure that it is a higgs particle 

1000
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:35,941
that you can just,
you can mess around and build isa 

1001
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:37,540
terrick theories that get around it,
but there is a new particle there.

1002
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,970
There's no doubt about that.
And it looks like one of these things,

1003
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,180
but that's the remarkable thing.
I think about it because it was wagner 

1004
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,750
when a great physicist wrote an essay 
back in the sixties,

1005
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,751
I think called the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics and the 

1006
00:49:51,751 --> 00:49:54,841
physical sciences and the unreasonable 
effectiveness is demonstrated by this 

1007
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:59,061
discovery because it really is a 
mathematical prediction is we think 

1008
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:00,820
there's a new fundamental particle that 
does the job of giving math to the other

1009
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:05,850
particles and this is how it does it and
this is how it behaves and this is what 

1010
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:06,430
it will look like and this is what it 
will do.

1011
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:11,910
And then 50 years later you build the 
biggest machine ever built 60 miles into

1012
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:14,650
conference.
Most of it's in France,

1013
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:16,900
a bit of it's in Switzerland,
tense scientists,

1014
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,930
hundred and 50 countries.
You,

1015
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:23,931
you accelerate.
Protons are the nuclei of hydrogen 

1016
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:23,931
around this thing at 99 point nine,
nine,

1017
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:23,931
nine,
nine,

1018
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:24,490
nine,
nine percent.

1019
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:29,491
The speed of light,
they go around the 16 miles thousand 

1020
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,010
times a second.
We can collide $600,

1021
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:35,011
million of them together every second to
recreate the conditions that were 

1022
00:50:35,011 --> 00:50:38,201
present less than a billionth of a 
second after the universe began 

1023
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,200
photographing in the big east digital 
cameras ever built.

1024
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:42,620
The one I Work on called atlas is 40,
40 meters in diameter,

1025
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,190
vast vast thing,
7,000

1026
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:51,191
tons of digital camera in a cabin beside
st paul's cathedral underneath the 

1027
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:56,651
ground in Switzerland and you find it,
you find this guy,

1028
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,710
but he's a higgs working with many of 
the people predicted to exist 50 years 

1029
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,100
ago because he did some sums and so it's
a real.

1030
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,410
It's real.
So the universe does behave like that.

1031
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,310
There is a condensate in the vacuum.
It is a higgs condensate.

1032
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,590
It does give mass to do the particles.
So it's a tremendous testament to the 

1033
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,720
power of human reasoning,
I think,

1034
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:20,840
and it means that we understand physics.
It means that we.

1035
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,560
That's one of the important things about
it.

1036
00:51:22,561 --> 00:51:25,370
It means that our,
our understanding of fundamental physics

1037
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,980
is not horribly wrong at the moment.
It's,

1038
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,010
it's,
it's good enough to predict something 

1039
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,831
like that,
which is a remarkable achievement that 

1040
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:35,831
is mind blowing.
that is truly,

1041
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,910
truly mind blowing.
Do you know when peter higgs?

1042
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:42,911
Actually,
so the day that the discovery was 

1043
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:45,431
announced at cern,
packed auditorium and peter was there 

1044
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:47,360
and a journalist went up to him 
afterwards and just what I've said,

1045
00:51:47,361 --> 00:51:52,361
this is what happened.
This machine did a family thing and 

1046
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:52,361
said,
how do you feel?

1047
00:51:52,361 --> 00:51:52,400
Professor hagen?
And he said,

1048
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,590
it's very nice to be right.
Sometimes

1049
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:02,050
really understated british and yes he 
is.

1050
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,090
There you go.
That's exactly how a cup of tea american

1051
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:13,160
would show up with a fur coat on 
diamonds around his glasses.

1052
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:15,500
We have a big pimp cane and then someone
had come up,

1053
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:21,010
have given the nobel prize to beyonce 
because that'd be grammys last night,

1054
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,530
wasn't it?
Was it was.

1055
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:29,390
It was.
It was in Kenya.

1056
00:52:29,391 --> 00:52:31,250
West wasn't.
It keeps jumping on stage.

1057
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,800
Well,
he jumped on stage once,

1058
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,930
right?
He didn't do it again last night.

1059
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:36,550
Did he?
Apparently,

1060
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,040
ginny almost have it go.
He said,

1061
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:45,490
I can't be bothered,
so I just keep thinking part of the 

1062
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:45,690
problem.
You just want to talk about kanye west,

1063
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,550
the middle of the.
One of the last discussions I called the

1064
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:54,500
other guy jay zed called z zed.
That's a british thing.

1065
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:59,270
People don't know like a zero.
Six is a type of corvette.

1066
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,510
They call it zedo six.
So jason was copy of the large hadron 

1067
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:11,360
collider also figured out or or proved 
proved cork.

1068
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,060
Gluon plasma.
Yeah,

1069
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:14,930
so that is explain that the

1070
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:19,930
universe in the history of the universe,
so so way after the higgs mechanism 

1071
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,240
kicks in,
you get an.

1072
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,890
You have a period when it's still too 
hot for protons and neutrons to form the

1073
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:28,440
building blocks of atomic nuclei or 
protons and neutrons day.

1074
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:33,510
So a proton is made of two up quarks.
Quarks and a damn clock and a neutron is

1075
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:36,240
made a $2 and then up and then some of 
the stuff in there,

1076
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:40,190
glue gluons and things like that,
but what the universe was winter aphasia

1077
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:45,230
and it was too hot for that to happen.
so you get this plasmid is see of the 

1078
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:49,461
free quarks and gluons and all these 
things just before it gets cold enough 

1079
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:53,571
to condense into protons and neutrons 
and we investigate that by colliding a 

1080
00:53:53,571 --> 00:53:58,490
heavier things in protons together at 
the lhc so we can do silver atoms or a 

1081
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,380
silver nuclei or lead nuclei and things 
like that.

1082
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:06,410
The lhc can do that and it produces this
fat a millionth of a second after the 

1083
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:06,660
big bang.
So quite a long time.

1084
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:12,050
Quite a bit.
This is a lot has happened in that 

1085
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,991
relatively.
So we can do that as well and see how 

1086
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:17,511
that phase of the universe behaved and 
that stuff is supposed to be just 

1087
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,620
immeasurably heavy.
Right?

1088
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,540
oh,
the atomic nuclei.

1089
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

1090
00:54:22,141 --> 00:54:27,141
I mean if you look at.
So it astrophysical example would be a 

1091
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:28,650
neutron star,
which is basically a big nucleus,

1092
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,680
nuclear dense material.
The end point of a collapse star when 

1093
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,220
it's run out of fuel,
maybe it's not too big.

1094
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,900
It's too big.
It'll turn into a black hole.

1095
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:41,700
So neutron star would be a one and a 
half times the mass of the sun.

1096
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:45,510
Let's say something like that,
but it will be a radius of 10 miles,

1097
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,620
so it would easily fit in the la 
metropolitan area.

1098
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,800
Right.
But it would have the mass of the sub or

1099
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:56,400
greater.
So that's an atomic nucleus density.

1100
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,700
That's how you can imagine it.
Something as massive as some compressing

1101
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:03,690
something 10 miles across and we see 
these things all over the years.

1102
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,710
Neutron stars are fascinating things.

1103
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:13,310
Someone online was explaining it.
Some physicists was explaining that if 

1104
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,691
you had this court glue on plasma and it
was the size of a sugar cube,

1105
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,140
it was some ungodly amount of weight.
Yeah.

1106
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,740
like he couldn't even imagine it.
You know,

1107
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,100
mount everest,
you know,

1108
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:31,101
that kind of who'd be like mount everest
can't quite enormous broke my brain,

1109
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,320
be thinking about all our lady to 
earlier all the mess our mass is in the 

1110
00:55:39,841 --> 00:55:44,841
nuclei and if you've got all our nuclei 
mining your nuclei and stuffed them 

1111
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,480
together into that density that,
you know,

1112
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,490
it would be a grain of sand or something
less.

1113
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,000
So you could.
I mean,

1114
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:58,001
you think about the unit,
I mean the modern theories of the big 

1115
00:55:58,001 --> 00:55:59,130
bang it talked about earlier,
these inflationary cosmology theories,

1116
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,860
those suggest that the entire observable
universe,

1117
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:04,530
which has now got $350 billion galaxies 
in it,

1118
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,660
was some point the size of a,
I dunno,

1119
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:12,670
a baseball or less so,
so we imagine that we speak of in,

1120
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:18,031
in modern physics,
we have theories to address the time 

1121
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:20,430
when the entire observable universe was 
something that you could hold,

1122
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:22,910
so you've got enough energy in there to 
make $350,

1123
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:28,290
galaxies each with 200 billion stars and
it's remarkable that we're not quite 

1124
00:56:28,841 --> 00:56:31,130
there with the laws of physics,
but we're not far that.

1125
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,270
Those are the kind of.
That's the physics we're doing at lhc.

1126
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,630
Basically.
We're trying to explore the laws of 

1127
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,761
nature and seat,
find the laws of nature will describe 

1128
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:43,530
the universe when it was that hot and 
that dense and we are quite close.

1129
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:48,550
I say we were good from about a 
billionth of a second after the big 

1130
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,751
bang.
Then that's where we have our theories 

1131
00:56:51,751 --> 00:56:51,751
that talk about the higgs boson and 
things,

1132
00:56:51,751 --> 00:56:52,870
and so we understand that very well.
Um,

1133
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:53,400
so the,
the,

1134
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:56,560
the challenge now is to get back beyond 
that and that's where you,

1135
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,900
that's where string theory attempts to 
live,

1136
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,970
which you mentioned earlier string 
theory.

1137
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:03,480
We don't know if it's right.
We have no evidence to that.

1138
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:08,170
That is an approach to trying to 
describe the universe before,

1139
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,500
uh,
those times when our current laws work,

1140
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:15,500
the idea of a birth and a death of a 
universe trouble.

1141
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:20,501
Some people,
the idea that we have sort of 

1142
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:23,591
artificially subscribed the idea that 
this had to start somewhere and that it 

1143
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:27,971
may very well be an infinite expansion 
and contraction like waves going in 

1144
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:32,950
waves going out.
The idea being that the entire universe 

1145
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,341
may one day get to a point where it 
pulls down into itself and becomes one 

1146
00:57:37,131 --> 00:57:42,131
event.
Horizon one infinite peace of mass and 

1147
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,880
then starts all over again.
Is that possible?

1148
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,890
The current,
if you look at the,

1149
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:51,190
how the universe is expanding at the 
moment than it is accelerating in its 

1150
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,721
expansion.
So the measurements tell us that the 

1151
00:57:55,721 --> 00:57:57,530
expansion rate itself is getting faster 
and uh,

1152
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,010
we have,
uh,

1153
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:01,880
a name for that and we call it dark 
energy.

1154
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:07,150
And so the of older 65,
70 percent of the energy in the universe

1155
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,940
appears to be taken up in,
in driving this increasingly fast 

1156
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,351
expansion.
And so that looks like if nothing 

1157
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:17,351
happens,
then that becomes dominant.

1158
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:17,650
So,
so,

1159
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,170
so it continues to accelerate and 
expansion.

1160
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,280
And in the end you get something that 
looks like this inflationary period that

1161
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,170
I said may,
may have existed before the universe was

1162
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,910
hot and dense.
So it looks like.

1163
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:31,070
So that looks like what's happening at 
the moment.

1164
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,400
So whether that can stop where,
whether there's something that can stop 

1165
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,210
it in the same way as it seems to have 
stopped very early in the history by the

1166
00:58:38,211 --> 00:58:39,830
way.
And whether that's true,

1167
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,930
nobody knows,
we don't know the mechanism,

1168
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:45,170
but the measurements tellers have 
distant.

1169
00:58:45,171 --> 00:58:48,170
Particularly looking at supernova in 
distant galaxies.

1170
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,230
And also actually from this cosmic 
microwave background radiation.

1171
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:56,231
I mentioned earlier that the detailed 
modeling and measurements of that old 

1172
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:58,400
consistent and that the university is 
accelerating in its expansion,

1173
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:03,670
so that would suggest that it's not 
going to rebound because it's 

1174
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:07,030
everything.
It's like a big rip scenario almost 

1175
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:10,211
where everything's accelerated.
That space time is stretching it a 

1176
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:12,470
faster and faster rate at the moment.
That seems to be what's happening,

1177
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:17,900
so you feel that it's much more likely 
that there are infinite numbers of these

1178
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:25,161
things happening,
that there's not just one big bang that 

1179
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,750
creates this universe and we're watching
this universe expand,

1180
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,930
but that there's infinite numbers of 
these things that are happening at the 

1181
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:32,870
exact same time.
That said,

1182
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,160
that's most speculative,
so,

1183
00:59:35,161 --> 00:59:39,810
so the waY that the inflation is 
probably textbook.

1184
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,780
Now you got some physicists that will 
argue with it,

1185
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:47,781
but broadly speaking,
I think many astrophysicists think the 

1186
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:51,621
inflation is the best theory we have 
because it makes predictions that agree 

1187
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:51,621
with observation.
So it's.

1188
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:56,541
It's the best theory in terms of making 
the best predictions at the moment in 

1189
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,350
this is that exact suggested expansion.
Very fast,

1190
00:59:58,351 --> 01:00:00,450
super luminal faster than light 
expansion.

1191
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:05,690
That stops and the end point of that is 
what we used to call the Big bang and 

1192
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,740
so,
so that's broadly speaking,

1193
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:13,290
textbook stuff.
That's what you teach and undergraduate 

1194
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:15,741
Cosmology causes that.
Then some physicists argue that the 

1195
01:00:16,021 --> 01:00:19,950
natural extension to those theories,
the theories called eternal inflation,

1196
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:22,030
which are what you said where you said 
this,

1197
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,390
this,
this exponential expansion of space time

1198
01:00:24,391 --> 01:00:29,391
is always going on and it stopped just 
in little patches and that little patch 

1199
01:00:29,391 --> 01:00:33,210
is where you generate a new pocKet 
universe if you like,

1200
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:38,300
of which ours is one example,
and you can have an infinite number of 

1201
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,451
those and they were being that they 
would be being produced now and you can 

1202
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,570
asK the question,
how long has that been going on?

1203
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:48,020
And the answer is nobody knows,
and there's a debate even amongst the 

1204
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,681
people who believe in those theories 
about whether it could have gone on 

1205
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,220
forever or whether it would have started
in what a colleague of mine at durham,

1206
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,530
carlos frank calls the mother of all big
bangs.

1207
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,280
So was the mother of all bIg bangs that 
set this process in motion.

1208
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,340
And in that thing that got said,
that big fractal thing,

1209
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:07,360
you get loads of little bit guys,
and the answer is this is cutting edge 

1210
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:07,680
stuff.
It's very exciting.

1211
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,700
Um,
but so,

1212
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,480
so I'd say just to be very precise,
the inflationary bit,

1213
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:17,700
the simple bits which was first put 
forward in the eighties actually by alan

1214
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,610
guth and people like that in the us and 
andre,

1215
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:25,620
linda,
another one that looks right in the 

1216
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,131
sense that it matches data very well and
the consequences of it are argued about 

1217
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:29,880
an interactive areas of research at the 
moment.

1218
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,620
One of the things that

1219
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,840
people were terrified of about the large
hadron collider is that in trying to 

1220
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,130
find the higgs that you might 
accidentally create black holes,

1221
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:45,380
little tiny one,
so it would just go eat and through the 

1222
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:45,380
earth,
like a,

1223
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,331
like a little ping pong ball that's shot
through the entire planet that that's 

1224
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:51,040
idiots like me that thought that,
holy shit,

1225
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,280
is it possible to create a big bang or 
excuse me,

1226
01:01:57,281 --> 01:01:58,210
a black hole?
Is that,

1227
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:00,790
is it possible theoretically to have 
enough power?

1228
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:03,610
Like if you don't have it right now with
the large hadron collider,

1229
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:08,760
is it possible that a larger machine 
will be created and human beings can 

1230
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,580
recreate a black hole?

1231
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,600
Yes,
it's possible.

1232
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:16,660
And it's possible if You have extra 
dimensions in the universe.

1233
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,410
Right?
So the thing is that,

1234
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:24,470
so we need gravity's.
A very weak force is by far the weakest 

1235
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:27,861
of the four fundamental forces of nature
be billions and billions of times a 

1236
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:27,861
week.
And the other ones,

1237
01:02:27,861 --> 01:02:29,730
which you can tell because you can pick 
up your phone,

1238
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:34,790
even though the planet,
planet earth is trying to stop me doing 

1239
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,671
that,
and I can just resist the pull of 

1240
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:37,671
planet.
So gravity is very weak.

1241
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,490
So that gives you a clue that you can 
say,

1242
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:40,980
well,
what energy?

1243
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,230
How far do I have to go back in time?
If you like,

1244
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,580
towards the big bang before it's so hot 
that the,

1245
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,870
that gravity is as strong as the other 
forces.

1246
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:50,910
The strength of the force is varies,
I should say,

1247
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:51,300
with,
with,

1248
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,930
with energy.
So they changed so that.

1249
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:57,660
And we've seen this behavior,
so so two of the forces,

1250
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:02,690
so-called electromagnetism,
which is the most familiar on 

1251
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:03,390
electricity,
that one a and the weak nuclear force,

1252
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,880
which is one of the forces that operates
in the atomic nucleus.

1253
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:11,150
They are the same force.
They're manifestations of the same 

1254
01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:11,150
force,
and we've seen this experimentally,

1255
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,890
and in fact the higgs boson is part of 
that process.

1256
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:17,610
And so we've seen the energies that they
become the same force.

1257
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,120
So the idea is the other force,
the strong nuclear force,

1258
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:25,210
if you go to higher energies and 
temperatures convergys and they'd have 

1259
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:25,350
some things called grand unified 
theories,

1260
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:28,570
and then gravity makes it a lethargic 
way back and,

1261
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:31,440
and unifies with them.
It's something called the planck energy,

1262
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,220
which is immense.
The short timescales after the origin of

1263
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:37,050
the universe have you on so very,
very hot,

1264
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,150
so,
so way in excess of anything.

1265
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,200
So if you just want to just create black
holes in a lab,

1266
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,440
then the nike thing is you'd have to go 
to those energies and there's nowhere in

1267
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:47,560
the universe.
You'd never do it.

1268
01:03:47,561 --> 01:03:50,100
So you'd have a part accelerated the 
side of the observable universe and they

1269
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:55,101
wouldn't be big enough,
but if you allow extra dimensions in 

1270
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:59,991
space,
so you might imagine that we will live 

1271
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:02,601
in a three dimensional space and then 
there's time as well as four dimensions 

1272
01:04:02,601 --> 01:04:06,170
if you allow it to be five or six or 30.
Nothing to string theory that they keep 

1273
01:04:06,811 --> 01:04:09,480
changing their mind,
but there's 13 now,

1274
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:14,870
something like that,
and then what you can do is you can 

1275
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:19,890
arrange for that energy scale at which 
gravity becomes important to to,

1276
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:24,930
to to come up.
So the temperatures to drop so you can 

1277
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,460
arraign.
You can arrange in some contrived way to

1278
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:30,120
get to the point where you could 
possibly access gravity,

1279
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,120
see gravity in action as it were in 
particle accelerators,

1280
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:38,500
at things as big as the lhc,
and in that case you would produce we 

1281
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,300
little black holes,
which would then evaporate away very 

1282
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:44,300
quickly.

1283
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:45,420
We think through a process called 
hawking radiation and they be.

1284
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:50,421
They began.
So you can conceive of a way that you 

1285
01:04:50,421 --> 01:04:51,900
could,
if given a big of a leap,

1286
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,930
that there are extra dimensions in the 
universe and given that they're 

1287
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,391
configured in the right way,
that you can imagine that you could do 

1288
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,391
it.
The the.

1289
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:02,370
The interesting point though is that so 
lhc is,

1290
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:04,710
is it's a tremendous technological 
achievement,

1291
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:10,190
but it collides particles together,
energies that are just insignificant 

1292
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,600
compared to the energies that are 
available in the universe to nature.

1293
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:14,880
So cosmic rays,
for example,

1294
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,870
hit the earth with energies far in 
excess of those that we generated,

1295
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:23,890
lhc.
So whatever physics she can conceivably 

1296
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:27,511
access of these parcels,
accelerators is already been access now 

1297
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:31,620
in the upper atmosphere of the planet 
because the cosmic ray collisions are 

1298
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:35,101
immensely higher energy.
So so you can make little black holes 

1299
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,730
because they're extra dimensions in the 
universe.

1300
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:40,210
Then they are raining down on us.
Now they're here.

1301
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,570
They get made because the,
the energies of the lhc is,

1302
01:05:43,571 --> 01:05:48,571
I said,
astrophysical processes all over the 

1303
01:05:48,571 --> 01:05:49,210
universe,
way in excess way exceed those energies.

1304
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,690
We were not very good at doing high 
energy collisions compared to nature.

1305
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:58,070
That's a supernova,
explosions and compared to all the and 

1306
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,110
cosmic rays because it cosmic ray 
actually that was detected,

1307
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:04,111
I think the highest energy one was the 
had the energy of a professional tennis 

1308
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:06,700
player serve so hundred mile an hour 
tennis ball.

1309
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,860
Right?
And it's a single particle.

1310
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,280
So imagine getting hit by a hundred mile
an hour.

1311
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:14,650
Professional tennis players serve on the
back of their head,

1312
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:20,060
their cosmic rays with that energy.
But the one particle of would be equal 

1313
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:25,270
to 100 miles an hour tennis ball.
So these are credible energies.

1314
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,420
Way beyond any how many particles would 
be in a tennis ball.

1315
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:30,010
Oh,
it's a good question.

1316
01:06:30,011 --> 01:06:32,080
That.
So let's do some sort of thing.

1317
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,070
So,
so I have a gander.

1318
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:36,850
Rose number is what is it?
Six times 10 to the 23,

1319
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:37,810
isn't it?
That's right.

1320
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,870
So that,
that's the number of particles in the 

1321
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:44,350
number of atoms,
let's say in 12 grams of carbon.

1322
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:49,570
So it solved the old of.
So tends to the 23.

1323
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:53,980
Is it 10 to 24 is a million million,
million million,

1324
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,470
right?
So that.

1325
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,920
So a million,
million,

1326
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:01,920
million,
million particles would be what you'd 

1327
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,511
have in atoms or carbon you'd have in a.
You find me on the spot here on you if 

1328
01:07:03,511 --> 01:07:06,190
that's what you'd have in about what?
Sixty,

1329
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,500
60 grams of carbon or something like 
that.

1330
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,660
So you've asked to guess.
I'd say something like that.

1331
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:17,020
And that's chemistry.
See I don't do chemistry,

1332
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:22,170
but that's out there.
Just floating around and we got rid of 

1333
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:22,170
the galaxy.
Like when a hyper nova,

1334
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,030
you still trying to do the math made?
Sure.

1335
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,840
Because we live on the web.
I don't want to get it right.

1336
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,690
I get older.
people do that all the time.

1337
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:33,691
The show's all about wrong answers.
You're just talking.

1338
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:37,000
It's not your field of study.
I understand,

1339
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,530
but it should be really,
really good.

1340
01:07:38,531 --> 01:07:43,010
Chemistry.
I think chemistry or physics,

1341
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:46,220
but bigger blogs.
I've watched a documentary once on hyper

1342
01:07:46,221 --> 01:07:51,221
novas that when they were first 
discovering the gamma burst in the 

1343
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:54,031
galaxy,
they thought it was aliens having wars 

1344
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:54,031
with each other.
That was one of the.

1345
01:07:54,031 --> 01:07:55,630
One of the ideas that were being bandied
about.

1346
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,410
Great.
I mean,

1347
01:07:56,411 --> 01:08:01,180
people do legitimately look for 
signatures from alien civilizations like

1348
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,170
that sort of.

1349
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,890
Yeah,
But it's kinda mad people who do it,

1350
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,490
but they're actually,
you can do.

1351
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,520
There are papers written about because 
you might say what would the signature 

1352
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,060
of a,
of an interstellar star looked like?

1353
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:16,400
Presumably be a matter and antimatter 
drive or something like that.

1354
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:21,610
So you get these very Clear signatures 
of matter and antimatter annihilation 

1355
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:23,540
that we know about because we do that,
that particular photons,

1356
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:26,570
gamma rays with particular energies and 
so you can,

1357
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,460
you can actually say,
well shall we have a look?

1358
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:32,930
What would it look like if we saw an 
interstellar civilization and interspace

1359
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:35,150
fair in civilization?
Could we detect the signatures?

1360
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,420
So there's a bit of work done on that 
and we don't see any.

1361
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:40,030
We don't see any evidence for anything.
Well,

1362
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:45,050
when you see someone like the people 
that run seti search for 

1363
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:48,011
extraterrestrial intelligence and 
they're always like asking for funding 

1364
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:48,011
and like,
you know,

1365
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:48,011
we need more funding.

1366
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:49,070
We have to figure this out.
and one day,

1367
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,970
what if we shut down?
And then the signal comes like,

1368
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,990
that seems to me to be like one of the 
biggest,

1369
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:58,991
like hail mary wishes,
like hoping that you're going to find a 

1370
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:01,880
radio signal from a galaxy far,
far away that has intelligent life.

1371
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:02,960
I mean our galaxy.
Well,

1372
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:04,850
it's interesting though that if you ask 
astronomers,

1373
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,060
so you say what's the probability of 
civilization has been out there.

1374
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,650
Then they will point,
for example,

1375
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:14,651
to the new data from the capitalist 
space telescope which tells us that 

1376
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,371
there are probably around 20 billion 
earth like planets in the milky way 

1377
01:09:18,371 --> 01:09:23,291
galaxy in the sense that they're small 
rocky planets in what's called the 

1378
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,370
habitable zone around stars.
The goldIlocks main sequence.

1379
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:27,410
Stars like the earth,
like the sun.

1380
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:28,670
So,
so 20 billion.

1381
01:09:28,671 --> 01:09:33,671
So maybe one in 10 stars in the sky has 
an earth like planets around it 

1382
01:09:34,401 --> 01:09:35,090
potentially.

1383
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:37,950
So that's a lot.
So you think 20 billion devices,

1384
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:40,760
surely life must have a on on some of 
those.

1385
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,040
The answer is probably yes.
I suspect.

1386
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,230
I suspect we'll,
we'll,

1387
01:09:44,231 --> 01:09:46,310
we may find life on mars in the next 10 
years,

1388
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:48,860
but it will be microbes.
So the question then becomes,

1389
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:53,861
well,
how likely is it for simple life if it 

1390
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:54,860
arises to make its way into a 
civilization?

1391
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,520
And that's where the biologists come in 
and kind of calm the astronomers down 

1392
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:00,520
and say,
well,

1393
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,260
you might think there are lots of places
for life we would agree,

1394
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:08,740
but on earth it took three point 8 
billion years to go from the origin of 

1395
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:13,010
life to a civilization which is about a 
third of the age of the universe,

1396
01:10:13,011 --> 01:10:15,740
give or take.
So you had to have an unbroken,

1397
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,420
stable line of life.
the,

1398
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,980
the,
the,

1399
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:19,700
that,
that,

1400
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:21,620
um,
that evolves in the,

1401
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,360
in the right way as it were to.

1402
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,340
So first of all,
it gets complex.

1403
01:10:25,341 --> 01:10:25,790
I mean,
it took.

1404
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:31,340
There's a thing called the cambrian 
explosion in the history of life on 

1405
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:32,480
earth,
which was about 550 million years ago or

1406
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:34,310
so,
we sounds like a long time.

1407
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,880
But for 3 billion years before that,
there was nothing that we would Call 

1408
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,220
complex single celled organisms doing 
some clever Stuff like photosynthesis,

1409
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,400
but not much.
and then suddenly you get a big jump in 

1410
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,370
the oxygen content.
Of the atmosphere on earth,

1411
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:53,930
which was to do with photosynthesis and 
some geology in play with it.

1412
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:59,230
That's how the oxygen gets into the 
atmosphere and then you get a big jump 

1413
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:01,280
and you get complex life emerging and 
then pretty quickly,

1414
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,200
you know,
half a billion years or so,

1415
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:06,470
you go from complex things to to 
civilization.

1416
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:09,190
But even then you think about homo 
sapien.

1417
01:11:09,191 --> 01:11:11,540
As we mentioneD earlier,
they only arose 200,000

1418
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:12,020
years ago.

1419
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:17,620
So for,
for the vast majority of the history of 

1420
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,331
life on earth,
that has been nothing that could do 

1421
01:11:20,331 --> 01:11:20,820
anything clever in the sense of 
thinking,

1422
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,100
building spacecraft and radio 
telescopes.

1423
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:28,420
So,
so does it really legitimate debate 

1424
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,800
about whether the undoubted increase in.
We know now that there are homes for 

1425
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:33,540
life out there in the milky way.
They're very common.

1426
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:38,650
We know that,
but we don't know is the probability 

1427
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:39,690
that life will emerge in the first 
place.

1428
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,000
And secondly,
the probabIlity that will be turned into

1429
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:44,190
a civilization.
And I think that's very low.

1430
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,710
So I think like I think the ability,
if I guessed,

1431
01:11:46,711 --> 01:11:51,711
I would say the probability that life 
will emerge given the right conditions 

1432
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:54,831
is very high and what one piece of 
evidence you could put forward to that 

1433
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:59,181
is that it did appear to emerge on earth
as soon as he could after the formation 

1434
01:11:59,181 --> 01:11:59,220
of the earth and the oceans.

1435
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,940
So you get life.
But then it took a long time on earth.

1436
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:04,060
So you mIght say,
well the,

1437
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:09,540
you know,
the provost of it doing anything 

1438
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:09,540
intelligent and interesting,
quite low,

1439
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,130
maybe less than one in 20 billion,
in which case you.

1440
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:14,850
We ended up being the only civilization 
in the milky way at the moment.

1441
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,960
It is possible.
You can make the argument and my 

1442
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,541
experience is academic biologists tend 
to be on the cautious side and an 

1443
01:12:23,541 --> 01:12:24,780
astronomist tend to be on the optimistic
side.

1444
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:27,030
It's all relative though,
isn't it?

1445
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:32,031
Because even if we are only one out of 
this entire milky way galaxy,

1446
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:37,790
you still believe that it's possible for
an infinite number of monkeys to create 

1447
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:39,610
the works of shakespeare.
So really look at the entire.

1448
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,190
Yeah,
because they have to.

1449
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:47,510
We did that with remember,
but if you look at the entire universe 

1450
01:12:47,611 --> 01:12:52,611
than the idea of there being not just a 
life form like human beings,

1451
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:58,611
but the exact same life form is not just
once but an infinite number of times in 

1452
01:12:58,921 --> 01:12:59,400
the universe.

1453
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,630
That's the universe.
I'm sure.

1454
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:03,660
I mean there are 350 billion galaxies in
the observable universe,

1455
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:08,661
so it would be surely there are 
civilizations out there and more 

1456
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:08,661
advanced as well.
Yeah,

1457
01:13:08,661 --> 01:13:13,221
I'm sure.
I'm sure that's the shore and it has to 

1458
01:13:13,221 --> 01:13:13,221
be the case in an infinite universe as 
you say,

1459
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:15,480
but it confined ourselves to the milky 
way,

1460
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,840
which is really the only place we have 
any hope of exploring or contacting 

1461
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,760
anyone will never contacted anyone.
Even in the andromeda galaxy.

1462
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,490
Two point 2 million light years away,
but we won't.

1463
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:27,790
We won't,
but.

1464
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,150
But the milky way,
if there's someone there,

1465
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:33,060
we could at least aspire to contact 
them,

1466
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:37,470
so it's worth the effort to listen.
We don't spend much money on it.

1467
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:42,471
It's we're spending too little on the.
I think it would be a tremendous 

1468
01:13:42,471 --> 01:13:43,260
discovery if we made it as far as 
something like that.

1469
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:48,290
It's worth listening because you know,
when he started back with Frank Drake 

1470
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:48,960
and carl sagan and others back in the 
sixties,

1471
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:54,290
then they are.
No planets have been discovered beyond 

1472
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:54,290
the,
beyond the solar system numb.

1473
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,830
So you the only planet we knew our 
planets now,

1474
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,950
as I said,
we've discovered thousands of planets 

1475
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:07,280
confirm discoveries and the statistics 
tell you there are billions of them out 

1476
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:12,921
there.
So virtually every style probably has a 

1477
01:14:12,921 --> 01:14:12,921
planetary system.
So,

1478
01:14:12,921 --> 01:14:13,930
so the,
the statistics have gone in the favor of

1479
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:17,050
seti from the astronomical perspective.
But as I say,

1480
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:21,400
you've also got to have the time to make
things like us,

1481
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,200
uh,
you know,

1482
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,860
and that,
that's a torturous process.

1483
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:26,470
There's no inevitability to evolution.
I think it's not,

1484
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:27,030
it's not,
uh,

1485
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,440
uh,
not to be seen as some march to 

1486
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:32,440
complexity.
Evolution is,

1487
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:32,440
it's,
it,

1488
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,130
it,
it does.

1489
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:35,860
What it does is single celled organisms 
were very,

1490
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,400
very good at just surviving and getting 
on with it for,

1491
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:43,401
over,
for most of the history of life on 

1492
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:43,401
earth.

1493
01:14:43,401 --> 01:14:45,870
So it may be that complex,
multicellular life is kind of a just an 

1494
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:45,970
aberration,
really.

1495
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:50,971
It's just a bit of a lucky accident.
So it's all really just perspective when

1496
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:56,611
you think about it because there's,
even though there is enormous galaxy,

1497
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:02,220
relatively speaking,
it's one tiny on that big little thing 

1498
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,160
in comparison to the rest of the 
universe.

1499
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,030
So even if we could find something out 
there,

1500
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,600
the likelihood of it being as advanced 
as us are very small,

1501
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:14,320
but it's just a matter of how far we can
reach or how far we can see.

1502
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:17,690
I w I wouldn't go there.
NobodY knows it.

1503
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:22,880
The what,
what people do now I think is that the 

1504
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:23,920
milky way is probably the boundary of 
our aspirations.

1505
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:28,950
It's for this generation or forever.
I think so what if we live a 100,000

1506
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:35,311
years in public?
Keep the galaxies are hundred thousand 

1507
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:37,180
light years across the $200 million star
systems in it.

1508
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:40,140
It's big,
it's too big it.

1509
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,710
But that,
that's not.

1510
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:47,010
So you could just about perhaps conceive
in the far future of beginning to spread

1511
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:50,530
out into the milky way.
You could conceive of that,

1512
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,550
um,
it given hundreds thousands of years,

1513
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:56,800
right?
But then if you then you go,

1514
01:15:56,801 --> 01:16:01,801
well,
where's the next galaxy andromeda to 

1515
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:04,830
over 2 million light years away.
So the idea that you would get across a 

1516
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:08,881
distance of 2 million light years with 
any conceivable technology is to me 

1517
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:09,790
probably.
I mean,

1518
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:13,930
it takes light a light beam to 2 million
years.

1519
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:16,150
So if you want to talk to someone in 
andromeda,

1520
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:18,050
you,
it will take 200,

1521
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:23,150
2 million years to get a message out 
there and 2 million years to get it 

1522
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:23,910
back.
So there's a full million round trip.

1523
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,630
That's the nearest galaxy.
It's big,

1524
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,370
right?
It's big,

1525
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:33,870
but it's so,
so you can imagine possibly the milky 

1526
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:33,870
way.

1527
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:36,100
It's some chance if there are other 
civilizations there talking to them.

1528
01:16:36,610 --> 01:16:39,490
But I think beyond that,
I just cannot conceive of how it will be

1529
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:43,570
done.
Is this relative though a perspective to

1530
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:48,571
the single celled organisms that existed
billions of years ago in comparison to 

1531
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:52,321
us?
Do we really think that we're the end 

1532
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:52,321
all be all?
And this is the last stop on the road to

1533
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:56,821
evolution isn't impossible that we get 
so advanced if we lIve to be another 

1534
01:16:56,821 --> 01:17:00,460
billion years that we Can all these 
ideas that we have in oUr head about the

1535
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:02,690
laws of space and time and the,
the,

1536
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:07,691
the,
what particle physicists are trying to 

1537
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:10,040
figure out and what string theorists are
prescribing as far as,

1538
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:15,041
you know,
15 different dimensions that we just 

1539
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:16,750
send it to them.
I know that that's pretty unfair to 

1540
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:20,291
them,
but I want to get into that because I 

1541
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:20,291
don't understand string theory.

1542
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:20,291
No,
I don't know,

1543
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:23,610
but I understand what you're saying.
Either my.

1544
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:27,860
But my idea is that if we continue to go
on the same path,

1545
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:33,040
I mean isn't it possible that we will 
achieve some unfathomable level of 

1546
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:38,321
technological proficiency or have 
control over matter or have or have an 

1547
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:44,081
understanding of the universe.
It's such a deep level that we can 

1548
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,820
violate all these things that we now 
consider laws.

1549
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:48,170
Like the laws of.
Yeah.

1550
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,470
So the laws would have to be 
approximation as to some deeper laws.

1551
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,950
They're the einstein's theories of 
relativity.

1552
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,910
The best theories we have at the moment 
to have space and time,

1553
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:04,130
space time,
thank god for einstein and well it 

1554
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,020
wasn't general relativity actually 100 
years old this year.

1555
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:09,940
So that is,
it's amazing and I'm so the,

1556
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:15,020
the speed of light as a,
as a fundamental part of the structure 

1557
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:17,960
of space and time actually is central to
that theory.

1558
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,250
It's actually the thing that protects 
and cause and effect.

1559
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:27,460
So it protects if you like,
the past from the present and the 

1560
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:27,460
future.
So it,

1561
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,260
it's built in in a very fundamental way 
to that theory.

1562
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,100
So you are right,
it's in principle that.

1563
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:35,420
And it's a speed limit in that theory,
by the way.

1564
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,270
And by the way,
there are strange things happened as you

1565
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:39,920
approach the speed of light.
For example,

1566
01:18:39,921 --> 01:18:44,270
the theory says that time slows down 
thing that's traveling relative to us.

1567
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:49,390
So if someone there,
the number I know is the number for the 

1568
01:18:49,390 --> 01:18:50,150
protons in the lhc.
So the protons go 99 point nine,

1569
01:18:50,151 --> 01:18:50,630
nine,
nine,

1570
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:51,080
nine,
nine,

1571
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:53,190
nine percent.
The speed of light at that.

1572
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:58,300
So imagine one of those flying pastors 
now and you imagine it at a watch for 

1573
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,391
it,
suddenly the watch and you'd see it's 

1574
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:04,691
what past 7,000
times more slowly our watch it and it 

1575
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:06,860
would live 7,000
times more slowly than those.

1576
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,960
So conversely,
if it was watching us,

1577
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:09,650
um,
it,

1578
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:10,220
it,
it,

1579
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,430
that it would see the same effect.
So you can,

1580
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,330
so you can move through time at 
different rates,

1581
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:22,331
essentially united starting this theory 
that the faster you go relative to 

1582
01:19:22,331 --> 01:19:22,340
somebody else,
the slower your watch ticks.

1583
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:27,460
I got an idea.
We combine your world and the 

1584
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,240
kardashians and we shoot them in a space
of the speed of light and they don't age

1585
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:30,800
well.
That's exactly right.

1586
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:32,630
So exactly what you said.
The cool thing about.

1587
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:37,920
That's what I was going to say.
The thing about relativity is if you go 

1588
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:38,390
at the speed of light,
you don't age,

1589
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:43,220
no time passes.
And that kind of pointed.

1590
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,290
You can't go at the speed of light 
unless you're massless.

1591
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,760
But that's kind of tough.
But he'd be a message.

1592
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:52,770
You have to have you ever seen her ass?
Good luck making that thing massless 

1593
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:52,770
well,
exactly.

1594
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,430
It's so be limited to travel below the 
speed of light,

1595
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,920
not just you.
even if she only weighed only one gram 

1596
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,230
in mass,
she's such a lot more than that.

1597
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:06,080
Plus that's not a very aerodynamic 
object either.

1598
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,950
So we're launching that sucker.

1599
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:08,700
Oh,
that's right.

1600
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:10,530
It wouldn't matter in space because it's
a vacuum.

1601
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,150
So you're all right today.
We're dynamics still.

1602
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,640
So it's a fundamental thing.
So.

1603
01:20:16,641 --> 01:20:21,641
So if you,
if you're going at that fundamental 

1604
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:21,641
speed,
there's no time,

1605
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:26,180
there's no distance.
Actually there all the distances shrink 

1606
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:26,180
to zero.
So it's a,

1607
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:27,810
it's a long dress aids.
It's a fundamental part of the structure

1608
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:29,880
of space and time.
So it's always been possible.

1609
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,910
So you would need a different theory.
So it's literally impossible change 

1610
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:37,810
theory to go at the speed of light.
Unless you're massless engage,

1611
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,380
you have to go at the speed of light.
Ken,

1612
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,420
could you go just under the speed of 
light and then time would just slowed 

1613
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,750
down so it wouldn't,
you wouldn't,

1614
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:48,930
it wouldn't stop,
but it would slow drastically.

1615
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1616
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:51,200
So as I said,
99 point nine,

1617
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:51,570
nine,
nine,

1618
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:51,990
nine,
nine,

1619
01:20:51,991 --> 01:20:54,600
nine percent gives you a factor of 
7,000.

1620
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:59,870
Now here's the question,
if you somehow or another we're able to 

1621
01:20:59,870 --> 01:20:59,990
go 99 point nine,
nine,

1622
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:04,890
nine percent of the speed of light.
What would happen in your perspective as

1623
01:21:04,891 --> 01:21:07,140
far as time would?
Would time,

1624
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,400
normal rate and their normal rate.
Yeah.

1625
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,340
So you would age at a normal rate in 
your perspective?

1626
01:21:12,341 --> 01:21:14,310
Yes.
But back home,

1627
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:19,311
like if you came back around,
if you went out into space and you went 

1628
01:21:19,311 --> 01:21:19,890
10 years at the speed of light and you 
know,

1629
01:21:19,891 --> 01:21:20,910
you,
you came back,

1630
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:23,460
everything would change,
but you'd be exactly the same.

1631
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,130
Yes.
What would change for you though?

1632
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,800
Something has to change.
So if the distances.

1633
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:34,150
So if you travel.
So the other thing is let's talk about 

1634
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,300
the protons in the lhc again.
So they're their,

1635
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:40,301
they're their times past in 7,000
signs more slowly from the perspective 

1636
01:21:40,301 --> 01:21:41,370
of someone stood on the ground watching 
them go round,

1637
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:44,250
but from their perspective,
time's going at the same rate,

1638
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,870
but something must change.

1639
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:47,370
So what is it?
The distance.

1640
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:52,170
So the lhc is no longer 16 miles in 
circumference,

1641
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,030
it's about now I know the number in 
metric,

1642
01:21:55,031 --> 01:22:00,031
so it's four meters,
so that's what is that in three feet or 

1643
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:00,690
meters,
like three point zero feet.

1644
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,270
Twelve feet?
Yeah.

1645
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:06,760
So it's titled feet,
so it's squashes and so distance is 

1646
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,220
shrink from the perspective of the 
protons,

1647
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:12,660
so time passes at the same rate that the
normal rate for them for on their watch,

1648
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:17,280
but the distances seem to seem to shrink
or do shrink not seem to.

1649
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:22,340
They do deep.
Are you concerned at all about 

1650
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,720
artificial life?
Are you concerned at all about the 

1651
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:30,800
creation,
the inevitable creation of something 

1652
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:34,580
that in some way replicates independent 
thought and acts on its own accord?

1653
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:40,370
I always wonder if human beings are in 
some sort of a sense a technological 

1654
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:46,881
caterpillar that's becoming a butterfly 
and we just don't realize it in all of 

1655
01:22:46,881 --> 01:22:50,841
our work.
If you look at one of the things that 

1656
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:50,841
human beings are absolutely fascinated 
with,

1657
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:55,101
whether or not it benefits us or not,
we're fascinated with technological 

1658
01:22:55,101 --> 01:22:55,920
innovation.
What we want faster computers,

1659
01:22:55,921 --> 01:22:57,720
even if we don't even have applications 
for them,

1660
01:22:58,050 --> 01:23:00,450
we want cars that goes zero to 60 in two
seconds.

1661
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,800
We want everything to go quicker and 
better and we we,

1662
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:06,010
we don't get satisfied.
Nobody ever looks

1663
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,690
at computers and goes,
we're good,

1664
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,000
we're good.
We don't need a bigger laptop.

1665
01:23:10,001 --> 01:23:12,670
We don't need a stronger hard drive.
Everything seemed fine.

1666
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:16,700
Let's stop innovating on computers and 
move towards cancer research or no,

1667
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,430
we will never.
We're never going to stop.

1668
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:22,780
And I always wonder if what?
Whatever drives us.

1669
01:23:22,930 --> 01:23:27,930
What if,
what if is similar in some way to 

1670
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:31,350
caterpillar building a cocoon,
get about to give birth to this new 

1671
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,340
thing.
Totally unaware and that artificial life

1672
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:38,341
that our work with,
whether it's code or whether it's 

1673
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,210
electronics or whether it's three d 
printing,

1674
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,360
a combination of all those technologies 
coming together to create some new form 

1675
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:52,921
of life and we don't think of life being
possible in an electronic sense because 

1676
01:23:52,921 --> 01:23:57,901
we think of life as being cells and 
blood and all the things that we are,

1677
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:03,450
but is it possible that we might just be
building the next thing that you know,

1678
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,510
we look at,
well,

1679
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:06,520
we've only been alive for 200,000
years.

1680
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:11,790
Yeah,
but we might be shitting out the new 

1681
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:14,341
version of life with our constant 
fascination with materialism.

1682
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:17,290
I mean,
what is materialism ultimately,

1683
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:21,140
if not a push for innovation and 
technology?

1684
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:24,490
A big part of what materialism is,
is keeping up with the jones' is getting

1685
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:26,050
the latest and greatest.
Look at this.

1686
01:24:26,051 --> 01:24:29,830
This guy has got a new tv.
It sees your fucking brain.

1687
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:31,120
You know,
it looks through your soul.

1688
01:24:31,130 --> 01:24:33,330
You could play back your history.
You know it,

1689
01:24:33,331 --> 01:24:35,770
it gets a fingerprint it.
You read it,

1690
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:39,190
it takes your dna and it shows you what 
your ancestors were doing.

1691
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:40,690
Two billion years ago,
I mean,

1692
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,770
well there's another aspects

1693
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:46,770
of r and d besides consumerism,
isn't that the increased life 

1694
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:46,770
expectancy,
decreased child mortality,

1695
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,980
although of great things too.
But I agree with you.

1696
01:24:49,010 --> 01:24:54,010
I agree with you.
I don't see any reason why I'm ai is in 

1697
01:24:54,111 --> 01:24:59,111
principle not possible because I think 
that although you know the research,

1698
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:03,440
we don't understand the brain,
but I think it must,

1699
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:07,160
it must be an object that operates in 
accord with the laws of physics.

1700
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:07,840
He,
I,

1701
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:12,850
I,
I strongly suspect that our conscious 

1702
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:13,130
experience is emergent,
so it emerges.

1703
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:15,290
So there's a,
there's an algorithm there.

1704
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,510
Very complex algorithm,
but I don't see why it can't be 

1705
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:21,230
simulated in a sufficiently powerful 
computer in principle.

1706
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,260
So I don't see why you can't have a 
conscious competer.

1707
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:27,560
I don't personally see why you can't.
Therefore,

1708
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:30,950
if that's true,
then you can given them and as you say,

1709
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:31,420
the,
the,

1710
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:33,340
the rate of increase in computing power.

1711
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:35,270
Is it rapid?
We're not there yet.

1712
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:40,540
There is a project in,
in europe are very big project to build 

1713
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,210
a,
a brain simulator.

1714
01:25:41,390 --> 01:25:44,030
It's a long way off and you're talking 
about billions of dollars,

1715
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:45,740
but I'm at the moment,
you know,

1716
01:25:45,741 --> 01:25:49,790
as you say that 40 years ago,
a billion dollars when you vote,

1717
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:52,210
you have an iphone,
so.

1718
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,270
So yeah,
I,

1719
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:58,290
I agree with you,
and actually energy said three d 

1720
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:01,451
printers a essentially seem to be the 
first step on the road to self 

1721
01:26:01,451 --> 01:26:05,721
replicating machine.
So you've the computing power that can 

1722
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:07,970
be intelligent and you've got a means of
it being a replicator.

1723
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:11,600
Then I don't see why you can't build ais
that replicate.

1724
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:14,750
And actually going back to the cosmology
for a minute,

1725
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,410
one of the arguments against the 
existence of civilizations,

1726
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:24,430
more advanced civilizations,
the nose in the milky way is that they 

1727
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:24,430
would have done that.

1728
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:28,670
And this is an argument from a 
mathematician called paul nyman and also

1729
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:31,070
a physicist called fermi.
It's called the fermi paradox.

1730
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:34,260
That let's assume that let's,
let's fast forward a ge said,

1731
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,890
let's fastforward our civilization.
Ten thousand years,

1732
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,050
leT's say blink of an eye.
Let's see.

1733
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:44,170
We'Ve only been around for.
We've been around for less than that as 

1734
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:44,170
a civilization.
Let's aa 10,000.

1735
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:47,270
What are we going to look like?
Will we have built self replicating ais?

1736
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:52,870
yeah.
Unless there's some reason in principle 

1737
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,870
why you count.
So what do you do?

1738
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:55,100
You send those out there replicators.
They can go to asteroids.

1739
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:58,310
Mine print three d print a version of 
themselves,

1740
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:03,340
go off again.
they exponentiate they can crawl over 

1741
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,220
the galaxy,
exploring for free.

1742
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,280
They send them out,
we see no evidence of those things.

1743
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:11,210
And they called von neumann machines.
So it's one of the great.

1744
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:16,360
You can either say that there's 
something in principle that stops you 

1745
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:19,301
doing it.
So actually there is something special 

1746
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:21,581
about intelligence and you just can't 
with some reason why you can't build a 

1747
01:27:21,581 --> 01:27:23,060
computer that's artificially 
intelligent.

1748
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:25,310
I don't see why that would be the case.
Oh,

1749
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:27,390
you could argue you can't build the self
replicating,

1750
01:27:27,391 --> 01:27:32,391
but you can because we are.
We're replicators and we operate in 

1751
01:27:32,391 --> 01:27:32,391
accord with the laws of physics.
So there.

1752
01:27:32,391 --> 01:27:37,120
So there's a replicated or the reason we
don't see them is because there aren't 

1753
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:40,130
any civilizations that ever got to that 
level in the milky way.

1754
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:42,730
So we're the tip of the spear.
No one what?

1755
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:44,280
We can't.
We couldn't be the first.

1756
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,520
It's very difficult to see how we could 
be the first.

1757
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:48,200
Someone has to be the first.
Why can't it be us?

1758
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:53,230
But because.
Because the milky way has been around 

1759
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:53,230
for the age of the universal use.

1760
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:55,490
Say don't you know the earth is 6,000
years old,

1761
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,050
do you not go on with the [inaudible] 
side?

1762
01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:03,490
So the timescales,
we're talking billions of years really 

1763
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:03,490
into planets,
billions of years,

1764
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:07,080
but it has to happen in a one time was 
somewhere and then sudden.

1765
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:11,750
And if you get one wave of these ais 
away into space,

1766
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:17,290
then you can show using computer models 
with realistic assumptions about rocky 

1767
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:21,651
power and things like that.
you can cover the galaxy in on 

1768
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:23,130
timescales of much less than a billion 
years.

1769
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:26,240
Actually million years less than that.
So it's a.

1770
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:29,540
You can shoW that you can cover the 
galaxy and your von neumann probes.

1771
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,960
You're replicators in,
you know,

1772
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:34,520
hundreds of thousands of years.
Let's say a million,

1773
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:35,420
2 million,
3 million,

1774
01:28:35,421 --> 01:28:40,421
10 million.
It doesn't matter because we've got 

1775
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:40,421
billions of years and yet we see no 
evidence of them,

1776
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:42,050
so,
so what are we to make of that?

1777
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:47,800
Either there's something wrong with our 
arguments that we're putting forward 

1778
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,340
that actually you can't build self 
replicating intelligent robots.

1779
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:54,880
I don't see why not,
but maybe there's something wrong with 

1780
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,681
that.
Or really civilizations are so rare that

1781
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,960
as you say,
we are the first to get to that level,

1782
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,530
but that's interesting,
isn't it?

1783
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,560
That that will be an interesting.
I always think I'm a segue sentence to 

1784
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,951
this,
so imagine we're the only civilization 

1785
01:29:10,951 --> 01:29:14,001
in the galaxy.
What a tremendous responsibility there 

1786
01:29:14,001 --> 01:29:15,570
is honors.
Imagine what that knowledge should do to

1787
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:18,270
our political processes.
The way that we think about ourselves,

1788
01:29:18,271 --> 01:29:23,271
the way that we get on together.
imagine how ridiculous it is to divide 

1789
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:26,550
our little world or into countries and 
another little war every now and again,

1790
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:27,930
important nuclear missiles at each 
other,

1791
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:33,050
if in fact there's nowhere else in the 
milky way galaxy where anybody thinks 

1792
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:36,420
anybody can look at the styles and think
about and have these conversations.

1793
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,750
What a ridiculous way to behave.
So I think the cosmology is gives a 

1794
01:29:42,571 --> 01:29:46,920
perspective which is not necessarily 
need to be humbling,

1795
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,900
it is humbling and that's perhaps a good
thing,

1796
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:49,830
but it doesn't need.

1797
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:53,640
You don't need to be depressed about it.
It could be quite elating you say,

1798
01:29:53,641 --> 01:29:58,641
well,
with what we are according to the 

1799
01:29:58,641 --> 01:29:59,700
evidence and the data at the moment is 
almost indescribably special.

1800
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,100
Our,
our tininess,

1801
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,380
our potential uniqueness,
our insignificance in a cosmic scale 

1802
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:11,520
actually makes us special because we're 
the only place.

1803
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:12,750
And so.
So these,

1804
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:17,780
these ideas are worth pursuing I think 
because they make you think about these 

1805
01:30:18,361 --> 01:30:20,700
issues,
doesn't it also point to our ego that we

1806
01:30:20,701 --> 01:30:25,701
think that our biological processes any 
more important than the exploding sons 

1807
01:30:25,701 --> 01:30:28,540
that are required to create carbon life 
in the first place or,

1808
01:30:28,810 --> 01:30:33,810
or any of the processes of the universe.
The answer that I think is that you're 

1809
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:33,810
right,
that in a,

1810
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:34,920
in a,
in a signal,

1811
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:40,010
in a completely logical sense,
we no more important or less important 

1812
01:30:40,010 --> 01:30:41,580
than the stars themselves.
You're right,

1813
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:42,720
which is natural objects.

1814
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:48,110
But I would counter by saying that 
people look for meaning in the universe.

1815
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:53,421
People like to look for meaning gets 
this one thing that we've done since we 

1816
01:30:53,421 --> 01:30:55,530
began to look at the stars.
The universe means something to me,

1817
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:56,550
doesn't it?
It does.

1818
01:30:56,580 --> 01:30:59,340
Meaning exists because it means 
something to us.

1819
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:02,910
So we know that it would be ridiculous 
to say the university is meaningless.

1820
01:31:02,911 --> 01:31:04,890
It means something in my relatively our 
families,

1821
01:31:04,891 --> 01:31:05,790
we have loved ones,
etc.

1822
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,660
So the fact that that meaning might be 
emergent,

1823
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:14,160
it might appear from the laws of nature 
and it is almost certainly transient.

1824
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:16,530
Unless we build these self replicating 
machines,

1825
01:31:16,531 --> 01:31:21,531
we will.
We're not going to last forever as a 

1826
01:31:21,531 --> 01:31:21,531
civilization probably.
so that to me,

1827
01:31:21,531 --> 01:31:24,420
that doesn't in any way water down the 
significance of it.

1828
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:28,410
So I think again,
cosmology can be,

1829
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,950
can be a poWerful,
uh,

1830
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:36,080
aid to philosophical thoughts in this 
sense because you have to accept that 

1831
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,110
there's meaning in the universe because 
it means something to us.

1832
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:41,330
I don't see why it has to be eternal.
I don't see why there was that meaning,

1833
01:31:41,331 --> 01:31:43,650
does it imply purpose?
I don't think there's any purpose to the

1834
01:31:43,651 --> 01:31:45,990
universe brings any point to our 
existence.

1835
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,890
But the fact that we exist at all is 
worth celebrating.

1836
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,020
You don't need to add anything else.
In fact,

1837
01:31:52,021 --> 01:31:53,730
you almost did it to me.
You're devalued it.

1838
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,980
So why would you?
This is remarkable.

1839
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:59,830
We emerged a single celled organisms 
probably before that.

1840
01:31:59,831 --> 01:31:59,930
We

1841
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,400
emerged some chemical reactions in in 
hydrothermal vents,

1842
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:08,401
probably down in the deep primordial 
oceans of ancient earth and over three 

1843
01:32:08,401 --> 01:32:09,730
point 8 billion years,
we've come to the point where we can sit

1844
01:32:09,731 --> 01:32:12,550
and think about the styles and have 
conversations like this.

1845
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:17,680
Is that not enough?
can we just leave it there?

1846
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,800
Why does it have to be a point?
There isn't a point.

1847
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,860
I don't think it's appalling to that,
but it's worth celebrating.

1848
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,140
Well,
it certainly is to us.

1849
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:27,460
To us,
it's amazing,

1850
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:32,461
but you know,
in a lot of ways isn't looking 

1851
01:32:32,461 --> 01:32:34,600
throughout the incredible cosmos for 
signs of life,

1852
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:39,250
like looking in a sea of parked mercedes
benz for dust,

1853
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:42,070
like one of these cars must be fucking 
dusty.

1854
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,830
JuSt cleaned them.
I'm going to find it.

1855
01:32:44,950 --> 01:32:48,580
And you're ignoring the incredible 
mechanisms that are in front of you.

1856
01:32:48,581 --> 01:32:51,460
There's an amazing technology.
antilock brakes.

1857
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,970
Fucking 12 inch computer screens that 
ended up gauges anymore.

1858
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,610
The cars drive for you,
they steer for you,

1859
01:32:57,611 --> 01:32:59,170
they break for you,
and we're like,

1860
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:02,050
one of these motherfuckers has dust on 
it just like us.

1861
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:10,230
These planets,
and we talked about our planet being 

1862
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:11,560
four point 6 billion years.
the universe is 13 point eight.

1863
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:16,650
We're looking for things that live 100 
years were like just got to be one out 

1864
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:19,861
there that sing songs somewhere.
There's a better rapper than jay zed and

1865
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:23,910
he's out there in the universe.
We've got to find him.

1866
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:30,140
We to find him.
This is a search and we're ignoring 

1867
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:32,700
steroids,
gamma rays and better rap.

1868
01:33:33,910 --> 01:33:37,230
We should read,
write and masses and reasons.

1869
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:42,840
Again though,
it doesn't take anything away from the 

1870
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,800
fascination of just,
you know,

1871
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,840
one of the beautiful things about being 
a human being is that we think about 

1872
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,051
these things and that we can communicate
and that you getting on this podcast 

1873
01:33:52,051 --> 01:33:56,911
can.
You're planting all these seeds in 

1874
01:33:56,911 --> 01:33:58,711
people's minds that are making them 
consider these thoughts and now it 

1875
01:33:58,711 --> 01:33:59,210
spreads.
And that's.

1876
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:03,970
That's one of the most fascInating 
things about the idea of intelligence is

1877
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:08,971
that intelligence begets intelligence.
Intelligence sort of stimulates other 

1878
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:10,600
intelligent.
It's not simply,

1879
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:15,710
I mean,
I think one of the reasons why you love 

1880
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:15,710
educating is like,
you know,

1881
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,210
how important this is for you and you 
want,

1882
01:34:16,211 --> 01:34:21,211
you've seen the spark and people's eyes 
when you explain these things to them 

1883
01:34:21,211 --> 01:34:25,020
and you realize that that person might 
spread that spark somewhere else and 

1884
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:26,830
this is really what this process is 
about in the first place,

1885
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:31,840
but it has meaning to us.
But in the grand scheme of things,

1886
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:35,620
we're just exporting kardashians through
the universe.

1887
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:42,240
Well,
we could make it stop by exploiting.

1888
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,600
They could see the resistance of 
exploring the kardashians makes people,

1889
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:51,780
you know,
the new version of cosmos with neil 

1890
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:52,510
degrasse tyson bag that gets out there 
to which said,

1891
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:55,460
that makes me optimistic actually,
because I wouldn't have either.

1892
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:57,770
I think it's all together.
He'd done

1893
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:58,970
again.
You know,

1894
01:34:58,971 --> 01:34:59,410
I,
I,

1895
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:01,220
I,
I have to because carl sagan,

1896
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,590
great hero of mine.
I mean,

1897
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:05,990
the fact that it would be doing them on 
the fox in a network,

1898
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,060
you know,
a 13 episodes of it is.

1899
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:10,310
It is,
it is.

1900
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:12,260
There are people out there who want to 
do it.

1901
01:35:13,060 --> 01:35:13,350
Yeah.

1902
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:19,100
Are most certainly and more so now than 
I think ever before and more so in the 

1903
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:24,011
future.
I think even though there is evidence 

1904
01:35:24,011 --> 01:35:26,471
that people are dumb as shit,
there's still more evidence that people 

1905
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:27,520
were super curious.
I think it's just a,

1906
01:35:27,521 --> 01:35:31,430
it's a numbers thing and if you spoon 
feed people the same thing over and over

1907
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:32,600
again,
like you know,

1908
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:34,130
there's the argument for a limited 
network,

1909
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:40,510
especially american style or you could 
just sort of do it the bbc way,

1910
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:45,710
but the bbc way is beautiful and that 
sort of sandwiches,

1911
01:35:45,711 --> 01:35:47,790
these brilliant shows in between other 
shows like,

1912
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,080
but not enough.
There's not enough room.

1913
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:52,700
There's too many things out there now 
there's,

1914
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:57,730
you only have 24 hours in a day.
There's no fucking way you're going to 

1915
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:57,730
have enough programming.
You just.

1916
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:59,440
Unless you have an infinite number of 
bbcs like he,

1917
01:35:59,470 --> 01:36:00,470
you,
you can't.

1918
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,500
There's just too much shit going on.
The world is too vast and that's not 

1919
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:09,161
discounting anything that the bbc has 
ever done because one of my favorite 

1920
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:09,161
networks,
I'm like,

1921
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:12,500
I have this Congo series that I've 
probably watched a dozen times about the

1922
01:36:12,501 --> 01:36:17,501
bbc,
which is one of the most fascinating 

1923
01:36:17,501 --> 01:36:19,901
documentary documentaries,
not just on a particular area of the 

1924
01:36:19,901 --> 01:36:20,840
world,
but on life itself.

1925
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:25,841
Adapting,
which is like the primary sort of theme 

1926
01:36:25,841 --> 01:36:29,801
to that,
to that documentary where they're 

1927
01:36:29,801 --> 01:36:31,571
talking about these,
these parts of the world that were 

1928
01:36:31,571 --> 01:36:33,920
changed really rapidly over a period of 
a couple thousand years where we used to

1929
01:36:33,921 --> 01:36:38,921
be planes and then it became these dense
rain forest and there's all these 

1930
01:36:38,921 --> 01:36:43,091
animals that are sort of trapped in this
world like rhinos and plains animals.

1931
01:36:43,491 --> 01:36:46,130
And Were.
There was a piece on these,

1932
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:51,140
um,
these type of antelope color diker that 

1933
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,210
swims underwater a 100 yards.
They can fucking swim.

1934
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:54,950
They eat fish.
I mean,

1935
01:36:54,951 --> 01:36:58,280
it's craziness if swimming and swimming 
as well,

1936
01:36:58,281 --> 01:37:03,281
it's related to an antelope.
but the idea is that you're talking 

1937
01:37:03,281 --> 01:37:03,890
about a very short period of time,
a couple thousand years.

1938
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:07,280
That's had this rapid amount of change.
These animals have had to adapt.

1939
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:09,470
That is very strange.
New environment.

1940
01:37:10,770 --> 01:37:11,730
I think the,
the,

1941
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,250
the,
the,

1942
01:37:13,270 --> 01:37:14,160
the,
uh,

1943
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:19,330
inability of some people to understand 
that evolution and therefore react 

1944
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:21,630
against it.
It's all actually just,

1945
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:24,910
just religiously motivated.
Most of it is,

1946
01:37:24,911 --> 01:37:29,911
but some of it isn't.
I think there's also a lack of 

1947
01:37:29,911 --> 01:37:31,981
understanding of the timescales involved
and how fast animals can adapt and 

1948
01:37:31,981 --> 01:37:34,170
change.
And what a powerful sieve,

1949
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:37,840
if you like evolution is you can see it 
richard dawkins often,

1950
01:37:37,841 --> 01:37:40,420
right when he's writing beautifully 
about these things,

1951
01:37:40,421 --> 01:37:45,320
writes about and look at domestic dogs 
and look how quickly the,

1952
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:50,370
the,
the wolf got turned into these sort of 

1953
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,460
ready for poodles to german shepherds to
whatever It is.

1954
01:37:51,461 --> 01:37:55,590
All those things that now that selection
by humans,

1955
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:57,540
right?
So we're selecting particular traits,

1956
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:02,900
but the environment and the interaction 
with other species is as powerful as 

1957
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,470
that.
It's as efficient as that.

1958
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:07,720
It's the environment is a very powerful 
selector of,

1959
01:38:07,810 --> 01:38:08,550
of traits.

1960
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:12,330
Then so you can see that evolution 
happens quickly.

1961
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:15,750
Speciation happens quickly.
They're not quite with the dogs.

1962
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:20,751
They still the same species,
but you can see how given a bit of time 

1963
01:38:20,751 --> 01:38:24,080
you're going to get the poodles and keep
going on that line and get the wolves 

1964
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:27,590
and keep going on that line and 
eventually you're going to get things 

1965
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:29,791
that look so different that if you 
separate them and don't let them into 

1966
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:33,420
breed that you're going to end up with 
something that can't breed with that 

1967
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,321
anymore and that's kind of the 
definition of a new space is one of the 

1968
01:38:36,321 --> 01:38:37,230
definitions of a new species.
So you can see how It can happen,

1969
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,910
but I think one of the problems is the 
timescales are not understood.

1970
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:44,940
When you talk about thousands of years,
that's quite a long time.

1971
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,680
Ten thousand years,
a long time,

1972
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:48,660
200,000
years.

1973
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:52,200
You go back that long and we didn't 
exist as a species.

1974
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:54,420
We weren't there so.
So,

1975
01:38:54,421 --> 01:38:55,560
you know,
100,000

1976
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:58,170
years Is a hell of a long time.

1977
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:00,190
Yeah.
Too,

1978
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:05,250
too long too.
I think in our mind to process like we 

1979
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:07,330
can kind of process a lifetime,
you know,

1980
01:39:07,331 --> 01:39:10,960
we can process birth to a hundred years 
while he lived to be 100.

1981
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:12,070
Wow.
A lot of what?

1982
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:16,810
A lot of things that guy must've seen.
But to process 100 of those.

1983
01:39:17,170 --> 01:39:19,990
Yeah,
100 hundreds.

1984
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:22,330
How about a thousand?
How about 100,000?

1985
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:23,420
Uh,
yeah,

1986
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,120
It's,
it's just too much going on.

1987
01:39:25,121 --> 01:39:26,890
There's too much change that a long 
time.

1988
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:31,950
Do you subscribe to the idea,
and I've heard this debated about that 

1989
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:35,491
human intelligence may be in some form 
exponential and that all the knowledge 

1990
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:41,580
that people have acquIred mean obviously
not like in a physical sense like 

1991
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:41,610
you're,
you're,

1992
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,390
you're,
you're not born with an understanding of

1993
01:39:43,391 --> 01:39:46,240
math and language and all these things 
are learned,

1994
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:51,270
but that intelligence may somehow 
another be not just passed on from 

1995
01:39:52,091 --> 01:39:57,091
generation to generation,
but enhanced by life's experiences and 

1996
01:39:57,091 --> 01:40:00,550
that the genes that are transmitted from
you to your children may be in fact more

1997
01:40:00,551 --> 01:40:05,551
powerful than the genes you were given 
and that as you've lived your life and 

1998
01:40:05,551 --> 01:40:08,410
acquired information and knowledge and 
understanding and whatever,

1999
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,630
whatever intelligence means,
you know,

2000
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:15,370
whatever sort of intangible idea 
intelligence truly is,

2001
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,620
but that this mind power,
this,

2002
01:40:17,621 --> 01:40:21,070
this,
this accumulation over the 200,000

2003
01:40:21,071 --> 01:40:26,071
years that human beings have existed and
people breeding and getting to this 

2004
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:27,820
point,
that this might exponentially be growing

2005
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:28,570
and expanding.

2006
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:31,030
Is that,
is that in any way possible that we're,

2007
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:31,530
I,

2008
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:35,730
I'm not an expert on genetics?
I don't think so.

2009
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:40,820
I don't think there's any evidence as 
far as I know that our iq average iq to 

2010
01:40:42,331 --> 01:40:45,960
change much over the last few hundred 
years,

2011
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:47,090
certainly.
Um,

2012
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:48,990
so.
So as far as I know,

2013
01:40:48,991 --> 01:40:53,160
that's not the way that it works.
There's the you need,

2014
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:59,010
I think some kind of selector that would
say you'd have to take the most 

2015
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:03,520
intelligent levels by some measure,
let's say.

2016
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:08,970
And,
and have them be more successful at 

2017
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:10,960
producing offspring than the people who 
are less intelligent.

2018
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:11,530
You'd have to do,

2019
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,140
but isn't it?
You need some mechanism.

2020
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:18,580
Why haven't they done like those do the 
sperm banks were really super 

2021
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,770
intelligent people and like the kids 
that come out of it or smartest shit.

2022
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,400
Oh well that I could imagine that might 
be true.

2023
01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:27,420
I think the correct answer 
scientifically,

2024
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:32,430
if you don't know the link between,
we don't know enough about the genetics 

2025
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:35,521
and the genome,
the human genome to say which bits are 

2026
01:41:35,521 --> 01:41:36,350
producing brain power.
If research they.

2027
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,050
Well,
what is it that you know,

2028
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:43,051
which genes are really intelligent gene 
or set of genes and I think that that's 

2029
01:41:43,061 --> 01:41:44,980
not known I think is the right thing to 
say,

2030
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:50,070
but I emphasize it's not my field,
but it must have something to ponder.

2031
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:55,111
When you think about evolution,
you think about genetic knowledge and 

2032
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:58,261
that the like certain things that I 
would perhaps argue with that the idea 

2033
01:41:58,261 --> 01:42:02,050
that.
I know there's some interest in this,

2034
01:42:02,051 --> 01:42:04,150
but I think that the standard answer is 
that the,

2035
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:07,890
the knowledge let's say,
so I become educated that,

2036
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
that I think the standard answer is that
that would not have any impact on the 

2037
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:17,131
jeans that I passed to my offspring.
I don't think there's any known 

2038
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,140
mechanism to,
to have knowledge in imprinted,

2039
01:42:19,170 --> 01:42:22,630
so back into your genetic code such that
it can be sent onto your thing,

2040
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:25,900
but you know,
you may have seen otherwise.

2041
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:28,720
I,
I'm not aware of any research.

2042
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:33,880
It's hard to like look into a kid's head
and find out exactly where all the 

2043
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:33,880
information is coming from.
Right?

2044
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:35,560
Yeah.
But I don't think there's a known.

2045
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:40,240
Well,
there isn't a known a known.

2046
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,240
Was that just something we have to

2047
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:46,340
tri caster just freeze up on us.
People at home right now are freaking 

2048
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:49,561
the fuck out.
We were just about to get to the bottom 

2049
01:42:49,561 --> 01:42:51,691
of this.
I'm instincts like humans have certain 

2050
01:42:51,691 --> 01:42:51,691
instincts,
right?

2051
01:42:51,691 --> 01:42:55,210
Like there's people have fears like 
genetically sort of predisposed fears to

2052
01:42:55,211 --> 01:42:57,310
like scary dogs,
animals.

2053
01:42:57,340 --> 01:43:02,340
I mean we know you don't have to have a 
dog bite you to know the dogs fucking 

2054
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:05,581
terrifying.
Like what is that like when a dog is 

2055
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:05,740
growling?
Like kids are afraid of teeth,

2056
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:07,540
they're afraid of big teeth and 
monsters.

2057
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:09,190
Like even children that grow up in 
cities,

2058
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:14,340
they're afraid of monsters.
And the idea behind that that I've 

2059
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:14,350
heard,
I think it was rupert sheldrake there,

2060
01:43:14,351 --> 01:43:19,351
was talking about this.
He was saying that it may very well be 

2061
01:43:19,351 --> 01:43:23,401
that these memories of being preyed upon
by like cats like that.

2062
01:43:25,481 --> 01:43:28,480
These genetic memories that are from our
ancient,

2063
01:43:28,481 --> 01:43:29,800
ancient,
ancient ancestors.

2064
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:32,430
When we didn't have homes and we were 
living in trees and we were.

2065
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:37,830
Things were running after us trying to 
eat us and these ideas are passed down 

2066
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:40,390
from animal to animal and eventually 
human to human.

2067
01:43:40,610 --> 01:43:45,610
I don't think it's as far as I know,
there's no solid evidence that suggests 

2068
01:43:45,981 --> 01:43:49,040
that things you experience as a,
as a,

2069
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,520
as an adult or child,
the experiences themselves can be can be

2070
01:43:54,651 --> 01:43:59,651
passed on the other than the verbally to
them when they're listening to your 

2071
01:43:59,651 --> 01:44:02,891
stories that I'm not aware of.
Any mechanism that's known that would 

2072
01:44:02,891 --> 01:44:02,950
allow that to happen,

2073
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:07,990
haven't they've proven that genetics,
epigenetics and the in some some memes 

2074
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:12,590
like even useless ones like racism can 
be transmitted from parent to child.

2075
01:44:12,950 --> 01:44:15,260
Not that I'm aware of,
but I don't know.

2076
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,030
Obviously not my field of study either.
just a.

2077
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:23,570
I'm just fascinated by the idea that we 
don't totally understand all of the.

2078
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:28,490
All the ingredients of the mind and 
that's certainly true.

2079
01:44:28,610 --> 01:44:31,040
That's certainly true,
but I'm not aware of.

2080
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:36,180
I don't know.
I doubt it because I can't see a 

2081
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:37,310
mechanism.
Brown butter?

2082
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:38,310
No.
Are we back up,

2083
01:44:38,311 --> 01:44:40,160
jamie?
What's going on?

2084
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:42,430
Tri caster froze.
Oh,

2085
01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:44,420
what a piece of shit that we paid 
$15,000

2086
01:44:44,421 --> 01:44:46,670
for.
How dare you try castor people?

2087
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:52,090
Meanwhile,
we should probably be excited that 

2088
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:54,401
someone figured that fucking thing out.
You think it might have to do with the 

2089
01:44:54,401 --> 01:44:54,740
box and it gets heated up.
I have no idea.

2090
01:44:54,860 --> 01:44:56,740
No.
Just shit out on us.

2091
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:59,600
Yeah,
most likely,

2092
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:00,650
right?
How dare they?

2093
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:07,240
One of the things that was proposed that
I read recently was that black holes 

2094
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:07,850
aren't real.
Is that nonsense?

2095
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:10,280
Is that like one person's controversial 
idea?

2096
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:11,600
Yeah.

2097
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:12,930
Yeah.
Basically,

2098
01:45:12,931 --> 01:45:15,900
it's not necessarily nonsense just 
because it's one person's idea,

2099
01:45:15,901 --> 01:45:20,901
but it's likely to be nonsense.
I haven't seen that particular theory,

2100
01:45:21,211 --> 01:45:22,480
so I don't know.
I mean the.

2101
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:26,250
We have a lot of good evidence for the 
existence of black holes.

2102
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:31,270
Not least theY predicted there 
prediction of einstein's theory of 

2103
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:34,971
general relativity and they're there.
They're on solid theoretical ground and 

2104
01:45:34,971 --> 01:45:37,380
we've seen the signatures of them.
So for example,

2105
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:40,020
the object at the center of the milky 
way galaxy,

2106
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:45,770
we know what the masses of that object,
because we've measured the orbits of 

2107
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:49,281
stars very close to it.
We know what the maximum size of the 

2108
01:45:49,281 --> 01:45:52,941
object can be because it can be bigger 
than the orbits of the styles that go 

2109
01:45:52,941 --> 01:45:53,600
around it,
and so we measure its mass.

2110
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:58,620
I think it's about 4 million times the 
mass of the sun and the only way that 

2111
01:45:58,620 --> 01:46:02,070
our current laws of physics allow such 
an object to exist and be so small is 

2112
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:06,320
for it to be a black hole.
So there's good evidence that black 

2113
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:06,840
holes are around,
but you can always say,

2114
01:46:06,841 --> 01:46:07,410
well,
you know,

2115
01:46:07,411 --> 01:46:12,411
we've never been to one.
They're very hard to photograph because 

2116
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:12,411
they're black,
but you can,

2117
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:14,190
but you can photograph the stuff that 
falls into them.

2118
01:46:14,191 --> 01:46:16,530
You can see the signature of stuff 
fallen into them,

2119
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:17,670
which we do

2120
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:20,010
and they've,
they've.

2121
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:23,100
What was it like?
It was somewhere in the two thousands.

2122
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:28,130
They figured out that at the center of 
every galaxies of supermassive black 

2123
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:29,370
hole that is like one half of one 
percent of the mass,

2124
01:46:29,371 --> 01:46:30,780
the galaxy or something along those 
lines.

2125
01:46:30,781 --> 01:46:30,990
We

2126
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:31,990
think so.
As I said,

2127
01:46:31,991 --> 01:46:36,991
I think off the top of my head,
I think it's about 4 million times the 

2128
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:39,771
mass of the sun,
so the larger galaxies would have a 

2129
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:39,771
larger black hole.
I'm not sure if it's that.

2130
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:45,200
It's not well understood actually 
because he's not well understood how 

2131
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:48,411
galaxies form in the first place and 
what role the supermassive black holes 

2132
01:46:48,451 --> 01:46:53,451
having the formation of the galaxies,
so that's a real active area of 

2133
01:46:53,451 --> 01:46:54,990
research.
Actually a good question.

2134
01:46:55,040 --> 01:47:00,040
The thing that I was reading was there 
were debating the possibility that 

2135
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:01,240
inside each one of these supermassive 
black holes,

2136
01:47:01,241 --> 01:47:03,980
so like there being hundreds of billions
of galaxies,

2137
01:47:03,981 --> 01:47:06,650
each one of them with a black hole in 
the center of it,

2138
01:47:06,651 --> 01:47:11,651
a supermassive black hole in through 
that black hole is a whole nother 

2139
01:47:11,651 --> 01:47:13,040
universe with hundreds of billions of 
galaxies.

2140
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:18,041
Each with black holes go through that 
whole hundred billion more galaxies.

2141
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:21,110
Each with black holes go through that 
hundred dollars,

2142
01:47:21,111 --> 01:47:22,140
billion more that

2143
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:26,940
each galaxy itself literally as a portal
to a completely different universe.

2144
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:31,941
We,
I mean we don't have a problem with 

2145
01:47:31,941 --> 01:47:36,770
black holes,
is that their prediction of einstein's 

2146
01:47:36,770 --> 01:47:37,870
theory?
One of the earliest predictions,

2147
01:47:37,871 --> 01:47:40,470
there's a thing called the swatch child 
metric,

2148
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:44,360
which describes black holes.
It was done I think in 1915 or 16 years,

2149
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:49,370
right as soon as relativity was 
published is when they're showing that 

2150
01:47:49,370 --> 01:47:50,700
these things could exist,
um,

2151
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,710
but uh,
we don't.

2152
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:57,690
The theory itself Breaks down and then 
the theory of black holes,

2153
01:47:57,940 --> 01:48:02,940
the general relativity,
which is the theory that explained 

2154
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:02,940
einstein's theory rejects so predicts 
their existence,

2155
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:05,850
but it doesn't.
The characteristics of black holes,

2156
01:48:06,120 --> 01:48:08,790
the physics inside black holes is not 
understood.

2157
01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:10,920
We don't know.
Our theories don't work.

2158
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:15,210
We need what's called a quantum theory 
of gravity to make progress there.

2159
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:20,390
So that's the unification of quantum 
theory and relativity and general 

2160
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:24,171
relativity,
which is what string theory is an 

2161
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:26,571
attempt to do,
but we don't know whether that's the 

2162
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:26,571
right theory.

2163
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:26,571
So,
so,

2164
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:26,571
so we will see this is the edge of 
knowledge.

2165
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:31,520
So we don't know.
We don't know what we don't know how to 

2166
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,610
describe black holes.
Probably we have a theory that's capable

2167
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:37,611
of describing.
We can describe the edge of this thing 

2168
01:48:37,611 --> 01:48:37,740
about an event horizon and all that 
stuff that works.

2169
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:39,840
That's not a problem in einstein's 
theory,

2170
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:43,230
so the idea that if you have a 
sufficiently den subject,

2171
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:48,740
then there's a region around it.
I'm out of which light contest scape 

2172
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:51,720
because space and time are to curb for 
light to get out.

2173
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,010
That's,
that's fine.

2174
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:56,100
The theory describes that properly,
but when you go,

2175
01:48:56,130 --> 01:49:01,130
when you start asking questions about 
what happens at the center of a black 

2176
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:01,130
hole,
a singularity,

2177
01:49:01,130 --> 01:49:04,970
that very idea,
it's called a singularity tells you 

2178
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:05,730
their infinities in the theory.
The theory is doing things is infinitely

2179
01:49:05,731 --> 01:49:07,050
dentist.
It's infinitely small.

2180
01:49:07,050 --> 01:49:07,890
It's,
well,

2181
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:09,420
no,
it won't be it.

2182
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:14,850
We don't have infinities in general in 
nature other than perhaps the size of 

2183
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:15,500
the university as you say.
It's so,

2184
01:49:15,550 --> 01:49:16,000
so,
um,

2185
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:19,950
so there's something going on there,
but we don't have the physical theory.

2186
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:24,090
We don't have the tools to describe it.
It's an active area of research.

2187
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,520
So I don't know.
He's a good answer in science.

2188
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,010
Right?
And so speculations fun,

2189
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,450
but,
but ultimately,

2190
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:31,620
you know,
we're talking about,

2191
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,870
we're talking about a regime of nature,
uh,

2192
01:49:35,040 --> 01:49:35,880
which,
which,

2193
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:41,180
which are current theories and not 
capable of describing with any 

2194
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:41,180
authority.
And that's,

2195
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:45,381
that's the inside of a black hole.
We were talking about this before the 

2196
01:49:45,381 --> 01:49:48,951
podcast,
the difference between the way you 

2197
01:49:48,951 --> 01:49:51,531
present your shows and the bbc and the 
way you're sort of forced to present 

2198
01:49:51,531 --> 01:49:56,101
your shows on the science channel.
And this was one of the very issues as a

2199
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:01,420
little bit,
I mean that's dealing with unknowns,

2200
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:06,480
dealing with what you're describing,
things like black holes or like the 

2201
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:11,821
event horizon of a black hole that there
are points in time where you have to say

2202
01:50:12,490 --> 01:50:13,300
we don't know yet.

2203
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:18,540
Yeah.
That we were talking earlier and I said 

2204
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,750
because at the moment we're a cyber 
series in the uk called human universe,

2205
01:50:19,751 --> 01:50:21,710
which has been on in the uk,
um,

2206
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:26,910
five episodes one hour long.
So we also make them with science 

2207
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,661
channel and besides channels one hour,
it's 43 minutes because they have 

2208
01:50:30,661 --> 01:50:30,661
adverts,
right?

2209
01:50:30,661 --> 01:50:31,930
Commercials.
So fine,

2210
01:50:31,990 --> 01:50:34,530
that's the way.
So we've got to take 17 minutes out.

2211
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:39,530
But also we have some interaction about,
well how do we nuance things for the.

2212
01:50:40,150 --> 01:50:45,150
Because you'll do things for a british 
market that will be different in 

2213
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:48,340
american market.
And one of my favorites recently was 

2214
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:50,881
that one of the programs is about this 
multiverse that we just talked about 

2215
01:50:50,881 --> 01:50:54,391
earlier.
The fact that may be an infinite number 

2216
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:56,251
of universes.
The universe may have been around 

2217
01:50:56,251 --> 01:50:58,291
forever.
There may be no beginning to the 

2218
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:58,291
universe,
all speculative,

2219
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:58,291
right?

2220
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:58,900
Then they have it.
So what does that mean?

2221
01:50:58,901 --> 01:51:01,090
It means that our existence is 
inevitable.

2222
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:06,360
We have to exist in an infinite universe
and we are because we have to be.

2223
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:12,030
So there's no purpose to our existence.
There is no universal meaning to our 

2224
01:51:12,131 --> 01:51:13,240
existence.
We are,

2225
01:51:13,241 --> 01:51:16,030
because we have to be an in the,
in the british virgin,

2226
01:51:16,031 --> 01:51:17,320
I say.
So to the camera.

2227
01:51:17,321 --> 01:51:22,321
How does that make you feel?
And the wonderful thing is nobody knows 

2228
01:51:22,321 --> 01:51:23,020
this is new.
Physics is right at the edge.

2229
01:51:23,021 --> 01:51:28,021
It's speculative,
but we're beginning to address it with 

2230
01:51:28,021 --> 01:51:31,621
the data and the theories.
So we need theologians and philosophers 

2231
01:51:31,621 --> 01:51:32,970
and artists and novelists.
We need to discuss these things.

2232
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:38,160
What does it mean for us?
If we're at our existence is inevitable 

2233
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:39,730
and we're not special,
but yet we may still be valuable.

2234
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:44,920
It doesn't mean I don't know.
So the last thing I say in a british 

2235
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:47,911
version is so,
so what do you think say to the 

2236
01:51:47,911 --> 01:51:50,041
audience,
and I think it's beautiful and it's 

2237
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:50,041
filmed over tokyo over tokyo skylight I 
think is beautiful.

2238
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,510
But I did get a note from the science 
channel saying,

2239
01:51:52,810 --> 01:51:55,600
well the thing is that this is not the 
style on the.

2240
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:57,670
So we,
we tend to try and leave the viewer with

2241
01:51:57,671 --> 01:51:58,720
some concrete things.
So.

2242
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:04,050
So can you tell them what it means for 
the song and what the meaning of life,

2243
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:10,770
the meaning,
the great existential question of what 

2244
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:11,320
does it mean to exist?
you want me to answer that?

2245
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,030
Yes,
that'd be better for,

2246
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:14,710
for our audience.
It's like,

2247
01:52:14,711 --> 01:52:18,820
well I really,
I'm a bit.

2248
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:21,030
So I said,
you know,

2249
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:22,690
what?
Can you tell me what to say?

2250
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:25,720
Perhaps I'd love it if.
Look if science channel,

2251
01:52:26,140 --> 01:52:31,140
if you know the meaning of life,
then we tell me and I'll gladly say on 

2252
01:52:31,331 --> 01:52:32,080
the blog,
I don't know.

2253
01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:35,650
So it was kind of interesting.
There's that difference in style,

2254
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:37,320
but I loved it that they said,
can we do.

2255
01:52:37,370 --> 01:52:40,100
We really do want you to broadcast the 
meaning of life undiscovered.

2256
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:45,290
Nine o'clock,
because I can see how it'd be great 

2257
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:45,290
sell,
you know,

2258
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:45,440
undiscovered tonight after sharks,
you know,

2259
01:52:45,441 --> 01:52:50,441
whatever they put on extra shot,
we were going to do the meaning of life 

2260
01:52:50,441 --> 01:52:53,570
with professor Brian Cox.
Brian cox will tell you what it means to

2261
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:58,571
exist for your existence,
to be inevitable in a possibly infinite 

2262
01:52:58,571 --> 01:52:59,600
cosmos.
Find out at nine I either.

2263
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:02,750
So it would be good.
It wouldn't be completely subjective.

2264
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:07,700
What life means to you doesn't you know 
jamie as a differences that need.

2265
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,100
This is what we do do.
I do do in the series I.

2266
01:53:10,110 --> 01:53:13,520
This is what it's about.
It's a love letter to the human race,

2267
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:14,750
human universe.
It's a.

2268
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:20,170
You see that?
Certainly if you buy the one hour 

2269
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:22,961
version,
I don't know how it's gonna pan out in 

2270
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:22,961
43,
but if you,

2271
01:53:22,961 --> 01:53:23,720
if you get the one which you can buy 
from good retailers on the internet,

2272
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,910
it turns Out you need a.

2273
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:29,210
It's not an itunes at the moment,
but you need it.

2274
01:53:29,211 --> 01:53:34,070
You need a 10 ati blu ray player.
I will say you do that,

2275
01:53:34,071 --> 01:53:36,230
not all us dvd players play 10,
eight year.

2276
01:53:36,231 --> 01:53:39,300
I content your plates and aup content,
technical stuff.

2277
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:42,170
One of them is called interlaced and one
of them is called progressive scan.

2278
01:53:42,171 --> 01:53:44,590
There's virtually no difference except 
that in europe we tend to.

2279
01:53:44,750 --> 01:53:49,750
So some of your blue ray players in 
America will play it and some of them 

2280
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:50,770
won't.
It turns out I just found out they,

2281
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,050
it's the one that the under blue ray,
you can buy it.

2282
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:59,470
But um,
and I encourage you to because it's 

2283
01:53:59,470 --> 01:53:59,470
wonderful.
But um,

2284
01:53:59,470 --> 01:53:59,470
but,
uh,

2285
01:53:59,470 --> 01:54:00,230
but so,
so there's something so,

2286
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:02,150
but it'll be unsigned channel anyway in 
a few months,

2287
01:54:02,151 --> 01:54:04,150
but it will cut down a bit.
But the,

2288
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:07,370
but the central message is this,
that it we talked about earlier,

2289
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:07,730
the,
the,

2290
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:10,220
it leads you,
I think to value the human race.

2291
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:12,440
So there's like we filmed in Ethiopia,
which I love.

2292
01:54:12,441 --> 01:54:17,441
I always love filling in Ethiopia 
because we were in the rift valley 

2293
01:54:17,441 --> 01:54:18,050
filming this story about the emergence 
of humans from the rift valley.

2294
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:21,710
And then we filmed in some I call the 
danica depression,

2295
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:24,130
which is one of the,
other than death valley,

2296
01:54:24,131 --> 01:54:26,600
you advise with death valley often for 
the hottest place on earth,

2297
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:29,500
but it's far more barren and death 
valley.

2298
01:54:29,501 --> 01:54:34,501
So if in northern Ethiopia on the 
eritrean border there are volcanoes and 

2299
01:54:34,501 --> 01:54:38,531
it's bleak and,
but there's a tribe of people call the 

2300
01:54:38,531 --> 01:54:41,321
fr that lived there and they fascinating
and I stayed with them a few years ago 

2301
01:54:41,321 --> 01:54:42,680
and they don't have a concept for 
example,

2302
01:54:42,681 --> 01:54:45,260
of possessions because they don't have 
anything.

2303
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:48,350
They just live on these volcanoes,
in this wasteland.

2304
01:54:48,600 --> 01:54:53,600
So.
So they say if you put something down 

2305
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,810
like a something,
then they will legitimately pick it up 

2306
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:55,810
and they'll.

2307
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:57,470
And they'll say,
well I'm going to use it for a while.

2308
01:54:57,710 --> 01:55:01,640
So when your film crew you kind of,
there's no cultural idea.

2309
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:03,680
They're not stealing,
they're not taking stuff.

2310
01:55:03,780 --> 01:55:06,140
They don't have that idea because they 
don't have anything.

2311
01:55:06,410 --> 01:55:08,930
So they leave the camera,
they might get your camera.

2312
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:11,280
And we had some guards with those from 
the for tribe,

2313
01:55:11,290 --> 01:55:13,790
but it's a bit dangerous there.
And he had an ak 47,

2314
01:55:13,791 --> 01:55:17,750
this guy and he sat there with his ak 47
and then we woke up one day and we had a

2315
01:55:17,751 --> 01:55:22,751
mountaineer with us.
So he got one of his mountaineering 

2316
01:55:22,751 --> 01:55:23,520
ropes attached to his ak 47 and he sat 
there now with this rope.

2317
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:28,990
So the guy said to me,
she should I ask for it back because I 

2318
01:55:28,990 --> 01:55:31,190
know number one,
it's attached to an ak 47,

2319
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:36,940
which gives him the advantage.
We didn't believe we get into an 

2320
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:36,940
argument.
And number two,

2321
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,850
it's fascinating.
I have no idea of possession.

2322
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:40,670
But the reason I started saying that was
because we were filming.

2323
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,070
We talk about meaning in life and we 
said to this man who was called

2324
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,980
a,
you didn't allie a guy at if our tribe,

2325
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,970
small men,
probably four foot tall old.

2326
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:56,060
And we said,
we're talking to you about this through 

2327
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:56,060
a translator.
And he said to us on camera,

2328
01:55:56,060 --> 01:55:56,670
he said,
you said your,

2329
01:55:56,671 --> 01:55:59,610
your,
your eyes have your age,

2330
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:01,970
but your ears have your father's age,
your,

2331
01:56:01,971 --> 01:56:05,250
your is here the past and your eyes.
See the president.

2332
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:10,670
And this is the way you should live,
and I just thought what a beautiful 

2333
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:14,460
thing that came out of this man,
and so we put that in the series just in

2334
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:17,460
subtitled it and left it there because 
it's full of little.

2335
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:22,050
Just people celebrating those people is 
something you'd never see.

2336
01:56:22,051 --> 01:56:27,051
You don't think there are people who 
live on volcanoes in northern Ethiopia 

2337
01:56:27,051 --> 01:56:27,630
that say wonderful things about your 
ears.

2338
01:56:27,631 --> 01:56:32,631
I've been your father's age and your 
your eye in the past being used through 

2339
01:56:32,631 --> 01:56:35,910
your ears to manipulate an informed the 
way you behave in the present.

2340
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:40,940
Beautiful deep thoughts.
So we tried to fill the series with 

2341
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:44,751
those things as well.
So it's a mixture of cosmology and the 

2342
01:56:44,751 --> 01:56:45,310
celebration of the wonder of human 
existence.

2343
01:56:45,311 --> 01:56:48,780
The diversity of human thought.
It was beautiful stuff in there.

2344
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:51,630
A love letter to the human race and why 
not?

2345
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:53,970
Because we deserve it.
What we're so adaptabLe.

2346
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:58,971
The idea that people can live like that 
with no possessions the same time where 

2347
01:56:58,971 --> 01:57:00,220
people will live in a world that the r 
one,

2348
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:04,110
one of our biggest issues is that people
live to accumulate possessions.

2349
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:09,410
And the idea of materialism is it's,
it's like it very much like you were 

2350
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:14,601
talking about the 17 year old boy that 
only pays attention to video games that 

2351
01:57:14,601 --> 01:57:18,680
becoming obsessed with anything,
whether it's becoming obsessed with 

2352
01:57:18,680 --> 01:57:19,740
objects,
becoming obsessed with ideas.

2353
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,750
Hey,
we're human beings,

2354
01:57:21,810 --> 01:57:22,500
we,
we,

2355
01:57:22,710 --> 01:57:27,710
we are so flexible for so flexible in 
how we can exist as a culture or as a 

2356
01:57:28,681 --> 01:57:33,060
community that our ideas are so rigid 
that people have to be this way.

2357
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:38,060
And you know,
you can't run around on the Internet 

2358
01:57:38,060 --> 01:57:38,770
saying that there's no meaning to life 
when jesus,

2359
01:57:38,771 --> 01:57:43,771
his name is being broadcast right now on
christian ministries all throughout the 

2360
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:45,720
world.
They understand what the meaning of Life

2361
01:57:45,721 --> 01:57:47,040
is all about.
Brian cox,

2362
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:49,500
you are the one who is ignorant to the 
ways of the lord.

2363
01:57:49,530 --> 01:57:53,290
And I do think that the,
what I found is that travel.

2364
01:57:53,291 --> 01:57:54,630
Why would I,
because I filmed in,

2365
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:57,300
I just fill it in.
I'm actually freeing for the monkey cage

2366
01:57:57,301 --> 01:58:00,090
free monkey age because because we're 
doing the show is in their life.

2367
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:02,070
You have to have a different kind of us 
visa.

2368
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:02,870
Right?
So,

2369
01:58:02,871 --> 01:58:04,350
so and,
and the visa you have to put,

2370
01:58:04,351 --> 01:58:06,630
where were you been in the last five 
years?

2371
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:11,631
How many countries have you visited 
within the last five years and it at 38 

2372
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:13,830
I'd been to,
to fill in these things.

2373
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:15,960
30 eight countries.
I thought,

2374
01:58:15,961 --> 01:58:16,860
wow.
I didn't know that.

2375
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:17,730
That's a lot.
You know.

2376
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:23,220
And what's interesting,
what I found it really honestly is that 

2377
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:27,291
when you go to Ethiopia or India or 
Japan out into the wilds and these 

2378
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:29,460
places,
people tend to be relatively.

2379
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,760
Well,
everyone I've met is first of all but 

2380
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:36,861
interested in stuff.
So through the translator with the 

2381
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:40,580
tribe,
we talk about the styles and I say as 

2382
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:40,580
I've got stars and they're interested so
that they don't,

2383
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:42,100
they've never been to school.
They

2384
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,390
have their own education,
they're up,

2385
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:45,910
they're learning about how to live in a 
volcanic wasteland,

2386
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:51,240
but yet they're interested and the 
things they're interested in common I 

2387
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:55,471
find.
And I genuinely am anyone that I found 

2388
01:58:55,471 --> 01:58:56,050
uncomfortable,
I was uncomfortable with.

2389
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:59,470
I haven't met any of the maniacs that we
consider,

2390
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:01,630
we think of as in the world,
you know,

2391
01:59:01,631 --> 01:59:03,280
we think well it's okay here,
you know,

2392
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:08,290
in,
in north America or in europe or 

2393
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:08,290
something,
we're okay,

2394
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:08,290
but there's all these wild people out 
there,

2395
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:09,310
you know,
something I know.

2396
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:11,410
I just haven't seen any evidence of 
that.

2397
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:16,411
And so that's part of human universe.
It's just trying to put these 

2398
01:59:16,411 --> 01:59:16,411
impressions.
Yeah,

2399
01:59:16,411 --> 01:59:17,500
they believe different stuff.
So you might think,

2400
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:18,520
you know,
like you said,

2401
01:59:18,521 --> 01:59:20,380
there's the people who say,
well jesus is the way,

2402
01:59:20,381 --> 01:59:25,381
but then you'll go to India and you'll 
find that there are people who are 

2403
01:59:25,381 --> 01:59:28,640
hindus who strange beliefs towards,
you know,

2404
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:31,900
ganesh,
the blue elephant garden v,

2405
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:36,760
they're part of that fabric of 
understanding the universe.

2406
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:40,480
And I find it wonderful actually.
It tells you something,

2407
01:59:40,510 --> 01:59:40,890
the,
the,

2408
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:45,920
the,
there are some things that are cultural 

2409
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:45,920
and some things that are not religions,
cultural.

2410
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,620
You go different places,
you have different religions.

2411
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:51,250
That's not to say,
although I don't have any interest,

2412
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:53,530
any interest in religion,
I always said people ask me quite a lot,

2413
01:59:53,550 --> 01:59:54,630
you know?
Do you really been gardens?

2414
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:55,490
I know,
no,

2415
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:57,970
but I don't really even think about it 
until I get asked.

2416
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:00,730
I would've never just stumbled across 
that concept to myself.

2417
02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:01,720
I,
yeah.

2418
02:00:01,740 --> 02:00:04,120
I get asked a lot now because I do 
science on television.

2419
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:06,010
I know he said the same thing,
which is I don't really.

2420
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:07,860
I'm not really interested.
I don't think about it.

2421
02:00:07,861 --> 02:00:09,160
It's all.
Is that upset anybody?

2422
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:15,020
Well,
kind of because I don't want to be 

2423
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:15,020
dismissed.
I'm not trying to be missy and they just

2424
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:15,020
talk about your own personal interests.

2425
02:00:15,020 --> 02:00:17,760
Does that,
does that upset you?

2426
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,400
You're,
you're.

2427
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:20,590
What I'm saying is I'm just reaffirming 
what you're saying.

2428
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:22,660
You're just talking about your own 
personal interests,

2429
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:27,870
like why do,
why does your personal lack of an 

2430
02:00:27,870 --> 02:00:30,250
interest in something upset people,
but it seems to right?

2431
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:35,310
Well,
it can do because I think it says 

2432
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:36,190
central part of the framework they use 
to explain the world and meeting and all

2433
02:00:36,191 --> 02:00:37,570
these questions that we're discussing.
We should.

2434
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:40,390
Difficult questions and I think don't 
have answers,

2435
02:00:40,620 --> 02:00:41,950
right?
I don't eat it.

2436
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:45,040
It's a complicated question.
What does it mean to be alive?

2437
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:49,120
And as we said,
it obviously means something personally,

2438
02:00:49,121 --> 02:00:51,340
but I don't.
These are complicated question,

2439
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:56,790
but I think what's interesting is you go
around the world and you see that these 

2440
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:57,160
questions are common and people think 
about them in wherever they are,

2441
02:00:57,161 --> 02:01:02,161
wherever their level of education,
they have some framework for 

2442
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:04,351
understanding that,
but there are also commonalities are 

2443
02:01:04,351 --> 02:01:04,351
large.

2444
02:01:04,351 --> 02:01:08,340
The,
the curiosity about the stars is 

2445
02:01:08,340 --> 02:01:10,590
something that you see everywhere you 
see the curiosity about the origins of 

2446
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:13,240
the universe and there are stories which
are different all over the world.

2447
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:17,230
All in my view and in the human universe
view with an equally valid,

2448
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:18,030
right?
They're,

2449
02:01:18,031 --> 02:01:19,730
they're,
they're all worth it.

2450
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:22,630
I don't consider it from them.
I think they're interesting.

2451
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:27,660
They're interesting responses to nature.
I think it's these people that live 

2452
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:29,770
around this volcano.
How do they survive?

2453
02:01:29,771 --> 02:01:32,400
What are they eating?
Like they have goats.

2454
02:01:32,570 --> 02:01:33,430
Um,
the,

2455
02:01:33,431 --> 02:01:38,431
they managed to feed on the Limited tiny
amounts of limited vegetation that's 

2456
02:01:38,861 --> 02:01:40,310
there,
very little water.

2457
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:43,040
So they're very careful with the water,
um,

2458
02:01:43,220 --> 02:01:48,220
but they,
they've developed this way of living 

2459
02:01:48,220 --> 02:01:48,500
there.
They're remarkable,

2460
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:51,260
tough,
really tough bunch of people.

2461
02:01:51,261 --> 02:01:56,261
How many people live up there?
I don't know actually how big the font 

2462
02:01:56,261 --> 02:01:59,500
is,
but he's one of the Ethiopia is very 

2463
02:01:59,500 --> 02:01:59,500
tribal and it goes into Eritrea as well.

2464
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:00,560
So it's in this area,
at the top of the rift valley.

2465
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:04,970
It's called the triple afar junction,
which is a tectonics plate tectonics.

2466
02:02:04,971 --> 02:02:07,340
It's where all the volt vulcanism at the
top of the rift is.

2467
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,590
So it's the generator of the rift 
valley,

2468
02:02:09,591 --> 02:02:11,480
you'd be like,
is beautiful actually.

2469
02:02:11,481 --> 02:02:14,270
Is it an idea?
Because this is the cradle of humanity.

2470
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:14,910
So,
so,

2471
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:17,960
so you've got this is,
I find it a magical place actually.

2472
02:02:17,961 --> 02:02:22,961
Ethiopia for that reason.
And it said I recommend it actually had 

2473
02:02:22,961 --> 02:02:24,800
addie sandberg is a beautiful city.
He said high altitude city.

2474
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:26,860
Um,
so Ethiopia tend to think of,

2475
02:02:26,930 --> 02:02:28,580
especially if you're a kid of my 
generation,

2476
02:02:28,581 --> 02:02:30,710
you think in live aid and the big famine
in Ethiopia,

2477
02:02:30,711 --> 02:02:32,840
you think it is dusty place and it is in
some areas,

2478
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:34,460
but actually the,
the capital,

2479
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:37,520
it's a very green countries is high 
altitude,

2480
02:02:37,521 --> 02:02:42,521
quite pleasant city as some african 
cities when they're very hot and they 

2481
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:42,521
did.

2482
02:02:42,521 --> 02:02:46,970
It can be very unusual for people like 
us from places are not dusty and hot and

2483
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,010
but at is not like that actually.
And I was and I,

2484
02:02:50,011 --> 02:02:54,480
I find this an idea when I go there,
I like the idea that because you,

2485
02:02:54,481 --> 02:02:56,390
you kind of almost know that we came 
from there.

2486
02:02:56,391 --> 02:02:58,310
Somehow you come armed with this 
knowledge.

2487
02:02:58,311 --> 02:03:03,311
This is,
that we were all related to someone who 

2488
02:03:03,311 --> 02:03:06,491
lived here in,
in and around adis abba in the rift 

2489
02:03:06,491 --> 02:03:11,170
200,000
years ago were all related to someone 

2490
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:11,540
who lived there.
And we wandered out from there.

2491
02:03:11,541 --> 02:03:15,770
I find that a powerful thought actually,
and he dismisses,

2492
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:20,890
you know,
the great deal of talk of differences 

2493
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:20,930
amongst us.
but actually you go to Ethiopia,

2494
02:03:20,931 --> 02:03:24,710
you,
you realize very soon that we're not far

2495
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:26,560
back because you said you trace your 
generators,

2496
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:27,940
parents,
father,

2497
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:29,100
grandfather back,
right back.

2498
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:32,390
You don't go far back before you get to 
an ethiopian.

2499
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:35,720
She's quite wonderful.
I think so.

2500
02:03:35,721 --> 02:03:36,560
It's so pretty

2501
02:03:36,640 --> 02:03:40,010
active enhancing to to see people in 
this day and age.

2502
02:03:40,011 --> 02:03:45,011
I was watching a documentary on people 
that live in the amazon that are barely 

2503
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:48,380
contacted by the western world.
They sort of,

2504
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:52,160
they made have like american underwear 
or something that someone gives them.

2505
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:53,640
But other than that,
like you know,

2506
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:58,810
these people have been living 
essentially very similar to the way 

2507
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:00,920
they've been living thousands of years 
ago and they're getting by.

2508
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:04,010
They're fine and it just,
it makes you realize like how,

2509
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:09,490
how this world that we live in right now
that we think everybody has to have an 

2510
02:04:09,490 --> 02:04:11,750
email address,
everybody has to at least have some form

2511
02:04:11,751 --> 02:04:13,610
of public transportation.
No,

2512
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:14,570
they don't.
You don't.

2513
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:16,850
You don't have to have anything.
These people all walk around,

2514
02:04:17,060 --> 02:04:20,610
they walk around in the jungle and they 
live and they've been living like.

2515
02:04:20,620 --> 02:04:25,620
And They know what to eat,
you know what not to eat and they know 

2516
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:27,821
what to avoid and they have babies and 
their culture continues and they don't 

2517
02:04:27,821 --> 02:04:31,160
even write things down and they'd been 
living like that for a long time.

2518
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,990
And they're people just like you and 
just like me.

2519
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:34,520
Yeah.
With the same.

2520
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:39,210
I find the same level of curiosity and 
interest is,

2521
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,520
it's kind of sometime more so.
Well.

2522
02:04:41,521 --> 02:04:42,270
Yeah,
exactly.

2523
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:44,130
Yeah,
exactly.

2524
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,680
So it's very interested in that 
perspective.

2525
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:49,130
The people that you contacted in 
Ethiopia,

2526
02:04:49,160 --> 02:04:50,690
how many,
how many are in their group,

2527
02:04:50,930 --> 02:04:52,990
the ones that you were in contact with 
that?

2528
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:58,540
Um,
maybe I'd be guessing 100 or so in this 

2529
02:04:58,540 --> 02:04:59,500
kind of.
Do they have a writteN history?

2530
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,060
No,
no.

2531
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:03,070
Oral history.
Yeah.

2532
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:06,650
So these are stories passed down from 
generation,

2533
02:05:06,651 --> 02:05:08,830
so they're great storytellers.
Wow.

2534
02:05:08,890 --> 02:05:13,890
The results in these isolated tribes.
I mean obviouslY Ethiopia is a 

2535
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:18,181
fascinating country because it's one of 
the few countries in africa that in an 

2536
02:05:18,181 --> 02:05:18,750
ancient country,
I mean they,

2537
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:19,090
they,
they're,

2538
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:20,950
they're,
they're in biblical times.

2539
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:26,030
You know,
they've got these myths about when you 

2540
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:26,030
get to our this,
they say we've got the uh,

2541
02:05:26,030 --> 02:05:27,940
the ark of the covenant running 
cathedral in adis.

2542
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:29,200
Then you say,
can I see it?

2543
02:05:29,201 --> 02:05:29,710
And they go,
no,

2544
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:33,400
but iT's there.
But I like the mythology.

2545
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:37,030
The mythology is that the queen of sheba
was up there and stole it,

2546
02:05:37,450 --> 02:05:42,450
I think,
and came back and brought it back 

2547
02:05:42,450 --> 02:05:42,820
selling author of king solomon and 
solomon wouldn't.

2548
02:05:42,930 --> 02:05:44,020
So yeah,
so you've got this.

2549
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:46,500
It's all intertwined.
It's the fact that they're,

2550
02:05:46,501 --> 02:05:51,501
they're written history.
The central ethiopian written history 

2551
02:05:51,501 --> 02:05:51,501
is,
is,

2552
02:05:51,501 --> 02:05:53,290
is in the biblical,
in its,

2553
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:58,350
in its spanish ancient Egypt.
They were part of that thing that Egypt 

2554
02:05:58,350 --> 02:05:58,350
and,
and,

2555
02:05:58,350 --> 02:06:03,060
and in Ethiopia and then into jerusalem,
those areas palestine and then out to 

2556
02:06:03,590 --> 02:06:04,450
you that,
that,

2557
02:06:04,451 --> 02:06:09,451
that,
that thousand year old 2000 year old 

2558
02:06:09,451 --> 02:06:10,060
history is part of that country.
Very centrally part of it.

2559
02:06:10,390 --> 02:06:11,980
Whereas usually in africa,
you know,

2560
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:14,860
you get countries that were divided up 
and they came after the second world war

2561
02:06:14,861 --> 02:06:19,090
and he post-imperial things.
But Ethiopia is a real,

2562
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:23,890
a more grounded place in history.
So it's a fascinating place.

2563
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:29,070
What is the area that's supposed to 
contain the ark of the covenant that 

2564
02:06:29,070 --> 02:06:29,680
cathedral allegedly,
um,

2565
02:06:29,930 --> 02:06:31,870
in,
in this,

2566
02:06:32,260 --> 02:06:33,760
as I say,
I wasn't allowed to see it,

2567
02:06:33,761 --> 02:06:37,270
so I'm very tied that exist,
but only people were supposed to be like

2568
02:06:37,271 --> 02:06:38,320
looking at it.
How many,

2569
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:41,980
how nobody argues with this myth.

2570
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:47,220
So is it like al capone's vault where 
like it took joe geraldo rivera to break

2571
02:06:47,221 --> 02:06:48,930
down the wall before we realized there 
was nothing in it.

2572
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:54,080
I mean,
is there like a room that no one goes 

2573
02:06:54,080 --> 02:06:55,851
into?
I think other than the priests and 

2574
02:06:55,851 --> 02:06:59,870
things really,
I think that's because someone wants to 

2575
02:06:59,870 --> 02:07:04,851
build the cathedral in and obviously the
queen of shiva stolen in the first 

2576
02:07:04,851 --> 02:07:05,550
place.
So it's not there anymore.

2577
02:07:05,551 --> 02:07:08,400
It is let from jerusalem.
Oh,

2578
02:07:08,401 --> 02:07:09,740
and brought it to Ethiopia.
Yes.

2579
02:07:09,741 --> 02:07:11,130
Right.
And took it down to Ethiopia.

2580
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:16,630
Managing if it is something that,
some technological object from a 

2581
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:16,820
forgotten time,
you under it and go,

2582
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:18,050
oh yeah,
you know,

2583
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:23,720
what,
stop do you remember?

2584
02:07:24,211 --> 02:07:25,190
Um,
there was,

2585
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:29,780
there was some work that was done on 
ancient batteries where they've,

2586
02:07:29,790 --> 02:07:31,600
uh,
they believe that some,

2587
02:07:31,601 --> 02:07:36,601
some of the artifacts they found like 
egyptian pyramids perhaps might have 

2588
02:07:36,601 --> 02:07:36,601
functioned in

2589
02:07:36,601 --> 02:07:39,170
a very similar way to a modern battery.
I saw that.

2590
02:07:39,180 --> 02:07:39,580
Uh,
yeah.

2591
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:43,810
I mean it's possible I suppose.
And we,

2592
02:07:44,290 --> 02:07:45,970
again,
we talked about timescales.

2593
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:48,950
It's three and a half thousand for my 
fans and years.

2594
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:49,720
You know,
the,

2595
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:52,480
the earliest pyramids.
I think so.

2596
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:53,620
Um,
yeah,

2597
02:07:53,621 --> 02:07:54,640
we,
we don't know.

2598
02:07:54,670 --> 02:07:57,190
We know quite a lot about the,
the egyptians.

2599
02:07:57,490 --> 02:07:59,290
Again,
it's about human universe,

2600
02:07:59,300 --> 02:08:01,620
especially my monkey cage.
And I'll talk about giving university as

2601
02:08:01,621 --> 02:08:04,300
well because we,
we found um,

2602
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:09,600
my wife actually started learning.
Egyptians were just interested in 

2603
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,181
hieroglyphics.
She just got some classes and the 

2604
02:08:12,181 --> 02:08:13,060
literature from ancient Egypt is 
fascinating.

2605
02:08:13,061 --> 02:08:16,900
You're talking about three year,
2000 bc is things that have been written

2606
02:08:16,901 --> 02:08:21,130
down and the earliest I locked in,
I want it in the book of human universe,

2607
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:22,630
which you can get in the us,
I should say.

2608
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:23,680
I went into,
look,

2609
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:24,910
I want dailies literature.

2610
02:08:24,940 --> 02:08:27,400
What is it?
And it's basically the,

2611
02:08:27,430 --> 02:08:32,430
one of the earliest things I could find 
was basically monty python's parrot 

2612
02:08:32,430 --> 02:08:33,820
sketch because it's,
this is a complaint.

2613
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,160
And he said,
I wish to register a complaint.

2614
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:38,870
It's a piece of papaya,
iris.

2615
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:41,530
And it's a complaint about,
um,

2616
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:42,510
I think it was the,
the,

2617
02:08:42,511 --> 02:08:43,040
the,
the,

2618
02:08:43,041 --> 02:08:44,990
the coffin.
It was a,

2619
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:50,080
as a coffee manufacturer who had 
supplied this coffee and there was the 

2620
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:50,830
wrong size and it was kind of a bit of a
ripoff.

2621
02:08:50,860 --> 02:08:53,230
And this person said,
I'm complaining about this,

2622
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:55,060
I want to send it back.
This is terrible.

2623
02:08:55,061 --> 02:08:56,510
I want my money back.
And they'd say,

2624
02:08:56,511 --> 02:08:58,090
well,
you can have two coffIns instead.

2625
02:08:58,091 --> 02:08:59,830
And he,
I don't want a voucher.

2626
02:08:59,831 --> 02:09:03,370
I want my money.
And so you see this was wonderful,

2627
02:09:03,371 --> 02:09:07,710
is it's a modern voice that echoes down 
the ages from ancient Egypt that they,

2628
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,520
most of them are either admin.

2629
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:13,330
Things about my garden was nicked a bit 
of my garden.

2630
02:09:13,331 --> 02:09:15,700
You moved the fence in the night or 
something like that.

2631
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:18,230
All complaining about some piece of 
commerce like this is,

2632
02:09:18,340 --> 02:09:22,240
I've been ripped off by the shopkeeper 
and it's terrible and it's wonderful.

2633
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:25,240
But then they're also poems,
fantastic poems,

2634
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:30,280
there's one about a woman talking to her
husband and under the awareness,

2635
02:09:32,380 --> 02:09:34,800
the husband talking to him,
and so you go through and he's saying,

2636
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:36,970
why did you leave me?
Why didn't you love me?

2637
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:42,620
It's quite touch in a meeting.
And then you realize towards the end 

2638
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:42,620
that this,
this,

2639
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:42,620
this,
um,

2640
02:09:42,620 --> 02:09:44,260
woman died,
she's dead,

2641
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:48,820
but he's still talking to it like that 
because the egyptians thought that,

2642
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:50,710
you know,
she'd moved on,

2643
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:55,770
conscious,
a conscious decision to go into the 

2644
02:09:55,770 --> 02:09:58,591
afterlife.
And so there's this kind of bitterness 

2645
02:09:58,591 --> 02:10:01,290
being expressed and this really moving 
piece of poetry and then you realize 

2646
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:02,950
that it's 4,000
years old us,

2647
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,900
you know,
it's wonderful actually.

2648
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:07,930
So you found,
we haven't changed at the point that you

2649
02:10:07,931 --> 02:10:10,250
find from this old literature,
what will the,

2650
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:15,300
one of the oldest pieces of human 
language was the cuneiform right from 

2651
02:10:15,330 --> 02:10:17,920
somewhere?
I read this one thing that was,

2652
02:10:18,190 --> 02:10:21,340
there was a passage they were talking 
about that was about divorce.

2653
02:10:21,730 --> 02:10:23,830
Yeah,
iT was about marriage and divorce.

2654
02:10:23,890 --> 02:10:25,660
There was something along like,
um,

2655
02:10:26,110 --> 02:10:31,110
uh,
I forget what it was like a sort of a 

2656
02:10:31,110 --> 02:10:33,860
very short poem about divorce,
about marriage

2657
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,270
and uh,
you know,

2658
02:10:36,050 --> 02:10:40,220
for your relief or for your pleasure.
Divorce was very bizarre,

2659
02:10:40,221 --> 02:10:45,221
like the concept of two people uniting 
by ritual existed six,

2660
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:47,360
whatever,
five,

2661
02:10:47,361 --> 02:10:52,361
6,000
years ago and they wrote about it in 

2662
02:10:52,361 --> 02:10:53,490
these little scratches,
you know,

2663
02:10:53,491 --> 02:10:58,491
the,
the cuneiform which looks like ancient 

2664
02:10:58,491 --> 02:11:00,671
nails with a flat top and a that points 
down and then a certain pattern they've 

2665
02:11:01,221 --> 02:11:03,890
been able to figure out that it means 
some form,

2666
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:08,920
some language that you can kind of 
attempt to translate to our modern 

2667
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,160
languages in a weird,
clunky,

2668
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:11,810
you know,
have you ever read like Russia,

2669
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:15,530
like the russian translations from 
russian to english.

2670
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:19,130
It's so bizarre because their language 
is so alien to us.

2671
02:11:19,131 --> 02:11:24,131
It's so different that the way they use 
pronouns and the subtext and all the 

2672
02:11:24,131 --> 02:11:28,710
different aspects that we sort of take 
for granted about language don't 

2673
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:29,140
translate correctly.
Yeah.

2674
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:34,290
Yeah.
And you think you mentioned that 

2675
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:34,290
hieroglyphics.

2676
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:38,700
Yeah.
Could I like the fact that the voice is 

2677
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:41,210
so familiar.
We haven't changed the library of 

2678
02:11:41,210 --> 02:11:44,441
alexandria man,
the burning of the library of 

2679
02:11:44,441 --> 02:11:45,260
alexandria,
if we had never taken place and we could

2680
02:11:45,261 --> 02:11:50,261
somehow or another go back and read all 
the shit that they knew about 

2681
02:11:50,261 --> 02:11:54,431
construction methods and how they built 
those things and what was the purpose 

2682
02:11:54,431 --> 02:11:58,391
behind them and what was the 
significance of the astronaut 

2683
02:11:58,391 --> 02:11:59,250
astrological alignment.
Like what,

2684
02:11:59,260 --> 02:12:00,380
what were they doing,
why were they,

2685
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:06,150
what they were doing was so insane in 
comparison to the greater some of 

2686
02:12:06,861 --> 02:12:09,200
humanity.
Like if you look at humans,

2687
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:12,110
2,500
bc and then you look at Egypt,

2688
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:14,330
you like jesus christ.
What the fuck happened here?

2689
02:12:14,510 --> 02:12:19,510
How did you guys figure this shit out 
that no one else anywhere near w w was 

2690
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,680
anywhere close to this level of 
sophistication.

2691
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:26,930
Modern construction.
The second thing you can take from this,

2692
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:31,960
because if you look at ancient Egypt,
so of course if you go to some of the 

2693
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:33,950
temples down there on denial and look,
so in particular,

2694
02:12:33,951 --> 02:12:35,900
it's just astonishing achievement.

2695
02:12:36,280 --> 02:12:37,760
I you that.
You look at Greece,

2696
02:12:37,790 --> 02:12:42,790
you look at the greek literature,
and then you look at the library of 

2697
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:42,800
alexandria,
which the knowledge was lost because the

2698
02:12:42,801 --> 02:12:47,801
barbarians came and burn the thing down 
and you realize that civilizations rise 

2699
02:12:47,801 --> 02:12:50,990
and fall and knowledge can be lost,
and the the,

2700
02:12:50,991 --> 02:12:52,580
the,
the romans,

2701
02:12:52,581 --> 02:12:55,610
I suspect though they were eternal as a 
civilization,

2702
02:12:55,611 --> 02:12:57,440
they were continuing to progress the 
greeks before.

2703
02:12:57,441 --> 02:12:59,720
they haven't felt that.
The egyptians thought that they didn't.

2704
02:13:00,220 --> 02:13:04,970
we think that now,
and it's interesting to reflect,

2705
02:13:04,971 --> 02:13:07,550
I think on the fact that you don't have 
to make progress.

2706
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:11,750
The progress is in your own hands so you
can choose to make progress.

2707
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:15,140
They didn't choose to make progress for 
various reasons.

2708
02:13:15,141 --> 02:13:20,141
They stopped making progress and they 
vanished and knowledge vantage with a 

2709
02:13:20,141 --> 02:13:21,350
lot of the time and I think it's a 
lesson for us.

2710
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,430
We could do that.
You know,

2711
02:13:22,431 --> 02:13:27,431
we,
we just maybe we've got into this 

2712
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:27,431
position now with our technology were 
just,

2713
02:13:27,431 --> 02:13:29,510
it just won't go like that,
but only we can take it for granted.

2714
02:13:29,930 --> 02:13:32,370
Which I think goes back to right back to
the start of the conversation

2715
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:34,770
about how do we,
how do we say to people,

2716
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:35,540
you know,
the,

2717
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:40,550
the,
this is a remarkable thing that we've 

2718
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,550
done,
but it don't take it for granted.

2719
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:44,661
He's not just going to tick along while 
you guys sit there and watch sports all 

2720
02:13:44,661 --> 02:13:44,661
the time,
right?

2721
02:13:44,661 --> 02:13:46,380
That's not the way that you make 
progress.

2722
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:49,850
Somebody got to do something and we've 
all got to support the people.

2723
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:55,070
Even if you don't want to do it,
then support the people that want to do 

2724
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:55,070
it.
So you look at the,

2725
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,040
you know,
I was,

2726
02:13:56,100 --> 02:14:01,100
I was filming with them on friday for a 
thing I'm doing in britain with a rusty 

2727
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:04,690
spigot who's an apollo nine c test flu,
the lunar module and apollo nine in 

2728
02:14:04,690 --> 02:14:08,781
1968.
First test flight of it in earth orbit 

2729
02:14:08,781 --> 02:14:10,020
before they went to the moon in july of 
that year.

2730
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,700
And um,
and uh,

2731
02:14:12,990 --> 02:14:17,620
so he,
we landed on the moon actually in India.

2732
02:14:17,650 --> 02:14:22,650
We were in a simulator is terrific and 
he showed me how to do it and it's 

2733
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:22,650
fantastic.
But you look at nasa,

2734
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:27,500
the investment in nasa at that time,
it was never more than four percent of 

2735
02:14:27,500 --> 02:14:28,470
the federal expenditure and actually it 
was often less than that,

2736
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:30,750
so it wasn't particularly expensive on 
average,

2737
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:32,700
maybe about three percent of federal 
expenditure,

2738
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:38,210
but it laid the foundation I could argue
for american technological dominance in 

2739
02:14:38,210 --> 02:14:41,100
the last quarter of the 20th century 
because for example,

2740
02:14:41,150 --> 02:14:46,150
the,
the average age of the engineers in the 

2741
02:14:46,150 --> 02:14:47,520
nasa mission control when apollo 11 
landed on the moon was below 30,

2742
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:50,190
below 30 years old.
Those engineers.

2743
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,620
So what happened to them after the 
apollo program,

2744
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:56,070
they went out to work for boeing and you
know,

2745
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:01,520
microsoft bell labs,
bell labs or lockheed martin or whoever 

2746
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:01,520
it is,
all these people.

2747
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:07,060
So you get this explosion in,
in technological achievement,

2748
02:15:07,111 --> 02:15:12,070
in economic growth in America is a 
terrific place to be a because in,

2749
02:15:12,071 --> 02:15:17,071
in many ways because of the growth that 
happened in those 30 or 40 years since 

2750
02:15:17,071 --> 02:15:17,880
apollo and,
and,

2751
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:21,240
but that was because of a conscious 
investment led by,

2752
02:15:21,241 --> 02:15:23,190
you know,
kennedy's great speech and also inspired

2753
02:15:23,191 --> 02:15:24,390
by the cold war,
et cetera.

2754
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:28,440
There's many reasons why I did it,
but ultimately that investment paid vast

2755
02:15:28,441 --> 02:15:33,441
dividends.
You look at nasa today and the 

2756
02:15:33,441 --> 02:15:36,081
investment is way down,
so the ambition that the America had to 

2757
02:15:36,091 --> 02:15:39,480
go to the moon because it's there and to
beat the russians yet,

2758
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:44,360
but to do it and then that ambition 
seems to be missing to me and I looked,

2759
02:15:44,361 --> 02:15:44,800
I,
I,

2760
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:50,090
I looked to this country actually 
because I think it is the country know 

2761
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:50,210
the country could have done that.
They get no,

2762
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:52,680
the country could.
Gun moon will go.

2763
02:15:52,770 --> 02:15:57,660
I think before this decade is out,
we'll go and they hadn't flown anyone in

2764
02:15:57,661 --> 02:15:59,910
space.
When kennedy made that speech,

2765
02:16:00,060 --> 02:16:02,250
you hadn't flown anyone in space and you
say,

2766
02:16:02,251 --> 02:16:03,720
within 10 years I'm going to walk on the
moon.

2767
02:16:03,870 --> 02:16:08,870
That's an american thing to do.
I think this is part of what's great 

2768
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:12,141
about this country and I regret the fact
that that doesn't seem to be there at 

2769
02:16:12,141 --> 02:16:15,411
the moment,
and going back to why I started saying 

2770
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:15,411
that the,
the,

2771
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:18,180
the idea that progress is progress is 
comes to the bold,

2772
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:18,420
right?

2773
02:16:18,420 --> 02:16:20,820
I would say so the idea that it will 
just come,

2774
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:24,360
they will just make progress and is not 
necessarily right.

2775
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:25,800
In fact,
history tells us it's wrong,

2776
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:31,040
so you've got to have,
I believe bold visions and visionary 

2777
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,500
leaders and leaders are just say,
well,

2778
02:16:32,740 --> 02:16:35,260
this is not a great deflection of 
resources.

2779
02:16:35,470 --> 02:16:36,250
It was,
as I say,

2780
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:39,850
it was always less than three,
four percent of federal expenditure,

2781
02:16:40,270 --> 02:16:45,270
but it's a great reflection of national 
will and it's a great generator of fsc,

2782
02:16:45,490 --> 02:16:50,490
of engineers and scientists who are 
inspired by those things and trained in 

2783
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:54,781
that process.
That guy into the economy make the 

2784
02:16:54,781 --> 02:16:56,641
economy better.
There's a study that suggested it was a 

2785
02:16:56,641 --> 02:16:59,821
14 to one return on every dollar 
invested in apollo by 1980 and people 

2786
02:17:00,191 --> 02:17:03,850
can argue about the um,
the 10 to was 14 to one.

2787
02:17:03,851 --> 02:17:08,851
Was it 22?
One is the return to the private sector 

2788
02:17:08,851 --> 02:17:09,630
or return to the government that gdp 
into,

2789
02:17:09,670 --> 02:17:12,290
in just into wealth generated.

2790
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:17,600
So,
so each one made tang each one of those 

2791
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,260
dollars generating at least 10 and maybe
20 in a decade.

2792
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:25,320
And it's obvious how it did it.
Because look at those young engineers 

2793
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:26,590
and look at the technologies that were 
developed for a follow.

2794
02:17:26,740 --> 02:17:29,230
Someone said to me at nasa ames up in 
san francisco,

2795
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:34,440
virtually virtually every technology and
commercial aviation today got invented 

2796
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:37,930
there in at nasa ames.
Actually most of it,

2797
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:40,030
so,
so you can point to one place and go,

2798
02:17:40,130 --> 02:17:45,130
that's where everything I take for 
granted when I get in an aircraft came 

2799
02:17:45,130 --> 02:17:47,300
from that almost directly.
Do you think it's because of the,

2800
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:52,320
the,
the ending of the cold war or the lack 

2801
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:52,320
of competition with Russia?
There's.

2802
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,860
We were on top,
so we just got soft.

2803
02:17:53,861 --> 02:17:56,020
There was no need to keep pushing and 
pressing.

2804
02:17:56,170 --> 02:18:01,170
There wasn't an adversary.
There wasn't this technological 

2805
02:18:01,170 --> 02:18:04,171
adversary that's out there that gives 
people the motivation to continue to 

2806
02:18:04,171 --> 02:18:04,171
invest.

2807
02:18:04,171 --> 02:18:05,870
Forty percent of the gross domestic 
product or whatever,

2808
02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:07,100
you know,
whatever the.

2809
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:10,840
The amount of money we need.
I don't know.

2810
02:18:10,841 --> 02:18:13,120
It seems.
I have to look at britain,

2811
02:18:13,150 --> 02:18:17,590
so I talk about my country,
which did the big thing around the world

2812
02:18:17,591 --> 02:18:20,230
and then declined.
It doesn't run the world anymore.

2813
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:22,660
Handed it over to you guys.
You guys had a little island.

2814
02:18:22,661 --> 02:18:24,220
He ran it out of an island.
It's pretty dope.

2815
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,830
Yeah.
We have a big ass continent.

2816
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:30,190
We set off in the wrong place.
Did it out of Rhode Island.

2817
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:34,130
It's kind of smaller than California.
Yeah,

2818
02:18:34,230 --> 02:18:36,550
it was pretty crazy for awhile.
not bad,

2819
02:18:36,770 --> 02:18:40,820
but it seems to me that what we lack is 
the.

2820
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:42,760
These things are not expensive.
In fact,

2821
02:18:42,761 --> 02:18:44,650
they're vital.
They generate money,

2822
02:18:44,910 --> 02:18:49,910
so it seems to me it's leadership.
It's visionary leadership by 

2823
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:50,620
inspiration.
Yeah,

2824
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:52,480
and it doesn't take it well.

2825
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:53,960
I was gonna say it doesn't take much 
clear.

2826
02:18:53,970 --> 02:18:55,770
It took a kennedy,
I think.

2827
02:18:55,771 --> 02:18:57,430
I mean that speech.
He's a remarkable speech.

2828
02:18:57,490 --> 02:19:02,490
Rallies a nation beyond something,
but it's not a particularly large 

2829
02:19:02,490 --> 02:19:04,350
diversion of resources.
That's the point and certainly given the

2830
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:07,080
what you get back,
it seems to me the investment in r and d

2831
02:19:07,081 --> 02:19:12,081
in science and technology and education,
these are the things that formed the 

2832
02:19:12,081 --> 02:19:12,370
foundation of our future.
Absolutely.

2833
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:14,800
And everybody agrees with that and I get
very involved.

2834
02:19:14,801 --> 02:19:18,010
I get involved in politics in britain,
but not party politics,

2835
02:19:18,011 --> 02:19:21,370
but this lobbying for this,
spend money on the young,

2836
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,820
spend money on education system,
spend money on inspiration,

2837
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:30,030
make sure that there's a generation of 
these great engineers and scientists 

2838
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:33,140
that America is currently well leading 
in.

2839
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:34,750
Absolutely.
um,

2840
02:19:35,210 --> 02:19:37,160
and make sure that they're still there 
and make sure.

2841
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,120
And how do you get them?

2842
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:43,120
How do you inspire them?
I don't want kids to want to be a 

2843
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:43,670
singer's actually,
particularly annex x factor.

2844
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:48,671
I don't want them to be famed.
When there was a survey done recently I 

2845
02:19:48,671 --> 02:19:48,671
think where they said to the lower 
school kids what you want to be when you

2846
02:19:48,671 --> 02:19:49,520
grow up and,
and,

2847
02:19:49,550 --> 02:19:51,080
and a lot of them said,
famous,

2848
02:19:51,800 --> 02:19:53,840
famous.
What do you mean famous?

2849
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:55,760
You want to walk on the moon?
Don't you want to.

2850
02:19:55,761 --> 02:19:58,170
Do you want to invent the world's 
fastest computer?

2851
02:19:58,171 --> 02:20:00,170
Don't do you want it?
What do you mean famous?

2852
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:05,200
You've got to be famous for something 
not famous because you want a talent 

2853
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:05,200
show.
We go back to the pole.

2854
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:09,560
Can kardashians?
I'd never seen the cardassians by the 

2855
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:11,831
way.
I don't know who the hell they are and 

2856
02:20:11,831 --> 02:20:11,831
thank god I don't because I don't know.
We don't,

2857
02:20:11,831 --> 02:20:12,590
I don't think we have them in britain 
that maybe we do,

2858
02:20:12,591 --> 02:20:13,490
but they get over there.

2859
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:14,510
Do they get over that?
We'd done it,

2860
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:16,190
I'm sure,
but I want to pick on that lot.

2861
02:20:16,220 --> 02:20:17,420
I mean they're doing what they do.
Right.

2862
02:20:17,421 --> 02:20:21,800
But the point is you don't want to be 
one of those without being disrespect.

2863
02:20:21,801 --> 02:20:23,680
Maybe they,
they're having a good time,

2864
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:29,470
find insult people and then at the same 
time people kind make their make their 

2865
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:30,010
way,
you know,

2866
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:32,550
and do well and they're not criminals.
They're not evil people.

2867
02:20:32,660 --> 02:20:37,660
They're not.
Those is what do you want to aspire to 

2868
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:37,660
be as,
as a kid?

2869
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:38,840
What do you want to aspire to be?
And it's true.

2870
02:20:38,841 --> 02:20:40,940
They're in their sixties.
They wanted it to be neil armstrong,

2871
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:46,270
uh,
or one of the engineers in mission 

2872
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:46,270
control.
And that's a government government has.

2873
02:20:46,270 --> 02:20:47,520
I know it's kind of unfashionable in 
some circles,

2874
02:20:47,720 --> 02:20:50,630
but government sets the,
sets the direction in the,

2875
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,570
it has to.

2876
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:53,540
It's,
you know,

2877
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:56,930
companies can do it as well.
So you have the big companies like apple

2878
02:20:56,931 --> 02:21:00,230
and google and so people do aspire to 
work with those companies,

2879
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:05,410
but I think the grand direction of 
civilization is set by set by 

2880
02:21:05,410 --> 02:21:08,660
governments and visionaries and and,
and it's not expensive,

2881
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:10,850
but it's terrifically expensive not to 
do it.

2882
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:16,240
For governmenTs to the idea of 
government is really been hijacked in 

2883
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,720
this country and come apart.
Money being catalytic,

2884
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:19,690
I don't know.
You know,

2885
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:21,920
it depends what you mean by government 
and big government,

2886
02:21:21,921 --> 02:21:24,210
small government,
special interest groups and the

2887
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:28,050
law.
Like it's just too much money involved.

2888
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:33,080
The complaints being there's legal,
like absolutely legal corruption in this

2889
02:21:34,471 --> 02:21:39,471
country.
Like we're giant corporations are 

2890
02:21:39,471 --> 02:21:42,801
allowed to invest enormous sums of money
into candidates that will,

2891
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:46,920
once they get into office,
you do the bidding of these corporations

2892
02:21:46,921 --> 02:21:48,720
manipulate laws,
move things around,

2893
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:51,720
make things easier for these 
corporations to manipulate our society.

2894
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,540
That's a realIty and that's very 
unfortunate.

2895
02:21:54,541 --> 02:21:59,541
But I think that's a reality that's also
being a roading or eroding rather by 

2896
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:03,891
technology.
I think people understanding the 

2897
02:22:03,891 --> 02:22:06,501
mechanisms involved in government is 
making them want to change those 

2898
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:08,640
mechanisms.
People pushing for ideas lIke being able

2899
02:22:08,641 --> 02:22:13,641
to vote online.
This is like people were really 

2900
02:22:13,641 --> 02:22:15,270
frustrated by this oil.
How come I can bank online?

2901
02:22:15,480 --> 02:22:20,480
how come you can deal with the entire 
world's economy through computers and 

2902
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:20,480
the internet,
but you can't vote?

2903
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:24,420
How come is it because you don't want it
to be that easy for people to give their

2904
02:22:24,421 --> 02:22:26,310
opinion,
people to vote because

2905
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:30,510
the world of the internet and the world 
of of actual voting there too,

2906
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:35,520
there's a big gap between them.
There's a big gap that would instantly 

2907
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:38,360
shift right over if you were allowed to 
vote online and these people this,

2908
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:39,690
oh,
there's problems with that.

2909
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:40,530
Oh,
corruption,

2910
02:22:40,531 --> 02:22:45,531
oh this.
Or you're the one who's always worried 

2911
02:22:45,531 --> 02:22:45,531
about hacking.
Well,

2912
02:22:45,531 --> 02:22:45,531
guess what?
That's going to be the case.

2913
02:22:45,531 --> 02:22:46,460
No matter what you do,
there's goIng to.

2914
02:22:46,500 --> 02:22:49,470
There's all sorts of problems with 
voting the conventional way.

2915
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:54,680
I mean America,
we've had giant scandals and diebold 

2916
02:22:54,680 --> 02:22:56,610
voting machines that contained the third
party access,

2917
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:59,700
the ability to manipulate the data.
It's all been proven.

2918
02:22:59,701 --> 02:23:04,701
There was a documentary called hacking 
democracy that showed how ludicrous it 

2919
02:23:04,701 --> 02:23:07,290
is to think that our system that's in 
place right now is is infallible,

2920
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:08,250
not,
not only that,

2921
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:13,251
it's massively flawed.
The technology that exists because of 

2922
02:23:13,511 --> 02:23:18,511
the internet,
because of the ability to exchange 

2923
02:23:18,511 --> 02:23:19,140
information instantaneously with each 
other is unprecedented,

2924
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:23,790
and I think that is going to shift the 
idea of government that's going to shit.

2925
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:28,790
It's going to scatter all these crazy 
people that are running things right 

2926
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:30,180
now.
It's not going to be viable anymore.

2927
02:23:30,181 --> 02:23:35,181
just like kings aren't viable anymore.
You can't be henry the eighth in 2015 

2928
02:23:35,181 --> 02:23:36,990
unless you're the guy in North Korea.
He's like the last one,

2929
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:42,290
but most.
Most governments can't be run the way 

2930
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:44,610
they were run thousands of years ago.
There's too much access to information.

2931
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,610
We know you're not a god.
We know you're just a person.

2932
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:48,410
You know,
we,

2933
02:23:48,450 --> 02:23:53,450
we,
we have this ability to exchange these 

2934
02:23:53,450 --> 02:23:55,350
ideas so quickly that the word gets out 
too fast.

2935
02:23:55,690 --> 02:24:00,690
You're listening to tim.
Ben is lee when he talks about the 

2936
02:24:00,690 --> 02:24:01,380
worldwide web and eventually by the way 
it said,

2937
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:05,580
of course the web bits of it,
and then then he talks in those terms.

2938
02:24:05,581 --> 02:24:10,581
Actually he's quite idealistic and 
honestly I am a freedom of information 

2939
02:24:11,281 --> 02:24:13,350
free exchange of information and I think
you're right.

2940
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:15,570
I mean it goes right back to the 
beginning of the conversation,

2941
02:24:15,571 --> 02:24:18,420
doesn't it is a good thing or a bad 
thing on the web.

2942
02:24:18,500 --> 02:24:23,500
Let's say a good thing or a bad thing 
and you must be right in this sentence 

2943
02:24:23,500 --> 02:24:26,481
that they,
as long as people you know you need to 

2944
02:24:26,481 --> 02:24:29,160
set and we're having this conversation 
at quite a high level.

2945
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:34,180
if you know we're talking about great 
movements and great shifts in 

2946
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:36,540
civilization and so I suppose you need 
a.

2947
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:40,140
You need the perspective first.
Don't you need the.

2948
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:45,240
You need your appetite stimulating for 
knowledge and information and to use not

2949
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:48,090
to use the internet or the web to get to
as yourself,

2950
02:24:48,150 --> 02:24:53,150
you need to have some instinct that I'm 
not going to just go find the little 

2951
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:56,691
sliver of information that interests me 
and perhaps inflammation that's 

2952
02:24:56,691 --> 02:24:57,250
nonsensical and is also the,
you know,

2953
02:24:57,270 --> 02:25:02,270
how you you can go and be a conspiracy 
theorist and find plenty of information 

2954
02:25:02,270 --> 02:25:05,811
to support your conspiracy.
He will see that tool kit so you can 

2955
02:25:05,811 --> 02:25:06,180
always talks about this in the demon 
haunted world.

2956
02:25:06,181 --> 02:25:08,100
Again,
by giving people a toolkit.

2957
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:09,800
Bullshit detectors,
I think he called it,

2958
02:25:09,801 --> 02:25:12,180
you know,
the education science,

2959
02:25:12,210 --> 02:25:16,560
the scientific method that that's a 
bullshit detector kit basically.

2960
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:19,220
So if you can get that in there,
you can get that in.

2961
02:25:19,230 --> 02:25:21,600
Maybe this is the priority really in 
schools to say,

2962
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:24,250
well,
I want you to know how to think,

2963
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:27,490
how to look information,
assess where the information came from,

2964
02:25:27,660 --> 02:25:32,500
understanding if it's likely to be 
tainted or biased or good or bad,

2965
02:25:32,501 --> 02:25:36,460
or how do I assess this vast quantity 
information out there?

2966
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:38,110
How do I not get it?
Whereas myself,

2967
02:25:38,200 --> 02:25:40,480
how do I decide that I'm only going to 
read,

2968
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:44,170
I'm only going to is the external forums
that say that we didn't land on the moon

2969
02:25:44,171 --> 02:25:46,420
and there was a big conspiracy and 
everyone covered it up.

2970
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:49,210
How?
How can I broaden my reach to say,

2971
02:25:49,211 --> 02:25:54,211
is that really true?
Shall I check some other stuff like the 

2972
02:25:54,211 --> 02:25:57,030
telescopes?
That way you can look at the spacecraft 

2973
02:25:57,030 --> 02:25:57,030
on the moon,
you know that kind of bits of evidence.

2974
02:25:57,310 --> 02:26:02,310
So I think that's very important.
Isn't it ironic that in this day and age

2975
02:26:02,861 --> 02:26:07,861
we accumulate more data.
I think there was some statistic about 

2976
02:26:07,861 --> 02:26:10,630
in every two days we accumulate more 
data,

2977
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:15,660
more like numbers and a lot of it's 
probably instagram pictures and twitter 

2978
02:26:15,660 --> 02:26:19,270
and shit that's useless,
but that more hard data gets accumulated

2979
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:22,990
or processed or or or produced by humans
today.

2980
02:26:23,170 --> 02:26:27,640
Then the entire time of human history up
to that point,

2981
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:30,520
which is fucking staggering.
Yeah,

2982
02:26:30,550 --> 02:26:35,550
but it also,
most of it takes place on computers.

2983
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:41,160
The most of it is ones and zeros.
Most of it takes place in a language 

2984
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:44,730
that you.
And I can't even read if it was written 

2985
02:26:44,730 --> 02:26:44,730
on a piece of paper,
no one.

2986
02:26:44,730 --> 02:26:48,150
And it's a big subject.
And how do you use data and how do we 

2987
02:26:48,150 --> 02:26:48,150
use it?
There's.

2988
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:52,180
There's an example that the program I do
in the uk called stargazing live.

2989
02:26:52,210 --> 02:26:55,330
She'll live astronomy show on the bbc 
and lots of people watch it.

2990
02:26:55,331 --> 02:27:00,331
It's kind of people like it.
One of the things that we do a citizen 

2991
02:27:00,331 --> 02:27:03,190
science projects,
so for example last year that we use the

2992
02:27:03,191 --> 02:27:06,730
european space agency's database of 
photographs of the surface of mars.

2993
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:09,130
Nobody's ever looked at them,
right?

2994
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:09,850
There's too many of them.

2995
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
So we've got too many pitches of miles,
no one know human eyes have ever looked 

2996
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,631
at these pictures.
So we ran a project where we wanted to 

2997
02:27:18,631 --> 02:27:22,141
answer a question about some features 
that we're seeing moving across the 

2998
02:27:22,141 --> 02:27:26,101
surface of mars,
weather features that we thought may be 

2999
02:27:26,101 --> 02:27:30,181
seasonal.
So maybe in the martian winter they 

3000
02:27:30,181 --> 02:27:30,181
moved down to the equator.
Let me back up again in the summer.

3001
02:27:30,181 --> 02:27:34,260
Didn't know.
Then we proved that they were indeed 

3002
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:36,751
seasonal by getting millions of people 
who watched the program to go look at 

3003
02:27:36,751 --> 02:27:40,861
the pictures for the first time so you 
can go online now and look at pictures 

3004
02:27:40,861 --> 02:27:44,611
of mars.
Let's saY that nobody's ever seen it 

3005
02:27:44,611 --> 02:27:46,120
because it's too much data,
even the of the planet,

3006
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:50,170
so imagine the amount of data generated 
on this planet that no one's ever done,

3007
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:55,560
that no one's ever looked at this date.
They'll be data about what a increases 

3008
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:57,280
the likelihood of certain cancers.
For example,

3009
02:27:57,370 --> 02:28:02,370
there'll be the lifestyle that does that
doesn't engender that alone will be 

3010
02:28:02,370 --> 02:28:04,750
there in the data,
but no one's quite got their head around

3011
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:08,410
now to go and mine that data and try to 
use it.

3012
02:28:08,460 --> 02:28:13,460
It just.
Using the data is extremely difficult 

3013
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:13,460
and challenging,
but you're right,

3014
02:28:13,460 --> 02:28:17,701
it's there.
No one ever looks at it will not only 

3015
02:28:17,701 --> 02:28:20,791
that,
the idea of somehow or another 

3016
02:28:20,791 --> 02:28:22,300
preserving this,
if there was some event super volcano

3017
02:28:22,300 --> 02:28:27,300
eruption,
like they're constantly worried about 

3018
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:27,300
yellowstone and there's one in 
Indonesia,

3019
02:28:27,300 --> 02:28:29,810
I believe it is,
that they believe is connected to a mass

3020
02:28:29,811 --> 02:28:33,020
extinction event that killed off a giant
swath of the population.

3021
02:28:33,060 --> 02:28:33,750
Oh,
they're nasty.

3022
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:37,670
They're the super volcanoes.
Terrifying one of those to go and if one

3023
02:28:37,671 --> 02:28:42,671
of those hits and somehow or another,
the power goes out all around the world 

3024
02:28:42,671 --> 02:28:45,080
and the only people that survive are 
those folks that live by the volcano.

3025
02:28:45,410 --> 02:28:48,050
Fuck man.
We're starting from scratch.

3026
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:51,050
Like I mean relatively in terms of the 
universe.

3027
02:28:51,051 --> 02:28:53,270
That's nothing.
So you big baby.

3028
02:28:53,390 --> 02:28:58,390
You got to wait another 10,000
years civilization to reemerge and 

3029
02:28:58,390 --> 02:28:59,970
someone to reinvent the internet,
you know,

3030
02:28:59,990 --> 02:29:04,990
and the ark of the covenant and still 
locked up in Ethiopia because they 

3031
02:29:04,990 --> 02:29:08,231
already did this and they already 
figured out how to make nuclear bomb or 

3032
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:08,231
something like that.

3033
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:08,490
When those the fuck it is.
But the,

3034
02:29:08,580 --> 02:29:09,350
the,
the.

3035
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:14,620
For our immediate life,
it's so critical to not just acquire 

3036
02:29:14,620 --> 02:29:16,310
this information,
but to nurture it and to spread it.

3037
02:29:16,311 --> 02:29:17,390
I mean,
that's your whole idea,

3038
02:29:17,391 --> 02:29:17,670
right?
You're,

3039
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:21,740
you're just talking about expanding 
science and education and getting people

3040
02:29:21,741 --> 02:29:24,650
excited and involved,
but that doesn't mean jack shit.

3041
02:29:24,651 --> 02:29:29,651
If The fucking earth spits out a giant 
ball of lava that engulfs half of north 

3042
02:29:29,651 --> 02:29:32,030
America and that kills 90 percent of the
planet,

3043
02:29:32,210 --> 02:29:34,640
like we're starting from scratch and 
there's not.

3044
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:37,070
None of this is going to be any good.
No computers,

3045
02:29:37,071 --> 02:29:38,750
no hard drives,
no flash drives,

3046
02:29:38,751 --> 02:29:40,580
no fucking database.
It's all bullshit.

3047
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:43,190
The cloud go fuck your cloud.
It's not really in the cloud.

3048
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:45,530
I've got news for you.
It's down on earth and oh,

3049
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,490
it's in the cloud.
No,

3050
02:29:46,491 --> 02:29:47,810
it's not.
There's no cloud.

3051
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,340
Okay.
It doesn't exist.

3052
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:51,470
You go up and look around for your 
fucking data.

3053
02:29:51,500 --> 02:29:54,780
It's not there in someone's goddamn 
building.

3054
02:29:54,930 --> 02:29:56,540
Okay?
It's a fucking building.

3055
02:29:56,690 --> 02:30:00,050
Stop saying it's in the cloud because 
it's not a dirty,

3056
02:30:00,051 --> 02:30:00,920
stinky,
live.

3057
02:30:03,170 --> 02:30:08,170
That's reality.
Unless you're launching that fucking 

3058
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:11,231
shit up,
it would have taken all the hard drives 

3059
02:30:11,231 --> 02:30:11,840
of all the world and launching it into 
space and you know,

3060
02:30:11,910 --> 02:30:13,640
on a 10,000
year loop.

3061
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:16,300
So it comes back around and lands to,
you know,

3062
02:30:16,470 --> 02:30:21,470
you do it.
90 nine point nine percent of the speed 

3063
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:21,610
of light.
So the data you're getting back again,

3064
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:27,070
it comes back.
Could you imagine if that's what happens

3065
02:30:28,491 --> 02:30:32,630
like one day just they do,
they pick a strategic location that they

3066
02:30:32,631 --> 02:30:36,680
believe will be a large population of 
life and it really lands 10,000

3067
02:30:36,681 --> 02:30:38,750
years later and we go,
oh fuck,

3068
02:30:38,780 --> 02:30:43,780
look at this.
Look at all the shIt they knew and it's 

3069
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:46,270
all in dos or whatever.
Some something that we could read like 

3070
02:30:46,270 --> 02:30:49,600
fairly easily.
They run it through some computers and 

3071
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:49,600
they realized like,
wow,

3072
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:50,000
fucking people been around.
Do you remember my first,

3073
02:30:50,001 --> 02:30:51,550
my first operating system on a pc?

3074
02:30:51,550 --> 02:30:55,360
There's dust five.
Remember that I was postdoc.

3075
02:30:56,130 --> 02:31:01,130
The first computer that I ever had had 
windows 95 and windows 95 was the big 

3076
02:31:01,551 --> 02:31:06,551
deal.
My friend chris made computers with 

3077
02:31:06,551 --> 02:31:09,110
windows three point two,
three point one when she ran on dust.

3078
02:31:09,120 --> 02:31:09,590
So.
So I,

3079
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:14,591
yeah,
I had no windows when I first got my 

3080
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:14,591
first pc.
Wow.

3081
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:14,591
Cool.
That's crazy.

3082
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:19,660
And if you think about how recent you 
kind of guy named matt on that.

3083
02:31:21,750 --> 02:31:22,340
Yeah,
right.

3084
02:31:22,410 --> 02:31:24,540
If someone sends you a picture,
it's way bigger than that.

3085
02:31:25,030 --> 02:31:26,190
Yeah.
Every fucking pictures.

3086
02:31:26,191 --> 02:31:27,110
100 million.
Right.

3087
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:32,590
And if you think that that was 1995,
it was only 20 years ago and in 20 years

3088
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,250
a blink of an eye,
you know,

3089
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:41,960
a blink of an eye.
I think we should get back to dos you 

3090
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:41,960
think?
Yeah.

3091
02:31:41,960 --> 02:31:46,190
Why?
Because you want to know that it 

3092
02:31:46,190 --> 02:31:46,190
competes.
It worked.

3093
02:31:46,190 --> 02:31:50,020
You got to,
you got to have these little also exec 

3094
02:31:50,020 --> 02:31:50,590
that files that designed the memory of.

3095
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:52,930
Isn't that like more work than you need,
isn't it?

3096
02:31:53,120 --> 02:31:54,560
It's a big deal in the sentence because 
we,

3097
02:31:54,610 --> 02:31:59,610
we have a problem with getting kids to 
write code because they'll think it's a 

3098
02:31:59,971 --> 02:32:01,680
lot of work to write code,
right?

3099
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:06,770
Yeah.
But like in the old days with the 

3100
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:08,151
computers,
you have friends that make video games 

3101
02:32:08,151 --> 02:32:10,140
and one of the most shocking things was 
the,

3102
02:32:10,141 --> 02:32:14,520
the sheer amount of hours that go into 
coding video games.

3103
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:16,950
You know,
the folks at id software,

3104
02:32:16,951 --> 02:32:20,090
they let me in behind the scenes and 
epic games to cliff.

3105
02:32:20,110 --> 02:32:25,110
He be our friend cliff.
He was on the podcast before I would 

3106
02:32:25,110 --> 02:32:28,491
watch those guys work.
They would do 16 hour days and they 

3107
02:32:28,491 --> 02:32:32,031
would just be coding and drinking 
fucking caffeine and just staring in 

3108
02:32:32,031 --> 02:32:35,580
front of these monitors and just running
over thousands of lines of code.

3109
02:32:35,581 --> 02:32:36,720
And you're like,
oh,

3110
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:38,820
that's how you make a fucking video 
game.

3111
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:42,560
It's kind of 100 million dollar.
Things are unbelievable.

3112
02:32:42,561 --> 02:32:43,620
They like movies.
Well,

3113
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:47,540
they're bigger than movies.
The average huge gambling,

3114
02:32:47,541 --> 02:32:48,780
uh,
grand theft auto.

3115
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:52,010
When those games get released,
they're there.

3116
02:32:52,050 --> 02:32:55,650
The amount of money that they generate 
Is rival to like avatar.

3117
02:32:55,651 --> 02:32:59,850
Some huge spectacular hit.
Like not an average movie,

3118
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:02,220
but it just gigantic,
monumental,

3119
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:07,280
epic,
huge successful movie that's like an 

3120
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,630
average video game.
Grand theft auto and madden.

3121
02:33:09,631 --> 02:33:12,870
When those madden games come out,
the fucking world changes.

3122
02:33:12,871 --> 02:33:17,871
Like I mean people generally,
there's so much income that gets poured 

3123
02:33:17,871 --> 02:33:21,231
into those video games and you realize 
that it's a lot of just people just 

3124
02:33:21,231 --> 02:33:23,991
coding because standing in front of 
computers and just pounding on a 

3125
02:33:23,991 --> 02:33:24,720
keyboard,
it's madness.

3126
02:33:25,180 --> 02:33:30,180
You know,
maybe that's the way that western 

3127
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:30,180
civilization falls.
The coders stopped,

3128
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:32,970
people stopped fucking going to happen.
They're going to stop breeding.

3129
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:34,110
That's just gonna happen.

3130
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:39,590
Women.
Women will stop having sex with motors 

3131
02:33:39,590 --> 02:33:41,040
and it's all going to fucking end all 
their accumulated knowledge that we were

3132
02:33:41,041 --> 02:33:44,220
talking about before.
Like the coders making children that are

3133
02:33:44,221 --> 02:33:45,570
better coders.
Nope.

3134
02:33:45,810 --> 02:33:49,080
Just ends one day.
Maybe you can wrIte four tran.

3135
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:54,440
Yeah.
One day we wake up and we realized that 

3136
02:33:54,440 --> 02:33:55,200
no one's making video games anymore.
So we go to these places where they made

3137
02:33:55,201 --> 02:33:55,950
video games.
So like,

3138
02:33:55,951 --> 02:33:58,710
hello,
everybody's dead cobwebs everywhere.

3139
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:01,730
They just died and no one fucked up the 
apocalypse.

3140
02:34:02,940 --> 02:34:04,260
No.
Well,

3141
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:09,290
imagine if computer coders ceased to 
exist and all of us were forced to back 

3142
02:34:10,291 --> 02:34:14,550
engineer computer code if today,
like for somehow or another,

3143
02:34:14,551 --> 02:34:19,551
I don't know how many people in this 
world have a deep understanding of 

3144
02:34:19,551 --> 02:34:21,430
computer operating systems or computer 
code,

3145
02:34:21,550 --> 02:34:26,550
but I couldn't imagine it's more than 
one percent and if we lost one percent 

3146
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:27,820
of the population just disappeared from 
the earth.

3147
02:34:28,030 --> 02:34:33,030
And then the rest of us dopes.
We're left to observe our cell phone 

3148
02:34:33,030 --> 02:34:35,170
crashing or fucking tri caster over 
here.

3149
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:40,350
That shit the bed on us mid broadcast.
I mean if that's a critical part of our,

3150
02:34:42,370 --> 02:34:46,870
our society of civilization itself and 
it totally overlooked.

3151
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:49,840
So you coders out there,
god bless,

3152
02:34:50,160 --> 02:34:52,000
keep breathing,
keep breathing,

3153
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:57,040
and breathing.
Breathing and breathing with the praise 

3154
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,600
odin for the coders.

3155
02:35:00,910 --> 02:35:02,780
It's amazing.
It's so amazing.

3156
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:07,830
If you really think of how much our life
in our civilization revolves around 

3157
02:35:08,170 --> 02:35:12,700
electronics and around computer code,
which you a monkey cage and essentially,

3158
02:35:12,701 --> 02:35:14,920
yes,
I mean it's stunning.

3159
02:35:15,130 --> 02:35:20,130
If you really stop and think about it,
every single thing that used to be 

3160
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:24,180
mechanical and a and an analog is now 
computer like cars.

3161
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:29,640
ThIs,
the main for car enthusiasts is one of 

3162
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:30,880
the main complaints is that you don't 
feel what a car is doing anymore.

3163
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:35,470
One of the thrIlls of driving an older 
car like especially in old sports car,

3164
02:35:35,471 --> 02:35:37,270
they're not as fast.
They don't handle as well,

3165
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:42,190
but you feel everything you feel the 
road because it's a mechanical steering.

3166
02:35:42,191 --> 02:35:47,191
There's no assisting.
Like if you go to like a 1973 porsche 

3167
02:35:47,191 --> 02:35:47,800
nine slash 11,
there's no.

3168
02:35:47,950 --> 02:35:50,110
There's no hydraulic assist in the 
steering.

3169
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:52,360
It's all mechanical.
you feel every pebble.

3170
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:56,200
You literally feel the mechanism turning
the tire.

3171
02:35:56,201 --> 02:36:01,201
You feel the tires losing their grip.
It's all transmitted through your seat 

3172
02:36:01,201 --> 02:36:01,990
and through your hands and people live 
for this.

3173
02:36:01,991 --> 02:36:05,380
It's like exciting stuff,
but if you drive a modern porsche,

3174
02:36:05,710 --> 02:36:10,710
it's like there's a million operations 
that are going on behind the scenes and 

3175
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:14,551
every second to avoid collisions and 
slow your tires down and breaking on the

3176
02:36:14,711 --> 02:36:16,530
right side because you're turning left.
I was like,

3177
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:18,820
all this shit that's going on that you 
don't even know.

3178
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:23,850
You don't even feel it.
There's a magnetic ride control system 

3179
02:36:23,850 --> 02:36:25,000
that's adjusting.
There's like there's certain cars now,

3180
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:30,120
like I believe mercedes benz has a 
camera that looks at the road in front 

3181
02:36:30,161 --> 02:36:34,570
of you and gauges whether or not the 
suspension should be compliant or rigid.

3182
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:38,650
It adjusts and you can go,
I think up to like 30 miles an hour.

3183
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:42,160
You just take your hand off the wheel 
and put it in cruise control and fucking

3184
02:36:42,161 --> 02:36:47,161
turns based on the lines on the road.
Do you think that said that the first 

3185
02:36:47,161 --> 02:36:49,890
sentence being is going to be a nine 
slash 1117?

3186
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:56,280
I hope it's an american car.
I hope it's corvette or maybe perhaps a 

3187
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:58,951
truck.
Maybe an f150 takes out godless 

3188
02:36:58,951 --> 02:36:59,890
heathens.
Just drives around,

3189
02:37:00,110 --> 02:37:01,330
eats assholes.
Um,

3190
02:37:01,410 --> 02:37:02,440
I,
I wonder,

3191
02:37:02,500 --> 02:37:03,010
you know,
I,

3192
02:37:03,011 --> 02:37:08,011
I think for sure if we can live you and 
I'm 47,

3193
02:37:08,140 --> 02:37:09,120
how old are you?
40 seven.

3194
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:12,280
40 seven.
So if we could live another,

3195
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:16,700
if we get really lucky,
we live another 50 years based on modern

3196
02:37:16,760 --> 02:37:19,700
interpretation of science and medicine.
I'm actually 46 by the way,

3197
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:22,920
hopefully 70 march just because now got 
lexus open.

3198
02:37:23,160 --> 02:37:28,160
Get at least you added the right way.
You know if you like.

3199
02:37:28,521 --> 02:37:29,480
I'm 40 ish.

3200
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:31,850
I have a friend who won't tell me his 
age in edwards.

3201
02:37:31,880 --> 02:37:33,770
He won't tell me how old he is.
A motherfucker.

3202
02:37:35,550 --> 02:37:37,760
I think he's my age,
but he won't say it.

3203
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:43,170
I should.
I should've said 47 because then we 

3204
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:43,170
could pay the real change.
Yeah,

3205
02:37:43,170 --> 02:37:46,390
very funny.
Wikipedia wikipedias long wrong about a 

3206
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:46,390
lot of shit.
I just filled it.

3207
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:47,870
Still thinks brian counts my brother.
It's still thinks I'm five feet tall.

3208
02:37:48,620 --> 02:37:49,730
If you.
If,

3209
02:37:49,810 --> 02:37:54,810
if you consider this idea that we.
If we everything goes correct and we 

3210
02:37:55,851 --> 02:37:58,190
live to be 95 years old.
Let's go.

3211
02:37:58,191 --> 02:38:02,180
Let's go there for sure.
there's going to be something.

3212
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:07,420
You know there's gonna be some.
They've already got these little 

3213
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:07,670
japanese talking head ones that look 
erie.

3214
02:38:07,730 --> 02:38:12,170
Very strange sort of artificial faces 
that talk to you.

3215
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:17,320
There's gonna come a point in time as 
the exponential increase in technology,

3216
02:38:17,391 --> 02:38:22,391
whether it's 20,
30 years where they're going to make 

3217
02:38:22,391 --> 02:38:22,391
fake fucking people.
Man,

3218
02:38:22,391 --> 02:38:22,490
let me,
let me,

3219
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:23,050
let me pull it up.

3220
02:38:23,090 --> 02:38:24,340
Something else.
Nothing to do with me.

3221
02:38:24,350 --> 02:38:25,760
This friend of mine,
alex garland,

3222
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:29,720
it just made a film called ex makena and
which is a great science fiction film,

3223
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:34,780
which shouldn't be coming to the states.
It's just been released in the uk x 

3224
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:34,780
magazine.

3225
02:38:34,780 --> 02:38:36,760
Can I get it online somewhere legally?
Not illegally,

3226
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:38,770
I suppose illegally.
Can I get it?

3227
02:38:38,950 --> 02:38:41,530
That's a problem.
You fucker the second legal so I can get

3228
02:38:41,550 --> 02:38:41,630
it.

3229
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:45,710
You'll see the trailer,
you can get the trailer on youtube,

3230
02:38:45,711 --> 02:38:47,230
but it's been released in the states.
Can't remember when,

3231
02:38:47,330 --> 02:38:48,050
but it's,
it's great.

3232
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:49,370
And it's about,
it's about an ai,

3233
02:38:49,550 --> 02:38:53,660
uh,
a female ai and it's uh,

3234
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:57,010
it's about a guy kind of like one of 
these elan musk type guy guys.

3235
02:38:57,020 --> 02:39:02,020
He lives out in the woods and he and 
he's built one of these things and he 

3236
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:03,380
gets one of his employees to come and do
a turing test on it,

3237
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:06,830
which is to see if he thinks that this 
thing has sentience,

3238
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:11,860
this ai.
But she's beautiful and it kind of goes 

3239
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:12,920
off from there.
But alex wrote the beach and he wrote 28

3240
02:39:12,921 --> 02:39:13,520
days later

3241
02:39:14,560 --> 02:39:14,980
say

3242
02:39:15,460 --> 02:39:18,100
really brilliant science fiction film,
but it,

3243
02:39:18,220 --> 02:39:23,220
it is slow.
Some of these issues that we've been 

3244
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:23,220
talking about about what it is to be 
human,

3245
02:39:23,220 --> 02:39:27,061
are the ais bathers,
are they better than it was morally 

3246
02:39:27,061 --> 02:39:27,380
physically strange?
What is it that.

3247
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:30,640
Why is this girl so beautiful white 
wine?

3248
02:39:30,641 --> 02:39:32,950
Did he make this beautiful woman?
It's just,

3249
02:39:32,951 --> 02:39:37,951
it's a great film.
So I recommend that to everyone who's 

3250
02:39:37,951 --> 02:39:37,951
listening.
That sounds amazing.

3251
02:39:37,951 --> 02:39:39,790
when is it going to be released here?
It must be very soon because it's been.

3252
02:39:39,791 --> 02:39:41,290
It's just been out in the uk.
Did very well.

3253
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:47,070
Is it going to be released in theaters 
or is a digital release April 10th in 

3254
02:39:47,070 --> 02:39:47,270
America.
So you'd.

3255
02:39:48,310 --> 02:39:49,180
wow,
that sounds.

3256
02:39:49,181 --> 02:39:50,370
That's a great concept.
I mean,

3257
02:39:50,630 --> 02:39:52,720
I,
I've said for a long time,

3258
02:39:52,721 --> 02:39:55,780
but I believe the first artificial 
intelligence be sex slaves.

3259
02:39:56,110 --> 02:39:57,790
People are going to make artificial 
sucks.

3260
02:39:57,791 --> 02:40:02,791
People.
People that are going to have sex with 

3261
02:40:02,791 --> 02:40:03,730
like is it cheating to use a device?
Is it cheating to masturbate?

3262
02:40:03,731 --> 02:40:06,520
Some people say yes,
I was reading a forum article was people

3263
02:40:06,940 --> 02:40:11,940
arguing as guys arguing with his wife.
She's saying if he doesn't stop 

3264
02:40:11,940 --> 02:40:14,851
masturbating,
she's going to divorce him specifically 

3265
02:40:14,851 --> 02:40:14,851
to,
you know,

3266
02:40:14,851 --> 02:40:17,950
augie with his hand and say he ended the
insightful advice.

3267
02:40:18,110 --> 02:40:20,250
Seven faithfulness just beat his hand 
up.

3268
02:40:20,870 --> 02:40:22,590
But um,
then,

3269
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:27,650
you know,
it goes from masturbation to 

3270
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:30,800
masturbation using technology and the 
internet to watch pornography to 

3271
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:32,420
masturbation using a device.
Like they have these,

3272
02:40:32,421 --> 02:40:32,880
uh,
you know,

3273
02:40:32,881 --> 02:40:34,190
what oculus rift is,
I'm sure.

3274
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,850
Right.
That's good.

3275
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:38,880
I should go with that.
The new version of it.

3276
02:40:39,180 --> 02:40:42,720
My friend duncan called me up.
I was at the improv and when,

3277
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:44,730
you know,
when he called me,

3278
02:40:44,731 --> 02:40:49,731
I was about to go onstage.
It was like five minutes for I go on 

3279
02:40:49,731 --> 02:40:51,931
stage and he had just got back from some
three d virtual reality conference and 

3280
02:40:51,931 --> 02:40:55,320
he's just screaming at my phone.
It's a fucking game changer,

3281
02:40:55,321 --> 02:40:56,610
man.
This is the craziest shit.

3282
02:40:56,611 --> 02:41:00,510
I said that it was the,
the hd quaLity was stunning.

3283
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:04,010
I did 70.
Let me have a look at the one that we,

3284
02:41:04,030 --> 02:41:05,190
there's an oculus and something else.

3285
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:06,900
They use them for the past four,
which is not going.

3286
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:08,460
It's not out yet.
We did it in 12 months.

3287
02:41:08,461 --> 02:41:09,270
I think.
Something like that.

3288
02:41:09,810 --> 02:41:14,400
It's amazing that they showed me this 
demo and it's a real.

3289
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:17,150
It's like it's done.
Very,

3290
02:41:17,151 --> 02:41:22,151
very good.
I think that is going to be a game 

3291
02:41:22,151 --> 02:41:22,151
changer.
Well,

3292
02:41:22,151 --> 02:41:24,511
they decided to do first person 
pornography with these things that 

3293
02:41:24,511 --> 02:41:26,100
supposed to just be like there was a 
real issue that people are going to have

3294
02:41:26,101 --> 02:41:30,390
with being addicted to this stuff 
because I don't believe that our minds.

3295
02:41:30,391 --> 02:41:35,391
I think one of the.
One of the reasons why people have such 

3296
02:41:35,391 --> 02:41:36,150
a deep,
like what we were talking about earlier,

3297
02:41:36,200 --> 02:41:41,200
that people get angry,
a dumb programming and people get angry 

3298
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:41,200
at,
you know,

3299
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:45,620
dumb songs and dump television shows.
One of the reasons I think we have this 

3300
02:41:46,020 --> 02:41:48,330
instinct to get upset at it is we.

3301
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:53,420
I think we inherently understand that 
we're not designed to process the media 

3302
02:41:54,391 --> 02:41:57,540
that we've created.
We're designed to imitate the successful

3303
02:41:57,541 --> 02:42:02,541
behaviors or other tribal members.
We were designed to listen to people 

3304
02:42:02,541 --> 02:42:03,330
like you talk and be inspired,
but you're right here.

3305
02:42:03,331 --> 02:42:04,760
I'm looking right at you.
It evolved,

3306
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:05,570
right?
You're not,

3307
02:42:05,590 --> 02:42:06,400
you're saying,
well,

3308
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:11,480
I don't mean it in that sense.
I mean in a sense of how we function 

3309
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:11,730
evolved.
I'm sorry,

3310
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:14,520
I don't mean design,
but if you,

3311
02:42:14,680 --> 02:42:17,290
if you take that into consideration,
what,

3312
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:17,750
what?
Uh,

3313
02:42:17,780 --> 02:42:22,780
what about a screen that's 60 feet tall 
and brad pitt comes on and his bone 

3314
02:42:23,131 --> 02:42:24,870
structure is fucking perfect and if it's
not,

3315
02:42:24,871 --> 02:42:29,871
they manipulate it and make it perfect 
with three g cgi and every time he talks

3316
02:42:30,270 --> 02:42:33,720
music's playing and every word out of 
his mouth is carefully considered.

3317
02:42:33,721 --> 02:42:35,820
Although It looks spontaneous,
it's not.

3318
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:41,060
They've carefully considered this for 
weeks and weeks for maximum impact on 

3319
02:42:41,060 --> 02:42:44,601
your psyche and your sitting there and 
the music's playing and he kisses 

3320
02:42:44,601 --> 02:42:46,740
angelina jolie and oh,
like we're not designed for that.

3321
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:49,740
So our,
our very exisTence,

3322
02:42:49,741 --> 02:42:54,741
the world that we live in,
our model of it is based like ninetY 

3323
02:42:54,741 --> 02:42:57,570
percent on bullshit.
Ten percent of real life experiences,

3324
02:42:57,720 --> 02:43:02,720
90 percent on movies.
And I have a friend who got in a fight 

3325
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:07,011
with a guy and the guy said to him while
they're about to fight some drunken 

3326
02:43:07,011 --> 02:43:09,150
thing,
prepare to dine in hell tonight.

3327
02:43:09,151 --> 02:43:12,010
We dine in hell.
He yelled out a fucking quote

3328
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,070
from a stupid movie when they were about
to fist fight.

3329
02:43:15,370 --> 02:43:16,530
They were fist fighting,
like,

3330
02:43:16,660 --> 02:43:18,580
which could potentially leave it lead to
death.

3331
02:43:18,581 --> 02:43:23,581
I mean,
when you're involved in like actively 

3332
02:43:23,581 --> 02:43:24,280
trying to hurt another human being,
all fucking bets are out the window.

3333
02:43:24,630 --> 02:43:25,900
This is chaos,
right?

3334
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:28,540
And the guy's yelling at a movie quote 
tonight.

3335
02:43:28,541 --> 02:43:33,370
We dine in the beginning of a beautiful 
friendship.

3336
02:43:33,500 --> 02:43:38,500
We're just randomly sharing quotes back 
from the grid.

3337
02:43:40,400 --> 02:43:44,690
We're off to see the wiz.
That's crazy.

3338
02:43:46,090 --> 02:43:49,750
You are.
My brother were crazy.

3339
02:43:50,050 --> 02:43:53,690
I don't think the,
the inspiration that I get from songs,

3340
02:43:53,691 --> 02:43:56,080
like there's songs that I'll listen to,
you know,

3341
02:43:56,081 --> 02:43:56,830
like,
um,

3342
02:43:57,100 --> 02:43:59,020
there's certain like,
like weightlifting.

3343
02:43:59,021 --> 02:43:59,950
Sorry,
I swear.

3344
02:43:59,951 --> 02:44:01,420
When you live,
listen to those songs,

3345
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:04,210
you can lift more weights.
You can work out harder.

3346
02:44:04,300 --> 02:44:05,710
Like you're tired,
you're on the elliptical.

3347
02:44:05,711 --> 02:44:10,711
Machine.
Queen comes on like dragon attack and 

3348
02:44:10,711 --> 02:44:10,711
you,
your,

3349
02:44:10,711 --> 02:44:11,950
your,
your body reacts to it.

3350
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:16,950
You have a physiological response to 
media is something that's been created 

3351
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:19,090
that doesn't exist in nature with all of
nature's majesty,

3352
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:24,270
with fucking waterfalls and flowers.
It never figured out how to make sound 

3353
02:44:24,270 --> 02:44:26,890
come out of a headset.
That's just incredible.

3354
02:44:26,990 --> 02:44:28,020
It just makes your,
your,

3355
02:44:28,021 --> 02:44:28,480
your,
your,

3356
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:30,430
your fucking goosebumps.
Raise up.

3357
02:44:30,640 --> 02:44:33,850
We've created some weird shit and in 
creating that weird shit,

3358
02:44:33,851 --> 02:44:38,851
we're,
we're altering our very version of the 

3359
02:44:38,851 --> 02:44:40,480
reality that we observe with our,
our real senses,

3360
02:44:40,481 --> 02:44:43,690
our eyes and our ears and our fingers 
and we're changing it.

3361
02:44:43,691 --> 02:44:48,691
And this oculus rift shit,
it's going to take it to a whole new 

3362
02:44:48,691 --> 02:44:48,691
place.
I mean,

3363
02:44:48,691 --> 02:44:50,950
it's gonna.
It's going to be as addictive as reality

3364
02:44:50,951 --> 02:44:52,480
tv is what?
It's stupidity.

3365
02:44:52,690 --> 02:44:55,060
It's going to be way more addictive.
If you could like,

3366
02:44:55,240 --> 02:44:57,370
look at any part of those people while 
they're talking,

3367
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:58,390
you know,
I mean,

3368
02:44:58,391 --> 02:45:01,450
you could do whatever you want.
You can move around in their world while

3369
02:45:01,451 --> 02:45:02,560
they're,
while they're existing.

3370
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,580
You don't have to have a real,
a real

3371
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:04,840
life.
You've seen wally.

3372
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:06,610
I haven't.
Wally.

3373
02:45:07,090 --> 02:45:08,680
Wally was a good.
Yeah,

3374
02:45:08,681 --> 02:45:10,000
it's great.
It's a great film,

3375
02:45:10,090 --> 02:45:15,090
but everyone just ends up every human is
basically a fat useless slub that floats

3376
02:45:18,191 --> 02:45:22,530
around.
Can't even walk just on a big space line

3377
02:45:22,600 --> 02:45:25,420
floating around in space.
I'm useless.

3378
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,540
Just gone watching tv.
What?

3379
02:45:27,541 --> 02:45:30,640
That sort of sped pessimistic version of
reality.

3380
02:45:31,080 --> 02:45:33,250
What do you think?
What's your version of reality?

3381
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:36,340
This is because we're wrapping up.
We're running at three hours in when you

3382
02:45:36,370 --> 02:45:39,130
turn into a pumpkin,
so we're right about there.

3383
02:45:39,400 --> 02:45:40,670
Like what,
what is he,

3384
02:45:40,750 --> 02:45:43,120
what do you think is going to happen 
with us?

3385
02:45:43,900 --> 02:45:46,000
Are you pessimistic?
Are you optimistic?

3386
02:45:46,030 --> 02:45:50,020
Do you enjoy the way the direction we're
moving ultimately?

3387
02:45:51,490 --> 02:45:52,900
Um,
the,

3388
02:45:53,650 --> 02:45:57,080
our scientific and engineering 
achievement.

3389
02:45:57,090 --> 02:46:01,120
So astonishing and going beautifully 
well.

3390
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:04,120
I think it needs,
needs.

3391
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:07,060
I'm,
I'm optimistic I think,

3392
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:10,310
but I think it just needs a little.
I'm slightly

3393
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:14,150
pessimistic at the moment.
I think it just needs this little nudge.

3394
02:46:14,360 --> 02:46:19,360
I think just a.
We've got the weed in countries like 

3395
02:46:19,360 --> 02:46:19,620
ours,
right?

3396
02:46:19,680 --> 02:46:24,680
We've got these,
these education systems and these 

3397
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:24,680
universities that are broadly speaking,
very good.

3398
02:46:24,680 --> 02:46:29,321
They need a bit more money,
but they're pretty good and we've got a 

3399
02:46:29,321 --> 02:46:33,790
culture that allows us to be open minded
and we have democracies and all these 

3400
02:46:33,790 --> 02:46:37,571
things are very difficult to get.
So I think we often miss the great 

3401
02:46:37,571 --> 02:46:39,800
things that we have in place in places 
like the us and europe.

3402
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:42,770
Definitely really very good.
And so,

3403
02:46:42,810 --> 02:46:47,510
so it just takes a recognition of that.
I think that's what we started again,

3404
02:46:47,511 --> 02:46:52,511
isn't it?
How do you just remind people what 

3405
02:46:52,511 --> 02:46:52,850
wonderful opportunities they have and 
what wonderful things there are to do.

3406
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:58,180
And he just turned the reality tv off 
for a bit and go and read a book or 

3407
02:46:58,411 --> 02:47:00,530
something,
a kindle book.

3408
02:47:00,610 --> 02:47:03,920
Everyone doesn't have to be a real book.
Then,

3409
02:47:04,190 --> 02:47:05,990
you know,
what wonderful things could we achieve?

3410
02:47:06,040 --> 02:47:09,440
So I'm kind of optimistic there.
I think you do

3411
02:47:09,770 --> 02:47:10,290
beautiful.
I,

3412
02:47:10,291 --> 02:47:15,291
I think so.
I mean obviously there's some real 

3413
02:47:15,291 --> 02:47:17,111
issues with culture and society,
but I often wonder as we talked about 

3414
02:47:17,111 --> 02:47:21,161
before,
if those issues just inspire us to 

3415
02:47:21,161 --> 02:47:23,831
improve and change.
And if you can't have a gun without a 

3416
02:47:23,831 --> 02:47:27,221
yang,
I mean you have a bunch of shit going 

3417
02:47:27,221 --> 02:47:27,221
on.
That is,

3418
02:47:27,221 --> 02:47:27,950
it's like a constant ebb and flow.
And I always,

3419
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:31,120
I always ponder whether or not that is 
a,

3420
02:47:31,190 --> 02:47:36,190
almost a mechanism for progress or a 
mechanism for advancement and that 

3421
02:47:36,190 --> 02:47:36,920
without it,
you don't get that.

3422
02:47:37,130 --> 02:47:37,730
I don't know.

3423
02:47:38,450 --> 02:47:40,010
It's possible.
It is possible.

3424
02:47:40,160 --> 02:47:41,670
So we can be optimistic at the end of 
the.

3425
02:47:42,040 --> 02:47:44,530
Yes.
I think we wrapped it up nice.

3426
02:47:44,531 --> 02:47:46,720
I think we brought it home in a 
beautiful way.

3427
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:48,400
I can.
I say just because,

3428
02:47:48,401 --> 02:47:51,280
because my promoters sat over there and 
I know he's been sitting there for three

3429
02:47:51,281 --> 02:47:56,281
hours.
He would like me to remind the viewers 

3430
02:47:56,281 --> 02:47:57,910
that the infinite monkey cage tickets 
are available online.

3431
02:47:58,990 --> 02:48:01,460
Monkey cage.com.
So you're on the,

3432
02:48:01,710 --> 02:48:02,470
you're on the,
uh,

3433
02:48:02,471 --> 02:48:03,280
the,
the la one,

3434
02:48:03,281 --> 02:48:06,850
which is the twelfth of the 12th of 
March.

3435
02:48:06,851 --> 02:48:09,010
Yes.
At the ricardo montalban theater.

3436
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:12,490
How ironic that fantasy island,
the guy from fantasy island,

3437
02:48:12,491 --> 02:48:17,491
that's who ricardo multiple was,
that we're going to be at the ricardo 

3438
02:48:17,491 --> 02:48:20,640
montalban theater,
one of the dumbest fucking shows ever 

3439
02:48:20,640 --> 02:48:23,760
fantasy island that had a little midget 
boss deplane and yang thing,

3440
02:48:24,800 --> 02:48:27,580
the theater that the greater.
And then in san francisco,

3441
02:48:27,581 --> 02:48:32,581
the day after New York and chicago,
all the dates are 

3442
02:48:32,581 --> 02:48:34,560

Um,

3443
02:48:34,930 --> 02:48:36,400
thursday,
March 5th,

3444
02:48:36,401 --> 02:48:40,060
or in nyu at the skirball center in New 
York city.

3445
02:48:40,430 --> 02:48:41,940
Doing that one actually.
Yes,

3446
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:45,280
neil degrasse tyson,
astrophysicist john 11.

3447
02:48:45,281 --> 02:48:46,120
Did I say it right,
john?

3448
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:50,510
Janet.
And then March 7th at the end.

3449
02:48:50,520 --> 02:48:52,500
Theni Anthony Anthony,

paleontologist and evolutionary 
biologist jerry coyne.

3453
02:49:00,670 --> 02:49:05,050
And then of course the twelfth with me 
and a blossom.

3454
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:08,190
The girlfriend blossom loss that she's 
on the big bang theory.

3455
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:10,680
Right?
And it's a feature on the.

3456
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:14,850
Is there quick David Cohen,
emmy award winning writer.

3457
02:49:14,910 --> 02:49:16,770
Secret secret as well.
There might be.

3458
02:49:16,890 --> 02:49:21,890
That might be a pipe in the window.
And you got one March 13th about ufos,

3459
02:49:21,901 --> 02:49:24,090
alien probes and other close encounters.
Oh,

3460
02:49:24,110 --> 02:49:28,650
I want to be on that one.
You damn sure can't go to san francisco.

3461
02:49:28,800 --> 02:49:30,330
I'm busy that day.
Listen,

3462
02:49:30,390 --> 02:49:33,110
you're fucking awesome man.
Thank you very much for existing.

3463
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:37,320
Thanks for doing what you do because 
it's so important.

3464
02:49:37,321 --> 02:49:42,321
It's so exciting to me to be able to 
watch your shows and to be able to just 

3465
02:49:42,321 --> 02:49:47,300
sort of sponge that information from you
and thanks for just keep on keeping it 

3466
02:49:47,410 --> 02:49:51,640
in three weeks and so I'll bring the 
human universe stuff you.

3467
02:49:51,670 --> 02:49:56,670
I'll bring.
I'll bring you some crazy that's 

3468
02:49:56,670 --> 02:49:59,670
downloaded on the yes.
Don't want to do whatever you gotta do 

3469
02:49:59,670 --> 02:50:00,270
folks get back?
Alright,

3470
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:01,260
we love you.
Thank you.

3471
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:04,710
See you soon.
Thank you.

3472
02:50:04,730 --> 02:50:05,280
I enjoyed that.
