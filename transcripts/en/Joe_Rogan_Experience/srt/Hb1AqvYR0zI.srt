1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,620
Okay,

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,260
we get a bunch of gigs in my house,
ladies.

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:11,980
Gentlemen.
Legion of skanks.

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,800
Yeah,
very excited.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,290
All you guys together.
This was a good move.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,480
Good idea.
What's all credit to praise?

7
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:21,530
Praise to big J.
fucked it up.

8
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,110
You do.
But I'm,

9
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm glad this is a.
This is fun.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,410
Longtime coming.
Fuck yeah.

11
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:27,670
Thanks for having us.
My pleasure.

12
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,620
My pleasure.
I'm very excited to be here.

13
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:31,570
Mr.
Rogen Legion to Sancton the house.

14
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,180
I'm going to tell you right now what we 
really mean.

15
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:36,400
This,
this has been a very,

16
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:39,160
very long time comment.
All of the fans have been,

17
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:39,994
uh,
have been kind of looking for this 

18
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,100
moment.
So this is a very,

19
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:42,934
very big deal for me personally.
So I want to say thanks for having a 

20
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:47,490
song,
a sentence away from crying.

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,703
We're all so big.
We probably shouldn't be talking in 

22
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:52,530
public.
Cheers.

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,340
Cheers.

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,510
Gentleman.
You wrote that last night.

25
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,130
Little Mr.
Rogen,

26
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,053
how I spent my summer was good and we 
went to the park and we got to ride all 

27
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,020
the rides.
It's true.

28
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,810
What do you want me to say here these 
days?

29
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,430
Yeah.
Pretend that it's not a big deal.

30
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:07,560
It's a huge deal.
Lewis.

31
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:08,463
Rarely impressed.
Very unimpressed guy and he's really 

32
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:11,470
impressed today.
Yeah.

33
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,110
This is a fucking Disneyland for dudes 
that we're in right now.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,833
It we're in an airport hangar and 
there's just bow and arrows and dead 

35
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:24,991
animals and pool tables and a job 
battlebots the.

36
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,630
I feel most men live lives that are 
very,

37
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,520
very suppressed.
Sure.

38
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,354
Most men,
if they were left to their own devices 

39
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,241
and someone said,
yeah,

40
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:35,350
you do whatever you want in the 
building.

41
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,393
Wait a minute.
I can just decide what to put in the 

42
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:38,944
building,
whatever to pull whatever in the 

43
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,560
building.

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,560
You do the exact same shit for archery.
Set up things that I wanted.

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,020
I wanted to make sure there was room for
an indoor range.

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,940
That was when you went into buying a 
place.

47
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,260
Interesting conversation with a real 
estate agent.

48
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,700
What I need at least 40 yards insurance 
for that.

49
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,140
I said,
can I virtual Hunt Dana?

50
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Is it requests that virtual hunt game is
a very popular game,

51
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,170
that techno hunt thing.
That thing is.

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,580
It's so cool.
Addictive.

53
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,863
Addictive though he can give you bad 
habits to get a little punchy with your 

54
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:25,210
trigger.
I do like that they have some of the,

55
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,180
uh,
animations,

56
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,370
not the where the real life things or 
the deer or the elk.

57
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,030
They're looking at you.
They really do give you a sad face.

58
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,680
Now you do it.
Can you do it?

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,353
Yeah,
you can probably get it with other 

60
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:39,870
things too,
right?

61
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,560
Like,
couldn't you get it with superheroes?

62
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,693
Couldn't you get it like you were that 
archer dude from the avengers and 

63
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,980
fucking those monsters are coming after 
your children because I don't want to do

64
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:58,330
it for me.
Can we upload everyone who bullied Lewis

65
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:00,450
in the third grade?
Kids.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,400
That's the,
uh,

67
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,040
that's the same kids.
That's like when they give the uh,

68
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,343
pedophiles like little,
like underage fuck dollars to try to 

69
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,130
keep him from doing it.
For Real.

70
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,020
She murdered kids with a bow and arrow.
She'd never do that.

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,490
Give it to them.
Now they're available in Asia.

72
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,863
Some control box.
I've heard you can match up up robots 

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
and not in this country.
I found out.

74
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
It's a weird moral thing though,
right?

75
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,290
Like would you or would you rather have 
them fuck a little robot in their closet

76
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,690
somewhere because your first instinct is
always like,

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,560
oh,
that's horrible,

78
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,483
but then you're like,
it's Kinda like giving someone with 

79
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,040
anger issues a punching bag.
Maybe.

80
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,310
It's not the worst thing.
It's like they've got that thing,

81
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,144
whatever it is.
Like how do you get it out on that 

82
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,090
little sweet,
sweet,

83
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,190
beautiful punching bags.

84
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,500
So fucked up feature lists.
Robots don't punch back.

85
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,220
Do you want to like meet in the middle 
and you're like,

86
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:54,941
okay,
it's legal,

87
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:58,200
but you can't name it.
Well,

88
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,280
do you think that you could fuck a real 
doll?

89
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,930
I mean you definitely could if you had 
to,

90
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,730
but would that be something you'd be 
interested in?

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,593
I think I couldn't stop laughing at how 
ridiculous this situation rather just 

92
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:10,090
jerk off and think about things.
I fucked a.

93
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,760
We had as a sponsor,
a flush left.

94
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,150
I've had a flashlight forever.
It's very utilitarian.

95
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:16,984
You're not confusing yourself.
Nobody's ever said that word before 

96
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,320
describing she's the girl of my dreams.
I've never even used it.

97
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,960
I've had it forever.
I've never even thought about it.

98
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,720
I couldn't guess why I would want to use
it.

99
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,080
Seems Weird.
It's weird.

100
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,914
It feels good though.
Does it way better than jerking off 

101
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,240
sculpture whole Dick.

102
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,340
Yeah,
and you put it in warm water and you get

103
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:41,341
it like to attempt to a body and your 
life somehow or another.

104
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,493
There's like a portal,
like this tube is a portal to another 

105
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,480
woman or another dementia,
but all you can get at is her vagina.

106
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,093
Just hold it.
That's it.

107
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,933
Feels real.
The name of this dimension is called 

108
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,003
awesome.
Do you jerk off with a fleshlight or do 

109
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,540
you hold it and fuck it now?
He jerked off.

110
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,390
Jerked me off with the flashlight.
Yeah,

111
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,233
but that was for show.
That was on camera behind the curt 

112
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,530
green.
This interview.

113
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,290
We did this on the podcast.
I swear to God.

114
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,940
He jerked me off for the producer now.
I couldn't get hard.

115
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,470
There was a female comic.
Whoa.

116
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,590
What's that about?
Is that a real.

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,870
That's a real real though.
They get pretty good man.

118
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,240
They were red head though.
It was a documentary on Netflix.

119
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,074
About sex robots really have come far 
because there are people who fall in 

120
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:34,750
love with these sex robots and it looks 
like the fucking taxi driver,

121
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,800
Johnny on the spot from total recall.
It's like,

122
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,730
it's crazy like animatronic chucky 
cheese,

123
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,564
bass player was kind of get to a point 
where it can totally mimic you and he's 

124
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,700
going to get to a point where it really 
is like blade runner,

125
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,563
is that what they are now?
That's the one I thought about buying a 

126
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:53,020
dude one to do Jujitsu with.
I was going to order clearly.

127
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,220
No.
Jake and butthole

128
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,030
proportions are perfect because I have a
doll.

129
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,970
It's Bubba dummy the practice 
submissions on,

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,560
but it's super stiff.
It's like this,

131
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,020
but he beat you.
You basically can drill the moves,

132
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,040
but it's not the same as drilling and on
an anatomically correct body.

133
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,910
If you had an AMA anatomically correct 
body to practice Jujitsu on,

134
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,020
you can get some fucking tight moves.
Can't wait,

135
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,480
can't wait til the day.
When you're announcing for robot fights,

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,150
no,
the zero interest.

137
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,310
There's nothing at stake.
If they live or die,

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,233
it doesn't matter.
The whole thing about fighting is that 

139
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,280
there's some horrible,
gigantic thing at stake.

140
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,470
You can fuck one though.
Yeah,

141
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,060
you can fuck with him.
Fight.

142
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,770
Would you watch two robots?
Fuck.

143
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,890
I would.
I would if there was like some sort of a

144
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:43,724
program that they were running,
I'd want to see like what the program 

145
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,590
was,
how they could do it.

146
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,170
Yeah.
It wouldn't be a jack material.

147
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,463
We completely be fascinated.
They would probably talk to each other 

148
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,830
and numbers and they would both be dudes
that would both be.

149
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,660
There was one that they just made a fuck
dollar.

150
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:57,460
Right.
And this,

151
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,570
this just happened that there's videos 
of it.

152
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,750
The robot sort of speaking like a weird 
code to each other.

153
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,090
These were like fucking like straight up
fuck dolls.

154
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,020
Skynet,
dude.

155
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,033
And they would turn them on and then 
they sort of speaking and would seem 

156
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:11,240
like a code and people were like 
freaking out about this.

157
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,680
Oh I know what you're talking about.
Yeah.

158
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,020
They had these computers,
computer.

159
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,183
There were there were linked together 
and they started communicating to each 

160
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:22,070
other in a language that the coders 
didn't understand and they shut it off.

161
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,993
They're like,
what?

162
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Just simply tell them plugged in,
but I heard that my version of it that I

163
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,654
just said might be the most spectacular 
version sounding but might not be 

164
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:36,800
accurate and that what do they might've 
gotten is like they might have got stuck

165
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:39,260
in like a feedback loop and just been 
making jibberish.

166
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,880
Right.
I heard that too.

167
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,163
So I don't know.
No one's confirmed way too fucking 

168
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,050
stupid to know who's right.
Let's just hope it's that second one.

169
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,340
The first one I just want sounds like a 
opening scene in terminator,

170
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,640
but at the same terms as the solution 
being like,

171
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,950
don't plug that in.
And again man,

172
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,263
like what the fuck are we going to do?
Like I had a podcast with Sam Harris 

173
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:10,271
about it and he is terrified of ai and 
he's far smarter than me.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,200
So whenever I talked to him about shit,
I go,

175
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,160
oh,
okay.

176
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,930
And he's terrified.
Terrified.

177
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,764
That's what freaks me out is when people
way smarter than me are terrified about 

178
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:18,681
it.
Like,

179
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:19,514
uh,
what's his name?

180
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,940
Eli muskets.
Terrified Stephen Hawkins,

181
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,390
Stephen.
I'm like,

182
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,661
no,
no,

183
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:23,841
no,
no,

184
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,730
this is going bad.
And then you're like,

185
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,890
Shit.
Sometimes they're too close to it,

186
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,773
you know?
I feel like some people also get too 

187
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,990
bogged down to the details when you live
your life very ignorantly,

188
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:36,230
like I do,
I have no fear of AI technology guy.

189
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,064
So I'll be honest with you.
Just self driving tesla already kill 

190
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,860
somebody or just self driving.
Taxi rower.

191
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,753
She did something very reckless.
She walked right into traffic and she 

192
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,970
might've been homeless lady.
She might've been on drugs.

193
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,050
They're not,
they're not exactly sure.

194
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,910
I don't think the results of the autopsy
route yet.

195
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,680
But uh,
you watched the video,

196
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,980
she basically just walks right in

197
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,350
front of the car.
The car is going down the road.

198
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:01,620
So a person driving wouldn't have made 
much difference maybe.

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know,
man.

200
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,000
It was hard to tell whether or not you'd
be able to react.

201
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,840
But I guess the technology is,
does it have,

202
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,763
you know,
the technology of stopping quick enough 

203
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,930
to not hit somebody.
They want to make it safer?

204
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:13,764
Right.
That's the idea.

205
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,143
But I think it is right.
I think there's more human error when 

206
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,770
you're dealing with people drinking,
smoking weed,

207
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,340
paying attention to their cell phones.
I almost would rather just trust,

208
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,170
you know,
even if there's a few deaths per year,

209
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:26,004
there's way more deaths per year with 
just laid out the logic for why the 

210
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,500
robots are going to the lady in black.
I trust them.

211
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,660
I trust them.
Was a black lady.

212
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,520
I don't know.
It will be fine.

213
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,354
There's another video,
but just stopping perfectly for a white 

214
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:42,561
woman who ran the test needs to reflect 
on anything dark in the Mediterranean.

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,433
It just fucking run.
The Tesla stops it all of stops it 

216
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:56,460
Persian.
It turns out just through science it has

217
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:59,220
like the same racism of like the 18 
nineties where they're like,

218
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,950
we'll give the Italians have passed the 
rest of you guys.

219
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,784
There's two different types of Mexicans 
is those Oscar de la Hoya Mascot 

220
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,383
Mexicans.
And then there's other Mexicans that 

221
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:11,310
look like Indian or the mustache starts 
on the edge of the lip.

222
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,170
Where would it,
where would it go with them?

223
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,490
You know?
You know,

224
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,280
that's what the comment.
That's what Mexico is essentially,

225
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:18,114
right?
It was a combination of the native 

226
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,550
Americans and Spanish.
Yeah.

227
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,840
And I think.
And then the Spanish ones are like,

228
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:24,880
uh,
you know,

229
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,400
they're the ones who are like,
look down at the locals,

230
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,180
but at this point they're all kind of 
mixed I think.

231
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:30,790
But there's still just a different 
shape.

232
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,820
That's a real Canelo Alvarez.

233
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,383
Yeah.
Right.

234
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,620
Fucking red headed.
Very bizarre.

235
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:40,050
Looking at ck is another one.
He's already had a Mexican dude.

236
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:40,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

237
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,900
Crazy.
I never even think about that.

238
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:46,320
Louise should have started playing that 
card a lot harder after the New York.

239
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,923
His first,
his apology letter should have been 

240
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:49,891
like,
well,

241
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:54,891
as a Mexican girl Jag,
I believe he was born in Mexico.

242
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
I'm not sure about that though.
He was either born in Mexico.

243
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,950
He definitely lived in Mexico.
Really?

244
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,280
I would never have guessed that.
Yeah.

245
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,980
My family lives in Mexico.
They retired to Mexico.

246
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,430
My parents did really want to fucking 
chill out.

247
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,800
Jesse the body Ventura talks about 
Mexico.

248
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,180
It's a lot of reverence.
Lived there.

249
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:18,660
I've got a buddy of mine who's got a 
place in Cabo and he loves it.

250
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,210
He loves it.
It's okay.

251
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:22,070
Cop was a particularly do.
She said he,

252
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:22,904
like,
I went there to do comedy festival and 

253
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:28,500
it's like straight up the worst people 
from like thinking about the worst,

254
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,740
like 40 year old couple from like your 
hometown,

255
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,420
just like fake Tan assholes.
Florida city,

256
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,503
Florida.
But then they all go and meet up in one 

257
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,144
town.
So it's just like thousands of fucking 

258
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,480
awful people in hot ass.
Mexico.

259
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,070
Um,
I don't get it.

260
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,330
I don't get any.
I don't understand.

261
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,164
If you smoke weed,
why you would go to the Caribbean and 

262
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:49,350
not just go to Jamaica every single 
time.

263
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,040
Is Jamaica the spot dog dog.
He loves it.

264
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,230
I love it.
Cool.

265
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,950
He's pushing it hard on us.
Preface with dog.

266
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,690
He's being serious.
I've never been.

267
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,553
Well actually I was,
but it was just like a stop on a cruise 

268
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,630
and I didn't really thought about doing 
a skanks cruise.

269
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,560
Yeah,
yeah,

270
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,780
yeah.
We have to actually do that.

271
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,010
We do our comedy festival every summer 
and we thought about doing your weight.

272
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,083
It's funny,
the festival was influenced by the 

273
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,760
cruise because we did these cruises and 
the idea is you can't escape the,

274
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,710
you know,
the bands can't escape the cruise ship.

275
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:22,150
You're hanging out the whole fucking 
time.

276
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,283
So it's not like you're going to a 
comedy festivals in 10 different 

277
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,200
locations.
It's,

278
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,300
you're going to see a shell.
Right.

279
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,430
Skank fest is all one location.
It's a party,

280
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,930
you know,
two and a half days nonstop.

281
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,720
You're in one location.
So everybody's hanging out and drinking.

282
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,860
We're doing it this year at a place 
called Brooklyn bazaar in greenpoint.

283
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,210
Brooklyn.
It's like a huge.

284
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:43,780
It's an old Polish catering hall.
It has like four different rooms.

285
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:45,940
We're gonna have three different stages 
going on simultaneously.

286
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:46,774
It's really good.
And how did red should fear get the 

287
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,214
publicity scoop?
I believe he organized the festival 

288
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,930
rightly.
He's a piece of shit.

289
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,760
He got the scoop on.
You did that motherfucker now already.

290
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,750
I fucking love already to death,
but he.

291
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,970
How many pills I love already.
Death,

292
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:14,580
but however he's a motherfucker crushers
podcast,

293
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:15,414
burt's wife hated red May.
Still we were talking about before the 

294
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:22,360
podcast that all of our friends that got
fuck you money already said fuck you.

295
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:25,840
The hardest.
Like he does what he wants to do.

296
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,710
It's amazing.
No,

297
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,290
it's fucking beautiful man.
Everyday that I'm running around,

298
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,124
he's like Asian food at a place 
somewhere to an escape room in the 

299
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:35,914
middle of the day.

300
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,280
He's like playful.
I think as kids we're all trying to grow

301
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,260
up and uh,
you know,

302
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,094
make money and do what we do.
But I think the idea is we're all 

303
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:45,130
supposed to be playing this.
Why I,

304
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,230
you know,
I'm joking when I say this,

305
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,073
like a do Disneyland,
but you come in here and you created an 

306
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,400
environment to play every day and 
that's,

307
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,080
that's success today,
right?

308
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,980
Like it to do what you want to do every 
single day.

309
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,660
Play with the toys you want to play 
with.

310
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:56,890
Hanging out the people you want to play 
with.

311
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,520
And I think everyone thinks like when 
you don't have money,

312
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,870
you think when you get money.
Yeah,

313
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:04,210
that's what I'll be like.
But then I've watched so many people who

314
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,740
do get money and then they're like,
yeah,

315
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:08,350
but gotta have retirement money.
Got To make sure I have this,

316
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:09,340
got to make sure I do that.

317
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,173
You know what I mean?
And like artist lives the way you 

318
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,000
thought you would have before you had 
it?

319
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah.
He's not,

320
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,123
he's not like flashy either.
Like he won't even buy a new car that 

321
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:22,540
fuck,
he's got a flip phone and he's got like,

322
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,300
he's like a minimalist addiction.
He's,

323
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,603
he's definitely a minimalist for sure.
But the flip phones a decision because 

324
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:33,790
it was like the fucking he sees he's,
he's a very smart guy.

325
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,100
He's looking around and all these other 
people with their cell phones looking at

326
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:37,240
himself and he's like,
oh,

327
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,390
that thing's just stealing your time and
you're addicted to it.

328
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,760
You know?
Everyone's definitely.

329
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,823
I'm definitely addicted to my phone.
But the bad thing is that reo just 

330
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,650
texted me a googleable question.

331
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,200
What's the weather in Philly or 
something?

332
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:51,830
And you're like,
alright,

333
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,663
this is.
He said he mixes it up between his 

334
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,050
friends.
So it doesn't get too annoying to anyone

335
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,390
person.
Smart.

336
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,590
But it was funny as if he has to listen 
to music,

337
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:04,550
he has to carry around like an extra 
large ipad to hold his headphones.

338
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,080
So that's hilarious.
Oh yeah,

339
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,060
that's hilarious.
Yeah.

340
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,710
The ipad in the back of his,
in the back of his pants,

341
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,300
like a fucking,
like a gun.

342
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,680
He like inspiring.
He's,

343
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,113
I would have myself a like at a comedy 
club of looking at it and are able to 

344
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:18,950
literally come and take his hand and put
it over the phone and be like,

345
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:19,611
dude,
what are you doing?

346
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:20,860
Stop.
We hang out,

347
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,940
talk to us.
And it kind of inspired,

348
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,700
made me self conscious around other 
people doing it.

349
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,410
And now every time I see people doing 
it,

350
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,760
I sort of judged them now.

351
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,130
And it,
it really is true.

352
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:31,964
I mean people live in their cell phone 
every single day and you lose the 

353
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:34,820
connection.
People are,

354
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,530
it sends a message like,
fuck you dude,

355
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:37,364
this person over here is more important 
than the person that's sitting right in 

356
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:40,100
front of me.
Well,

357
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:41,600
it's just the phone.
This,

358
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,240
that light is addictive.
It's addictive.

359
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,770
Looking at the images,
it's like,

360
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,840
you know what happens when a little kid 
sees a TV.

361
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:48,674
You ever see that little kid walks in a 
room with a TV and commercials going on 

362
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:53,810
in the kids like this,
just staring at it because it fucks with

363
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,380
the way you take in like visual 
information.

364
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,423
There's nothing like that in the wild.
There's something like a big screen tv 

365
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:01,810
in the wild,
right?

366
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:05,090
Like that image of Super Bowl on a big 
screen,

367
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,970
TV and hd and you're like,
Holy Shit.

368
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,910
You're looking all the green light.

369
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,100
All the guys running around smashing 
into each other.

370
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:10,934
It's intense.
You don't get that in a real life thing 

371
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:15,120
unless you're about to get eaten.
Yeah.

372
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,963
We'd like to take that serious,
but we've evolved to like see that and 

373
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:23,420
treat it like a big cat running at you 
or something.

374
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,010
Right?
That's what it is,

375
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,220
but it's on your phone and you're 
watching youtube videos like,

376
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,260
look at all that shit.
Moving around on my phone.

377
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,443
I also like to kill time of a.
to where my trick pointed out the other 

378
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,240
day,
if we.

379
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,440
If we ever sit down at a restaurant,
like don't take food to go and sit down,

380
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,753
how quickly I pull out,
like we're playing family feud so it's 

381
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,540
not even just like a pulling back into 
my phone,

382
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,550
but there's still a part of like the 
let's do something right.

383
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,010
Does anybody have a topic?

384
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,630
No.
Alright,

385
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,380
let's talk about.
Let's just play family feud.

386
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,010
If you give yourself a day in a weird 
way,

387
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,730
you ended up,
you make it even worse.

388
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,573
And I live in New York,
said we all do and like they sort of 

389
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,900
doing like little signs in the subway 
that lets you know how long it is before

390
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,220
the subway is going to come.
And that's pretty.

391
00:17:07,221 --> 00:17:08,350
No.
Um,

392
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,570
when I first moved there in 2001,
you would just go.

393
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:10,941
I'm like,
dude,

394
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:13,280
I might be here for 30 minutes.
I might be here for two minutes.

395
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,930
Who knows when the next subway is going 
to come.

396
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,130
But now for subway sign is broken.
I can't wait on that platform.

397
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,220
I have to got to get up and leave and 
get a taxi or whatever because I'll lose

398
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,054
my mind.
Just wondering when that calf is going 

399
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,944
to come,
whereas before you would just chill out 

400
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:28,040
and wait because you had to,
you didn't have the option to.

401
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,590
So now I feel like you have that option 
to be on your phone at all times,

402
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,424
distract yourself,
used to take a shit and you know the 

403
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,240
bathroom reader,
it was my favorite thing in the world.

404
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,074
It was a little facts like thousands of 
them in this fat book that you just was 

405
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,990
covered in.
Shit stands ever fucking fuck you out of

406
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:42,824
the bathroom.
And it was called uncle John's bathroom 

407
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,134
reader and it was just basically snapple
facts about everything in the world and 

408
00:17:48,431 --> 00:17:51,450
handling 20th and it was the coolest 
thing in the world.

409
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,040
But now you have your cell phone so you 
know,

410
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,923
I mean it

411
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,573
right?
But how do you.

412
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,493
There's just certain shit.
You want to know what's going on in the 

413
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,650
world.
So how do you check in on that?

414
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,350
Jesus do it from a computer or like when
you want to read the news,

415
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,170
like I don't know.
How do you get your news?

416
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:06,820
Oh,
I,

417
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm on the laptop on the phone all the 
time and yeah,

418
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,050
and then I just tell these guys what 
they need to know.

419
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,510
Just go get it straight from the trump 
ban.

420
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,800
Yeah.
But I'm on the Paul Band.

421
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,280
Really come down to taxes.
Are you guys,

422
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,220
do you know that?
Very few legit

423
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,093
comics who are as knowledgeable.
I mean you guys have Dave's a very 

424
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,204
valuable resource.

425
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,280
Very much so.
Really standing.

426
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,470
He's brilliant Dave.
He's like literally the only person that

427
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,304
I know that actually reads the books 
puts in the time in and it's kind of 

428
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,281
funny.
We say where,

429
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,860
where people get their news,
they don't really get their news.

430
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,530
They read the headline and then they act
like they're getting their fucking news.

431
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:47,364
They're not putting in the time that 
aren't reading the books and actually 

432
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,150
going and reading a real newspaper 
reading you,

433
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,960
you know,
that gentleman pisses what pisses me off

434
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:55,794
about politics.
I feel like it's the only thing where 

435
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:58,980
like if you don't like.
So if you don't,

436
00:18:58,981 --> 00:18:59,814
uh,
if,

437
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,610
if Lewis doesn't watch 
basketball@allandj.watches

438
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,473
every single sixers game,
but then there's like a thing coming up 

439
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,380
where like something about a basketball 
game,

440
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,480
Louis won't just start arguing with you 
like,

441
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:09,870
Nah,
Nah,

442
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,703
they need to play this defense.
They need to go into a zone because 

443
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:12,631
you're like,
yeah,

444
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,100
I just,
I don't really know about that.

445
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,970
But for some reason with politics,
yeah.

446
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,030
No matter how much anybody's not read 
anything,

447
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,010
they don't know anything.
They have no problem.

448
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:23,170
Just having a hard core strong opinion 
like,

449
00:19:23,171 --> 00:19:23,580
oh,
use.

450
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,300
Because I'll see you

451
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,000
know about it.
Right?

452
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,730
So when someone's like super 
argumentative about it,

453
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:29,061
like,
oh,

454
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:29,894
you're not even well informed,
which is most of the case with people 

455
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:34,790
that are really super aggressive about 
it.

456
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,000
It seems like.
I mean,

457
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:40,080
do they have this thing where they were 
interviewing people at the fucking march

458
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:40,914
for life?
I think they called it the gun control 

459
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
march.
How feel just now?

460
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,840
Well,
no,

461
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,880
they were like all owners in a bunch of 
different cities that we saw it,

462
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,350
but it happened at a bunch of different 
cities.

463
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:52,830
I think the big ones were in DC and I 
think there was one out here like that.

464
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,813
There was this guy just interviewing 
people and he'd go around and ask them 

465
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,300
if they,
uh,

466
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,940
if they are for an assault weapons ban 
and they'd be like,

467
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:00,751
yes,
and then he'd go,

468
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:01,584
what's an assault weapon?
And it's amazing how many people just 

469
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,310
didn't know.
Now I'm not even.

470
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,290
Whatever your take on an assault weapon 
ban is,

471
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,483
it's like,
how could you be for banning something 

472
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,950
that you can't even define as?
Just hold on a second.

473
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,140
Yeah,
exactly.

474
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,750
You're like,
they know that this is what it does.

475
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,693
They,
you know,

476
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,300
a rifle that shoots people.
It's like a semiautomatic.

477
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,350
It's on a hunting gun.
So rifle is designed to shoot people,

478
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,100
like in a military situation,
that's what it looks like.

479
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,203
So they're raw,
they don't know what an ar 15 versus an 

480
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,520
or whatever versus like what's legal,
what's semiautomatic,

481
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:36,780
what's.
They'll know all the details,

482
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:39,960
but they do know that these are guns 
that kill people with.

483
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,923
Okay,
sure.

484
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,853
Fair enough.
But I feel like there's like a thing 

485
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:45,160
where there'll be like one for a ban on 
semiautomatic weapons,

486
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,780
so you want to ban handguns soon.
They're like,

487
00:20:46,781 --> 00:20:47,960
no,
we want a bad hand guns,

488
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,990
but guns are semiautomatic weapons.
It's just like if you're gonna protest,

489
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,470
read a book on it.
It's not just having a passive opinion.

490
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:58,670
You're like out marching to.
You know,

491
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,460
they want to move the ball down the 
field though,

492
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:01,930
and the more people that come here,
they have kids,

493
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:04,690
literally kids that are in the fifth 
grade walking out of their classrooms.

494
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:07,270
They don't fucking know what they're 
talking about or what they're doing.

495
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:09,730
Their task sometimes.
There was a girl with armpit hair,

496
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:13,380
you want to fuck me?

497
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,440
That's true or dirty Harry.
Harry.

498
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,790
Every tone mean.
But how many of these kids,

499
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,683
this is a big one.
How many kids are against putting kids 

500
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,043
on psychotropic drugs,
putting kids on unnecessary psychiatric 

501
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:30,964
medications.
Parents dope their kids up all the time 

502
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,930
because they don't want to deal with 
some hyperactive kid.

503
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,380
Some kid has got some fucking power,
some energy.

504
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,260
He said I saw the walls on.
I was in.

505
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:43,660
We were embracing the other day right 
before the show we did.

506
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,093
And there was a kid,
I mean he must've had autism or or 

507
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,970
something or some extreme case of it.
Uh,

508
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,180
but he was like,
you know,

509
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,210
he was having some sort of violent 
episode,

510
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:54,370
I'm assuming,
but it was just a dad,

511
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,863
like calm as day just sitting on a 
corner with this kid with the kid face 

512
00:21:57,981 --> 00:21:58,814
down as a kids,
like screaming and shaking and kicking 

513
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:00,760
his arms and legs.

514
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,390
And then I was just holding the kid down
and it was so hard to like,

515
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,220
I almost wanted to say something like,
I didn't know.

516
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,090
I know they don't ever really tell you 
what to do,

517
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,530
like,
what's going on in that situation.

518
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,364
And I kind of watched it for a minute 
because it looked like he was abusing 

519
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,980
the kid for a second,
but then you kind of realize that like,

520
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,823
oh,
this kid was gonna like hurt himself or 

521
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,650
whatever it was.
But that's like a,

522
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,030
that's like a really,
really hard thing.

523
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,810
Yeah,
I can,

524
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:26,860
I can accept more in the real extreme 
cases where kids have like severe,

525
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,480
severe,
severe problems,

526
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,620
but it seems like they're just happy to 
like anyone's like,

527
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,770
hyperactive,
just this kind of loose thing.

528
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,780
So no matter all,
it's not a one or a zero.

529
00:22:34,781 --> 00:22:35,800
Right.
It's like there's,

530
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,040
there's varying stages of issues that 
kids are going to have and some kids are

531
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,390
going to need some kind of medication,
but they're definitely over prescribing.

532
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,670
Definitely.
I knew my neighbor had a kid.

533
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,670
There was nothing wrong with them.
It's just a fucking kid.

534
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And they put him on Ritalin or adderall 
is a drug man.

535
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,111
Absolutely.
Yeah.

536
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:56,570
Yeah.
That's,

537
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,390
it's not.
I give it to my five year old.

538
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,253
We snorted together.
If people don't get enough attention or 

539
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,820
they don't have an outlet and they don't
know what to do with themselves,

540
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,683
they get wacky.
It doesn't mean you need to give them 

541
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:10,234
drugs.
Some of these people have legitimate 

542
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:15,700
issues and they probably do need 
medication and some of these people just

543
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,800
need to find something that's 
interesting in life.

544
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,290
Yeah.
Well I think what you were saying before

545
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,124
about like,
why don't these kids look into that 

546
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:22,624
stuff?
I think a lot of times it's just like 

547
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,920
people want the simple thing and got to 
actually.

548
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,390
This is a really difficult question to 
get into this stuff.

549
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,500
Whereas if you're just like,
oh,

550
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm against guns,
that's easy.

551
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,270
I think it's the same thing as when 
people are just offended it.

552
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,260
It's like you don't really have to like 
read a lot.

553
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:38,260
You don't have to know a lot.
You just easy to be right and you've got

554
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:39,820
the answer.
It's laziness.

555
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,920
People can just pick a side very easily 
and go,

556
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:42,754
cool.
Everyone's already defined was on that 

557
00:23:43,601 --> 00:23:44,351
side,
so yeah,

558
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm on that side.
I did my work right,

559
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,303
and it's the same being a parent parent.
A lot of parents are really lazy and 

560
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,720
you,
you watch it happen when they give their

561
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,640
kid an ipad or I,
you know,

562
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,590
or you know,
put them in front of the computer.

563
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,090
That whole thing just happened with Elsa
Gate,

564
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:56,990
which was,
you know,

565
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,170
borderline hilarious that parents were 
getting trolled into their kids watching

566
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,400
really fucked up like cartoon.

567
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,210
I forgot the name of it.
That's the name of it.

568
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,140
Yeah.
That was crazy.

569
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:10,560
We've talked about that a bunch of times
about the babies with the broken bottles

570
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:14,520
over their head up,
having the same scene play out.

571
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,830
Kids would get drunk whether they were a
kid,

572
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,950
mice or kill ducks or they would get 
drunk.

573
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,933
A bottle would go flying through the air
and hit the baby in the head and blood 

574
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,800
would be everywhere.
It was like a baby's nightmare to.

575
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:29,490
Those videos were so crazy.
David Lynch,

576
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,020
it was a punishment for shitty parents 
who weren't watching their kids and what

577
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:36,854
they're putting on their tv because if 
you were just paying attention for a 

578
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,733
minute you.
I'm saying right it you have to stop 

579
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:43,010
paying attention for a couple of hours 
for a kid to get there,

580
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,190
so it was only really shitty parents 
that we're dealing with that.

581
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,990
Is that really true?
It's dude.

582
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:48,824
Yeah.
There was no way to like land on that 

583
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,520
just by googling spiderman.
That wasn't the first one was coming up.

584
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,830
It was.
They would.

585
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,870
I think there were like paying to get in
like a loop of certain videos.

586
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:57,704
Like it was really.
I was obsessed with it for like a week 

587
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,453
and I just couldn't stop going on under 
that subreddit page and it was freaky 

588
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:04,470
dude.

589
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,470
They weren't really porn spiderman ones 
and all these.

590
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:14,830
I think they took some of them down but 
it's.

591
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,140
But then it gets to this place where 
you're like,

592
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:17,974
okay,
are you taking it down because it's 

593
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:22,000
targeting children.
Are you taking it down because you can't

594
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:25,990
show cartoon babies getting hit in the 
head with bottles because if that's what

595
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,550
you're saying,
boy,

596
00:25:27,551 --> 00:25:30,820
there's a lot of fucking south parks 
that you're not gonna be able to show.

597
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,780
There's a lot,
a lot,

598
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:32,970
a lot of different things.
You know,

599
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,030
little show.
So yeah.

600
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:34,864
Where's the line?
Because you think this is creepy and is 

601
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:41,410
luring kids in versus the just the act 
of it was a funny,

602
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,570
you know Tim and Eric Sketch.
Sure.

603
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:45,880
And a cartoon baby got hit in the head 
with a bottle.

604
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,050
You'd be like,
what the fuck?

605
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,640
These guys are nuts.
That's what you'd say.

606
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,990
But you wouldn't be like saying this has
got to be removed off of Youtube.

607
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,063
Yeah.
It's hard to see the intention because 

608
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,730
you could easily say like,
oh well South Park is a cartoon,

609
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,990
right?
So is that appealing to kids?

610
00:25:58,991 --> 00:25:59,824
But I think to Lewis his point that the 
solution isn't that this shit needs to 

611
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:02,884
be banned.
The solution is just like let parents 

612
00:26:04,181 --> 00:26:09,181
know always the solution.
Every single time we talk about Louis.

613
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,713
What was the other one we watched?
Oh father your father with two kids and 

614
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:17,320
it's really just creepy issue happen.
All right,

615
00:26:17,321 --> 00:26:18,970
so this is another one of those like 
that.

616
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:21,640
The kids are watching that.
If you watch it for a second,

617
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:22,474
you're like,
this is.

618
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,990
I pulled it off.
It was a dad and his channel,

619
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:25,470
um,
um,

620
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,670
I'm sorry,
I forget the name of the channel,

621
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:27,504
but he had his two little girls who were
probably seven and nine years old and 

622
00:26:30,031 --> 00:26:32,060
they were doing like,
just kind of weird shit dude.

623
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:32,894
They're like eating chocolate bars and 
it'd be chocolate all over their face 

624
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,643
and you know,
they'd make weird sounds and they'd 

625
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,510
climb up stairs and they'd show it from 
like,

626
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:43,560
behind there.
But it was very fucking pedophilia cut.

627
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:44,394
Don't even know

628
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,413
it was fucked up dude.
And this guy is channel got taken down 

629
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,420
and the guy's like doing interviews,
like,

630
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:48,811
Nah,
dude,

631
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:49,644
whatever.
We also millions of subscribers to the 

632
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,810
channel making tons of money paying for 
his house with this channel.

633
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,010
Whoa.
And they shut the whole channel now.

634
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,380
And what did he say when you interviewed
them?

635
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
I don't know,
I read some thing when it was just kinda

636
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,541
like,
yeah,

637
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,070
we're trying to get our channel back and
you know,

638
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:05,610
he was just like very innocent.
There was another thing the same again.

639
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,410
So fuck,
I'm on my own time.

640
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,540
I got to go to Vimeo.
Um,

641
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,380
but the same when we were talking about 
this stuff that was mom's,

642
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,090
they were regular like mom bloggers.
Right?

643
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,700
And they bring like their daughter to 
Kmart.

644
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:21,720
Right?
This is the channel,

645
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:22,554
by the way.
I'm youtube terminates toy freaks 

646
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:27,810
channel amid broader crackdown on 
disturbing kids content.

647
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,210
Okay.
It is very,

648
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,760
like what Jay said,
it's a very David Lynch type vibe.

649
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,594
Like you feel like you're in some 
nightmare world where everyone's just 

650
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:40,350
acting not the right human way.
That eight point $5 million subscribers,

651
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,443
gold plaques that you have amongst her 
top most 100 most viewed channels on 

652
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,010
youtube.
That's incredible.

653
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,050
Either pacifiers in their mouth.
It.

654
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,120
Dude,
it's fucking bizarre.

655
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:56,820
You gotta somehow somehow got to that 
level before.

656
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,910
Can we watch some of this and I can't 
show it.

657
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,950
You can't show it on TV.
Can we watch it?

658
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,180
Is there a way we can not see it?
We're about to get rated.

659
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,640
You get what you figured out?
Okay.

660
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,410
Yeah.
Don't know what the problem is.

661
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,410
Whenever we put something on youtube 
that shouldn't be on youtube,

662
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,693
we get flagged this.
It was like mommy bloggers and they 

663
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:19,464
would like have a video of them and 
their daughter going to the supermarket 

664
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,820
and it'd be like 500 views.
Yeah,

665
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,670
don't do it.
Jamie.

666
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,653
If I was thinking of Youtube flags it so
no one else could see it on another 

667
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:30,270
website.
Okay.

668
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,103
Okay.
Okay.

669
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,693
I'm sorry.
Louis what?

670
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,320
Okay.
I see.

671
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,153
So then they do another,
the same mommy blogger would do one 

672
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:36,804
called bath time and she's like bathing 
her five year old and it's not anything 

673
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,150
more than her like sitting in the 
bathtub.

674
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,253
But those videos were getting millions 
of views and then the mom would disable 

675
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:49,260
the comments and turn off the thumbs up 
and the thumbs downs.

676
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,363
So they were just monetizing pedophiles 
jerking off to their daughters in a 

677
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,690
bathtub and it was just like a whole 
subculture that was happening on youtube

678
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,823
that was sort of just.
Nobody was really talking about it and 

679
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:02,250
they kind of made it go away.
It wasn't even a big deal.

680
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,790
So this,
I'm watching this.

681
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,860
It's not disturbing it all.
It's just dumb.

682
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,293
They just eating weird food and then and
getting like whip cream and ice cream 

683
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:17,970
and cake and nachos altogether.
Well here's what happens.

684
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:19,920
Babies.
This is really targeted towards babies.

685
00:29:19,921 --> 00:29:22,470
They liked the colors.
So what happened?

686
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,080
Like they see these flashing crazy 
colors.

687
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:25,914
Then I'm packaging candy and cake and 
eating cake and two year olds love this 

688
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:30,210
shit.
They keep on clicking on it,

689
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,770
but pedophiles are also jerking off to 
these girls putting chocolate bananas in

690
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:36,120
there.
So that was sort of the issue.

691
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,900
So they got the parents will subscribe 
to whatever because the kids,

692
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,240
they want to put their kid in front of 
the TV and have the TV babysit them,

693
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,080
but it was also another big part of the 
people who are watching this.

694
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,710
You see the comments and sometimes the 
comments were like encrypted and like in

695
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,600
different languages and they were using 
code words.

696
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,780
Are they using that pizza gate yet?
It's all connected.

697
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,570
It's fucking crazy.
If you make a big complaint though about

698
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,000
something you have to draw a conclusion 
to,

699
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,180
it really makes it seem like you're the 
person thinking that you're like,

700
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:05,770
come on.
You don't think that's hot.

701
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,710
Yeah,
exactly.

702
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,800
You wouldn't want to jerk off to this.
C'Mon.

703
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:11,300
We're all jerking off to this day.
Who didn't jerk off to that little early

704
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,590
Mitchell that a cheetah with sour cream 
on it.

705
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,730
I'll just go up to anybody and you're 
just in it for the food.

706
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,280
Get these kids out of here family.
I didn't notice.

707
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:27,281
You say what can and can't be on TV 
though or on video or on,

708
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,623
you know?
When do you say they're going to want 

709
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,870
this,
but I know.

710
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,800
Right,
but whose day?

711
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,150
Right?
Because we've all.

712
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,013
We've all got this weird thing about 
free speech because if it wasn't for 

713
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,400
free speech,
we wouldn't be able to do anything,

714
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,070
wouldn't be able to do podcasts,
wouldn't be able to do comedy,

715
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,293
get in trouble for everything.
It's very important to be able to 

716
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,710
express your ideas,
but what if those ideas are,

717
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,230
you're a.
you're a pedophile.

718
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,670
Like what if?
What about that?

719
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:54,660
Are you allowed to do pedophile anime?
Like how it would.

720
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,250
Where's the,
where's the line and why?

721
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,290
Why are we able to draw that line?
You know,

722
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,310
I draw a Dick Right now when I will 
drive deck.

723
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,303
Here's a deck.
Now if I say this is a four year old 

724
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,340
Dick.
Okay,

725
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:07,840
there you go.
Well,

726
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:10,180
I'll just say that four year olds got a 
big Dick.

727
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,043
Just got a giant happy man.
He put a four year old posts around it 

728
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:21,300
too soon.
But you read,

729
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,660
you raised a really good question.
It's like,

730
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:23,494
I think the way it's working now is it's
kind of whatever youtube decides or 

731
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:27,820
facebook decides because truly we 
decide,

732
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,663
right?
Yep.

733
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,140
Like they'll have these kind of like 
vague policy guidelines,

734
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,870
but then you'll see some people violate 
it and it's not a problem,

735
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,460
but if it's a message that they don't 
like,

736
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,650
then that seems to be the one that gets 
taken off.

737
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,390
I just,
I don't know,

738
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:40,980
man.
It's hard.

739
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,040
I,
I honestly,

740
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,993
I'm,
I would defend free speech toward 

741
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,610
anything.
Like,

742
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:48,250
I don't care what you're saying,
unless you're inciting violence,

743
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,173
just legally speaking,
a defendant like you got to be allowed 

744
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,520
to say anything.

745
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,353
Even if it's like I wanna fuck kids or 
something that's really disgusting like 

746
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:55,384
that.
As long as you're not actually fucking 

747
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,130
kids,
you're not doing anything.

748
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,900
When I,
you gotTa have fuel,

749
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,793
do you think you should always employee 
you're free ability for free speech 

750
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,940
though?
Like sometimes just don't know.

751
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:06,760
Of course there's lots of things you 
shouldn't say that place is different.

752
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,930
That's not like a park.
You see?

753
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,180
Here's the thing.
I think in our lifetime there's going to

754
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:11,014
be words that are bad that you're not 
gonna be able to say in public spaces 

755
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:15,610
like parks and shit like that.
I can say parks.

756
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,130
Rosa parks.
Yes.

757
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:17,964
It could be.
That's one of the ones that ask Jamie 

758
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,050
Google something.
What was that?

759
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,943
Um,
the store recently where they were 

760
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,104
talking about child brides somewhere in 
some country where they were trying to 

761
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:31,540
allow people to be married as young as 
11 and that up until recently they could

762
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,374
do that.
They could be married as young as 11 

763
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,710
pounds.
It's A.

764
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:36,550
Yeah,
it's a state.

765
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,710
Where's that just?
Is it.

766
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,390
Is it a state?
No.

767
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,470
Sierra Leone.
Is that what it is?

768
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,260
The article I just came up from 
yesterday?

769
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,520
Yes,
that's it.

770
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,940
What age is it?
Didn't pop up.

771
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:55,760
I'm trying to see.
What I'm trying to say is like,

772
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,590
this is obviously just ask.
Sorry.

773
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:59,270
There's actually another one for 
Missouri.

774
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,503
What's two hours ago?
I built to restrict child marriage and 

775
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:03,620
Missouri moves forward.
It says,

776
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,543
oh,
I didn't see that one child marriage in 

777
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,960
Missouri because people are fighting for
it.

778
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:09,580
That like,
yeah,

779
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,450
my baby should be able to get married at
12 years old.

780
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

781
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,330
Once you get married and he's not having
sex anymore,

782
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,164
so it's all day fucking parents idea.
It's not little kids clamoring to get 

783
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:20,690
married.
Bill to restrict child marriage.

784
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,490
Missouri moves forward.
Whoa.

785
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,060
Hold the 15 year old.
Wow.

786
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:31,061
The only state that requires only of one
parent for 15 year old to marry has made

787
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,470
the state a popular destination for 
child bride.

788
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:41,450
That is so good job to the best child.
Broad Getaway,

789
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,213
Missouri in Missouri is defense.
That's the only time they've ever been 

790
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:47,880
referred to as a popular destination.
So they're.

791
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,640
They're doing what they can to attract 
tourists.

792
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,570
Yeah,
that's dark.

793
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,690
That's dark because those places where 
like,

794
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:54,524
you know,
professions are like moss gathering and 

795
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,680
making some sort of sap juice.
You don't.

796
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:03,800
I'm like,
you can't marry a 15 year old though.

797
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,380
They can marry each other.
I'd imagine it's statutory rape is that,

798
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,040
you know,
there was a state where male to female,

799
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,000
the girl had to be 18,
but male to male,

800
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,130
the boiling had to be 13.
Well,

801
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,630
that's a little bit of a gap.
It was one of the states where they were

802
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,483
pedophiles.
The Catholic Church was sending 

803
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,850
pedophiles kind of want to say it's New 
Mexico.

804
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,860
New Mexico had some super fucking 
squirrely laws.

805
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,860
Hundreds of childhood brides in Arizona.

806
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,620
Wow.
Arizona as child brides.

807
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,263
There's a bum fuck of every state.
I don't know how to Google this because 

808
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:48,500
I think that is one of those states want
to say it's New Mexico,

809
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:52,940
but it might not have been where you.
The mail could be 18 or the male.

810
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:56,930
Could be a 13 man.
Jamie's computers just going to have the

811
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,640
most fucked up search history on the 
computer.

812
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,430
Where can I find a 13 year old boy to 
Mary.

813
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,090
How about,
what about male to female?

814
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,300
Shouldn't that be different?
I kind of like boy to girl,

815
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:11,570
meaning like woman to to 14 year old 
kid.

816
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:12,763
I do.
I think that's kind of different like 

817
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,310
the dogma of like there's no difference 
between the sexes or shit like that.

818
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,200
It's ridiculous.
And then like I don't,

819
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,750
I definitely don't think.
I'm not saying it's cool,

820
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,703
but when you hear about some hot chick 
teacher who was fucking her teenage 

821
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,780
students,
I definitely don't look at that the same

822
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,230
way that I look at some dude who's 
fucking teenage.

823
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,063
Like that's just a more fucked up.
I look at it as like she's a little bit 

824
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:40,020
more fucked up because I don't ever talk
to women that are like,

825
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,700
oh young dude,
that's what I'm into.

826
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,740
And you are you talking to every dude 
behind the scenes?

827
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,260
Like,
Oh yeah,

828
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,630
19 year old tractor,
that'll be hot.

829
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,250
You know,
she's definitely fucked up,

830
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,120
but those women play very important 
roles in,

831
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,930
in taking a young man's hand reading of 
sexuality.

832
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,170
It's not like I got molested by a 21 
year old when I was 13.

833
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,930
She was hot and it was great.
Period.

834
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,143
Dick.
She made out with me like the whole 

835
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:06,060
deal.
I,

836
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,440
I didn't,
I couldn't get a hard on.

837
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,030
I was a full panic.
I couldn't lose.

838
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,600
I was making out with this lady.
What was she babysitting?

839
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,040
You know,
she lived down the street.

840
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,480
Nice,
nice person.

841
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,540
She played softball with us and was 
fucked a bunch of us when she was 21 and

842
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:21,781
the thing is,
man,

843
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,250
she was pretty.
It was weird.

844
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,510
She was fucked when she was a kid I 
think could be anything.

845
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,860
It's always passed down from a another 
generation.

846
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:30,150
No,
you're probably right.

847
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,153
You know,
whatever.

848
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,680
She was very nice.
She was very.

849
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,600
She was a fun person.
She was fun to be around.

850
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:40,560
We all,
we all liked her,

851
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:41,650
but she fucked everybody.
Yeah.

852
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,680
So I just adore now.
I didn't,

853
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,950
I didn't know.
She just grabbed my dick.

854
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,330
Like I said,
I couldn't even get it up.

855
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,760
I panicked,
but I didn't.

856
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,590
I mean they didn't even know what 
getting it up was like.

857
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,050
I think she was the first person ever 
kissed.

858
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:58,920
You didn't come back around to her 
though later to see where you stepped up

859
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,690
and moved.
We moved,

860
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,590
we wound up moving into the next year 
and I went to high school in a different

861
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:05,424
part of town.
I was already jerking off for years at 

862
00:37:07,381 --> 00:37:10,230
that point it's giving it up.
Literally jerking off from where I was,

863
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:12,880
like nine or eight.
He started jerking off at night.

864
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,410
Hey,
I about my teddy bears and my pillows.

865
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,270
Is that the same as jerking off to it?

866
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,123
Because then I would use my hand.
I was like 10 and I remember I remember 

867
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:28,680
the transition of not coming anything to
when I actually shot a liquid and it was

868
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:32,640
like I graduated in masturbation because
I'd watched porn at that point,

869
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,260
but it's like an eighth grade 
graduation.

870
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,410
It's not the real graduated,
just kinda like,

871
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:37,244
you know,
we're trying to make them feel good 

872
00:37:37,711 --> 00:37:38,544
about himself.
So I just jerk off until after I'd had 

873
00:37:40,421 --> 00:37:41,460
sex.
No,

874
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,100
really?
I didn't start jerking off until after I

875
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:47,700
had sex.
I have no idea why either.

876
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,060
Somewhere between 15 and 16.
It might've been 16.

877
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,440
It might've been 15.
I'm not sure.

878
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,940
Then you were like,
I want to feel this again.

879
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,610
I don't have time to find a chicken.
Everything is like I.

880
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,500
When I started jerking off I went,
oh this is what's going on.

881
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:05,510
Like I'm a junkie.
Like my body is like,

882
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:10,410
like completely addicted to the idea of 
girls.

883
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,900
Right?
You're 17 years old or whatever the fuck

884
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,530
I was 15 years old.
Your body's just like girls,

885
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,080
girls.
But if you jerk off it's like Oh,

886
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,320
they're just just people without the 
need for coming.

887
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,150
Like then you'd like them based on their
merits,

888
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:34,220
their job.
But if you just.

889
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,100
Joe,
I realized that literally

890
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
when I was 16 years old,
if I just jerked off like what I was 

891
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,550
willing to tolerate with so much less we
will do.

892
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,384
When you go.
We talking about the sexual robots 

893
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,390
before and if,
if we kind of got off on a.

894
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,550
If pedophiles should be able to fuck,
I mean,

895
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:51,370
you kind of think about that.
Do they have that built up pedophile,

896
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:52,204
full balls,
walking around just seeing kids just 

897
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,590
given up on them.
There's no way to fix that.

898
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,320
I think their disease,
I think there's like a sickness.

899
00:38:59,321 --> 00:39:01,450
I don't know if you could like,
I don't know if be able to fix them.

900
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:03,940
I think when you even chemical 
castration show like that.

901
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,590
That's crazy.
Yeah.

902
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:06,490
I don't know.
I mean,

903
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:07,111
uh,
I don't,

904
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:07,944
I don't know what the.
Like there are people that have this 

905
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:11,584
inclination that would never act on it 
and an ethics and morals they want to 

906
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:17,050
fuck anybody up,
which is also crazy.

907
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,920
It's like,
wow.

908
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,280
Okay.
So it's like a nuclear suitcase.

909
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:22,114
He just walking around neighborhoods 
just ready to detonate buildings and we 

910
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,860
just trust that he's never going to use 
it.

911
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:28,990
Right.
It's a weird thing to want.

912
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,750
Or if you can get like a weird video 
game,

913
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,584
like you're hunting video game and he 
just swallow up a building with a 

914
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,310
suitcase once in a while.
But here's the thing,

915
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:39,610
like if he doesn't do anything,
he's not a criminal,

916
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,780
like if he has this thing and he fights 
this demon every day and he successfully

917
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,450
slays at every day,
who are we to come in and say,

918
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,280
you shouldn't have these thoughts.
No.

919
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:52,320
If anything I look at that is probably.
It's somebody who was abused as a child,

920
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,880
is had a horrible life and isn't harming
anybody else.

921
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,830
You almost kind of are like,
honestly,

922
00:39:56,831 --> 00:40:00,810
it's chemical castration,
two wolves.

923
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,150
We've got to find the dexter of 
terrorists terror,

924
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,670
a terrorist who only terrorizes 
terrorists.

925
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,423
Pedophiles who only goes after,
like located deserve to be a quantum 

926
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,220
leap to another city.
Like quantum leap.

927
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,143
What a crazy sickness that you can 
implant in someone's mind that if you 

928
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:25,480
can molest them,
they will want to molest others.

929
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,910
Vampires.
Yeah.

930
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,180
Yeah.
I mean really is.

931
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,300
It really is like a vampire thing.
Do not invite a pedophile into your home

932
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,940
to probably is where it comes from.
Right?

933
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,290
Like stealing your joy,
sucking the life out of your family less

934
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,870
than your kid and just being violent in 
general.

935
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,960
I think it's like that.
I think most people who are like,

936
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,990
like a not violent and like the criminal
sentence,

937
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:46,630
not in like,
you know,

938
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,640
being like in martial arts or something 
like that,

939
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,380
but like people who like,
you know,

940
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:55,381
assault and Kale and shit like that.
It's like I think 99 percent of the time

941
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,400
they were fucking beaten as a child.

942
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,233
They always kicks his ass,
but those guys can go play a video game 

943
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:03,844
where they shoot people in the fucking 
head and they get off on that and 

944
00:41:05,651 --> 00:41:09,370
pedophiles don't have that same type of 
outlet that those guys have.

945
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,720
Yeah,
that's interesting,

946
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,100
isn't it?
So isn't.

947
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,910
It's we look at pedophiles is almost 
being worse than murder,

948
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,890
right?
Like somebody wants to commit murder.

949
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:20,870
We understand it kind of is worse than 
murder and we're like,

950
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,270
I had a five year old.
I'm telling you right now,

951
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,930
like is it worse than somebody killing 
him?

952
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,490
It's,
it's no,

953
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,880
not making him crazy.
Like if someone just killed,

954
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:32,770
like if someone has a distressing,
so sexy

955
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,813
you blue hair,
it was like who is making the sexy 

956
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,273
clothes

957
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,520
into one of those beauty pageants?
Never been to a little,

958
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,423
little tiny kids.
What Diaz and Duncan were in Dallas 

959
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,733
wants and we're going.
We were working at the Addison Improv 

960
00:41:59,111 --> 00:42:02,220
and while we're in Dallas,
in our hotel,

961
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,413
they had this childhood beauty pageant.
It was the craziest shit you've ever 

962
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:07,584
seen in your life.
I'm talking about like five year olds 

963
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:10,104
with full makeup and like dresses,
but they're dressed like a woman with 

964
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:17,040
high heels.
They're walking around in high heels.

965
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:21,240
He's little tiny kids.
I mean high heels come fuck me.

966
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:24,890
Pumps like it's crazy looking at them 
and you're,

967
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:25,724
you're looking at these like super 
dolled up and that's essentially the 

968
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:30,390
Jonbenet Ramsey story.
Right?

969
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,393
You know when,
when Jonbenet Ramsey where they did an 

970
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,324
autopsy on her,
they found out that she had been 

971
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:37,560
sexually active.
Yes.

972
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,521
And she was,
what,

973
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:43,521
seven or something like on killed her.
It was something like seven killed her.

974
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,490
Some say it was the dad.
Some say it was someone out brother,

975
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,670
the brother.
He said that stories horseshit.

976
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,260
He's like,
you guys are monsters.

977
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:53,094
My sister was fucking killed and you're,
you're blaming me and I didn't do a 

978
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,060
goddamn thing.
Well,

979
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,003
he should really be upset at God because
it doesn't look like a guy who fucked 

980
00:42:59,691 --> 00:43:00,600
and killed his sister.

981
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,320
For sure.
Poor bastard.

982
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:05,154
Magic grown up your whole life knowing 
that someone fucked and killed your 

983
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:08,214
sister.
Yeah,

984
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,650
he's got a crazy big uh,
yeah.

985
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,493
No,
it be jealous too because they give her 

986
00:43:11,911 --> 00:43:13,620
more attention the whole time.
It's like Marcia,

987
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:14,311
Marcia,
Marcia,

988
00:43:14,311 --> 00:43:16,140
the end,
my favorite.

989
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,200
My favorite theory is the brother did it
by accident and the parents try to cover

990
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:22,284
it up,
but that's just my favorite documentary 

991
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:26,910
answer.
They connected the handwriting.

992
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,773
They were trying to connect the 
handwriting of the ransom note or 

993
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:34,530
whatever the fuck it was.
The one whatever note was left behind.

994
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,364
There was a note left behind and they 
said it was really similar to the 

995
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:41,020
mother's handwriting.
They cuddled ticket.

996
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,140
They made a conclusive decision about 
that,

997
00:43:43,141 --> 00:43:43,974
but that's like what if you have normal 
hand writing somebody else's normal 

998
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,023
handwriting and they kill your kid and 
now people think you killed your kid 

999
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:50,670
because you're right.
Normal.

1000
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,690
You know what I mean?
How,

1001
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,523
like you got to defend the fact that you
like put a little curve on the younger 

1002
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,180
your is handwriting Shit.
I mean does it.

1003
00:43:57,181 --> 00:43:58,560
That is it that good?

1004
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,843
I didn't find a handwriting expert that 
if you pay them enough they'll say that 

1005
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,000
it's not sure,
but that's all bullshit guys and whoever

1006
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:07,250
you get.
But there's gotta be some science behind

1007
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,084
it.
There must be looped if you ever like 

1008
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,263
seen them analyze.
It's I've seen like undocumented is and 

1009
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,380
how they analyze it,
it's like they loop it that way the same

1010
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:16,760
way.
It's all at the same angles,

1011
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,650
but they will,
they will use that in courts.

1012
00:44:18,651 --> 00:44:19,484
Right.
But I don't think it's substantial 

1013
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,830
evidence.
Polygraphs,

1014
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:22,683
like there's some science to it,
but it's not like you can't get 

1015
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:27,170
convicted off that.
I couldn't believe anybody that passed a

1016
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,160
polygraph test.

1017
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,050
You'd see it up on the screen up.
There's

1018
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:32,893
a Jonbenet Ramsey,
John Ramsey's ransom note and patty 

1019
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:41,391
Ramsey and you watch how she writes and 
you watch how rent Patty Patsy,

1020
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,520
Patsy Ramsey writes and you're like,
oh yeah,

1021
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,150
of this.
She didn't even try to hide it.

1022
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:49,550
Well,
I mean she writes the same way,

1023
00:44:49,551 --> 00:44:52,140
the ages of the same.
If you look at the end of the age yet,

1024
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,190
we'll look at the size of the a's and 
the seas.

1025
00:44:55,191 --> 00:44:56,024
They're very,
very uniform in size from hers to the 

1026
00:44:59,181 --> 00:45:01,670
ransom note,
but very different than John's

1027
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,980
like it's a,
it's a like,

1028
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,240
it's her handwriting.
Like now I see it.

1029
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,140
She killed us.
Have those words and it looks.

1030
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,830
I mean it really,
really looks like she wrote that note.

1031
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,773
So the one,
the patsy Ramsey at ransom note in the 

1032
00:45:17,411 --> 00:45:19,090
middle is the one where she said,
look,

1033
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,360
it's not my handwriting.
Right?

1034
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,090
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.

1035
00:45:22,091 --> 00:45:22,924
They made her write.
The brands like that started talking 

1036
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,870
about it.
The sheet of paper.

1037
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,733
Yeah.
They said here's some words we'd like 

1038
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:31,294
you to write them out.
And she wrote them out pretty much 

1039
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:37,030
exactly the same way.
I mean she didn't even try to hide it.

1040
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:42,720
That's crazy.
Now I get it.

1041
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:43,410
Okay.
So then,

1042
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,500
I mean I'm sure if we had an expert in 
here that he explained that there's some

1043
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:48,090
sort of science behind it.
Yeah.

1044
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,373
That house,
I lived in boulder nine fucking years 

1045
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,980
ago and that house is still for sale.
Oh,

1046
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,470
you can't sell it.
It's a nice house.

1047
00:45:58,471 --> 00:45:59,304
They can't sell that house.
He changed the name of the street like 

1048
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,500
Trent Reznor.
Marilyn Manson donor doesn't want to buy

1049
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,060
you.
Like rockstars are like really weird,

1050
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,610
like eccentric people that want to like 
have something like that.

1051
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,533
No,
nobody wants to buy a house where a kid 

1052
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,030
was killed.
Good enough deal.

1053
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,400
How expensive is it?
It's a good deal.

1054
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,970
Not a great deal.
A great deal,

1055
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,930
but you might be able to negotiate the 
deal.

1056
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,730
Mike.
Dude,

1057
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,563
I know you mentioned a crazy fucking 
like you're on stage in the middle of 

1058
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:30,100
the show and you see like things behind 
you.

1059
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,050
Ghosts.
You know,

1060
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,590
that's the thing about the comedy store 
podcasts down that basement,

1061
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,100
like debate that paid millions of people
been killed in that piece of it.

1062
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,230
That was like Bugsy Siegel's place,
those Ciro's nightclub.

1063
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,440
So like for sure if you're going to kill
somebody,

1064
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:49,680
you kill him in the basement.
Right?

1065
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,870
How many guys do you think they killed 
in that basement?

1066
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,120
Bugsy Siegel with a nightclub on sunset 
for sure.

1067
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:58,013
A gang of people.
There's probably a bunch of people 

1068
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,900
killed as it since it's been the comedy 
store.

1069
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,290
Well,
there's probably been.

1070
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,163
Well,
we know there's one that took place in 

1071
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:08,410
the base patio or the front pad.
Yeah.

1072
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,450
Yeah.
That was.

1073
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,280
I was on my way there that night.
That was crazy.

1074
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,810
Yeah.
Great Alibi,

1075
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,670
Jay.
I was on my way.

1076
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,403
I was on my way.
Me and Louis go holding a newspaper and 

1077
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:23,850
a car near the streets are many miles 
away.

1078
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,240
Louis j Gomez get

1079
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,850
it right for the press release and 
right.

1080
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,290
Yeah.
I,

1081
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,123
I,
whenever some reason their documentary 

1082
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,990
comes out about an old thing that I've 
heard a thousand things about.

1083
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,183
I'll still watch them again.
I've got way deep into Charles Manson 

1084
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:43,030
again because I was going to say Charles
Manson was.

1085
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:44,860
People have bought those houses for 
sure.

1086
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,830
Houses sold over and over again.
I'm telling you right now.

1087
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,510
Yeah,
that's true.

1088
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:50,343
They haven't marketed that fucking house
the right way because they could get 

1089
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:55,180
some Weirdo to buy it in Amityville 
horror house.

1090
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,310
Those bullshit,
like nothing ever really happened there,

1091
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:00,010
right?
It depends on what document are you.

1092
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:00,820
I mean,
some people are like,

1093
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,520
the whole thing is fake.
It's all fake.

1094
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,383
I think it's kind of bullshit.
I think they just sort of concocted it 

1095
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,680
for that movie.
I went to see that movie.

1096
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,260
I was scared out of my fucking mind.
I was thinking,

1097
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,640
oh my God,
these people,

1098
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:15,910
they bought this house and it's haunted.
Fuck man.

1099
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,650
That sucks.
What if that was us?

1100
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:21,230
If you're a little kid and then you 
found it.

1101
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,480
What based on true events means,
like I heard a weird creek in the middle

1102
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,050
of the night,
like bees came out of your toilet.

1103
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,630
I'm gonna.
Go ahead and change them.

1104
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:37,420
But then at a bees came out of the wall,
started bleeding.

1105
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,390
I grew up so poor that like just the 
idea of buying a house.

1106
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:41,470
I was watching those movies.
I was like,

1107
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,790
I don't know.
What do you want me to say guys?

1108
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:44,260
I'm renting.
We're on section eight.

1109
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,350
I would fucking deal with the ghosts 
telling them something.

1110
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:48,184
Yeah,
I know right where you scared a few 

1111
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:52,000
ghosts would have ever done and never 
killed anybody.

1112
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,820
A little bit of a fucking ghost killed 
them.

1113
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,830
No one's ever died from a ghost.
Yeah.

1114
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,673
It's always like they moved the toy car 
like across a table or something like 

1115
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:02,170
that.
How you get past that shit.

1116
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,580
People.
I had my mom,

1117
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,030
my roommate back when I was 21,
my buddy Jimmy detail you,

1118
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,280
me and him got a [inaudible] board once.
We said,

1119
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:10,730
all right,
we're going to find out this bullshit,

1120
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,180
and he's like,
you're not going to move it right.

1121
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,560
And I go,
I'm not going to move it.

1122
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,693
I go,
you're not going to move it as I'm not 

1123
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:17,044
gonna move that fucking thing.
It was where to find out this is 

1124
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:19,204
bullshit.
And we sat around for like an hour and 

1125
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:24,640
45 minutes of this fucking stupid weegee
board ask any questions.

1126
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,150
Sitting there looking at me and he 
wasn't even.

1127
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,270
He wasn't even budget at the end of it.
My friend Jimmy,

1128
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:34,690
he folds everything off,
stuffs it in a garbage bag.

1129
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,310
He goes,
I'm taking this piece of shit out to the

1130
00:49:36,311 --> 00:49:40,070
trash right now.
I mean,

1131
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,030
people convince themselves of 
everything.

1132
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,680
You know,
the start moving that thing like,

1133
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,820
oh my God,
it's going to the a I can't believe.

1134
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,260
And the end and the d is telling us 
something,

1135
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,103
Andy from beyond the grave.
It's like fake martial arts where 

1136
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:59,340
they're using fucking knock you down and
they all just fits it.

1137
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:02,090
It's the same people that,
uh,

1138
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,690
that prey on them are predators.
Do you think like,

1139
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,130
the people who go,
I'm talking to you.

1140
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,510
It's too,
that's the problem.

1141
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,730
They actually pieces of shit.
They're both,

1142
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,120
there's pieces of shit that,
some of them are just con artists.

1143
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,020
Some of them are idiots who are fooled 
by it as what they're teaching.

1144
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:18,700
I mean,
that's Sylvia Brown,

1145
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:23,290
wasn't she the one that told the girls 
they found in Cleveland,

1146
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,680
like told one of her parents.
She's moved on to a better place now and

1147
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,610
right?
Yeah.

1148
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,783
Did they have stop looking for your 
daughter was dead and she was at a 

1149
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:32,130
fucking.
That's crazy.

1150
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:34,250
She made them stop looking for 
different.

1151
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:35,580
Is that than religion though?
So I,

1152
00:50:35,581 --> 00:50:36,414
you know,
I can sit there and the person that's 

1153
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:40,340
doing that on a dumb fucking stage more 
personal.

1154
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,160
Yeah,
no religion.

1155
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,770
You are basically,
you're,

1156
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,600
you're projecting these ancient stories,
right?

1157
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,590
That's what you're doing.
You're,

1158
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:50,960
you're giving lessons in these ancient 
stories,

1159
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,430
but when you're actually doing it to a 
single person that seems way worse.

1160
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:56,264
Right?
It's very focused and also religion 

1161
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,900
people get,
there are good intentions.

1162
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:00,763
Sometimes the people doing it.
That's tradition and stuff where you 

1163
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:04,400
grow up that way and you just kind of 
like.

1164
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,230
But I know that's like,
that's,

1165
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,153
that's predatory.
They're looking for someone to make 

1166
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,740
money by exploring like the worst 
possible thing about their life in terms

1167
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,800
of is it truth?
They're both equally probably,

1168
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,380
you know,
like bullshit,

1169
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:18,223
but one is directly targeting and 
fucking with somebody also probably 

1170
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,423
killed millions and millions and 
millions of people and these people are 

1171
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,340
just fucking stupid.
A few idiots out of there.

1172
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,260
But those idiots deserve to be duped.
I mean,

1173
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,094
look,
wounded antelopes should not go to the 

1174
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,250
waterhole.
That's just how it goes.

1175
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,550
You get jack everything isn't antelope 
analogy.

1176
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,473
You Gel well.
This is dumb as they're supposed to get 

1177
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:41,120
taken out.
Did you,

1178
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:44,630
uh,
did you watch the documentary and honest

1179
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:45,464
liar about the amazing.
Randy would go pick apart those 

1180
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,940
televangelists and like interrupt their 
frequency and expose their tricks.

1181
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,520
Well,
he's one of those to a Uri Geller.

1182
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:57,760
He just tried to end him.
Peter,

1183
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,530
Steve Martin.
That's the entire.

1184
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,583
No,
no,

1185
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:04,490
it's all based off of it.
So they try to intercept that signal,

1186
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,380
but he did it with a lot of things.
Uri Geller,

1187
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,590
the bending spoons guy made him go away 
for about 20 years.

1188
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:12,680
Well,
he's got this a million dollar challenge

1189
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,040
and I believe Said,
look up the randy challenge.

1190
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,033
It's to show him any evidence of any 
sort of telekinetic powers or psychic 

1191
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:27,560
abilities,
any measurable psychic abilities and you

1192
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,290
can win a million bucks because nobody 
can show shit.

1193
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,100
Well,
he did.

1194
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,870
He did.
He did a study,

1195
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:33,704
I believe at Princeton University that 
gave him all this money to have these 

1196
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,440
guys come.

1197
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:37,840
Anyhow,
he just,

1198
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,450
he hired three other magicians and it 
was to have them come sit there for days

1199
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,284
and try to figure out how to do this 
crazy telekinetic thing and then they 

1200
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,600
ended up doing it and there was a big 
press conference and he was like,

1201
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:49,940
they're all magicians.
There's no telekinesis goes,

1202
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,320
hey,
just show that it was a trick.

1203
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:52,154
They all did and they got like 10 guys.
Some of those guys are fucking 

1204
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:56,610
incredible.
Well,

1205
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:58,790
I did that show Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

1206
00:52:58,791 --> 00:52:59,624
We did an episode on psychics and we got
this guy named bandit check and he's a 

1207
00:53:02,871 --> 00:53:05,810
vegas magician.
He's a wizard dude.

1208
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,400
He does all the spoon bending shit in 
front of you and you know what it is,

1209
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:11,151
man.
I mean,

1210
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:13,100
he didn't explain it to me.
I had to go and Google it.

1211
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,150
It's not really the same metal.
It's some metal that if you just heat it

1212
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:19,700
up by moving your hands back and forth,
it just bends.

1213
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,110
I used to want to be a magician as a 
kid.

1214
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:22,450
I really did.
And there's,

1215
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,420
if you take it like a cheap enough spoon
and you literally just a,

1216
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,100
you could bend

1217
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,440
it like a few times and it'll just look 
straight.

1218
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,513
That's one of the trucks.
We'll just use your finger and you make 

1219
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:31,704
it melt away.
But this is a very specific kind of 

1220
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,720
metal.
They do this too.

1221
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,720
It's like,
you know.

1222
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,560
But aluminum is like super weak in some.
Some forms,

1223
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,450
not like car frame forms,
but in some forms of not alloys.

1224
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,973
Aluminum is it scratches easier.
It's like there's metals that are like 

1225
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,920
our lead.
I was thinking of lead scratches easier.

1226
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:53,280
It's like a,
it's kind of metal that's pliable.

1227
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:55,650
You can bite into a gold coin,
right?

1228
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,750
You can actually see teeth marks.
That's all people knew.

1229
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,250
The goal was real.
This shit.

1230
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,560
He just rubbed your fingers and it just 
droops.

1231
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,540
It just gives in.
I spent.

1232
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,703
But no,
you guys made this remarkably well for 

1233
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,190
four microphones,
podcast.

1234
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,520
That would've never happened in a 
million years.

1235
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,560
It was just screaming at each other.
Faggot for them.

1236
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,500
We're on our best behavior right now to 
this is church Sunday for us.

1237
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,070
After you faggots first.
No,

1238
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,490
I'm just saying,
can you imagine like precise science,

1239
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,560
how much people got freaked out by 
people who like new magic or new,

1240
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,370
some type of slight of hand like that.
When you can look at Google,

1241
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,540
you can google that.
Oh,

1242
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:37,374
there's a different type of metal that 
you can burn them and just like he is 

1243
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,194
communicating with those people didn't 
know how to ask you questions that are 

1244
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:49,110
leading you into telling them the 
answers.

1245
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,690
Right?
Those techniques to that.

1246
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:52,524
You know,
I talked to Penn Jillette about that 

1247
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:56,370
once and he was explaining to me how 
when someone talks to you,

1248
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:57,383
they get you to give them the answer and
then they say the answer and it makes 

1249
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:01,880
them look like a wizard,
but they're just,

1250
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,020
they've gone through these patterns so 
many times.

1251
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,610
I mean,
how many people have problems with their

1252
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:06,444
dad?
How many people have a brother that 

1253
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:09,000
died?
How many people you know,

1254
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:10,410
they like,
there's someone missing.

1255
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,300
Who is my brother?
Yes,

1256
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,190
I see.
I see.

1257
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,960
And this is not a good thing.
Oh yes,

1258
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,470
I see.
Yeah,

1259
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:24,880
I see that he loves you.
And he misses you and he's very sad that

1260
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:25,860
he didn't get to say goodbye.

1261
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,400
He doesn't.
And then he comes home.

1262
00:55:29,401 --> 00:55:30,234
He goes,
dude,

1263
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,660
she knew about my brother getting out 
fucking dummy.

1264
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,670
You knew about your brother.
She was.

1265
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,600
She'd tell you about some shit that 
hasn't happened yet.

1266
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,733
She's telling you about some shit you 
already know because you're a dumb ass 

1267
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:45,580
and you're playing checkers with the 
ladies playing chess on you.

1268
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,323
My friend who I stayed with when I'm out
here has a very good friend who's a 

1269
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:52,960
psychic medium.
He's a very nice guy,

1270
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:53,794
but she,
she really wants to believe in him so 

1271
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:59,410
much and I'm farm the way he does is an 
entertaining thing.

1272
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,780
And she's like,
you don't believe it at all.

1273
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:03,340
I go,
here's why I don't believe it.

1274
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:08,680
If you have fucking powers.
And then also like,

1275
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:09,514
you know,
you go to target because you need 

1276
00:56:10,211 --> 00:56:11,021
shampoo.
I don't know.

1277
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:14,860
It seems like it would be a burden to 
live with the gift of magic powers.

1278
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,450
And then you're just like,
oh yeah,

1279
00:56:16,451 --> 00:56:18,430
I'll swing by Mcdonald's.
I'm a little hungry for a snack.

1280
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:22,410
It all stems from US walking around,
wouldn't

1281
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,250
it be much if I knew exactly

1282
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,083
what was going to happen,
knew who these people who's good and 

1283
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:29,800
who's bad when that'd be better than 
everybody has that feeling,

1284
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:34,750
but nobody has those abilities.
So you go on knowledge and instincts and

1285
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:35,584
life experience and you compile it 
altogether and some people are really 

1286
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:41,350
good at it and some people suck at it 
and the people that suck at it,

1287
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:42,363
they'd go to someone else for advice and
one of the ways they go to advice that 

1288
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,330
lady with the neon sign,
Psychic,

1289
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:48,580
oh look at the palm.
She must be a magician.

1290
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,930
I go in there and this is you.
I see it in New York City.

1291
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:53,690
You'll walk down the street,
there's a psychic,

1292
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:58,480
has a window of storefront palm glowing 
in the and you're like,

1293
00:56:58,570 --> 00:56:59,110
well,
I don't have them.

1294
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:01,480
How are you affording the fucking rent 
here?

1295
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,190
They get a bunch of suckers and the one 
thing about is is if they're good,

1296
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,990
if you have a good connection with that 
sucker,

1297
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,850
that soccer wants to come back next 
week.

1298
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,020
Soccer wants to keep coming to you like 
you.

1299
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:12,893
We have to discuss this.
Can you be here Thursday also part of 

1300
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,960
the job.
No problem.

1301
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,913
And then this fucking Dork,
he's all excited about Thursday on 

1302
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,704
Thursday,
the Magnum is going to take my company 

1303
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,940
and this fucking Dude Shit have gotten 
taken out by a Hyena high initiative,

1304
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:29,680
clipped his ankles,
dragged him,

1305
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,553
and they all would have jumped out of 
nowhere and mall this fucking asshole 

1306
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,870
because he didn't listen to anybody,
but no,

1307
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,520
we survive in this world.
Yes.

1308
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,383
Nature had an answer for this guy.
But then the one smart guy who was 

1309
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:45,460
supposed to survive invented some shit 
and then told everyone else about it.

1310
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,294
And now these guys have that invention.
It you wrote like an old bit of yours 

1311
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:50,284
where you touched on this.
I really fucking love that joke where 

1312
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:52,680
you're like,
uh,

1313
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,513
uh,
when you realize there's no such thing 

1314
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:55,870
as adults like everyone else.

1315
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,390
That was a real moment with me because 
people.

1316
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,224
But that's what it is.
That none of us really know what the 

1317
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:01,084
fuck's going on.
We all like to to comfort ourselves by 

1318
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,414
thinking we know what's going on,
and then if someone else can convince 

1319
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:07,810
you,
they kind of know what's going on.

1320
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,640
It's like we look for that.
Like were like,

1321
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,110
oh,
thank God I found someone now.

1322
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:13,690
Now I know what's going on,
but we're all full of shit.

1323
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,250
People are followers.
That's what it is.

1324
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,310
We should look at these psychics like we
look at coyotes,

1325
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,460
they take out the dummies.
They just take.

1326
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,760
They get into the system.
They find cracks.

1327
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:27,550
They expose weakness and dummies hanging
out with dummies.

1328
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,384
Right?
So it's like the referral business and 

1329
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,260
world.
Everything dude.

1330
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,383
Oh,
and everybody wants to think that they 

1331
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:36,940
have the person.
Oh my God,

1332
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,620
she is amazing.

1333
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:43,420
She knows so much about me.
First of all,

1334
00:58:43,421 --> 00:58:45,970
when I knew her,
when I walked in the room,

1335
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,690
she touched both my shoulders and I knew
her for my whole life.

1336
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,170
Incredible.
She's an incredible and they all want to

1337
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:54,004
convince themselves that this fucking 
crazy bitch that they keep paying money 

1338
00:58:57,281 --> 00:58:59,560
to isn't just lying to them.
That's right.

1339
00:58:59,561 --> 00:59:01,090
Because it's not just that you're being 
conned.

1340
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,953
It's like you're the accomplice in the 
con you want because you're causing 

1341
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:06,574
yourself with just those kung fu videos.
Those guys want to be conned by this 

1342
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,090
touch and the guy goes flying across the
room.

1343
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:16,580
They want.
They want to be for you to have.

1344
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,420
You're working with this master.
No problem,

1345
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:20,254
Dave.
I always make the sidekick to automate 

1346
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:23,780
brown and I just pretend my ex wife is 
dead and I want to make.

1347
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:27,320
What's that one where you remember about
ghosts to automate?

1348
00:59:27,321 --> 00:59:28,154
Brown pretended to be a patrick swayze 
and they made out with Demi Moore will 

1349
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:33,830
be a boy,
but they wouldn't show.

1350
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:38,360
We'll be making out with leaning in and 
then it turned into Patrick swayze,

1351
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,990
which was weak shit.
Realistically,

1352
00:59:41,991 --> 00:59:46,991
Whoopi Goldberg was fucking French and 
heart that's making that movie today.

1353
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:52,190
I want to go about.
That will be Goldberg now I'm too heavy.

1354
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:56,340
It would just be all checks that Xyz is 
a check tail.

1355
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:00,320
That's the reboot Ronda Rousey.
Ronda Rousey is.

1356
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:06,330
Yeah.
They could remake that movie.

1357
01:00:06,331 --> 01:00:07,220
It probably.
Well one day.

1358
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,113
They definitely could.
They can make anything so doing some 

1359
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:12,110
shitty ones coming up soon.
I'm trying to remember what they are,

1360
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,900
but there's some real like,
it's too soon.

1361
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:19,490
Why would you farmers from my liking?
Like a few more of those please.

1362
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,110
Yeah,
they really thought that was going to.

1363
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:22,510
It was so cool.
The first one,

1364
01:00:22,511 --> 01:00:24,670
when they made that truck turn into that
fucking robot,

1365
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:26,880
it was the coolest thing.
Guys are making some money.

1366
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:28,080
They're making some money

1367
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:29,523
in a fucking shit ton of money.
It's like when the fast and furious 89 

1368
01:00:33,011 --> 01:00:33,990
came out,
you know,

1369
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,843
you're like,
what?

1370
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:35,980
How many have they have?

1371
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,873
They sound like I've never watched more 
than 14 minutes of one of these 

1372
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,690
lobbyists.
I have no idea.

1373
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,980
Did you ever hear Vin diesel talk about,
uh,

1374
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,270
the movies?
Like the reference where he's like,

1375
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,600
we made a multicultural movie that 
showed races working together too long.

1376
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,940
Dudes of just about like Bikini.
It's Maxim magazine,

1377
01:00:57,941 --> 01:00:58,930
man.
It's fast cars.

1378
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,210
A Bikini to one point.
One six,

1379
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:04,810
$3,000,000,000.
Just the last one.

1380
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,990
Oh my God.
And the budget was $250.

1381
01:01:07,991 --> 01:01:09,100
Million Dollars.
Wow.

1382
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:12,020
So they made three quarters a male solid

1383
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,450
budget on.
It's not even fucking crazy.

1384
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,390
It's cars driving fast.
You got ludicrous.

1385
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:21,760
He must have a lot of special effects.
Budget.

1386
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,310
That's shit's expensive.
You want to launch cars through the air.

1387
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,710
The stuff that they do is fucking 
insane.

1388
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:27,903
I mean,
I don't know how much of it's CGI and 

1389
01:01:28,781 --> 01:01:30,460
how much of it they're really dealing 
with cars,

1390
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,820
but as a person who loves muscle cars,
it hurts my heart.

1391
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,460
Watching those cars get fucking launched
through the air.

1392
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,470
Much more so many of these.
They only made so many 1969 chargers,

1393
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,530
right?
He feels that they're destroying them.

1394
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,850
I like the Dukes of hazard.
How many fucking chargers did they wreck

1395
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,930
for the Dukes of Hazzard?
Launching them across a bridge landing.

1396
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:53,764
I'm nose down.
You see the car bend drive away like 

1397
01:01:56,051 --> 01:01:56,884
nothing's happening.
How Louis Myeloma noticed and they kill 

1398
01:01:59,801 --> 01:02:00,634
like 15 years.

1399
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:02,870
It's so funny.
That movie.

1400
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,390
You remember the movie my own Otis?
Yes.

1401
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,330
Pug nose pop,
little orange cat.

1402
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,160
Fucking grateful that I got to be honest
with you.

1403
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,643
I don't think it holds up the amount of 
pugs and kittens that died during the 

1404
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:15,284
making of this film.
You have to watch it because otherwise 

1405
01:02:17,011 --> 01:02:19,470
otherwise they died in vain.
They took the,

1406
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,040
like it was

1407
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,190
another movie that was made in like 
Japan or China or somewhere in Asia.

1408
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,930
Uh,
and they didn't give a fuck.

1409
01:02:24,931 --> 01:02:25,800
There was no walls.
I'm like,

1410
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:27,780
how you treat a cats and dogs in that 
country.

1411
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:29,370
They don't care how you treat humans 
back there.

1412
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:34,950
So there's a scene where the dog is 
fighting off a bear and this bear,

1413
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:38,790
I mean they must have just went through 
30 pugs with this bear scene alone,

1414
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:41,250
but there's no confirm numbers of 
deaths.

1415
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:44,170
But there was like a bunch of other.
When you watched the movie,

1416
01:02:44,171 --> 01:02:44,970
you're like,
you're like,

1417
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:45,803
oh man,
how did they get that dog to fight with 

1418
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:47,574
that bear?
And it's like,

1419
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:48,980
well,
we lost like $300.

1420
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:53,530
That's how we did a Jesus Christ.
Really a bunch of.

1421
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:56,030
There's a scene where he's in the water 
swimming,

1422
01:02:56,650 --> 01:03:00,990
maybe eight of them right there.
How many dogs tied?

1423
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,750
We looked it up one time.
I forget a lot.

1424
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:07,830
I know Dudley Moore narrated at the 
eight in that scene.

1425
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,390
Jesus Christ.
That is so crazy.

1426
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,740
Holy Fuck,
I'm looking at the elks head behind you.

1427
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,080
Damage more value that elc has done a 
puppy.

1428
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,170
Why don't we put so much more value when
a puppy's life versus that elk slide.

1429
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,640
Cute,
cute,

1430
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,390
cute privilege.
But like you'll swap out mosquito.

1431
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,720
Yeah.
I only care about human swat mosquitoes.

1432
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,100
Yeah,
that's a good point.

1433
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:36,023
I know.
Kill plants which are living right and 

1434
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,870
that's.
I only care about humans and dogs.

1435
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,460
Love peanut butter off your dead cats 
too.

1436
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,890
I do enjoy cats.
I never liked cats,

1437
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,770
but then my girlfriend brought her mom's
cat to live with us for a little bit and

1438
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:53,250
I got attached to that fucking cat 
fiance kind of animals.

1439
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:54,084
I love them in the wild.
I love them and I just love them in 

1440
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,660
their environment.
I think it's.

1441
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,823
Look,
it is a weird thing that we've gotten 

1442
01:04:00,031 --> 01:04:03,570
totally accustomed to that you could 
just get out of this studio right now.

1443
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,020
You could drive 15,
20 minutes over to Pang cane.

1444
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,160
Get out of your car,
walk 300 yards into the woods and you're

1445
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:13,470
just living with animals,
eating animals.

1446
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:18,330
You are basically in another dimension.
There's eagles when there's not too many

1447
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:20,700
eagles,
but a lot of hawks that fly around,

1448
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:21,563
they're just constantly looking for some
shit to Jack and if either there at the 

1449
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:24,264
right time you could see it happen.
You can see a coyote snatch a rabbit or 

1450
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,553
you know,
different animals just constantly 

1451
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:32,730
looking for something else to eat.
It's right there.

1452
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,290
Yeah.
We're so removed from it.

1453
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:35,730
Like if you,
if you want to be like,

1454
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:38,670
well you put yourself out there and 
that's a big difference between New York

1455
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:39,504
and La.
Like la is the city where there's 

1456
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,693
beautiful nature within it.
New York's like just the city and then 

1457
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:45,780
you've got to leave to go to any 
beautiful.

1458
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,490
Right.
So it's almost like you can be,

1459
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:48,970
but I mean just the fact that we just 
go,

1460
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,900
you go to a grocery store and my 
relationship with animals is like,

1461
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,390
there's a steak.
Let me pick it up and buy it.

1462
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,910
And it's not.
None of them like,

1463
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,023
oh,
this came from fucking killing a cow in 

1464
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:02,900
someone.
Do you ever go to Malibu once?

1465
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,400
There's places in Malibu that it,
like ranches,

1466
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:09,150
like they're really long.
I think it's something like 30 something

1467
01:05:09,151 --> 01:05:12,090
miles of coast and along the way,
like up in the hill,

1468
01:05:12,091 --> 01:05:15,750
there's like Alpaca farms and shit like 
that and that shit.

1469
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:17,470
You could just get in your car and then 
boom,

1470
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:18,160
you're in La and

1471
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,860
then get in your car and boom,
you're in the Alpaca farm.

1472
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,430
That nature you're describing those 
scares the shit out of the hamster ball.

1473
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,303
No,
they're going to show the dog tell that 

1474
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,800
none of this is the movie.
This is from the movie,

1475
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:32,830
but this is actually having that bear 
killed that dog.

1476
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,480
Yeah.
That is so crazy.

1477
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,730
And the movie,
the bear dog fights off the bear.

1478
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,593
I know,
but that's so crazy that they allowed 

1479
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,840
this crazy.
I don't know.

1480
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,610
Like you're just like,
oh man,

1481
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,260
they must have had the best animal 
trainers.

1482
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,010
Like,
nope.

1483
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,740
They just.
We threw a dog versus a bad God.

1484
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:51,574
That's so crazy.
Imagine what the fucking pugs looked 

1485
01:05:55,421 --> 01:06:00,410
like to after bears just ripping apart.
Like twitching.

1486
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:04,030
My Buddy John.
John Dudley saw a bear.

1487
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:08,140
He saw a grizzly bear,
killed a moose with one swat.

1488
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,500
He said he had never seen anything like 
it that it was.

1489
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,950
He was looking through his by nose and 
he saw this bear swat,

1490
01:06:15,951 --> 01:06:17,710
this moose in the back and it just 
broke.

1491
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:20,680
It's back and the Moose just goes down.
A Moose.

1492
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,990
Moose are so big.
Huge.

1493
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:23,843
There are so big.
Matt said this Grizzly just fucking 

1494
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:27,214
swatted it and they saw it happen and 
that they're so powerful that swatting 

1495
01:06:32,051 --> 01:06:32,884
it in the back broke it's back and the 
thing went down and then he's just 

1496
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,023
ripping it apart.
One of my favorite pranks on my friends 

1497
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:42,490
is I send them a video and I say,
Watch A.

1498
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:43,443
Watch this.

1499
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,490
He's got a moose by the neck.
Just dragging it through the woods.

1500
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,400
Those fucking animals.
Do you want.

1501
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,550
Everyone's looking for monsters.
There's a God damn monster.

1502
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,410
That thing just killed a moose talking 
about Bj dragged into the woods.

1503
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,420
Hey,
bear [inaudible].

1504
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:05,640
My favorite pranks planned paypal is I 
send them an email and say,

1505
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,340
check out this video of this deer,
a beating up this bear,

1506
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,833
and then it's.
There's a famous video of a bear just 

1507
01:07:12,521 --> 01:07:13,354
killing a deer in the backyard,
like in the deer is making them as 

1508
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:15,994
awful,
horrible sound you'll ever hear her 

1509
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,750
entire life and Louis goes,
the deere makes a come back,

1510
01:07:19,751 --> 01:07:21,150
wait for it,
wait for it,

1511
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:21,993
and just gets people to watch the video,
watch the deer being mauled alive with 

1512
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,490
the most horrible sound and then let it 
go.

1513
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:28,463
That's the old frank.
I was hoping there was like a dude's 

1514
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:32,410
dick somewhere in the help too.

1515
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,480
To be fair,
most of has pranks.

1516
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:37,140
Do have a dude's Dick and it somewhere,
but this one is just barren,

1517
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,033
dear.
Yeah.

1518
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:38,943
That's how it goes.
Bears are different than other animals 

1519
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,950
in that they eat a lot of shit.
They eat a lot of berries,

1520
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:47,140
a lot of plants,
and they also eat animals.

1521
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:50,530
Whatever they get ahold of so they don't
kill the animal first.

1522
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:53,190
There are also real sturdy.
They're.

1523
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,960
They're not like a cat,
like cats are really powerful,

1524
01:07:55,961 --> 01:08:00,961
but cats are more flexible and pliable.
A bears more of a just a fucking machine

1525
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,850
or bears more of like a like cats are 
like hoists.

1526
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:04,601
Gracie,
a bear's,

1527
01:08:04,601 --> 01:08:05,434
Dan Henderson.
He's just coming in there throwing 

1528
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:09,520
overhand rights.
Maybe even taking people on the back.

1529
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,470
Melvin manhoef.
Just a powerhouse.

1530
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,410
Dave Henderson,
a hairy gay guy.

1531
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,040
No,
that's not the different kind

1532
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,190
of bare pro.
Oh,

1533
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,700
nature bears.
You guys say nature.

1534
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,670
Me Don't try to get me in trouble with 
Dan Henderson.

1535
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:23,583
I'm actually more like brock because 
I've learned with Frank Mir describe 

1536
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,001
rockland.
Top of him.

1537
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:26,834
He was like,
it was like a car that was slowly onto 

1538
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:30,400
him and he couldn't push it off.
Like,

1539
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,230
you know,
imagine a bears on you.

1540
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,290
You're just like sitting there like,
dude,

1541
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:36,640
it's got my shoulder blade and it's just
knowing that my shoulder blade and I'm.

1542
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,570
I know I'm going to die.
Nothing you can do.

1543
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,040
Holy Fuck.
Do you think you went,

1544
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:40,923
you're the adrenaline will kick in where
you wouldn't feel the pain or do you 

1545
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:44,270
think it would be the most horrible 
fucking.

1546
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:46,700
He definitely wouldn't feel it.
You'd feel it.

1547
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,593
It would hurt,
but you would be so terrified of death 

1548
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:50,924
and you'd be so overwhelmed with all 
these fucking neurochemicals to be 

1549
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:58,550
flying through your synapses.
You'd be out of your mind.

1550
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,620
You'd feel like the pressure of that.
It's happening.

1551
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,353
You would.
You'd.

1552
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,780
There'd be so much adrenaline.
You'd be in another dimension before you

1553
01:09:09,781 --> 01:09:10,614
knew it.
That's probably a trigger that seems 

1554
01:09:12,751 --> 01:09:16,380
like the worst way to die.
Just a guy who got bit real bad and came

1555
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:17,214
back and had a video.
He did a selfie and talked about what 

1556
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:22,790
happened.
He was just walking,

1557
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,510
hiking down a trail,
scouting,

1558
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,590
and he came upon A.
I'm a female grizzly and her cubs,

1559
01:09:28,591 --> 01:09:31,740
which is the worst scenario.
A male grizzly doesn't really,

1560
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,740
unless he's really old and it's really 
late in the season.

1561
01:09:34,741 --> 01:09:36,510
Usually they'll just get the fuck away 
from you,

1562
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,493
but the females will fuck you up and 
this female fucked him up and tore his 

1563
01:09:40,951 --> 01:09:45,720
scalp right off of his skull and he had 
it like packed down with a baseball hat,

1564
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:46,973
like try to try to hold it in place and 
his arm snapped and he had big bite 

1565
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:52,044
marks in his arm,
but this guy was like a Montana dude 

1566
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,940
like in the Montana.
Tough.

1567
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:57,833
So he's like,
well,

1568
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,040
vitals are intact.

1569
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:02,560
Might be broken.
I don't know what's going on up there.

1570
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:08,970
Holy Shit.
Fucking yoga teacher in La.

1571
01:10:12,490 --> 01:10:15,570
Safe space.
There he is.

1572
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,560
Oh my God.
Down his head.

1573
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:22,010
The grizzly with two cubs you can barely
see,

1574
01:10:22,011 --> 01:10:27,011
but the right side of his ear,
his head is basically ripped apart.

1575
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,460
I'll save my watch though.
He put the hat on to make himself like,

1576
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:36,480
you know my fucking kidding.
I never got my daddy's wash.

1577
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,950
He drove himself to the hospital after 
walking three miles to his car.

1578
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,840
That's a fucking man.
I'll.

1579
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,703
I'll be damned if I'm not going to get 
the gosh darn best facebook live video 

1580
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:46,454
out of this.
There's literally look at the size of 

1581
01:10:48,231 --> 01:10:49,990
the hole in his head.
My God,

1582
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:50,691
mother.
Fuck.

1583
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:53,480
He's smiling in the picture because he's
a fucking Montana dude.

1584
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:54,970
There are different humans.
Do you remember the,

1585
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,900
uh,
the bear with the karate suit guy?

1586
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,940
He just fucking knocks out the lady 
specials.

1587
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,130
You have a joke about that.
He remembers that.

1588
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:12,360
He tears his bitch apart.
It's horrible.

1589
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,080
And the other guy with the karate 
uniform is just decided out of nowhere.

1590
01:11:19,081 --> 01:11:19,914
Yes sir.
He just decided out of nowhere that he 

1591
01:11:22,031 --> 01:11:22,864
was going to fuck that lady up.
There was no town and nobody feels bad 

1592
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:29,790
because you put a fucking party and I 
met bear man.

1593
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,680
That ain't working.
Yeah,

1594
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:35,580
that's simple.
Simple as that I'm scared of animals do.

1595
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:37,950
And now that I have a kid too,
like is this,

1596
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,960
is the video going at the karate and 
sits down.

1597
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,110
Oh,
this is fun.

1598
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,790
Look at the size of the thing.
Like,

1599
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,970
look at the power in it.
When it grabs her lunch,

1600
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:01,050
imagine how terrified she must've been.
And everyone's slapping it,

1601
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,510
bitch slapping it.
The host is getting in there.

1602
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,553
Why would the host get in there?
Are you crazy dudes wrestling with a 

1603
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:13,090
bear that is a Russian who's that good 
technique?

1604
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:16,170
That guy has to be rushed and look at 
the power in his fucking getting.

1605
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,660
He's almost got the bear.
He's almost got the bear out.

1606
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,720
Jesus Christ.
This is so crazy.

1607
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:26,130
And the bear still holding onto that 
person was fucking that personnel also,

1608
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,780
not even the hardest day of her life in 
Russia.

1609
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,290
Oh my God.
She made.

1610
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,830
She must've got fucked up by that bear 
dude.

1611
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:33,770
I mean really fucked up.
The bear.

1612
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,540
Didn't use great technique to get out of
the team,

1613
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,383
but he just kind of powered out.
The only thing that saved her life is 

1614
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,950
that that bear had a muzzle on.
I love that.

1615
01:12:40,951 --> 01:12:45,951
He looks at her like she said something 
offensive you can't predict and that's a

1616
01:12:46,891 --> 01:12:49,350
brown bear that's similar to a grizzly 
bear.

1617
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:52,290
Probably the Russian version of a brown 
bear.

1618
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:55,330
They have big ass bears over there.
Yeah.

1619
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,010
Fuck that dude.

1620
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:56,940
Fuck bears,
dude.

1621
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:57,774
I've,
I saw a real grizzly bear in the wild 

1622
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,740
and it wasn't that far away.
There was like 30,

1623
01:13:01,741 --> 01:13:05,130
40 yards and looked me in the eyes and I
remember thinking,

1624
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,420
Whoa,
that's a different look.

1625
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:08,254
He went,
Oh shit.

1626
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,093
It's jewelry wasn't even a big one.
It was only like a six foot tall 

1627
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:12,750
grizzly,
which is not a big grizzly,

1628
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,280
but it looked at me.
It looked.

1629
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:16,320
They looked through you like,
what am I going to do?

1630
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:17,410
Am I going to eat?
You know,

1631
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,560
what am I doing?
Is it safe to safe?

1632
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:20,543
They have their brains calculated.
Do you have a weapon on you or you have 

1633
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,373
two shotguns and two bows and arrows,
but still I'd probably take a while to 

1634
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:30,600
shotguns and one bone arrow.
I got a shotgun.

1635
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,340
My Tas.
Yeah.

1636
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,340
Yes.
It would take a while.

1637
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,380
Yeah,
it's not.

1638
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,560
It's not that easy.
It's a big animal.

1639
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:41,760
Even a six foot one is probably probably
300 pounds.

1640
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:43,080
I mean,
it's a big animal,

1641
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:45,030
but it's the way they look at you that's
different.

1642
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,133
Like I've.
I've seen black bears in the wild and 

1643
01:13:47,611 --> 01:13:48,840
they look at you like,
what are you,

1644
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:50,610
what's going on over here?
What's happening?

1645
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,850
Grizzlies look right through you.
They look right through you.

1646
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:57,270
It's a weird look.
It's a weird like dead look like there's

1647
01:13:57,271 --> 01:14:00,360
no fear of you at all.
Like what do I do here?

1648
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,640
They just trying to figure out whether 
or not you're a meal.

1649
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,500
You're just wandering.
Imagined piano.

1650
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:08,160
300 pound animal that just has to wander
around looking for shit to eat.

1651
01:14:09,170 --> 01:14:10,390
Welcome to the life of big Joe.

1652
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,963
Can you please stop describing the wild 
animals conventions I've been in my 

1653
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:19,480
life.
I mean this is a fucking crazy bear.

1654
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:21,700
Like you see this thing come and run 
because it will eat.

1655
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:26,701
You are human being 300 pounds that's 
coming at you.

1656
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:30,710
All you can do is put it down,
put it out of their misery animal.

1657
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,230
Three hundred pounds that is hungry.

1658
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:35,050
Imaginary,
no stores

1659
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,250
looking for hunters and slipping.
Limps.

1660
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,630
It just like a.

1661
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,230
well we,
um,

1662
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,203
I was with my friend Jen,
she's the guide and she smacked a 

1663
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:50,014
fucking tree with the stick.
She picked up the stick and crack this 

1664
01:14:53,641 --> 01:14:54,474
fucking tree and screamed and I screamed
and we cocked our guns and that thing 

1665
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:02,780
took off.
They new fuck bitch ass.

1666
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,370
Bear Shit,
we saw a couple of them,

1667
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:08,590
so one of them we think on the side of 
the road,

1668
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,740
it's got to be terrible,
but with the weapons,

1669
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:14,650
you're like it sorta on still,
you know,

1670
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:17,590
you don't know how many are out there 
and you have them out there,

1671
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:18,350
you know,
they've,

1672
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,183
they've,
they've seen one way bigger than the 

1673
01:15:20,441 --> 01:15:21,550
ones I've seen.
Well,

1674
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:22,384
what about people that say this?
It's always like the people that are 

1675
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:24,791
like,
well,

1676
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:25,960
yeah,
if you think you're a real man,

1677
01:15:25,961 --> 01:15:26,794
how about this?
We'll give you a knife and you go out 

1678
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:29,560
there and then you try to hunt a bear.

1679
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,630
I always feel like even if you have a 
gun,

1680
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:34,780
it's going to not be that easy to just 
go and fucking kill a bear.

1681
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,673
But you know why all these people say 
that shit is because they don't 

1682
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:40,540
understand what a bear really is.
Like in their head.

1683
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,673
They feel like a bear is like some 
mythical creature who lives in the 

1684
01:15:44,501 --> 01:15:49,501
forest so she'd be left alone.
The problem is you can't just leave them

1685
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:51,004
alone because they're so powerful and 
they're so hungry and they eat so much 

1686
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:58,480
that if there's nothing that keeps them 
in check,

1687
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:00,573
they're gonna just run rampant and 
destroy all the deer and the Moose and 

1688
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,710
all those other things you like to look 
at as well.

1689
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,210
They're going to kill all of you.
They were to kill 50 percent of

1690
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,540
just you can

1691
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,050
kill them.
Well,

1692
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:13,713
you're also like,
you want to keep the populations 

1693
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,113
healthy,
like it's very tricky and humans are 

1694
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,610
supposed to play a part in this.
I mean there's.

1695
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,313
We don't like to think we play a part in
it because we can communicate and we 

1696
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:26,854
discuss things and we rationalize.
We have culture and those are all those 

1697
01:16:30,101 --> 01:16:30,934
things are all correct,
but we've always kept predators and 

1698
01:16:34,001 --> 01:16:36,940
check because when they start killing us
that means,

1699
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:38,320
oh,
we have to do something now,

1700
01:16:38,321 --> 01:16:39,154
and then we killed them.
That's always been the case with 

1701
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:45,190
villages and Jaguars and people who live
in towns and wolves.

1702
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:47,470
It's always been the case.
There is a food chain.

1703
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:50,500
We're a part of it.
We just have insulated ourselves from it

1704
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:54,340
with cities so thoroughly that we've 
forgot about this connection,

1705
01:16:54,341 --> 01:16:56,020
so all these people that are peta 
people,

1706
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,870
a good percentage of them are living in 
cities.

1707
01:16:59,230 --> 01:16:59,801
You're,
you're,

1708
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:00,634
you're talking about a culture that you 
don't understand talking about a world 

1709
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:04,773
that you I don't idealize.
And when you say like we kept the 

1710
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:10,070
predators and check like not nearly as 
well

1711
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,903
as we do now.
We always tried to do it and then after 

1712
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:13,454
thousands of years of this struggle 
where we fucking got the upper hand and 

1713
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,323
started dominating,
it was easy to sit in a city and be 

1714
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:19,680
like,
hey,

1715
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,513
you know,
you read your kids these books about 

1716
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:22,784
nature and it's like the frog made 
friends with the squirrel and 

1717
01:17:24,831 --> 01:17:27,260
everything's just nice and nature were 
the assholes.

1718
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:29,690
Like people are the assholes because we 
pollute and we do this.

1719
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:30,321
And it's like,
no,

1720
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:31,154
you know,
what's the real fucking asshole is the 

1721
01:17:32,211 --> 01:17:36,320
state of nature where your fucking kid 
gets ripped apart by a fucking predator.

1722
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,970
That's real.
That's the shit you don't want to do.

1723
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:40,660
Where's that fucking?
Bye.

1724
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:42,820
The answer is,
man,

1725
01:17:42,821 --> 01:17:43,654
I think the answer is comes in the 
middle that people have to realize the 

1726
01:17:47,190 --> 01:17:48,023
real problem on the side of people that 
eat meat and people that don't think 

1727
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:54,160
Peta people are ridiculous,
is factory farming.

1728
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:54,994
That's what's against us.
The most horrific evidence is not 

1729
01:17:57,971 --> 01:17:58,804
impeded side.
I mean in terms of like something that 

1730
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,960
they're accused of the most horrific 
evidenced by far.

1731
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,710
It's coming out of these factory farms.
Like if you had to pick like which side.

1732
01:18:08,711 --> 01:18:09,544
If you look at the two of them,
like which side makes more sense with 

1733
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:17,060
the pizza side makes way more sense than
the fucking factory farm people bolt are

1734
01:18:17,081 --> 01:18:17,914
extremists.
You see those videos where it's like 

1735
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:24,150
Auschwitz of cows and doing numbers into
their forearms.

1736
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:27,370
It's terrific.
So I think the,

1737
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,210
if the meeting population doesn't accept
the fact that this is,

1738
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:35,800
it's not just,
it's should be impossible.

1739
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,693
It should be impossible for a civilized,
healthy person to accept this as a 

1740
01:18:40,691 --> 01:18:43,900
reality for those animals.
So the Peta people are right about that.

1741
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:44,993
They just.
But the idea that you shouldn't be able 

1742
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,940
to eat any animals.
Like mmm.

1743
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:49,293
I don't agree because what are you going
to do with all these animals and the 

1744
01:18:51,731 --> 01:18:56,260
best way in terms of like health,
the best way to live is eating mammals,

1745
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:57,183
animals,
eating animals and vegetables together 

1746
01:18:58,571 --> 01:18:59,404
seems to be the best way to exist seems 
to be when you look at all these 

1747
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:04,744
objective scientific studies that talk 
about nutrients and plants versus 

1748
01:19:08,981 --> 01:19:09,814
nutrients and animal products or leans 
very heavily towards a diet that's rich 

1749
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:14,794
in of those,
there's no people in the world that are 

1750
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,284
fed that eat a meat,
vegetables and fruit juice responsible 

1751
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,513
here,
dude,

1752
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,530
fucked up man.
I know you guys are aggressive at home.

1753
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,140
That shit.
I like meat and vegetables and fruits.

1754
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,350
Joe,
he's getting your shotgun,

1755
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:31,260
right?
Like all those things.

1756
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:36,750
But so six foot son of a bitches coming 
right at Jason.

1757
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,620
Being a stick on the tree.
Guys,

1758
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,960
don't nobody.
You're right.

1759
01:19:42,961 --> 01:19:45,360
And then it's also like there's some 
weird shit that happens to you when they

1760
01:19:45,361 --> 01:19:49,200
go in those fucking Vegan soy diets like
Jamie Kilstein started eating meat again

1761
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,000
and he's fucking making sense again.
Finally.

1762
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:55,320
Well,
he also tasted the wrath of his improper

1763
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:57,180
inclinations.
Me,

1764
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:58,014
improper meaning he wasn't being honest.
He went along with his ideology because 

1765
01:20:01,921 --> 01:20:06,921
he was terrified of the repercussions of
being against the stream and you know,

1766
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,193
he saw like Jay,
I've talked about Jamie 100 times on 

1767
01:20:11,581 --> 01:20:12,414
this podcast now after we did a podcast 
together because he's a way more normal 

1768
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,410
person now.
He's way more rational.

1769
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:20,393
Like when he was in that world,
he was frantic checking his twitter 

1770
01:20:22,861 --> 01:20:25,500
constantly,
like constantly arguing with people,

1771
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,530
calling people out of being a bigot or a
racist.

1772
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:32,010
It's like you're always trying to get 
street cred for calling people out.

1773
01:20:32,011 --> 01:20:32,844
You're always constantly checking your 
phone and see what horrible shit they 

1774
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,930
said back to you and whether or not that
stings

1775
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:40,300
you're in a battle and that you almost 
get addicted to that.

1776
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,134
I quit.
I literally stopped using facebook like 

1777
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,233
six months ago.
I just deleted it because it was a lot 

1778
01:20:44,891 --> 01:20:45,724
of that.
I don't really publicly battle as much 

1779
01:20:46,811 --> 01:20:47,644
on twitter with dummies,
but on facebook I was really getting 

1780
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:52,750
into it with people for stupid shit and 
I was just like,

1781
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,690
now that I don't do that at all,
like just that weird,

1782
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,553
nasty whatever vial feeling that that 
gives you that you live in and you get 

1783
01:20:59,801 --> 01:21:01,330
addicted to,
you want to go back to it.

1784
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:05,500
It just feels so much better and Jamie 
was definitely a victim of that,

1785
01:21:05,501 --> 01:21:06,334
but now you talk to them because I had 
lunch with them before he even came 

1786
01:21:09,101 --> 01:21:09,720
back.
We talked,

1787
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:12,550
we had lunch in La and he almost seemed 
broken.

1788
01:21:12,551 --> 01:21:14,920
Dude.
He seemed like he definitely seemed like

1789
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,980
he was beaten down and had been through 
some real fucking shit.

1790
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:18,883
I think the social industry,
I think being a social justice warrior 

1791
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,553
is like exhausting.
You have to be looking at that hearing 

1792
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:27,570
is exhausting,
period.

1793
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:32,380
If inside of you give a fuck that much,
it's pretty nice.

1794
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:33,343
But I mean it really is like when people
get angry about something like calming 

1795
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,280
people get angry back comedy.
It's so like,

1796
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,213
wow,
you've had to.

1797
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,343
You've already through so many layers of
things to actually be angry about and 

1798
01:21:43,411 --> 01:21:45,750
then some other things you shouldn't be 
angry about to get to comedy.

1799
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:46,584
They're almost always not successful or 
not as successful as they think they 

1800
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:50,334
should be.
Almost always no one who's successful 

1801
01:21:52,021 --> 01:21:52,854
complaints about comedy.
No one who is successful is pissed off 

1802
01:21:55,381 --> 01:21:58,410
to.
Kevin Hart has a fucking $50,000,000

1803
01:21:58,411 --> 01:21:59,310
mansion,
right?

1804
01:21:59,630 --> 01:22:00,463
No,
you're absolutely right that aren't 

1805
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:03,840
doing well.
And I think,

1806
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:04,600
uh,
and,

1807
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,433
and just kind of on a similar note,
I think no one who's been through real 

1808
01:22:07,681 --> 01:22:10,380
shit in their life gives a fuck about 
microaggressions.

1809
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:11,503
Like it's literally like a privileged 
thing and you don't have anything going 

1810
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:18,090
on that you actually are taking this as 
a major issue,

1811
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,760
but you know what it also is,
it's evidence that you're in competition

1812
01:22:20,761 --> 01:22:21,594
with that person and unnecessarily so 
and that you are deeming them to be 

1813
01:22:25,231 --> 01:22:28,050
unworthy of their success.
So you get angry,

1814
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:29,293
you're lashing out.
And it's entirely because you feel like 

1815
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:33,950
it's a race and you're so far behind the
regular folk,

1816
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:38,490
the folk hart or whatever it is.
It's like whoever the fuck if the person

1817
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:42,390
is that's way ahead of you instead of 
just looking at it for what it is.

1818
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,620
Wow.
That guy works hard.

1819
01:22:43,621 --> 01:22:44,230
Hold on.

1820
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:46,210
Stressful at all in comedy.
You Go,

1821
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,920
oh,
this is a really fucking fair thing.

1822
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:49,120
Either way,
whether you have a,

1823
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:50,980
you know the guys that have millions of 
millions of dollars,

1824
01:22:50,981 --> 01:22:51,814
that's great.

1825
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,440
If you're successful in comedy.
Yeah.

1826
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,350
But if you're a guy coming off as like,
you know,

1827
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:56,400
it's easy.
I mean,

1828
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,590
how many times when you were around gods
were just starting out.

1829
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,500
Would they talk crazy shit on some 
headlines or they work with.

1830
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:03,030
Yeah man,
he couldn't even follow me,

1831
01:23:03,031 --> 01:23:05,890
Bro.
Everybody this room probably was

1832
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,920
guilty of doing that as a young comment 
on that.

1833
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:10,840
Me and Dave on the phone,

1834
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:15,550
I got called a audit by a Keith 
Robinson,

1835
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:16,480
the committee,
Keith Robinson.

1836
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:21,481
I called him the shit talking another 
comic or say that I like some booker had

1837
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:25,510
called and said he liked me on the show 
and he kept talking about me and another

1838
01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:27,640
comic that he liked.
This guy's gonna be comedy anymore,

1839
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,950
but he kept acknowledging.
He's like,

1840
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:30,784
oh,
just you and that guy were my two 

1841
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:32,800
favorites.
I like youtube both.

1842
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:34,690
And eventually I was like,
hey man.

1843
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:35,260
Yeah.
It's just like,

1844
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,760
that guy's terrible.
I was like,

1845
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,560
you keep saying the same thing.
It's so weird.

1846
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:40,160
And I called,
uh,

1847
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,310
my friend Keith Robinson,
Flight Brag,

1848
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,840
not brag would almost be like,
isn't this funny?

1849
01:23:43,841 --> 01:23:46,660
He kept saying,
I did this for a young comedy and he was

1850
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:47,141
like,
dude,

1851
01:23:47,141 --> 01:23:49,780
don't ever fucking do that because it's 
not your job,

1852
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:51,333
not your job to take money out of 
someone's pocket for a or just slouched 

1853
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:56,710
and whatever it goes,
if they suck that much,

1854
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:59,610
it'll people will find out or maybe 
they'll get better or whatever,

1855
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,590
but it's not your job to like cut 
somebody else off at the knees.

1856
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:03,640
And I was,
I took that soda.

1857
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:04,420
I was like,
Oh shit.

1858
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:06,550
I was,
I was a real asshole doing that.

1859
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,920
Dialyze it.
You get caught.

1860
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:12,310
I've heard that before too.
You get caught up in what you think is a

1861
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:13,144
competition,
but you knew and all the other people 

1862
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:15,424
that are trying to make it,
but there a nice point when you get to 

1863
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:18,274
at least where you're.
You're not miserably broke all the time 

1864
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:25,390
or you're in some at least path or lane 
of where you want to go.

1865
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,493
It's nice to be.
It does change your appreciation for 

1866
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:30,460
comedy.
It brings it back again.

1867
01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:32,710
It brings it back.
You can just like somebody like somebody

1868
01:24:32,711 --> 01:24:34,380
who's funny,
who's way younger than you.

1869
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:36,990
You can like somebody who's funny who's 
passing you.

1870
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,260
You know what I mean?
It doesn't matter.

1871
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,250
You can just like a.
well,

1872
01:24:39,251 --> 01:24:40,980
that was the thing that me.
Why them,

1873
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,890
not me?
Why them?

1874
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:42,973
I want you to like laughing at like 
guitar acts where I think when we all 

1875
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:47,690
came up in New York,
there's like our experts,

1876
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,660
you dumb fucking hacky shit and I'm 
watching you the other way.

1877
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,793
Washington Reagan and mock up Jeremiah 
and just laughing your Dick off because 

1878
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:56,900
you let go after a little while ago and 
it's not you,

1879
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:59,330
but it's not about your ego.
It's about what's going to tickle you.

1880
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,183
There is not about the,

1881
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,070
we've had this conversation a lot and I 
said,

1882
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:03,953
I think what New York lax,
la embrace as much more is the silly 

1883
01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:10,160
even,
you know what I mean?

1884
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:11,780
There's just,
there's not enough like silly,

1885
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,161
uh,
in New York,

1886
01:25:13,161 --> 01:25:13,994
I feel like everyone's,
if you do something silly or even pull 

1887
01:25:16,101 --> 01:25:17,570
out a guitar for whatever reason on 
stage,

1888
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,210
I think there's not even a chance of 
maybe wait,

1889
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,380
this might be like a unique or guitar,

1890
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:23,523
you know,
people will like I watched Sebastian 

1891
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:29,320
Maniscalco in Vegas and do it.
I like I watch in that hour,

1892
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:31,960
I don't know Sebastian or all but 
watching him for that hour,

1893
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:35,020
this is like a year ago was the most I 
learned in comedy and a really,

1894
01:25:35,021 --> 01:25:35,854
really long time.
He's so physical and like what he does 

1895
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:40,660
with his body and his eyes,
like he's making eye contact with almost

1896
01:25:40,661 --> 01:25:42,880
everybody in the audience.
And I was like,

1897
01:25:42,881 --> 01:25:45,340
Holy Shit Dude.
And he's got to really use that space.

1898
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,650
And I feel like in New York,
if anybody was at physical,

1899
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:49,330
people will be like,
what's this guy fucking dylan?

1900
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,060
Colin Quinn was saying this at,
um,

1901
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:56,920

second,
presale.

1933
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,860
Oh Shit.
Let me do one guys.

1934
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:10,694
We got to end the war in Yemen.
They're going to do libertas coach 

1935
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:17,030
special called Libertas.
Go check it out.

1936
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:18,200
It was so incredible.
Guys.

1937
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:20,390
Joe Rogan specifically said himself that
it's his favorite comedy,

1938
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:22,640
especially he's ever seen off air.
He said that.

1939
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,410
Don't mention it again when he comes 
back in the room,

1940
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:26,150
but I'm pretty sure he said that.
Tweet that Adam.

1941
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,073
I'm almost certain that's what he said.
I said that he gave me a look that kind 

1942
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:33,560
of said that in the look,
but he never actually verbalized no,

1943
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:34,394
but really go by days comedy,
special libertas available right 

1944
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:38,330
now@gasdigitalnetwork.com.

1945
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,860
We're not plugging everything in our 
lives right now.

1946
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,270
Don't worry.
Hey,

1947
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:45,010
what's up the bears man.
Bears are crazy.

1948
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:48,950
I drank way too much water today.
Quite an issue.

1949
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:51,410
Water is so hard for me to drink.
It's so boring.

1950
01:27:51,411 --> 01:27:53,270
I fucking hate it.
It is boring,

1951
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:56,510
but it's not boring.
If you were fucking dying of thirst,

1952
01:27:56,830 --> 01:28:00,410
you gotta think if you were in a desert 
and you just like barely hanging on,

1953
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,244
your lips are cracked and bleeding and 
your skin is sore with sun blisters all 

1954
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:10,430
over it and just wandering and you just 
see a fucking one of those,

1955
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:11,264
uh,
Fiji water's in a bucket of ice for 

1956
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,314
those giant ones was the nicest one.
Big Ones brought a crystal light packet 

1957
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,950
shut.
Shut splenda.

1958
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:28,930
I got some emergency scorebig.
Casad gotta.

1959
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,513
Keep Koolaid in my.
Go back to what I had like a couple of 

1960
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:38,720
weeks ago for the first time and fucking
20 years or some shit.

1961
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:40,940
When was the last time I had koolaid 
before that,

1962
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,980
but I was at a barbecue place and it was
so good.

1963
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:44,053
I had to go with the Koolaid was fuck.
It was sort of racist for a drink to 

1964
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,570
offer at a barbecue place?
No,

1965
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,220
it was a black owned business.
Yeah.

1966
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,363
Yeah,
they.

1967
01:28:53,850 --> 01:28:56,750
They were doing.
They were serious about it.

1968
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:57,584
It was in Fresno and then you've got to 
be careful because you want to see on 

1969
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:02,030
the menu you go to.
You guys have coined music.

1970
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,850
Yeah.
It was like the first drink.

1971
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:06,590
It's like,
yeah,

1972
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:09,750
the all that other bullshit like Pepsi 
root beer if you're really interested,

1973
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,480
but she want Koolaid.
You'd want to do this shit right.

1974
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:13,403
You can eat oxtails might as wives or 
Koolaid has ever Koolaid guy and I was 

1975
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,660
poor.
We were always like a shitty ice tea,

1976
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:22,680
like scoopable sugary ice tea into the.
I remember that Shit.

1977
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,543
We used to do a lot of that in my home.
The lemonade and the ice to realize 

1978
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,900
flavored makes no sense to me.
Yeah.

1979
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:32,190
See,
I don't even know what that makes.

1980
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:38,550
T just cold water garbage in this tea.
Iced tea.

1981
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,810
I drink unsweetened iced tea all the 
time.

1982
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,420
I hate it.
It's like vegetable water,

1983
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:47,790
some phytonutrients in it.
Apparently.

1984
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,140
I'd rather drink water.
Yeah,

1985
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,063
the water is good man.
Maybe just drink a little sparkling 

1986
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:53,820
water.

1987
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:57,120
Mix it up and get a little fucking 
Pellegrino in your system.

1988
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:02,870
We have the sets of fucks you up.
You know,

1989
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:07,020
just water or whiskey either.
What's a cheat day?

1990
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,500
I'm telling you right now in the best 
shape I was ever in my entire life.

1991
01:30:10,501 --> 01:30:11,334
Dude.
I was drinking diet coke like a 

1992
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:12,790
motherfucker,
right?

1993
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,643
ABS.
And I'm sure my body on the inside is a 

1994
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:17,880
Goddamn nightmare.
Um,

1995
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:21,060
but I was drinking like an insane amount
of diet soda.

1996
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:22,620
It was a problem.
Really.

1997
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,550
That was how hydrate they say that Shit 
fucks you up in so many different ways.

1998
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:29,100
And one of the ways does the,
all those chemicals,

1999
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,440
they're fucking terrible for your gut 
flora.

2000
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:35,070
Like even sugar's bad for your gut flora
if you drink regular coke,

2001
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,610
but apparently if you drink diet coke.
My Gut Flora is pretty dope though.

2002
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,310
So you say so you don't know anything 
about my gut flora Joe Rogan.

2003
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:44,453
I'm always suspicious of people were 
bragging about their right and I bet my 

2004
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:54,010
uncle is a straight up psychic bro.
I'm telling her mind reader,

2005
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,133
you don't have any secrets from him Bro.
He looks into your eyes and she's 

2006
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,593
window.

2007
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:03,113
Yeah.
He's got a neon sign in front of his 

2008
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:04,854
house and everything.
It's always the guy who's bragging the 

2009
01:31:07,081 --> 01:31:11,850
most.
Got Some farty gas gut flora.

2010
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:14,640
What the fuck is Gut Flora?
You don't know what that is for real.

2011
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,990
Are you kidding?
Yeah.

2012
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,490
Gut Flora.
Your um,

2013
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:23,860
your stomach has living organisms.
I'm sorry.

2014
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:25,570
Don't act like you guys fucking.
No.

2015
01:31:25,571 --> 01:31:28,020
A Gut Flora was sure he knows I was 
going to explain it,

2016
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:31,950
but joe got it.
Oh,

2017
01:31:32,330 --> 01:31:33,163
joe do it.
It's a show that please check the 

2018
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:39,140
lighting.
It's the Flores Flores.

2019
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:41,300
Am I pronouncing it right?
But pronounced.

2020
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,143
It might be your actual life forms.
There's more eco lie in your gut than 

2021
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:47,850
they've ever been.
People ever.

2022
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,640
That's fact.
Your Gut,

2023
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:54,110
your gut sign.
We are.

2024
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:56,790
We are.
We're a ecosystem.

2025
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,070
Every human being is an ecosystem.
We're not a one thing.

2026
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,680
You cannot exist without the bacteria in
your system,

2027
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:03,723
without what's on your skin,
protecting you from other invading 

2028
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:06,820
bacteria.

2029
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:11,150
We're in a sea of life forms that are 
floating through the air and we ca.

2030
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:12,003
That's why you get sick.
If you touch things and you touch your 

2031
01:32:13,541 --> 01:32:14,374
face,
you're literally taking life forms in 

2032
01:32:15,741 --> 01:32:17,800
your body that wants to go to war with 
your immune system.

2033
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:20,020
Somewhere like deep there when you're 
getting just like a rash,

2034
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:22,540
there's just like some dude arguing with
his check or it was like,

2035
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,820
get off my back.
All right.

2036
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:26,770
And leaving and the rash,
that's what it is.

2037
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:29,980
They had a fucking gang fight in the 
middle of your face and became a Zit.

2038
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,410
That's where cancer.
I've said this for the longest time.

2039
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:33,244
That's where cancer comes from.
You put shit in your body that's not 

2040
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:36,310
supposed to be there.
And when they,

2041
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:37,090
uh,
what's his name?

2042
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:39,710
Said he got mouth cancer for being now.
Catherine said,

2043
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:40,871
yeah,
dude,

2044
01:32:40,871 --> 01:32:41,110
I'm talking.

2045
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:42,820
We're not.
We're not supposed to get it from her.

2046
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:44,500
Well,
he said that he got it from eating a lot

2047
01:32:44,501 --> 01:32:45,191
of.
First of all,

2048
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:46,024
he said he didn't really say that and 
that people have distorted what he 

2049
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:49,670
originally said.
Well,

2050
01:32:49,671 --> 01:32:53,070
because he was talking like this,
it would be like the first guy ever.

2051
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:53,913
Imagine if it was Michael Douglas was 
the first guy ever to get mouth cancer 

2052
01:32:56,741 --> 01:32:57,670
from eating pussy.
Be like,

2053
01:32:57,671 --> 01:32:58,960
whoa.
I think that's a real thing,

2054
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,003
but it's the best.
It's the best reason to give for having 

2055
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:02,950
mouth cancer.
Like how'd you get that mouth?

2056
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:03,784
Camels.
Bad Ass was eating tons of lack a 

2057
01:33:08,031 --> 01:33:08,864
motherfucker.
Remember that trap and trailer has 

2058
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:12,780
sucked it right out of that square to 
cancer.

2059
01:33:12,781 --> 01:33:16,660
All over my face,
hot and in the mouth like right down the

2060
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:21,661
hatch,
a carnival clown mouth or once every six

2061
01:33:22,301 --> 01:33:23,860
weeks ago.
Grind off what's in there.

2062
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:27,100
Go ahead.
Getting back to work in the morning,

2063
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:33,450
Sammy Down Lyoto came gargle to smooth 
that bitch down.

2064
01:33:35,930 --> 01:33:38,380
Always play.
Give me a cortisone shot in this thing.

2065
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,140
I got an 11 at home,
crawling off the walls.

2066
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,750
This bitch is crazy and she's hot as the
sun,

2067
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:48,580
so I'm going back to work once that 
pussy sucked.

2068
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:55,030
Your doctor wants to know because 
without warning,

2069
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:59,950
wanting to get too specific,
this particular cancers caused by HPV,

2070
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:04,060
which actually comes from cunnilingus 
amongst other things,

2071
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,920
but he took it back,
so don't worry if stress caused my son's

2072
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:10,060
income.
Oh,

2073
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:14,050
stress caused by my son's incarceration.
Didn't help trigger it.

2074
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,030
But yeah,
it's a sexually transmitted disease.

2075
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:18,330
It causes cancer.
Interesting.

2076
01:34:18,331 --> 01:34:18,971
I'm telling you,
dude,

2077
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:20,900
HP,
you're not supposed to put our dicks and

2078
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,000
are and shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

2079
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:27,580
Fun.
Killer platform.

2080
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,660
Get every time.
I'm 60,

2081
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,620
90 with my check.
I'm like,

2082
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,990
we're just given each other kids right 
now and it makes me a little bit harder.

2083
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:33,823
If you didn't,
you have like a cancer doctor has to 

2084
01:34:34,910 --> 01:34:36,730
charge you like smoking cigarettes and 
be like,

2085
01:34:36,731 --> 01:34:38,290
Louis,
if you're going to keep eating pussy,

2086
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:39,124
I can't see you anymore.
That's probably exactly what it's going 

2087
01:34:40,801 --> 01:34:41,634
to be.
One day I just picked kiss their clit 

2088
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:45,190
the whole time.
That's a good move.

2089
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,620
See,
the thing is now they have a vaccine,

2090
01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:50,410
so now you get that hpv vaccine you 
never have to worry about.

2091
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:51,190
You have to go.
Yeah,

2092
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:52,750
so they're giving it to young.
Yup.

2093
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,640
Good dudes and girls.
Oh Man,

2094
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:57,640
it's a vaccine,
but it come a risky one.

2095
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,040
It's

2096
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,820
like there's some side effects and some 
people had,

2097
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,480
you know,
depending on your biology.

2098
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:04,310
Some people are pretty extreme side 
effects apparently.

2099
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,590
Like people who have gotten really sick 
from that.

2100
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:10,640
A HPV vaccine that happens with almost 
all the vaccines.

2101
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:12,380
Those certain people get really sick 
them.

2102
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:13,223
Yeah.
I mean this is the problem with this 

2103
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:16,370
whole anti vaccine movement is like 
they're not.

2104
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:17,293
They don't understand the nuanced 
details of what it means to take an 

2105
01:35:22,461 --> 01:35:23,294
entire population of 300 million people 
and try to figure out a vaccine that's 

2106
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:32,150
going to protect them from disease.
It's not going to work on everybody.

2107
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:34,040
There's going to be people that don't 
jive with it.

2108
01:35:34,041 --> 01:35:34,874
There's going to be people that are 
allergic to some of the stuff that's in 

2109
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:39,680
it is going to be people that have weird
biological reactions.

2110
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:44,180
These are the outliers and like you have
to be willing to accept a certain amount

2111
01:35:44,181 --> 01:35:44,810
of outliers.

2112
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:47,570
Unfortunately,
if you want to protect people from polio

2113
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:51,260
and and all these different fucking 
crazy diseases that they've really got a

2114
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:54,140
good grip on measles.
Up until recently measles,

2115
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:56,360
they had it locked down.
Nobody was getting measles anymore,

2116
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,343
but all these fucking hippies decided 
not to vaccinate their kids and now 

2117
01:35:59,970 --> 01:36:02,270
measles are coming back because they're 
worried about autism,

2118
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,060
but at the same time dads are getting 
older and older.

2119
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:08,300
These 54 year old dudes are having 
babies and you're like,

2120
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:09,770
hey man,
like this.

2121
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:10,613
This is.
This is way more of your problem than 

2122
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,513
probably most vaccinations.
As soon as we statistically old sperm 

2123
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,320
mix,
kids will left hands but to vaccinations

2124
01:36:21,321 --> 01:36:24,230
have fuck people up to.
It's like both things are true.

2125
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,990
Like vaccinations are very important 
numbers though.

2126
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,060
Take.
You have to look at it and go,

2127
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:30,060
all right dude.
You know,

2128
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,243
but there's also been like,
I mean there's been a real extensive 

2129
01:36:32,961 --> 01:36:33,794
research to disprove the idea that the 
vaccinations are the reason for the 

2130
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:37,873
autism,
but I can understand it just like a 

2131
01:36:39,621 --> 01:36:42,380
human instinctual way.
Imagine you have a baby,

2132
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:43,423
you get your baby vaccinated.
There's nothing goes more against your 

2133
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:46,664
instincts than to give your baby to a 
stranger and let them prick you with 

2134
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:51,563
like everything in you is telling you 
this is a bad idea and then your kid's 

2135
01:36:54,201 --> 01:36:56,600
sick over the next year.
I think it's very easy.

2136
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:59,000
Just psychologically it'd be like,
well that's what fucking happened.

2137
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:01,020
When I gave him to that guy and he 
fucking prick them.

2138
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:01,893
That's the reason my son isn't 
circumcised was because he was born at 

2139
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,180
three in the morning and they were going
to do it the next day.

2140
01:37:06,810 --> 01:37:09,180
And when I brought,
I had held him and I loved them.

2141
01:37:09,181 --> 01:37:10,900
I looked at him in the face if they were
going to do it right away,

2142
01:37:10,901 --> 01:37:11,671
I like take them.
I cut them.

2143
01:37:11,671 --> 01:37:12,580
I don't give a fuck.
I don't want that.

2144
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:14,553
But now he hit anyway.
Squeezed at the beginning to have the 

2145
01:37:23,821 --> 01:37:28,410
kids had a look at the top of squeezy 
pussy.

2146
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,720
All you want to do with that pussy 
squeeze,

2147
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:33,720
squeeze,
squeeze my son's fucking head.

2148
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:36,990
You can't help it.
You gotta squeeze it tight.

2149
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,160
Fucking ramp head hanging out.
They came back the next day.

2150
01:37:41,161 --> 01:37:42,360
They're like,
are we going to take them now?

2151
01:37:42,361 --> 01:37:45,180
And I mean I,
I mean I had fucking hung out with him.

2152
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:48,030
He's my son.
I loved him at that point so much.

2153
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:52,130
So take me to a strip club already.
Chicken also implanted in my mind all of

2154
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:55,980
these babies circumcision videos where 
she made me watch and it's a thing dude.

2155
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,200
Yeah.
And it's terrible.

2156
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:58,833
It's a barbaric practice that people 
only do because it was done to them and 

2157
01:38:01,711 --> 01:38:03,900
because we feel like it's part of 
tradition and I agree.

2158
01:38:04,050 --> 01:38:04,883
They have these bullshit stories.
Bell or goal hope or are you trying to 

2159
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:08,783
shut up?
You're not getting HIV that they did 

2160
01:38:11,751 --> 01:38:12,584
that.
They did a study in Africa where they 

2161
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:14,304
took like a few hundred people in a 
fucking straight up a place in Africa 

2162
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:18,054
where it was like one out of every four 
people had aids and they proved that 

2163
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:23,760
circumcising them was stopping the 
transmission of aids because there's not

2164
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:24,594
as many breaks in the for skin,
so it's not as easy to transmit the 

2165
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:27,504
disease.
But we were talking about a third world 

2166
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:30,210
country where they're cleaning their 
bodies.

2167
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:33,990
We don't live in that same type of 
poverty or fucked up like disease.

2168
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:37,140
If you look at any of the justifications
for circumcision,

2169
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:40,340
they're all super weak.
None of them actually,

2170
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,333
you know,
they'll say these things where it's 

2171
01:38:41,401 --> 01:38:41,791
like,
well,

2172
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,370
you can't get cancer in,
in your for skin or something like that.

2173
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:45,150
And you're like,
yeah,

2174
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:47,550
and if you just lopped off chicks 
breasts,

2175
01:38:47,551 --> 01:38:48,384
they can't get breast cancer,
but we're still not going to just 

2176
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:50,633
preemptively be like,
let's just fucking start castrating 

2177
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:58,200
people.
It changes the sensitivity of your Dick.

2178
01:38:58,201 --> 01:38:59,970
Uh,
Dick supposed to be slippery at the top.

2179
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,770
I mean,
while you pull that for skin away,

2180
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,960
it just dries up like an old piece of 
gum.

2181
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,393
Not supposed to be like that.
We've lived with literally change with 

2182
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:11,670
Dick's feel like when they go into 
people's bodies,

2183
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:12,533
it is gross.
When you describe an uncircumcised Dick 

2184
01:39:14,221 --> 01:39:15,054
is self-lubricating you.
That's how they got the business done 

2185
01:39:18,571 --> 01:39:19,950
back in the day.
It is a,

2186
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:24,090
but that's the way my Dick Hangs soft.
I could.

2187
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:27,990
I would hate having for skin.
You'd get over it.

2188
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,400
Just that.
Would you rather that or no deck that or

2189
01:39:31,401 --> 01:39:33,800
no deck for a new force come back or.
No.

2190
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:34,621
Oh,
of course.

2191
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:38,840
Yeah,
so just let it go too.

2192
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,510
Extreme ends of the rainbow.
That's how I live.

2193
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,803
If I take it back,
I don't know if I can go back now and 

2194
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:46,350
just write what.
I just take my.

2195
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:47,720
If a genie came out,
the gas.

2196
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:49,120
Jeanie,
Eric came in and said,

2197
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:54,520
we're gonna have one wish and it's just 
about your pretty specific wishes back.

2198
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:56,243
Let's see what's up.
You're going to get cut again if you're 

2199
01:39:57,911 --> 01:39:58,744
a crazy asshole or they also to do it in
less than it would be your decision 

2200
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,350
reconstructive surgery they have for it 
to pull shit.

2201
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:05,570
I've seen what they do.
They take clothes,

2202
01:40:05,571 --> 01:40:09,050
pins,
they pull your dick apart down,

2203
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:13,390
stretch the skin out around your Dick,
and it becomes kinda like a forest.

2204
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:17,310
Like instead of like being one piece of 
meat,

2205
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:18,144
it's like a double piece in a rolled up.
Like ghostface killer webster was 

2206
01:40:23,731 --> 01:40:25,620
hanging in his closet to try to make 
himself taller.

2207
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:26,803
All the grocer shit about four skin is 
accentuated by the fact that it's a 

2208
01:40:30,241 --> 01:40:31,074
double.
It's essentially like the whole skin of 

2209
01:40:33,781 --> 01:40:35,820
the deck has to go over the top of the 
deck.

2210
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,780
It's outrageous.
They did it.

2211
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,690
They did a penn and teller bullshit 
about that.

2212
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,580
Oh,
that's easy.

2213
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:42,623
They're so into it,
but here's the thing we should do and 

2214
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:47,610
congratulations to you for doing that.
Don't circumcise your kids anymore.

2215
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:48,980
It's crazy.
Got To stop.

2216
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:51,270
That's really weird and fucked up.
It's dangerous.

2217
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,980
It's not 100 percent dangerous,
but it might

2218
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,813
be one out of a thousand kids.
Get some sort of an infection and they 

2219
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:58,660
could lose their dick that happens to 
you,

2220
01:40:58,670 --> 01:40:59,503
and then they do a session that's a 
regular thing that happens when it 

2221
01:41:04,331 --> 01:41:06,430
happens.
They fuck up their dicks circumcision,

2222
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:08,020
they get the infection and then they 
say,

2223
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:08,854
all right,
well now you can have a baby with no 

2224
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:13,150
dick and have it be a boy or we can 
sexual sexual reassignment to be a girl.

2225
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:17,110
And kids find out years later that they 
were born a boy.

2226
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:19,570
And that's why that happened.
There's actually a famous case,

2227
01:41:19,571 --> 01:41:22,600
there's a famous case about that where 
they did a botched circumcision.

2228
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,953
The kids penis was removed and then they
decided to give him a sexual 

2229
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:29,530
reassignment and everyone was fucking 
terrified of it.

2230
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:31,720
It didn't work.
The kid became massively,

2231
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:34,540
massively depressed and then wound up 
committing suicide,

2232
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:39,100
uh,
as an adult and just just felt robbed of

2233
01:41:39,101 --> 01:41:39,910
reality.

2234
01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:41,320
You know,
by what,

2235
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:43,090
by some crazy,
stupid,

2236
01:41:43,091 --> 01:41:43,924
avoidable ritual.
Are you going to cut baby dicks because 

2237
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,030
you think it looks better.
And,

2238
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:51,190
and in the best case scenario,
even when all that shit doesn't happen,

2239
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:53,230
you're torturing a baby.
I mean,

2240
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:55,670
how else could you describe using 
Novacane?

2241
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:59,350
We're not saying like you're not,
but if anyone,

2242
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:01,030
if you ever had a surgery like that and 
they were like,

2243
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:02,140
oh,
we're just going to put some local.

2244
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:05,260
I mean like no one does gang.
So bad.

2245
01:42:05,410 --> 01:42:07,390
You're so sensitive.
You don't even know what pain is.

2246
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,080
Your little tiny one dale person when 
someone's cutting your dick already,

2247
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:16,000
like what kind of a world of I've been 
fucking does to you in that moment where

2248
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:16,834
you're like,
we don't know the type of psychological 

2249
01:42:18,311 --> 01:42:21,770
damage that that causes in that moment.
There's a real intense pain there in the

2250
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:22,000
world.

2251
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,833
They want their mom.
They want to be held against her mom's 

2252
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:25,060
breast.
They want to be feeding with their mom.

2253
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:25,894
They want the love right now.
That's what they're supposed to get and 

2254
01:42:27,601 --> 01:42:30,460
you take them and you fucking mutilate 
them.

2255
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:31,623
Who knows what type of switch you turn 
on in that fucking babies had in that 

2256
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:35,524
moment.
Yeah.

2257
01:42:35,530 --> 01:42:39,250
You make Jewish people start all the 
wars.

2258
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,193
They decided they decided to fucking 
really good at finance and the diamond 

2259
01:42:43,421 --> 01:42:48,421
business and they were like one of the 
first people to be circumcised.

2260
01:42:49,831 --> 01:42:53,110
Like the Jewish people you always assume
were circumcised.

2261
01:42:53,111 --> 01:42:54,670
Right?
Why is that?

2262
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,560
It's just part of the code,
but there's no.

2263
01:42:57,790 --> 01:42:58,623
No one really knows.
Any reason where I was trying to save a 

2264
01:42:59,531 --> 01:43:01,570
little,
you know,

2265
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:04,663
is the most horrific you ever watched 
the circumcision rituals they do in 

2266
01:43:07,241 --> 01:43:08,130
Africa.
It.

2267
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:09,580
I've seen a few of them.
Oh my God,

2268
01:43:09,581 --> 01:43:11,440
there's a video of this dude just 
standing there,

2269
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:13,060
standing there,
balls ass naked,

2270
01:43:13,210 --> 01:43:15,280
and the guy comes over,
grabs his dick,

2271
01:43:15,281 --> 01:43:18,470
grabs this with one swipe of the blade,
shoot,

2272
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,713
takes off the forest,
can pulls on his dick and slices away 

2273
01:43:22,121 --> 01:43:24,850
and yanks it off and the guy stands 
there completely.

2274
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:25,683
Stone face doesn't react,
and that's part of the ritual is Dana 

2275
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,460
White Wilson.
So you want to be an ultimate fighter.

2276
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:33,970
His Dick is bleeding and he's just 
standing there.

2277
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:36,730
He's not looking at it and it's not a 
good circumcision cut either.

2278
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:39,130
It's totally fuck.
It's like peeling an orange,

2279
01:43:39,430 --> 01:43:40,263
right?
You're never going to get a straight 

2280
01:43:40,571 --> 01:43:45,571
line.
It's really lit and looks like this poor

2281
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:46,560
guy's Dick.
It's,

2282
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:48,640
it's.
So if you see the Jamie,

2283
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:52,000
do you know the video saved on my

2284
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,913
fingers,
the Jewish ceremony where the rabbi 

2285
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,270
isn't the right by like suck blood or 
something.

2286
01:43:57,271 --> 01:43:58,430
That's a dick.
Yeah,

2287
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:00,710
like every.
It's not that every Jew doesn't do that,

2288
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:05,380
but there's Dick sucked by a rabbi.
Yeah.

2289
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:07,290
I might've.
Have you done any babysitter,

2290
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,030
Dick Sucking cock.
I brought this up three years ago

2291
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:14,860
on the show and I'm the only person 
doing any research on our show.

2292
01:44:14,861 --> 01:44:15,694
I may seem like I'm the dumbest one,
but I promise you right now you're 

2293
01:44:17,441 --> 01:44:18,740
almost prepared.
Dumbest one.

2294
01:44:18,770 --> 01:44:21,010
I'm the one doing the research.
I brought this up and everyone looked at

2295
01:44:21,011 --> 01:44:21,940
me like I'm an asshole.
And I'm like,

2296
01:44:21,941 --> 01:44:22,601
no,
I swear to God.

2297
01:44:22,601 --> 01:44:25,480
Rabbis are out there sucking babies.
Dicks and you guys were your

2298
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,380
videos.
Are you justifying it?

2299
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,710
You gave a headline thing because they 
had to.

2300
01:44:30,980 --> 01:44:33,890
There was some serious problems with it.
Oddly enough,

2301
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:34,753
because of herpes,
because babies were getting herpes and 

2302
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:40,130
dying from herpes,
from rabbi sucking their Dick after they

2303
01:44:40,131 --> 01:44:40,964
performed this circumcision and 
apparently in some versions of Judaism 

2304
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:46,043
it's part of the ritual and that this 
guy was explaining it and like in 

2305
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:50,533
Yiddish and he was explaining all the 
different things that what's important 

2306
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:57,470
that the rabbi or the WHO have the mo l 
performs this.

2307
01:44:57,680 --> 01:45:00,650
I think he said it to tsetse.
He had like a word for it.

2308
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,700
Oh,
you mean the bulls?

2309
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:04,940
He says a nice old word for sucking baby
dicks.

2310
01:45:04,941 --> 01:45:06,690
You just cut.
I mean it's,

2311
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:11,830
it's so the only in religion.
Do you have a youtube video where you're

2312
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:15,270
dressed like a wizard talking about 
sucking baby dixit.

2313
01:45:15,271 --> 01:45:15,950
You just cut and.

2314
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:16,783
Well this is a part of our tradition,
but do you think it's an argument like 

2315
01:45:19,661 --> 01:45:24,350
you're not just some fucking like dress 
and like making like singing some song.

2316
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:25,990
You're actually going like,
well this is what I have to.

2317
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,970
Have you seen it?
Do you think it's definitely sinister?

2318
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,700
No,
it's retarded always.

2319
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:31,543
Or is it just like it's fucking stupid.
They're stuck in it and someone did it 

2320
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:35,324
to him and someone did it to his dad and
they feel like they're a part of this 

2321
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:39,080
clan.
It's fucking.

2322
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:40,940
And you feel like if you were to give up
on that,

2323
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:42,920
you're giving up on your dad,
your family.

2324
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:43,763
Everything's alive,
so you got to just blindly believe that 

2325
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:49,070
this is what you did to retard the 
progress.

2326
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,290
It retards progress.
It is.

2327
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:53,330
It literally is retarded.
Like in that sense,

2328
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:56,060
like forget about the derogatory term 
you used for people.

2329
01:45:56,450 --> 01:45:59,930
It's a retarded idea.
It retards logic.

2330
01:46:00,170 --> 01:46:03,650
You're cutting a baby dick and sucking 
on it.

2331
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:05,960
Then you're making a youtube video 
saying,

2332
01:46:05,961 --> 01:46:07,760
well,
but when we thought the world was flat,

2333
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:08,623
this is how we do.
We still do it this way and we like to 

2334
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:13,790
cut it and we like to fuck when we have 
a name for it.

2335
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:17,420
It's not that I make with my mouth 
that's different than sucking cut baby.

2336
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:22,940
I've judged is very important.
A rose by any other name I say.

2337
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:26,053
Yeah,
I mean it was crazy that someone could 

2338
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:31,130
sit around and justify doing some shit 
to a baby's deck.

2339
01:46:31,131 --> 01:46:31,964
Just because they've always done it,
but I think all but two have Jackie 

2340
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:39,610
Mason to it,
like a reasonable rate.

2341
01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:41,503
Just a little bit.
I mean is if it's any better to cut it 

2342
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:44,744
and not suck it,
like at least maybe it feels better for 

2343
01:46:46,431 --> 01:46:47,580
the kid to.
Honestly,

2344
01:46:47,590 --> 01:46:49,590
if you're going to stick,
give a blowjob

2345
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,083
standpoint.
You would definitely want somebody to 

2346
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:53,730
suck your Dick after you got to cut.
But how,

2347
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:56,850
what kind of a person just sucks baby 
dicks all the time.

2348
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:59,370
Like how many baby you took an average 
rabbi.

2349
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:04,080
There's done this or what it was it a 
moral moral oil more was my.

2350
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:04,914
Well,
so like a shoe company or something 

2351
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:06,933
that's close to whale,
but these how many baby dicks in a 

2352
01:47:09,961 --> 01:47:10,794
lifetime and a strong career?
Thirty five year career working for the 

2353
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:13,974
synagogue.
How many baby dicks have you started 

2354
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:15,834
going to college and have numbers?
Imagine that you go to college in 

2355
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:19,750
Arizona.
Is that matter?

2356
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:21,650
She's got license,
particularly sledding.

2357
01:47:22,270 --> 01:47:25,370
Could you imagine if she testifies like 
a Nazi and Nuremberg goes.

2358
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:26,243
I was following orders.
I had to was a website and you just see 

2359
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:32,700
like it just scrolled and you know that 
bar on the right side.

2360
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:36,380
The dot was really tiny.
A lot to do.

2361
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:39,240
It's all the baby dixie sucked over the 
years.

2362
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:44,130
I kept an elbow,
but he told me it was the best chicken,

2363
01:47:44,170 --> 01:47:45,590
my page,
my.

2364
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:46,463
Anyway,
so Jamie do not show us that son of a 

2365
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:53,340
bitch.
Her check.

2366
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,400
How's that online?
Is that on youtube and it's.

2367
01:47:57,420 --> 01:47:59,520
There's blood everywhere.
There's a cut it.

2368
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,490
There's blood everywhere and the baby's 
screaming and the guy sucks.

2369
01:48:02,491 --> 01:48:04,440
The baby's Dick.
Congratulations.

2370
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,573
You're an idiot.

2371
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:11,580
Sorry for cutting your Dick though.
This is one of those things that because

2372
01:48:11,581 --> 01:48:14,640
it's a part of a religion,
people get mad if you take it down.

2373
01:48:14,850 --> 01:48:16,570
People get mad if you shit on it,
but you.

2374
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:19,020
This is one of the.
If you see,

2375
01:48:19,150 --> 01:48:19,983
there's no clear indication that your 
religion is gone completely off the 

2376
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:24,260
track.
That if you're cutting baby dixon,

2377
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:25,103
then sucking them.
Anybody in their right mind outside of 

2378
01:48:27,661 --> 01:48:29,400
that religion saying we can do to 
Charlie.

2379
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,640
Thinking about cutting David Dixon,
sucking him.

2380
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:34,770
What's it called?
The MTI and the CIA.

2381
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:36,090
Yeah.
Here's what's fucked up.

2382
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:37,650
That's on youtube.
Look,

2383
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:38,603
yeah,
there's a lot of Jewish people that are 

2384
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:39,954
watching their families,
babies getting their dicks cut and then 

2385
01:48:41,581 --> 01:48:42,414
such,
but then there's also a whole set of 

2386
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:45,263
pedophile vampires that are watching 
that and just beating off to it all day 

2387
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:49,463
long.
Some fucking guy who taught his dog to 

2388
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:53,550
Heil Hitler and he's looking at jail 
time.

2389
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:56,220
But you could suck a baby's Dick on 
youtube.

2390
01:48:56,221 --> 01:48:57,930
It's your fucking video.
Go Up.

2391
01:48:58,020 --> 01:48:59,670
Yes.
You want to stop baby dicks,

2392
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:01,420
but I want to go to jail.
Oh,

2393
01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:06,610
become a rabbi Jamie.
Get that down.

2394
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:10,680
Show you.
There's a bunch of son of a bitch.

2395
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:13,880
There's hundreds of them.
Hundreds of guys suck.

2396
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:18,881
And Baby Dick's when it's 2018.
This is not a Jewish religion.

2397
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:22,763
We're not living in the barbarian times,
but today people are cutting in sucking 

2398
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,473
baby dick.
How about genital female genital 

2399
01:49:29,071 --> 01:49:34,071
mutilation for it?
How much act for two.

2400
01:49:34,270 --> 01:49:35,880
Please say that anymore,
man.

2401
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:38,160
Yes,
you can march.

2402
01:49:38,190 --> 01:49:39,240
It's march.
I'll wait.

2403
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:41,610
Oh,
it's a female as of April.

2404
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:42,444
It's off and mutilation month.
What month is it a female empowerment 

2405
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:48,730
month?
What is it?

2406
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:50,650
Is it.
Is there one of those nights of Hispanic

2407
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:52,480
month,
Hispanic heritage month.

2408
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,940
There was a.
There was a national woman's Day.

2409
01:49:54,941 --> 01:49:55,774
Right.
I stayed off every year and I'm not 

2410
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:59,950
saying Shit,
don't play in traffic.

2411
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,780
I'm definitely not going to say 
anything.

2412
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,490
Just snotty,
you know,

2413
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:07,060
trying to be cute.
You don't need to say anything.

2414
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:09,040
I wouldn't.
Benjamin is handling it for all of us.

2415
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:12,790
Women's history month,
Hispanic Saturday,

2416
01:50:12,791 --> 01:50:14,290
March 30.
First we're celebrating.

2417
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,670
So this is women's history month.

2418
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,300
The fucked up thing is black history 
month.

2419
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:21,080
The shortest month.
Yeah.

2420
01:50:21,081 --> 01:50:23,320
That was definitely some passive 
aggressive racist shit.

2421
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:26,830
Percent hundred percent keep dam an 
extra bone in the wreck.

2422
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:27,673
What makes them history harder?
So like at what point in time is that 

2423
01:50:35,771 --> 01:50:37,490
going to end?
Like how,

2424
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:38,343
how long in the future would it be 
before we didn't have black history 

2425
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:41,763
month.
Like we're not going to have like a 

2426
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,460
Moore's history month for people.
Right?

2427
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:46,553
So you're saying black people are going 
to go extinct at a certain point and we 

2428
01:50:48,341 --> 01:50:49,174
won't have to.
I think all people are going to go 

2429
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:51,184
extinct at a certain point and I pray.
I bet it's probably within a thousand 

2430
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,660
years.
I just don't think so.

2431
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:58,780
I hope you don't feel are months like 
fucking frat parties.

2432
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:02,290
That's true too,
but I just think like what point in time

2433
01:51:02,291 --> 01:51:04,740
we're going to not care.
I mean if you.

2434
01:51:05,110 --> 01:51:05,943
If there's a way like let's just imagine
is it even humanly possible to engineer 

2435
01:51:10,601 --> 01:51:13,180
the education of human beings to the 
point where there's no more.

2436
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:16,450
Racism doesn't exist anymore.
No more sexism,

2437
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:17,483
no more homophobia.
Naturally we were tribes and we 

2438
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,020
gravitate toward people that look like 
us and we're comfortable with.

2439
01:51:23,021 --> 01:51:26,080
I remember in kindergarten shore,
this is 1987,

2440
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:27,753
we were allowed to just choose our 
tables because it didn't make you sit 

2441
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:31,384
where you no assigned seats or whatever 
and I remember all the white kids just 

2442
01:51:34,241 --> 01:51:35,074
sat with the white kids and the black 
kids sit with the black kids and 

2443
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:37,204
Hispanic and says with the Hispanic kids
and I'm half white and I was raised by 

2444
01:51:39,191 --> 01:51:40,024
white people and you see little Puerto 
Rican may just plopped in the middle of 

2445
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:44,280
this white table and all these little 
kids probably like,

2446
01:51:44,281 --> 01:51:45,370
what the fuck is this kid doing here?

2447
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:46,443
But it was very much like everyone's 
segregated racially and it was very 

2448
01:51:49,391 --> 01:51:50,350
natural.
You're a kid.

2449
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,110
I'm talking about as a grown adult who's
already examined the world,

2450
01:51:53,111 --> 01:51:53,944
don't you think it's possible to people 
to get to the point where they don't do 

2451
01:51:55,511 --> 01:51:57,070
that anymore?
I just let it go.

2452
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:57,993
I think individuals can,
but the idea that in terms of large 

2453
01:52:00,401 --> 01:52:01,234
demographic groups,
there won't be any in group preference 

2454
01:52:03,281 --> 01:52:06,370
and there won't be any.
Maybe I'm not closed off to it,

2455
01:52:06,371 --> 01:52:09,280
but it seems like a real tough goal.
I agree with you 100 percent,

2456
01:52:09,281 --> 01:52:10,114
but I'm more,
I'm more leaning towards that now than 

2457
01:52:11,861 --> 01:52:15,160
ever before because of the Internet 
because I think people are accelerating,

2458
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,270
accelerating what they understand about 
what's going on in the world.

2459
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:20,133
It's just,
it's way more deep like for you've 

2460
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:25,390
talked to average 20 year old today and 
they're just way more knowledgeable than

2461
01:52:25,391 --> 01:52:27,520
I was when I was 20,
like stunningly.

2462
01:52:27,521 --> 01:52:29,830
So like even if they believe ridiculous 
shit,

2463
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:30,870
they.
Yeah,

2464
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:31,723
because they have the information.
I mean because it's like if I like it 

2465
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:36,550
for me to have,
I wouldn't know half the shit.

2466
01:52:36,551 --> 01:52:38,140
I know if I grew up,
you know,

2467
01:52:38,141 --> 01:52:38,974
decades before I did,
I wasn't going to go to the library 

2468
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:42,710
every fucking care.
Yeah.

2469
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:44,470
Yeah.
It's like I wasn't going to put that in,

2470
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:46,040
but when it's right in front of you,
it's

2471
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:46,641
like,
all right,

2472
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:49,280
well I guess I can spend two to 5:00
AM,

2473
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:54,200
but I think we're going towards that.
It seems like the sharing of information

2474
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:55,940
is sort of making us move away from 
that.

2475
01:52:55,941 --> 01:53:00,170
It seems like it's making us more 
erratic and more kind of crazy.

2476
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:01,490
You know,
I feel like we don't know how to like,

2477
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:02,663
you know,
people don't know how to quickly share 

2478
01:53:04,431 --> 01:53:07,280
an idea and deal with people reacting to
that idea.

2479
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,490
Um,
as fast as it's happening.

2480
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:11,290
I think it's creating a lot of people 
like that are,

2481
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,380
you know,
we speak of friends who like,

2482
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,593
like this,
owning each other on facebook and 

2483
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:16,520
publicly been like,
fuck you dude,

2484
01:53:16,521 --> 01:53:18,320
if you believe this,
I don't ever want to talk to you again.

2485
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:18,771
You're like,
dude,

2486
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:19,604
Whoa,
where am I supposed to talk about some 

2487
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:22,700
of the Shit I thought whatever happen to
like water cooler conversation.

2488
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:23,533
You weren't supposed to talk about 
politics or religion or any of this 

2489
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:25,664
stuff.
You're kind of supposed to just leave 

2490
01:53:26,671 --> 01:53:27,504
each other's lives and,
and sort of like live with each other 

2491
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:31,220
and,
and,

2492
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:31,851
you know.
Yeah.

2493
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:33,260
Well,
I remember thinking about this when the,

2494
01:53:33,261 --> 01:53:35,300
um,
the thing with a chick filet,

2495
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:37,520
which by the way is delicious,
but uh,

2496
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:38,383
when they,
when they,

2497
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:40,450
yes,
solid my favorite class,

2498
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:43,790
but when they,
when they were like against gay marriage

2499
01:53:43,910 --> 01:53:46,580
and people are like boycotting chick 
filet and you're just kinda like,

2500
01:53:46,581 --> 01:53:46,930
well,
what,

2501
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,620
what is the precedent that you're 
setting here?

2502
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:52,070
Like if I pull up to a gas station and I
go to like a snack,

2503
01:53:52,071 --> 01:53:52,790
do I have to go?
Like,

2504
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:55,250
so where do you stand on the Iraq war?
Where do you stand on?

2505
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:58,830
It isn't the point that we all can kind 
of get along even if we have wild.

2506
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:04,183
Yeah.
But we would like to spend our money 

2507
01:54:05,341 --> 01:54:08,400
wisely knows the ideas that people are 
voting with their dollars.

2508
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:09,360
Right?
I get that.

2509
01:54:09,361 --> 01:54:12,210
But it's almost like now we can have all
that knowledge and,

2510
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:13,053
and like I get your point,
but it can work toward us being 

2511
01:54:14,911 --> 01:54:16,800
inclusive or it can work toward us being
like,

2512
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:17,753
well no,
I'm not gonna fuck with anybody who 

2513
01:54:19,081 --> 01:54:20,210
doesn't meet x,
Y,

2514
01:54:20,211 --> 01:54:23,610
z beliefs going on,
which isn't,

2515
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,140
isn't necessarily great.
No,

2516
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:27,990
because it's like there's something 
beautiful about like,

2517
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:29,800
uh,
the market where like I'm,

2518
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:31,380
I'm a Jew,
but I can like,

2519
01:54:31,470 --> 01:54:32,303
you know,
get a cab in New York from a Muslim and 

2520
01:54:34,381 --> 01:54:34,981
I'm just like,
oh,

2521
01:54:34,981 --> 01:54:37,140
I'm going up here,
and then he drops me off and he's like,

2522
01:54:37,141 --> 01:54:38,130
have a good night.
God bless.

2523
01:54:38,131 --> 01:54:39,000
And I'm like,
thank you.

2524
01:54:39,001 --> 01:54:39,834
And we give each other money.
Happy place is such a melting pot 

2525
01:54:46,681 --> 01:54:48,870
though.
It's so different than la La.

2526
01:54:48,871 --> 01:54:49,704
Everybody's in their own car.
They go to their own building and 

2527
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:52,620
insulated.
In New York,

2528
01:54:52,621 --> 01:54:55,710
you're forced to walk with people,
getting the train with people.

2529
01:54:55,711 --> 01:54:57,980
Everybody's all together.
The subway,

2530
01:54:58,020 --> 01:54:58,853
9:00
AM at

2531
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,373
34th street.
You have a million people in one small 

2532
01:55:02,781 --> 01:55:04,800
area where it's like one person's a 
homeless person.

2533
01:55:04,830 --> 01:55:05,663
Next person is a multimillionaire,
supermodel actor from every different 

2534
01:55:08,211 --> 01:55:10,550
area life and they're all squished 
together in La.

2535
01:55:10,551 --> 01:55:13,040
You got to go to the party to hang out 
with that model or actor to,

2536
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:16,930
to interact with them really in any way.
You don't have a lot of examples outside

2537
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:18,050
of actor and model.

2538
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:24,240
You said that in home construction 
workers?

2539
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,590
Never found like just like a cashier or 
somebody living the dream.

2540
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,560
I feel battles.

2541
01:55:32,680 --> 01:55:33,513
If you guys want to take an uber back,
if you guys are going to stay and hang 

2542
01:55:35,291 --> 01:55:36,124
out and keep.
Sorry I have to go because I have to go 

2543
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:38,620
through bonfire.
I have to go to series six.

2544
01:55:38,621 --> 01:55:40,060
Seven.
What time do you gotta be there?

2545
01:55:40,500 --> 01:55:42,030
Uh,
we have to be there like,

2546
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:43,650
like 2:40.
Oh,

2547
01:55:43,651 --> 01:55:44,130
zero k

2548
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:44,963
dude.
Yeah.

2549
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,953
Yeah.
Okay.

2550
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,340
That's a Dan soder show isn't deep.
Sirius Xm radio program.

2551
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:50,880
Yes.
Yeah.

2552
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:51,790
I love that show.
On the side.

2553
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:52,763
On the satellite radio.
Well we can either keep going for a 

2554
01:55:54,601 --> 01:55:57,960
little bit and talk mad shit about Jay.
Oh,

2555
01:55:57,961 --> 01:55:59,370
I'd love that.
That'd be fun.

2556
01:55:59,380 --> 01:56:01,740
He'll be fine.
Well we can just wrap this up then.

2557
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:04,920
I can keep going on their I podcast.
I got a lot of shit about Jay to talk.

2558
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:10,710
Thanks very much for having this 
facilitating this.

2559
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,290
Absolutely mad you guys have together.
I love you brother.

2560
01:56:13,450 --> 01:56:17,020
So she's been a prick all week.
The door.

2561
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:18,733
That was poor etiquette.
I liked his half hair red better by 

2562
01:56:23,491 --> 01:56:24,324
buddy jamie.
Did you get the release people try and 

2563
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:28,200
make sure I don't have any.
Your car.

2564
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:29,603
That's.
I like how you rocking the old school 

2565
01:56:30,721 --> 01:56:33,710
chain with the keys.
It's not connected to a wallet.

2566
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:36,060
Let it go.
It's not connected to anything.

2567
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,310
It's just a fashion accessory.
I swear to God,

2568
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:39,810
no wallet.
It's got a chain,

2569
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,333
uh,
marches to the beat of his own drum 

2570
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,510
living in Greece movie.

2571
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:50,340
It's fucking dudes that like would wear 
those like 19 fifties type clothes.

2572
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:52,640
Like roll the cuffs up.
Their jeans.

2573
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:55,190
Were those old school shoes?
Yeah.

2574
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:58,830
Sometimes I get a little like,
you just kind of wish you lived one life

2575
01:56:58,831 --> 01:56:59,664
in every generation.
We don't want to just experience that a 

2576
01:57:01,231 --> 01:57:03,290
little bit and know what that's about.
Oh my God,

2577
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,670
it must have been amazing.
Sixties would've been so cool.

2578
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:06,803
Just like when I get like the 
counterculture movement first happened 

2579
01:57:09,971 --> 01:57:14,050
and like music was just awesome and like
the late sixties was like,

2580
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:15,610
that was just like a cool time to be on 
it.

2581
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:16,453
But I have fat thighs so I could never 
wear the pants that were available from 

2582
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:19,800
it at the time.
You could wear them,

2583
01:57:19,801 --> 01:57:20,634
bro.
You just got to get him going to plead 

2584
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,420
it out.
Yeah.

2585
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:28,680
That was tougher to do in the seventies 
and sixties before the Internet.

2586
01:57:28,681 --> 01:57:30,660
You couldn't find your specific.
Very true.

2587
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:34,500
What's up with people that want to go 
back to those arrows so bad.

2588
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:35,334
They get those really bad tattoos.
You know those like Ed Hardy look and 

2589
01:57:39,331 --> 01:57:40,164
tattoos.
Like what the fuck are you drawing on 

2590
01:57:44,851 --> 01:57:49,440
yourself?
It's like some of those are so bad,

2591
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:54,120
but it's like purposely bad artwork.
It's supposed to mimic a time period,

2592
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,220
but it's like your body is not a museum 
though.

2593
01:57:56,450 --> 01:57:57,960
Okay.
If you want to mimic that time period,

2594
01:57:58,090 --> 01:58:02,460
she get a fucking picture from that time
period and put it on the wall.

2595
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:05,520
There's creativity,
pirate ship on your ass.

2596
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:07,393
People know people I've been established
for almost like before any of that time 

2597
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:11,430
period.
Like where it's just like you'll see the

2598
01:58:11,431 --> 01:58:12,264
pictures from the fifties or something 
where it's just like the dudes wore 

2599
01:58:13,951 --> 01:58:15,900
suits.
The girls that these dresses like almost

2600
01:58:15,950 --> 01:58:17,730
like.
I'd like to experience that for a little

2601
01:58:17,731 --> 01:58:19,290
bit.
Just wearing a suit and a top hat,

2602
01:58:19,291 --> 01:58:23,220
flipping a quarter of all my fucking six
foot four and 120 pounds.

2603
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,430
We want to wear a suit to exact 
measurements.

2604
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:30,990
Were watching this Jack Jack Johnson 
fight on on video from like,

2605
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,003
what was it like the early 19 hundreds 
and everyone in the audience had a one 

2606
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:39,810
of those hats.
Those gentlemen hats that they wear.

2607
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:41,970
They all wear the same hat.
Everybody had

2608
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,750
a hat on.
Like every guy,

2609
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,150
every guy in the audience has thousands 
of people.

2610
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:47,840
They all those dress up hats on.
Oh,

2611
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:51,220
Jack Jones has got to find a ground out 
there.

2612
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:54,820
Look at all the hats to the same hat.
I'll tell you right now,

2613
01:58:54,821 --> 01:58:56,770
everybody's got the same hat on even 
today.

2614
01:58:56,771 --> 01:58:59,680
It's like accessorizing for a dude is 
like the best look.

2615
01:58:59,830 --> 01:59:00,663
You throw in like a watch and like a 
nice like hat and like just little 

2616
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:07,750
things they make.
It puts a dude together like a check.

2617
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:09,550
You want his little shit on her 
responsible.

2618
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:11,770
You want it to be as close to naked as 
possible,

2619
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:13,180
but we don't give a shit about 
accessories.

2620
01:59:13,181 --> 01:59:14,230
None of that stuff,
but a woman,

2621
01:59:14,231 --> 01:59:16,240
when they look at us and they see like a
watch to like,

2622
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:17,140
oh,
this guy's got money.

2623
01:59:17,720 --> 01:59:19,080
Louis J dot Gomes.
Lights.

2624
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:22,970
Fucking dudes were a lot of jewelry.
If I'm going to fuck him,

2625
01:59:22,971 --> 01:59:24,840
man.
Accessorize very well.

2626
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:26,830
I have twoish.
Rewatch,

2627
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:32,350
jokey.
Stop when Jay until listed on continuing

2628
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:37,590
to tell the world is on accessorizing.
Nah,

2629
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:40,390
man.
Jay can leave.

2630
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:43,100
We'll keep this magic going.
So what's I say?

2631
01:59:43,660 --> 01:59:44,493
That's a good point.
What is harder than to do with the 

2632
01:59:45,740 --> 01:59:49,450
watch?
You guys get what I'm saying?

2633
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,400
Sure.
Jay Calls me later.

2634
01:59:51,401 --> 01:59:51,761
He's like,
hey,

2635
01:59:51,761 --> 01:59:52,760
how'd the rest of the show go?
Go.

2636
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:57,520
We all just started sucking each others'
time in earrings and shit.

2637
02:00:01,090 --> 02:00:03,670
Scarves and 19 fifties.
Tattoos.

2638
02:00:04,240 --> 02:00:06,670
Roller girls.
Roller Derby girls.

2639
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:08,870
Yeah.
I think people that get those tags,

2640
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:10,150
that style,
like if they go,

2641
02:00:10,151 --> 02:00:11,120
I want to,
uh,

2642
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:12,610
you know,
this old style tattoo,

2643
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:13,553
it's a lack of creativity.
They just want to fit into a certain 

2644
02:00:15,611 --> 02:00:16,444
type of thing.
They want to look like a type of person 

2645
02:00:18,731 --> 02:00:19,564
with that Tattoo.
They saw another dude at one point and 

2646
02:00:20,831 --> 02:00:22,600
they were like,
I want to look like that guy,

2647
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:23,643
and then so it's like you're saying it's
the same thing as the shirts and the 

2648
02:00:26,411 --> 02:00:28,300
hats.
Basically it's the same thing.

2649
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:29,134
It's just trying to look like the next 
guy or just trying to like fit into the 

2650
02:00:31,121 --> 02:00:32,980
fucking thing.
It's like whether it's a suit and a hat,

2651
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:34,240
it's just a fucking,
oh no,

2652
02:00:34,241 --> 02:00:36,100
now I'll get a tattoo.
Now I'll get this.

2653
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,480
And you see that with a lot of people.

2654
02:00:37,590 --> 02:00:38,950
It was a lot of people in la,
in New York,

2655
02:00:38,951 --> 02:00:41,590
you see that a lot where someone's got 
like a crazy different look,

2656
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:42,973
but you're like,
but you were just trying to fit into 

2657
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:44,660
that girl.
Yeah,

2658
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:46,510
but it's all the same thing,
man.

2659
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,850
You're just high school and I was 
nominated.

2660
02:00:48,851 --> 02:00:49,684
We're not goth,
but it was borderline goth in high 

2661
02:00:50,951 --> 02:00:55,951
school can be borderline goth.
It was because there was a goth kids.

2662
02:00:57,841 --> 02:00:59,800
It didn't really accept me.
He's on the spectrum.

2663
02:00:59,801 --> 02:01:04,801
You've got spectrum three five.
That's what I used to wear,

2664
02:01:05,441 --> 02:01:08,440
like Marilyn Manson tee shirts and I had
long hair and eyeliner,

2665
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:09,383
Europe of the world,
but the goth kids weren't really like 

2666
02:01:11,270 --> 02:01:12,970
taken in.
There were those my crew.

2667
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,330
Okay.
Um,

2668
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:15,423
but yeah,
you want it to just be a part of 

2669
02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:19,810
something and everyone was like,
oh that guy so unique or weird,

2670
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:22,900
but I just looked like 100 other kids at
the mall that shop at hot topic.

2671
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:26,500
That's a big problem with young people 
wanting to be a part of something.

2672
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:27,363
You know?
I was listening to Sam Harris podcast 

2673
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:29,404
with Christian ecoline.
He was a white power guy who was 

2674
02:01:32,441 --> 02:01:35,350
recruited into these white nationalist 
when he was like 14.

2675
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:40,100
Just the podcast detailing these 
horrific fucking events that this

2676
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,800
guy went through and horrific violence 
against black people.

2677
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:47,660
He just got sucked into being in a group
when he was 14 and here he is now in his

2678
02:01:47,661 --> 02:01:52,410
40 years after leaving super open and 
honest about it and talking about it,

2679
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:53,273
you're like,
wow.

2680
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,283
And it makes you realize like this smart
guy that you're hearing talking at 40 

2681
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,910
could have been that guy at 14.
They got sucked into the group.

2682
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:02,744
Like it's not.
It isn't really not even whether or not 

2683
02:02:04,911 --> 02:02:05,744
you're smart.
It's whether or not you have life 

2684
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:09,280
experience where you,
you know,

2685
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:10,760
the path you go down.
Because this luck,

2686
02:02:10,761 --> 02:02:11,690
dude,
I'm telling you right now,

2687
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:14,210
you are just a product of your 
environment.

2688
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:17,420
You could turn left when you should've 
turned right one day and then your whole

2689
02:02:17,421 --> 02:02:19,760
fucking life is a whole different thing.
APPS,

2690
02:02:19,761 --> 02:02:20,594
you know,
died some fucked up shit as a teenager 

2691
02:02:21,921 --> 02:02:25,310
that it's like it just,
I happened to land here but I could have

2692
02:02:25,311 --> 02:02:29,270
easily just been in jail or a bit of 
criminal or are legitimately hurt.

2693
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,103
People went down a much different path.
Well that's the crazy thing when people 

2694
02:02:32,370 --> 02:02:33,203
like kind of a like they have so much 
like hatred towards someone else for 

2695
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:36,764
having a different view than them or 
being in a different situation and 

2696
02:02:38,661 --> 02:02:39,041
you're like,
dude,

2697
02:02:39,041 --> 02:02:39,874
just understand.
You were like two little circumstances 

2698
02:02:41,751 --> 02:02:42,584
away from being mad at God.
I see that a lot with people and I'm on 

2699
02:02:45,111 --> 02:02:47,390
the side of like gun rights,
like I'm not for gun,

2700
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:48,433
but the people who are like really 
shitty to these teenage kids who are 

2701
02:02:50,961 --> 02:02:52,820
like becoming famous and you're like,
dude,

2702
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:55,910
if you were a fucking teenager and you 
could have just been on the fucking news

2703
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:58,220
and everyone's praising you because you 
take this position,

2704
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,233
sub,
we'd all fucking do that exact same 

2705
02:03:00,951 --> 02:03:01,784
thing.
Yesterday I was talking about one of 

2706
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:05,060
these nra guys that was mocking these 
kids.

2707
02:03:05,060 --> 02:03:06,110
I'm like,
you're out of your fucking mind.

2708
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:09,260
If anybody should be talking about.
We got to do something.

2709
02:03:09,261 --> 02:03:11,690
It's kids that got shot at.
I mean this is.

2710
02:03:11,691 --> 02:03:13,700
They got.
They have the floor now.

2711
02:03:13,701 --> 02:03:15,440
I understand.
You're supposed to have the floor.

2712
02:03:15,470 --> 02:03:16,303
I mean they just got shot at.
They lost their friends and they are 

2713
02:03:18,531 --> 02:03:21,500
standing up and maybe they're not 
informed about a lot of issues.

2714
02:03:21,501 --> 02:03:24,230
Maybe they don't know what a 
semiautomatic or an ar 15 is.

2715
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:25,064
Maybe they don't know those details,
but they know that no one's doing shit 

2716
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:30,560
and people keep getting shots and the 
kind of biomass because they survived.

2717
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:32,233
They got lucky.
They just fucking one on the right 

2718
02:03:34,521 --> 02:03:35,354
place,
but I was talking about that Maryland 

2719
02:03:37,011 --> 02:03:39,230
one and we like.
You don't talk about the positive ones.

2720
02:03:39,231 --> 02:03:40,140
Yes,
but you know,

2721
02:03:40,141 --> 02:03:42,200
because again,
tell the story.

2722
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:42,920
So more or less.

2723
02:03:42,920 --> 02:03:43,753
In Maryland there was,
there was a school shooting or a kid 

2724
02:03:45,651 --> 02:03:48,050
came into school with a gun,
but they had an armed security guard.

2725
02:03:48,051 --> 02:03:49,340
He took them out.
Nobody died.

2726
02:03:49,370 --> 02:03:50,203
Military Training Guy got rid of him 
quick and that's what the NRA advocates 

2727
02:03:54,771 --> 02:03:56,330
are saying like,
hey,

2728
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:57,830
this is a good thing.
We should.

2729
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:58,693
We should have someone who's an armed 
and ready responder at the school to 

2730
02:04:03,051 --> 02:04:06,500
prevent this kind of shit from happening
and there's a lot of veterans that would

2731
02:04:06,501 --> 02:04:07,334
take that job happily and you would have
your kids 100 percent safe and people 

2732
02:04:11,931 --> 02:04:12,351
are like,
no,

2733
02:04:12,351 --> 02:04:14,540
that's not the solution.
The solution is take the guns away.

2734
02:04:15,670 --> 02:04:18,470
I don't like the idea of armed security 
at school.

2735
02:04:18,471 --> 02:04:19,304
I don't like the idea of doctors,
I don't like the idea of arming 

2736
02:04:21,291 --> 02:04:22,124
teachers,
but it's like to just dismiss that and 

2737
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:25,034
be like,
no gun control.

2738
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:27,620
The only reasonable measure I think is 
naive.

2739
02:04:27,621 --> 02:04:29,360
But just to the point,
like you were saying before,

2740
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:30,710
I have no problem with people being 
like,

2741
02:04:30,711 --> 02:04:32,990
hey,
cnn shouldn't just be putting these kids

2742
02:04:32,991 --> 02:04:33,824
on without having someone to rebut it or
they shouldn't be putting this on and 

2743
02:04:36,171 --> 02:04:38,010
just say,
but to go at the

2744
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,780
kid and be like,
oh,

2745
02:04:39,781 --> 02:04:41,060
this kid's fucking,
you know,

2746
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:43,650
just milking this experience like 
whatever.

2747
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:45,600
Any of us would do a thing like that.

2748
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:46,840
Look,
I,

2749
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:47,420
you know,
I,

2750
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:49,380
I don't,
I don't have a horse in the race.

2751
02:04:49,381 --> 02:04:50,214
I don't really give a shit.
I don't really shoot guns and I know 

2752
02:04:51,670 --> 02:04:53,820
he's the only one I've shot guns.
It's just been really fun.

2753
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:56,700
There's no part of me that like,
I think I would swallow it a little more

2754
02:04:56,701 --> 02:05:00,360
of people that like were really a big 
gun advocates,

2755
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:01,830
which is kind of admit that like,
dude,

2756
02:05:01,850 --> 02:05:03,270
it's pretty awesome.
We want to blow shit up.

2757
02:05:03,330 --> 02:05:04,530
It's fucking great.
You know?

2758
02:05:04,900 --> 02:05:05,733
Um,
but you get this other sort of thing 

2759
02:05:06,841 --> 02:05:09,330
where I just think that you should have 
people that are really trained,

2760
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,193
really responsible and we should have 
specific measures in place in order and 

2761
02:05:14,761 --> 02:05:15,594
I know we do have that,
but maybe we should look at it and push 

2762
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:19,710
that line back even a little bit more 
because yeah,

2763
02:05:19,711 --> 02:05:21,300
you're right.
Even in the example of the dude,

2764
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:22,980
you know,
taking out that kid in that school,

2765
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:24,233
I don't necessarily have an issue with 
having an armed security guard at the 

2766
02:05:25,831 --> 02:05:26,664
school to protect children,
but I kind of have an issue with 

2767
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:29,784
somebody who you don't know when his 
girlfriend broke up with him and when 

2768
02:05:32,821 --> 02:05:34,200
this dude went bat shit.
Right.

2769
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:36,930
So even when you have to get people's 
psychological exams,

2770
02:05:36,931 --> 02:05:37,764
like when do they go crazy?
When is there a moment where somebody 

2771
02:05:38,701 --> 02:05:40,250
snaps and now they're fucking crazy,
right?

2772
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:41,133
I actually,
I'm

2773
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:44,480
really against gun control of just about
any kind.

2774
02:05:44,550 --> 02:05:47,010
I know.
I actually think when people,

2775
02:05:47,011 --> 02:05:49,770
a lot of times Republicans will go,
it's not about gun control,

2776
02:05:49,771 --> 02:05:50,604
it's about mental health.
I think that's even more of a copout 

2777
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:53,573
because you're like,
what the fuck are you even saying by 

2778
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:55,660
that?
Like what do you,

2779
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:56,640
you know,
there's lots of,

2780
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:57,503
when you say mental health,
it's like there's lots of people who 

2781
02:05:59,191 --> 02:06:01,890
suffer from anxiety and depression,
all these things.

2782
02:06:01,891 --> 02:06:03,600
It doesn't mean they're a risk to 
others.

2783
02:06:03,610 --> 02:06:05,190
Like what?
What are you actually going to say?

2784
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:06,024
Like I'm for unfettered gun rights,
but everyone has to have like a 

2785
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:10,374
psychological exam and it's as if 
there's some way that we can predict 

2786
02:06:12,991 --> 02:06:14,610
who's going to shoot up a fucking 
school.

2787
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,280
And the truth of the matter is it's 
really fucking tough.

2788
02:06:17,470 --> 02:06:18,303
It definitely is.
But what you're saying is entirely 

2789
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:23,430
correct because it is absolutely about 
mental health and you have to be fucking

2790
02:06:23,431 --> 02:06:24,540
crazy to be a school shooter.

2791
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:25,733
Yeah.
And most of these people are on some 

2792
02:06:27,451 --> 02:06:31,020
sort of psychiatric medicine.
There's a giant percentage of them.

2793
02:06:31,200 --> 02:06:32,033
So it is in fact a mental health issue 
because there are there literally on 

2794
02:06:34,980 --> 02:06:35,813
most of them,
like the vast percentage of them are on 

2795
02:06:37,951 --> 02:06:38,784
mental health medication.
So the question is whether or not it's 

2796
02:06:42,271 --> 02:06:43,104
the mental health medication that's 
causing them to do this shit or whether 

2797
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:49,710
or not they were already crazy and that 
medication was just trying to treat this

2798
02:06:49,711 --> 02:06:52,530
disease and they got ahold of guns and 
that's the problem is the guns.

2799
02:06:52,531 --> 02:06:53,364
Yeah.
So maybe I didn't say that like 

2800
02:06:53,821 --> 02:06:56,070
precisely enough because I agree with 
everything you just said.

2801
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:57,900
I'm just making the point that the idea 
that it's like,

2802
02:06:57,930 --> 02:06:58,763
oh all we know is that there's this 
category of people who have mental 

2803
02:07:00,541 --> 02:07:03,510
health issues and they shouldn't be 
allowed to get guns is way too broad.

2804
02:07:03,720 --> 02:07:04,531
But no,
I actually,

2805
02:07:04,531 --> 02:07:07,140
I think again,
like you mentioned earlier,

2806
02:07:07,141 --> 02:07:09,000
it's like dude,
they say these.

2807
02:07:09,090 --> 02:07:09,923
Anyone who's real fucked up nowadays as 
a lot of mental health issues a lot and 

2808
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:15,330
is in school,
they're going to put them on trucks.

2809
02:07:15,420 --> 02:07:17,160
They put anyone who's borderline on 
drugs.

2810
02:07:17,161 --> 02:07:17,994
So the really fucked up kids on like a 
cocktail of drugs and no admit with a 

2811
02:07:21,181 --> 02:07:22,014
lot of these antidepressants,
anti psychotics that they can cause 

2812
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:25,673
suicidal tendencies.
Some of you will even say they cause 

2813
02:07:28,021 --> 02:07:28,854
homicidal tendencies.
So I think it's pretty reasonable that 

2814
02:07:32,191 --> 02:07:36,250
maybe in some very small percentage of 
them they cause you to just fucking

2815
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,083
want to go,
or they push you at least in the 

2816
02:07:38,081 --> 02:07:38,914
direction of wanting to go,
just shoot up a bunch of people to 

2817
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:41,923
relief the,
relieve you of the feeling of 

2818
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:45,160
consequences.
There's,

2819
02:07:45,161 --> 02:07:45,994
they're there,
they disassociate you from whatever 

2820
02:07:47,531 --> 02:07:48,364
you're experiencing.
That's one of the most disconcerting 

2821
02:07:50,981 --> 02:07:51,814
things about the idea that if someone 
has homicidal thoughts but they're 

2822
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:55,294
keeping them at bay,
and then they take some pill that 

2823
02:07:57,161 --> 02:07:57,910
saying,
hey,

2824
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:59,080
fuck it,
let's do this.

2825
02:07:59,110 --> 02:08:02,170
Let's do this.
You're not exercising the whatever,

2826
02:08:02,171 --> 02:08:06,160
the mental processes of not killing 
people on your own.

2827
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:08,500
You need this thing to do it and then 
you don't have your medication.

2828
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:10,600
One day I heard you talk about this the 
other day was kind of interesting.

2829
02:08:10,601 --> 02:08:13,270
I forget who was on people whose metzker
or somebody,

2830
02:08:13,271 --> 02:08:15,520
but you were talking about people that 
she was very calm,

2831
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:18,590
cool and collected,
relaxed on that episode.

2832
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,870
It was weird.
The best,

2833
02:08:19,871 --> 02:08:20,704
uh,
the best advertisement for Caveman 

2834
02:08:22,031 --> 02:08:25,420
nitrile you could possibly,
it will make you into a raving madman.

2835
02:08:25,480 --> 02:08:28,030
The Maryland school shooter was killed 
by his own bullet,

2836
02:08:28,031 --> 02:08:30,660
not the school resource officer.
Police said,

2837
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:33,040
oh,
he shot himself in the head when the guy

2838
02:08:33,041 --> 02:08:34,100
was coming after him.
Okay.

2839
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:39,130
But still kind of a similar moral of the
story that maybe the guy behind him made

2840
02:08:39,131 --> 02:08:41,830
him shoot himself and this is definitely
not the same story.

2841
02:08:41,831 --> 02:08:44,050
The story was that this arm,
God took him out.

2842
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,071
Yes.
That's what.

2843
02:08:45,071 --> 02:08:47,080
That's what I heard as well.
That's what I had heard.

2844
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,113
I had heard a deceptive version of it 
then because I heard that this guy 

2845
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:55,390
engaged in a firefight with this kid and
killed him instantly.

2846
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:56,560
Yeah.
That's what I read.

2847
02:08:56,561 --> 02:08:59,200
Like six different articles that said 
that.

2848
02:08:59,230 --> 02:08:59,891
Yeah.
Okay.

2849
02:08:59,891 --> 02:09:02,530
So that maybe that's incorrect or 
there's too many things to pay attention

2850
02:09:02,531 --> 02:09:03,364
to.

2851
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:08,320
Is a shot.
Hit the shooters gun in his hand.

2852
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:10,950
His shot hit the shooters gun before 
having to shoot.

2853
02:09:11,010 --> 02:09:12,070
Shoot her,
shot himself.

2854
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:15,940
He shot himself with a gun that got 
shot.

2855
02:09:16,140 --> 02:09:18,880
I said the officer,
the officer shot struck rollins gun,

2856
02:09:18,881 --> 02:09:21,070
which was in the teens hand.
The sheriff's office said,

2857
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,920
nevertheless,
his quick action confronting rollins.

2858
02:09:23,921 --> 02:09:27,430
Just three minutes after the shot to 
students has been credited with bringing

2859
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:29,950
the incident to a quicker.
So the guy did shoot the kid.

2860
02:09:29,951 --> 02:09:30,530
Yeah,
but they,

2861
02:09:30,530 --> 02:09:32,350
he hit his gun.
Killed him.

2862
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:33,580
Yeah.
So he,

2863
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:36,340
he shot him and then when the.
After the guy shot him,

2864
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:38,540
he just shot himself while he's still 
could praise.

2865
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,380
Praise came even when it was unclear 
which shot killed the teen,

2866
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:46,810
but he definitely seems like he shot 
him.

2867
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:47,830
I mean,
he was in the fire.

2868
02:09:47,890 --> 02:09:49,810
He really wasn't a firefight with this 
fucking guy.

2869
02:09:50,860 --> 02:09:51,621
I don't know,
Dude.

2870
02:09:51,621 --> 02:09:52,454
I look,
I think there's not a single answer to 

2871
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,200
any of this.
I think it is definitely a mental health

2872
02:09:56,201 --> 02:09:57,460
issue.
I think you're not gonna.

2873
02:09:57,490 --> 02:10:00,220
Nobody's gonna come up with a law that's
going to figure all this shit out.

2874
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:02,260
I just,
I don't live.

2875
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,080
I joked about it before,
but I,

2876
02:10:04,081 --> 02:10:04,914
I kind of lived my life in a sort of 
ignorance is bliss state with this type 

2877
02:10:07,811 --> 02:10:09,190
of shit.
I mean,

2878
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,100
I don't know.
I,

2879
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:15,070
I have to guess my kid's not going to be
shot to death in a school one day.

2880
02:10:15,130 --> 02:10:16,150
Knock on wood.
Right.

2881
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:16,631
I know,
and it's,

2882
02:10:16,631 --> 02:10:17,980
and it's a horrible,
horrible thing.

2883
02:10:18,570 --> 02:10:20,500
Um,
but the reality is I don't know if these

2884
02:10:20,501 --> 02:10:21,334
people that are so obsessed with 
everything and just they're making it 

2885
02:10:22,991 --> 02:10:23,824
their lives,
I almost feel like they're kind of 

2886
02:10:24,941 --> 02:10:26,930
missing the point if I,
my,

2887
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:27,833
my kid isn't gonna be out at a rally 
holding a sign and I'm not spending my 

2888
02:10:29,711 --> 02:10:30,544
days doing that with them.
I'm spending my days creating memories 

2889
02:10:32,021 --> 02:10:34,220
with him and just trying to spend my 
life making a good life

2890
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:36,920
and I'm not really politicizing anything
with my five year old.

2891
02:10:37,500 --> 02:10:38,240
Well,
well,

2892
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:41,270
there's people that feel like they want 
to do something to want change.

2893
02:10:41,540 --> 02:10:44,150
They don't want this to happen again.
And if you lost your kid,

2894
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:45,950
he'd probably feel that way to me.
Oh yeah,

2895
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:46,701
sure.
I mean there's,

2896
02:10:46,701 --> 02:10:47,534
there's,
there's way too many of these things is 

2897
02:10:48,711 --> 02:10:50,840
way too many of them.
So we got to figure out what it is.

2898
02:10:50,990 --> 02:10:54,110
I think the real issue resolved realize 
rather,

2899
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:54,860
um,
it,

2900
02:10:54,860 --> 02:10:56,060
it lies.
Here's one,

2901
02:10:56,120 --> 02:10:56,953
one giant part of the problem.
Everybody's looking at the final piece 

2902
02:10:59,841 --> 02:11:01,820
of the puzzle,
the final piece of the puzzle.

2903
02:11:01,821 --> 02:11:03,260
It all comes together.
Is the school shooting?

2904
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:08,740
What gets someone to that position?
How do they get to that?

2905
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:11,870
You gotta go to step one,
not to step 10.

2906
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:14,540
Step 10 is a school shooting you gotta,
you gotTa.

2907
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:17,840
Figure out how do we get less people to 
go from step one to step two?

2908
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:21,050
How do we keep more people happy as 
young people?

2909
02:11:21,051 --> 02:11:21,884
How do we give more people support 
headed when we give more people therapy 

2910
02:11:24,801 --> 02:11:25,634
or exercise or recreation or friendship 
or community guidance or whatever the 

2911
02:11:29,571 --> 02:11:30,404
fuck we're doing,
where we alienate people to the point 

2912
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:34,370
where they literally want to go and 
shoot everybody else.

2913
02:11:34,371 --> 02:11:35,400
It's like the,
the,

2914
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:39,710
the physical equivalent of like flipping
over a game when you're losing,

2915
02:11:39,910 --> 02:11:40,710
you know,
I,

2916
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:41,421
I think,
yeah,

2917
02:11:41,421 --> 02:11:44,390
that's a great analogy by the way.
I think that's exactly what it is.

2918
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,051
It's like,
oh,

2919
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:47,360
this world is so bad for me.
Well Fuck,

2920
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:50,390
you can make it for everybody.
Fuck that.

2921
02:11:50,391 --> 02:11:51,224
Nice teacher.
I've thought I completely agree with 

2922
02:11:52,491 --> 02:11:54,770
what you're saying and I think maybe the
silver lining in this,

2923
02:11:54,771 --> 02:11:55,604
like the best thing that could come out 
of this and it has nothing to do with 

2924
02:11:57,351 --> 02:11:58,184
the law,
is just that kids in high school will 

2925
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,333
think twice before they're brutally 
ostracizing some other kid because 

2926
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:05,000
you're like,
hey,

2927
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,810
watch out.
That kid might be the one who

2928
02:12:08,260 --> 02:12:11,200
maybe not people.
Kids think they're invincible.

2929
02:12:11,201 --> 02:12:12,880
They're not thinking about that.
I remember when I,

2930
02:12:13,090 --> 02:12:13,923
you know,
columbine was so such a big news story 

2931
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:17,290
when I was.
I was in high school,

2932
02:12:17,291 --> 02:12:19,600
I believe at the time.
I'm sure.

2933
02:12:19,700 --> 02:12:20,441
Yeah.
It's your birthday.

2934
02:12:20,441 --> 02:12:25,441
Actually.
My birthday real fucked up and dude,

2935
02:12:26,321 --> 02:12:28,020
it was fucking,
it was such a big deal.

2936
02:12:28,430 --> 02:12:30,460
I had never seen anything like that 
before.

2937
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:32,080
Um,
this is before nine slash 11.

2938
02:12:32,081 --> 02:12:34,000
Nine slash 11 was the next big,
big thing.

2939
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:38,560
But it happens so often now that because
of the Internet,

2940
02:12:38,561 --> 02:12:39,394
I almost feel like people are also 
desensitized to like how crazy it was 

2941
02:12:42,161 --> 02:12:42,994
because columbine dude,
it was bizarre watching the images on 

2942
02:12:45,911 --> 02:12:47,830
the news of the people of running out of
that school.

2943
02:12:47,831 --> 02:12:48,664
It was like haunting and I remember 
watching it and my mom made this point 

2944
02:12:50,951 --> 02:12:52,750
and shoot my mom a fucking drug addict,
lunatic.

2945
02:12:52,751 --> 02:12:53,584
But she had these weird little moments 
in her life when she said some crazy 

2946
02:12:55,601 --> 02:12:56,890
shit.
And she was like,

2947
02:12:56,891 --> 02:12:57,331
yeah.
She like,

2948
02:12:57,331 --> 02:12:57,851
you know what?
Yeah,

2949
02:12:57,851 --> 02:13:00,520
maybe they shouldn't have fucked with 
those kids just in a weird way.

2950
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:01,810
And I was like,
Oh damn,

2951
02:13:01,811 --> 02:13:04,480
I'm really good at defending these like,
but you just kinda.

2952
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:06,820
It wasn't defending the active people 
getting killed,

2953
02:13:07,030 --> 02:13:09,790
but it was sort of looking at the root 
with which is what you're saying.

2954
02:13:09,791 --> 02:13:10,630
And,
and she,

2955
02:13:10,650 --> 02:13:11,860
you know,
she's kind of made that point.

2956
02:13:11,861 --> 02:13:12,910
I kind of always stuck with me

2957
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:15,810
even more than like,
which I get the point,

2958
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:17,220
but even more than other kids bullying 
him.

2959
02:13:17,221 --> 02:13:19,440
The truth is if you want to get it the 
route you want to be like,

2960
02:13:19,441 --> 02:13:20,274
Hey,
parents fucking love your kids and give 

2961
02:13:22,141 --> 02:13:24,030
them a really good childhood.
But it's like,

2962
02:13:24,031 --> 02:13:26,540
how do you actually make that happen?
There's a narrative,

2963
02:13:26,550 --> 02:13:29,820
difficult natural inclination that 
animals have to pick on the weaker ones.

2964
02:13:29,821 --> 02:13:34,470
It's a terrible natural of the human 
beings have to avoid because chickens do

2965
02:13:34,471 --> 02:13:35,250
it.
I've chickens,

2966
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:35,941
chickens,
fuck.

2967
02:13:35,941 --> 02:13:38,780
With the smaller chickens and the less 
aggressive chickens,

2968
02:13:38,781 --> 02:13:40,710
they fucked them up.
They have a pecking order.

2969
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:41,823
You know,
I've seen it with dogs would one dog 

2970
02:13:43,081 --> 02:13:44,940
becomes the alpha of the pack,
takes over,

2971
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:47,280
dominates the other dogs is a natural 
thing.

2972
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:48,203
It's natural.
It's natural in every single animal 

2973
02:13:50,281 --> 02:13:51,114
community and it's natural with people.
But we're smart and we understand the 

2974
02:13:54,301 --> 02:13:57,840
consequences of that and you've got to 
give those kids a reason to not do that,

2975
02:13:58,210 --> 02:13:59,043
you know?
But there's also the problem with like 

2976
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:01,890
if you're going to school with Lebron 
James,

2977
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:05,250
okay,
like standing next to this fucking giant

2978
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:06,260
super athlete,
you're like,

2979
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:08,130
shit,
kinda bullshit.

2980
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:11,940
Genetic roll the dice that I can get.
This motherfucker got all aces.

2981
02:14:11,941 --> 02:14:14,670
He's got five aces,
like seven feet tall.

2982
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:16,650
He weighs 300 pounds and he moves like a
pant.

2983
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:20,600
There's no,
there's no basis to win.

2984
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:22,770
And that's.
I love that analogy specifically because

2985
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,233
it's so stupid.
I have a tattoo on my arm and it's just 

2986
02:14:25,381 --> 02:14:27,410
a to seven off suit.
I'm a poker player,

2987
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:28,560
but it's.
That's the analogy.

2988
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:29,280
It's like,
take it off.

2989
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:30,260
Take that tattoo man.
Fuck.

2990
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:32,390
It's such to such a bad client.
No,

2991
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:33,600
you have no idea,
dude.

2992
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,330
It's the worst and you thought about 
doing anything about it.

2993
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:38,790
I have one cover up.
I have one that says Lou dog.

2994
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:40,060
My first one ever,
boy,

2995
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:43,410
nobody even call me Lou dog.
They just did sarcastically.

2996
02:14:43,411 --> 02:14:48,411
After I got that nickname it introducing
myself a nickname.

2997
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:54,030
I was 18.
I was like,

2998
02:14:54,031 --> 02:14:56,160
I need a tattoo.
What can I get in my mind?

2999
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:56,994
Could only go to Lou dog.
That is one of the juiciest thing a 

3000
02:14:58,801 --> 02:14:59,634
human being could do,
is give themselves a neck tattoo on 

3001
02:15:02,071 --> 02:15:02,550
their body.

3002
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:04,870
If you just decide.
I mean,

3003
02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:10,200
I'm not talking about like a pro 
wrestler mean for fighters.

3004
02:15:10,201 --> 02:15:12,630
It's pretty commonplace,
but for the average person,

3005
02:15:13,530 --> 02:15:14,363
my friends call me Lou dog.
Nobody calls told me their friend at 

3006
02:15:17,731 --> 02:15:18,564
that point.
It wasn't good at defending any of this 

3007
02:15:22,051 --> 02:15:24,810
shit.
Already been a good.

3008
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:30,480
Like everything is fat.
Arms was a fat kid,

3009
02:15:31,111 --> 02:15:31,944
so I said Lou dog and really small 
because I could only afford a $60 

3010
02:15:33,811 --> 02:15:34,644
tattoo,
a little petite Lou dog and then below 

3011
02:15:36,391 --> 02:15:38,370
it,
it wasn't even the full thing that could

3012
02:15:38,371 --> 02:15:40,800
connect around my arm.
It was just a little bit of tribal,

3013
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:44,010
just like a slipper,
like a two inch sliver of tribal.

3014
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,360
What?
How is a kid in high school?

3015
02:15:45,690 --> 02:15:49,920
Most of the guys that were doing tattoos
weren't good artists.

3016
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:50,923
There was a few good artists.
You would find them in magazines and 

3017
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:55,980
Shit and he'd have to travel to 
Connecticut to get a tattoo done.

3018
02:15:56,400 --> 02:15:57,900
It was.
It was weird.

3019
02:15:57,930 --> 02:15:58,763
It wasn't like it is now.
Like now the artists are going from art 

3020
02:16:02,341 --> 02:16:07,260
school right into tattooing and you're 
getting these amazing pieces.

3021
02:16:07,261 --> 02:16:10,740
I mean it's.
I've never seen tattoos like today in my

3022
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:12,330
life.
I saw one the other day.

3023
02:16:12,450 --> 02:16:16,680
Some guy had Michael Jordan tattooed.
It looked like a leg or an arm.

3024
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:19,920
I couldn't tell what it was,
but it's like they took a photograph and

3025
02:16:19,921 --> 02:16:21,310
just wrapped around this guy's okay

3026
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:22,620
leg.
It's insane.

3027
02:16:22,700 --> 02:16:23,533
Yeah.
Now you go on the Internet and you can 

3028
02:16:24,090 --> 02:16:24,923
actually see all the art and just 
compare it and pick and choose and 

3029
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:29,950
they're just way more artists and way 
more people getting tattoos are

3030
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,770
so much bigger market because the gun,
the guns they use.

3031
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:36,320
Like my buddy tattoos me a shout out,
Keith Carmelo Tattoos.

3032
02:16:36,390 --> 02:16:39,250
Shout out to Karen Mellow Keith.
He's the fucking man.

3033
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:41,290
Great Tattoo artist kid.
Now he's got a nickname.

3034
02:16:42,380 --> 02:16:46,780
He didn't give it to himself so it's not
out of long island,

3035
02:16:46,781 --> 02:16:48,610
dude.
And he's got these guns.

3036
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:50,080
Whatever he does.
He was an expensive,

3037
02:16:50,081 --> 02:16:53,690
like German fucking engineered gun and 
it just doesn't look at that.

3038
02:16:53,700 --> 02:16:56,010
That's cool.
Cool.

3039
02:16:56,110 --> 02:17:00,070
Somebody got Tom Segura tattooed with 
some sort of a viking hat on.

3040
02:17:00,071 --> 02:17:02,950
What does that have?
Samurai Samurai hat.

3041
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:03,993
Oh right.
That's an Okinawan symbol on his 

3042
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:06,364
forehead.
We get a lot of the legion of Skanks 

3043
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:14,400
Logo Tattoo or a Samurai artists just 
like made a thing and he offered to give

3044
02:17:14,891 --> 02:17:17,020
someone a deal if they like tatted it on
them.

3045
02:17:17,021 --> 02:17:19,150
Dad is hilarious.
That's amazing.

3046
02:17:19,180 --> 02:17:22,360
Look how good the microphone looks.
Fuck this guy's good.

3047
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:23,380
What's.
What is this name?

3048
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:25,990
Jamie Lee Parker.
Jamie Lee Parker.

3049
02:17:25,991 --> 02:17:28,090
Hidden Los Angeles Tattoo.
West Hills,

3050
02:17:28,091 --> 02:17:29,380
California.
Damn,

3051
02:17:29,381 --> 02:17:31,900
that guy's good.
That guy's really good.

3052
02:17:31,930 --> 02:17:33,340
Holy Shit.
See,

3053
02:17:33,341 --> 02:17:35,890
that's what I'm talking about.
Like these are real artists.

3054
02:17:35,891 --> 02:17:38,110
Like look how good that joke or is.
That's insane.

3055
02:17:38,111 --> 02:17:41,590
Yeah.
These are real artists who are really.

3056
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:42,603
Like when I was a kid there was a lot of
guys who would just take one of those 

3057
02:17:45,101 --> 02:17:46,960
things off the wall and they'll go,
oh,

3058
02:17:46,961 --> 02:17:47,794
you want a black panther on your.
I'm sticking it on your arm and pull it 

3059
02:17:52,241 --> 02:17:53,074
down,
and then they would just start tracing 

3060
02:17:54,311 --> 02:17:56,380
that line.
They do a shitty job of doing it.

3061
02:17:56,410 --> 02:17:58,930
A lot of my friends got these dog shit 
tattoos.

3062
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:00,033
A lot of them was the Black Panther with
the claws cutting into the skin and the 

3063
02:18:03,010 --> 02:18:03,843
clause would be red bull.
So students are like stupid things like 

3064
02:18:06,011 --> 02:18:07,240
tweety bird tattoos on the wall.

3065
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:09,220
I was like,
who the fuck would ever choose that?

3066
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:10,083
Lot of people.
My mom had like straight up jailhouse 

3067
02:18:12,171 --> 02:18:14,560
tattoo,
so my mom had a money sign that was done

3068
02:18:14,561 --> 02:18:19,450
with a ash with a needle into her hand.
Get to get that paper.

3069
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,910
I understand that.
It's ironic,

3070
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:22,744
right?
We gotta do what you gotTa do to get 

3071
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:25,713
that paper.
Let everybody know there's this weird 

3072
02:18:27,461 --> 02:18:29,650
tattoos that just like own a period in 
time,

3073
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:34,680
like the barbwire tramp stamp.
Even a little bit like that.

3074
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,020
Like the nineties kind of thing that 
you're like,

3075
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:40,600
oh no.
Was a dude with a tramp stamp.

3076
02:18:40,601 --> 02:18:41,890
He's got a butterfly.
Tramp stamp.

3077
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:44,230
Thank God.
Why?

3078
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:45,820
I don't know.
And there were no.

3079
02:18:45,950 --> 02:18:47,080
Yeah,
he just got it.

3080
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,220
It's kind of funny,
I guess.

3081
02:18:48,221 --> 02:18:50,500
It's funny.
Kind of funny.

3082
02:18:50,850 --> 02:18:53,400
What is Russian prison?
Prison Tattoos?

3083
02:18:53,460 --> 02:18:54,293
Yeah.
Yeah.

3084
02:18:54,430 --> 02:18:55,600
Books about in a pretty dope.

3085
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:58,570
Well,
there's one fader million acre,

3086
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:03,100
his brother fair to Faye doors,
brother Alex Alexander,

3087
02:19:03,101 --> 02:19:03,934
a million acres.
He's got a bunch of crazy Russian 

3088
02:19:06,011 --> 02:19:10,300
tattoos on his body and he had mob 
tattoos on his chest,

3089
02:19:10,510 --> 02:19:11,080
on his,
uh,

3090
02:19:11,080 --> 02:19:15,130
right in front of his doubts and he got 
them both redone and switched over.

3091
02:19:15,580 --> 02:19:19,190
He's fucking Jack now,
Jack.

3092
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:20,050
Really?
Yeah,

3093
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:22,960
because they were never really.
Jacqueline Alexander,

3094
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:23,794
a million inco recent muscles picture.
He just came back because that was part 

3095
02:19:28,971 --> 02:19:31,900
of their charm and those guys,
he doesn't drink.

3096
02:19:32,170 --> 02:19:33,340
Yeah,
I just stretch for rate.

3097
02:19:33,890 --> 02:19:34,700
Yeah.
Yeah,

3098
02:19:34,700 --> 02:19:36,320
and he came out,
was fighting with Hep c.

3099
02:19:36,321 --> 02:19:37,790
he's like a fucking.
Just a bad,

3100
02:19:37,791 --> 02:19:39,040
scary look.
Oh yeah.

3101
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:41,240
He's Super Jack.
That's a good picture.

3102
02:19:41,241 --> 02:19:44,360
But there's a better picture of him,
like facing head on where you go,

3103
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:45,194
Holy Shit.
Like he's like legitimate now that's on 

3104
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:47,990
it.
Whatever.

3105
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:48,830
But you get the point.

3106
02:19:48,830 --> 02:19:51,350
That's what he used to look like.
I used to look like a bear.

3107
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:52,593
He used to have like,
like our got a little bit of that right 

3108
02:19:54,351 --> 02:19:55,970
here.
A little bit of fat right here.

3109
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:58,570
He's got like a little bit of that like 
right there.

3110
02:19:58,850 --> 02:19:59,710
So he's.
Yeah,

3111
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:00,553
because that's the part of the charm of 
the Mammalian NGOs was that they were 

3112
02:20:02,661 --> 02:20:04,100
almost kind of like,
just looked like that.

3113
02:20:04,101 --> 02:20:05,780
Like we don't even give a fuck.
We're just tough.

3114
02:20:05,781 --> 02:20:07,250
Russians didn't care.
Yeah.

3115
02:20:07,251 --> 02:20:10,720
He got ahold of that fucking shit.
Look at his left in Israel.

3116
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:12,400
Go back to that picture real quick.
Look at those.

3117
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:15,380
The tattoos on his pack on his right and
his left side.

3118
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:16,810
Like you see him there.
Those,

3119
02:20:16,930 --> 02:20:17,763
that's when they were a Russian gang 
tattoo and he's got a woman on his back 

3120
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:25,460
like I know a skeleton holding a baby 
tattooed on his back.

3121
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:27,890
Have you seen his back?
Is the creepy shit?

3122
02:20:28,340 --> 02:20:29,480
Go See.
Go Up.

3123
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:33,230
Pull up back tattoo.
That'll get us back.

3124
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:38,150
It's fucking crazy skeleton holding a 
baby.

3125
02:20:38,151 --> 02:20:40,500
Like what?
Okay.

3126
02:20:42,670 --> 02:20:47,670
I just don't do only one thing.
Only skittled holding babies.

3127
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:53,160
That's the scariest image you can think 
of.

3128
02:20:53,440 --> 02:20:55,520
The holding baby,
his life.

3129
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:57,980
This is what they want to tell the 
world.

3130
02:20:57,981 --> 02:21:00,380
When you see my back,
I am skeleton holding.

3131
02:21:00,381 --> 02:21:02,270
Baby.
Baby has soared to it.

3132
02:21:02,271 --> 02:21:03,104
Now do it and up bat.
It does for the baby kill skeleton and 

3133
02:21:07,581 --> 02:21:12,440
this buts of the moon in the butts in 
the moon and the bats fly.

3134
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:18,940
You mess up just in south beach 
describing the fucking tattoo.

3135
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:22,000
Then it's so evil.
Mullins.

3136
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:24,550
What does that mean?
Well,

3137
02:21:24,560 --> 02:21:26,000
it's.
I don't think it's American.

3138
02:21:26,030 --> 02:21:28,020
I think that's a Russian words.
Right?

3139
02:21:28,050 --> 02:21:30,450
So who knows what it says?
Yeah.

3140
02:21:30,620 --> 02:21:32,890
Yeah man.
That Russian language.

3141
02:21:32,891 --> 02:21:34,160
It's a trip to look at it,
man.

3142
02:21:34,161 --> 02:21:36,250
When you see Russian type down,
you like what?

3143
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:38,210
You guys?
How long have you been doing this?

3144
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:41,850
How cold hungry were you,
but you came up with this shit.

3145
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:44,180
This is the Third Reich.
God with us.

3146
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:48,840
It says it's Third Reich Shit.
Oh fuck.

3147
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:55,620
Alexander on the Whoa.
God with us as a phrase commonly used in

3148
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,250
Harold.
Harold.

3149
02:21:58,630 --> 02:22:00,920
Harold in Prussia from 17.
Oh,

3150
02:22:00,921 --> 02:22:02,420
one and later.
Okay.

3151
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:05,450
Per pressure first.
So does it has its roots in Prussia?

3152
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:06,500
Yeah.
Okay.

3153
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:09,670
The German military during period 
spanning the German empire.

3154
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:14,660
Eighteen 71 to 1918.
And so it was World War One and then the

3155
02:22:14,660 --> 02:22:17,570
Third Reich 1933 to 45.
So it was in the first two bikes on.

3156
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:20,510
It wasn't just the third,
but the most important thing is that the

3157
02:22:20,511 --> 02:22:22,580
origins are pressure.
Right.

3158
02:22:22,581 --> 02:22:24,560
And so he's very nationalistic,
I'm sure.

3159
02:22:24,590 --> 02:22:27,270
Yeah.
I still couldn't be you to be luck,

3160
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:27,841
dude.
Oh,

3161
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:28,980
today's Day and age,
you know,

3162
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:34,090
we all know the swastika.
It has other meetings before the Germans

3163
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:36,120
took over,
but you can't get a swastika tattoo.

3164
02:22:36,270 --> 02:22:38,730
Nah,
but it's a good one I'm talking about is

3165
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:40,620
the cry of the Swedish army.

3166
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:43,650
See it's in 16,
31.

3167
02:22:43,651 --> 02:22:44,484
It was done.
It was saying got men on Owens by 

3168
02:22:47,581 --> 02:22:48,414
sabotage during the battle of Britain 
field and 1631 God with us with the war 

3169
02:22:53,041 --> 02:22:54,900
cry of the Swedish,
the Swedish army.

3170
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,540
It was the last time Sweden was picking 
wars with anybody.

3171
02:22:57,541 --> 02:23:00,750
So this is probably like some Russian 
gang shit is what we were missing.

3172
02:23:00,751 --> 02:23:01,584
Like God is with us,
meaning God is with the Russian gang 

3173
02:23:03,901 --> 02:23:04,734
members and we're just jumping into 
conclusions because the Nazis liked it 

3174
02:23:06,871 --> 02:23:07,710
too.
Yeah.

3175
02:23:07,711 --> 02:23:08,544
And we're also like in America,
like Nazis are such a symbol of evil 

3176
02:23:11,341 --> 02:23:12,174
shit.
I don't know exactly in his culture in 

3177
02:23:13,951 --> 02:23:16,440
Russia where they're from,
if that's like fucking,

3178
02:23:16,441 --> 02:23:17,580
you know,
Hitler is this,

3179
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:18,051
you know,
the,

3180
02:23:18,051 --> 02:23:20,130
the,
the antichrist that we can make them out

3181
02:23:20,131 --> 02:23:22,770
to beat the Nazis didn't get along very 
well.

3182
02:23:22,771 --> 02:23:24,150
They also had their own guy.

3183
02:23:24,210 --> 02:23:25,043
They had stolen just starving people and
he was responsible for one more deaths 

3184
02:23:27,990 --> 02:23:31,110
and he was responsible for their deaths.
Like dabs on people.

3185
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:31,531
Yeah.
Yeah.

3186
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:32,364
I mean,
Hitler killed a lot of Russians to 

3187
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:38,460
everybody killed Russians.
Russians get fucked up,

3188
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:39,810
man.
That's why they're so hardy.

3189
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:42,030
That's why they're so dangerous as like 
fighters.

3190
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:43,043
Those are the survivors man.
So when you got some cream of the crop 

3191
02:23:45,241 --> 02:23:49,650
genetics over in Russia,
no bullshit in fucking in like a hundred

3192
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:50,300
year period.
Russia,

3193
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:50,911
not because,
you know,

3194
02:23:50,911 --> 02:23:53,190
like America was in two world wars,
but it wasn't here.

3195
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:55,500
It was like we went and we send our boys
to go fight over there.

3196
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:56,453
Russia had two world wars.
They're country straight up collapsed 

3197
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:01,823
twice.
They had the Bolshevik revolution and 

3198
02:24:03,661 --> 02:24:04,494
then the collapse of the Soviet Union 
and then they had like just genocidal 

3199
02:24:08,761 --> 02:24:10,720
dictatorship inbetween that.
Yeah.

3200
02:24:10,750 --> 02:24:12,740
There was just a bad time to be rushing.

3201
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:13,833
Well,
they've gone through a whole bunch of 

3202
02:24:14,581 --> 02:24:17,040
those in the past.
When you go look at Russian history,

3203
02:24:17,041 --> 02:24:17,874
like what the fuck?
We went to the gang is con exhibit at 

3204
02:24:22,471 --> 02:24:23,304
the Reagan Library out here.
And you get to see how much of Russia 

3205
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,503
they captured and how much of like I 
didn't know that gang is Khan had the 

3206
02:24:31,681 --> 02:24:36,681
biggest empire ever.
Like they literally owned all of Eurasia

3207
02:24:37,410 --> 02:24:42,090
and he was fucking like 40 percent of 
the people and I mean that dude,

3208
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:43,763
there's some insane number of people 
that are genetically related to him in 

3209
02:24:46,531 --> 02:24:47,364
Asia,
like insane number at that he would 

3210
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:51,030
like,
they would do this shit where they would

3211
02:24:51,031 --> 02:24:51,864
like send like a fuck.
It's been a while since I read about 

3212
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:55,410
this.
But like they would like send it,

3213
02:24:55,411 --> 02:24:57,060
like when they were going to conquer 
like a village,

3214
02:24:57,150 --> 02:24:59,760
they'd like sending a note is basically 
kind of like,

3215
02:24:59,761 --> 02:25:01,980
well look,
just give up all your shit right now and

3216
02:25:01,981 --> 02:25:02,814
you'll be okay.

3217
02:25:02,850 --> 02:25:04,020
And then some of the villages would be 
like,

3218
02:25:04,021 --> 02:25:05,360
no,
we're not giving up all their shapes.

3219
02:25:06,200 --> 02:25:07,290
And then they just come in.
Yeah.

3220
02:25:07,291 --> 02:25:09,390
And then they do that just to like send 
a fucking message.

3221
02:25:09,391 --> 02:25:12,330
Like even people who agreed to it,
they were brutal.

3222
02:25:12,331 --> 02:25:13,164
Brutal Shit.
Have you listened to Dan Carlin's wrath 

3223
02:25:14,721 --> 02:25:17,740
of the cons?
I've talked about it.

3224
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:20,010
If you're a regular listener to this 
podcast,

3225
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:21,270
I apologize for the next couple of 
minutes,

3226
02:25:22,170 --> 02:25:24,400
the greatest fucking podcast series 
ever.

3227
02:25:24,401 --> 02:25:26,980
It's all about Gaviscon.
I have no idea.

3228
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:27,963
I knew he's a bad guy,
but it's like my knowledge of gang is 

3229
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:33,220
con was similar to my current knowledge 
of Alexander the Great.

3230
02:25:33,470 --> 02:25:34,690
It's like hurt.
He was gay.

3231
02:25:36,560 --> 02:25:39,040
He killed a lot of people.
I don't really know.

3232
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:39,471
Yeah,
yeah,

3233
02:25:39,471 --> 02:25:40,304
yeah.
It's in modern Afghanistan that that 

3234
02:25:41,471 --> 02:25:42,304
area,
I don't know Jack Shit about Alexander 

3235
02:25:43,511 --> 02:25:47,290
the Great and that was the same thing 
with gangs con and he was a bad guy.

3236
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:50,470
Conquered a lot of people you know who 
owned the world for awhile,

3237
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:55,720
but Dan Carlin's five part series is so 
God damn good that you just get.

3238
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:56,593
You just.
You just really get a really accurate 

3239
02:25:58,391 --> 02:26:03,280
sense of how insane life was back then 
about what these fucking people did.

3240
02:26:03,670 --> 02:26:04,503
This one story about the corps,
me and Shaw who sent an envoy to Gin 

3241
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:09,753
China and along the way they saw in the 
distance what they thought was a snow 

3242
02:26:12,701 --> 02:26:15,260
covered mountain,
but as they got closer they realize that

3243
02:26:15,261 --> 02:26:19,630
it was a pile of bones.
They killed everyone in the city.

3244
02:26:19,631 --> 02:26:24,400
They killed a million people and stack 
them up and these people were.

3245
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:29,230
They had abandoned the road because the 
road was so overrun with bodies that had

3246
02:26:29,231 --> 02:26:30,064
rotten decade that people are getting 
sick and dying because there were so 

3247
02:26:34,001 --> 02:26:39,001
many bodies had abandoned the road.
That's with anything anyone cares about.

3248
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:40,930
Today,
and this goes for myself too,

3249
02:26:40,931 --> 02:26:43,240
like anyone who's into like issues or 
politics.

3250
02:26:43,330 --> 02:26:45,250
It's like you should always just keep in
mind we have.

3251
02:26:45,251 --> 02:26:46,660
It's so fucking good.
Oh good.

3252
02:26:46,661 --> 02:26:50,320
We have it so good compared to what?
Everybody's happy,

3253
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:52,360
but that's what progress is all about.
We want it so good.

3254
02:26:52,390 --> 02:26:53,740
We want it better.
We want better,

3255
02:26:53,770 --> 02:26:56,500
we want better.
We want to know no this no that,

3256
02:26:56,501 --> 02:26:58,120
no violence,
no sexism,

3257
02:26:58,121 --> 02:26:59,200
no racism,
no nothing.

3258
02:26:59,330 --> 02:27:00,790
You want a better and better and better 
and better,

3259
02:27:00,791 --> 02:27:02,620
and we're going to.
Well now we got some ground.

3260
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:05,620
People are getting more and more excited
about gaining more new ground yet,

3261
02:27:05,621 --> 02:27:07,300
but it's like we're never going to have 
it be perfect.

3262
02:27:07,301 --> 02:27:09,010
So I almost was like,
why though?

3263
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:10,233
Because that's that.
The concept of never being any sort of 

3264
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:13,840
racism,
sexism,

3265
02:27:13,841 --> 02:27:14,674
racism or sexism or you know,
somebody's always going to perceive 

3266
02:27:19,211 --> 02:27:20,290
something as being that.

3267
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:21,190
Right?
So it's gonna.

3268
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:22,043
It's the onus is almost on the quote 
unquote victims sometimes to take the 

3269
02:27:25,061 --> 02:27:26,020
step back and go like,
okay,

3270
02:27:26,021 --> 02:27:28,330
I'm not a victim right now.
I'm a brown person.

3271
02:27:28,331 --> 02:27:29,650
Dude,
if I want to call it racism,

3272
02:27:29,651 --> 02:27:31,810
I can do it every single day of my life 
if I really want to.

3273
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:32,713
Okay.
And I feel like we're never going to 

3274
02:27:33,601 --> 02:27:35,980
have that because it's very addictive to
be a victim.

3275
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:38,590
It's very addictive to feel like you 
were wronged in some way.

3276
02:27:38,591 --> 02:27:39,424
And it's also very addicted to look for 
reasons for it that aren't really 

3277
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:43,430
necessarily your fault,
you know,

3278
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:48,070
doesn't necessarily revenues of a very.
Like I'm helping the world that idea.

3279
02:27:48,071 --> 02:27:49,590
And people feel like they're doing 
something good.

3280
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:52,180
You'll never convince them that no 
matter how ridiculous they might be,

3281
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:54,010
you'll never convince them with my 
thing.

3282
02:27:54,070 --> 02:27:56,800
My biggest beef,
and I agree with you,

3283
02:27:56,801 --> 02:27:57,640
I agree with you too though.

3284
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:59,410
I think there's.
That's how progress happens.

3285
02:27:59,411 --> 02:28:01,350
Like you have to keep wanting to make it
better and better.

3286
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:06,400
My biggest problem with say like the,
the like left wing activists of today is

3287
02:28:06,401 --> 02:28:07,234
that it's like they'll just go.
It's almost like they want to burn it 

3288
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:10,144
down because it's not perfect.
I just appreciate how the steps that 

3289
02:28:13,961 --> 02:28:17,320
we've come and let's go the next step,
but don't burn it down because it can be

3290
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:20,230
a lot worse with way we hold on to ideas
and beliefs.

3291
02:28:20,231 --> 02:28:22,670
It takes several generations for real 
progress to occur.

3292
02:28:22,850 --> 02:28:27,470
The problem right now is there's so much
technological progress that's aiding the

3293
02:28:27,471 --> 02:28:28,304
physical progress.
The progress is taking place far faster 

3294
02:28:30,051 --> 02:28:30,884
than they can handle.
It's almost like going down hill in the 

3295
02:28:32,901 --> 02:28:34,730
snow and you're like,
oh Jesus.

3296
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:36,110
Like you're in a car,
a drive,

3297
02:28:36,111 --> 02:28:36,944
a downhill,
and the smells like you kinda can hit 

3298
02:28:37,911 --> 02:28:39,410
the brakes,
but are they really going to work?

3299
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:42,500
You're ahead of yourself.
You don't have full control.

3300
02:28:42,590 --> 02:28:43,423
And I think as a human species,
that's the currently the state we're at 

3301
02:28:45,950 --> 02:28:47,660
where,
where people were trying to force things

3302
02:28:47,661 --> 02:28:48,494
down people and we're trying to force 
change and change normally takes a long 

3303
02:28:52,131 --> 02:28:55,460
ass time to really settle in and it's 
happening so quick,

3304
02:28:55,610 --> 02:28:57,030
we can't really keep up with it.
Yeah,

3305
02:28:57,100 --> 02:28:59,240
that's the old rules.
So it's like,

3306
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:00,074
you know,
we didn't have the same way to 

3307
02:29:00,471 --> 02:29:01,304
communicate.
You can get an idea across the world 

3308
02:29:02,631 --> 02:29:04,680
instantly the same way.
Um,

3309
02:29:04,700 --> 02:29:05,533
so I think that people are reacting to 
that and they don't know how to really 

3310
02:29:07,310 --> 02:29:08,170
deal with it,
you know,

3311
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,043
they don't have to know how to share an 
idea with somebody that might not agree 

3312
02:29:11,301 --> 02:29:12,134
the same way,
but we do because you turn up yourself 

3313
02:29:13,001 --> 02:29:14,820
when you go to the supermarket,
whoever's,

3314
02:29:14,900 --> 02:29:16,370
you know,
I'm standing next to online,

3315
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:18,770
we get along,
we're cool no matter what.

3316
02:29:18,770 --> 02:29:20,300
Our backgrounds are,
what we believe.

3317
02:29:20,330 --> 02:29:21,710
We're just coexisting.
Yeah,

3318
02:29:21,711 --> 02:29:23,780
well that's like the shit I was saying 
before about chick flavors,

3319
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:24,653
other businesses,
well just I'm sure there's some guy who 

3320
02:29:25,821 --> 02:29:27,620
just believes shit that I find 
horrifying,

3321
02:29:27,621 --> 02:29:28,281
but I'm just like,
Hey,

3322
02:29:28,281 --> 02:29:29,490
let me get a water.
Let me get a dog.

3323
02:29:29,620 --> 02:29:31,250
It's like you don't even think about 
that shit,

3324
02:29:31,251 --> 02:29:31,671
and it's like,
yeah,

3325
02:29:31,671 --> 02:29:33,650
we all,
we do exist in this world.

3326
02:29:33,651 --> 02:29:35,960
We like come together and do all this 
shit all the time,

3327
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:36,973
but then you can kind of like pretend 
online that you have this like we're 

3328
02:29:40,821 --> 02:29:41,654
worlds apart and I would never do 
business with this problem is 

3329
02:29:44,511 --> 02:29:47,210
communicating online.
It's a shitty way of communicating.

3330
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:51,290
People shouldn't have conversations in 
front of each other where they look each

3331
02:29:51,291 --> 02:29:55,580
other and you can work through stuff,
podcast for real,

3332
02:29:55,980 --> 02:29:58,820
your harvest and write about it because 
you have an opportunity to be wrong.

3333
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:00,290
Find out why you're wrong,
think about it,

3334
02:30:00,291 --> 02:30:03,220
process it as opposed to editing your 
opinion down and going.

3335
02:30:03,230 --> 02:30:05,090
Here it is.
This is a very specific,

3336
02:30:05,091 --> 02:30:08,600
perfect version where it's not even 
really what your opinion is.

3337
02:30:08,601 --> 02:30:10,370
It's just how people are going to 
perceive it.

3338
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:12,260
It's a game you play in a word game.
Yes,

3339
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:13,123
the word games,
playing board sports in trying to when 

3340
02:30:14,930 --> 02:30:15,763
you know,
and this is a real problem with people 

3341
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:18,194
that aren't good at communicating one on
one because that's really the most 

3342
02:30:21,591 --> 02:30:24,170
valuable form of communication used to 
people in front of each other.

3343
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:25,004
You're like,
well I'm going to write you an email 

3344
02:30:25,731 --> 02:30:26,990
because I can't really talk to you about
this.

3345
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:27,913
And then you get this crazy email 
accusing you of all sorts of shit and 

3346
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:31,220
you know,
you're reading the tone.

3347
02:30:31,221 --> 02:30:32,630
Definitely.
You could call him up.

3348
02:30:32,631 --> 02:30:34,020
Hey Man,
what the fuck is this email?

3349
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:35,990
Like this is nonsense.
Like this shit didn't happen.

3350
02:30:35,991 --> 02:30:37,640
Then you get together and have a 
conversation about it.

3351
02:30:37,641 --> 02:30:40,580
Like let's talk person to person big 
Jay.

3352
02:30:40,940 --> 02:30:41,773
We just got into the thing one time.
I don't know what it was and we just as 

3353
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:45,260
we've been like fucking brothers for 
like,

3354
02:30:45,261 --> 02:30:47,000
you know,
a decade and a half almost,

3355
02:30:47,001 --> 02:30:48,350
right?
We're like real close friends.

3356
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:49,593
We've got to a thing where I just wrote 
him a long email so I'm going to write 

3357
02:30:51,441 --> 02:30:54,530
it in form of an email and then he's 
taking the tone like very wrong,

3358
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:55,364
so then he writes me back and email kind
of shitty and now we're like in a 

3359
02:30:57,621 --> 02:30:58,454
fucking fight and the reality was it was
just trying to communicate like road 

3360
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:02,210
dates or something.
It was so stupid.

3361
02:31:02,211 --> 02:31:03,044
You're like one conversation away from 
getting the whole thing and just like 

3362
02:31:06,190 --> 02:31:07,640
text messages,
emails,

3363
02:31:07,641 --> 02:31:08,474
so much is left to interpretation and 
depending upon how you're receiving 

3364
02:31:11,301 --> 02:31:12,770
that,
if you're in a good mood,

3365
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:14,060
I guess he's just busy.

3366
02:31:14,070 --> 02:31:15,110
No big deal.
He's a good guy.

3367
02:31:15,111 --> 02:31:17,260
He'll get back to me.
Downplay.

3368
02:31:17,290 --> 02:31:18,770
So like this motherfucker,
it's always on,

3369
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:24,230
on,
always on your terms to man call you and

3370
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:29,400
you don't want to talk to me.
Don't talk to me.

3371
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:32,760
I'll be okay.
I don't want to hear this bitch ass shit

3372
02:31:32,761 --> 02:31:36,750
like people where people get angry if 
you're busy like oh my God,

3373
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:39,330
it's always on your terms.
Don't know I'm busy.

3374
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:41,610
And while you're saying it's on their 
terms,

3375
02:31:41,611 --> 02:31:43,980
so much of that has to do with like your
fucking lie,

3376
02:31:44,010 --> 02:31:44,843
like if you're in a fight with your 
chick and you don't have the job you 

3377
02:31:46,561 --> 02:31:48,760
want to have and you know,
and then some guy doesn't return your.

3378
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:50,220
It's like,
fuck him,

3379
02:31:50,221 --> 02:31:51,240
man,
he's doing this.

3380
02:31:51,241 --> 02:31:53,280
But if everything's going good,
you see what I was like,

3381
02:31:53,390 --> 02:31:55,740
oh,
he's probably on that back country hike.

3382
02:31:55,740 --> 02:31:58,120
But I really appreciate you getting into
cell phone service.

3383
02:31:58,810 --> 02:31:59,643
I need to work out the stuff with 
Michelle and she's fucking freaked me 

3384
02:32:01,681 --> 02:32:02,140
out.
I'm a,

3385
02:32:02,140 --> 02:32:05,090
it might be a bro.
I hope you were there when I do that.

3386
02:32:05,091 --> 02:32:05,924
You Bro.
And you weren't people on the phone 

3387
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:10,400
anymore either.
I called.

3388
02:32:10,520 --> 02:32:12,180
I'm a color.
I have fat thumbs.

3389
02:32:12,181 --> 02:32:13,110
I fuck it.
If I text you,

3390
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:14,550
I'm angry.
I'm going to start.

3391
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:15,593
I'm going to end a friendship with you 
because it be so frustrated with my fat 

3392
02:32:17,311 --> 02:32:18,040
thumbs,
texting,

3393
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:19,170
shittily.
I can't believe.

3394
02:32:19,171 --> 02:32:20,460
Lewis just called me a fag.
What?

3395
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:22,860
Texas weak.
It's weak.

3396
02:32:22,890 --> 02:32:24,180
It's just not a good.
It's good.

3397
02:32:24,250 --> 02:32:25,051
Like,
Hey,

3398
02:32:25,051 --> 02:32:25,884
here's the address.
See tomorrow it's good for that kind of 

3399
02:32:27,541 --> 02:32:28,920
shit,
but that's all.

3400
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:30,000
That's all.
It's good for it.

3401
02:32:30,001 --> 02:32:30,834
It's not good for express.
I mean it's good for fun to say shitty 

3402
02:32:32,671 --> 02:32:33,330
things to each other.

3403
02:32:33,330 --> 02:32:36,780
If you know for a fact that you real 
good friends and yes,

3404
02:32:36,781 --> 02:32:38,760
you're right.
It's like twitter or something like that

3405
02:32:38,761 --> 02:32:39,990
is good for like,
you know,

3406
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:41,670
it's good for like,
Hey,

3407
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:44,880
if you want to check out something cool,
go to www.cool

3408
02:32:44,881 --> 02:32:46,580
stuff.com,
but it's not good for like,

3409
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:51,360
let me explain to you my take on 
taxation or worse,

3410
02:32:51,361 --> 02:32:54,570
your take on a person.
The thing about your take on a person,

3411
02:32:54,571 --> 02:32:55,440
it's you,
you're allowed to have.

3412
02:32:55,441 --> 02:32:58,420
You're obviously you like to say some 
politician or what have you.

3413
02:32:58,540 --> 02:33:00,540
You are absolutely related to have your 
opinion on them,

3414
02:33:00,990 --> 02:33:05,990
but you're not really talking to them.
Like if you really do know them,

3415
02:33:06,340 --> 02:33:07,173
we just sit like there's always a 
limitation if looking at someone from 

3416
02:33:09,901 --> 02:33:10,734
afar.
Right?

3417
02:33:11,130 --> 02:33:15,090
And if you could sit down in front of 
someone,

3418
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:17,070
some politician that you agree with or 
disagree with,

3419
02:33:17,071 --> 02:33:17,904
and then have a conversation with them,
then you would find out who the fuck 

3420
02:33:21,181 --> 02:33:21,870
they really are.

3421
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:22,703
Then you'd find out who the fuck you 
really are in respect to this argument 

3422
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:26,490
and that makes sense.
But you can't do that.

3423
02:33:26,690 --> 02:33:28,320
There's not enough people.
There's no way.

3424
02:33:28,530 --> 02:33:29,363
There's no way that everybody who has an
idea about anybody else can be with 

3425
02:33:32,161 --> 02:33:35,910
them.
But we have to respect that gap.

3426
02:33:36,150 --> 02:33:39,000
Like if you like sports guys are the 
worst at it,

3427
02:33:39,030 --> 02:33:39,863
the worst when they talk about a certain
player being lazy or certain fighter 

3428
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:44,990
being a pussy.
Like what in?

3429
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:50,270
What are you going on about?
You're talking about a professional cage

3430
02:33:50,611 --> 02:33:54,540
fighter and you're calling him a pussy.
But I've read that shit all day.

3431
02:33:54,670 --> 02:33:55,503
Read it all the time.
And it's that thing where you would 

3432
02:33:57,721 --> 02:33:59,730
never say that if you were in front of 
them,

3433
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:01,260
you would never say that in front of 
them.

3434
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:03,720
I weirdly think that like as a fan,
you sorta,

3435
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:06,930
you're buying the right to express that 
opinion.

3436
02:34:06,931 --> 02:34:09,060
In a weird way though,
not that they're a pussy,

3437
02:34:09,390 --> 02:34:10,223
but like,
like when people get mad at people 

3438
02:34:11,941 --> 02:34:13,710
booing at UFC events,
I'm going like,

3439
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:16,050
I don't know,
they're kind of buying that experience,

3440
02:34:16,051 --> 02:34:18,040
you know,
and I can't hate on them if

3441
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,560
they want to express themselves that 
way.

3442
02:34:20,900 --> 02:34:22,040
Um,
you know,

3443
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:23,710
it's sort of sort of a thing.
I mean,

3444
02:34:23,711 --> 02:34:23,951
look,
I,

3445
02:34:23,951 --> 02:34:27,970
I got very humbled doing the podcast 
with Michael bisping because I was doing

3446
02:34:27,971 --> 02:34:30,550
radio on Sirius Xm for awhile and 
talking about mma,

3447
02:34:30,551 --> 02:34:33,110
like I fucking knew anything and they're
starting to show bisque bake.

3448
02:34:33,160 --> 02:34:33,731
And then I was like,
oh,

3449
02:34:33,731 --> 02:34:34,511
I don't know,
Shit.

3450
02:34:34,511 --> 02:34:36,040
I'm not even going to pretend like I 
know shit.

3451
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:37,990
And um,
it's so much better at it now.

3452
02:34:37,991 --> 02:34:40,990
I'm not trying to fit into this fucking 
like mold or,

3453
02:34:40,991 --> 02:34:42,970
or whatever.
But yeah,

3454
02:34:42,971 --> 02:34:46,840
I think that from a fan's perspective,
I don't really get mad at them when they

3455
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:49,300
start talking shit or start to like,
it's kind of like,

3456
02:34:49,410 --> 02:34:50,680
it's part of the experience,
you know?

3457
02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:52,271
Yeah.
No,

3458
02:34:52,271 --> 02:34:54,490
I mean I get it,
but you shouldn't,

3459
02:34:54,580 --> 02:34:58,000
shouldn't be disrespectful to people for
no reason like that.

3460
02:34:58,030 --> 02:34:58,863
Like there's,
there's a lot of guys that get into it 

3461
02:34:59,681 --> 02:35:02,950
just because it's like they feel like 
they're behind a wall and they could lob

3462
02:35:02,951 --> 02:35:04,720
bombs.
It's a pussy move.

3463
02:35:04,870 --> 02:35:05,980
It's a weird.
It's not,

3464
02:35:05,981 --> 02:35:06,814
it's not healthy for me going,
it's like if you go to an event and 

3465
02:35:09,881 --> 02:35:10,714
there's two guys getting in a cage,
fucking fighting to start booing them 

3466
02:35:14,201 --> 02:35:15,370
just seems to me.
It's like,

3467
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:16,390
dude,
I mean,

3468
02:35:16,391 --> 02:35:17,224
come on man,
they're fucking to entertain you guys 

3469
02:35:19,301 --> 02:35:21,820
getting in there and,
and putting it all on the line.

3470
02:35:21,821 --> 02:35:22,654
Like yeah,
they have a right to know I would never 

3471
02:35:25,061 --> 02:35:25,894
in a million years,
but at the same time I kind of 

3472
02:35:26,861 --> 02:35:28,180
understand it.
It's almost like,

3473
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:30,250
well they should be able to build your 
comedy shows to then.

3474
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:31,510
Yeah,
but I'll tell you,

3475
02:35:31,630 --> 02:35:33,460
I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you why not?

3476
02:35:33,490 --> 02:35:37,000
Because they're not.
I don't believe that at a comedy show,

3477
02:35:37,001 --> 02:35:37,834
if they're booing you during your set,
they're completely taking out the 

3478
02:35:40,301 --> 02:35:43,300
experience for everybody else and I feel
like it'll a live sporting event.

3479
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:44,710
It's just not the same thing.
They're not,

3480
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:46,000
they're not getting into the fighters 
had.

3481
02:35:46,001 --> 02:35:47,230
I mean,
maybe they are a little bit,

3482
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:49,480
but you know,
I talked to Mike about this.

3483
02:35:50,080 --> 02:35:51,220
He says,
people booed me.

3484
02:35:51,221 --> 02:35:52,054
They fucking love my fault.
He's a different type of person that is 

3485
02:35:54,290 --> 02:35:55,123
wearing champion.
He's got a different kind of mental 

3486
02:35:56,561 --> 02:35:57,810
strength.
He can you.

3487
02:35:57,850 --> 02:36:00,940
He doesn't give a fuck.
I can plow through everything and that's

3488
02:36:00,941 --> 02:36:02,470
why I became a champion.
I mean,

3489
02:36:02,471 --> 02:36:06,130
he's like one of the most mentally 
strong guys to ever fight in mma because

3490
02:36:06,131 --> 02:36:08,380
he's a god that when he started out,
he was good.

3491
02:36:08,381 --> 02:36:09,214
He was very good.
He won the ultimate fighter season two 

3492
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:12,503
and was a good fighter,
but willed himself in the position of 

3493
02:36:15,971 --> 02:36:19,180
being a champion and was knocked out,
was stopped,

3494
02:36:19,181 --> 02:36:21,670
was beaten,
had his momentum stopped,

3495
02:36:21,700 --> 02:36:26,700
restart it right back up again with the 
same or better enthusiasm every time and

3496
02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:28,000
deep into his thirties.

3497
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,100
Did it all clean.
No steroids,

3498
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:32,110
no allegations,
no bullshit.

3499
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:36,190
Just worked hard and was tough as fuck 
and won the fucking middleweight title.

3500
02:36:36,290 --> 02:36:37,840
It's a different type of mind,
dude.

3501
02:36:37,841 --> 02:36:38,591
I know,
I know.

3502
02:36:38,591 --> 02:36:39,424
He lost two in a row,
but the fact that he went out there and 

3503
02:36:41,921 --> 02:36:42,754
had a fight that I thought he was going 
to win until GSP called him with that 

3504
02:36:45,761 --> 02:36:46,700
left,
I thought he was gonna,

3505
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:47,553
win the fight and then loses the GSP for
the title and the biggest middleweight 

3506
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:53,560
fight probably ever and then just goes,
I want fight Kevin Gas,

3507
02:36:53,561 --> 02:36:57,930
lemon to week Kelvin.
Kelvin so cheese us,

3508
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:58,650
man.
You.

3509
02:36:58,650 --> 02:37:02,230
Yeah.
He's such a fucking straight up ass dude

3510
02:37:02,231 --> 02:37:03,310
logic.
He's like,

3511
02:37:03,311 --> 02:37:04,144
it was like,
yeah,

3512
02:37:04,380 --> 02:37:06,610
I already did a training camp.
Why not get two paychecks?

3513
02:37:07,910 --> 02:37:10,090
It was a rough fight though.
I don't think it was a smart,

3514
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:12,330
smarter than.
I agree with you on that.

3515
02:37:12,490 --> 02:37:15,040
Still up that George George,
St Pierre,

3516
02:37:15,420 --> 02:37:16,160
you know,
he took

3517
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:19,190
four years off and everything like that,
but he's still one of the greatest,

3518
02:37:19,191 --> 02:37:22,250
if not the greatest of all time.
And you saw that in that fight?

3519
02:37:22,251 --> 02:37:23,420
Yeah,
I don't think he was.

3520
02:37:23,450 --> 02:37:26,750
I mean Michael cut them.
He caught him with those elbows,

3521
02:37:26,751 --> 02:37:30,050
particularly from the bottom.
But you know George St Pierre is,

3522
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:32,900
he's a special guy.
He really is a special athlete.

3523
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:35,750
People were really underestimating how 
great George St Pierre was.

3524
02:37:35,751 --> 02:37:38,420
He's the guy who beat every person that 
was ever put in front of them.

3525
02:37:38,421 --> 02:37:41,050
The losses that he had avenged.
So butte,

3526
02:37:41,080 --> 02:37:45,330
dominantly George Saint Pierre is a 
monster and you know,

3527
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:47,360
I think that everyone,
including myself,

3528
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:48,223
you know,
really didn't think he was going to be 

3529
02:37:48,951 --> 02:37:49,784
able to come back with that long of a 
layoff and compete the way that you set 

3530
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:54,163
yourself.
Mike was just mentally push himself for 

3531
02:37:55,311 --> 02:37:56,144
getting better and better.
Michael bisping today destroys Michael 

3532
02:37:58,970 --> 02:38:01,070
Bisping a younger Michael bisping seven 
years ago.

3533
02:38:01,190 --> 02:38:02,690
That's crazy.
He's an old man now.

3534
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:05,030
Maybe it's entirely possible.
I mean,

3535
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:09,350
the fighting is such a crazy proposition
that even with like elite guys,

3536
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:13,130
like even when someone won a fight,
like if you make them fight again,

3537
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:15,440
would they win 100 percent of the time?
But I don't think they would.

3538
02:38:15,470 --> 02:38:16,440
Not at all.
No.

3539
02:38:16,450 --> 02:38:19,910
So there's things in weird events that 
can change your fortunate a fight.

3540
02:38:19,940 --> 02:38:21,460
I said,
Steve,

3541
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:22,343
I think if in Ghana,
in Ghana could beat him a few times if 

3542
02:38:24,111 --> 02:38:27,140
they fought 10 times,
he could not come out 10 times steep.

3543
02:38:27,150 --> 02:38:27,983
A definitely doesn't win all.
Ten is definitely a few that haven't 

3544
02:38:30,500 --> 02:38:33,740
gone for sure.
If they have a rematch,

3545
02:38:34,160 --> 02:38:34,993
see the thing about like what would you 
have to restart it with a time machine 

3546
02:38:38,391 --> 02:38:39,224
where there's no memory whatsoever by 
experiencing each other because you 

3547
02:38:42,401 --> 02:38:43,040
know,
you get,

3548
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:44,390
you understand patterns.

3549
02:38:44,390 --> 02:38:46,910
That's why it's weird when you see guys 
fight training partners.

3550
02:38:47,330 --> 02:38:51,410
It's like there's guys that just know 
each other so well that when they get in

3551
02:38:51,411 --> 02:38:53,360
there they've already got established a 
pattern.

3552
02:38:53,361 --> 02:38:54,194
One guy's always bullied.
The other guy in training one guys beat 

3553
02:38:56,061 --> 02:38:57,980
the other guy up and you could see it 
when they actually fight.

3554
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:00,070
Yeah.
Well actually,

3555
02:39:00,290 --> 02:39:01,970
and the other thing,
just as we're saying this,

3556
02:39:01,971 --> 02:39:02,600
I go,
yeah,

3557
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:05,540
George St Pierre was the greatest ever I
had to make a case for.

3558
02:39:05,630 --> 02:39:06,463
If you have to make a case,
I don't think there's a stronger case 

3559
02:39:08,061 --> 02:39:08,894
for anyone.
Then for George sounds crazy coming 

3560
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:10,901
back.
He,

3561
02:39:10,901 --> 02:39:12,350
yes,
he beat everyone.

3562
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:13,193
Whoever he ever faced,
he had two losses that were Matt Hughes 

3563
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:21,760
and Matt Serra Right and came back and 
destroyed them in the rematches Matt,

3564
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:22,933
Matt Hughes twice,
and Matt Serra just came back and beat 

3565
02:39:24,971 --> 02:39:26,600
him in the third rubber match.

3566
02:39:26,600 --> 02:39:29,660
Never happened.
Then after retiring,

3567
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:32,480
comes back and wins the championship.
A division up,

3568
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:33,373
not just that,
but Michael Bisping and chokes him 

3569
02:39:36,141 --> 02:39:39,590
unconscious with a rear naked choke.
That was one of the tightest,

3570
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:43,340
most cinched up rear naked choke I've 
ever seen anybody perform ever.

3571
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:45,710
I mean he,
he had it like a Jujitsu guy,

3572
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:46,873
like a lot of MMA guys.
They have a harder time getting those 

3573
02:39:48,651 --> 02:39:49,484
gloves fully locked into position.
Like there's a difference between 

3574
02:39:52,700 --> 02:39:53,533
there's this,
there's an a rear naked choke with the 

3575
02:39:55,881 --> 02:39:56,714
palm is touching the back of the head,
which a lot of people opt for because 

3576
02:39:58,881 --> 02:40:00,530
you don't have to make as much space for
the arm.

3577
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:02,660
You can get back there,
you can grab that head,

3578
02:40:02,661 --> 02:40:03,494
but the real way to do it as like this,
the real way to do it as a karate chop 

3579
02:40:06,621 --> 02:40:07,454
where you go to the back of the neck 
with the karate chop and once you have 

3580
02:40:10,101 --> 02:40:10,934
that in place,
then there's this crazy leverage and it 

3581
02:40:13,741 --> 02:40:13,980
just

3582
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,813
squeezes the fuck out of someone's neck 
on someone really gets one of those 

3583
02:40:18,181 --> 02:40:19,014
locked in and that's what George did.
And the way he did it was like as tight 

3584
02:40:23,010 --> 02:40:26,940
and sweet and four star black belt 
level,

3585
02:40:26,941 --> 02:40:30,990
rear naked choke the you ever seen the 
God damn it.

3586
02:40:30,991 --> 02:40:33,320
It's hard to listen to you describe.
It's a beautiful.

3587
02:40:34,580 --> 02:40:35,413
That's another thing didn't.
I never gave a shit at all the same way 

3588
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:39,743
like me and Michael [inaudible] at this 
point to become friends to where it's 

3589
02:40:41,851 --> 02:40:44,340
like you start to fucking care about 
these guys.

3590
02:40:44,600 --> 02:40:47,670
If you imagine being a family member,
you imagine having somebody that you,

3591
02:40:47,671 --> 02:40:48,870
like,
your blood is in there.

3592
02:40:49,290 --> 02:40:50,123
Um,
you know,

3593
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:53,790
being a fan of somebody is one thing,
but then you know somebody and that,

3594
02:40:53,990 --> 02:40:55,440
that was,
that was hard to watch.

3595
02:40:55,470 --> 02:40:56,303
Shops,
one of my best friends and I had to do 

3596
02:40:57,061 --> 02:40:59,970
commentary on some of his fights because
it was a real hard time.

3597
02:41:00,070 --> 02:41:00,903
It real hard.
Last couple of fights in particular was 

3598
02:41:02,431 --> 02:41:03,264
very hard for me.
Very hard to to like I have to be as 

3599
02:41:06,871 --> 02:41:07,704
equally enthusiastic about him getting 
hit as I am about him hitting somebody 

3600
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:11,633
and I know the guy very well.
Show us their shirt mass shooting for 

3601
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:15,174
sure.
I even said like everybody knew that I 

3602
02:41:16,231 --> 02:41:18,210
was really good friends with them.
It was a,

3603
02:41:18,230 --> 02:41:19,063
you know,
we had done a bunch of podcasts 

3604
02:41:19,561 --> 02:41:20,394
together,
but I was also the guy who talked him 

3605
02:41:21,411 --> 02:41:22,890
into retiring because I was like,
look,

3606
02:41:22,891 --> 02:41:24,700
I know what's going on.
Like you know,

3607
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:25,553
I've seen this with other people and I'm
not friends with them and it's not my 

3608
02:41:27,541 --> 02:41:30,180
position to tell people to stop and I 
don't know them that well.

3609
02:41:30,181 --> 02:41:32,400
You'd have to know someone real well to 
know where their head's at,

3610
02:41:32,790 --> 02:41:33,623
you know,
but that's a sport where proof see like 

3611
02:41:37,261 --> 02:41:39,570
if you're billing a basketball game,
maybe.

3612
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:40,403
I guess I guess like there's something 
that's so much more intense about a 

3613
02:41:44,311 --> 02:41:46,920
fight,
especially like there's smart blues,

3614
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:47,754
like when someone does something illegal
or someone does something or someone 

3615
02:41:53,791 --> 02:41:56,280
does something that's fucked up,
there's smart boost,

3616
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,293
but then there's booze where guys were 
facing each other and they're canceling 

3617
02:41:59,911 --> 02:42:03,990
each other out like you're watching a 
really high level thing,

3618
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:06,330
what these guys are trying to solve,
what do,

3619
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:07,183
what do I have to do to connect on this 
guy's fucking brainstem and knock his 

3620
02:42:10,501 --> 02:42:11,334
lights out,
but the UFC is marketing toward these 

3621
02:42:13,501 --> 02:42:14,334
casual fans who are basketball fans and 
football fans who aren't really the 

3622
02:42:16,651 --> 02:42:19,860
people who are hardcore who appreciate 
the martial arts side of it.

3623
02:42:19,861 --> 02:42:21,900
What these guys are putting into it.
You think so?

3624
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:22,943
I think they're just marketing.
I don't think they're marketing towards 

3625
02:42:24,721 --> 02:42:26,730
any specific fan.
They're not marketing towards.

3626
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:27,563
People don't understand that,
but I think that's the almost the same 

3627
02:42:29,971 --> 02:42:30,804
thing because they're just trying to get
a mass audience and the majority of 

3628
02:42:32,641 --> 02:42:34,430
people aren't.
People who really understand.

3629
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:36,910
What makes you say that though?
What makes you say they're trying?

3630
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:39,410
Like what are they doing specifically?
Um,

3631
02:42:39,750 --> 02:42:41,980
I feel like when they put together,
you know,

3632
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:42,863
fights that don't necessarily make sense
in terms of rankings when they put the 

3633
02:42:45,510 --> 02:42:46,343
interim belts on,
flights were don't really need to be 

3634
02:42:48,031 --> 02:42:49,290
there.
You just know it's a marketing move.

3635
02:42:49,300 --> 02:42:53,220
Because I think a title on a poster,
we'll probably sell that many tickets.

3636
02:42:53,221 --> 02:42:54,870
Good point.
It definitely juices it up.

3637
02:42:54,900 --> 02:42:57,540
When you have an interim title,
something like a marketing dude.

3638
02:42:57,541 --> 02:42:58,171
It's going like,
oh yeah,

3639
02:42:58,171 --> 02:42:59,004
we saw this many more paper version 
because the title and you know the 

3640
02:43:01,531 --> 02:43:03,360
difference between the interim title or 
a regular title.

3641
02:43:03,360 --> 02:43:04,193
A lot of the casuals don't know the 
difference between Michael Bisbing or 

3642
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:07,400
fucking doors Api.
Look,

3643
02:43:07,401 --> 02:43:08,234
I'm with your set of bar.
I almost feel conflicted because I have 

3644
02:43:10,651 --> 02:43:12,640
this part me that's like a purist that's
like,

3645
02:43:12,641 --> 02:43:13,474
no,
it should be just like whoever number 

3646
02:43:14,171 --> 02:43:18,190
one is versus the champion and we should
never fuck around that same time.

3647
02:43:18,250 --> 02:43:19,210
If they were just like,
oh,

3648
02:43:19,211 --> 02:43:20,044
you know what,
we just set up Nick Diaz versus conor 

3649
02:43:21,161 --> 02:43:22,000
Mcgregor.
I'd be like,

3650
02:43:22,001 --> 02:43:24,700
that's the greatest thing that's ever 
happened and I don't care.

3651
02:43:24,850 --> 02:43:25,683
I don't care.
I don't care if Khabib's one slash 72 

3652
02:43:28,481 --> 02:43:29,314
fights in a row.
Camp Bucca I'm flying a 100 out of 100 

3653
02:43:34,181 --> 02:43:35,014
times.
I don't give a fuck where he's fighting 

3654
02:43:35,501 --> 02:43:37,420
who he's fighting.
It's just fun and it's exciting,

3655
02:43:37,421 --> 02:43:38,254
but let's get real.
I think there was something really pure 

3656
02:43:40,391 --> 02:43:41,224
and what's beautiful about mma is that 
it's always going to kind of figure 

3657
02:43:44,081 --> 02:43:44,650
itself out.

3658
02:43:44,650 --> 02:43:46,300
It is the greatest sport because it's 
the greatest sport.

3659
02:43:46,301 --> 02:43:49,330
Anything can happen any given Sunday.
It's inherently built.

3660
02:43:49,360 --> 02:43:51,100
The marketing is sort of built in 
already,

3661
02:43:51,101 --> 02:43:52,060
right?
So you can,

3662
02:43:52,210 --> 02:43:53,043
you can create a pecking order,
you can create rankings and I think you 

3663
02:43:55,061 --> 02:43:56,170
can kind of just say,
hey,

3664
02:43:56,171 --> 02:43:57,004
the pieces are gonna fall where they're 
going to fall and it's always going to 

3665
02:43:58,441 --> 02:44:02,620
be super exciting and you see what the 
way they handle connor or certain guys,

3666
02:44:02,950 --> 02:44:03,783
they definitely,
they threw that to the side and I think 

3667
02:44:05,891 --> 02:44:07,450
conor is a great example of it as well.
Why?

3668
02:44:07,451 --> 02:44:08,520
They don't really care.
They're like,

3669
02:44:08,521 --> 02:44:09,011
all right,
fuck it,

3670
02:44:09,011 --> 02:44:09,844
dude.
Go Do may whether they had it for a 

3671
02:44:11,621 --> 02:44:13,360
little while because they were part of 
the promotion.

3672
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:16,030
Yeah.
Hundreds of millions of dollars off that

3673
02:44:16,031 --> 02:44:18,550
thing.
Everybody made a fuck load of money.

3674
02:44:18,840 --> 02:44:21,340
I mean may,
whether made hundreds of millions.

3675
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:22,690
Connor made $100,
million.

3676
02:44:22,691 --> 02:44:23,524
I don't know what the UFC made.
Everybody got fucking crazy paid and 

3677
02:44:27,011 --> 02:44:27,844
then they started zoo for boxing and now
there are other offering a Joshua and 

3678
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:33,900
Joshua.
You're offering 100 million.

3679
02:44:33,901 --> 02:44:36,040
I'm crazy contract.
Apparently that might people.

3680
02:44:36,041 --> 02:44:36,890
Shit,
I don't know.

3681
02:44:36,891 --> 02:44:39,820
I haven't asked anybody if that's real,
but I'm not surprised.

3682
02:44:39,850 --> 02:44:41,740
They realize there's a lot of money and 
promoting fights,

3683
02:44:41,741 --> 02:44:45,700
whether it's promoting mma.
Dana has a big background in boxing.

3684
02:44:45,810 --> 02:44:47,350
You know?
His son actually just had a,

3685
02:44:47,420 --> 02:44:49,900
an amateur boxing fight.
I saw that and it's instagram.

3686
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:52,960
Fuck.
Dana loves boxing,

3687
02:44:52,980 --> 02:44:56,140
so I always loved it so it's not unusual
that they decided to go into it,

3688
02:44:56,530 --> 02:44:59,470
but with connor was like one of those 
things where you're like,

3689
02:44:59,471 --> 02:45:00,890
yeah,
that's what you're supposed to do.

3690
02:45:00,891 --> 02:45:01,724
If may with a really wants to fight 
conor and college never had a 

3691
02:45:03,461 --> 02:45:04,200
professional fighting.

3692
02:45:04,200 --> 02:45:06,280
You make 100 million bucks.
Let's see,

3693
02:45:06,640 --> 02:45:07,990
let's see,
let's see who buys it,

3694
02:45:07,991 --> 02:45:11,440
but I'm just saying that the MMA purists
were what's best for the sport of MMA.

3695
02:45:11,441 --> 02:45:13,560
That's not necessarily the best move and
oh,

3696
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:14,403
it's not bad move.
It doesn't hurt it at all because first 

3697
02:45:16,331 --> 02:45:17,164
of all it shows you that in the 
specialties that there are people that 

3698
02:45:20,801 --> 02:45:21,634
have skills and techniques and abilities
that far exceed the very best mma 

3699
02:45:25,001 --> 02:45:27,100
fighters and you saw that with conor and
floyd.

3700
02:45:27,101 --> 02:45:29,560
Floyd just fucked him up.
Just fucked him up.

3701
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:30,513
But Connor caught them a little bit and 
he tagged him in the beginning and you 

3702
02:45:33,311 --> 02:45:36,910
can say that floyd wasn't going full 
tilt and he probably wasn't.

3703
02:45:36,930 --> 02:45:39,970
I would say definitely wasn't.
He was definitely trying to wear him out

3704
02:45:39,971 --> 02:45:40,804
and get him tired because he knew that 
he relied on kinetic energy for the 

3705
02:45:42,701 --> 02:45:44,950
first round or two,
but you still got clipped with a shot.

3706
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:46,420
He did want to get clipped with.
Sure.

3707
02:45:46,760 --> 02:45:47,593
I think floyd wanted to see what connor 
was doing and he spent the first few 

3708
02:45:50,711 --> 02:45:51,544
rounds,
like kind of taking in data and like 

3709
02:45:53,050 --> 02:45:53,651
seeing like,
okay,

3710
02:45:53,651 --> 02:45:55,600
what are you doing here?
What Weird Shit are you trying?

3711
02:45:55,780 --> 02:45:56,613
But still I was like,
I did not think connor was going to do 

3712
02:45:59,381 --> 02:46:00,214
that good teaching.
I thought it would be over within three 

3713
02:46:02,291 --> 02:46:03,124
or four rounds and made whether it would
knock him out and he would just 

3714
02:46:04,720 --> 02:46:08,500
outclassed him in the fact that it went 
10 and then even landed some shots.

3715
02:46:08,501 --> 02:46:10,430
I was pretty impressed.
Fight itself.

3716
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:11,263
That's like,
it's not bad for as a purist I'm saying 

3717
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:17,681
it's almost like it's the way they're 
sort of letting connor run the show.

3718
02:46:19,190 --> 02:46:23,750
I just Kinda feel like the UFC sort of 
always built this brand UFC,

3719
02:46:23,751 --> 02:46:24,131
it's,
you know,

3720
02:46:24,131 --> 02:46:29,131
it's a coca cola of MMA and I feel like 
connor has basically become bigger or at

3721
02:46:30,381 --> 02:46:33,400
the very least as big as the UFC and he 
doesn't do,

3722
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,210
he doesn't give a shit tweet.
He tweeted out the other day,

3723
02:46:35,211 --> 02:46:37,160
I'm the boss when he was promoting the 
video game,

3724
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:40,160
like they did a diploma with Dana White 
is one of the characters,

3725
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:42,073
but I just feel like that wasn't 
necessarily the best thing for mixed 

3726
02:46:45,561 --> 02:46:47,960
martial arts as a sport.
I almost feel like what they were doing,

3727
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,370
which doesn't hurt at all.
Yeah,

3728
02:46:49,371 --> 02:46:50,204
maybe,
maybe not.

3729
02:46:50,330 --> 02:46:52,070
I think it made it bigger.
I mean it's like,

3730
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:52,993
dude,
what connor created was like a thing 

3731
02:46:54,771 --> 02:46:57,500
that's like really hard to.

3732
02:46:57,530 --> 02:46:58,363
Even when he,
when he fought a marcus bridge as his 

3733
02:47:00,351 --> 02:47:01,184
first fight in the UFC and I remember 
already there was like an energy in the 

3734
02:47:04,041 --> 02:47:08,600
crowd about connor fighting.
She to know who this guy was angry,

3735
02:47:08,601 --> 02:47:09,434
like why is this such a big thing?
And that every fight was just a bigger 

3736
02:47:12,141 --> 02:47:14,990
and bigger and bigger thing.
And then we create this thing where like

3737
02:47:15,170 --> 02:47:16,003
Dustin [inaudible] biggest fight ever is
against conor mcgregor and Dustin had 

3738
02:47:19,370 --> 02:47:20,203
way more big fights than him,
but still the big deal was that you're 

3739
02:47:22,731 --> 02:47:23,930
fighting this guy.
Like he just,

3740
02:47:24,050 --> 02:47:27,080
he would create these stages.
Just that it was the results.

3741
02:47:27,081 --> 02:47:27,914
Like you put moccasins for him and he 
starts dust employee in the first round 

3742
02:47:31,351 --> 02:47:35,750
he slept Josie Aldo in 13 seconds.
Swayze was all real accomplishments.

3743
02:47:36,250 --> 02:47:38,450
Why him fighting?
Floyd Mayweather.

3744
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:41,720
It was interesting because he was so 
exceptional as a striker.

3745
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:43,080
But do you think that uh,
uh,

3746
02:47:43,220 --> 02:47:43,770
this.
I,

3747
02:47:43,770 --> 02:47:47,720
I give the UFC so much credit with 
building conor conor mcgregor because he

3748
02:47:47,721 --> 02:47:49,220
wouldn't have been able to do that 
anywhere else.

3749
02:47:49,221 --> 02:47:50,054
Like the UFC is such a big brand that he
couldn't have been a war fighter and 

3750
02:47:53,271 --> 02:47:54,550
become a,
you know,

3751
02:47:54,551 --> 02:47:55,384
a worldwide name the way he is now,
probably not in bits which is weird to 

3752
02:47:58,911 --> 02:48:01,960
bell towards a stupid name.
They need to accept facts.

3753
02:48:07,240 --> 02:48:08,990
Thought about that until you just said 
that.

3754
02:48:08,991 --> 02:48:09,824
I wouldn't let him make an sucks balls.
The regency box say it's time for 

3755
02:48:14,841 --> 02:48:18,380
regency boxing on HBO.
What is this nonsense?

3756
02:48:18,620 --> 02:48:23,620
Why would you call a regency boxing mma?
Just call it mma.

3757
02:48:24,230 --> 02:48:25,130
MMA.
That's what it is.

3758
02:48:25,131 --> 02:48:28,560
Just like when you watch Hbo Boxing,
it's on Hbo and it's boxing.

3759
02:48:28,910 --> 02:48:29,743
Think good that the UFC is sort of built
this brand around it because I think 

3760
02:48:32,171 --> 02:48:34,730
it's,
but for the sport in itself,

3761
02:48:34,731 --> 02:48:36,140
because in boxing even,
you know,

3762
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:39,700
you don't really know the difference 
between any of the title or the,

3763
02:48:39,701 --> 02:48:41,200
uh,
the organizations or the titles.

3764
02:48:41,210 --> 02:48:41,750
You don't really.
I don't know.

3765
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:42,890
The WBC,
the W.

3766
02:48:42,891 --> 02:48:43,724
I don't know.
Even fans don't really know the 

3767
02:48:46,251 --> 02:48:47,190
difference.
Well,

3768
02:48:47,210 --> 02:48:49,250
they know who the big guys are.
They know Anthony.

3769
02:48:49,251 --> 02:48:51,260
Joshua,
they know as Klitschko forever.

3770
02:48:51,510 --> 02:48:52,343
You know,
everybody knows about deontay wilder 

3771
02:48:53,271 --> 02:48:54,480
now.
So there's a few guy,

3772
02:48:54,500 --> 02:48:56,140
but there's a couple of other champions 
that are out there.

3773
02:48:56,141 --> 02:48:56,510
They,
they're like,

3774
02:48:56,510 --> 02:48:57,720
who?
Who's this guy?

3775
02:48:58,900 --> 02:49:03,050
The guy you've never heard of has like 
six belts on his championship chapters,

3776
02:49:03,140 --> 02:49:05,330
intercontinental championships.
Everybody gets belts.

3777
02:49:05,331 --> 02:49:08,040
It's like ugly boxing titles that 
fucking

3778
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:08,903
big old.
The UFC nailed it with that belt belt 

3779
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:15,690
champion belt connor had two of them.
He goes with my other fucking belt.

3780
02:49:16,200 --> 02:49:19,730
I want to be the champ champ.
And he's got his arms look,

3781
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:20,573
man,
it's,

3782
02:49:20,910 --> 02:49:22,830
it's,
there's no sport like it.

3783
02:49:22,980 --> 02:49:23,813
There's nothing like it.
Nothing is going to hurt it as long as 

3784
02:49:25,171 --> 02:49:28,620
it's as long as people are interested,
like as long as people enjoy it.

3785
02:49:28,621 --> 02:49:29,454
As much as I enjoy it,
as much as I enjoy watching it so much 

3786
02:49:31,981 --> 02:49:34,210
as I enjoyed calling it,
as long as that's going to be the case,

3787
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:35,870
there's always going to be kids coming 
up like this.

3788
02:49:35,871 --> 02:49:38,780
Sean o'malley kid,
that wild motherfucker kid,

3789
02:49:39,220 --> 02:49:42,240
we saw them on instagram.
It's just all him smoking weed.

3790
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:44,850
He's a fucking savage.
She's out there just doing bong hits,

3791
02:49:44,880 --> 02:49:46,680
kick people in the face,
don't Afro.

3792
02:49:46,770 --> 02:49:48,120
I love it.
I love that guy.

3793
02:49:48,330 --> 02:49:50,570
He's an animal and that fucking kid is 
like,

3794
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:52,620
this is this new breed.
There's this new guy.

3795
02:49:52,650 --> 02:49:54,510
They love it so much and when they're 
doing it,

3796
02:49:54,511 --> 02:49:55,344
they love it so much and they're so good
and they're going to be better the next 

3797
02:49:58,201 --> 02:50:00,450
generation that just going to keep 
getting better and better and better,

3798
02:50:00,451 --> 02:50:03,390
and that's what connor did as well as he
opened up that window because everyone's

3799
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:05,730
going to get paid a lot more money now 
that there's so much.

3800
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,550
You see people talking about hundreds of
millions of dollars at stake.

3801
02:50:08,850 --> 02:50:10,050
It's like everyone's gone,
Huh?

3802
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:11,250
Okay.
That's sugar.

3803
02:50:11,251 --> 02:50:12,084
Sean o'malley could be a fucking 
multimin multimillionaire and a couple 

3804
02:50:15,691 --> 02:50:16,524
of years I'm not bullshitting.
That kid could be huge and that's just 

3805
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:22,380
the CBD oil company.
He's a wild man.

3806
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,780
He's a fucking wild man too.
The way fights.

3807
02:50:24,781 --> 02:50:26,280
Was He gaming?
He's got one of them.

3808
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:29,130
Gaming chairs.
He's fucking hilarious,

3809
02:50:29,640 --> 02:50:31,250
but he's good man.
And He.

3810
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:33,900
The thing about him is he's like super 
creative.

3811
02:50:34,020 --> 02:50:34,853
What does that thing down that low go to
the lefthand side and scroll down to 

3812
02:50:37,161 --> 02:50:39,030
that video of him working out.
What is he doing there?

3813
02:50:39,850 --> 02:50:41,610
What is he doing here?
He does a lot of weird,

3814
02:50:41,611 --> 02:50:44,480
crazy shit like that.
Yeah,

3815
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:48,990
like he's practicing and he does that 
threesixty take down to the back control

3816
02:50:49,280 --> 02:50:51,840
like guess.
I mean he might not ever do that in real

3817
02:50:51,841 --> 02:50:53,250
life,
but he might hit that all the time.

3818
02:50:53,251 --> 02:50:55,080
So he does that high kick but leave the 
spin.

3819
02:50:55,230 --> 02:50:56,063
So that spans for the guard pass.
That's very confused because a lot of 

3820
02:50:58,531 --> 02:51:01,920
times guys dive straight in and guys who
are good,

3821
02:51:01,980 --> 02:51:04,770
especially the half guard wind up 
wrapping them up real quick,

3822
02:51:04,771 --> 02:51:06,210
but he does a spin around it.

3823
02:51:06,930 --> 02:51:09,630
I wonder if he gave me the way he hits 
that.

3824
02:51:09,631 --> 02:51:11,490
If he does that over and over and over 
again,

3825
02:51:11,491 --> 02:51:13,290
I bet he can do that in a fight.
Well,

3826
02:51:13,291 --> 02:51:16,170
that's a cool thing about now it's like,
can we watch it with like Anthony Pettis

3827
02:51:16,171 --> 02:51:18,170
was at first like holy fuck moment with 
the,

3828
02:51:18,180 --> 02:51:19,890
you know,
the less wgc event ever.

3829
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:20,621
Um,
the,

3830
02:51:20,621 --> 02:51:22,620
the,
the jumping kick or whatever,

3831
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,753
but you get guys that are so athletic 
now that and now there's so much money 

3832
02:51:25,891 --> 02:51:29,840
in the sport guys that might've went 
into like football or basketball.

3833
02:51:29,860 --> 02:51:33,990
Now we're looking at MMA as an option.
Whereas you kind of weren't getting that

3834
02:51:33,990 --> 02:51:35,400
years ago.
So there's super athletes.

3835
02:51:35,401 --> 02:51:36,234
Think about that dude.
How dangerous are these guys going to 

3836
02:51:37,491 --> 02:51:39,210
get?
I was wondering about that like are they

3837
02:51:39,211 --> 02:51:40,044
ever going to get too dangerous where 
they're gonna have to alter the rules 

3838
02:51:41,821 --> 02:51:44,520
because there's two athletic they can do
it cause too much damage.

3839
02:51:44,850 --> 02:51:45,683
They're not going to be much different 
than the best of the best now like a 

3840
02:51:47,551 --> 02:51:50,400
Francis and gone to or a steep meo chick
or you know,

3841
02:51:50,401 --> 02:51:51,234
the Tyron Woodley.
We'll look at a guy like tyron woodley 

3842
02:51:53,730 --> 02:51:54,563
that is about as explosive as a man who 
can step on a scale of 170 pounds for a 

3843
02:51:58,591 --> 02:52:00,300
brief amount of time can get.
Yeah.

3844
02:52:00,301 --> 02:52:02,730
And as good as they get,
the competition kind of gets better too.

3845
02:52:02,731 --> 02:52:05,100
So yeah,
Tyron Woodley people from UFC two,

3846
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:06,460
you'd be like,
this should be illegal.

3847
02:52:09,170 --> 02:52:13,450
Versus Tyrone Woodley could fight 60 
people in a row.

3848
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:16,270
Seen 10.
Taiwan is only one 70.

3849
02:52:16,271 --> 02:52:17,104
I mean he wouldn't be,
but if they had real world 70 fighters 

3850
02:52:20,320 --> 02:52:21,930
voice was one 70.
Yeah,

3851
02:52:21,940 --> 02:52:25,210
he's bigger than toys.
He's really about two five ish,

3852
02:52:25,240 --> 02:52:30,240
but those have been having problems 
won't be the UFC Frye.

3853
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:36,560
Once you got into don fraud,
Don Frye was a big fella.

3854
02:52:38,040 --> 02:52:38,873
He's very much just landed knockout shot
before don frye could also take a 

3855
02:52:42,521 --> 02:52:43,354
tremendous punch fight with Don Frye and
talking Yama where they just did in 

3856
02:52:45,881 --> 02:52:47,200
front of each other and wailed on each 
other.

3857
02:52:47,630 --> 02:52:48,670
Bam,
Bam,

3858
02:52:48,671 --> 02:52:49,504
Bam,
Bam.

3859
02:52:49,670 --> 02:52:50,503
Football.
Just landed right hand after right hand 

3860
02:52:51,521 --> 02:52:52,354
like a fucking movie.
It was one of the craziest things 

3861
02:52:54,101 --> 02:52:58,310
anybody ever saw.
I won't go down as a man.

3862
02:52:58,350 --> 02:53:00,880
He's hilarious.
He's got on the podcast.

3863
02:53:00,881 --> 02:53:01,571
No,
I have not.

3864
02:53:01,571 --> 02:53:02,404
I would love to though.
He was a boss and he's a great 

3865
02:53:05,141 --> 02:53:05,974
personality.

3866
02:53:06,130 --> 02:53:06,963
It.
We had them calling a few times the 

3867
02:53:08,041 --> 02:53:09,550
animal.
He doesn't give a fuck.

3868
02:53:09,580 --> 02:53:10,413
He's hilarious.
And he paid the price physically for 

3869
02:53:12,131 --> 02:53:13,190
that career,
you know,

3870
02:53:13,230 --> 02:53:14,063
he said some serious health consequences
like real neck injuries and his body 

3871
02:53:18,701 --> 02:53:19,534
just got beat the fuck up.
Like he had real neck and back problems 

3872
02:53:23,770 --> 02:53:27,310
from all those punches and take downs 
and net cranks and all that shit.

3873
02:53:27,340 --> 02:53:28,690
You know,
he was there the early,

3874
02:53:28,691 --> 02:53:29,524
early,
early days to now this is the one like 

3875
02:53:30,740 --> 02:53:34,390
he gets hit with a knee and they get an 
email and each other.

3876
02:53:34,570 --> 02:53:37,290
It's crazy dude,
but this is why we got into mma.

3877
02:53:37,730 --> 02:53:39,910
Jesus.
Fucking crazy.

3878
02:53:40,150 --> 02:53:41,320
I mean,
look at these guys.

3879
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:43,360
I mean,
it doesn't seem real.

3880
02:53:43,450 --> 02:53:44,283
It literally doesn't seem real that they
could just stand and wail on each other 

3881
02:53:47,441 --> 02:53:49,990
and talking how his face is just a 
swollen mass.

3882
02:53:49,991 --> 02:53:52,390
After this don fries caught on the 
forehead.

3883
02:53:52,390 --> 02:53:55,810
It was fucking crazy.
But Don fry,

3884
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:59,950
he was one of the first guys to figure 
out a way to shut down.

3885
02:54:00,100 --> 02:54:01,830
We're talking about the other day with 
Pat Miletich,

3886
02:54:01,990 --> 02:54:04,060
shut down Brazilian Jujitsu.
Guys like this look,

3887
02:54:04,210 --> 02:54:05,043
look at his fucking mount.
Like he was a real good wrestler and he 

3888
02:54:07,151 --> 02:54:10,390
had a very good top game and he also was
a good boxer too,

3889
02:54:10,930 --> 02:54:11,763
and just a fucking stud just to start 
and just tell the guy in the world 

3890
02:54:15,191 --> 02:54:15,581
either,
you know,

3891
02:54:15,581 --> 02:54:17,350
he first,
when he first fought in the UFC,

3892
02:54:17,351 --> 02:54:18,184
I believe he was only 200 pounds and he 
fought a guy who was like three 

3893
02:54:22,451 --> 02:54:24,490
something and fucked him up in like six 
seconds.

3894
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:25,773
He fought some big overweight guy and he
cracked him with a jab and dropped him 

3895
02:54:28,541 --> 02:54:30,820
with a jab.
Is just beat them down real quick.

3896
02:54:30,940 --> 02:54:31,773
I think you'd beat everyone until he ran
into Mark Coleman in the UFC and then 

3897
02:54:34,571 --> 02:54:37,030
that was just like just to client 
wrestler who too big,

3898
02:54:37,031 --> 02:54:37,864
too strong.

3899
02:54:38,020 --> 02:54:39,700
Literally how many in Dave Smith became 
friends.

3900
02:54:39,701 --> 02:54:44,650
We were roommates and we sort of renting
UFC like that's how we got into UFC.

3901
02:54:44,680 --> 02:54:45,341
Yeah,
best stuff.

3902
02:54:45,341 --> 02:54:47,350
Knock out videos together,
smoking blunts,

3903
02:54:47,960 --> 02:54:50,700
Bruce back days,
you know.

3904
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:51,693
It was weird is that we got into it and 
like right around the time that we were 

3905
02:54:54,521 --> 02:54:55,354
getting into UFC,
the ultimate fighter dropped so it was 

3906
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:58,624
almost like we got into it at the same 
time that the country got into it when 

3907
02:55:01,931 --> 02:55:02,764
we got into it a few months earlier and 
then all of a sudden this thing no one 

3908
02:55:04,491 --> 02:55:06,920
gave a shit about was just like blowing 
up.

3909
02:55:07,270 --> 02:55:08,103
I remember we got to do during season 
one so much that season to the fire was 

3910
02:55:10,341 --> 02:55:10,911
coming out.
We were like,

3911
02:55:10,911 --> 02:55:13,550
do it this season to ultimate fighter.
This is fucking nuts.

3912
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:15,380
Fights on TV.
Let's do it.

3913
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:17,960
And there wasn't a fight in the first 
episode of season two.

3914
02:55:18,250 --> 02:55:20,240
We were furious,
we almost broke our tv,

3915
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:22,590
we watch old episodes.

3916
02:55:25,190 --> 02:55:26,023
That's funny,
but it was also like a perfect storm of 

3917
02:55:27,951 --> 02:55:28,784
like people getting interested in it and
then having that ultimate fighter 

3918
02:55:31,161 --> 02:55:33,290
reality show back in the days where 
people,

3919
02:55:33,650 --> 02:55:35,750
you know,
I still watch reality shows back then,

3920
02:55:35,751 --> 02:55:38,720
now you can't even fucking holding a gun
to my head and get me to watch a reality

3921
02:55:38,721 --> 02:55:40,880
show unless they're trying to survive in
Alaska.

3922
02:55:41,070 --> 02:55:45,200
I got like five of those saved.
I love those shows like life below zero.

3923
02:55:45,201 --> 02:55:47,390
That's my jam dude.
I love that show.

3924
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:51,830
But out there finding salmon shit to eat
and just chopping down trees,

3925
02:55:51,831 --> 02:55:54,830
try to stay alive that,
that I could maybe get into,

3926
02:55:54,980 --> 02:55:55,813
but I will say I think there's something
interesting about the post reality show 

3927
02:55:57,921 --> 02:55:59,840
world.
Like we got over reality shows,

3928
02:55:59,841 --> 02:56:00,674
but I feel like we're never the same.
Like you never quite go back to like 

3929
02:56:03,050 --> 02:56:06,230
even just like in like what you do with 
this show versus a radio show.

3930
02:56:06,231 --> 02:56:08,340
Like you're not starting to like Hello 
Ladies and gentlemen,

3931
02:56:08,490 --> 02:56:10,790
a little shake,
Hobo.

3932
02:56:13,140 --> 02:56:14,450
We don't want any of that.
Now.

3933
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:16,280
We just want like an honest 
conversation.

3934
02:56:16,281 --> 02:56:17,110
I feel like in,
in,

3935
02:56:17,110 --> 02:56:17,943
in entertainment in general,
you want something that it just seems 

3936
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:23,030
it's not as showy.
It's more just like what real life would

3937
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:23,873
be.
Yeah,

3938
02:56:24,330 --> 02:56:26,390
that's a,
that's what people want for sure.

3939
02:56:26,420 --> 02:56:28,910
You know what I mean?
And the thing about it is it's like it's

3940
02:56:28,911 --> 02:56:31,490
led to a guy who was a reality star was 
the president.

3941
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:35,020
That's as weird as it gets.
I mean that,

3942
02:56:35,060 --> 02:56:37,780
that is a reality star president.
He's not a politician,

3943
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:38,633
just a businessman got on a TV show,
was a big time celebrity and now he won 

3944
02:56:43,311 --> 02:56:46,400
a popularity contest.
So he's the runner of the country,

3945
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:47,273
you know,
like that isn't an advertisement for 

3946
02:56:48,621 --> 02:56:51,230
just fucking motivation.
I don't know what you want to say.

3947
02:56:51,231 --> 02:56:52,730
Like he just said,
I want that,

3948
02:56:52,820 --> 02:56:56,030
or just an advertisement for how much 
fucking system sucks.

3949
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:58,750
My favorite thing about Donald Trump is 
like,

3950
02:56:58,950 --> 02:56:59,783
I've never.
I used to have to really argue with 

3951
02:57:01,041 --> 02:57:03,170
lefties about butthead.
Democracy is a flawed system,

3952
02:57:03,171 --> 02:57:04,280
but now you just look at it.
You're like,

3953
02:57:04,290 --> 02:57:05,300
no.
So how about that?

3954
02:57:05,370 --> 02:57:06,203
Yeah.
He was able to convince more fucking 

3955
02:57:07,530 --> 02:57:09,980
than your person was Christina.
Now he's your leader.

3956
02:57:10,070 --> 02:57:10,903
Awesome.
If you have four people and they're all 

3957
02:57:11,931 --> 02:57:13,400
equally intelligent.
Yeah,

3958
02:57:13,540 --> 02:57:14,373
that's right.
I'll get together and figure something 

3959
02:57:15,381 --> 02:57:16,214
out rationally,
but when you get to a place where you 

3960
02:57:17,571 --> 02:57:20,360
can't even communicate with those people
anymore because it's $300 million of you

3961
02:57:20,510 --> 02:57:21,343
and you're scattered across a continent,
but you're all supposed to be on the 

3962
02:57:23,751 --> 02:57:26,480
same team,
voting over like really important issues

3963
02:57:26,481 --> 02:57:27,950
that you probably don't even know 
anything about,

3964
02:57:27,951 --> 02:57:30,920
like what you're talking about earlier 
about assault weapons or fracking.

3965
02:57:31,160 --> 02:57:34,130
You'd be bringing up anything to certain
people offshore drilling.

3966
02:57:34,130 --> 02:57:34,970
What?
What are we doing?

3967
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:37,940
The other thing is that we're supposed 
to be for or against fracking.

3968
02:57:37,941 --> 02:57:40,070
I have no idea.
You definitely shouldn't be for it.

3969
02:57:40,250 --> 02:57:41,083
I don't think it's.
I think it's proven that it's safe long 

3970
02:57:42,791 --> 02:57:45,950
term because there's getting.
They're getting into water supplies that

3971
02:57:45,951 --> 02:57:48,200
causing earthquakes.
There's a lot of real,

3972
02:57:48,530 --> 02:57:49,363
real consequence.
There's definitely a lot of problems 

3973
02:57:50,601 --> 02:57:51,434
with it.
There's also definitely a lot of wealth 

3974
02:57:52,671 --> 02:57:55,180
that was created on the energy,
that energy.

3975
02:57:55,220 --> 02:57:56,053
Those are positive things and negative.
The problem is everybody wants to 

3976
02:57:59,441 --> 02:58:02,250
discount the negative or the positive

3977
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:03,270
note with you.
Yes.

3978
02:58:03,270 --> 02:58:05,790
No one agrees that it's actually a cost 
benefit ratio,

3979
02:58:05,910 --> 02:58:06,743
but the thing that's like what you were 
saying before with like with four 

3980
02:58:08,461 --> 02:58:09,690
people,
democracy works,

3981
02:58:09,780 --> 02:58:11,580
but I think a lot of it is like,
okay,

3982
02:58:11,581 --> 02:58:12,414
so if we get into a fucking thing,
like let's say we're in a car crash and 

3983
02:58:16,021 --> 02:58:18,390
one of the people in the car or a car 
breaks down rather,

3984
02:58:18,480 --> 02:58:20,190
and one of the people in the cars,
the mechanic,

3985
02:58:20,580 --> 02:58:21,720
we don't sit here and go like,
well,

3986
02:58:21,721 --> 02:58:23,520
let's vote.
Who gets to do this?

3987
02:58:23,521 --> 02:58:24,151
You just go,
well,

3988
02:58:24,151 --> 02:58:24,984
you're a mechanic.
The three of us are out in the fucking 

3989
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:29,340
woods hunting elk.
Me and Louis don't go like,

3990
02:58:29,341 --> 02:58:30,820
well,
I think we should do it this way because

3991
02:58:31,220 --> 02:58:32,990
you've done this larger.
You don't have all day.

3992
02:58:33,270 --> 02:58:37,360
You're going to ruin the whole 
experience.

3993
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,633
Most of the time,
just pure voting isn't how you get to 

3994
02:58:40,951 --> 02:58:41,200
something.

3995
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:44,670
You defer to experts and when you just 
have this voting thing where it's like,

3996
02:58:44,671 --> 02:58:45,960
well,
we'll all just cast a vote.

3997
02:58:45,961 --> 02:58:48,000
The dumb people the same as the smart 
people,

3998
02:58:48,090 --> 02:58:50,070
the educated,
the same as the uneducated.

3999
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:53,790
You end up with a fucking this 
competition to just say bullshit.

4000
02:58:53,910 --> 02:58:55,200
That gets anyone up.
Well,

4001
02:58:55,201 --> 02:58:57,140
I'm going to make America great again.
Well,

4002
02:58:57,200 --> 02:59:00,240
Donald Trump and powers the worst 
elements of our society and you're like,

4003
02:59:00,241 --> 02:59:02,430
this is all fucking retarded.
I gotTa pee again.

4004
02:59:02,460 --> 02:59:03,293
I can't believe this too.
Should we end it or should we keep 

4005
02:59:05,611 --> 02:59:07,950
going?
We're at three hours.

4006
02:59:08,090 --> 02:59:08,880
All right.
We should end it.

4007
02:59:08,880 --> 02:59:12,060
If two of the three of us need a pill,
I am so excited that we did this.

4008
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:14,490
We got to do this more often.
When you guys going to be in la again,

4009
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:16,920
next time you invite us on this.
Again,

4010
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:21,780
this is surprisingly,
it worked really well with for people to

4011
02:59:22,240 --> 02:59:23,760
step on each other.
It was a lot of fun.

4012
02:59:23,761 --> 02:59:27,210
Man,
of course is available everywhere.

4013
02:59:27,270 --> 02:59:28,740
Are you guys on Youtube as well or just 
on?

4014
02:59:29,390 --> 02:59:31,180
Oh yeah,
everywhere.

4015
02:59:31,200 --> 02:59:33,420
We have our own platform called gas 
digital network.com.

4016
02:59:33,421 --> 02:59:37,140
That's our network.
Fast is a July 14th and 15th.

4017
02:59:37,141 --> 02:59:38,540
Presale tickets,
April second.

4018
02:59:39,670 --> 02:59:44,670
Twitter from tickets on sale when a 
April second is presale.

4019
02:59:46,261 --> 02:59:47,880
It's gonna be nuts.
Where do they buy the tickets?

4020
02:59:48,540 --> 02:59:50,170
NYC Dot com.
All right.

4021
02:59:50,250 --> 02:59:51,450
All right everybody.
Thank you.

4022
02:59:51,530 --> 02:59:52,363
Bye.
