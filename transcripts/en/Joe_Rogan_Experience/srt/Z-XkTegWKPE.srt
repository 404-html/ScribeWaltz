1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,210
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,410
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:04,950
one.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,730
Dude,
it seemed like we just did this.

5
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,580
It does feel pretty recently.
A year ago.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,920
I don't know.
I don't know.

7
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,750
It's already October.
I'm scared.

8
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,880
Let's just fuck and spark up a joint 
launch.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,410
One of them backwards.
Now.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,240
One of these backwards.
These are so good.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,350
Just smell it.

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,270
Just smell.
Whoa.

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,670
Yeah.

14
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,660
You know,
everyone was commenting on your blunt 

15
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:32,660
rolling technique after the Elon Musk 
thing.

16
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,150
Oh,
I don't roll them.

17
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:33,720
I know.
They were like,

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,830
and I knew that.
They were like,

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,490
oh,
what does he.

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,900
He just,
he can barely roll a blunt.

21
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:37,970
I was like,
you're the professional in the world.

22
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,080
It's a pretty real good bond.
You can't read.

23
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,040
That.
Smells good.

24
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,470
It smells so good.
They taste good too.

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,820
There's a.
those are phenomenal.

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,710
The I,
I'm a blunt man.

27
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,400
Yeah,
I know.

28
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:52,401
It's probably bad for your lungs,
but there's something about the tobacco 

29
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,331
gets you a little high up and then the 
marijuana sort of like spreads you out 

30
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,280
and it puts you in like a new dimension.
Yeah,

31
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,810
that's,
that's a good one.

32
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm going to get blitz grieved after 
Halloween.

33
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,530
Kids,
oh yeah.

34
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,210
Imagine how high you'll get to after 30 
days.

35
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,690
Last year I did.

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,720
I did comedy.
I had no idea what I was talking about 

37
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:14,720
while I was on stage.
I was like,

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,981
oh my God,
this 400 people in this room know what 

39
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:21,181
I'm saying.
I always thought of bringing in all my 

40
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,181
marijuana and booze in here.
Like,

41
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,890
like why like it?
Like in the old West when you have to 

42
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,860
turn in your guns and just dumping them 
on the table because I have so much 

43
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,610
marijuana.
It's ridiculous.

44
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,720
I know.
It's crazy.

45
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,110
I keep a stack of whiskey over there and
then we've got another cabinet full in 

46
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,800
the back.
Yeah,

47
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,540
you could get fucked up hard for you 
here in this place.

48
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,560
We're going to ripped on the back.
Remember when we did the podcast on the 

49
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,780
day back.
Those were,

50
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,510
those were fun shit.
Those clients so much more fun when he's

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,800
high and grumpy when he's sober.
I such a grouchy dog,

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,190
like legit,
angry,

53
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:59,370
like he could joke around about anything
when he's high,

54
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,520
when he smokes weed,
but then when he's not smoking weed,

55
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:02,880
you're like,
wait,

56
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:03,210
wait,
wait.

57
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,130
Are you fucking serious?
He gets upset.

58
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,010
Do you remember when you texted the 
three of us?

59
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,020
Who are you?
I don't think you're doing the right 

60
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,020
classes.
Do you remember?

61
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,750
You think you're going to have to do 
them again?

62
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,770
Joking.
I love you.

63
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,000
He called you.
He called you upset.

64
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,780
Oh yeah.
Yeah,

65
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,330
he was upset.
I don't remember if we texted or called,

66
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,910
but I go,
I love you.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,790
I'm just joking.
I'm sure you do.

68
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,100
The one thing about Arias,
this is one thing that you could say 

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,230
after all the welding talking on the 
nonsense.

70
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,720
Ari has rock solid ethics off.
Yes,

71
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,890
he does.
Like if Ari says going to do something,

72
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,010
he does it like so if I'm fucking with 
him and saying I don't think you're 

73
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,140
doing it like I don't really mean.
Right,

74
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,850
right.
You're just kind of,

75
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,900
you're poking at them.
Right?

76
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,740
So if you're out there already and you 
hear this molly fucking around,

77
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,530
I know you're doing it.
He can talk to you for the next 30 days.

78
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,960
Dangerous.
He came back,

79
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:08,070
he came to our class for that last one.
He was so much easier than most clubs 

80
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,271
can believe.
You questioned how hard my class one we 

81
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:12,271
didn't.
Encino.

82
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:12,271
Yes.
He was like,

83
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,720
this is so easy compared to what I've 
been doing in New York.

84
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,670
Like it's all easy.
If you go easy,

85
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,890
I guess it's all how you do it.
If you.

86
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,880
If you do hot yoga and you go 100 
percent every pose.

87
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,930
Yeah.
It's fucking hard to the matter who's 

88
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:26,930
teaching?
Yeah,

89
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,221
it's hard.
But there's this guy that I go to a 

90
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:29,860
hundred percent.
I have a drinking problem,

91
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,861
legit drinking water.
There's this guy that I go to yoga with 

92
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,110
a who is a.
he's.

93
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,350
It seems like he just doesn't ever go 
100 percent.

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,770
He started just kinda like,
you know,

95
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:46,090
you put your arms above your head.
He always does this.

96
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,210
He's never doing this research.
Fully stretched to extend his palms net 

97
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,450
connected.
When you do that,

98
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,300
it's hard,
right?

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
If you just kind of half ass every pose 
and do this.

100
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,790
Yeah,
you can get through a 90 minute class.

101
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,440
You're not doing the same thing as if 
you do.

102
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:04,441
If you do any of you ever go to like a 
group training class somewhere you can 

103
00:04:04,441 --> 00:04:07,760
see people and there's like a 63 year 
old lady who's doing a with.

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,970
She's on her knees.
She was like,

105
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,580
this is hard,
and talking at a normal rate,

106
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,300
you're like,
you're not.

107
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,380
You're not doing it.
Yeah.

108
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,880
I got in trouble with my crossfit class 
because I was just getting pissed.

109
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:21,250
I was throwing up everyday.
I was throwing up every single day.

110
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,040
I was also drinking a coffee right 
before it started,

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,460
so it's throwing up coffee every single 
day and one day I just snapped.

112
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,760
I go,
Hey,

113
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,190
the black guy's not doing his burpees.
The black guy.

114
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,120
That's what they said,
Joe.

115
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,550
That's what they said.
We don't talk like that.

116
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,610
It's got a name.
I go in,

117
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,460
I don't know it,
but I'm pointing to him.

118
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,150
He's not doing his burpees and then.
And then the joke I made out of it was,

119
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,740
hey,
a Wendell,

120
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,110
the gay guy says I can't call you the 
black guy but you're not doing.

121
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:49,111
You're throwing it back to a cross fit.
I liked the idea that we're doing this 

122
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,140
in general heart rate sense because you 
can sprinkle it in.

123
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:56,500
I want to go to a spin class.
And by the way that is how,

124
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,410
if you want to like get a real bump in 
those points,

125
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,010
it's about a bumping heart like 
sustained accelerated heart rate.

126
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,500
So a spin class is gonna get you a 
bunch.

127
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,680
You know what I mean?
It's not like Joe,

128
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,310
I don't know if you know that he's like 
a way better athlete than you,

129
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,000
but it doesn't mean that we put pin in 
that.

130
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,310
It doesn't mean the month to find me 
that he'll automatically beat us because

131
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:24,781
he's in better physical condition.
You can actually beat them if you're 

132
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,951
going to push it all the time.
What is it in your brain that makes you 

133
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:33,241
do that?
Because we just looked at your map and 

134
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:33,820
you burned a thousand calories.
Is there some sort of.

135
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,910
I talked to Pat McAfee one time,
he said it's about exclusivity.

136
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,320
It's about rape and murder.
My head's filled with it.

137
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,790
Stopping rapists and stop and murderers 
and killing child molesters.

138
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,791
That's where.
Think about killing bad people when you 

139
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:50,791
work out.
That's what I do.

140
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:51,370
When I get tired,
I get tired.

141
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,590
I think about like saving someone I care
about.

142
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,160
I think about stopping someone is trying
to murder someone I love.

143
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,130
That's what I think

144
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,250
about.
I love your face.

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,040
I'm not kidding.
I think about my second wife.

146
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,910
I think about protecting people I care 
about.

147
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,910
Can you tell me one time you'll.
If it's hard,

148
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,340
you'll go a pretending someone is trying
to kill me.

149
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

150
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,470
So you're like pretending.
Yeah.

151
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,220
I really don't have words for that.

152
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,530
That's what you gotta do.
Cause that's,

153
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,170
that's what if you think about worst 
case scenario,

154
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,320
you're tired and someone's trying to 
kill someone you care about and you 

155
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,450
don't have enough energy to stop them.

156
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,960
But do you think you learned that switch
in?

157
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,940
Like a type one is not talking window a 
crow a learned from martial arts?

158
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:37,640
For sure.
Yeah.

159
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,660
Yeah,
sure,

160
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,260
yeah,
yeah,

161
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,600
because that's the scariest place you 
could ever be.

162
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,240
Like the scariest place that you could 
be is life and death.

163
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,400
So like just putting yourself in.
Oh,

164
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,800
just want to lose weight.
Okay,

165
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,000
good.
Yeah,

166
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,610
that's good.
But that's not.

167
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,800
You're not going to save yourself like 
you got.

168
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:58,880
You got to put yourself in like 
animalistic fury.

169
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,740
That's how you gotta you gotta put 
yourself,

170
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,360
you gotta to put yourself in this state 
of just 100 percent effort.

171
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,910
I was pegged at 180 177 beats per minute
for the last 35,

172
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,680
35 minutes.

173
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,240
That's really,
it's got to do it.

174
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,040
See that David Goggins guy had gotten my
head with a.

175
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,350
just embrace the suck.
Yeah,

176
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:27,351
I can.
I can get there where I go and just 

177
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:27,351
like,
like during the marathon I just go,

178
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,260
this is where I'm going to be for the 
next five and a half hours.

179
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,150
This is where I'm at and is what I'm 
doing and I can,

180
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,180
I can wrap my head around that.
I don't know if I can wrap my head 

181
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,941
around like I don't know,
the explosive activity of it and going 

182
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,761
like,
I'm going to save my family and then 

183
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:40,761
getting,
but that might not work for you,

184
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:41,370
but there still could be a different 
tactic that works for you.

185
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,660
You know what I mean?
Even like bat going that fucking hard to

186
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:49,140
where your body is completely giving 
out.

187
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,840
There's part of me that goes,
hey man,

188
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,780
what are we doing here?

189
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,400
You know,
like when I'm working out,

190
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,140
I go,
it's really fucking hard.

191
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:00,290
Well,
you definitely have to protect your 

192
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,290
health,
right?

193
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:00,960
Like the last you want to be doing this 
and having a heart attack.

194
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,730
That's my.
That's always my fear is I go,

195
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,450
easy buddy.
Easy buddy is a good way to look at it,

196
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,170
but I've been doing that kind of working
out forever.

197
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
That's how it worked out.
Yeah,

198
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
that's.
You've always were crazy.

199
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,270
Yeah,
I go crazy.

200
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,010
Have you ever thought about someone who 
like really disrespected you right 

201
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,010
before you lift?
You know what I mean?

202
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,970
Like that's all that happens online.
You can't read that Shit because I've 

203
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:31,740
gone to like a moment where you're like,
I wish I would have cracked that dude in

204
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:33,930
the face.
And then right before,

205
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,620
right before I said no,
I have not,

206
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,620
and I know I'm definitely know what I 
want.

207
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,360
I know who I'm thinking about.
I'm going to try it.

208
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,290
All right.
Don't say any names.

209
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,620
What does he rhyme with in order to like
egg

210
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,810
to really get yourself into that place?
You know,

211
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,250
you don't have to think about something 
that's terrifying and negative,

212
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,980
but to me that's like,

213
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,390
that's the ultimate position that where 
you're going to need energy.

214
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,470
This is so silly.
That one.

215
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,980
The best shape I've ever been in is when
I met my wife.

216
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:09,981
I was 186 pounds.
I look at Jamie type in skinny burt.

217
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,540
I've almost had a six pack repack and I 
had like side muscle,

218
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,060
a little little oblique.
I'm going for that this year.

219
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,890
This month I'm going to.
I'm going hard.

220
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,000
This month I've,
I've got,

221
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,090
I said to Jamie,
I made a deal with myself every day I'm 

222
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,421
going to do air squats and 50 pushups.
I was going to do 100 look at skinny 

223
00:09:29,421 --> 00:09:33,080
burt posing,
but you are a fucking stud.

224
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,940
There was when I was in spin class.
Look how skinny her face is.

225
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Well,
your sphere face was super skinny after 

226
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:41,260
last year.
Sober October.

227
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,410
That photo that you posted that you sent
to us skinny face.

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,450
I'm going back.
I'm going hard this month.

229
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,580
I really am.
And I'm gonna.

230
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,090
Enjoy it.
Last month,

231
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,950
I think last time I did it was out of 
spite.

232
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,870
I wanted to prove to everyone I could 
stop drinking.

233
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,050
This month I'm going into it having not 
drank probably a third as much as last 

234
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,390
year,
meaning like I've drank three quarters 

235
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:02,390
as much.
Does that make sense?

236
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:02,460
And so,
um,

237
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,970
but when I was in spend cost,
we had bob from the biggest loser was 

238
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,281
our spin class teacher crunch.
This is Bob the coach from the biggest 

239
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:12,270
loser contest.
And I never watched that show.

240
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,890
He was,
he was amazing.

241
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,850
His inspiration was so connect key 
connected to me so quickly.

242
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,300
One time,
it's right before Thanksgiving and I'm 

243
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,300
looking good.
I'm going to go to a wedding,

244
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,450
my buddy's wedding and I'm on on the 
bike,

245
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:24,870
and he goes,
all right,

246
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:29,871
everyone out of the saddle is going to 
be on the saddles for two minutes and 

247
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:29,871
I'm like,
fuck this,

248
00:10:29,871 --> 00:10:31,200
and then he says,
you're going,

249
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:31,470
whoa.

250
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,030
I felt like he was talking to me.
He goes,

251
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:38,031
you're going home for thanksgiving.
You're going to see all the people in 

252
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:41,331
high school,
all the people that didn't want to have 

253
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,011
sex with you.
Do you want them to want to have sex 

254
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:43,011
with you this weekend?
And I was like,

255
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:43,011
yeah.
He goes,

256
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,120
that stay out of that fucking saddle 
standard,

257
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,130
that saddle and earn your Thanksgiving 
dinner and go out to bars the night 

258
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,041
before and say,
I won't fuck you on better than you and 

259
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:52,041
I'm just going to want them to fuck me.
I want them to fuck me.

260
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:58,150
I am that bombs.
I think with the heart and the paint 

261
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,690
that connected with me,
so that vanity of like,

262
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,550
I want people to want me.
Isn't that funny,

263
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,710
man?
That bike motivated so many comedians.

264
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,850
Oh,
you know,

265
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,620
just being a loser in high school and 
I'll show you guys.

266
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,020
I'll show you.
There's people that take them,

267
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,510
that takes them straight to their 
deathbed.

268
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,660
They're still like,
yeah,

269
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,190
fucking Sarah is seventh grade.
This is for her.

270
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Yeah.
My motivation is I think of getting to 

271
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,970
the bottom of it is I want people to 
like me because I know.

272
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,960
I know,
but I think it's on.

273
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,250
I do that in an unhealthy way.
I think I was pretty good speaking with.

274
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,050
Thank you.

275
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,980
You to liking my special is the best 
compliments I've gotten.

276
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,740
You worked hard at it.
Thank you very much.

277
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,360
Everyone has secrets.
I mean streaming right now,

278
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:45,570
but Joe Rogan special drops tomorrow,
tonight,

279
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,680
tonight at midnight.
I saw that dude that that trailer is one

280
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,750
of the best trailers I've seen for a 
special in a long time.

281
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,100
I worked hard at it.
I hope people like it.

282
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,900
Some people are gonna hate it,
but that's normal.

283
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,100
I worked at it as hard as anything I've 
ever worked on ever.

284
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,450
For sure.
This our.

285
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

286
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:07,350
I fucking went hard on this one.
Good feeling to go to get done with 

287
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,350
something.
I did the best I could do.

288
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,430
I did the best I could do for sure 100 
percent.

289
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:11,890
I couldn't have done any better because 
if I did any more.

290
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,920
The only thing that you could say is 
maybe a little more time like maybe a 

291
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,400
month or two more time on some of the 
bits like,

292
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:20,400
but you never know when that is,
you know,

293
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,360
it's like there's a,
there's a,

294
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,600
there's a sort of like a period where 
they're developing and then they mature 

295
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,891
and then they're solid and then you 
never know like are they done or zero 

296
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:35,240
like one more tagline that I'm missing 
here because you know how like it's 

297
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,820
always the case you film and then right 
after you're done you have a brand new 

298
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:38,820
tagline that makes the bit.

299
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,730
It's like the next Saturday that mother 
Fucker,

300
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,770
but next week I wrote that.
Did that special the next week I'm in,

301
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,020
I'm in Michigan doing some theater and 
uh,

302
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,160
I have that Alexa bit about.
I'm fucking Alexa talking back,

303
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,180
talk to Alexa.
Like I talked to women in whatever the 

304
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,301
bid is and the next week I write the bit
we set a fleshlight attachment for 

305
00:12:59,301 --> 00:12:59,320
Lexus.
Are you shut up the way I want to.

306
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,530
Fuck God damn it.
Where the fuck was that?

307
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,570
God Damn it.
Mind doesn't open up.

308
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,960
Your mind isn't open up all the way 
until it's like,

309
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,060
it doesn't have any pressure.
The pressure's gone and then you're 

310
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,060
like,
oh,

311
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,940
I can take it here.
I can take it there.

312
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:17,941
And you're like,
I wish I could think like this before I 

313
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:17,941
record.
But you can't.

314
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:21,520
You know what's interesting is that 
we've talked about this the after the 

315
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,051
specials over,
like I don't have any material and I 

316
00:13:25,051 --> 00:13:25,051
don't have anything to think about.

317
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,190
But you always find it like overtime and
then before you know,

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,620
like,
wow,

319
00:13:29,621 --> 00:13:30,810
I got to do our.
Yeah,

320
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,150
it happens.
It happens and it happens quicker the 

321
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,150
more you've done it.
Yeah.

322
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,460
Yeah.
Because you know you can do it.

323
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,650
That's one of the sad things about these
guys.

324
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,210
Like I was talking to a guy the other 
day,

325
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,610
like how long you been doing comedy?
And he's like seven years.

326
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,530
I go,
how much time do you have?

327
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,270
He's like 20 minutes.
Like,

328
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:46,900
oh,
that's fucking ruthlessly unacceptable.

329
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,980
It's terrible.
I go,

330
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,010
you are lazy when you've been doing 
comedy for seven years,

331
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,680
you have 20 minutes and out of those 20 
minutes 10 you should throw away.

332
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,150
Right?
That's crazy.

333
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,430
But that's what happened.
But they're not doing it enough.

334
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,490
You're not doing it enough.
They don't get enough sets in this,

335
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,930
you know,
it's hard.

336
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,540
You do an open mics and when you're 
doing open mics,

337
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,600
everyone's sucks.
So you look like a hero if you have 

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,031
anything that's remotely humorous,
but then you try that remotely humorous 

339
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:13,790
stuff and you do it on at the Ice House 
and people like,

340
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,940
yeah,
go on.

341
00:14:15,941 --> 00:14:18,590
Between you and you and you know you do 
this bullshit.

342
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,650
They're used to doing an open mic night 
and people just not having it.

343
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:24,730
So a real sets are so different than if 
you don't,

344
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,430
if you don't get in front of real crowds
and it's not,

345
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,020
you know,
it's not entirely up to you.

346
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,940
Obviously when you're starting out,
it's hard to get.

347
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,810
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

348
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,550
Real crowds?
Like a real show.

349
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:34,620
A professional.
Oh,

350
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,830
like those shows an open mic,
you know?

351
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,200
That's why it's invaluable.
Like even if you give somebody an 

352
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,500
opportunity to come on your show for 
them,

353
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,150
like a,
an up and comer,

354
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,480
because they don't normally have real 
audiences perform in front of giant for 

355
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,940
them.
It's a wake up call.

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,870
Oh yeah.
Then they're like,

357
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,310
Holy Shit,
this is a real show.

358
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,770
People have expectations and they pay 
money.

359
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,870
When you go to one of those open mic 
nights,

360
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:02,240
people are just drunk and everyone's 
terrible.

361
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:06,860
So you're just laughing at basically 
anything you can kill,

362
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:07,880
but how bad they are.

363
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,550
People are just like slamming,
made almost career out of that.

364
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,430
Yeah.
Peter Chen,

365
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,640
who was a guy who is so bad.
I,

366
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,900
Chris Mcguire was auditioning for Mitzi 
and Peter.

367
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,350
Mitzi thought it was funny because Mitzi
was so hilarious.

368
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,650
She thought it was funny that one of the
worst comics in La don't pull his 

369
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,100
picture up,
was hosting the open mic night.

370
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:38,300
Really?
Yeah.

371
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:43,301
She thought it was funny and.
But I knew that mcguire was going to 

372
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:43,580
have to audition for Mitzi,
so I said fuck that.

373
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,540
So I called up the store.
I said,

374
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,830
I'm hosting.
I said,

375
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:49,100
I'll host the open Mike Nights Jenelle 
styles to the open mic night,

376
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,220
just just to keep him from hosting it.
That's great.

377
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,470
So you did that like as a save for your 
buddy?

378
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,190
Yeah,
yeah,

379
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,220
because I knew he was gonna you know,
this would be too much to address and 

380
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,440
you have three minutes.
That'd be too much.

381
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,910
Too much chaos to address.

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I hosted a show as a favor one time and 
ended up snapping on a lady in the 

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,120
yachting and ruined the show and they 
were like,

384
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,080
thanks.
Why did you a dude?

385
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:19,150
Because I arrived,
it was a showcase for Montreal and I 

386
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,150
arrived at the show before it.
Right.

387
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,410
So there's like a 7:00
thing and then the 9:00

388
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:26,411
showcase and they asked me to to host it
and the and a lady at the 7:00

389
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:32,321
show at the earlier show is in like the 
front row just yelling out drunk.

390
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,850
And she's older and she's like,
yeah,

391
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,420
like tagging every comics thing,
commenting on it.

392
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,050
And I'm like,
Oh,

393
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,640
I'm just so irritated.
I'm like,

394
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:43,490
well at least you know,
the show's almost over.

395
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,670
So the show ends,
you know,

396
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:49,040
people leave,
we're getting ready to our second show.

397
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,590
I look,
she stayed in her seat and I was like,

398
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,090
you gotta be kidding me.
So second show starts and I'm already,

399
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,290
you're primed.
You know,

400
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:02,291
like if you watch something that gets 
you agitated and then you're like,

401
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,820
yeah,
you're overreacting because you're like,

402
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:09,821
you're primed for it.
So like it started and it was like I 

403
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,420
said like my first joke and she said,
I go,

404
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:12,410
you fucking cunt.

405
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,460
Shut up.
So people in the audience like don't 

406
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:24,010
talk to her like that.
And I'm like,

407
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:26,080
you don't know what she's doing.
So.

408
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,140
And then it just went really like given 
up for this guy wants to go to Montreal.

409
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,150
It was terrible.
It was terrible.

410
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:35,320
Oh No.

411
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,360
But then she ended up leaving.
Her friend came back in and while I'm 

412
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,420
onstage goes,
did you call her a cunt?

413
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,760
Like in the show?
And I go,

414
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:44,990
yeah,
she goes,

415
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:47,000
that's my friend.
And I go within your control.

416
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,130
She leaves

417
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,890
and her son comes back,
her son comes home to me,

418
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,910
talk to you for a second.
And I was like,

419
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,250
alright.
And it looks serious too.

420
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,430
And he was like,
you call my mom a cunt when I go,

421
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,990
which one is she?
This lady over here.

422
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:11,991
So I go outside and I talked to 
basically the lady who was the friend,

423
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,280
should I go?
She goes,

424
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,510
what is going on?
What go?

425
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,690
Your friend has been disrupting,
yelling out people,

426
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:19,620
drunk,
belligerent.

427
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,230
She goes,
you call her this,

428
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,430
you call me that.
And I go,

429
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:25,650
all right,
well I'm sorry I called you that,

430
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,100
but I'm not sorry.
I called your friend that she is what 

431
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,100
she is.
And she's like,

432
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,690
you can be a nice person.
I see it in you.

433
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,870
I was like,
I was like,

434
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:38,430
yeah,
I go get your friend out of here.

435
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,520
No one wants her here.
Okay.

436
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,260
And she was like,
okay.

437
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,870
And then her son was like,
thank you.

438
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,000
That was very disrespectful to my mother
and I was like,

439
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,500
okay man,
we're good.

440
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,750
I got to go back and host this disaster 
that.

441
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:48,820
Okay.

442
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,750
Oh,
it was such a train wreck.

443
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Well,
some people just think that if you're 

444
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,091
saying something they disagree with,
they don't think that they need to just 

445
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:06,291
like wait it out.
They think they can stop you in the 

446
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:06,291
middle.
For me in particular,

447
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:11,100
a lot of my bits start off one way.
Like they look like they're going to be 

448
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,090
way more outrageous than they are and 
then I turn them around.

449
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Sure.
But when I'm starting it off and then 

450
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,150
you,
you just attack,

451
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,760
like,
like you're fucking up the bit,

452
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:24,761
you know,
you don't even understand what I'm 

453
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:24,761
doing.

454
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:24,761
It's the whole thing about freedom of 
speech in a weird way.

455
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,290
I had a joke about pedophilia and I just
started it.

456
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,740
And the woman,
this woman who was a fan of mine and 

457
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:32,740
everything,
she just goes,

458
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,741
no stop.
And then now it looks like I'm probing 

459
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,130
Ophelia.
I haven't gotten to the fucking 

460
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,720
punchline.
Just looks like I'm in the fucking kids 

461
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:40,720
because they will a lot to finish it.

462
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,830
No,
those people shouldn't be allowed at 

463
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,731
shows because they're not even letting.
They're not even letting the art form 

464
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:47,910
take place.
You can't.

465
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,460
You crafted something.
You don't let it play out.

466
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,300
You can't do that.

467
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,340
I mean you just,
they should just kick you out.

468
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:58,370
You just like,
you're fucking up the whole experience 

469
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,801
for the whole crowd because like a guy 
like Brian holtzman would literally 

470
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:02,400
never be able to perform if the audience
is filled with people like that.

471
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,560
So people like you and I who enjoyed 
them,

472
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,860
we would never be able to see him 
because his whole act is saying 

473
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,850
outrageous shit like that.
That absolutely he doesn't really mean.

474
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Right?
But the funny thing is the twists and 

475
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:16,880
the turns,
right?

476
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,030
And you to laugh at.
The other funny thing is,

477
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,740
is that he supposed to act like he does 
mean it.

478
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,010
That's what's fun like that.
People are like,

479
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,220
always like,
you know,

480
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,490
they get super upset about this thing 
and it's like he said this and they're 

481
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,490
like,
yeah,

482
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:31,490
but don't you get that?
It's,

483
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,590
it's the performance.
I used to have this joke about the 

484
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:36,590
second coming project.

485
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:36,900
Do you know what the second coming 
project is?

486
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:42,590
When they first started fucking around 
with genes and cloning,

487
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:48,410
they um,
there was a group of radical Christians 

488
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,170
that had this idea.
I think it might've,

489
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,630
it might've been bullshit eventually,
but what their idea was they were going 

490
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,621
to take some genetic material from the 
shroud of Turin and they were going to 

491
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:01,180
clone Jesus.
And so my bit was,

492
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,650
what if you clone Jesus and it doesn't 
come out good.

493
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:06,910
Like,
you know,

494
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:11,020
they had to do Dolly the sheep like 30 
times until they got it right.

495
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,630
Like what if,
what if you would,

496
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:18,631
if you cloned Jesus and he comes back 
handicapped and I had this whole fucked 

497
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:22,330
up thing about them following around 
this handicap Jesus.

498
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,930
Instead of turning water into wine,
it turns like dog shit into the cookies.

499
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,980
And so this fucking lady,
this lady goes next subject and she's 

500
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:34,960
sitting in the,
in the,

501
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,830
in the front row.

502
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
So I did the bit to her.
I looked her in the eyes and I kept 

503
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:43,480
doing it,
you know,

504
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,130
by the power of Christ compel you and 
doing it was a horrible pit,

505
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,160
you know,
it's like we're talking like 1998 or 

506
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,160
some shit like that.
Right?

507
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,810
So it was clunky anyway.
But uh,

508
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,000
she's literally saying next subject,
which is,

509
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,110
I'm never gonna Never gonna listen to 
you.

510
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:04,090
Like what?
That's like when you tell someone,

511
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:06,400
shut the fuck up.
Why would they shut the fuck up?

512
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,970
Nobody that doesn't work.
Nobody.

513
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,380
Nobody.
You want them to shut the fuck up.

514
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:16,381
But you have no understanding of the 
power of persuasion or the fact that 

515
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:20,850
other people aren't you.
Like you're not in control of other 

516
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:20,850
people.
So if you tell someone,

517
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,970
shut the fuck up,
like,

518
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,330
that doesn't work.
This is just a poor way of you 

519
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,091
understand,
you don't understand human beings like 

520
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:30,091
you haven't thought this through.

521
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:31,000
You just know what you want your selfish
little head.

522
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,150
And so you say it to them,
this is how most arguments in most 

523
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,091
fights get started because people don't 
take into consideration at all the fact 

524
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:43,471
that they're communicating with another 
human being has their own set of 

525
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:43,471
emotions,
their own life,

526
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:44,620
their own problems,
their own ego.

527
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,280
It's true.
There's a sure fire away any comedy show

528
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,730
to hear more of the same topic because 
they'd be like,

529
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,650
next,
next subject.

530
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,330
Yeah.
That's a.

531
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,380
and that's what I.
I almost sometimes I preface it where I 

532
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,380
go,
hey,

533
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,301
you got like if you don't like what I'm 
about to say because I have a couple of 

534
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,350
things now that are a little too far.
I could just talk to me after the show.

535
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,640
Don't,
don't even do that.

536
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,670
Just don't interrupt things.
I've got 500 people change my mind on 

537
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:14,670
it.

538
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,810
Like I had a bit that worked on the buy 
podcast very well.

539
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,270
And then I've tried it in the club and 
this black chick came up to me and she's

540
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:24,271
like,
it's a really fucked up joke that was 

541
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:24,271
like really super racist or something.
Was it super,

542
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,830
super racist?
Like the black guy at crossfit racist or

543
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,320
I think it might've been worse.
Really.

544
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,520
I don't know.
I don't know.

545
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,940
It didn't bother me.
But by the black chick in DC was like,

546
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:38,941
I love the show all of it.
I just think this is a year ago and I 

547
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:40,610
was like,
a part of me is like a.

548
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,270
is it a bit that's in the special then?
No,

549
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:42,700
no,
no,

550
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:42,970
no,
no,

551
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,080
no,
no.

552
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,110
And so I,
and,

553
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,890
and it's,
it's like it's all,

554
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,110
it's almost like I didn't want to,
I wanted to tell it but I could figure 

555
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,990
it out to work it out,
but I didn't wanna have to deal with all

556
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,910
the fucking steps,
all the steps.

557
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,720
And I was like,
I'm like,

558
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,240
I'm not going to die on the hill right 
when I don't,

559
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,100
I don't really talk about race much in 
my act.

560
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,190
So I'm like,
I don't really,

561
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,900
I'm not going to die on that hill for 
that bit to do with a bit like that.

562
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:09,920
You gotta look at it as if you're 
someone trying to deconstruct it.

563
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,410
Like you're someone who's trying to 
attack that bit.

564
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,800
See for me a bit works best the very 
first time I do it and then and then 

565
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,640
every,
every,

566
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,710
every work in bid I do around that to 
like take it apart and figure out 

567
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:23,750
another way to approach it.

568
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,620
That's where I start fucking it up.
It's like the first time I say it I go,

569
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,480
Ooh,
let's hope we can find that again.

570
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,030
That's I'm the polar opposite.
Oh No.

571
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,730
Occasionally I'll say something good the
first time,

572
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,880
but most of the time when I say 
something that seems like a sprout or a 

573
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,100
seed and then I'm like,
okay,

574
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,760
but how much time do you spend listening
to recordings?

575
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,040
A lot.
A lot.

576
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,050
Now I look back to that last special.
I did it obsessive Lee and then I got 

577
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:53,861
into it.
I got into recording and now what I do 

578
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,471
is I will bid out if I don't have video 
like that video because I think the 

579
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,730
video aspect really lets me know why 
things were like I this bit where I,

580
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,330
my I do my eyes a little different and 
it was killing and I saw it on video and

581
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,650
Oh,
I gotta make sure to do that.

582
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,220
But um,
I,

583
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,800
for me it's like I,
it's almost like I'm always trying to 

584
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,130
chase to get back to that first time I 
told it that feeling.

585
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,270
Yeah.
I like to clip it out and then put 

586
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,270
chunks of like,
all right,

587
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,270
here's where the starbucks bid is,
here's this is.

588
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,680
And then look at the different ones and 
go,

589
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,080
oh,
why did that work better than this one?

590
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,580
But um,
but I'm also,

591
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:27,581
I've gotten really into editing videos 
and stuff so it's a lot easier for me 

592
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:27,920
than it was when I first started.
Now I'm just like,

593
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:29,090
oh,
real quick,

594
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,580
sync up audio and [inaudible].
I'll do audio and video,

595
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:36,581
different tracks.
Sync them up and then just clip them 

596
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:36,581
out,
put them in folders.

597
00:25:36,581 --> 00:25:37,190
Audio and video.
What do you mean?

598
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,590
What I do?
I got a little nerdy about it.

599
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,390
I take a h,
four,

600
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,280
six and eight.

601
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,910
Is that an audio recorder?
It's A.

602
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,950
It's a zoom recording.
Zoom h were six and then I'll take my 

603
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,110
camera,
put it in the back if I can or I'll have

604
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,820
the club run,
run video,

605
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,040
but I'd like to sync up clean audio and 
clean video.

606
00:25:55,041 --> 00:26:00,041
That way if I do have something fun,
like Hannibal got on stage with me the 

607
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:00,041
other night and I was like,
oh cool.

608
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:04,601
I got all this shit that's.
I could definitely put online if I'm 

609
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:04,601
going to want to do that.
The Hannibal,

610
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:07,340
I'd have to run it by him first,
but I got real clean audio of it.

611
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,820
Oh that's interesting.
So you are doing it through the 

612
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:12,820
soundboard?
No,

613
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,911
I do it through the h four slash six is 
like the best and I have a basically a 

614
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:17,910
surround sound mic on that.
Which ones are called the gun?

615
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,950
What?
H four slash six.

616
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:22,040
It's bigger than a zoom h four slash 
six.

617
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Right.
Am I right on that or is it just the 

618
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,400
eight?
Six?

619
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,400
I would say the h six.
It's a six.

620
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Eight,
six.

621
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,910
The other ones,
the h four n zoom,

622
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,060
zoom h six o them.
Yeah.

623
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,530
Audio recorder and it was big.
Is that thing?

624
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,200
It's about the size of.
It's about the size of this box,

625
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,640
but they make a zoo,
it looks like.

626
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah.
They make a zoom that's smaller that I 

627
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:43,840
take with me now.
That fits in my pocket,

628
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
like the size of a lighter.
That's really great.

629
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,260
Yeah.
Pull that up.

630
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,450
Let me see what that looks like.
What I like about doing it on my phone 

631
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,530
though is that I have them always with 
me all the time and then I sync it up in

632
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:59,531
my car on the way to the Gig.
That's what I did the other night to 

633
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:02,650
listen on the way there on the way out.
You go like that because I liked the.

634
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:07,430
I liked the puzzle solving aspect of 
putting together sets.

635
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,590
You know what I mean?
When you go like a man,

636
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:12,530
like why does this,
when I do it fourth it kills,

637
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:14,300
but if I do it fifth,
it's garbage.

638
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,790
You know,
like you try to like figure it out.

639
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,010
Well maybe this needs to be punched up.
Maybe they should move here.

640
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:21,050
I liked doing that.
I like figuring that out.

641
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Yeah.
And there's always those mystery 

642
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,080
punchlines that you didn't think were 
going to be a punchline and crushes.

643
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,120
Sure.
You know,

644
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:28,010
like what the fuck is,
what are you laughing at?

645
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,600
I don't get it.
Like what happened there

646
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,650
due to the time that you guys were in 
the back of the room and I said I used 

647
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,030
to think and Helen Keller the same 
person and I didn't think that was funny

648
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:42,031
at all.
And you're like please don't do that a 

649
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:42,031
bit.
And I was like,

650
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:42,031
no,
that was at a stand up on the spot,

651
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:45,610
on the spot.
I send them all the spots of the most 

652
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:45,610
useful thing.
Yeah.

653
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:45,610
Super.
Okay.

654
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:45,970
So which one is,
you've got the h six.

655
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I've got the H,
four n and then the h one n is the one 

656
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,850
that got that take with me.
The h six is the larger one.

657
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:56,851
That's like a Taser looking thing and 
then which is the one you take with you 

658
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:56,851
the one.
And that's really little.

659
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,680
What's the comparison in the sound 
between the h one,

660
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:03,370
N and h six.
A big jump in my opinion.

661
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

662
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:07,150
Jamie should be the same.
How?

663
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,180
So?
Uh,

664
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:09,210
I would,
it would be,

665
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,570
it should be the same microphones.
Uh,

666
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:13,610
the age six is just going to lie to do 
six tracks.

667
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:18,611
That's what the six is logistics inputs.
This was probably just one track or 

668
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:19,550
maybe it's too specific for this left 
and right.

669
00:28:19,551 --> 00:28:20,630
That's why there's two microphones.

670
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,540
Oh,
interesting.

671
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,600
That was a great mind.
I take that with me and you,

672
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,640
it shows you how much time you have.
You put a 64 gigabyte,

673
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,590
a mini SD card in and you get like 118 
hours of recording.

674
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,390
How's the.
So if you do,

675
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,790
I go through batteries pretty quick,
but if you use lithium batteries,

676
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,010
it's not that bad.
So you do mini

677
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,740
sd card,
you could take that mini SD card and put

678
00:28:40,741 --> 00:28:45,120
it if you have a phone.
Like I just got an android phone,

679
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,590
I got this,
a galaxy note nine and it has a,

680
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,610
it takes up to one terabyte of storage 
shit.

681
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,040
Look at the stars.
Is that new?

682
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,040
But it takes an SD card.
Yeah.

683
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,430
Shut the fuck up.
It takes an SD card.

684
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,760
It takes up to one terabyte of storage.
Um,

685
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,240
it's fucking phenomenal.
Just phenomenal.

686
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,950
They used to be that they were like way 
inferior to iphones.

687
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,720
It's not the case anymore.
In fact,

688
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,670
I think like,
look how big that screen is.

689
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,560
Yeah,
that's great.

690
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:17,160
Cup.
Ready?

691
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,710
Ready.
Who makes that a Samsung?

692
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,940
Let's see.
Um,

693
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,090
the,
the fingerprint reader is fucking 

694
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,370
instant.
And it as a pen we could write on the 

695
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,140
lock screen.
So on the lock screen you can take notes

696
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,260
and write on the screen.
I haven't written in my job fully and 

697
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:37,680
forever.
I feel like.

698
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Whoa.
You sure can.

699
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,890
And then you save those two you notes.
But yeah,

700
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,990
that's really cool.
And then this also works as a remote 

701
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:51,990
control.
So if you're playing music,

702
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,790
if you play music on this thing while 
you're playing music,

703
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,560
this will start and stop your music.

704
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,410
It's fucking funny.
I'm just going to stomp out your iphone 

705
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:02,410
right now.
I don't know man.

706
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,650
I'm trying to figure out what to do.
I've always had that same phone.

707
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,920
No,
but the other thing about the new iphone

708
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:09,980
that Jamie was telling me is that you 
can um,

709
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,560
you can have two different phone 
numbers.

710
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,550
Were you telling me that?
No,

711
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,610
Brian was,
you could have two different phone 

712
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:18,610
numbers and then one.
Yeah,

713
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:18,830
you can tell you what it tastes like a 
second card.

714
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,590
So say like if you have a business line 
and online,

715
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,870
right?
Then he'd take that Sim card out for the

716
00:30:23,871 --> 00:30:27,680
business line or you disabled the 
business line and you're like fuck you.

717
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
So say like if you have a phone that 
only like your best friends your wife 

718
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,660
have.
And then the next is like agents,

719
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:36,770
that other bullshit.
Yeah.

720
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,820
But you just set up a whole decoy number
for like people.

721
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:42,770
You don't want to have your number,
that's good.

722
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,830
But you can also do something like that 
with,

723
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,120
um,
what is that thing?

724
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:47,790
Um,

725
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,330
here's a

726
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,350
google voice,
right?

727
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,580
Doesn't google voice have some shit like
that.

728
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,870
You can have a separate,
that's that.

729
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,450
You can have that rerouted to your phone
number and have like a business line

730
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,750
kind of thing.
We'll look at this.

731
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,390
This thing works as remote control.
So check this out.

732
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,730
I'll crank it up.
You take pictures with it too,

733
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:09,070
right?
Yep.

734
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,060
Got It.

735
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,090
So you're using that.
Can Watch it.

736
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,760
See that?
Oppress it.

737
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,210
Yeah.

738
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,430
Box Cutter.
Patsy,

739
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,150
come on.

740
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,600
How many of those pens do you get?
Like 10.

741
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,550
No sticks.
Right in your book.

742
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,890
Fits in there.
Bank.

743
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,630
That's perfect at charges.
It's Bluetooth.

744
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,520
Nice.
Syncs up to your phone.

745
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,430
Maybe I'll get one of those guys a 
burner phone.

746
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,010
Well,
it's thousand dollars.

747
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,450
You wouldn't really want it as a burner 
phone.

748
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,240
Iphone.
Yeah.

749
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,980
I'm leaning towards it as my main phone.
I really am.

750
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,130
I mean,
I'm going to say the thing about the 

751
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,860
walled garden of iphones is you just get
used to that ecosystem.

752
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,300
Right now.
My,

753
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,470
my zone is all on my iphone.
This thing is still sweaty.

754
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,980
Touch it if you want to get my sweat.
Yeah,

755
00:31:58,981 --> 00:32:01,130
we don't want to drink something to see 
if I get that murdered sweat.

756
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,040
And inside me,
you just got to think like that.

757
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,170
Just good thing coming after someone you
love.

758
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:05,880
So wait,
let's,

759
00:32:05,881 --> 00:32:10,881
let's talk about um,
so for the month and for me,

760
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,360
he's going to think of that in itself.
Just going to think of that.

761
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,980
Think of rage.
I got,

762
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,190
I think a killing coyotes with my bare 
hands,

763
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,620
I think of,
I think all kinds of crazy.

764
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:25,720
She'll tell you what I'm going to.
I'm not even fucking around.

765
00:32:25,721 --> 00:32:30,721
I'm going to find my inner voice that 
speaks to me when I need that 

766
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:32,650
exclusivity.
Find your dark place.

767
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,930
That's easy access for me man.

768
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,010
So someone said,
uh,

769
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:50,011
why is it so,
why is it so difficult to tom for Tom 

770
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,030
Sober October?
Um,

771
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,910
he should take time off of thinking 
about murdering Baristas.

772
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,330
Have you guys don't know him and his 
wife had been doing this thing where you

773
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:03,170
guys had like,
if you murdered somebody,

774
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:07,610
which turned me into the cops.
She was like 100 percent and I was like,

775
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:09,530
are you out of your fucking mind?
She goes,

776
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,820
well,
was it an accident?

777
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:11,450
I'm like,
no,

778
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:16,451
I just told you that I killed somebody 
and I got the body in the trunk and no 

779
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:16,451
one knows.
She's like,

780
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,570
you're a psycho.
I don't know what you're going to do.

781
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:18,800
You're going to kill me next.
I'm like,

782
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,170
why would it kill you next?
She's like,

783
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,210
why'd you kill this guy?
I'm like,

784
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,450
because he pissed me off.
It's like,

785
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,350
it's like killed somebody today.

786
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,900
I get,
yeah,

787
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,460
that lady of content,
right?

788
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,070
So like got out of hand,
shouldn't have to go to jail forever.

789
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,360
You're my fucking ace,
right?

790
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:33,560
You're not going to turn me in.
She's like,

791
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,270
oh no,
you're unpredictable.

792
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:37,190
You can just ride or die.
That's what I thought.

793
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:42,370
Don't worry my ride or die.
You call me if you kill someone and got 

794
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,040
the shovel ready to take it to the next 
level.

795
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,460
If you come over with a body in the 
trunk and you go,

796
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:50,461
I got a body in the trunk,
I get the shovel and you come out and 

797
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:50,461
the body starts to get up out of the 
trunk.

798
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:51,280
I'll hit him with a shovel,
make sure he's dead.

799
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,520
WHATSAPP did.
Yeah,

800
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,590
that was a close call.
Where are we going?

801
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,870
We're going to go do lot,
much fun.

802
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,760
We'd have figuring out a place to go 
bury a body.

803
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,540
Yeah,
that'd be hard,

804
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,090
right?
Yeah.

805
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,010
I can tell you guys,
this is a conversation I wanted with her

806
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,890
and why wouldn't she do this with him?
And she's like,

807
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:09,200
I got babies now.
I fucking like,

808
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:10,220
all right.
Whatever.

809
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,380
Anyways,
I was just telling her,

810
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,460
she's like,
why did you kill the guy?

811
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:13,990
I was like,
alright,

812
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,960
let's just hypothetically say that on 
the ride of the desert called you a cunt

813
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:19,220
so I to kill him.
I killed.

814
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:24,221
The guy called me.
I told her that he fucked up my coffee 

815
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:24,740
cup.
That's definitely excusable.

816
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,520
She said,
she said if it's somebody like hurt the 

817
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:30,520
family or something,
she was like,

818
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,250
then it's 100 percent.
She goes,

819
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,540
but if you're like laying in,
wait,

820
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,960
just like premeditated hanging out like 
stalking people.

821
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,890
She goes,
Dad,

822
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:38,070
I got to turn you in.
And I'm like,

823
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,610
I still think that's bullshit.
Like you're my wife.

824
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,820
Why the fuck are you reading on me?
My wife would do the killing for me.

825
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,790
Someone broke into our house,
no questions asked.

826
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:51,791
I already know your wife had gun.
Somebody didn't give her the gun and 

827
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:51,791
your wife,
you think you tell her she,

828
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:52,550
she,
she'd be like,

829
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,700
alright,
you gotta go handle this.

830
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,980
I knew it was coming.

831
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,720
All guys prepping for this,
as long as you're nice to the kids,

832
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,540
they go,
oh yeah man.

833
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,290
It's what's crazy is that used to be 
super normal to kill people.

834
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,270
Like you mean like in the human history?
Oh yeah.

835
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,600
Two hundred years ago.
Yeah,

836
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,340
super normal people.
We have a president that killed somebody

837
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,050
or.
Yeah,

838
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,100
yeah,
it would be.

839
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,250
Imagine like,
um,

840
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,960
how normal though,
where it would be like,

841
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,590
it wouldn't even be worth bringing up 
that you killed somebody that day.

842
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,920
Right?
I mean,

843
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,740
if you go back far enough,
it's like,

844
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,840
yeah,
people are just stabbed and wait,

845
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,340
wait,
there's there's battles on.

846
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,800
Do you think they had their me too 
movement of,

847
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,760
of going like

848
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,440
killing people.
When did people just like totally 

849
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,951
stopped killing people?
I don't know how to be a movement where 

850
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:45,951
pure like,
guys,

851
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:48,480
my dad was murdered and no one cares and
your dad was murdered,

852
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:51,690
so can I kind of hurt me to hear this 
fucking sucks man.

853
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,060
To like the dark ages like coming out of
that.

854
00:35:54,061 --> 00:35:54,480
Oh No,
no,

855
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:56,490
no.
Dark Ages where you had no free will.

856
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,580
When I watch when that game of thrones,
when they cut his dick off and game of 

857
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,100
thrones,
it kicked,

858
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:05,130
clicked with a part of me where I went,
I helplessness.

859
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,840
The idea that you can't go,
this isn't fair.

860
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:09,030
You're not allowed to do that.
That helplessness.

861
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,620
It gave me a panic attack.
Think about that.

862
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:13,620
When you're on the treadmill,
son them cut my dick off.

863
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,590
Or You go cutting anybody's Dick.
Oh,

864
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,770
let's think of that feeling.

865
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,560
Just think of those kinds of people out 
there like helplessness.

866
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,080
You're tired.
You can't get away.

867
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,250
They,
when they bound,

868
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,970
I watched,
uh,

869
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:27,480
I watched the Marco Polo and thing and 
when they bound that little girl's feet.

870
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,100
Is that,
uh,

871
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,890
the Netflix?
Yeah,

872
00:36:28,891 --> 00:36:30,270
it was great.
I didn't watch that.

873
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,130
I watched like one or two episodes.
It seemed okay.

874
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,250
It was great and good.
Yeah.

875
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,510
Well,
yeah.

876
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,530
Well,
I like history.

877
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:35,730
I like anything history.
That's why I like,

878
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,060
like I used to have on Dan Dan Carlin 
history and so Marco Polo really new 

879
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:43,520
Kangaskhan apparently.
Yeah.

880
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,900
And so I think he knew gangas con son.
I think it's cooler.

881
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,290
Oh yeah,
yeah,

882
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:48,760
yeah.
You're right.

883
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,800
Yeah,
yeah,

884
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,300
yeah.
I like history.

885
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,610
I'm not a stickler for details.
So.

886
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,110
Well,
the cons,

887
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,050
you know,
the rain was a long time.

888
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,690
I mean they,
they,

889
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:05,090
during [inaudible] lifetime,
they estimated that he killed in his 

890
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,790
people killed 10 percent of the world's 
population.

891
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,820
God,
they killed so many people that change 

892
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,891
the carbon footprint of the world.
They literally change how many people 

893
00:37:12,891 --> 00:37:16,701
were burning things.
They literally changed it in core 

894
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,571
samples.
Like when you do a core sample on the 

895
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,611
earth,
the carbon footprint of human beings is 

896
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:25,401
less while he was alive because he 
killed one out of 10 human beings that 

897
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:26,240
lived.
So he was eco.

898
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:28,340
It was eco friendly for what he did.
Yes.

899
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,680
It's very greasy shit.
That's a weird thing that Dan Carlin 

900
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,720
goes over and his wrath of the con 
series,

901
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,420
which is like one of the greatest hits 
history series of all time.

902
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,070
Oh,
I can't recommend it enough.

903
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,080
I wish I could go back to the day I 
found it and I was like seven part 

904
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,300
series or whatever and I'd play it 
laying in bed,

905
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:50,301
fall asleep,
wake up and have to go find out where I 

906
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:50,301
left off.

907
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:50,301
So good and I'd have dreams of being a 
con.

908
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:54,360
I remember having a dream of learning 
how to shoot a of a page and in there we

909
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:56,070
had to wait for all four hooves off the 
ground.

910
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,140
I had a dream because I was listening to
it sleeping.

911
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,700
Dude.
I had the most fun.

912
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,660
I'm sorry.
Keep going.

913
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,230
No,
go ahead.

914
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,690
I had the most active.
What was it?

915
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,370
When you dream in your wake,
lucid I the most lucid fucking dream.

916
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:13,371
Last Night Vale most lucid dream.
I walked into this closet and I was.

917
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:16,830
I was on all fours and I go,
I'm not awake.

918
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,290
I think I'm dreaming.
And I went,

919
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,940
I am dreaming.
I said,

920
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,790
interesting.
And I sat criss cross applesauce.

921
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,800
I said,
I want a beautiful woman to walk in the 

922
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:27,800
closet and a beautiful woman walked into
the closet and I'm like,

923
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,680
I think I'm gonna.
Go down on her.

924
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,450
And I was like,
yeah,

925
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,920
this is a dream.
There's no cheating.

926
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,470
My wife's in Vietnam,
let's go down on her.

927
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,890
I started going down on her and I was 
like,

928
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,960
where's this leading?
I think I'm going to fuck her.

929
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,310
Fuck her.
And then I was like,

930
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,620
oh yeah,
we're fucking her.

931
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:42,490
And then I woke up.
I'm like,

932
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,140
God damn it.
I,

933
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:48,180
I wanted to stay back in it.
She didn't want to read the fucking 

934
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,350
biggest glitch.
Like a big black Dick.

935
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,280
He gets stuck in your throat.
I almost drowned.

936
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,210
What were you saying about the Dan 
Carlin saying?

937
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I don't remember.
Sorry.

938
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,970
It's okay.
Now you're going to access your rage 

939
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:13,970
from,
from,

940
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:13,970
uh,
you know,

941
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,200
from one of those moments.
Yeah.

942
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:19,201
Access.
You're raised thinking about how you 

943
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:19,250
couldn't fuck her and you sucked her.
Dick does a lot of rage.

944
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,480
Super upsetting.
Yeah.

945
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,060
I mean,
I used to do little tricks like that to 

946
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,190
get myself to work out harder.
That's why,

947
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,990
uh,
that's why I have those in my head.

948
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,210
That was like when I,
you know,

949
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,070
I just used to always feel like if,
if,

950
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,170
if the worst case scenario happened and 
you needed energy,

951
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,640
like how tired are you really?

952
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,650
Are you really tired?
Are you tired?

953
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:42,220
Like,
oh,

954
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:43,690
I'm tired.
I just need to stop.

955
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
Or are you tired?
Like,

956
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,250
I can't survive right now?
Or are you tired?

957
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:50,800
Like,
someone I loved dearly is in trouble and

958
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:51,850
I can't help them.
Like,

959
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,280
how tired are you?
Hmm.

960
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,910
Yeah.
That's.

961
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,160
Think of that different levels of tired 
for sure.

962
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,820
Yeah.
I'm going to put those things up 

963
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:02,820
everyday.
Motherfucker.

964
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,960
You're going to see those images of 
these workouts every day and I'm doing 

965
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:04,960
two a day.
You're going to work.

966
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,800
Do a day like that.
Yeah.

967
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,420
Me Too,
I already did mine today.

968
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:11,290
I walked three miles.
I'm going to do on that bullshit fucking

969
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,410
treadmill that we were talking about.
These stumps treadmill.

970
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:19,411
You don't like that dude.
It just is not enjoyable because it's 

971
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:19,411
hard.
It's hard as weight.

972
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,420
So that's the whole idea behind.
It's difficult to keep going for point 

973
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,420
total,
right?

974
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:24,820
Is that,
that's the move,

975
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:25,390
right?
Well,

976
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:26,230
I mean there was,
there was two,

977
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:31,260
like what are the other things?
The initial thought I had was like last 

978
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,410
year we had a,
it was 15 slash 20 minute hot yoga 

979
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,471
classes,
so the idea was I'm going to do those 

980
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:37,471
too.
Okay.

981
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:40,270
Well the idea for that was that it was 
difficult but attainable.

982
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,670
Right.
And you had to be disciplined to do it.

983
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,580
So now you're going to do two workouts a
day.

984
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,900
Yup.
And 15 minutes.

985
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,300
15 million account.
The Yoga is one.

986
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:49,960
That's the one.
Okay.

987
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:51,110
I'll work out today.
But.

988
00:40:51,111 --> 00:40:55,360
And then another hardcore.
I'm doing the 15 hot yoga classes on top

989
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:58,300
of all the other shit.
What is this number?

990
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:02,590
The one that's your calories burned.
Oh really?

991
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,180
That's what I said.
When you walked in,

992
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:06,520
I've never once been burned a thousand 
calories to workout,

993
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,000
so I take that bunch.
Yeah,

994
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,090
there's a lot.
What's a normal workout burn?

995
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,130
I mean,
if you're doing an intense one.

996
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,590
Oh,
here.

997
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,580
I'll show you.
I got a bunch of them locked in here.

998
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,580
It says 98 percent of my secondary job.
It's going to adjust.

999
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,050
Yeah,
because it's one 75.

1000
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Yeah,
it's going to drink is because I'm an 

1001
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,971
old fuck.
It just thinks my heart rate doesn't go 

1002
00:41:29,971 --> 00:41:31,100
that high anymore.
Here I'm on.

1003
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,980
The juice numbers starts to says like 
it's 2:20

1004
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,790
minus your age is your Max heart rate 
zone or something like that.

1005
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,310
Well that's not real.
So yeah,

1006
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:42,650
the older you are,
the lower your Max's.

1007
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,080
Well that's broken.
The Shit don't work,

1008
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:46,130
right?
I should be dead.

1009
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:49,150
This is where it should be.
I don't think that's like the year or.

1010
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,460
I did a workout a couple of days ago.
Sixty three minutes.

1011
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:56,090
Seventy two percent effort throughout.
Eight hundred 64 calories burned.

1012
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,580
That's a lot.
Eight hundred says yeah,

1013
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,020
that's a good workout.
Yeah.

1014
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,390
And then this one,
that was 62 minute workouts.

1015
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:02,990
I would you said?
Yeah,

1016
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,170
this was a 93 minute workout.
I burned 1300 calories.

1017
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,220
And a real.
Yeah,

1018
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,100
you could do that.
You can do that,

1019
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,940
but you'd have to go hog hole hall.
This was kickboxing.

1020
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,760
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1021
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:19,930
Oh yeah.
You did a 90 minute kickbox we did 

1022
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:19,930
kickboxing for part of it.

1023
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,500
And then you've got a trainer now?
Yeah.

1024
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Oh,
could you let Mr Tommy money bags a 

1025
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,380
couple of netflix specials.
Sell out a few theaters.

1026
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,630
He's not saying he's doing more than the
no theaters.

1027
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,670
Presold sale.
Sold out everything out.

1028
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,620
Everything.
When you move into arenas.

1029
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,440
Hey,
speaking of arenas,

1030
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,170
how was Toronto fucking insane?
What is it like in the.

1031
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,720
When you're doing 10,000
people,

1032
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:49,750
10,000,
600 people at the Scotia Bank or he was 

1033
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,880
the Air Canada Center at the UFC is back
there in December.

1034
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,560
I'm back.
They're easy to be like,

1035
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,400
oh,
one time I was here alone talking.

1036
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,620
And then you see it like filled for 
events like that.

1037
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:00,370
And that's where the fucking raptors 
play it.

1038
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,450
It's,
it's so ridiculous.

1039
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:07,570
It doesn't seem real,
but I got to say the show felt like as 

1040
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,520
intimate as a set at the store,
I'm not bullshitting.

1041
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,020
Yeah,
yeah,

1042
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,310
yeah.
It was,

1043
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,240
it was fucking nuts.

1044
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,290
So yeah.
Yeah,

1045
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:18,080
it was fucking easy peasy.
It was fun.

1046
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,740
I mean it was literally like any other 
set I was.

1047
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I was nervous that I wasn't nervous.
I was nervous that I was calm and I did 

1048
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,020
a lot of sets leading up to it.
Like when I did a,

1049
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,500
you know,
I constantly do sets,

1050
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:37,160
but I did like,
I did four sets Thursday night.

1051
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,200
Ideally.
Yeah,

1052
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,720
I did the ice house Wednesday,
so I did an hour plus the ice house.

1053
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:46,721
I did three sets on,
on Tuesday night.

1054
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:48,170
Yeah,
I mean that's.

1055
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,330
I think that's the key is you just gotta
do gotta be.

1056
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,260
Yeah.
You have to just do so many that you're,

1057
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,250
you're just just like working out.
You can't have any doubt.

1058
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,800
You gotta be in shape.
I just sent you a video.

1059
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:05,801
This is,
this shows you how ridiculous the crowd 

1060
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:05,801
booked,
but when you're a,

1061
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:09,160
but you're also getting used to arenas 
because you did a few now just weird 

1062
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,160
boozer fourth,
Rena,

1063
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,310
fourth,
maybe fifth.

1064
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:11,150
But did,
did.

1065
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:13,340
Um,
Columbus Vancouver.

1066
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,000
Did Columbus.
Did Kansas City.

1067
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,430
Kansas City was weird because outside.
That was weird.

1068
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,710
It was like an amphitheater,
right?

1069
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,650
Yeah.
Crazy.

1070
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,650
This was the biggest one.
This one was bananas.

1071
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,760
Wild Man.
I'm stressing top of are doing tours at 

1072
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,600
the exact same time next year and I'm 
stressing doing theaters 12.

1073
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:35,610
So $1,200
in the theater going like,

1074
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:38,580
fuck it.
How do you like it gets normal man after

1075
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:41,880
awhile.
But scooter scooter had dessert a couple

1076
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:43,560
of seconds and you can see it when I get
onstage,

1077
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,280
like,
like,

1078
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,840
like watch when they turn the lights on,
this is what's really strange

1079
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,640
when you get to look out over the entire
audience.

1080
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:59,800
Fucking ridiculous.
That's madness.

1081
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,920
That is that wild man do that.
Then there's the upper deck that doesn't

1082
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:09,810
seem real and it just happened.
And you,

1083
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,460
you did this and the same night a

1084
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,900
bird did the forum burdens.
Not 20,000,

1085
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:19,380
9,000,
the Western Forum,

1086
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,730
the Great Western Forum.
I don't know that it is the thing online

1087
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,760
that it was 20,000
people.

1088
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,050
They're wrong because Dean del Ray said 
it was 9,000.

1089
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,380
I think they just made a mistake but 
huge.

1090
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,370
Either way.
It's huge.

1091
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,020
So I was thinking last night,
I know you,

1092
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,750
I know that you're not like this,
I know you're a little bit like this,

1093
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,300
but to compare different times of 
comedy,

1094
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:37,300
right?
Um,

1095
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,330
and compare people.
I know you don't like comparing people,

1096
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:44,331
but has there ever been a time in comedy
where this many acts were selling 

1097
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:46,980
arenas?
This many acts were selling theaters and

1098
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,350
this maniacs we're selling out clubs.
I don't think so.

1099
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,240
He will.
Well,

1100
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:53,460
burrs sold out Madison Square Garden,
which is way bigger than that.

1101
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:55,650
Madison Square Garden I think is 
$18,000.

1102
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,300
How about this?
Sebastian is ready to sell for car.

1103
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,400
He's already sold out three.
He's opened up a fourth show at Madison 

1104
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,880
Square Garden.
Just stop and think about that.

1105
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:08,430
That's almost 80,000
people.

1106
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,290
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1107
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,930
That's like a fucking nfl game stadium 
at this time.

1108
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,980
Like just look at theater comics.
Just legit selling like multiple theater

1109
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:22,050
shows.
Eliza Dalea.

1110
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,860
You can name any of you myself,
like,

1111
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,980
Oh,
you go down the list.

1112
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:30,540
There's so many comics selling theaters,
theaters that I don't think there's ever

1113
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,620
been,
you know,

1114
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,630
there's never been a time like this.
Never.

1115
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:39,110
There's never been this many comics are 
settling out multiple thousand seat 

1116
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,801
places.
And then there's the big first of all 

1117
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:42,801
this Kevin Hart,
who's the biggest of the big.

1118
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:46,911
He sells out 50,000.
Carol Williams is actually a lot bigger 

1119
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:46,911
than he is.
Kat Williams.

1120
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,180
Oh yeah.
I watched it on the breakfast club.

1121
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,140
I'm joking.
I'm joking.

1122
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:55,330
Didn't he got Williams?
Just slamming potential.

1123
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,520
Pretty Fun.
I liked that.

1124
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,640
I liked,
I liked tattoos,

1125
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,300
but he's,
he's eccentric at best.

1126
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,240
Kevin is the biggest,
the biggest.

1127
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,990
It's the biggest monster.
So he's fit.

1128
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,730
He can sell 50,000.
He sold $50,000.

1129
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:09,560
Philadelphia when he did a special.
Yeah,

1130
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,660
there's only one of him,
but you know,

1131
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:15,390
it was real close to him that people 
forget about is Larry the cable guy?

1132
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:20,630
Because Larry,
the cable guy was selling out football 

1133
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,701
stadiums because Josh Wolfe was opening 
for him and Josh Wolfe took a picture 

1134
00:47:22,701 --> 00:47:22,830
and showed it to me and he goes,
dude,

1135
00:47:22,831 --> 00:47:25,380
this was me onstage opening up for Larry
the cable guy.

1136
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:26,760
And you're like,
yeah,

1137
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,440
yeah,
but people don't think about.

1138
00:47:28,441 --> 00:47:29,040
First of all,
Larry,

1139
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:34,050
the cable guy is the most humble.
Like plus he's doing that in like the 

1140
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,951
heartland.
So people will just dismiss it because 

1141
00:47:37,951 --> 00:47:38,770
it's not like an la show or so.

1142
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,060
Those two guys,
I think.

1143
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,730
I think Kevin Hart is Numero Uno.
He's number one.

1144
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,940
Yeah.
And then there's Chappelle could 

1145
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,310
basically do anything.
He sells out mass the forum,

1146
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,530
not the form of the Hollywood bowl.
A bowl.

1147
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

1148
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,840
That's huge.
What does that $20,000,

1149
00:47:55,660 --> 00:48:00,660
$20,000
is amphitheatre offers like left and 

1150
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:00,860
right.
And then they'll,

1151
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,420
you know,
they'll probably be like,

1152
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,400
Eh,
you do a show.

1153
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:05,740
It's like you'll get like $700,000,
be like,

1154
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:10,770
I'm going to do the belly room.
And then he just goes and does that 

1155
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:10,950
because he likes it.
He likes the intimate shows.

1156
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,010
Well,
he's also,

1157
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,310
I hate to use a term like this,
but he's a legitimate artist.

1158
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,170
He's just trying to do better work to 
better comedy and always evolve it.

1159
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:25,350
He's one of the rare guys that could do 
a special and then the next week 11 new 

1160
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:25,350
our.
Yeah,

1161
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,020
and somehow it comes out works.

1162
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,350
I know.
I mean he's just supremely dedicated,

1163
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,210
you know?
Yeah.

1164
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:35,940
So there's him,
there's Chris Rock can still sell out 

1165
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,030
pretty big places.
If Louis came back,

1166
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:42,031
I think he could sell out giant places.
Giant burst sells out everywhere he 

1167
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:44,620
wants to burke and sell out.
He sold out Boston Garden,

1168
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:48,580
which is 18,000
wells fargo center in Philly.

1169
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,530
How big is that?
15,000.

1170
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,730
Yeah,
that's crazy.

1171
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,520
He could sell out all those places.
It's really hard to put in perspective,

1172
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,900
and I think you guys can understand 
this,

1173
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:58,840
but I mean you were selling out clubs 
what,

1174
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:01,480
like six,
17 years ago.

1175
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,880
Were you just doing clubs?
Yeah,

1176
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:05,170
for sure,
but when you were,

1177
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,530
when you were selling them,
when you were selling out just clubs,

1178
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,800
that's an achievement in this business 
to sell out weekends and ad shows is a 

1179
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,971
login achievement that so undermined 
when you go in and use San Jose or you 

1180
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:18,760
do whatever.

1181
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,910
You sell out everything and then go,
oh my God,

1182
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,620
like Holy Shit.
Like there's,

1183
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,410
there's.
So the possibilities are endless.

1184
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,180
Well,
it's the Internet.

1185
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:29,830
It's,
that's what it is.

1186
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:34,831
It's people.
And then there's like this network of 

1187
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:36,820
comics now that everybody knows about,
you know,

1188
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:39,440
if you know about bill,
you know about Joey Diaz,

1189
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:40,480
you know about you,
you know,

1190
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:45,550
but there's this thing going on now 
where everyone's sort of connected 

1191
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,730
that's never existed before.
And then a lot of these people,

1192
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,130
not Sebastian,
he's one of the rare ones that doesn't.

1193
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,620
But most of these people have podcasts.
Kevin Hart doesn't obviously,

1194
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,710
but Kevin Hart has major movies.
Sebastian actually does one.

1195
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,790
He does a podcast.
I didn't even know,

1196
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,830
but I don't think they,
I don't think he can get to it like 

1197
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:07,980
weekly,
but they definitely considered serious 

1198
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:07,980
thinking to do it specifically for 
serious.

1199
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,160
Does it?
Whenever you can get to it.

1200
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,490
Think so.
I think you've probably been,

1201
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:13,780
you've been in this longest of the three
of us,

1202
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:18,220
but have you ever known a time in comedy
when comics were more friendly?

1203
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:20,500
Like it seems like everyone's on the 
same team.

1204
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:20,950
Yeah.
Yeah,

1205
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:22,750
yeah.
This is a completely different thing.

1206
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,760
I've talked about this before.
It's because I really believe it's 

1207
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,120
because the internet and also because 
there's

1208
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,070
no,
um,

1209
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,300
things were fighting for anymore.
Like tonight show spots are stupid shit 

1210
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,321
like that or Sitcom auditions.
But in the past it was like there was 

1211
00:50:38,321 --> 00:50:42,101
three channels and there was the tonight
show and the letterman show and 

1212
00:50:42,101 --> 00:50:42,710
everybody wanted to host the tonight 
show,

1213
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:47,711
but Jay Leno was hosting it forever or 
Johnny Carson before him and there was 

1214
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,551
this competition between comics when 
they were just cut throat and there's 

1215
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,630
not that anymore now instead,
like radio shows,

1216
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:59,631
right?
Radio shows always shit on the other 

1217
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:02,261
radio shows always.
They always saw other morning shows in 

1218
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:02,261
town.
They shit on him.

1219
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:03,500
It was all shitting on.
Everybody fucked them.

1220
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:05,810
Like Howard stern was notorious for it.
Yeah.

1221
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:08,450
We do the opposite.
Start wars for ratings.

1222
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,190
Yeah,
but we do the opposite.

1223
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,400
We all have successful podcast,
but we all have each other on our 

1224
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,550
podcasts.
We're all super friendly about it.

1225
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,160
We all promote each other's specials.
We all,

1226
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,400
we all hang out together.
Like there's a camaraderie amongst 

1227
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,791
comedians now.
It used to be like there might be some 

1228
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:28,370
comradery amongst a couple,
but it would always go bad.

1229
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,660
You know,
that there was never like bunch of real 

1230
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,700
headliners hanging out together like 
they are now.

1231
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:35,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1232
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:40,150
I mean even the simplest things like 
Dalea does something funny and I'll just

1233
00:51:40,151 --> 00:51:45,151
put it,
I'll talk about it all my open tabs and 

1234
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:45,910
get like half a million views and then 
you just go like I deleted.

1235
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:51,050
It might be one of my favorite people to
watch these days because I just watched 

1236
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:51,070
his instagram will go,
what's he doing today?

1237
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:56,130
He's ridiculous.
I can totally talk about it all my open 

1238
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,130
tabs and just share it with everyone.
I just go,

1239
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,130
oh,
great.

1240
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,650
Bernie shop.
But like,

1241
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:59,260
dude,
it's been funny shit.

1242
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,790
Dean del Ray Singh.
Yeah,

1243
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,550
I saw you posted that up.
It's got.

1244
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,800
Okay.
So I put that on my instagram is another

1245
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:11,801
good example.
I put that on my instagram and it's got 

1246
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:11,801
like 700,000
unique.

1247
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:15,500
It really saying fuck him.
Like he can really sing like what?

1248
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,510
Like wait a minute,
I didn't know you could do that.

1249
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:17,930
Yeah,

1250
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:24,820
it's got 670,000
days living his best life man.

1251
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:14,890
I told

1252
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,600
them,
I go send me the whole fucking video,

1253
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:17,160
man,
you,

1254
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,190
you.
I go,

1255
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,890
you're a fucking murder a man.
He's an inspiration man.

1256
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,090
He didn't,
he did Conan tonight.

1257
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,100
I did Conan and he was so excited and it
was so amazing to like burst showed

1258
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,320
up.
Everyone was in the back of the room and

1259
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:28,950
he came off.
He was like,

1260
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:31,400
that's my first late night as well and I
think Dean's 50.

1261
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:36,590
You got to respect it though.
He just started stand up like 46 or 

1262
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:36,590
something.
Something like that.

1263
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:36,960
Yeah.
It's very.

1264
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:38,250
It's not.
It's not common.

1265
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,670
It's not common to stick with it and 
keep getting better at it.

1266
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,250
It was so cool to be on the end of Kona 
with him.

1267
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,380
Marin,
Marin and dean.

1268
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,370
Just three comics and that's booking,
but there's no celebrity.

1269
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:55,450
It's just three comics and deans.
The only one that did stand up and just 

1270
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:55,500
like,
oh fuck.

1271
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:56,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1272
00:53:56,341 --> 00:54:01,341
That's what I saw someone said it was.
It felt like the green room at the main 

1273
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:01,670
room and the comedy store.
Burrs limit.

1274
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,330
Let me tell you something.
I.

1275
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,040
Burr Bill Burr is living as best fucking
life right now.

1276
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,010
He does these when he does the garden or
when he does the forum,

1277
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:13,370
they come in with the goddamn comedy jam
and set up a thing and they do a full 

1278
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,670
concert to an empty venue before the 
show.

1279
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,070
They just do it for themselves.
They just want to play the forum.

1280
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,510
He'll tell me he played from two to 
6:30.

1281
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,240
Really?
Yeah,

1282
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,500
just played all day,
so I was exhausted.

1283
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:26,070
He was.
I was worried.

1284
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:28,320
I was too tired to do the show.
Hilarious.

1285
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,190
But that's how much fun he is having 
done.

1286
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,240
Do.
What would you do if you did like would 

1287
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,240
you set up a football game and football?
Yeah.

1288
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,330
What would you do,
man?

1289
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,740
I mean,
I would watch one.

1290
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,310
I would just invite people to come watch
a game.

1291
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:46,340
That means fucking flying helicopters.
Playing drums.

1292
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,760
I mean,
yeah.

1293
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,260
Yeah.
No,

1294
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:50,370
he's not.
This is an interesting time,

1295
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:55,550
but this is also.
It shows you that because of all this 

1296
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,190
camaraderie and that everybody's doing 
really well,

1297
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,290
it shows you that that's possible,
that these,

1298
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,780
the old way of looking at things as the 
wrong way.

1299
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:08,860
Yeah,
that's a selfish famine thinking way 

1300
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:08,860
wrong.
Well,

1301
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,170
hire a Dj to bring me out to an event 
like that though.

1302
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:14,370
If I was doing an arena.
Really does that.

1303
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,410
I think Chappelle does that.
Russell brought out a MC Shan out on,

1304
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:24,850
always brings on stage to all his white 
audience and he freestyled the use all 

1305
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,400
the breaks and all the white people just
sat there staring at Russell and Russell

1306
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,120
was like,
are you fucking kidding me?

1307
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:35,690
He's.
He brings like old school legends 

1308
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:35,690
everywhere.
Well,

1309
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:39,500
he,
he'll do a gig and then after a gig 

1310
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:39,500
he'll go to a club and DJ.
Yeah,

1311
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,090
he will.
He can actually Dj to real dj DJ records

1312
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:44,340
and scratching and all that stuff.
He knows his shit.

1313
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,410
He gets mad at those electronic music 
guys would call themselves Djs,

1314
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,580
DJ,
Dj.

1315
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,070
He's goes back like,
you got to be able to get vinyl.

1316
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:54,870
Dig through the crates.
Yeah.

1317
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:55,590
Flip it around.
Yeah,

1318
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,610
yeah,
yeah.

1319
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,570
No,
he knows his stuff,

1320
00:55:57,571 --> 00:55:58,440
man.
He really does.

1321
00:55:58,620 --> 00:55:59,850
Well,
he's another one that sells out.

1322
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:02,760
He's at that other place.
A place that I was at in November.

1323
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:03,960
Really?
Yeah.

1324
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:05,780
He's at the Scotia Bank.
He's done that.

1325
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,630
A bunch.
Hometown selling out giant places.

1326
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:13,230
There's so much of that going on with 
his seven time doing that too.

1327
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,300
Oh yeah.
At least it's overwhelming,

1328
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,040
man.
It really is,

1329
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:16,540
and I,
I,

1330
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,050
you know what it is.
I had a guy say to me one time,

1331
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:22,430
and I think this is what it is.
I had a guy come up to me at West Palm,

1332
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,890
was doing a New Year's eve

1333
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:28,450
drunk as fuck.
Both of us probably were both shirtless.

1334
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,890
I'm doing the meet and greet and he 
goes,

1335
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:30,520
ah.
He goes,

1336
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:35,521
I need to talk to you for like two 
minutes and the artist is that you 

1337
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:35,521
wanted to fuck,
you know,

1338
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:36,600
I get this a lot.
I get,

1339
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,360
I'm good.
Thanks.

1340
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,460
I'm done.
He agreed,

1341
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,260
and so I go there like,
sir,

1342
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,710
you got to move along and give them two 
minutes.

1343
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:45,730
And he's like,
he's like,

1344
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:47,320
dude,
I'm a fan.

1345
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,550
Do you know what that means?
I was like,

1346
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:49,090
hey.
And he goes,

1347
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:49,300
no,
no,

1348
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:49,630
no,
no,

1349
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,180
you're not listening to me when you do.
Well,

1350
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,680
I get happy.
He's like,

1351
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:55,750
it makes me happy to see good things 
happen to you.

1352
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:57,670
I will always be a fan,
will always support you.

1353
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:58,720
And I,
as soon as he said that,

1354
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:01,030
I thought it sounds super silly,
but I'm.

1355
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,200
Before I met you,
I was a fan like when you,

1356
00:57:03,201 --> 00:57:05,200
when that,
when the Carlos stuff went down,

1357
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,530
I got,
I've got behind your back and I was 

1358
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:10,530
like,
I'm a fan of Joe's.

1359
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:10,530
I like what he's doing that he's 
standing up for me.

1360
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:15,480
And in a weird way,
being a fan of something so fucking fun 

1361
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,750
when you become a fan and I think what 
podcasts have done is allowed you to 

1362
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,490
enter by become intimate with your fans 
and they support you in a way.

1363
00:57:21,491 --> 00:57:24,520
Like people go out and they see a video 
of dns singing and they go,

1364
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,600
oh yeah,
I'm happy.

1365
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,210
We're all happy for him when you do 
10,000

1366
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,200
seats,
I think there are people going,

1367
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,300
fuck yeah man,
my guys winning.

1368
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,340
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

1369
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,410
no,
I know what you're saying.

1370
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,630
Yeah.
I think we're fans of each other too.

1371
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,250
That's big too.
They also,

1372
00:57:37,251 --> 00:57:38,510
people realize like,
hey,

1373
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:43,570
like you can be a fan of someone.
It doesn't mean that somehow or another 

1374
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,050
you're a lesser person.
You know what I mean?

1375
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:49,400
Like I'm sure bill burr is a fan of 
Chappelle.

1376
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,620
I'm sure Chappelle's a fan of Chris 
Rock,

1377
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,980
like people are fans of other people's 
art.

1378
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,340
Whereas I think in the past that wasn't 
the case.

1379
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,230
It was not.
It was about separate camps.

1380
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,070
Yeah.
I was like,

1381
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,800
I'm in this year on that side,
which is so dumb,

1382
00:58:03,801 --> 00:58:05,300
so dumb.
Because you can also,

1383
00:58:05,301 --> 00:58:06,610
it's like,
you know,

1384
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:09,800
you can like,
you can like one type of music the most,

1385
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,890
but still enjoy other music that when 
the Internet opened up all these 

1386
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,560
possibilities,
that's when it happened.

1387
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:18,380
Probably seems like it to me.
I think it was podcasting.

1388
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,040
Yes.

1389
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,980
Like pea pod casting,
I guess.

1390
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:21,700
Yeah.
That is the Internet.

1391
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,720
I'm sorry,
I was thinking of Youtube for some 

1392
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,111
reason,
but like can you imagine dice and 

1393
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:28,111
kinison they hated each other.
Hated each other.

1394
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:28,900
That was the way it works.

1395
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:30,760
That was the bullet hole at the store.
Oh,

1396
00:58:30,761 --> 00:58:35,761
the belly room store.
Sam kinison brought a gun and shot the 

1397
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:39,421
fucking sign to let dice.
Now that he was going to fucking shoot 

1398
00:58:39,421 --> 00:58:40,330
him.
He didn't just pull out a gun.

1399
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:42,730
He pulled out a gun and shot a fucking 
sign.

1400
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,900
It's really crazy.
Yeah.

1401
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,660
They just fixed it a few years ago.
I was mad when they fix it.

1402
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:49,210
I'll fix that.
Yeah.

1403
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,350
It's really crazy though.
Yeah,

1404
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,700
got it.
I got to start doing that to you,

1405
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:57,710
burt.
Just shooting guns and guns and guns on 

1406
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:57,710
name.
Shoot it and shoot designed.

1407
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,530
Yeah,
but I think those guys were doing co two

1408
00:58:59,531 --> 00:59:04,531
and we smoked pot.
That's way different ingredients to this

1409
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:06,640
whole thing.
He smoked pot.

1410
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:08,280
You want to hug people,
you do coke.

1411
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:08,980
You like,
you want to fight,

1412
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:10,350
bro?
Fuck you up.

1413
00:59:10,351 --> 00:59:11,860
I'll hold you down.
I'll fuck your mouth.

1414
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,730
Fuck your mother.
Fuck your mothers.

1415
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,590
Mother fucker.
Bones.

1416
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,580
That'll start a business.
Yeah.

1417
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,450
It's um,
it's also,

1418
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,840
there was everyone's scratching and 
clawing.

1419
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:30,350
There wasn't a lot of opportunities.
I think it's the pot tooth though.

1420
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,030
I think it's like guys like Diaz as an 
Ren,

1421
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,350
you and me,
like there's a different sensibility.

1422
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,500
There's like a,
a more generous sensibility.

1423
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,260
I think.
So give me an.

1424
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,560
I think it's everything for me.
I'm,

1425
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:50,020
I'm big.
I'm big on generosity and I'm big on 

1426
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:53,621
support.
I think you have to do that with people 

1427
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:53,621
around you.
You become contagious too.

1428
00:59:53,621 --> 00:59:53,950
Yeah.
You know,

1429
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,870
when you have it done to you,
you want to do it for others for sure.

1430
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,280
Yeah.
It's giant.

1431
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,560
Yeah.
Help out opening acts.

1432
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:03,200
Help out other comments.
And as you rise up,

1433
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:08,201
they'll do the same.
They'll do the same for the other guys 

1434
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:10,420
and you see them doing that for a little
start taking guys with them on the road 

1435
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:10,420
and around.

1436
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:10,640
Look,
Ben,

1437
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,500
who do we like more than comics and 
where?

1438
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:17,540
What do you,
who do you want to hang out with more 

1439
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:17,540
than comedians?
You know,

1440
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,650
there were the most fun for us to hang 
out with what we could say ridiculous 

1441
01:00:20,961 --> 01:00:23,440
shit and then we'll laugh at it.
We won't like.

1442
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:24,860
Well,
I don't know why it said that.

1443
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:29,861
Tommy,
you shouldn't have called that lady at 

1444
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:29,861
con.
Especially not at friend.

1445
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:29,861
And then,
you know,

1446
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:33,731
I think you owe or a sauna and apology.
I mean if I was on I would've clocked 

1447
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:33,731
you.
Yeah.

1448
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,240
Yeah.
It's like the people wouldn't think it's

1449
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:36,080
funny.
Of course,

1450
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,330
if you were working at Xerox and he said
all that people would,

1451
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,490
you know,
they'd bring you into your liability.

1452
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:42,240
We've got to let you go.
Got to go.

1453
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,040
It's true.
I know when those are the worst people 

1454
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,040
that get stuck at a dinner with or 
something,

1455
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:48,590
you know,
you're like,

1456
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,550
oh shit.
You just torture him.

1457
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:52,610
Yeah.
It's the worst.

1458
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:57,730
Yeah,
I used to feel terrible when I was 

1459
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,621
around those people.
I used to feel like there's something 

1460
01:00:59,621 --> 01:00:59,621
wrong with me.
Yeah,

1461
01:00:59,621 --> 01:00:59,621
because yeah,
of course.

1462
01:00:59,621 --> 01:01:04,270
Real stuck up super conservative people.
I would just think there's something 

1463
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:05,720
wrong with me.
Why do I think this way?

1464
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,820
Why do I always want to say the 
inappropriate thing?

1465
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,180
It's like a muscle twitch.
Go.

1466
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,190
Just see how far you can make it a 
course.

1467
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,450
You start talking,
be in a foot race.

1468
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,660
Oh my God.

1469
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,090
You just see eyes widen and they're 
like,

1470
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:24,510
yeah,
you're like,

1471
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:26,600
dude,
we're not at a seminar right now,

1472
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,150
and that's what's bullshit about 
seminars.

1473
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,050
Yeah,
I mean,

1474
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,600
imagine if you were in the world of 
business.

1475
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,720
See,
I really think this is one of the 

1476
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:37,720
reasons why so many people are so fucked
up.

1477
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,400
It's so depressed.
I think the world of showing to,

1478
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,540
showing up to a place and then having 
your behavior limited into this very 

1479
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:48,761
narrow and rigid parameters all day long
and your livelihood and your success of 

1480
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:54,191
your,
your family and whether or not you can 

1481
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:56,291
send your kids to a good school.
All that dependent upon whether or not 

1482
01:01:56,291 --> 01:02:00,191
you're willing to play the rules,
you have to wear an outfit with a suit 

1483
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,641
and tie because if you don't,
you might be unpredictable and you show 

1484
01:02:03,641 --> 01:02:04,280
up with that t shirt on.
He's got a football shirt on at work.

1485
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,760
What the fuck is he drunk?
What is crazy?

1486
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,230
He's doing drugs.
You can't

1487
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,240
little join around people that don't 
just like joints around people crashed.

1488
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,980
Tesla's stock

1489
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,230
by $9,000,000,000
or some stupid shit.

1490
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,790
So crazy.
Yeah,

1491
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:27,960
but not really.
It bounced right back into that world.

1492
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:29,580
Like the guy can't.
First of all,

1493
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:32,000
we were drinking whisky.
Okay.

1494
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:35,220
No one has a problem with that,
which is way more of a hard drug.

1495
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,860
Way more of a crazy drug than a little 
puff of a joint.

1496
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:39,810
We were drinking whiskey.
No one cared.

1497
01:02:39,811 --> 01:02:42,090
We drank whiskey for three hours.
No one cared.

1498
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,970
Smoked a little joint.
Oh,

1499
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,240
let you think.
He inhaled it.

1500
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,180
Didn't look like it didn't look like it 
just took a ninth grader.

1501
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,560
He didn't know what to do.
It took a little puff.

1502
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,860
You know,
new kid at school just gets.

1503
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,900
Everyone just wants to do it too.
No bad.

1504
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,580
Yeah.
Fascinating.

1505
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,790
Yeah,
it was crazy.

1506
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,510
He didn't.
I mean another layer of it.

1507
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:04,470
He did it in California.
Exactly.

1508
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,710
Totally.
Totally legal.

1509
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:07,830
Yeah.
It's no different than having that class

1510
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:08,700
of whiskey.
You know,

1511
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:11,070
California said you could fly with it.
Now what?

1512
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:12,960
Lex said,
you could have an ounce of weed with you

1513
01:03:12,961 --> 01:03:14,020
on the airplane.
They said,

1514
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:16,860
we don't know what the fuck's going to 
happen when you land somewhere where you

1515
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,600
can go through lax with an ounce of 
weed.

1516
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,190
I'm sorry.
By the way,

1517
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:22,920
I looked up private suite after I talked
to you.

1518
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:25,320
Super expensive.
So expensive,

1519
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:26,220
stupid,
expensive.

1520
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:28,230
How did you know about it?
Sam Harris?

1521
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,660
He told me about it.
Yeah.

1522
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:30,120
Yeah,
Mike.

1523
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:35,390
I like people.
I don't mind going to the airport and 

1524
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:35,430
saying hi to people that that thing is 
like $7,000

1525
01:03:35,431 --> 01:03:37,050
a flight.
It's pretty.

1526
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:38,800
It was wild trivia.
No,

1527
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,920
no,
I think it was $3,000.

1528
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,960
It's a membership.
I thought the membership was it and 

1529
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:45,960
they're like,
membership gets you,

1530
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,970
so you pay 4,500
to be a member and then $2,700

1531
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:55,971
for a domestic flight per flight for 
like your own entrance.

1532
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,570
Uh,
you know,

1533
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:03,320
whatever your own meals you're on,
check in your own a Tsa Room.

1534
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,880
You hang out and make it sounded cool 
for like,

1535
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,720
like a family vacation or something.
You know,

1536
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:09,990
if you're Chris Pratt,
it's definitely makes sense.

1537
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1538
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:12,240
Summer,
a list,

1539
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:14,190
actor type person who shouldn't go 
anywhere.

1540
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:15,390
Yeah,
if you're Tom Cruise.

1541
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:16,770
But he said,
but those guys,

1542
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:18,150
they have to fly private.
They do.

1543
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:19,940
They own their own planes.
Most of them,

1544
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,640
you know,
they get.

1545
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,880
There's some article online about John 
Travolta's yacht pull up John Travolta's

1546
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:29,040
yacht.
It's probably got a bet if you went over

1547
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,690
that fucking thing with a black light.

1548
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,920
It was level like a Jackson pollock 
painting.

1549
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:42,150
Just pretty fucking splatters Jesus just
got a new yet everywhere.

1550
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:46,680
Apparently by the cabin boy.
This place really is lightened up.

1551
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,830
Boy Place.
Got Five locks on the door,

1552
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,500
lock bolts on the inside.
I'm outside.

1553
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:00,150
All the deckhands are really worn out 
here.

1554
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:05,151
Yes.
You have very weird latex outfits for 

1555
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:05,151
them to where?
Oh yeah.

1556
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,620
It's the money that that fucking guy 
must have.

1557
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:12,710
God,
he's got his own jet and he has his own 

1558
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:13,070
jet jet.
He has a seven.

1559
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,100
40 seven?
Yeah.

1560
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,480
Seven 47.
Yes.

1561
01:05:15,481 --> 01:05:17,980
And he has a runway and his for.
He

1562
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,980
has like multiple planes,
like look at that full story behind 

1563
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:25,270
Toronto's private jet fleet.
Like he's got his arm out the window.

1564
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,450
It flies to the window.
Fucking commercial plane.

1565
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,390
Yeah.
In the back room is just.

1566
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:34,000
It's all like a slip and slide with baby
oil.

1567
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,940
I look at that.
Look how many you have got multiple 

1568
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:44,880
gulfstreams.
If he flew for Quantus as a commercial 

1569
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,430
pilot.
He did.

1570
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,740
Yes.
He.

1571
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,780
They actually let him flop.
He's that good of a pilot.

1572
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:54,810
Wow.
That I think he has some sort of 

1573
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,521
commercial standing with Quantas.
He has a military jet just in case 

1574
01:05:56,521 --> 01:06:00,841
someone calls Homo flies over and flux.
That's really crazy.

1575
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,060
Mad at him asking to get a hand job at a
massage.

1576
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,430
See?
Yeah.

1577
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,710
That's.
It's funny stories about it,

1578
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:12,790
but this hash tag baller.
Holy Shit.

1579
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:14,370
Yeah.
That is bawling.

1580
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,500
That's a crazy man.
I mean that's like $100,000,000

1581
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:18,980
yacht right there.
Where,

1582
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,050
where did he make all his money?

1583
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:27,220
I mean,
how much money do you make from like 

1584
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,631
pulp fiction hit that one.
That would be about being a Russian spy 

1585
01:06:28,631 --> 01:06:29,030
or teaching or his forte,
you know,

1586
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:31,730
like his,
like his wealth,

1587
01:06:31,731 --> 01:06:33,350
wealth,
wasn't he?

1588
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,490
He'd kind of depleted when pulp fiction 
was like around [inaudible] 93.

1589
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,330
Yeah.
And then that made him so famous and hot

1590
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,550
again that he was just,
he was a $20,000,000

1591
01:06:43,551 --> 01:06:46,890
movie guy for for a while.
That was lasting face off.

1592
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:48,690
Yeah.
All those days off.

1593
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,520
So he's.
But he's doing terrible movies now.

1594
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:53,530
Yeah.
Izzy?

1595
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,320
Yeah.
You did that movie.

1596
01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:00,430
It's supposed to be.
We should probably have a fight 

1597
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:00,430
companion for God.
I heard it was really bad.

1598
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:01,350
I've heard it's so bad.
You wish.

1599
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:04,550
Do you wish to do November rolls around?
We can get drunk again.

1600
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:04,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1601
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,670
That's good.
That hammered and watch this God movie.

1602
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:10,040
It's supposed to be a wretched sack of 
shit.

1603
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,340
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

1604
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:13,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

1605
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:15,560
We'll do that because we've been being 
to do that.

1606
01:07:15,561 --> 01:07:17,840
What was the other terrible movie we're 
meaning to do that with?

1607
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:20,120
I have it on his head.
Auror that movie about.

1608
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:21,260
Well,
that's right.

1609
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:26,590
That's right.
There was a movie where a guy who was a 

1610
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,911
lion trainer actually made a movie with 
lions and a bunch of people that were 

1611
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:29,210
making the thing.
Oh,

1612
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,890
play the play the clip.
Let's hear the clip.

1613
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:34,730
Hmm?
Nah,

1614
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:40,070
hold on.
Do you have the wrong music plan that 

1615
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:42,430
this is.
This is a scene slash trailer from 

1616
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:42,430
Godaddy.

1617
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:46,970
Say That on the cover of the paper.

1618
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:48,270
Wait a minute.
Music.

1619
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:52,670
The music is really the sting song.
That's how it was.

1620
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:55,010
Pizza Shit movie.
This is the trailer sucks.

1621
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:57,200
Look at this as like an acting class.
Good.

1622
01:07:57,201 --> 01:07:57,890
Let it play out.

1623
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:59,130
Oh,
hold on a second.

1624
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:00,180
I'm sure to pull the audio off.

1625
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:06,310
Oh,
well we'll do Youtube Yankees for the 

1626
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:06,310
audio.
You look at them.

1627
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,280
There's a look.
So fake.

1628
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,300
No.

1629
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:23,780
Okay.
Kill it.

1630
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,690
We can't do this.
This is so bad,

1631
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:30,740
I can't even do a mobster anymore.
It's like it feels like a joke to play.

1632
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,660
You could do it,
but it would have to be like,

1633
01:08:34,661 --> 01:08:37,510
do you have to be authentic James 
Gandolfini back to life.

1634
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,940
Like if James Gandolfini was alive 
today,

1635
01:08:39,941 --> 01:08:41,520
he could be a movie.
Yeah,

1636
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,820
sure.
Because you believed it,

1637
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:44,170
right?
It's got to be authentic.

1638
01:08:44,171 --> 01:08:45,370
Yeah.
You'd believe it,

1639
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,150
but he gotta be.
It's gotta be done.

1640
01:08:49,151 --> 01:08:49,990
I mean,
Scorsese,

1641
01:08:49,991 --> 01:08:52,150
you could probably do it again,
like it's just.

1642
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:57,690
There's just a bunch of people.
He's got a new one coming when he's 

1643
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:57,690
playing young.
God,

1644
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:57,970
he just looks like a grown up.
Danny Zuko.

1645
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:01,650
Hey.
Apparently Danny,

1646
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,450
Danny in the greasers tell you what,
man.

1647
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,110
After the sopranos came on the air,
everybody wanted to be Italian.

1648
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:13,140
It was one of those gross moments in 
time where all these Italians were like 

1649
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,330
empowered and they were all talking like
goon Baas and they,

1650
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:21,331
they,
they all wanted to fucking get together 

1651
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:23,170
and have pasta on old pecan pies.
Like ramped it up,

1652
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:28,400
say Matsuura.
Most of them started doing the hand 

1653
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,521
gestures,
like the guys come out of that going on 

1654
01:09:32,521 --> 01:09:32,590
and you know,
as a person who's legitimately Italian,

1655
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:36,610
it was disgusting.
You fucking apes.

1656
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:38,920
Are you doing?
Yeah,

1657
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:39,400
you,
he's,

1658
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:40,780
yeah.
They ramped it up,

1659
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:42,970
you know,
and then like Greek people are like,

1660
01:09:42,971 --> 01:09:47,971
I'm a Italian.
Start pretending that they're designed 

1661
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:47,971
for sure.
It was,

1662
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:49,990
you know,
there was a time where there was so many

1663
01:09:49,991 --> 01:09:54,991
auditions for so many fucking movies 
that we're talking about a town all 

1664
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:55,540
Italians.
What is this life on the line?

1665
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,980
It's another,
a power line guy.

1666
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:06,400
By the way.
We should this.

1667
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:09,720
This is probably worse for sure.
Fuck.

1668
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,020
How about urban cowboy?
That's the premise of urban cowboy.

1669
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,060
Urban Cowboy.
He worked on the line,

1670
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,150
will have a double feature.
I thought our night.

1671
01:10:20,151 --> 01:10:23,870
Well we'll play God and we'll play life 
on the line and we'll sync.

1672
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,610
We'll have people sync it up.
This is what.

1673
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:30,611
We'll do this,
mark those to mark those two movies and 

1674
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:31,340
so we'll get those on the Netflix and 
we'll,

1675
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,150
we'll,
after sober October is over,

1676
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:37,470
we'll get fucking hammered.
Will bring a five gallon jug,

1677
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:42,471
a Tito's in here to movies and I love 
it.

1678
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:48,400
I love it.
I rented a Bruce Willis one to laugh at 

1679
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:49,250
like I was like,
this is going to be a piece of shit.

1680
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:54,550
And it didn't get,
it didn't get bad until like 25 minutes 

1681
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,590
were left.
I was actually,

1682
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:55,880
this is pretty good.
It was this,

1683
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,980
uh,
I think it's called deathwish,

1684
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,910
which is a death wish.
Bruce Willis?

1685
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1686
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:06,280
Yeah.
And it was actually really well done 

1687
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:07,250
until like third act really.
Then it fell apart,

1688
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:10,780
but I'm watching it like this is going 
to be a piece of shit and 30 minutes.

1689
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:11,990
Am I sick?
Good fucking movie.

1690
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,040
It was like with the snowman.
Did you

1691
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,750
see the snowman?
Mm.

1692
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:16,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1693
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:18,960
That was a snowman.
Death wish.

1694
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:20,980
Bruce Willis is better than I thought.
Yeah,

1695
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,060
I thought it was going to.
He got delayed for some reason why they 

1696
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:26,190
get delayed because of mass shootings or
something.

1697
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,630
Oh boy.
I think so,

1698
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:32,160
yeah.
Something along those lines.

1699
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,320
Six point four.
And I am deb.

1700
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,050
I mean the trailer got real dog shit.
Yeah.

1701
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,830
You talking to me,
a guy I enjoyed Hudson Hawke.

1702
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:46,400
I was a big part was man,
eight percent rotten tomatoes.

1703
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,180
The snowman is.
Spoiler alert.

1704
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,400
The snowman ends.
It's this guy.

1705
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:54,490
Don't spoil it.
It's.

1706
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,600
It's so ridiculous.
It's so fucking ridiculous.

1707
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:02,810
What's it about?
It's about a serial killer who a snowman

1708
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:08,030
is leaving.
Snowman says hints and he's cutting off 

1709
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:08,430
body parts and then arranging them in 
the snow.

1710
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,530
So fast vendor is a alcoholic cop who is
trying to solve it.

1711
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,620
Who's Michael fassbender music from 
promethium it.

1712
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:21,060
See the robot from takes place abroad,
right?

1713
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,740
Isn't it takes place,
but may have.

1714
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,210
I don't want to talk negatively,
but val kilmer,

1715
01:12:25,211 --> 01:12:27,030
his performance is so disturbing that 
you.

1716
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,940
It pulls you out.
The movie immediately is terrible on it.

1717
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:34,970
Knows when he's going through the throat
stuff and they dubbed his voice in this.

1718
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:41,900
They had him dub his voice so they took 
out his voice because he couldn't 

1719
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:41,900
understand them I guess.
And then they had.

1720
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:45,870
They dumped his voice move.
I mean,

1721
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:50,871
it's like,
it's so bad that it throwed pills you 

1722
01:12:50,871 --> 01:12:52,581
out and you're like,
you definitely should have just not had 

1723
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:52,581
him in the movie and let him get 
healthy.

1724
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:54,120
I think he's doing better now.
Hopefully.

1725
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:54,990
No,
I think he is.

1726
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:56,640
I think he's gone into remission,
you know.

1727
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:57,480
I'll tell you what,
man,

1728
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,240
he fucking stole the show.

1729
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,840
And Wyatt earp.
Remember that kilmer?

1730
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,460
Amiya huckleberry.
Remember that Shit.

1731
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:06,650
You name all the moon.
He,

1732
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,330
uh,
the doors he was murdered.

1733
01:13:09,331 --> 01:13:14,331
He was a monster.
Marus val kilmer is a motherfucker 

1734
01:13:14,331 --> 01:13:16,290
genius.
CV can get that scene from hint with val

1735
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:19,410
kilmer as a white,
a dark holiday.

1736
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,620
Dark holiday in wider.
The funniest piece of shit he made.

1737
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:29,090
Did you see the.
I like the saint and I like the 

1738
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:29,550
superhero movie right now.
That was like a spy.

1739
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,990
Like I play again.
I get in disguise.

1740
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:36,030
Cranked.
This is the very end.

1741
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:37,590
Hold on.
Okay.

1742
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:42,591
The audio we pull up.
This is a great fucking scene and this 

1743
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:46,101
is a great scene.
Just the thing about the scene as you 

1744
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:47,950
believe it,
you just believe him.

1745
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,260
Well,
not dude,

1746
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:57,270
realize it's the wrong guy.
I didn't understand the scene until 

1747
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:02,130
recently.
People can't hear this on youtube.

1748
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:11,530
No.
Okay,

1749
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,080
so can talk.

1750
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,230
Yeah.
I didn't understand that.

1751
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,180
He's.
This is him.

1752
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:18,700
The reason that I didn't understand why 
the guy was scared.

1753
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:20,950
It's because doc holiday wants to die in
a gunfight.

1754
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,030
Yeah,
because he's dying.

1755
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,290
Yeah.
He wants to be shot.

1756
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:28,380
But also he was killing everybody.
Doc Holliday was a fucking monster and 

1757
01:14:30,001 --> 01:14:35,001
this guy was a want to be bad ass and he
realized that Doc Holliday was going to 

1758
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:38,120
fuck them up.
I've never seen this.

1759
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:41,420
You never saw this serious.
I don't like Westerns.

1760
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:43,880
I hate horses.
You hate horses?

1761
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,110
I do hate horses.
I.

1762
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:47,720
I've just never liked.
This is about fucking horses.

1763
01:14:47,721 --> 01:14:49,160
Tom.
I don't like this time.

1764
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:50,750
I don't like this.
I don't like the aesthetic.

1765
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,940
I don't like their hats.
I've seriously.

1766
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:55,280
I really.
I'm serious.

1767
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:57,750
I don't like any of it.
Are you shitting me?

1768
01:14:57,950 --> 01:15:02,060
One of the best movies ever.
Not Interested because occasionally they

1769
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:03,860
get on a horse and I don't like their 
hats.

1770
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,560
Yeah.
Can you look lower?

1771
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:08,770
Yeah,
still bothers me.

1772
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,010
I like the mustaches.
Okay.

1773
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,160
Sweaty is.
Yeah,

1774
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:17,080
we got close.
They are to each other.

1775
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:20,710
Do you think people really just did that
close to each other and had gunfights oh

1776
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:21,460
yeah.

1777
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,330
Dun,
Dun,

1778
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:30,331
Dun.
I wouldn't mind doing a gunfight with 

1779
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:31,400
you Tom.
Oh Shit.

1780
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,210
Come on.
He wants him to shoot him now.

1781
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,650
Wow.
It doesn't seem as good.

1782
01:15:55,651 --> 01:16:00,651
Second time around.
Maybe in the context of the entire 

1783
01:16:00,651 --> 01:16:02,040
movie.
I love these mustaches.

1784
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,810
They all look like alt comics now.
Kurt Russell was weird.

1785
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,650
I must make a batch to ice cream.
Wait a minute.

1786
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:16,420
Comics are all comics really anymore.
I felt like that does evaporated as 

1787
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:18,270
real.
I think it's still real.

1788
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:23,860
It's one of my favorite things.
Watching all comics go up in the main 

1789
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:23,860
room.
Yeah.

1790
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,730
You see it,
you know the,

1791
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,060
um,
they kind of get walk in shell shocked.

1792
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,930
They already know that it's not that 
their crowd.

1793
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,580
You could see.
I didn't realize what that was until you

1794
01:16:34,581 --> 01:16:37,470
just said it.
I've seen it before and I've always been

1795
01:16:37,471 --> 01:16:38,410
like,
oh,

1796
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:43,430
this is your first time here.
You can see in their eyes and you're 

1797
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,430
like,
oh,

1798
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,430
you're gonna.
Love it.

1799
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:44,500
This is the greatest team in the world.
Yeah,

1800
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:47,880
man.
It's so funny to get more aggressive.

1801
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:51,490
You can tell.
It's like a natural get aggressive about

1802
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:55,410
being progressive.
Motherfuckers aggressively progressive.

1803
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:01,410
Yeah.
I remember when all was like thought of 

1804
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:01,410
as you were.
If you were all.

1805
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:05,160
You were like soft and progressive and 
sensitive and kind.

1806
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,400
Now alt is right,
like all right,

1807
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:10,020
you think of,
you think of outright

1808
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,470
like that's all you hear about now.
It's like,

1809
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:14,860
all right.
Which is like assholes.

1810
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:18,080
You think of racism,
xenophobia,

1811
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:21,770
like the word all got sort of hijack.
That's true.

1812
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,360
Yeah.
I didn't even think about that,

1813
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:24,320
but it does.
You say,

1814
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:29,321
Oh,
most people's mind will definitely go 

1815
01:17:29,321 --> 01:17:31,430
outright over the last few years,
but like in the context in the world of 

1816
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:36,011
comedy,
it actually oddly usually implied 

1817
01:17:36,011 --> 01:17:37,610
somebody who's probably far to the left.
Yeah,

1818
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:42,611
but only with us.
I think only within income with 

1819
01:17:42,611 --> 01:17:44,890
audiences.
I don't think they even know that 

1820
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,231
expression anymore.
I feel like true all universally 

1821
01:17:47,231 --> 01:17:48,350
publicly has sort of been hijacked by.
All right,

1822
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:53,090
or at least the definition of it 
hijacked by outright people.

1823
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:54,410
That's true.
That is true,

1824
01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:58,390
right?
I don't.

1825
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,290
Yeah,
I guess so.

1826
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:03,050
I,
I assume there's got to be an ot left,

1827
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,920
right?
Well,

1828
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:04,220
I think

1829
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:09,440
was,
but I think the problem is once you say 

1830
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:09,440
all now everybody just thinks,
right.

1831
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,450
See,
I would have automatically turned out.

1832
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:14,010
Left.
Sounds made up.

1833
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:14,880
Yeah.
What?

1834
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:17,790
What is,
what are the alternative to the right of

1835
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,680
the ideas?
It's young,

1836
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:20,650
right?
So.

1837
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,470
Okay.
But assholes.

1838
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,290
So like the right.
If you think of conservative,

1839
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:30,291
you would think of like Lindsey Graham,
you think of people that are probably 

1840
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:30,291
racist,
but they keep it up.

1841
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:36,820
Slippery shoes and the Lindsey Graham 
was a chick until this week.

1842
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:38,940
I literally went,
that's it,

1843
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,600
dude.
I thought it was a $6,000,000

1844
01:18:40,601 --> 01:18:41,410
woman.
Oh,

1845
01:18:41,411 --> 01:18:45,310
he's got that southern accent that you 
can't tell if it's gay or not.

1846
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,810
It's the same thing.
It's like,

1847
01:18:46,811 --> 01:18:48,290
oh,
well I'll do the quail.

1848
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:52,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1849
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:57,950
There's,
this is weird watching these cavenaugh 

1850
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:57,950
hearings.
The whole thing is so strange.

1851
01:18:57,950 --> 01:18:58,600
Oh,
you gotta you gotTa.

1852
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,920
Keep your head down if you do not agree 
with the.

1853
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,120
Like I,
I just,

1854
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:04,540
I just tweeted that.
Uh,

1855
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,220
can you imagine defending your high 
school yearbook?

1856
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:11,230
That's all I tweeted.
I saw that and it was a fucking shit 

1857
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:11,230
show.
I saw that.

1858
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:11,230
Yeah.
And I was like,

1859
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,430
I'm fucking out.
You can't.

1860
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:15,860
People can't recognize that you're not 
in support of this guy.

1861
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:18,130
You're not in support of anything like,
but it's,

1862
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:22,970
it's a real thing and virtue signal 
simply show that people know,

1863
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:23,960
Oh,
I'm on your team.

1864
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,300
I'm just,
I'm just a fucking comedian.

1865
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:31,330
I'm just making an observation early.
Can you imagine defending your six year 

1866
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:31,330
high school yearbook?

1867
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:35,640
You remember Hicks is bit about Clarence
Thomas.

1868
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,620
No,
no.

1869
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:42,830
I'm sure I've heard it.
Hicks had a bit about Clarence Thomas 

1870
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:47,480
when they were.
They were trying to bring him into 

1871
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:47,550
Supreme Court.
Oh Man.

1872
01:19:47,551 --> 01:19:49,590
I wish I could remember exactly how the 
bit went,

1873
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:54,030
but it was a great bit,
but it was about his porn collection.

1874
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:55,440
You know,
like Mr Hare?

1875
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:56,410
Oh yes,
yes,

1876
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:01,420
yes.
Familiar at all with clam lap was 

1877
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,130
volumes one through all of them.
Says all of them.

1878
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:09,350
Yeah,
it was just like this funny bit like 

1879
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,350
examining.

1880
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,610
That was funny by the way.
Lindsay Graham,

1881
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:16,611
what do you see like after he left,
where they decided they voted on that 

1882
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:16,650
they're going to.
Well,

1883
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,360
they voted that's going to move to the 
floor,

1884
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:19,410
but they decided like,
you know,

1885
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:21,900
we'll try to do this extra week of,
uh,

1886
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,200
the FBI investigation and then he goes,
somebody's going to have to explain this

1887
01:20:25,201 --> 01:20:26,430
to trump.
I guess that'll be me.

1888
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:30,960
The press basically is a not so subtle 
way of being like,

1889
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:32,190
dum,
dum doesn't get it.

1890
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:35,130
So I'll trump said to one of the fucking
reporters today,

1891
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:38,730
now what a female reporter said.
He goes,

1892
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:41,580
he pointed to a woman and he said,
go ahead.

1893
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,320
And he goes,
she can't,

1894
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:44,880
she's speechless.
She can't believe I,

1895
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:47,670
I,
I called on her and she goes,

1896
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:48,360
well,
I didn't think.

1897
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:48,660
He goes,
yeah,

1898
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:49,620
you don't think,
yeah,

1899
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:51,930
I get that.
I'm sorry.

1900
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,220
And she goes,
I'm sorry sir,

1901
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,030
like,
listen to this.

1902
01:20:54,031 --> 01:20:55,380
Listen to this,
listen to this.

1903
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,450
You never do let's,
let's say this.

1904
01:20:57,630 --> 01:20:59,370
Listen this.
He can't help himself.

1905
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,420
He's crazy.
Yeah,

1906
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,110
she's shocked that I picked her state of
shock.

1907
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:05,850
I'm not thinking that.
That's okay.

1908
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:08,640
I know you're not thinking you never do.
No,

1909
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:12,750
go ahead.
Why that's president.

1910
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,120
That's such a crazy thing to say to 
someone.

1911
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,710
Yeah.
No,

1912
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,580
I know.
You're not thinking you never do.

1913
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,000
She must be someone that's written 
really negative things about you.

1914
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:21,030
He knows,
you know,

1915
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:25,200
he's got that hit list and everything.
Is this a piece of shit?

1916
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:25,560
Yeah.
Yeah,

1917
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:26,280
yeah.
Of course.

1918
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,980
It's all things madness.
He keeps a record here.

1919
01:21:28,981 --> 01:21:29,970
They have records of,
you know,

1920
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,190
anyone who's slided.
Um,

1921
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:34,790
anyone who's written anything bad said 
anything for sure man.

1922
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:35,400
See,
I'm not,

1923
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,590
I'm not a confrontational.
I don't like confrontation.

1924
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,540
So part,
there's part of me that goes,

1925
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,680
uh,
like I always thought I wish Kim Jong Un

1926
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,210
would be a fan so I could go over and 
party with him for a week.

1927
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:50,580
What?
You don't think that way?

1928
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:54,340
Yeah.
What luth dictators and party with him,

1929
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:56,250
Bro.
You want to party with him?

1930
01:21:56,550 --> 01:22:01,550
I would really like free Adele Castro 
would have been crazy to dense robin if 

1931
01:22:01,621 --> 01:22:03,600
you went over there,
partied with him.

1932
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,490
And then just like,
I don't know,

1933
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,880
like the next morning when you're like,
I had the best time,

1934
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:10,410
he was like,
send them to a labor camp.

1935
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:14,280
Fuck this guy.
Fuck you want to lose some weight?

1936
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,170
How about I give you one grain of rice a
day,

1937
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,700
man,
that would be fun.

1938
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,650
And you drank piss my pis.
That's it.

1939
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:27,651
You want stay hydrated is a jug of pis.
I guess I'm the only one that thinks 

1940
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:27,651
that way.
Yeah,

1941
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:28,270
yeah.
Yeah.

1942
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:33,380
No one wants to go party with them.
We talked with the fucking ruthless 

1943
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:33,380
dictator.
You get offered a private gig.

1944
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:34,260
They're like,
hey man,

1945
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,220
it's an.
It's a,

1946
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,150
it's in Pyongyang.

1947
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,840
Seemed to fly you private.
Are we getting paid before?

1948
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:45,180
I kind of need a little bit upfront.
I think maybe deposit,

1949
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:46,170
flight,
private.

1950
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:51,171
It's going to be really amazing.
[inaudible] a million dollar super 

1951
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:51,171
private.
You know what?

1952
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:54,510
Flying privates like sitting down.
So awesome.

1953
01:22:54,670 --> 01:22:56,210
Just sitting down.
Why?

1954
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,690
Why would they be amazing?
You're sitting.

1955
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:59,190
Yeah.
It's nothing.

1956
01:22:59,191 --> 01:23:04,191
It's not like you're flying private 
people rubbing your feet and sucking 

1957
01:23:04,191 --> 01:23:04,191
your Dick.
No ice cream.

1958
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:09,370
Ice Cream movies.
Playing the music is fucking full.

1959
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:14,371
Three d surround sound.
You could make those things happen if 

1960
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:14,371
you want.
Yeah,

1961
01:23:14,371 --> 01:23:16,300
if you want to fly private.
Dan Bilzerian probably does that.

1962
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:18,880
When he flies.
It's the draw for flying private.

1963
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:23,890
I obviously I can't afford it.
Omega three or four days just wouldn't 

1964
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:26,431
make any money on the road.
But is that you get done and you go 

1965
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:26,431
home,
you get done and you go to a.

1966
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:31,350
You get on a plane and you fly home or 
you just wait 20 minutes and you saved 

1967
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:32,050
$30,000.
Not Twenty minutes.

1968
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,600
Wouldn't be nice to get on a plane.
You fly private.

1969
01:23:34,601 --> 01:23:37,110
You fucking cock done it.
Are you calling that?

1970
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:41,230
God has no idea.
He's just making them a cup.

1971
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:46,530
You fly private though.
I don't fly private and you have flow 

1972
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:47,650
private for like a couple of times but 
it's never like.

1973
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:48,610
Because I was like,
ah,

1974
01:23:48,611 --> 01:23:50,750
I just got to get home.
It was.

1975
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:56,290
It was.
Instead of doing crazy transpo to get to

1976
01:23:56,291 --> 01:24:00,300
a Gig for a short of short flight though
I don't do it like on a red,

1977
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,470
call them out,
call them out for flying private.

1978
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:05,980
I saw that because I never thought about
it in the news like when.

1979
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:06,880
That'd be nice.
And I was like,

1980
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:07,850
yeah,
well you know,

1981
01:24:07,851 --> 01:24:12,851
it's one of the grossest celebrity 
things ever is the posing in front of 

1982
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:12,851
the private jet.

1983
01:24:12,851 --> 01:24:17,790
Dude doesn't know what all the Comedians
don't do that though because that's all 

1984
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:19,990
I guess they do.
Yeah.

1985
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:23,230
I'm black ones but I'm saying this,
not our friends.

1986
01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:24,380
Oh,
I know.

1987
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,670
I know.
A few that suck.

1988
01:24:25,671 --> 01:24:26,640
That do it.
Yeah.

1989
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:31,710
I've seen.
Are you looking at me looking at you 

1990
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:34,120
because you know who I'm talking about.
I mean there's only.

1991
01:24:34,121 --> 01:24:36,460
You can do it too.
It's just a weird thing.

1992
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,670
It's like it would definitely pose in 
front of it shirtless.

1993
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:40,320
You know?
He would.

1994
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:46,210
What?
Would it be weird if we were all on a 

1995
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:46,720
private jet flying somewhere and we post
this stuff.

1996
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:47,710
Would that be okay?
Yeah,

1997
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,410
because that's like dig in Aspen to 
celebrate.

1998
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:53,740
After sober October is over,
we decided to book a Gig together and we

1999
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:58,741
all were shirtless yammered on the 
runway looking rip because we're gonna 

2000
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:01,240
lose shitloads of weight this month and 
we all post.

2001
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:01,880
That's fine.
Right?

2002
01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:03,580
Let's do this.
I'm really excited now.

2003
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,600
How much,
what's the most amount of points you've 

2004
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:09,610
gotten in a month and a month?
Yeah,

2005
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:14,710
I think it was right just under 4,500.
Forty 500 is a lot.

2006
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:19,770
Yeah,
so the most I've seen somebody do with 

2007
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:20,320
seven.
Seven.

2008
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,600
Oh,
that's crazy.

2009
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:27,280
But that's like you're really,
really going after it all the time,

2010
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:30,440
you know,
probably probably 30 days.

2011
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,070
More than twice of what I did for 15 
days.

2012
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:34,450
Right.
[inaudible].

2013
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,600
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2014
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,110
That's a lot of work.
Oh,

2015
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,480
here's the thing we didn't discuss 
though.

2016
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,210
So what's the bet?
What are the stakes?

2017
01:25:43,211 --> 01:25:45,040
What are we doing right?
What happens if you win?

2018
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:46,570
What happens if you lose?
First of all,

2019
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:49,270
it's just us because ours isn't even in 
this bed.

2020
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:50,140
He asked,
he goes,

2021
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:50,860
well,
it goes.

2022
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:55,890
My long walks.
We couldn't stop giggling because I'm 

2023
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:57,620
like pictured already shirtless in New 
York with a chest strap on it.

2024
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,970
Fuck yeah,
he's.

2025
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:04,070
He's,
I think he's going to be San hope

2026
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,190
called me and said he wanted to do it.
I can do this though.

2027
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:12,320
Yeah.
He's not going to do this and he's also 

2028
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,661
not going to.
He's like sober octoberish I can't go 

2029
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:13,661
off everything or I'll have a stroke.
Will nest that.

2030
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:18,541
He can't go off everything.
He just can't go off of the meeting is 

2031
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,850
actually going to a doctor this week and
he's going to get himself checked out.

2032
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:25,180
Which is a rare thing is stan hope.
I don't know if you know those stand up 

2033
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,680
is sort of a policy to not go to the 
doctor and when it breaks he dies.

2034
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:30,920
Yeah.
That's his idea.

2035
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:34,200
His idea didn't want Mris,
doesn't want diagnosis,

2036
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:37,770
doesn't want recommendations,
doesn't want prescriptions.

2037
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:42,970
He is going this week.
He's going to go this week to get 

2038
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:43,190
himself checked out to make sure that he
can go.

2039
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:45,170
So I think,
I mean,

2040
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:51,320
as much as Stan hope is sort of a 
fatalist and he loves being this lovable

2041
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:56,510
drunk and I can't feel good to just 
always be drunk,

2042
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:57,680
it just can't feel good.

2043
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,620
I don't know.
He's taken time off before I.

2044
01:26:59,621 --> 01:27:02,210
I know he's taken time off before 
smoking as well.

2045
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:04,580
I know he quit smoking for quite a while
at one point in time.

2046
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,640
I think he would like to be healthier,
you know?

2047
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:09,260
I mean I know he would.
He would have more energy.

2048
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,770
I think it would make his comedy better.
I really do not.

2049
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,700
This comedy is not amazing.
It is.

2050
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,600
But I just think you'd have more energy 
know energy is a big thing.

2051
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:21,770
So I think and I also think he's 
something to do and connects them to us.

2052
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:26,150
He's out there and fucking bumfuck 
Bisbee Arizona out with a bunch of dorks

2053
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:27,610
there.

2054
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:34,690
I like,
I like partying as fuck you like 

2055
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:34,690
partying anywhere.
Yeah.

2056
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:37,760
You do party in North Korea.
You fuck the out.

2057
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:40,760
The invites out there.
I hope to God.

2058
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:43,700
Somebody just puts us in front of him.
Encrypted email.

2059
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:45,470
They go,
Kim,

2060
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:50,890
this,
and then I want you to watch a machine 

2061
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:50,890
story,
and then he watches and he goes,

2062
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:50,890
ah,
let's make another one.

2063
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:51,260
Let's make.
I've had,

2064
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:53,210
I've had moments where that where people
go,

2065
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,970
we could get you into some trouble and I
got fucking scared.

2066
01:27:56,150 --> 01:27:58,220
I was with a group in Tanzania.
They were like,

2067
01:27:58,221 --> 01:28:00,200
we're going to go kidnap a baby elephant
if you're into it.

2068
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,640
I was mad.
Damn Dude.

2069
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:03,870
Kidnap a baby elephant.
Yeah.

2070
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:09,160
Another tribe.
Kidnap this elephant sanctuary and they 

2071
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,390
get the kid back and the Messiah was 
going into kidnap back and I was like,

2072
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:17,290
part of me is like,
if you get a little bit of a buzz I'm 

2073
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:17,290
in,
but that was just.

2074
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,660
Sounds like a good way to die.
Yeah.

2075
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,600
Yeah.
Good.

2076
01:28:20,601 --> 01:28:23,320
Instagram video.
It's all about the insta stories.

2077
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,480
The um,
I have the time to do those instastories

2078
01:28:26,481 --> 01:28:28,670
because it does not interfere with 
actual life.

2079
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,880
Like how,
how often are you present in real life 

2080
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,311
when you're doing.
I look at your dots on your instastory 

2081
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:36,680
and like Jesus,
there's like 70 dot.

2082
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,450
No,
I don't ever put that many.

2083
01:28:38,451 --> 01:28:40,760
I put up,
I'll probably put up 10 a day.

2084
01:28:41,270 --> 01:28:42,950
That's the same thing.
Yeah.

2085
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:46,260
What's up?
It's not mine or yours might be mine.

2086
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:48,110
Why is it beeping?
Do I take it off of this?

2087
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:51,920
Having it hanging like that,
but sometimes it'll just do it anyways,

2088
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:54,470
but yeah,
it's fine like that for working out.

2089
01:28:55,060 --> 01:29:00,060
If it beeps.
One beat means it's on that three beat 

2090
01:29:00,060 --> 01:29:01,410
means I shut all the beeps off on the 
APP so I could use it in yoga class.

2091
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,130
Yeah.
Oh,

2092
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,820
okay.
Yeah.

2093
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,230
I don't want it to beep.
And of course,

2094
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,290
you know.
Yeah.

2095
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:10,560
You know,
you can wear those sensors right if you 

2096
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:10,560
want it to like make,
get a good reading to start.

2097
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:11,970
It worked out great.
It was good.

2098
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,720
I look at instastories,
I look at instagram as part of business.

2099
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,350
Start me again.
Fucking thing's annoying.

2100
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:21,240
Uh,
you looked at as part of business.

2101
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,880
Part of my business and so I go,
I am very present in life.

2102
01:29:24,881 --> 01:29:26,170
I don't,
it's the story,

2103
01:29:26,171 --> 01:29:31,171
everything,
but like in moments like when the rat 

2104
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:33,961
runs into our house,
I definitely learned the story that I 

2105
01:29:33,961 --> 01:29:33,961
always have my phone on me.
It's in my pocket.

2106
01:29:33,970 --> 01:29:35,590
I like how you're like,
I'm very present.

2107
01:29:35,591 --> 01:29:37,240
And then right before we started you're 
like,

2108
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:41,110
I'm terrible at this at home.
That was not a good parent.

2109
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:45,760
I'm taking care of my kids by myself,
my wife somewhere traveling abroad.

2110
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:47,380
It all these dots,
Bro.

2111
01:29:47,381 --> 01:29:50,050
That ain't 10 dots like this one.
What the fuck are you on?

2112
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,010
Three,
four,

2113
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:52,330
five,
six,

2114
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:53,510
seven,
eight,

2115
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,590
eight dots.
Yeah,

2116
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,960
it looks like more.
I said I love the school with a bag of 

2117
01:29:59,960 --> 01:29:59,980
rice,
but it's only 1:00

2118
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:04,980
PM and you have eight dots already 
summer from last night and yesterday 

2119
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:04,980
it's 24 hours.
Okay.

2120
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:06,720
But yeah,
I,

2121
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,550
I'm,
I'm parenting by myself.

2122
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:10,780
I can't do,
I'm not good at it.

2123
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:11,740
I,
it's,

2124
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:13,840
it's a good chance to bond with your 
kids.

2125
01:30:13,990 --> 01:30:16,990
It is.
Or they realize exactly how out of touch

2126
01:30:16,991 --> 01:30:18,360
you are with their lives.
Well,

2127
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:22,620
um,
I'm not one for giving parental advice,

2128
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:27,621
but what I would say to do is abandoned 
all other things you do while you're 

2129
01:30:27,621 --> 01:30:29,400
doing it.
So think of yourself as like a mom,

2130
01:30:29,570 --> 01:30:34,570
like a house mom,
like instead of like trying to squeeze 

2131
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,550
it in with all the other shit you do,
you won't be good at it if you do that.

2132
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,620
If,
when I,

2133
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:37,040
if,
if,

2134
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:42,041
if,
if my wife goes somewhere and I have to 

2135
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:42,041
just take care of my kids.
I don't do anything else.

2136
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:44,310
I schedule nothing,
nothing else.

2137
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,680
If I do a podcast,
I have to do it during the day while the

2138
01:30:46,681 --> 01:30:49,770
kids are at school and then once there I
don't go to,

2139
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:52,650
I don't do shows that night.
I don't do shit.

2140
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,140
I just hang out with them and we do 
shit.

2141
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:57,960
Make sure I do take them to a pottery 
class.

2142
01:30:57,961 --> 01:31:00,840
So we'll go to a fucking Dojo.
Boom.

2143
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:03,660
One of those bouncy places.
They have trampolines and shit.

2144
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:09,270
Dude.
Just do stuff with them and leave your 

2145
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,020
phone off,
leave your phone off.

2146
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:15,110
Your kids are there.
Unless unless you want your wife to 

2147
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,110
contact you,
maybe that,

2148
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:17,010
but don't look at your twitter,
just hang out with them.

2149
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:19,560
It's um,
it's,

2150
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,500
you have to like have like rules in your
head.

2151
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,770
My kids are a lot older kids though.
Yeah.

2152
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:27,330
But still you want to interact with them
and no matter how old they are,

2153
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:28,880
I know.
But your kids are still young.

2154
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:29,540
Minor,
minor,

2155
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:34,541
like 14 and 12 and so yeah.
But don't you hang out with them and do 

2156
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:35,620
stuff?
Last night we watched deadpool.

2157
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:37,160
Cool.
We're going out to dinner tonight.

2158
01:31:37,161 --> 01:31:38,230
Perfect.
Yeah,

2159
01:31:38,231 --> 01:31:42,530
but just the actual getting up,
I was telling Tom I got up at 5:45

2160
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:44,350
to get,
make them breakfast and,

2161
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:50,020
and my daughter,
my oldest daughter had already pulled 

2162
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:50,020
the trash out,
put it by the door,

2163
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,680
back door for me to take out.
Was literally gave me a speech and I was

2164
01:31:51,681 --> 01:31:52,520
like,
just so you know,

2165
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:56,210
you need to be ready to go at 5:45.
Like you can't just get up at 5:45

2166
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:58,180
and kind of like slow roll into the 
morning.

2167
01:31:58,181 --> 01:32:00,730
I'm at school a C,
they've got to be.

2168
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,040
She got to be at school at eight I 
think,

2169
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,710
but it's usually lecturing you,
Dr.

2170
01:32:05,810 --> 01:32:07,690
I said,
but and leanne was loving it.

2171
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,470
Leanne calls.
He's like,

2172
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:09,490
yeah,
you got to get going.

2173
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,220
You can't just get up and be regular 
burger,

2174
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,080
your daddy on duty.
Got I.

2175
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:16,600
I made the mistake of saying I was going
to make pancakes and everyone was like,

2176
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:18,550
you can't,
you don't have time to make pancakes.

2177
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:19,520
And I was like,
guys,

2178
01:32:19,521 --> 01:32:21,220
if I'm going to make pancakes,
I'm making pancakes.

2179
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,860
I've got the standard batter storage and
they're like,

2180
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:25,390
we need something else.
We're already hungry.

2181
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,740
We've got to go.
And so yeah,

2182
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,870
we're on a schedule with Lianza gangster
with that shit.

2183
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,840
I just,
when you phoned me into her life,

2184
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:32,190
my brain doesn't work like that.

2185
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,400
Right?
Yeah.

2186
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:38,520
I get that.
But it's like when you're just hanging 

2187
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:38,520
out with them,
just them.

2188
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,420
It's a,
you've got to realize is.

2189
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:44,830
I mean it's for everyone that has kids,
just you only have a few of these years.

2190
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,510
You know,
you only,

2191
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,550
you only have a few and then next thing 
you know,

2192
01:32:48,551 --> 01:32:51,010
they're adults.
It happens quick.

2193
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,230
Yeah.
So 14.

2194
01:32:53,231 --> 01:32:54,690
What happened overnight?
You know,

2195
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,730
I have friends that don't have good 
relationships with their kids and weird.

2196
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,230
It's weird to see that sucks.
Sucks.

2197
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:03,220
Sucks.
Sucks.

2198
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:06,130
It's weird to see kids that are 
resentful,

2199
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,280
angry at you.
You got that comment?

2200
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:10,240
For sure.
For sure.

2201
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:11,860
Right?
Is that coming?

2202
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:13,810
No.
Teenagers is tough,

2203
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:14,940
man.
It is tough there.

2204
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,760
Well,
first of all,

2205
01:33:15,761 --> 01:33:20,470
being a teenager's fucking tough.
You gotta like remind them over and over

2206
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:25,471
again.
You're dealing with a term called 

2207
01:33:25,471 --> 01:33:27,850
downpour of hormones that you just don't
know what to do with.

2208
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,280
You remember what that was like?
Yeah.

2209
01:33:29,290 --> 01:33:31,610
Yeah.
You're so confused all the time.

2210
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:35,320
Confused bodies in fucking disarray for 
you.

2211
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:40,321
It's probably exacerbated by like them 
being like this generation then knowing 

2212
01:33:40,321 --> 01:33:44,221
that you're racist.
Fucking trunk and racist.

2213
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:48,130
And then the crossfit people are 
picketing outside your house.

2214
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:57,760
What are our steaks?
So that haven't worked.

2215
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,200
Okay.
So the most you've ever,

2216
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:02,740
the most you've ever gotten is um,
so what did I,

2217
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:04,810
what did I get today?
200 or something like that.

2218
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,910
What did I get to 11 to 11.
That's a normal workout for me,

2219
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:13,920
right?
I think 200 is like a is a good strong 

2220
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:13,920
workout.
Yeah.

2221
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:14,020
So good.
Normal workout.

2222
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:19,260
So if you get 200,
well if I did 200 twice a day,

2223
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:25,050
Jesus men,
how many days a week you plan on doing 

2224
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:25,360
that?
I'm going hard son.

2225
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:26,380
I'm trying to kill Bert.

2226
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,630
I'm in.
I'm in for the challenge.

2227
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:33,680
Yeah,
I mean I want you to say that Mickey 

2228
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:33,680
Mantle genes.
Real well.

2229
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,110
Shit.
You did the UVA.

2230
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:38,110
You just heard what he's doing.
I know and I understand that.

2231
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:41,380
I have that.
I have the accessibility to get there.

2232
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,420
I'm,
I'm up for the challenge.

2233
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:45,860
But you're planning on Joe,
you're planning on trust.

2234
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:51,340
Yeah,
but you're actually planning a 400 

2235
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:51,340
points a day.
You're running six days a week,

2236
01:34:51,341 --> 01:34:52,210
let's say,
or what?

2237
01:34:52,510 --> 01:34:53,350
Yeah,
at least.

2238
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,370
Yeah.
I might go seven,

2239
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,890
seven days a week.
So how about I lose 400 points a day?

2240
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:57,980
Can

2241
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:59,750
I do different things?
That's true.

2242
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:01,280
That's the key to it.
We put an 8,000

2243
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:02,720
points.
You're close to it.

2244
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,870
I want to try to pretty close to eight.
That's the only thing is I have a 

2245
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:07,880
hunting trip that's going to take me 
away for six days.

2246
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:11,780
I have a cruise that's t to take me away
for five,

2247
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:17,490
but when I think of Bobby Kelly's going 
to.

2248
01:35:18,031 --> 01:35:19,630
When I'm doing the hunting trip,
like I'll put.

2249
01:35:19,660 --> 01:35:22,100
I'll send this to you jamie.
You see what I'm like.

2250
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,070
A typical day in the mountains is like 
when you're.

2251
01:35:26,150 --> 01:35:31,150
That's some of the most brutal workouts 
I've ever done because you're hiking at 

2252
01:35:31,150 --> 01:35:33,590
altitude and when you're at altitude 
man,

2253
01:35:33,591 --> 01:35:37,280
it's fucking.
I did 12 miles a day.

2254
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:39,740
Thirty 1000 steps.
Shit.

2255
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:44,090
One hundred and 16 floors at 8,100
feet.

2256
01:35:44,180 --> 01:35:45,110
Well,
just so you know,

2257
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:47,660
if like if you wore it,
that's a.

2258
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:51,110
that's a typical day in the mountains 
hunting.

2259
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:53,510
If you wore it by the way for that,
you would just,

2260
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,730
you know,
it would come out to some crazy number.

2261
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:58,370
How many steps did you say?
I mean that's 31,000

2262
01:35:58,371 --> 01:35:59,210
steps.
Twelve,

2263
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:04,750
12 miles in the mountains,
but it's the thing is the elevation 

2264
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:08,300
you're going up and down hills and 
stepping over logs and you're always,

2265
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:11,900
always breathing heavy.
It's rough.

2266
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,020
Are you going to wear it for that?
Fuck Ya.

2267
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,740
Okay.
Jesus Christ.

2268
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:18,860
Fuck,
I guess I'm running another marathon.

2269
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:25,330
I mean that's working out.
You want me to run around that Goddamn 

2270
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:27,530
cruise ship?
So 120,000

2271
01:36:27,770 --> 01:36:29,870
points a year.
A month would be.

2272
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:32,850
You know,
you can't get them any points left.

2273
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:37,870
There's no way.
What are you talking to them when were 

2274
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:37,870
talking to 8,000
at the most.

2275
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:38,690
Like he said,
he said 4,500

2276
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:41,180
was his best.
His best month and that's crazy.

2277
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:46,180
That was working out like probably 22 or
23 days and doing,

2278
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:52,360
you know,
something like 200 plus points each 

2279
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:52,360
time.
That's amazing.

2280
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:52,730
Okay,
so 8,000

2281
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,110
is redeemable.
Yeah.

2282
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:55,520
That's crazy.
Okay.

2283
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,510
Your best.
Most 4,000

2284
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,910
now the without like being in a 
competition.

2285
01:37:01,911 --> 01:37:03,980
I've hit 43,
4,400

2286
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:04,690
let's say.
Okay.

2287
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:08,860
Okay.
Joe Immediately would get 6,000

2288
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:11,040
if you just did what you did today.
Everyday.

2289
01:37:11,041 --> 01:37:14,630
At this month you can just do it if I 
did it every day every year,

2290
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,990
but that was just the morning workout 
today.

2291
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,880
But we're all doing to a dose.
I got this recognized school here.

2292
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:24,881
We got to have someone call the fucking 
rock so we know we're going to stay on 

2293
01:37:28,101 --> 01:37:30,620
this and this makes me more excited than
anything.

2294
01:37:30,621 --> 01:37:30,920
Yeah,
no,

2295
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:33,350
it's good.
It's good to challenge whatever it is.

2296
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:35,450
Listen,
we should all come in even and just make

2297
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:38,000
red pay for everything was never going 
to.

2298
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,700
He's never gonna catch up to big shout 
out our.

2299
01:37:40,701 --> 01:37:41,930
I mean our,
we've said it before,

2300
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:44,690
but he really did come through on that 
bet.

2301
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:46,220
He did.
I'm saying um,

2302
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:51,221
when he took us to the game,
he bought crazy tickets and I thought 

2303
01:37:51,221 --> 01:37:55,871
they were much less.
He gave us a first class experience.

2304
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,190
Nice.
And um,

2305
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:59,340
we should make them do it again.
Yeah.

2306
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:02,640
Like what would be the stakes go?
It's gotta be.

2307
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,790
It's gotta be something that we can all 
participate in.

2308
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,460
Floyd Mayweather.
Manny Pacquiao to Ooh,

2309
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,660
that's a great one.
Front row we're talking about.

2310
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,600
Yeah.
By the way,

2311
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:18,610
by the way,
say whatever you want about me being on 

2312
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:21,111
my phone the entire time.
I have the best fucking video from that 

2313
01:38:21,111 --> 01:38:24,500
of the last,
the last them scoring a touchdown 

2314
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:24,500
videotape,
the touchdown,

2315
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,760
and they cut to Tom and are a nice.
Yeah,

2316
01:38:26,761 --> 01:38:27,540
no,
it's great.

2317
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:30,580
That was a really fun fucking weekend.
That was dude.

2318
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,770
Pick.
That place is going.

2319
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,630
That's where Larry,
the cable guy performs.

2320
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,410
Oh my God.
Fucking places like that.

2321
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,380
It's so big.
As audiences are winds,

2322
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:41,360
floyd mayweather,
Pacquiao.

2323
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,290
I don't know.
I think it's in December.

2324
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:47,170
Is it in December?
Yeah,

2325
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:50,360
definitely.
It might be in Japan though,

2326
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:55,260
into.
This might be a day of a book to get.

2327
01:38:55,261 --> 01:39:00,261
So I don't know.
There's talk that it might be their 

2328
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:00,261
guys.
Oh,

2329
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:02,680
let's go to that in Japan.
That sounds crazy,

2330
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:06,210
but it also.
That's like asking a hundred grand.

2331
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:11,760
We're not flying.
Coach are not flying coach.

2332
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:15,760
She lost.
There's no way

2333
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,850
he could win.
Right?

2334
01:39:16,851 --> 01:39:21,610
So someone has to someone else to win.
But more importantly one person is going

2335
01:39:21,611 --> 01:39:22,590
to lose.
Oh.

2336
01:39:22,591 --> 01:39:27,591
So like if you beat me and I beat you,
that don't mean shit because we're all 

2337
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:27,591
beating Ari.

2338
01:39:27,591 --> 01:39:28,800
Right?
It's like a skins game.

2339
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:30,480
He's already,
but you know,

2340
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:31,090
he's going to be like,
I'm not

2341
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:32,400
doing the fucking point.
Maybe,

2342
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:33,750
but maybe he's listening to us right 
now.

2343
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:35,070
He's stewing.
Should we call him?

2344
01:39:35,380 --> 01:39:38,010
He's getting angry and he's sober,
which Mike might do even more.

2345
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:39,060
I was like,
fuck you.

2346
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,940
I'm going to win.
We're going to fucking win.

2347
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:45,950
What if red goes crazy?
Fucking goes whole hog every day.

2348
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:51,870
Six hours a day.
Takes spin classes and crossfit classes 

2349
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,280
and whereas it,
during Jujitsu,

2350
01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:57,270
floyd mayweather,
his planet come back in Tokyo before his

2351
01:39:57,271 --> 01:39:58,000
rematch with Mandy.

2352
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,490
This was a couple weeks ago.
So.

2353
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,530
Oh,
so he wants a tune up fight.

2354
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,140
Huh?
I might not be real.

2355
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:06,850
Yeah.
Might that be?

2356
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:08,150
Yeah.
I'm,

2357
01:40:08,170 --> 01:40:09,150
I'm,
you know,

2358
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:10,920
would you go to that?
You have to go to the fight though.

2359
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,540
Yes.
It'd be an interesting fight.

2360
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:14,250
I mean,
they're both past their prime,

2361
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:16,290
but it will be a fun event too.
Yeah.

2362
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:19,230
But I mean was just knocked out.
Lucas,

2363
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:24,120
PTSA and floyd hasn't fought in a year 
since he beat conor Mcgregor,

2364
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:27,330
but that's not a real box.
I mean it's a boxing match,

2365
01:40:27,331 --> 01:40:29,190
but it's on a boxing match at an elite 
level.

2366
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:34,191
Like if it was,
if he was boxing terrence Crawford or 

2367
01:40:34,191 --> 01:40:36,360
someone who's like at the very top now,
he's not in that kind of zone right now,

2368
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:41,750
but he's still the best ever.
It if not the one of assurance of the 

2369
01:40:42,181 --> 01:40:44,460
greatest boxers in the history of the 
world ever.

2370
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,180
You know,
no question.

2371
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:48,310
What we should do is tear the tear of 
the winnings.

2372
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,920
Okay.
First place pays for nothing.

2373
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,570
Whole weekend.
I liked this idea.

2374
01:40:52,571 --> 01:40:57,571
Second pays for their pace,
for their tickets to whatever is least 

2375
01:40:57,571 --> 01:40:59,470
expensive,
pays for their ticket and nothing else.

2376
01:40:59,740 --> 01:41:04,740
Third place plays for a.
all hotels are saying tear it off,

2377
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:08,380
so that's the last place.
Just pays the most out,

2378
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:10,810
but he's not.
He's not dropping so forth.

2379
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:14,440
Twenty grams in the last place.
Person has to cover flights,

2380
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:15,880
but they can use their miles.
See,

2381
01:41:15,881 --> 01:41:18,390
the problem is res bets are like,
no,

2382
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:18,730
no,
no.

2383
01:41:19,030 --> 01:41:23,520
The loser has to wear a beard of my 
pubes and he's got a.

2384
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:28,920
he's got to clean his face with his 
fucking all of his suggestions.

2385
01:41:30,631 --> 01:41:35,631
So psychotic,
drink all of our pis and I really am 

2386
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:36,430
solid over my shoulder.
She goes,

2387
01:41:36,431 --> 01:41:37,340
no,
no,

2388
01:41:37,341 --> 01:41:37,990
you were not drinking.

2389
01:41:37,990 --> 01:41:39,760
Everyone's pissed.
He said,

2390
01:41:40,180 --> 01:41:42,610
he's like,
you got to do a panhandler for six hours

2391
01:41:42,611 --> 01:41:45,040
on the radio.
She was a homeless guy who was like,

2392
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:48,760
I'm into that already.
But yeah,

2393
01:41:48,761 --> 01:41:49,510
he's,
yeah.

2394
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:51,430
He wanted us to do really ridiculous 
shit,

2395
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:54,490
like down the street naked.
The tears of paying for it.

2396
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:56,320
So it's not all.
It's a good idea.

2397
01:41:56,430 --> 01:42:01,430
Right?
So one person doesn't take the whole 

2398
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:01,430
beating.
First place pays nothing all week.

2399
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:02,560
That's true.
The first place should be.

2400
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,260
I don't cover the first place.
You'd get like a belt.

2401
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,620
We should make a belt.
Sure.

2402
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,000
October belt.
A real one.

2403
01:42:10,001 --> 01:42:11,020
Like a real,
real wild.

2404
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:12,350
Like a wwe.
Yeah.

2405
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:13,820
Yeah.
Oh,

2406
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,350
October,
October,

2407
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,360
October.
Belt Champ,

2408
01:42:18,610 --> 01:42:19,970
champ.
Jamie,

2409
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:24,990
I need.
This is a project I need you to look up 

2410
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:24,990
where you would get a pro wrestling 
belt.

2411
01:42:25,700 --> 01:42:27,130
Not Know knockoff shit.
No,

2412
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:27,940
no.
Nice one.

2413
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:28,450
Oh God.

2414
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:33,480
I just got.
I just found my inner voice when I work 

2415
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:33,480
out that fucking belt.
Just.

2416
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,380
Oh my God,
I'm so excited.

2417
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:40,440
Inner Voice.
So you're going to start doing your two 

2418
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:40,440
days,
but I might be doing three days.

2419
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:40,980
Wow.
Looking at him.

2420
01:42:40,981 --> 01:42:41,830
Looking at me.
Serious.

2421
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,570
He's excited now,
Dude.

2422
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:49,480
Oh,
now tell him he ain't shit and there's 

2423
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:49,480
no way he'll win this firearm up even 
more.

2424
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,780
Tell me I can't run a marathon.
You can definitely ran the marathon,

2425
01:42:53,190 --> 01:42:54,610
but there's no way you'll win this 
though.

2426
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:56,790
There's no way.
Oh Wow.

2427
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:59,290
Tommy's got reverse psychology.
We can get a pepsi belt.

2428
01:42:59,830 --> 01:43:03,400
Who the fuck wants a Pepsi Belt?
I know a guy.

2429
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,600
He's diabetic.
So what?

2430
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:10,820
Which we have on the uh,
is that me up on the right there?

2431
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:16,010
I think it's a bearded gentleman bell.
Okay.

2432
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:19,450
So we found a company that makes belts.
What's the name of his company?

2433
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:22,060
Belts.com.
Okay.

2434
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,470
So we need some sort of a logo.
We need sober.

2435
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:28,930
October is definitely the name of it,
right?

2436
01:43:28,931 --> 01:43:33,931
The sober October belt and undisputed 
sober Ciobo champ.

2437
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:37,780
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2438
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:39,370
What should we have on it?
Still?

2439
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:41,710
Okay.
I should be our faces engraved in it.

2440
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,020
Should it be like the,
like the no smoking sign?

2441
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:46,370
No boost sign.
No pills,

2442
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:49,980
no needles,
no need to get on the sides.

2443
01:43:50,380 --> 01:43:51,920
Yeah.
Good with needles,

2444
01:43:51,950 --> 01:43:52,400
piles

2445
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:57,400
of coke.
And then guy tried to suck his own dick 

2446
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:00,470
and we'll just tell everyone it's yoga.
Yeah.

2447
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:05,471
So we'll have to come up with how long 
does it take to make one of these belts 

2448
01:44:05,471 --> 01:44:07,130
month?
Let's find out.

2449
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,620
Hey listen,
whoever pro-am belts,

2450
01:44:09,621 --> 01:44:11,660
if you're listening.
Three to four weeks.

2451
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:16,700
Oh fucking fun.
So if we finished the design by the end 

2452
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,560
of this week,
we might be able to have it at the end 

2453
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,420
of the month.
You might be holding up that build up 

2454
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:25,420
the house.
I feel great.

2455
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:25,420
You definitely want to be holding up at 
all.

2456
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,890
I'll definitely either me or joe 
flights.

2457
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:29,570
Lodging tickets.
Mrs.

2458
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,100
Missing you.
There's no way.

2459
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,620
Forty $500 maybe you've never worked out
with them.

2460
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:34,970
I've worked out with them.
What happens?

2461
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,750
Oh,
he gives up.

2462
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,540
He used to work out together.
Done like hotel,

2463
01:44:38,541 --> 01:44:42,050
like pre before we did.
Actually we went,

2464
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:45,230
when we were in Phoenix,
we went to a like an MMA gym.

2465
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:46,010
Oh,
that's right.

2466
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,000
Yeah,
that's right.

2467
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,780
We did.
We worked out.

2468
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,230
Yeah.
I tell him.

2469
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:52,370
I used to go to Barry's bootcamp 
together.

2470
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,330
What happened?
I,

2471
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:59,300
I don't mind throwing up if I work out.
Like I like I ended up like,

2472
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,420
you enjoy it.
I do because I know that I've done it as

2473
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:05,540
hard as I can do it.
I get it.

2474
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:11,050
I've thrown up before a girl came into 
my green room this weekend and threw up 

2475
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:15,311
all.
I thought she was looking for the 

2476
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:15,311
bathroom and just fucking throw up.
I'm like,

2477
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:18,750
that's your kind of crowd.
I started throwing up,

2478
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:19,920
by the way,
your pr,

2479
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:22,580
your Promo you showed me.
It's going to bring in more vomiters.

2480
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:25,460
I cut a promo.
I'm doing.

2481
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:28,400
It'll be dropping next Monday.
We're announcing my tour next week,

2482
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,090
but uh,
I cut a promo hurling.

2483
01:45:32,270 --> 01:45:32,690
No,
no,

2484
01:45:32,691 --> 01:45:34,490
no.
It's just what it's like being at one of

2485
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:37,220
my shows and just fucking chaos.
It's chaos.

2486
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:38,690
Yeah.
Well your shows or chaos.

2487
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,030
You,
you're not doing just a comedy show.

2488
01:45:41,030 --> 01:45:43,430
You've got like a whole Party experience
happening.

2489
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,560
We got mean stand up and stand up 
straight,

2490
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:50,561
stand up.
And then a lot of times I do a meet and 

2491
01:45:50,561 --> 01:45:52,100
greet people get to talk and hang out.
I think as a fan I liked that.

2492
01:45:52,101 --> 01:45:57,101
So I do that.
And then a lot of times at the end of 

2493
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,150
the night and a lot of times I go,
I'll be at the bar next door and uh,

2494
01:45:58,250 --> 01:46:00,470
everyone goes to the bar.
Those are fucking crazy.

2495
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:03,820
Do you think you can do that when the 
crowds get to like 3000,

2496
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:05,300
$4,000?
Of course not.

2497
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,490
I don't know.
I actually had a real loose,

2498
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:12,500
had conversation about what meet and 
greets are going to look like on this 

2499
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,220
theater tour because I don't want to get
rid of the meet and greet.

2500
01:46:13,230 --> 01:46:18,230
So it means it as silly as it sounds,
but I think it means something for them 

2501
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:19,720
to hang out does.

2502
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:22,310
And I don't want to charge 100 bucks for
a meet and greet,

2503
01:46:22,311 --> 01:46:26,090
but I definitely can't do 1200 people 
like I did when I did the Wilbur.

2504
01:46:26,091 --> 01:46:30,020
I told everyone to go meet me at the bar
next door and it was fucking chaos.

2505
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,180
I mean it was like,
oh,

2506
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,390
like literally elbow to assholes and I 
just was not,

2507
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:37,970
I didn't get to hang out with anyone.
I was just taking pictures over and over

2508
01:46:37,971 --> 01:46:42,971
and over.
So I want to try to figure out some 

2509
01:46:42,971 --> 01:46:42,971
workaround for a meet and greet for this
theater tour.

2510
01:46:42,971 --> 01:46:44,360
Because Dude,
when I go to Scandinavia,

2511
01:46:44,361 --> 01:46:46,660
I want to meet to meet podcasts.
You know,

2512
01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:50,130
one thing that annoys me,
those pictures where

2513
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:54,090
people have stacks of pictures they want
you to sign and the sound that is not,

2514
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:57,740
does not like take a picture with me.
That's not,

2515
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,270
will you sign this from my friend that's
not sign this for me.

2516
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:03,750
That's like you're asking me to work.
And they fucking shame.

2517
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,240
And they go,
they come out with the one that,

2518
01:47:06,241 --> 01:47:06,660
hey,
we sent.

2519
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:07,290
You Go,
oh yeah.

2520
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,130
And then the sixth behind it come to the
site and they're like,

2521
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:13,620
and this and this and this and this.
Some guy,

2522
01:47:13,621 --> 01:47:14,990
the other day I had 30.
Yeah,

2523
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:15,820
whoa.
Yeah,

2524
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:16,340
they,
they've,

2525
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:21,370
they've run into you at the airport and 
there's like six dudes and they have 

2526
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:21,370
stacks like,
hey man,

2527
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:25,251
you're,
you're showing up and you want me to 

2528
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:25,251
work.
This is what you're doing.

2529
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:25,390
You want me to stop what I'm doing?
And you think it's only,

2530
01:47:25,391 --> 01:47:26,970
it's only five minutes of your time.

2531
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:27,690
Yeah,
that's true.

2532
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:32,691
But you're not really a fan.
You're just a guy trying to get me to 

2533
01:47:32,691 --> 01:47:32,691
work for sure.
This is,

2534
01:47:32,691 --> 01:47:33,390
you signed them.
I signed one.

2535
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:34,990
I'll say I'll sign one,
I'll sign one.

2536
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:39,991
And they get mad.
Like some guy got mad and philly 

2537
01:47:39,991 --> 01:47:41,330
remember that dude got upset.
He's famous.

2538
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:43,530
And I was like,
you're not a fan.

2539
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:45,420
You just told me you're not a fan.
He told me.

2540
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,830
He literally told me,
he's like a huge.

2541
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:49,320
You don't even sell.
Well he goes,

2542
01:47:49,321 --> 01:47:51,000
you're so full,
like $7.

2543
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:56,580
I go,
I don't give a fuck what they sell for 

2544
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:56,580
my autograph.
I go,

2545
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:57,690
I said,
don't,

2546
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,310
don't show up at the airport and 
harassed me.

2547
01:47:59,311 --> 01:48:00,630
Then I,
I'll sign one.

2548
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:02,510
Do you do a meet and greet?
You used to do meet and greet tonight.

2549
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:04,980
I used to do.
I'll still do that,

2550
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:08,220
but I used to do meet and greets at the 
Chicago theater for 3,700

2551
01:48:08,221 --> 01:48:13,221
people.
I would wait and take photos with 

2552
01:48:13,221 --> 01:48:14,520
everybody,
but you can't do it anymore.

2553
01:48:14,521 --> 01:48:17,790
People go too crazy as the podcast got 
crazier and crazier.

2554
01:48:17,791 --> 01:48:22,791
People go crazy and they were hold on 
your arm and want to tell you how you 

2555
01:48:22,791 --> 01:48:24,240
changed their life and want to tell you 
like long stories.

2556
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:24,960
I'm like,
look,

2557
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:30,890
there's 500 people behind you waiting.
I can't give you 15 minutes here.

2558
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:33,090
I can give you five minutes.
I just,

2559
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:38,380
it just got too strange and it just got 
too many people wanting to get on the 

2560
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:42,501
podcast like you got to get me on.
I'm going to tell you my story about 

2561
01:48:42,501 --> 01:48:42,870
beating drug addiction.
Like I'm sure it's a great story.

2562
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,370
I can't get you on a stop.

2563
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:46,230
This is not how this works.
You know?

2564
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:48,010
There's just too much of that,
too much.

2565
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,250
It's not.
If it was just high,

2566
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:52,650
I want to take a picture.
I had a good time.

2567
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,420
Great.
But it's not that.

2568
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:59,620
Then it's all these agenda driven people
that all want to do things and they 

2569
01:48:59,620 --> 01:49:01,410
want,
they want you to do things for them.

2570
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:03,810
They think there's too many people that 
have been on the podcast,

2571
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,840
just regular folks and then they get on 
the podcast and now people know about 

2572
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:09,750
them and so a lot of people think like,
Hey,

2573
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:13,050
if I just got on the podcast,
that would make my career totally,

2574
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:18,200
you know,
whether they're a singer or they have a 

2575
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:18,450
book or this,
it just gets too annoying.

2576
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:21,090
It's just,
it's too overwhelming.

2577
01:49:21,240 --> 01:49:24,030
But the meet and greet is actually like 
it's part of your brand,

2578
01:49:24,031 --> 01:49:24,530
I feel like,
like,

2579
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:25,390
seriously.
Yeah,

2580
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,500
definitely.
It's like when we did,

2581
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:30,070
we did the Chicago theater run with 
Macondo and nate and all those guys.

2582
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:32,170
Yeah.
Know,

2583
01:49:32,210 --> 01:49:35,140
just um,
I uh,

2584
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,990
like it.
None of the,

2585
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:38,320
none of the guys wanted to do meet and 
greet and I.

2586
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,930
There was like a thousand people waiting
outside the theater and I thought,

2587
01:49:41,110 --> 01:49:46,110
I just thought,
but that's different because that's who 

2588
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:46,110
I am.
Like if I go see a band I am,

2589
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:51,240
I am like super compelled to go talk to 
them and tell them how great I thought 

2590
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:52,420
they were.
Part of that is who I am.

2591
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:57,630
And so I went out and did pictures with 
everyone waiting in the alley at the 

2592
01:49:57,630 --> 01:49:58,660
Chicago theater and I was like.
And then when someone goes,

2593
01:49:58,661 --> 01:49:59,470
dude,
you have no idea.

2594
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:01,210
I love the podcast.
I love Tommy.

2595
01:50:01,211 --> 01:50:02,460
I love the weight loss.
I beat,

2596
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:04,270
you know,
I love that interaction.

2597
01:50:04,271 --> 01:50:06,970
I remember one time I was in Scotland 
and I was like,

2598
01:50:07,150 --> 01:50:07,930
I just hit it out.
Hey,

2599
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:09,820
is anyone any fans when you go have a 
beer with me?

2600
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:15,060
And these three guys showed up and it 
was right when bobcat was on your 

2601
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:15,730
podcast and we just bullshitted about 
bobcat appearance.

2602
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,440
We'd all listen to it.
So,

2603
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:18,340
you know,
I think I,

2604
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:23,580
but I don't know what I'd like to maybe 
charge only like weed out the people 

2605
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:23,980
that don't want to,
you know.

2606
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:25,240
Yeah.
But see there's the problem,

2607
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:30,510
I'm not,
I'm philosophically opposed to making 

2608
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:32,830
people pay for pictures and making 
people pay to hang out with you.

2609
01:50:32,831 --> 01:50:34,090
I just don't think it's right.

2610
01:50:34,250 --> 01:50:37,200
But there should be a way to like just.
Yeah,

2611
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:39,260
but there's this thin the herd is a 
thing unless you

2612
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:44,370
charged money or pick people.
So like there's a company now that does 

2613
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:48,541
that.
They do these vip things and someone 

2614
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:48,541
brought it up to me and like you could 
make this.

2615
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:49,180
I'm like,
I'm not doing it.

2616
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:50,760
And they go,
but you could make someone stop.

2617
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:53,320
I'm not doing it.
I mean I used to do it for free forever.

2618
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,990
I stopped doing it because too many 
people got too weird.

2619
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:59,020
But I'm not going to charge people.
I'm just not going to do it.

2620
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:04,140
But I know a lot of fucking people that 
do a lot of people and they make a lot 

2621
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:05,230
of money doing it.
You used to do it right?

2622
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:06,930
What the ingredient?
Yeah.

2623
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:08,260
I used to also feel like,
you know,

2624
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:10,330
honestly like I,
I like meeting people.

2625
01:51:10,331 --> 01:51:15,331
I a people on the street and meet them 
when I walk out of the back of the 

2626
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:16,330
venue.
I always,

2627
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:17,920
there's people there.
I always meet people,

2628
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,450
but I just don't.
I don't,

2629
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:22,780
I'm not that good at the meet and greet.
I'm just not that comfortable with it.

2630
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:23,680
I don't like it that much.

2631
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:25,060
The is definitely not.
I mean,

2632
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:27,190
in not being shitty,
but it's not you.

2633
01:51:27,191 --> 01:51:27,940
You're not like,

2634
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:33,110
I'm not very social people that there's,
there's people that are demanding and 

2635
01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:33,600
they're like,
oh,

2636
01:51:33,601 --> 01:51:37,040
you don't love your fans because it's 
not true extra thing from now.

2637
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:37,710
No,
no,

2638
01:51:37,711 --> 01:51:38,910
no.
Here's the arrangement.

2639
01:51:38,970 --> 01:51:41,760
The range of Nez.
I work hard on my act.

2640
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:43,530
I do a lot of sets.
I prepare.

2641
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:45,300
Take the show very seriously.
Uh,

2642
01:51:45,301 --> 01:51:47,310
come to town.
I try to do a kick ass show.

2643
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:49,560
That's the arrangement.
Thank you.

2644
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:51,360
Goodnight.
Are Our deals done?

2645
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:56,600
And now if you think that you have to 
tell me some fucking life story for 20 

2646
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:57,320
minutes or I'm not your friend.
Like,

2647
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:59,670
no,
this is not the arrangement.

2648
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:04,671
This is not like you're demanding too 
much and you're also not aware of how 

2649
01:52:04,671 --> 01:52:05,190
many other people would want to do the 
same thing.

2650
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,550
Like it would be impossible.
It's just,

2651
01:52:07,551 --> 01:52:09,330
it's untenable.
You can't do it.

2652
01:52:09,331 --> 01:52:10,730
There's too many.
I would say that for me,

2653
01:52:10,731 --> 01:52:13,860
like anybody who wants to wait outside 
that door,

2654
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:16,890
I'll meet anybody to.
She fucked up.

2655
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:21,910
Son shouldn't have said that.
That was a mistake that they're not 

2656
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:22,020
going to wait.
They're coming right now.

2657
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:27,680
There was one thing.
They have a little trailer out there 

2658
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:27,680
right now.
Tom's a

2659
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:30,260
or so it's amazing that we're friends 
because we're so very different.

2660
01:52:30,261 --> 01:52:31,670
Men.
Uh,

2661
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:36,700
there was once a comment on his 
instagram that made me laugh so hard 

2662
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:37,140
compared to my comments.
It was a,

2663
01:52:37,160 --> 01:52:42,160
Hey Tom,
I'm really sorry for looking at you at 

2664
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:42,750
the airport.
They said,

2665
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:43,910
I'm sorry.
I said,

2666
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:46,340
Hi Heidi with the airport.
Yeah,

2667
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:49,220
but it's just Tom's face just like he 
is.

2668
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:51,380
He's not needy.
That's what it is.

2669
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:53,540
And so when some guy said,
hi Tom on high,

2670
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,340
and then the guys didn't know what to 
say,

2671
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:56,040
I walked away.

2672
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:56,960
Ah,
he,

2673
01:52:56,990 --> 01:52:58,310
he came out.
I still remember it.

2674
01:52:58,360 --> 01:53:03,360
I was Atlanta airport.
He came over as I was about to take the 

2675
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:05,770
escalator at,
at Hartsfield Jackson and he,

2676
01:53:05,930 --> 01:53:06,590
he goes,
Hey,

2677
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:07,280
I'm a big fan.
Like,

2678
01:53:07,281 --> 01:53:10,100
oh hey man.
And it was like a quick thing and he was

2679
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:11,300
like,
big fan.

2680
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:11,990
I go,
thanks a lot.

2681
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:13,750
Appreciate it.
Got on the son.

2682
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:15,590
Never thought twice.
And then he wrote,

2683
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:18,170
I'm sorry that I bothered you at the 
airport.

2684
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:19,980
And I was like,
you didn't bother me at all.

2685
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:25,040
It was just,
that's just someone who's trying to get 

2686
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:25,460
a reaction from you.
He's not really sorry.

2687
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,920
And also there was nothing to be sorry 
for,

2688
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:30,050
you know,
I felt he was like,

2689
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,490
he just wants to keep it going.
Right.

2690
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,630
I'm sorry,
don't be sorry.

2691
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:33,260
Can I hang out with you?

2692
01:53:33,290 --> 01:53:38,290
Right.
But Bert.

2693
01:53:39,101 --> 01:53:40,590
Yeah.
No one would ever apologized.

2694
01:53:40,650 --> 01:53:42,220
I was at the,
I was at the hotel,

2695
01:53:42,221 --> 01:53:47,221
did Bella tours going on this weekend in
San Jose and so it was all fucking 

2696
01:53:47,221 --> 01:53:47,221
fighters.
Right.

2697
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,510
I ran,
I ran into Jay big John McCarthy.

2698
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:50,110
Oh,
okay.

2699
01:53:50,111 --> 01:53:51,430
The elevator.
What a great guy.

2700
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:52,390
Great Guy Too.
He was like,

2701
01:53:52,590 --> 01:53:54,310
I knew who he was,
but I didn't want to.

2702
01:53:54,311 --> 01:53:56,430
Like I was afraid I just working out and
he was like a.

2703
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:57,610
It was like,
hi.

2704
01:53:57,650 --> 01:53:59,260
I just got done working out and I was 
like,

2705
01:53:59,261 --> 01:54:04,261
yeah,
I wouldn't want to bother me because we 

2706
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:04,261
have a mutual friend.
And I was like,

2707
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:04,261
does he know who I am?
He was like,

2708
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:04,450
Joe Rogan.
And I went,

2709
01:54:04,451 --> 01:54:06,370
I know exactly who the fuck you are.
And then,

2710
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:10,720
uh,
but a big cock speak fellow.

2711
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:11,170
No,
no,

2712
01:54:11,171 --> 01:54:12,580
John,
that's a different guy.

2713
01:54:12,640 --> 01:54:16,060
I'm sure John has a big dick to moose 
kind of fucking the hammer.

2714
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:20,440
When did you see Musashi deck in the 
fucking sauna?

2715
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:22,970
You saw his dick,
dude.

2716
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:27,990
It was legit.
Of course he called me about it because 

2717
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:31,620
I didn't see it

2718
01:54:31,710 --> 01:54:36,710
fight because the fights on some new 
streaming thing called dayson that it's 

2719
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:42,220
called the zone they have.
But then the name is with Michael 

2720
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:42,220
Buffer.
It's pretty good.

2721
01:54:42,220 --> 01:54:44,480
They have a commercial about how dumb.
How do you spell it?

2722
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:45,370
D,
a c,

2723
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:48,180
n the zone and it's about.
He's joking about.

2724
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,580
I noticed soon.
It's called the zone yet,

2725
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,040
what's called what?
But it's not zone.

2726
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,280
There's no.
Oh Hey man.

2727
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:56,990
He can't change how people pronounce 
things phonetically.

2728
01:54:56,991 --> 01:55:01,991
That's stupid.
So I'm probably made it and it got 

2729
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:01,991
stuck.
Well,

2730
01:55:01,991 --> 01:55:02,180
a blue saucy just beat the shit out of 
Rory Macdonald.

2731
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:07,210
Stopped him in the second round.
I didn't even get a chance to see it 

2732
01:55:07,210 --> 01:55:09,371
because I thought it was going to be on 
TV and so I went to check my Bella tour 

2733
01:55:09,371 --> 01:55:12,290
on my dvr and it wasn't even there,
but he beat him with his Dick.

2734
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:19,080
Pick it.
I don't know how I got to cut weight 

2735
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:19,080
without cooking hog on it.
Wow.

2736
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:21,490
That's.
I want to see that footage now.

2737
01:55:23,260 --> 01:55:25,960
How big?
A 10 inches.

2738
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,780
I'll tell you what it is.
It's bigger than this.

2739
01:55:30,150 --> 01:55:31,660
Fat,
fatter than a water bottle.

2740
01:55:38,770 --> 01:55:43,770
I'll tell you right now.
No certain point in time you dick 

2741
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:43,770
becomes a liability when it's as fat as 
a water.

2742
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:43,980
I don't

2743
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,980
know what.
I don't know how we brought that into 

2744
01:55:48,980 --> 01:55:50,691
the ring with him.
Like every girl needs probably 

2745
01:55:50,691 --> 01:55:51,930
unsatisfied.
Totally.

2746
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,760
As soon as they pull it out,
they're like,

2747
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:55,980
hold on a second,
get out of here out.

2748
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:58,080
And he's like,
he's always one 72.

2749
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:03,510
He was weighed one 72 that day because I
got on the scale after he did know he 

2750
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,080
weighs more than that.
He fights it one 85.

2751
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:09,350
He cuts wait to get to one 85.
He used to be a light heavyweight 

2752
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:12,321
champion,
so he used to be fighting it maybe a 

2753
01:56:12,321 --> 01:56:12,321
little too.
The thing wrong,

2754
01:56:12,321 --> 01:56:14,970
maybe it looks at the school and I think
the scale was off because I said I'm 

2755
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:18,081
going to say this now that I said that 
once you weighed one 95 to 30,

2756
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:24,520
something could make one 72.
He would destroy everyone in the 

2757
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:25,650
welterweight division.
He's a murderer.

2758
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:27,510
Is that how you say his name?
Big Gardens.

2759
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:32,530
Saucy.
I thought it was Gerald mean dyslexic 

2760
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:32,530
person.
Nope,

2761
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:34,890
I'm dyslexic.
So one of the things when I read things,

2762
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:37,530
I don't see it right away.
He's a monster man.

2763
01:56:37,531 --> 01:56:42,531
He's one of the big losses for the UFC 
because in my opinion is one of the top 

2764
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:46,260
two or 385 pounds in the world at the 
UFC had beaten Chris Weidman and then he

2765
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:51,261
goes over and fights in beltour now,
but apparently they just came up with 

2766
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:56,091
some large cash.
They're trying to get big names over 

2767
01:56:56,091 --> 01:56:56,091
there either.
I mean,

2768
01:56:56,091 --> 01:56:59,740
I don't know.
I don't know anything about UFC is no 

2769
01:56:59,740 --> 01:56:59,790
hammer me about that,
but like do tours really cool.

2770
01:56:59,791 --> 01:57:01,680
Just being down there.
It was like Chael Sonnen,

2771
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,250
rampage Jackson,
like fifty cent was there.

2772
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,330
It was like a really like,
uh,

2773
01:57:06,331 --> 01:57:06,930
if,
if,

2774
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:10,830
if you're a passer by failure of mma,
then you're like,

2775
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,090
oh,
shut the fuck up.

2776
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:14,880
They're doing really good fights.
They have big.

2777
01:57:15,030 --> 01:57:18,840
They have big talent there.
Now they have Michael Chandler who's one

2778
01:57:18,841 --> 01:57:22,830
of the top light weights in the world.
Rory Macdonald is one of the best,

2779
01:57:22,831 --> 01:57:24,540
if not the best welterweight in the 
world.

2780
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:26,760
He's definitely top two or three.
He's beaten.

2781
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:28,770
Tyron Woodley,
who's the UFC champion,

2782
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:31,440
who I think is the best rory.
They snagged over them right?

2783
01:57:31,441 --> 01:57:34,040
They snagged him,
they have underlay.

2784
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:37,980
Silva is that habit vandelays way past 
his prime and so his rampage,

2785
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:39,190
you know those guys,
they,

2786
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:44,220
they,
they're doing the legends tour and 

2787
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:46,010
rampage just knocked out family,
but vandelay doesn't look good anymore 

2788
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:48,330
and they should let them choose.
Let them choose.

2789
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:52,530
But you know,
they're doing a great job.

2790
01:57:53,010 --> 01:57:54,510
They're doing a great job.
They're really,

2791
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:59,690
they're promoting these fights well.
They're putting on and the welterweight 

2792
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:03,771
division they have.
Douglas Lema was one of the best in 

2793
01:58:03,771 --> 01:58:03,771
world.

2794
01:58:03,771 --> 01:58:05,370
They have a Paul Daley who can knock out
any living human being.

2795
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:09,600
They have Lorenz Larkin.
Fifty cent was given away a cash prize.

2796
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:11,790
Hazers Trey Whoa.
Got into the steam room.

2797
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:14,760
Was fifty cent.
What does it has to award Bella tour?

2798
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:17,370
What does it say?
Welterweight Grand Prize winner.

2799
01:58:17,371 --> 01:58:19,920
A million dollar cash prize.
Didn't he just go bankrupt?

2800
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:24,780
50 of this part of a deal he had with 
the get the strap brand,

2801
01:58:24,781 --> 01:58:26,820
which I guess he owned,
owned and sold.

2802
01:58:26,821 --> 01:58:28,900
And part of that money is going into 
this.

2803
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,490
A million dollars goes to give the 
person a million dollar cash prize.

2804
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,400
So the welterweight grand prixs that 
they had koresh cough,

2805
01:58:35,401 --> 01:58:38,550
just fought Lima.
Those two guys are excellent to Koresh.

2806
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:41,650
Cough is another top 10 guy in the world
I think.

2807
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:44,500
And he's fighting for Bella to Lima,
beat him.

2808
01:58:44,680 --> 01:58:49,600
Lima and rory had a great fight.
Rory beat Lima by decision.

2809
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,090
So there's Rory Douglas,
Lema,

2810
01:58:52,120 --> 01:58:54,510
Paul Daley,
and still to this day like Paul Dale,

2811
01:58:54,511 --> 01:58:55,450
he can knock out anyone.

2812
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,980
He's so fucking dangerous.
A puncher I'll just do is.

2813
01:58:59,170 --> 01:59:01,480
He's got a left hand that's just a 
nuclear missile.

2814
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:04,330
So.
And he just knocked out Lorenz Larkin,

2815
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:07,930
who is also a top welterweight.
There's so many good fighters over there

2816
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:12,931
now.
There's so many good fighters in 

2817
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:12,931
general.
Yeah,

2818
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:12,931
yeah,
yeah.

2819
01:59:12,931 --> 01:59:13,180
It's A.
MMA is coming up right now.

2820
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:18,240
I mean there's the top talents.
This fucking fight this weekend between 

2821
01:59:18,240 --> 01:59:21,940
Mcgregor and Khabib.
Gunmen off is going to be crazy.

2822
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:24,130
That is a crazy fight.
That's Vegas,

2823
01:59:24,131 --> 01:59:24,700
right?
Yup.

2824
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:27,400
That is a fucking crazy.
Because on that.

2825
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:32,420
Yup.
I don't know what the fuck's going to 

2826
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:32,420
happen.
Are you excited?

2827
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:32,420
Yeah.
I don't want to lose that.

2828
01:59:32,890 --> 01:59:37,890
I wish I wasn't going on this cruise.
I would totally hit you up for tickets 

2829
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:37,890
yet man.
I'm super excited.

2830
01:59:37,890 --> 01:59:38,500
Speaking of which on this,
on this bet,

2831
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,030
this is just.
Do you think you can get us free tickets

2832
01:59:42,031 --> 01:59:47,031
to like so we can take that out of the 
cash prizes because that would really 

2833
01:59:47,031 --> 01:59:47,770
want to go where I send you free tickets
for the UFC.

2834
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:53,660
Do you think they do.
I think we could leverage you to get us 

2835
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:57,331
tickets to a boxing match for sure.
We can get some tickets as opposed to 

2836
01:59:57,331 --> 01:59:59,080
putting that all except I.
That may make the prize right.

2837
01:59:59,081 --> 02:00:01,060
If it's.
If it's like,

2838
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:02,010
you know.
Right.

2839
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,710
Right.
So

2840
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:04,840
maybe I'll get the tickets for the 
fight.

2841
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:09,841
I'll use leverage to get the tickets and
then we'll make a big deal that we're 

2842
02:00:09,841 --> 02:00:13,561
going to go and then we'll get like 
sweets at some hotel somewhere and the 

2843
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:17,140
loser has to pay for like some 
extravagant meal.

2844
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:17,500
And

2845
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:20,870
hold on.
We got flights and lodging.

2846
02:00:20,871 --> 02:00:22,730
I'm going to be on the bat and then.
And then

2847
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:24,050
private,
private jet.

2848
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,930
That's the way to do it.
What are we going to Vegas?

2849
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:28,310
Yeah,
if it's a.

2850
02:00:28,311 --> 02:00:33,311
If it's fun,
I don't wanna go to Tokyo for some 

2851
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:33,311
fucking stupid fight.
Yeah,

2852
02:00:33,311 --> 02:00:36,470
let's go private debt.
Private jet into Vegas because he's 

2853
02:00:36,470 --> 02:00:38,711
talking about fighting this guy that's 
not manny Pacquiao in Tokyo.

2854
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:41,180
He's not talking about fighting Manny 
Pacquiao,

2855
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:43,160
fight Manny Pacquiao.
He's going to fight him in Vegas.

2856
02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:45,110
That's where the real money is.
You're going to end up spending a lot of

2857
02:00:45,111 --> 02:00:50,111
money.
Should we get matching so you think 

2858
02:00:50,111 --> 02:00:50,111
you're going to lose?
No,

2859
02:00:50,111 --> 02:00:50,111
I'm not gonna lose.
There's no way to win the whole thing.

2860
02:00:50,111 --> 02:00:54,260
I think you're going to come in like if 
it's your fantasy that you come in at 

2861
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:55,410
the end and you win the whole thing.
Cinderella story should work out with me

2862
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:57,590
once he killed those fantasies.

2863
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:05,150
I want to know.
I learned to what you think you're going

2864
02:01:05,151 --> 02:01:06,170
to get.
Do it.

2865
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:08,100
I've got a page of numbers right here.
Okay.

2866
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:13,160
What do you think is going to want to 
unfriend you now so that you can't see 

2867
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,160
my track?
So you should see mine.

2868
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:20,260
Yours is scaring me.
I know what I have to do now when I go 

2869
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:20,260
home tonight.

2870
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:20,260
So wait,
let me understand,

2871
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:23,620
what do you think you're going to get?
Because I want to know what do you think

2872
02:01:23,621 --> 02:01:26,080
you're going to get because you're good 
at calling the shots.

2873
02:01:26,170 --> 02:01:31,170
So.
Well Tom has already achieved more in a 

2874
02:01:31,170 --> 02:01:33,730
day then my first workout.
You've already achieved 2:30,

2875
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:34,480
you said it was the most

2876
02:01:35,190 --> 02:01:38,590
most I've ever done in a day is three 83
$80 a day.

2877
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:39,470
Yeah.
Is that two a day?

2878
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:40,480
Yeah.
Wow.

2879
02:01:41,110 --> 02:01:44,110
Actually I'm sorry it's more than that.
Three 80 in one workout.

2880
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:46,390
But that was.
But that was,

2881
02:01:46,630 --> 02:01:51,630
how did you do that?
Seven miles and I did mostly uphill and 

2882
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:54,670
then I went around and like,
so it was a hike run,

2883
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:59,760
right.
So sustained heart rate for for a long 

2884
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:00,920
period of time.
Oh you guys are fucked.

2885
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:04,640
And when I wear this elk hunting so you 
guys will never get.

2886
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:06,880
I'll get $500 a day.
Oh,

2887
02:02:06,881 --> 02:02:08,340
you'll do more than that.
Actually.

2888
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:13,410
You guys actually going on like top top,
top workout or like most single day.

2889
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:18,550
Single Day on that day.
So you could do,

2890
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:23,700
you know,
let's say a hike like that or run and 

2891
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,481
then go back and go like,
oh I want to get like another 100 

2892
02:02:27,481 --> 02:02:28,150
points.
I'm going to go on this.

2893
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:30,740
How long was this battery go for?
Long time.

2894
02:02:31,120 --> 02:02:32,290
Fully charged for a week.

2895
02:02:33,540 --> 02:02:34,360
Yeah.
Really?

2896
02:02:34,780 --> 02:02:39,780
Yeah.
I didn't charge mine for a second time 

2897
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:40,780
until after I had it for over seven 
months for all skeptical people.

2898
02:02:40,870 --> 02:02:42,610
This is not a sponsor.
No.

2899
02:02:42,611 --> 02:02:45,550
We don't know anybody that works at this
company and I don't want.

2900
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:48,550
We talked about it in text messages.
I said we should do this punk rock.

2901
02:02:48,551 --> 02:02:50,050
I don't want to.
We shouldn't do this.

2902
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:52,440
We shouldn't have a company sponsor.
There's no.

2903
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:54,490
We just.
This is a good metric.

2904
02:02:54,491 --> 02:02:57,100
System should product.
We're going to use it because of that.

2905
02:02:57,101 --> 02:02:59,230
And I don't want it.
I don't want him to sponsor us.

2906
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:01,960
So this is non sponsored.
This is.

2907
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:04,840
And if it's a piece of shit we're going 
to get to say it's a piece of shit.

2908
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:07,240
Yeah.
So just so

2909
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:10,960
people fucking with corporate.
I like these side effects.

2910
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:12,460
I like the part right now.
It's like,

2911
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:13,920
Oh God,
I wish you do sponsor.

2912
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:15,460
No,
I'll try and John wounds,

2913
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:19,080
wounds,
Boser will fly me out to pick show song.

2914
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:21,880
Yang is a nice place.
You know,

2915
02:03:21,881 --> 02:03:26,881
I do it for real.
If they hit me up and then I'd probably.

2916
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,130
But why would you want to do that?
Why would you want to go to?

2917
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:31,270
Oh No,
it's about the stories I like.

2918
02:03:31,271 --> 02:03:33,010
I like,
I like crazy stuff like that.

2919
02:03:33,011 --> 02:03:35,830
I think that's a good story is 
definitely on brand.

2920
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,920
Most single day workout a gets a new 
suit.

2921
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:40,930
Okay,
that's good.

2922
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:44,260
And all three of us have to buy them a 
new suit or you just texted what?

2923
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:46,340
What'd you say?
How do I register this thing?

2924
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:49,760
We got to fucking Pansy.
He means he's in.

2925
02:03:49,790 --> 02:03:51,390
He's in man.
Wow.

2926
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:53,200
Ari's in two.
Okay.

2927
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:56,540
Most single day gets to compete,
but he doesn't exercise.

2928
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:57,710
Oh,
you know what's so great.

2929
02:03:57,711 --> 02:04:02,711
Most single days to shoot and we're 
going to be in the best shape of our 

2930
02:04:02,711 --> 02:04:02,711
lives so we get a skinny suit that will 
never be able to wear again.

2931
02:04:02,740 --> 02:04:03,490
Yeah,
we should write.

2932
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,970
He has to email them for facility code.
It's easy.

2933
02:04:06,971 --> 02:04:08,050
They get it.
They'll send it right away.

2934
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:12,220
You're right.
We should wear suits to the gig.

2935
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:13,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

2936
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:14,980
Oh,
I've never even had a suit.

2937
02:04:15,130 --> 02:04:16,450
Alright.
Yeah.

2938
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:17,890
Well,
you know what we'll do.

2939
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,680
I'll contact David August.
Are the guys who make my suits.

2940
02:04:21,620 --> 02:04:22,580
You suits.
Yeah,

2941
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:24,160
I know David.
August.

2942
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:27,160
Yeah.
They make awesome suits made.

2943
02:04:27,161 --> 02:04:28,690
It's got like a little bit of flex to 
it.

2944
02:04:28,691 --> 02:04:31,750
So if you're built like a troll like me,
he can move around in these things.

2945
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:33,400
There's a flex around their belly.
Yes.

2946
02:04:33,401 --> 02:04:34,340
Everything.
What's that?

2947
02:04:34,670 --> 02:04:36,400
Thomas got a suit guy.
You got a suit guy?

2948
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:37,800
Yeah.
But David is.

2949
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:42,970
Yeah,
he makes conor Mcgregor's when Tom got 

2950
02:04:42,970 --> 02:04:47,361
his fat suit with Chad,
Chad Daniels and God and they went and 

2951
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:55,220
got suits.
Does that it?

2952
02:04:55,330 --> 02:04:55,770
Yeah.
Yeah,

2953
02:04:55,771 --> 02:05:00,771
yeah.
There was a documentary called I need 

2954
02:05:00,771 --> 02:05:01,290
you to kill that I'm in,
which it's on Amazon prime and there's a

2955
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:01,880
scene

2956
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:07,100
in the documentary where we go and we 
get a suits made and um,

2957
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:09,390
yeah,
the,

2958
02:05:09,950 --> 02:05:12,330
I go with chat and it's really,
really fun man.

2959
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:12,900
I mean,
yeah.

2960
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:17,901
I went to the same district that Ari got
his maiden and that Guy Danny,

2961
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:24,530
I went to Danny.
They always have like the names are 

2962
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:27,501
really sitting there like,
did you get yours at Joe's or Danny's 

2963
02:05:27,501 --> 02:05:28,840
like,
that's the designers there.

2964
02:05:28,841 --> 02:05:28,920
Right,

2965
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:30,230
so they do a great job,
man.

2966
02:05:30,260 --> 02:05:32,470
First place was for nothing,
so I can place a

2967
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:38,190
most single day gets a brand new suit.
Should we do third place plays,

2968
02:05:38,191 --> 02:05:40,600
lodging.
Fourth place pays for flights and we fly

2969
02:05:40,601 --> 02:05:42,000
private.
I like it.

2970
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:47,420
I like that man.
Are you going to have to pay for a 

2971
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:47,420
flight?
You're going to play lodging.

2972
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:47,420
Yeah.
Right.

2973
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:49,590
Second place has got to pay for 
something.

2974
02:05:49,591 --> 02:05:50,520
What's second place,
but I said,

2975
02:05:50,530 --> 02:05:51,540
well,
who's got to pay for whatever?

2976
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:53,460
The second dinner.
One big nowhere.

2977
02:05:53,461 --> 02:05:55,140
I don't know.
Lodging might be more than dinner.

2978
02:05:56,130 --> 02:06:00,660
Big Dinner.
We could ball the crazier dinner bottles

2979
02:06:00,661 --> 02:06:02,700
of wine for a thousand bucks.
You realize if I'm in,

2980
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:08,390
Oh my God,
that won't get in panic because I know 

2981
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:08,390
that I'm going to be wanting to drink it
there.

2982
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:09,120
I tell you about the dinner I went to 
Ralphie with.

2983
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,480
Ralphie may,
me and Ralph,

2984
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:14,940
he went to dinner with our families.
This is one of my favorite stories.

2985
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,040
We'd been.
We'd been partying all weekend.

2986
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:18,200
And this is Hawaii?
No,

2987
02:06:18,210 --> 02:06:19,870
this is a Bahamas.
Okay.

2988
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:20,980
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2989
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:24,840
But you got to set it up that at the 
time you're like,

2990
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:27,020
middling or just.
Yeah,

2991
02:06:27,130 --> 02:06:30,190
that was a feature act.
How many years ago is this a,

2992
02:06:30,700 --> 02:06:33,240
it's just leanna and his first trip away
from Georgia.

2993
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:36,030
So it's from our daughter.
Ten years plus.

2994
02:06:36,031 --> 02:06:37,500
It's got to be at least 10,
10,

2995
02:06:37,501 --> 02:06:39,330
11 years.
You can actually find it if you can.

2996
02:06:39,390 --> 02:06:41,400
It's on my video because I posted a 
video at that time.

2997
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:44,350
So it's probably 2007 maybe before 
trial.

2998
02:06:44,351 --> 02:06:47,220
What happened before I started birth to 
conquer,

2999
02:06:47,221 --> 02:06:50,280
I was 37 years old.
Thirty six years old at the time.

3000
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:51,110
Ralph,
he's killing it.

3001
02:06:51,260 --> 02:06:56,260
He's balling.
I'm headlining some maybe for like 1500 

3002
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:56,260
bucks.
2,000

3003
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:56,940
bucks.
I'm headlining and,

3004
02:06:56,941 --> 02:06:58,440
but I'm,
I'm still featuring at the time.

3005
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:04,140
Um,
and so maybe I'd done jamison comedy 

3006
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:04,140
tours.

3007
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:04,140
That was.
So I had a little bit of money,

3008
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:05,190
but not much.
No money to speak of,

3009
02:07:05,670 --> 02:07:10,670
so we go to the do this Gig for Paul and
Young Ron and the first night there we 

3010
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:11,190
go out to eat and it's a huge dinner and
I'm like,

3011
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:12,240
how much do I owe?
And I was like,

3012
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:13,590
oh player,
you know,

3013
02:07:13,591 --> 02:07:15,630
I got that Bert Kreischer don't worry 
about it.

3014
02:07:15,631 --> 02:07:16,420
You just,
you,

3015
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,970
you only have a great weekend.
I said,

3016
02:07:17,971 --> 02:07:19,030
no,
I got to pay for.

3017
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:19,550
So I'm like,
Nah,

3018
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:21,810
don't even read your why when you're 
wrapping around.

3019
02:07:21,811 --> 02:07:22,530
Moving around.
We May.

3020
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:24,660
So we go out that night,
everyone goes drinking,

3021
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,910
we have a great time.
The next night we go out to eat,

3022
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,860
everyone goes out to eat and Ralphie 
wants again.

3023
02:07:28,861 --> 02:07:30,360
I go to pay for when he goes,
oh,

3024
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:35,400
playboy,
you know you don't mind is no good 

3025
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:35,400
around me.

3026
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:35,400
Just come on.
We didn't have a good time.

3027
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:36,880
We go do a show,
an amazing fucking show.

3028
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:38,980
We'd go out drinking again.
Rafi picks up everything.

3029
02:07:38,981 --> 02:07:43,720
The last night there we go to Sushi at 
Nobu and Leanne says,

3030
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:44,620
you can't live off.
He pay.

3031
02:07:44,621 --> 02:07:46,000
You got to pick up the bill.
And I went,

3032
02:07:46,001 --> 02:07:51,001
okay,
so I go over to the lady before before,

3033
02:07:51,641 --> 02:07:53,110
um,
I'm going to screw up numbers,

3034
02:07:53,111 --> 02:07:58,111
I'll tell you that right now.
But I go over to the lady before the 

3035
02:07:58,111 --> 02:07:58,111
bill comes and I go,
hey,

3036
02:07:58,111 --> 02:07:58,111
the big guys not paying,
here's my credit card.

3037
02:07:58,250 --> 02:07:59,080
She's like,
okay.

3038
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:02,830
So we eat and I drink and we eat and I 
drink.

3039
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:04,530
And was getting like boats,
right?

3040
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:05,770
Boats.
They're just like,

3041
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:06,610
wow,
you know,

3042
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:09,400
I mean they brought out 50 pieces who 
she,

3043
02:08:09,740 --> 02:08:12,070
they're like a cool deaton,
dolphins and so,

3044
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:17,700
and I am doing Saki bomb after Saki bomb
and the lady comes with the check and 

3045
02:08:17,711 --> 02:08:19,390
it's like $2,000.

3046
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:23,650
I did not have $2,000
and I did not.

3047
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:25,420
I didn't have enough money to,
for the tip.

3048
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:27,190
Like I didn't.
I was like,

3049
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,310
why'd you think you could pay?
I didn't know what the bill would be.

3050
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:31,840
I don't,
I've never paid attention to that stuff.

3051
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:34,090
I didn't know what I just.
Do you ever eat out?

3052
02:08:34,140 --> 02:08:34,500
No,
but I,

3053
02:08:34,530 --> 02:08:39,530
I didn't,
I wasn't paying attention to what the 

3054
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:39,530
bill would be.
I thought it would be 500 bucks,

3055
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:43,740
600.
I didn't know how expensive Sushi at 

3056
02:08:43,740 --> 02:08:43,740
Nobu was that everything is through the 
roof.

3057
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:48,370
She puts the check in front of me and I 
opened it up and I see it and I,

3058
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:52,540
I immediately freeze and leanne goes,
how much is it?

3059
02:08:52,590 --> 02:08:55,120
And just instinctually go fuck you.
That's how much it is.

3060
02:08:55,450 --> 02:08:58,890
And she goes and Ralphie fucking fucking
our shit.

3061
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:00,130
Gotcha.

3062
02:09:04,290 --> 02:09:05,680
I.
Then I go Ralph Ralph.

3063
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:06,670
He goes,
don't worry player.

3064
02:09:06,671 --> 02:09:11,671
We go out and win it back.
So I go to our bank machine and I put a 

3065
02:09:11,671 --> 02:09:13,240
thousand dollars and I go over and I put
it on black hits red,

3066
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:18,730
$3,000
matter of minutes late.

3067
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:20,080
Honestly,
snipes lied to you.

3068
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:22,160
We,
Leanne won't speak to me is probably one

3069
02:09:22,161 --> 02:09:24,520
of the biggest fights we've ever been 
in.

3070
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:27,460
Were fighting in the lobby and I'm 
hammered.

3071
02:09:27,461 --> 02:09:29,290
She's mad because you bet the extra 
money.

3072
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:30,550
No,
because I said fuck you.

3073
02:09:30,551 --> 02:09:35,551
That's how much it is.
Don't ever talk to me like you're my 

3074
02:09:35,551 --> 02:09:35,551
partner.
We're team don't.

3075
02:09:35,551 --> 02:09:36,280
If I go,
I didn't know what to say in the moment.

3076
02:09:36,281 --> 02:09:41,281
I it was,
it was more money than we had at the 

3077
02:09:41,281 --> 02:09:41,770
time that it was probably three weeks on
the road for me.

3078
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:45,160
Of course.
And then you gambled away a thousand.

3079
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:48,570
Like a fucking.
God said Mickey Mantle.

3080
02:09:48,571 --> 02:09:49,400
Gene.
Yeah.

3081
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:51,980
That's not me.
That's loop

3082
02:09:58,760 --> 02:09:59,700
my favorite part of this.

3083
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:02,400
It's just like,
you know that you got shamed,

3084
02:10:02,550 --> 02:10:04,290
you know.
That's what I love about it.

3085
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:06,150
What,
what makes you feel good about that?

3086
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:08,160
Just say it's my friend doing something 
stupid.

3087
02:10:12,350 --> 02:10:14,290
I got to run.
Actually I do.

3088
02:10:14,830 --> 02:10:19,020
We haven't worked this out right now.
So we have to bring ren on this.

3089
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:20,280
Right?
Because he can't,

3090
02:10:20,300 --> 02:10:22,510
can't have no say he couldn't be here 
right now.

3091
02:10:22,770 --> 02:10:23,850
Right now.
Okay.

3092
02:10:23,851 --> 02:10:24,540
Call them up.
Yeah.

3093
02:10:25,800 --> 02:10:29,310
Let's see if he answers.
So what's we call at the same time.

3094
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,770
He's.
I know he's answering.

3095
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:33,680
Let's see.

3096
02:10:35,450 --> 02:10:40,450
Stingy.
Do you get them dry and got

3097
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,860
do this fucking stupid thing.

3098
02:10:52,650 --> 02:10:54,670
Hey,
you're on speaker with Joe and Tom.

3099
02:10:54,671 --> 02:10:56,230
We can all hear you.
And we're doing.

3100
02:10:59,220 --> 02:11:00,940
You do not have consent to use my voice.

3101
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,120
Hey,
we're talking about the bet.

3102
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,310
Here's what we're thinking.
Right?

3103
02:11:08,610 --> 02:11:11,340
So with these mind zone,
a fitness trackers,

3104
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:16,970
a joe did 200 today,
he's planning on doing two days.

3105
02:11:16,980 --> 02:11:19,080
So we're thinking the person who gets 
the most,

3106
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:22,920
most calories,
most points burnt in a week.

3107
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:25,470
It doesn't have to pay for anything out 
of this challenge.

3108
02:11:25,471 --> 02:11:25,730
Okay.

3109
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:27,120
Running away from

3110
02:11:27,570 --> 02:11:29,640
everything.
Got a murder.

3111
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:32,980
My agents now calling shit.
No.

3112
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,510
So the bet is we're going to go away 
from.

3113
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:40,710
We're fighting.
We're going to a fight in Las Vegas.

3114
02:11:40,711 --> 02:11:45,711
Okay?
Joe Thinks he can get on your fucking 

3115
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:45,711
agent.
Don't be scared.

3116
02:11:46,010 --> 02:11:47,130
I don't know how to.
There we go.

3117
02:11:47,131 --> 02:11:52,131
Here we go.
First place you'll have to pay for 

3118
02:11:52,131 --> 02:11:52,500
nothing.
Second place would have to pay for.

3119
02:11:52,501 --> 02:11:57,501
We're thinking maybe one meal.
Third place will have to pay for 

3120
02:11:57,501 --> 02:11:57,930
lodging.
Just let me fucking finish.

3121
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:00,300
Third base will play for lodging.
Fourth place.

3122
02:12:00,301 --> 02:12:01,140
Oh,
play for

3123
02:12:01,340 --> 02:12:02,370
we finished.
I don't know.

3124
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,200
I don't know the terms are talking 
about.

3125
02:12:05,201 --> 02:12:06,610
So you've given me all the details or 
something.

3126
02:12:06,611 --> 02:12:11,611
I don't understand.
What you're doing is telling them what 

3127
02:12:11,611 --> 02:12:11,830
you're talking about.
And then give me the detail.

3128
02:12:12,930 --> 02:12:15,300
The person with the most fitness,
uh,

3129
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:18,660
points points for the month.
We'll get in first place the person with

3130
02:12:18,661 --> 02:12:22,320
the second most fitness points for 
second place and so on.

3131
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,800
Now there's a bet going on and the prize
is going to a big fight,

3132
02:12:28,110 --> 02:12:29,950
a big boxing,
big boxing match in,

3133
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:31,020
in Las Vegas.
There you go.

3134
02:12:31,680 --> 02:12:33,600
Yes.
First Place.

3135
02:12:33,601 --> 02:12:38,601
The person with the most fitness points 
for the month will not have to pay for 

3136
02:12:38,601 --> 02:12:39,540
one thing.
Second place.

3137
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:41,650
Begging for change on the corner of 
Lafayette Gun.

3138
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:44,370
No Monica,
no pubic hair.

3139
02:12:44,371 --> 02:12:47,140
Beard.
I'm done with all of those.

3140
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:51,560
Come on.
See?

3141
02:12:51,561 --> 02:12:53,270
I knew he would turn this into 
humiliation.

3142
02:12:53,300 --> 02:12:55,520
We all,
we all come on the losers face.

3143
02:12:55,521 --> 02:12:56,330
So that's part of it.

3144
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:00,760
The goblet fire

3145
02:13:00,950 --> 02:13:04,250
piss combined piss.
And I'm eating asparagus.

3146
02:13:04,710 --> 02:13:05,770
So Ari,
are you in?

3147
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:08,160
Are you in on the bed?

3148
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:13,590
I don't know if we're talking about 
fruit

3149
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:17,020
the weekend.
We have to figure out the weekend.

3150
02:13:17,290 --> 02:13:18,400
It's got to be a weekend.
Everyone can go.

3151
02:13:18,401 --> 02:13:19,660
Yeah,
we'll figure it out the weekend.

3152
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:21,250
It's uneventful.

3153
02:13:22,820 --> 02:13:23,560
Tell him this.

3154
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:25,430
Yeah,
but we're going to be high as fuck it.

3155
02:13:25,530 --> 02:13:27,990
It'll be fun and tell them this.
There's a belt involved.

3156
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:33,020
Oh yeah.
The winter gets a belt championship 

3157
02:13:33,020 --> 02:13:33,020
belt.
Sober October belt

3158
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:36,020
and you're going to have to defend it 
every year.

3159
02:13:36,200 --> 02:13:41,200
We're having it made and it's going to 
have pills on it with a line through it.

3160
02:13:41,510 --> 02:13:46,510
Heroin on it with a line through it.
The guy stuck in his own right.

3161
02:13:46,851 --> 02:13:51,851
A boxing match.
Why don't we do something we don't want 

3162
02:13:51,851 --> 02:13:51,851
to do.
We can.

3163
02:13:51,851 --> 02:13:52,120
We were going to go to see floyd 
mayweather.

3164
02:13:52,121 --> 02:13:53,300
The rematch.
Mandy pack.

3165
02:13:53,301 --> 02:13:54,650
Yeah.
We don't have to do it though,

3166
02:13:55,370 --> 02:13:57,070
but it'd be fun.
Take place.

3167
02:13:57,090 --> 02:14:02,090
Nine years ago.
It would be fun to be in Vegas with like

3168
02:14:02,661 --> 02:14:03,800
a gentleman.
Yeah.

3169
02:14:03,801 --> 02:14:05,660
We're all together.
We don't have to work.

3170
02:14:05,720 --> 02:14:10,720
We're just all there to.
We're going to smoke cigars like a 

3171
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:11,970
fucking gentleman.
When did that happen?

3172
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:14,810
I think it takes place sometime in 
December,

3173
02:14:14,811 --> 02:14:18,410
but they haven't made the date.
They haven't made the date yet.

3174
02:14:19,130 --> 02:14:22,190
You're in December.
You're gone all December.

3175
02:14:22,250 --> 02:14:26,420
Were you going European?
You're up in Israel.

3176
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:29,990
What if we go to a a good Bella tour 
event?

3177
02:14:31,360 --> 02:14:32,300
Well,
I don't have to work.

3178
02:14:32,750 --> 02:14:34,760
You want to go see a an MMA event?

3179
02:14:35,670 --> 02:14:40,670
Why are you take off and go see the UFC 
in the middle of this dance and we'll 

3180
02:14:40,670 --> 02:14:41,080
get high there.
We'll do a bunch of heroin this down.

3181
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:44,250
I came out.
I can't take off one.

3182
02:14:44,890 --> 02:14:49,890
I'll tell you one thing.
We can do one that I don't have to do 

3183
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:51,400
because I only do the big ones.
I don't do the ESPN ones and the.

3184
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:53,280
Some of the ESPN ones are going to be 
really big.

3185
02:14:53,370 --> 02:14:55,950
I could be in the audience for that.
Yeah,

3186
02:14:56,300 --> 02:14:57,240
let's do.
We can do that.

3187
02:14:57,750 --> 02:15:02,750
Okay.
Now we don't have to worry about 

3188
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:02,750
tickets.
Okay.

3189
02:15:02,750 --> 02:15:05,490
Alright.
The fourth place has to play for the 

3190
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:05,490
flight and we're flying private.

3191
02:15:09,200 --> 02:15:10,590
Yeah,
but just just to Vegas.

3192
02:15:10,591 --> 02:15:15,591
It's not a lot.
If it's Vegas event though,

3193
02:15:16,071 --> 02:15:18,210
I'm probably going to work at.
I'm going to be honest with you.

3194
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:23,270
Okay.
So it's just we have to be like fucking 

3195
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:23,270
New York.
It's not that much.

3196
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:23,270
Yeah.
Toronto.

3197
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:29,460
We'll have to figure out where it is.
So are you the registered look,

3198
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:35,360
we'll take care of that already.
I sent you an email if you email the 

3199
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:35,360
email,
I just sent you a text message.

3200
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:40,341
If you emailed that address,
they'll send you a facility code right 

3201
02:15:40,341 --> 02:15:41,080
away.
Some messaging.

3202
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:41,850
Yeah,
yeah,

3203
02:15:41,860 --> 02:15:42,190
yeah.
It'll.

3204
02:15:42,590 --> 02:15:46,830
It'll just sink.
Sent an email to support at.

3205
02:15:46,890 --> 02:15:50,400
I sent you all the details to say I need
a facility code.

3206
02:15:50,401 --> 02:15:52,770
Did you buy yours on Amazon?
Yeah,

3207
02:15:52,830 --> 02:15:53,700
me too.
Yeah,

3208
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,760
they didn't send me an facility code.
Are you in for a tiered financial bet 

3209
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:02,220
for a UFC event or joe doesn't have to 
work and

3210
02:16:03,230 --> 02:16:04,100
humiliation.

3211
02:16:06,370 --> 02:16:06,920
Okay,
let's.

3212
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:07,800
You know what?
Let's find it.

3213
02:16:07,801 --> 02:16:11,820
Let's find a sweet little spot of 
humiliation in this for the last place.

3214
02:16:12,300 --> 02:16:15,480
Last place has got.
There's a punishment involved.

3215
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:19,020
Got Drank piss.
Everybody's pissed.

3216
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:21,190
Oh No,
no,

3217
02:16:21,191 --> 02:16:22,590
no,
no goblet.

3218
02:16:22,890 --> 02:16:27,890
Oh No.
I know what you guys are fucking 

3219
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:27,890
friends.
Tommy.

3220
02:16:27,890 --> 02:16:30,190
They're like straight from the tap,
like a Yeti Tumbler.

3221
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:35,940
Let's keep it warm.
Yeah,

3222
02:16:35,941 --> 02:16:36,280
yeah,
yeah.

3223
02:16:36,410 --> 02:16:38,910
Hold on.
We're not really jre.

3224
02:16:38,911 --> 02:16:40,030
Tumbler.
Embow.

3225
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:43,650
We'll rewrite the pis champion on it.
This right here.

3226
02:16:43,651 --> 02:16:46,230
We'll keep it.
Always keep it on this table,

3227
02:16:46,410 --> 02:16:48,770
so we'll know that the person drank the 
other people's pissed.

3228
02:16:48,810 --> 02:16:50,540
I'd be like,
fucking forrest gump this month.

3229
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:54,240
Why don't you guys just come on my back.
That fear factor?

3230
02:16:54,270 --> 02:16:55,670
I'll drink a gallon of piss.
Right?

3231
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:58,020
You're not going to have to be the one 
drinking piss.

3232
02:16:58,050 --> 02:16:59,250
Wouldn't either.
Tom or Ari.

3233
02:16:59,251 --> 02:17:04,251
I'm worried about my friend Ari.
He doesn't believe that you could ever 

3234
02:17:04,251 --> 02:17:07,881
possibly witness this.
There's no way birtle even coming 

3235
02:17:07,881 --> 02:17:07,881
fucking third there.
No Way.

3236
02:17:07,881 --> 02:17:08,880
What do you think of this?
Sorry.

3237
02:17:09,770 --> 02:17:12,020
Really for sure.
What?

3238
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,650
You're going to a days and.

3239
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,250
But what about,
what about burt's Mickey Mantle Gene?

3240
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:21,130
Uh,
that would help them.

3241
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:22,830
Or you're on the road a lot or no?

3242
02:17:23,450 --> 02:17:25,360
Yeah,
I'm on a cruise next year.

3243
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:27,280
Oh,
that's good.

3244
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:29,100
You can run on a boat.
I'm going to.

3245
02:17:29,630 --> 02:17:32,340
I'm trying to get burt to die.
Trying to keep up with me.

3246
02:17:33,810 --> 02:17:35,210
It is.
I'm doing four days.

3247
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:36,470
Good luck.

3248
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:37,520
Yeah,
you're afforded.

3249
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:39,400
Okay.
Their corresponding.

3250
02:17:42,390 --> 02:17:43,680
Here's the important thing.
Let's see.

3251
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:45,230
Something that we can all get behind.
What?

3252
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:48,890
What,
what are you afraid of August.

3253
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:51,890
The only problem with that is when we 
got scheduled.

3254
02:17:52,230 --> 02:17:53,170
That's fine.
That's fine.

3255
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:56,010
To do that though.
We can do that out and then we'll add.

3256
02:17:56,040 --> 02:17:58,230
We will come up with a and maybe this 
will be fun.

3257
02:17:58,231 --> 02:18:03,231
We'll have a very tasteful yet 
meaningful punishment for final for last

3258
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:05,730
place.
Well tasteful.

3259
02:18:05,731 --> 02:18:07,770
You just.
You're at a [inaudible] wheelhouse.

3260
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:10,080
Well,
he wants to be humiliating.

3261
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:13,230
Frozen hot dog up your asshole.
That's what he's talking about.

3262
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,830
He thought thought is too slippery and 
break out.

3263
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:21,890
We up until the end of April until the 
innovative problem.

3264
02:18:22,210 --> 02:18:23,570
I really don't have any weeks open.

3265
02:18:23,790 --> 02:18:28,790
Well,
we could certainly do something at the 

3266
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:28,790
end of April.
We could figure it out.

3267
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:28,790
Look,
yeah,

3268
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:29,910
we'll figure that part of it out.
But you're in right?

3269
02:18:29,911 --> 02:18:33,010
You're in on the bed?
Yeah.

3270
02:18:33,310 --> 02:18:35,220
Okay,
so wait,

3271
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:40,210
what's the.
The Bat,

3272
02:18:40,211 --> 02:18:45,211
his first place pays for nothing.
Second place pays for a meal.

3273
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:50,980
Third place pays for lodging and fourth 
place pays for a private jet.

3274
02:18:53,360 --> 02:18:55,030
Private jet.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3275
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:56,330
You're in,
you're in,

3276
02:18:56,400 --> 02:19:01,400
you're in what's wrong,
but that's part of what's humiliating.

3277
02:19:02,750 --> 02:19:05,390
Just don't pay so much money.
Just don't come in fourth.

3278
02:19:05,850 --> 02:19:10,850
Don't come in for it.
Enjoyed those long walks in the east 

3279
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:10,850
village.
Yeah,

3280
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:12,530
those will definitely make you win four 
years.

3281
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,790
No,
I don't want to drive it yet.

3282
02:19:14,791 --> 02:19:16,770
What are you talking about?
Shut up.

3283
02:19:17,430 --> 02:19:22,430
Really interesting to bed on.
How about a helicopter money related.

3284
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:26,760
It's cruise ship.
Winnebago across the country.

3285
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:28,550
Why it got to be money related?

3286
02:19:29,190 --> 02:19:32,610
Well,
it just doesn't do anything.

3287
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:34,740
Makes you feel terrible,
but we're all like.

3288
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:39,790
The whole thing is that we're having fun
together and it's not supposed to be 

3289
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:42,581
like really wants you to suffer.
He wants you to drink is piss and 

3290
02:19:43,290 --> 02:19:47,770
where's pubes on your face?
You got to get the names of the.

3291
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:50,170
Of the three winters tattooed on your 
left,

3292
02:19:50,171 --> 02:19:53,590
on your right hand,
on the inside palm of your right hand.

3293
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:58,190
I'm not into that.
Yeah,

3294
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:02,030
but I do like the belt.
I do like the fact that it's great.

3295
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:02,800
We have to defend them.

3296
02:20:02,820 --> 02:20:03,600
Bell,
Michael Bell,

3297
02:20:03,601 --> 02:20:05,760
Jr.
Srovio a moving trophy every year.

3298
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:08,770
KirSten,
who has the belt,

3299
02:20:08,771 --> 02:20:13,771
whoever wins,
they get to keep it in their house and 

3300
02:20:13,771 --> 02:20:14,730
make videos.
It's very motivated.

3301
02:20:14,770 --> 02:20:19,770
Any idea,
all the social media or this social 

3302
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:20,950
media points,
you can get stand in front of that belt,

3303
02:20:21,460 --> 02:20:26,460
letting everybody know and tom will 
finally have a belt of fits him.

3304
02:20:27,070 --> 02:20:27,880
So keep going.

3305
02:20:32,330 --> 02:20:34,610
So this is,
this has nothing to do.

3306
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:37,590
So it's not about how many calories you 
burn,

3307
02:20:37,620 --> 02:20:40,700
it's just about these weird points that 
this thing made,

3308
02:20:40,740 --> 02:20:43,290
which is basically related to effort.
It's like effort points.

3309
02:20:43,291 --> 02:20:44,790
Yeah,
it's a good.

3310
02:20:44,791 --> 02:20:45,750
It's a good system.

3311
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:46,550
Yeah,

3312
02:20:47,890 --> 02:20:49,100
you're incorrect.
Are you,

3313
02:20:49,290 --> 02:20:50,080
by the way,
by the way?

3314
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:55,160
I don't,
I don't have any interest in going out 

3315
02:20:55,160 --> 02:20:55,790
to vegas to go to la to get a private 
jet to then go to vegas with you guys.

3316
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:57,720
Okay.
What do you want to do?

3317
02:20:57,990 --> 02:20:58,920
What do you think it should be?

3318
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:05,120
Uh,
some sort of humiliating thing or the 

3319
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:07,121
rest of it.
But liKe I would probably meet you guys 

3320
02:21:07,121 --> 02:21:07,360
in vegas.
Wouldn't go to la then go to vega.

3321
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:10,520
Tommy bonds has to leave.
We'll we'll sort this out,

3322
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:13,550
but for sure there'll be a belt involved
for sure.

3323
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:16,820
Begging,
begging for money on three,

3324
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:18,880
not monica.
Yeah.

3325
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:21,280
Yeah.
It's boring to us already.

3326
02:21:21,290 --> 02:21:24,350
How about this?
Can you agree on this tiered structure?

3327
02:21:24,770 --> 02:21:28,130
If we find an event that you are 
comfortable and really excited about?

3328
02:21:30,970 --> 02:21:32,230
Yeah,
I'll do an event to go to.

3329
02:21:32,231 --> 02:21:33,610
It doesn't have to be.
I mean,

3330
02:21:33,611 --> 02:21:35,890
I think you have seen will be fun.
I've never seen the ufc fight,

3331
02:21:36,190 --> 02:21:40,700
but a tiered tiered structure of of 
punishment.

3332
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:44,540
Meaning for the bottom three,
a humiliation for number four.

3333
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:46,370
Belt for the winter.
Single day.

3334
02:21:46,371 --> 02:21:48,680
By the way,
single day a calorie burn and the person

3335
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:53,681
with the most points for one single day.
That person gets a brand new suit that 

3336
02:21:53,681 --> 02:21:53,681
all people have to pay for it.

3337
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:56,190
what suit?
Yeah.

3338
02:21:57,790 --> 02:21:58,700
From Hong Kong to make it?

3339
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:04,020
No,
we're going to get david august to do 

3340
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:05,611
it.
Only the guy who makes suits for conor 

3341
02:22:05,611 --> 02:22:05,980
mcgregor and me.

3342
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:08,340
Yeah.
Okay.

3343
02:22:08,350 --> 02:22:11,390
That made sense from outside tom.
Really?

3344
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:17,790
So we only make smalls.
Did he really just joking.

3345
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:20,570
He's going to rap like 70 years.
No,

3346
02:22:21,010 --> 02:22:26,010
I don't think trump will get make seats 
for putin.

3347
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:30,540
Maybe we'll know kim jones guy by the 
end of this.

3348
02:22:31,590 --> 02:22:33,360
Yeah,
like a soon we can make for this event,

3349
02:22:33,361 --> 02:22:35,380
but honestly it's just to only forgive 
me,

3350
02:22:36,010 --> 02:22:38,700
but you kind of go on this until 
probably may.

3351
02:22:40,370 --> 02:22:41,240
Yeah,
but that'd be.

3352
02:22:41,241 --> 02:22:42,770
That'd be fine because we'll have a 
belt.

3353
02:22:42,970 --> 02:22:44,540
Yeah,
the winter.

3354
02:22:44,650 --> 02:22:49,650
Get to parade around birds.
Birds already got the belt sitting on a 

3355
02:22:50,271 --> 02:22:55,271
shelf.
He's planning his little instagram 

3356
02:22:55,271 --> 02:22:56,690
stories in front of the belt.
I can't wait

3357
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,230
for sure.
Losing us.

3358
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:04,140
Listen man,
you got a lot of resolve.

3359
02:23:04,141 --> 02:23:06,810
I saw how you manned up for the fucking 
yoga challenge.

3360
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:08,400
You might man up.
By the way.

3361
02:23:08,401 --> 02:23:12,090
I'm doing the yoga challenge too.
I'm doing both things.

3362
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:14,130
You burst up doing yoga?

3363
02:23:14,430 --> 02:23:15,230
Yeah,
yeah,

3364
02:23:15,231 --> 02:23:20,231
for sure.
I'm going to do 15 hot yoga classes as 

3365
02:23:20,231 --> 02:23:20,231
well.

3366
02:23:20,231 --> 02:23:20,231
Wow.

3367
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:21,940
I'm going hard.
I'm trying to cut bert.

3368
02:23:22,780 --> 02:23:24,150
I'm going hard.
I'm trying to match job.

3369
02:23:26,610 --> 02:23:27,210
Five years.

3370
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:28,820
Yeah.
The last time you worked at was probably

3371
02:23:28,821 --> 02:23:30,080
when we did jujitsu together.

3372
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:32,000
Yeah,
probably I'd say 10,

3373
02:23:32,010 --> 02:23:32,730
10,
12 years.

3374
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:36,970
I want to be like a day that hotel gym 
for like 30 minutes.

3375
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:37,930
One.
FIve years ago.

3376
02:23:38,030 --> 02:23:38,550
I burn.

3377
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:42,250
I want joe to recognize the mickey 
mantle gene.

3378
02:23:42,340 --> 02:23:43,990
That's bullshit.
Listen,

3379
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:48,000
burst apart.
The marathon.

3380
02:23:48,001 --> 02:23:48,870
You should have already recognized.

3381
02:23:48,990 --> 02:23:50,190
Yeah,
I recognize that.

3382
02:23:51,870 --> 02:23:53,760
I want them to fall apart.
Trying to keep up though.

3383
02:23:55,220 --> 02:23:56,440
Has mickey mantle doing now?

3384
02:23:56,640 --> 02:23:57,780
He's not good.
He's not good.

3385
02:23:57,781 --> 02:23:59,250
He's not.
I just did all my measurements.

3386
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:01,980
My priest sober october at measurements.
Not good already.

3387
02:24:02,010 --> 02:24:04,380
What do you weigh right now?
Mickey mantle.

3388
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:05,700
He's dead.
That guy's dead.

3389
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:08,040
Two 46.
40 eight.

3390
02:24:08,370 --> 02:24:11,850
Belly 44.
Waste 40 or belly?

3391
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:12,870
No.
Belly 48.

3392
02:24:12,871 --> 02:24:15,750
Waste 44.
And then cabs and biceps or 16?

3393
02:24:15,751 --> 02:24:20,751

What were you at the end of the weight 

3394
02:24:20,751 --> 02:24:20,751
loss challenge?
Uh,

3395
02:24:20,751 --> 02:24:22,200
to 20 to 22 maybe.
Wow.

3396
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:23,690
I was 2:16
at the end of october.

3397
02:24:23,700 --> 02:24:25,410
October last year.
Wow.

3398
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:26,310
Yeah.
I'm going back.

3399
02:24:26,311 --> 02:24:27,580
I'm getting back.
I'm getting back to you.

3400
02:24:27,620 --> 02:24:29,010
I'm telling you right now.
I have motivation.

3401
02:24:29,230 --> 02:24:30,150
I'm what?
That belt.

3402
02:24:30,360 --> 02:24:35,360
I want that belt and I don't.
I'm not gonnA pay for anything I want 

3403
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:35,360
and I'm.
I want to see the look on your face when

3404
02:24:35,360 --> 02:24:40,191
you're like,
when you look at some of my numbers and 

3405
02:24:40,191 --> 02:24:40,191
you're like,
what the fuck is he doing?

3406
02:24:40,191 --> 02:24:40,191
He,
he's,

3407
02:24:40,191 --> 02:24:40,980
he's cheating.
He's cheating.

3408
02:24:40,981 --> 02:24:45,440
He's putting it on his dog.
Good luck with that in mind.

3409
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:47,070
This is my wheelhouse,
motherfucker.

3410
02:24:48,060 --> 02:24:50,930
My wheelhouse.
I'm excited.

3411
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:54,000
I'm excited.
I'm so excited.

3412
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:55,650
This is not my wheelhouse.
Oh,

3413
02:24:55,660 --> 02:25:00,210
I'm so excited.
Do they can get $500 a day?

3414
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:03,450
I want to see if I can hit $500 a day.
Every day.

3415
02:25:05,720 --> 02:25:08,420
I'm just going to do different things 
every day and I'm going to power.

3416
02:25:08,421 --> 02:25:10,640
Fuck.
I'm going to wear it like fuck.

3417
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,900
I'm going to be.
This is the tortoise and the hare.

3418
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:18,350
I'm just going to try the tortoise my 
way through this month.

3419
02:25:18,490 --> 02:25:18,800
Yeah.

3420
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:23,990
One hundred minutes at at a hundred 
percent of maximum heart rate is 400 

3421
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:23,990
points,

3422
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:26,530
right?
Is that what it is?

3423
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:29,170
Okay.
Is that a word for a minute?

3424
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:31,150
I don't know,
but I shit pegged.

3425
02:25:31,390 --> 02:25:36,390
I was at 97 percent for a half an hour.
I'm going to get none of that.

3426
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:40,450
You are.
Just do it.

3427
02:25:41,550 --> 02:25:46,550
Try.
I'll this guy go fucking crazy.

3428
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:47,540
Sorry.

3429
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:50,410
Tiered punishment.
one event we all can agree on.

3430
02:25:50,860 --> 02:25:52,210
Correct.
Every single day,

3431
02:25:52,211 --> 02:25:57,211
most points suit and we can add 
humiliation per like meaning like if we 

3432
02:25:58,031 --> 02:26:00,460
come up with something during the month 
that we all think is hilarious,

3433
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:05,670
texted to each other,
we put it out on social media and we 

3434
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,670
hold ourselves to that too.

3435
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:09,920
I don't think it's gonna.
Be epic from actor to do this and then 

3436
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:12,110
have nine months later because there'll 
be a belt.

3437
02:26:12,350 --> 02:26:14,360
If burt winds will never hear the end of
it.

3438
02:26:14,610 --> 02:26:18,230
The belt will be on the shelf in front 
of every fucking instagram video.

3439
02:26:18,231 --> 02:26:21,330
He makes like,
hey,

3440
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:24,650
you guys might know me.
I'm burnt crusher still october champion

3441
02:26:24,710 --> 02:26:27,290
or left.
I like to call it sober october.

3442
02:26:32,060 --> 02:26:37,060
That's going to be his mo.
My motivation is all murder and death 

3443
02:26:37,060 --> 02:26:39,620
and his motivation is all just going to 
be like instagram stories.

3444
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:42,560
Why are you scared of begging for money?

3445
02:26:42,910 --> 02:26:45,930
I'm not.
I'd be amazing at that already is.

3446
02:26:45,950 --> 02:26:47,770
I remember I barked at the boston comedy
club.

3447
02:26:47,771 --> 02:26:52,771
That's my.
That's my wheel house was talking to 

3448
02:26:52,771 --> 02:26:52,771
strangers.
You know that.

3449
02:26:52,771 --> 02:26:54,500
It's true.
Why will you not do it?

3450
02:26:54,680 --> 02:26:56,300
I would do it in a heartbeat.
I would do that for a video.

3451
02:26:56,301 --> 02:26:58,430
I just do it for.
I don't care about begging for money.

3452
02:26:58,490 --> 02:27:00,410
I don't think he finds it enticing.

3453
02:27:01,320 --> 02:27:01,920
Oh,
right.

3454
02:27:01,950 --> 02:27:04,410
Yeah,
I get it.

3455
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:06,050
Okay,
well,

3456
02:27:06,070 --> 02:27:11,070
we'll figure it out.
We'll figure the tiered structure will 

3457
02:27:11,070 --> 02:27:11,590
make it to the second place.
Doesn't play as much as third place.

3458
02:27:11,591 --> 02:27:12,260
That doesn't pay as much.

3459
02:27:12,310 --> 02:27:15,020
Fortunately the way we can be joe rogan 
that.

3460
02:27:15,190 --> 02:27:16,090
Would that be possible?

3461
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:21,270
I'm definitely going to that by the way.
I just made eye contact with me and I 

3462
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:24,040
averted my eyes.
He looked at me like,

3463
02:27:24,070 --> 02:27:26,290
are you fucking serious?
I'm so excited about that.

3464
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:30,950
This joke,
I don't believe in a lap.

3465
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:36,090
Probably two of us,
maybe three to double our points.

3466
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:42,290
I might take the whole month off comedy 
on my workout day and night.

3467
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:46,740
I might just want to.
I want to see what my body can do.

3468
02:27:46,741 --> 02:27:51,270
I might just go really crazy.
See what happens.

3469
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:56,780
I got a lot of machines here too.
I'm the only one of us that has a full 

3470
02:27:56,780 --> 02:27:56,910
gym.
Yeah,

3471
02:27:58,700 --> 02:28:00,280
you can come over here anytime you like.
Fella.

3472
02:28:00,850 --> 02:28:03,350
Are you talking about you can do.
yeah,

3473
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:04,840
you could use my gym.
Fuck you.

3474
02:28:04,880 --> 02:28:08,030
I don't know how to use half those.
Misses a workout with you.

3475
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:11,050
Taking my treadmill and dropping it off 
here.

3476
02:28:11,290 --> 02:28:13,250
Fun to work workouts greater.
We can make videos.

3477
02:28:14,010 --> 02:28:14,740
All right,
let's do that.

3478
02:28:14,990 --> 02:28:17,480
Is that like a butter churner that you 
can use?

3479
02:28:18,530 --> 02:28:19,250
Butter.
Churner.

3480
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:22,460
we're going to get either way when it's 
over.

3481
02:28:22,461 --> 02:28:27,200
We're getting fucked up.
So are you going to be around at all?

3482
02:28:27,201 --> 02:28:29,630
Anytime in november,
November 5th.

3483
02:28:29,660 --> 02:28:32,980
He said fifth,
sixth,

3484
02:28:33,430 --> 02:28:35,810
fifth or sixth?
He said I think fifth worker.

3485
02:28:35,811 --> 02:28:37,340
One.
I'm the third,

3486
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,200
fourth,
fifth,

3487
02:28:38,210 --> 02:28:39,020
seventh and ninth.
But yeah,

3488
02:28:39,021 --> 02:28:41,690
whatever that was.
Which one works for everybody?

3489
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:44,240
I think we all texted.
It's either the fifth or the sixth.

3490
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:46,670
Fifth works better for tommy.
Okay.

3491
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:48,440
That's.
That works for me man.

3492
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,380
The fifth is perfect.
Fifth or the sixth?

3493
02:28:51,381 --> 02:28:52,520
Either one.
Oh no,

3494
02:28:52,521 --> 02:28:54,930
the sixth.
I've got work I got to show.

3495
02:28:54,931 --> 02:28:59,020
I have to do the six at night at 5:00.
There's a television show I got to do,

3496
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:00,920
but I can do the fifth.
I think the fifth.

3497
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:05,050
The fifth work better for dominick.
All right,

3498
02:29:05,360 --> 02:29:08,030
we'll do the fifth.
So the fifth will get fucking plowed.

3499
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:09,110
We're going to bring in a.
Uh,

3500
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:11,600
I'm going to get a keg rater.
Ooh.

3501
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:13,640
Yeah.
We'll get a kegs.

3502
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:15,770
Tito's.
Oh,

3503
02:29:15,850 --> 02:29:17,000
what do you need?
Ari for?

3504
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:22,001
The fifth will get it in advance.
You like whiskey?

3505
02:29:23,520 --> 02:29:26,270
I love whiskey.
Pappy van winkle.

3506
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:27,860
What's your favorite bourbon?
Text me.

3507
02:29:27,861 --> 02:29:30,140
Your favorite bourbon will get a fucking
caSe of it.

3508
02:29:31,850 --> 02:29:36,850
Uber drivers who can't.
Who can't do the fifth?

3509
02:29:38,970 --> 02:29:39,430
No,
tom.

3510
02:29:39,431 --> 02:29:40,340
I know tom.
Ken.

3511
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:45,470
Ken works better for everyone.
Is everybody so sober?

3512
02:29:45,471 --> 02:29:50,471
October the fifth will be the 
celebration day and then the day where 

3513
02:29:50,471 --> 02:29:50,471
a.
Hopefully.

3514
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:53,480
Yeah.
So when he flies back,

3515
02:29:53,481 --> 02:29:55,160
we'll get them fucked up as soon as he 
lands.

3516
02:29:55,360 --> 02:29:56,450
Yeah.
Okay.

3517
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:00,640
This is going to be awesome.
All right.

3518
02:30:00,641 --> 02:30:02,480
Like I waS trying to plug this and 
there's not an email.

3519
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:07,790
I'm sure they will.
I'm going to go charge mine right now 

3520
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:07,790
and then go put it in another workout.
They'll email you and me immediately and

3521
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:12,250
if you need it was they got the message 
and that was it?

3522
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,030
No.
Did you send it to the support?

3523
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:15,920
The email that I just sat in a text 
message?

3524
02:30:16,630 --> 02:30:17,840
Yeah.
That's what was on the thing.

3525
02:30:20,120 --> 02:30:20,870
They didn't say.
Well they'll,

3526
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:23,610
they'll send them to you quickly.
Um,

3527
02:30:23,630 --> 02:30:28,630
when they're going to hear about this.
First of all they're gonna hear about 

3528
02:30:28,630 --> 02:30:28,630
this and they're probably gonna email 
you quicker.

3529
02:30:29,110 --> 02:30:34,110
Um,
but if you have any ideas about the 

3530
02:30:34,110 --> 02:30:36,671
design of the belt,
feel free to chime in there too because 

3531
02:30:36,671 --> 02:30:38,630
we got an order that soon because it 
takes like three to four weeks.

3532
02:30:39,630 --> 02:30:41,050
Oh,
okay.

3533
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:42,050
Yeah,

3534
02:30:42,690 --> 02:30:47,690
I think it'd be cool to have each of our
faceS as one of the side things with 

3535
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:48,980
our,
with our thing that is hard.

3536
02:30:48,981 --> 02:30:50,160
It's like you have a joint in your 
mouth.

3537
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:55,850
I have a tito's and my face already has 
dick in his mouth and tom is a piece of 

3538
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:55,850
cake.

3539
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:01,940
We'll figure it out.
Alright.

3540
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:02,950
Alright.
We'll figure it out.

3541
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:06,350
Alright.
Love you.

3542
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,100
Nice

3543
02:31:09,670 --> 02:31:11,310
crazy car.
So fucking excited for this.

3544
02:31:11,330 --> 02:31:12,180
It's going to be fun.
Dude.

3545
02:31:12,181 --> 02:31:14,270
I need these things in my life for some 
reason I don't like.

3546
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:19,271
I'm not,
I can't motivate unless I have like a 

3547
02:31:19,271 --> 02:31:19,271
goal.
It's serious motivation.

3548
02:31:19,271 --> 02:31:19,271
You know?
What else this,

3549
02:31:19,271 --> 02:31:19,980
you know,
I was a skeptical

3550
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:24,980
when I first thought about this,
but then in using the app while you're 

3551
02:31:24,980 --> 02:31:28,611
using the app,
it's showing you your actual numbers 

3552
02:31:28,611 --> 02:31:29,010
while you're doing it and when you're,
when you're,

3553
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,520
when you're in the middle of it,
like you're seeing the actual numbers 

3554
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:34,520
take place.
Really?

3555
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:35,040
Yeah.
My friend request.

3556
02:31:35,460 --> 02:31:38,130
I didn't know if I got it.
I know novick notifications on.

3557
02:31:38,270 --> 02:31:40,030
I just questioned you and tom.
Okay.

3558
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:40,780
I'll,
I'll go.

3559
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:43,360
What should we accept?
Other people should know?

3560
02:31:43,390 --> 02:31:48,390
Just the three of us.
Four of us want to live your life like 

3561
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:48,390
that.
I don't.

3562
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:51,370
I thought it kind of is going to be fun.
It's going to be really going to be a 

3563
02:31:52,961 --> 02:31:54,670
good one.
I wonder how much weight we are going to

3564
02:31:54,671 --> 02:31:55,000
lose.

3565
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:58,020
I'm like one 97 [inaudible] 98 right 
now.

3566
02:31:58,021 --> 02:31:59,820
I think I'm going to get down below one 
90,

3567
02:31:59,890 --> 02:32:04,890
do body measurements because I think 
that's like I did chest across the 

3568
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:05,170
nipples,
belly across the belly button,

3569
02:32:05,260 --> 02:32:08,470
waste and then biceps,
calves and thighs.

3570
02:32:09,250 --> 02:32:10,930
I'll tell you all my exact measurements 
right now.

3571
02:32:10,931 --> 02:32:12,520
I think.
I just think it was accurate.

3572
02:32:12,521 --> 02:32:16,510
My blood pressure today was my doctor 
calling about my blood pressure today to

3573
02:32:16,511 --> 02:32:19,840
figure out jesus will know because when 
I do sober october go so low.

3574
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:21,650
Is that bad?
No,

3575
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:22,810
it's good,
but I'm on medication.

3576
02:32:22,811 --> 02:32:25,570
He wants to kind of watch my medication 
so that if I.

3577
02:32:25,650 --> 02:32:29,650
What do you want?
Losartan and a or some another thing.

3578
02:32:29,770 --> 02:32:33,380
Jesus on that shit because I have high 
blood pressure.

3579
02:32:33,820 --> 02:32:35,740
one 2,995.
Was it today,

3580
02:32:35,990 --> 02:32:37,850
but is that a natural thing that you 
have?

3581
02:32:37,851 --> 02:32:39,260
High blood pressure is because of 
drinking.

3582
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I think it's probably lifestyle induced 
and things from being overweight and 

3583
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,610
probably from drinking but some bad 
thing yet.

3584
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:49,020
But they got you on pills?
Yeah,

3585
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:50,560
but I not good.
You have.

3586
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:55,600
It's better than a stroke.
Like I think me being proactive and 

3587
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:59,311
getting encino cardiologist these past 
five years has been the best thing that 

3588
02:32:59,311 --> 02:33:03,871
ever happened to me because there are 
significant side effects to a lot of 

3589
02:33:03,871 --> 02:33:04,150
those things.
Really?

3590
02:33:04,210 --> 02:33:05,770
Yeah.
You gotta look into that stuff.

3591
02:33:05,771 --> 02:33:07,190
I'd like to get off the pills all 
together.

3592
02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:09,880
I'd like to get down.
I would like to.

3593
02:33:09,881 --> 02:33:12,610
I mean we talked about it jokingly,
but I'd like to get below two.

3594
02:33:12,611 --> 02:33:14,320
Oh five.
You can do that and keep it there.

3595
02:33:14,450 --> 02:33:19,450
Listen man.
When you got to to 20 or you get two to 

3596
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:19,450
16.
You said that she ended sober october.

3597
02:33:19,450 --> 02:33:24,430
Why?
What's to stop you from losing 11 more 

3598
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:24,430
pounds.
You can do that.

3599
02:33:24,620 --> 02:33:27,410
You think about what fighters do.
How about my friend cam hanes,

3600
02:33:27,411 --> 02:33:30,230
when he was getting down to run 240 
miles,

3601
02:33:30,290 --> 02:33:33,860
he wanted to get down to 169 or below.
So you know what he did?

3602
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:36,980
He ate 2000 calories,
burned off three.

3603
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:42,580
Just kept doing it every day.
Send 10 people say they can't lose 

3604
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:42,580
weight.
I go,

3605
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:42,580
oh,
you can.

3606
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:47,410
You just got to be willing to do with 
the people that actually lose weight 

3607
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:47,410
too.

3608
02:33:47,410 --> 02:33:48,270
If you're hungry all the time,
losing weight,

3609
02:33:48,271 --> 02:33:49,480
it's hard.
[inaudible],

3610
02:33:50,930 --> 02:33:55,930
I don't have what?
How I lose weight is not the healthy 

3611
02:33:55,930 --> 02:33:55,930
way.
You crash.

3612
02:33:55,930 --> 02:33:56,790
I go,
fuck it.

3613
02:33:56,791 --> 02:33:58,380
Let's drop calories below a thousand.

3614
02:33:58,510 --> 02:33:59,470
RIght?
Bro.

3615
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:04,660
Can't do that because we actually 
discussed this on a podcast very 

3616
02:34:04,660 --> 02:34:08,281
recently.
The problem is your metabolism crashes 

3617
02:34:08,281 --> 02:34:10,741
as well and your body goes into this 
famine mode and he wants to protect 

3618
02:34:10,741 --> 02:34:10,900
calories,
so anything you do eat,

3619
02:34:10,901 --> 02:34:14,830
you gain back much quicker and then it's
far more difficult for you to lose again

3620
02:34:14,831 --> 02:34:19,831
because your body has a mechanism in 
place to protect because your body 

3621
02:34:19,831 --> 02:34:19,831
thinks it's,
you know,

3622
02:34:19,831 --> 02:34:22,720
we have to hold onto these calories.
It slows You down.

3623
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:25,420
You're,
we're talking like one of the guys,

3624
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:27,000
layne norton who's a,
uh,

3625
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:31,600
he was involved in bodybuilding and he 
was saying that his blinking was slower.

3626
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:35,320
He was blinking slower because it's 
shredding.

3627
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:38,280
Getting down to like low body weight.
Yeah.

3628
02:34:38,790 --> 02:34:43,790
His metabolism crashed so hard that he 
was literally blinking and thinking 

3629
02:34:43,790 --> 02:34:45,580
slower and thinking is for you.
For comics,

3630
02:34:45,670 --> 02:34:50,670
terrible to be thinking slower when 
you're on stage as the last thing you 

3631
02:34:50,670 --> 02:34:50,670
want,
you know,

3632
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:54,220
if you just work out like a fucking 
maniac and eat healthy,

3633
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:59,310
just cut out the sugar and the fat and 
all the bullshit your body will slim 

3634
02:34:59,310 --> 02:34:59,310
down was just going to go clean.

3635
02:34:59,310 --> 02:35:02,470
I heard of,
I had a nutritionist talk me through how

3636
02:35:02,471 --> 02:35:03,990
they eat,
what they say.

3637
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:05,230
Uh,
well the thing that.

3638
02:35:05,290 --> 02:35:06,780
Here's the thing I always had a problem 
with.

3639
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:08,290
She was like,
you need to eat before you work out.

3640
02:35:08,291 --> 02:35:13,291
You need a little bit about meal,
but you need some energy for your 

3641
02:35:13,291 --> 02:35:16,471
workout.
You don't necessarily have fast cardio 

3642
02:35:16,471 --> 02:35:16,471
all the time.
I thought,

3643
02:35:16,471 --> 02:35:17,230
well that's what I've been doing the 16 
hour fast.

3644
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:22,260
She might be old school,
but if there's a lot of people that are 

3645
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:24,460
nutrition and the science behind 
athletic performance has changed so much

3646
02:35:24,730 --> 02:35:26,260
over the last five,
10 Years.

3647
02:35:26,830 --> 02:35:27,760
This not,
you know,

3648
02:35:27,910 --> 02:35:31,570
just talking to some random nutritionist
might not be the best person to talk to.

3649
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:33,280
They might not be.
I don't,

3650
02:35:33,281 --> 02:35:34,810
I don't want to say because I don't know
her,

3651
02:35:35,080 --> 02:35:36,460
but she might not be on the ball.

3652
02:35:36,610 --> 02:35:37,050
She,
I,

3653
02:35:37,051 --> 02:35:39,550
I just,
I feel like I had so much information.

3654
02:35:39,551 --> 02:35:41,350
Especially when you listen to this 
podcast,

3655
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:43,720
you get so much information.
Zach bitters,

3656
02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:48,721
like you got to go fatty meats and then 
and then and then you hear Jordan 

3657
02:35:48,721 --> 02:35:51,700
peterson's daughter saying that all 
these people and then you go,

3658
02:35:51,800 --> 02:35:53,560
oh no,
very specific situation.

3659
02:35:53,561 --> 02:35:56,570
She hAs severe autoimmune immune issues,
severe.

3660
02:35:57,400 --> 02:36:02,400
She's most likely,
according to other nutritionist that 

3661
02:36:02,400 --> 02:36:05,401
I've talked to,
she's probably got some gut bacteria 

3662
02:36:05,401 --> 02:36:06,670
issue that she needs to get her gut 
biome sorted out.

3663
02:36:07,650 --> 02:36:10,450
It's all so above my pay grade,
quite honestly.

3664
02:36:10,451 --> 02:36:14,050
I mean I get interested in this stuff 
and I talk about and there's some things

3665
02:36:14,051 --> 02:36:15,670
that I could say with certain amount of 
certainty,

3666
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:19,870
but not really what you should and 
shouldn't do in terms of each individual

3667
02:36:19,871 --> 02:36:22,870
person in their diet.
I would say if I was you,

3668
02:36:23,050 --> 02:36:28,050
what I would get down to is I would say 
definitely start eating a lot of 

3669
02:36:28,050 --> 02:36:28,050
vegetables.

3670
02:36:28,050 --> 02:36:29,110
There's a.
That's pretty much universal.

3671
02:36:29,170 --> 02:36:31,570
Everybody agrees except these crazy 
carnivore people,

3672
02:36:31,571 --> 02:36:36,571
but I think their situation is like 
either an elimination diet or a calorie 

3673
02:36:36,571 --> 02:36:40,831
restricted diet,
which is not really the best for 

3674
02:36:40,831 --> 02:36:43,321
performance,
I don't think for the kind of shit 

3675
02:36:43,321 --> 02:36:43,321
you're trying to do.
Yeah.

3676
02:36:43,321 --> 02:36:44,320
I think broccoli,
kale,

3677
02:36:44,350 --> 02:36:45,640
spinach,
all that stuff,

3678
02:36:45,650 --> 02:36:47,740
sauteed,
all that stuff's fantastic for you.

3679
02:36:47,770 --> 02:36:50,890
Then on top of that mean obviously I eat
red meat.

3680
02:36:50,950 --> 02:36:55,950
I'm a big fan of red meat.
I think you should eat just like very 

3681
02:36:55,950 --> 02:36:59,701
nutrient dense meet and I think you 
should take multivitamins just to cover 

3682
02:36:59,741 --> 02:37:01,240
all your bases.
You know,

3683
02:37:01,241 --> 02:37:06,241
there's a bunch of like really good 
green supplements that you can add to 

3684
02:37:06,241 --> 02:37:09,901
water or you know,
little packets you could take out your 

3685
02:37:09,901 --> 02:37:09,901
calories.
No.

3686
02:37:09,901 --> 02:37:10,660
So you just eat until you're full.
Yeah.

3687
02:37:11,260 --> 02:37:11,980
Really?
Yeah.

3688
02:37:12,100 --> 02:37:13,460
How many calorIes do you think you need 
a day?

3689
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:16,510
I really don't know.
If you had to guess what's elc?

3690
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:17,830
Elc is pretty lean.
Yeah.

3691
02:37:17,831 --> 02:37:21,200
It's pretty lean and you looks like 
you're eating maybe eight ounces elk.

3692
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:24,710
I probably eat a pound of that a day for
sure.

3693
02:37:25,340 --> 02:37:26,610
At least.
Yeah.

3694
02:37:26,660 --> 02:37:29,300
I mean,
I shoot when you're 400 pounds of meat.

3695
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:31,400
I have some for you if you want.
I definitely do.

3696
02:37:31,430 --> 02:37:33,360
I got a bunch of sausage,
elk sausage.

3697
02:37:33,361 --> 02:37:35,450
Just sensational.
Really love it.

3698
02:37:35,480 --> 02:37:36,890
You'll love it.
A ton of it,

3699
02:37:36,891 --> 02:37:38,060
man.
I'm definitely up for that.

3700
02:37:38,061 --> 02:37:38,540
Yeah.
Okay.

3701
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:40,020
I've got a bunch in the back.
Okay.

3702
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:42,670
I got these freezer bags too.
We can take it home with um,

3703
02:37:42,990 --> 02:37:47,990
well I would say just cut out the sugar 
and the bread and the pasta and if you 

3704
02:37:48,081 --> 02:37:49,700
just do that you'll lose a ton of 
weight.

3705
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:51,620
You lose a ton of weight.
Just doing that.

3706
02:37:52,460 --> 02:37:52,770
I'm in.

3707
02:37:52,790 --> 02:37:54,470
This one's going to be fucking awesome.
Yeah man.

3708
02:37:54,471 --> 02:37:55,970
Just vegetables.
Just eat a,

3709
02:37:56,050 --> 02:38:01,050
you know,
get yourself a fucking big bowl of 

3710
02:38:01,050 --> 02:38:03,410
broccolini and cook it with butter and 
olive oil and put garlic salt on it.

3711
02:38:03,890 --> 02:38:06,290
It's healthy.
It feels good when you eat it,

3712
02:38:06,291 --> 02:38:08,710
your body responds weLl to it.
You know,

3713
02:38:09,650 --> 02:38:14,650
just only good nutrients meant and just 
realize you're going to have to get a 

3714
02:38:14,650 --> 02:38:16,370
lot of rest and you're going out to 
drink a shit ton of water because you're

3715
02:38:16,371 --> 02:38:21,371
going to be keeping up with some 
terrifying numbers were going hard this 

3716
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:26,450
month per days,
man.

3717
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:29,620
Thirty one days.
Yeah,

3718
02:38:29,720 --> 02:38:30,560
the end.
Ben.

3719
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:35,760
Oof.
I'm going to fucking look a megan jack 

3720
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:35,760
shredded.
You're going to be like skinny bert like

3721
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:38,680
from that photo and maybe maybe I'll do 
trt to,

3722
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:41,180
to view when do you know how you should 
do trt?

3723
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:43,070
Would you ever get your hormones tested 
but tested?

3724
02:38:43,160 --> 02:38:45,260
Should get them tested,
is to find out where you're at.

3725
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:48,050
It'll help everything.
Helps your immune system.

3726
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:50,930
Helps your energy levels really helps 
your concentration.

3727
02:38:50,931 --> 02:38:52,950
Yeah.
It's literally enhancing place.

3728
02:38:52,970 --> 02:38:54,680
You can get t dot.
Well you don't.

3729
02:38:54,930 --> 02:38:56,690
You got to do it.
Look at that picture.

3730
02:38:57,090 --> 02:38:58,220
Yeah,
that's my 40th birthday,

3731
02:38:58,910 --> 02:39:01,490
my 40th birthday.
Slender face.

3732
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:06,730
See right there.
You are like five pounds from being 

3733
02:39:06,730 --> 02:39:09,251
shredded.
If you have right there and you lost 

3734
02:39:09,251 --> 02:39:12,041
five pounds,
you'd have a six pack that I did the 

3735
02:39:12,041 --> 02:39:12,410
cus.
I lost that weight in 19 days.

3736
02:39:12,860 --> 02:39:14,330
Wow.
See,

3737
02:39:14,331 --> 02:39:16,370
the problem is when you do that,
the yo yo,

3738
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:19,700
your crap.
Why is a picture of me shirtless?

3739
02:39:19,701 --> 02:39:23,810
Right under burt's picture.
That's me when I was like 26.

3740
02:39:24,560 --> 02:39:28,340
Oh my god,
it's me on newsradio 20,

3741
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:33,020
27 sexy pitch.
Um,

3742
02:39:34,530 --> 02:39:36,080
what?
So yeah,

3743
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:38,050
the problem is losing the,
losing the weight,

3744
02:39:38,051 --> 02:39:39,170
like a crash.

3745
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:44,560
The problem with the crash is see if you
lose the weight over the month because 

3746
02:39:44,601 --> 02:39:46,780
you're just burning it off like a 
madman,

3747
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:51,790
but you're eating a lot.
Your body's not going to be in famine 

3748
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:51,790
mode.
Your body is going to be more efficient.

3749
02:39:51,790 --> 02:39:54,050
It's going to need more cows and you 
definitely should lift weights.

3750
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:55,670
That's one thing you should do over 
this.

3751
02:39:55,820 --> 02:39:57,860
And lifting weights will also add to 
this I,

3752
02:39:57,910 --> 02:40:00,590
my,
my plan is lifting weights,

3753
02:40:00,680 --> 02:40:03,050
kickboxing,
running hills,

3754
02:40:03,110 --> 02:40:08,110
yoga,
and then Various cardio machines from 

3755
02:40:08,110 --> 02:40:09,590
the versa climber to the rower,
to the echo bike.

3756
02:40:09,591 --> 02:40:14,591
I'm going to rotate them all so I can 
keep doing all of them so I can do 

3757
02:40:14,591 --> 02:40:14,591
different ones.
I got the rower

3758
02:40:14,591 --> 02:40:16,920
in my house,
I got the assault air fitness trainer.

3759
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,950
Don't deny yourself any food though.
Just fucking pound food,

3760
02:40:20,420 --> 02:40:22,440
pound food all the time because you're 
just going to be.

3761
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:25,050
YOu're going to be so hungry.
All right.

3762
02:40:25,990 --> 02:40:26,430
I think,
yeah,

3763
02:40:26,431 --> 02:40:27,110
if I.
If I do,

3764
02:40:27,380 --> 02:40:31,950
if I figured if I do two days and then 
and just go,

3765
02:40:31,951 --> 02:40:33,490
I know what I got to get a day.
Yeah.

3766
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:36,330
Yeah.
It just keep going.

3767
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:40,650
Yeah,
it's going to be great for all of us.

3768
02:40:40,800 --> 02:40:45,800
It Was.
I was thinking about that today when I 

3769
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:45,800
was a.
When I was working on,

3770
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:45,800
I was like,
wow,

3771
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:49,161
this is a very.
When you looking at the numbers on that 

3772
02:40:49,161 --> 02:40:49,161
thing,
it's very motivational.

3773
02:40:49,161 --> 02:40:50,460
You know?
It's funny,

3774
02:40:50,490 --> 02:40:53,220
when before when I was in college,
I ran and what was really fun,

3775
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:58,400
the stuff these rudders journals is to 
get done your run and write them in 

3776
02:40:58,400 --> 02:40:58,950
tracking your fitness.

3777
02:40:58,950 --> 02:41:03,950
Tracking your workout is.
It's really fun to look at numbers and 

3778
02:41:03,950 --> 02:41:05,160
stack up.
It's almost like it feels like some,

3779
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:09,150
like almost like a hoarder's vibe or 
like an ocd vibe.

3780
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:10,530
Yeah,
it's definitely better.

3781
02:41:10,531 --> 02:41:13,710
Like when it's on this app than it is if
you just know you're worked out.

3782
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:15,270
Yeah.
I used to.

3783
02:41:15,271 --> 02:41:17,400
When I used to,
when fitbit first came out,

3784
02:41:17,401 --> 02:41:19,620
I used to get.
I had to get to 12,000

3785
02:41:19,621 --> 02:41:22,470
steps every day and I would,
I would land from a flight,

3786
02:41:22,471 --> 02:41:27,471
get up to my hotel room,
open a bottle of wine and just start 

3787
02:41:27,471 --> 02:41:28,650
dancing.
Fucking weird as fuck.

3788
02:41:29,370 --> 02:41:31,240
Like if someone came and complained,
I,

3789
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:32,950
they would think I was on meth.
Yeah,

3790
02:41:32,960 --> 02:41:34,050
it's,
it feels good.

3791
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:37,350
It feels good to set goals I might have,
but I always tell people like one of the

3792
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:40,020
best ways to get things done is to write
things down.

3793
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:42,450
It is,
it's such a huge motivating factor.

3794
02:41:42,451 --> 02:41:45,780
Like you have a list of shit that you 
have to do today and check those bitches

3795
02:41:45,781 --> 02:41:48,660
off and then at the end of the day you 
feel good.

3796
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:50,160
Like you go to bed,
you feel good.

3797
02:41:50,161 --> 02:41:52,080
I checked off all those things on my 
list.

3798
02:41:52,081 --> 02:41:54,180
I'm better now.
I feel better than I was before.

3799
02:41:54,270 --> 02:41:56,490
Yeah.
My wife's a big list maker.

3800
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,020
Huge.
When you make a list,

3801
02:41:58,021 --> 02:42:01,680
it really does organize your day like I 
will when I was shooting,

3802
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:06,800
shooting the promo thing for my tour 
next week and I shot at this weekend in 

3803
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:08,580
san jose and uh,
and I was like,

3804
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:11,040
I had all these different things I 
needed to do and my wife's like,

3805
02:42:11,041 --> 02:42:12,360
make a fucking list.
And I went,

3806
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:13,390
oh yeah,
yeah.

3807
02:42:13,470 --> 02:42:18,470
So I wrote down all the shots I needed 
that I'd feel like I didn't feel like I 

3808
02:42:18,470 --> 02:42:18,890
didn't get the night before and then 
just banged it out and I was like,

3809
02:42:18,891 --> 02:42:20,280
wow,
that was fucking easy as shit.

3810
02:42:20,370 --> 02:42:25,370
Yeah,
it's so much better than like trying to 

3811
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:25,370
remember what else,
what else do I need to do?

3812
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:27,810
And then like half ass in it.
You knoW what you did.

3813
02:42:27,811 --> 02:42:32,811
That's very impressive.
You came up with a new hour pretty 

3814
02:42:32,811 --> 02:42:32,940
fucking quick.
Like how long did it take you to come up

3815
02:42:32,941 --> 02:42:34,310
with a new hour?
Uh,

3816
02:42:34,311 --> 02:42:35,130
I came up with it.
I've,

3817
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:37,920
I don't know,
maybe like a february,

3818
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:39,810
march,
april,

3819
02:42:39,811 --> 02:42:40,890
may,
june,

3820
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,660
six months.
What did you do to ramp up your writing?

3821
02:42:45,750 --> 02:42:49,050
A super aware.
So my biggest thing for me,

3822
02:42:49,051 --> 02:42:50,330
which I think helped me back,
and I've,

3823
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:53,190
I've talked about this a lot,
maybe a lot,

3824
02:42:53,191 --> 02:42:57,030
but when you were in production brain,
you didn't have room for comedy brain.

3825
02:42:57,210 --> 02:43:02,210
Like when I was making a tv show I never
did another room for comedy and so I 

3826
02:43:02,210 --> 02:43:03,690
might be obsessed with football so there
might be something wrong with me,

3827
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:06,000
but when I'm in comedy brain and which 
is when I'm.

3828
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,390
When I'm doing a special,
it's focused on only that material,

3829
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:14,420
like only the material.
But when I docked on the special I just 

3830
02:43:14,420 --> 02:43:14,550
went up and was like,
here.

3831
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:16,860
It was the most enjoyable time in my 
life.

3832
02:43:16,861 --> 02:43:19,030
It's like everything was a bit just 
walking around.

3833
02:43:19,031 --> 02:43:24,031
I was looking for things and just being 
inspired by the littlest thing even to 

3834
02:43:24,031 --> 02:43:25,190
this day,
but it's part of the reason I like to go

3835
02:43:25,191 --> 02:43:27,130
over to New York and do podcasts and 
fuck around.

3836
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:32,430
I was on anthony humanist podcasts.
I came up with two bits in the moment 

3837
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:32,430
that I was like,
do those,

3838
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:36,940
those are going to new environment and 
new feeling your brain firing and done.

3839
02:43:36,941 --> 02:43:41,941
Not denying myself the opportunity of a 
bit because a bit is silly or goofy or 

3840
02:43:41,941 --> 02:43:42,790
hacky in my head.
I go,

3841
02:43:42,791 --> 02:43:44,800
that's okay,
let's keep working that.

3842
02:43:45,370 --> 02:43:46,330
And so,
um,

3843
02:43:46,331 --> 02:43:50,260
I have right now I have like 55 minutes 
that I'm,

3844
02:43:50,500 --> 02:43:55,500
that I feel is really solid,
but the goal now sort of like we were 

3845
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:57,850
talking to tom was talking about 
untangling it is like weaving it in.

3846
02:43:57,850 --> 02:44:02,850
So that one that follows the other one.
So right now I'm playing with these 

3847
02:44:02,850 --> 02:44:02,850
bits,
putting them in different places,

3848
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:05,800
trying to figure out what could follow a
bit.

3849
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:08,260
That's the funnest part also.
Right.

3850
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:10,840
And then once I do that and once I have 
no what I'm doing,

3851
02:44:10,841 --> 02:44:15,841
my next vessel,
that's what it almost becomes less fun 

3852
02:44:15,841 --> 02:44:18,751
for me.
It's like I don't want to go to the 

3853
02:44:18,751 --> 02:44:18,751
store because I don't want to write new 
bits,

3854
02:44:18,751 --> 02:44:21,220
but like in this salad days or when 
you're just all writing,

3855
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:26,460
I loved that shit.
Just going up on stage and going in la 

3856
02:44:26,460 --> 02:44:29,371
and be like,
I bought a gun and just go and just 

3857
02:44:29,371 --> 02:44:29,371
feeling the energy and being like,
oh,

3858
02:44:29,371 --> 02:44:29,371
I'm in,
I'm in it.

3859
02:44:29,371 --> 02:44:31,570
I don't know where this is going.
I could lose them.

3860
02:44:31,640 --> 02:44:32,100
Right,
right.

3861
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:33,430
So I wouldn't buy numbing,
joking.

3862
02:44:33,431 --> 02:44:37,210
I went and bought a gun because I 
thought it wouldn't be a good bit when I

3863
02:44:37,211 --> 02:44:39,490
went and said,
did you say that on stage?

3864
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,350
No,
yoU should,

3865
02:44:40,390 --> 02:44:42,340
but that should be part of the bet.
Are you serious?

3866
02:44:42,341 --> 02:44:43,480
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,

3867
02:44:43,481 --> 02:44:45,500
fucking done.
I bought a gun because they thought it'd

3868
02:44:45,501 --> 02:44:50,501
be a good bet.
I was driving out in burbank and I was 

3869
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:50,501
like,
oh,

3870
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:50,501
this gun talk.
And I was like,

3871
02:44:50,501 --> 02:44:52,270
I don't have any gun material.
Was like I should buy a gun.

3872
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:57,300
And I was like,
have a real gun nut on your podcast to 

3873
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:57,300
talk to you about guns.
I should,

3874
02:44:57,390 --> 02:45:00,640
you know,
she can't get on a colion noir either.

3875
02:45:00,641 --> 02:45:03,250
That guy follow that guy on youtube.
He was on my podcast.

3876
02:45:03,450 --> 02:45:04,620
Good guy.
Yeah,

3877
02:45:04,630 --> 02:45:05,740
he's great.
Yeah.

3878
02:45:05,810 --> 02:45:06,290
Was.
Oh yeah,

3879
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:07,570
yeah.
Fucking I'm going to.

3880
02:45:07,571 --> 02:45:12,571
I'm going to be like the progressive guy
that makes it seem like there's 

3881
02:45:12,571 --> 02:45:12,571
something wrong that you're pointing it 
out.

3882
02:45:12,571 --> 02:45:13,510
Yes.
He happens to be an african american.

3883
02:45:13,530 --> 02:45:15,070
No,
but in that culture you have to bring it

3884
02:45:15,071 --> 02:45:17,410
up in that culture that is so 
interesting that they.

3885
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:22,590
It's almost like a.
I feel like when he had a mr mike on 

3886
02:45:22,590 --> 02:45:22,990
magic.
Mike,

3887
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:25,180
not magic mike.
Killer killer mike on.

3888
02:45:25,570 --> 02:45:28,120
It was really cool to hear this through 
mike magic.

3889
02:45:28,121 --> 02:45:30,430
Mike was here,
they're white guy.

3890
02:45:30,431 --> 02:45:33,550
Mike.
It was cool to hear their perspective on

3891
02:45:33,551 --> 02:45:33,970
it,
you know,

3892
02:45:33,971 --> 02:45:35,640
Because culturally you always see a 
company,

3893
02:45:35,660 --> 02:45:38,560
the nra come from this like whIte 
redneck thing.

3894
02:45:39,580 --> 02:45:40,450
No,
he's.

3895
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:41,170
well,
you know,

3896
02:45:41,171 --> 02:45:42,820
he makes real good points.
I mean,

3897
02:45:42,821 --> 02:45:44,440
he wasn't a lawyer.
He was a lawyer.

3898
02:45:44,441 --> 02:45:46,870
Right?
I'm pretty sure it was like he was.

3899
02:45:46,871 --> 02:45:49,330
Yeah.
But he makes really good points in terms

3900
02:45:49,331 --> 02:45:51,790
of like a personal safety and 
responsibility.

3901
02:45:52,120 --> 02:45:57,120
The thing about like,
people equate nra with mass shootings 

3902
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,480
and all kinds of other crazy shit,
which is not really totally fair because

3903
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:00,970
no nra member has ever committed a mass 
shooting.

3904
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:02,830
you know,
whenever something happens,

3905
02:46:02,831 --> 02:46:03,460
they think,
oh,

3906
02:46:03,461 --> 02:46:08,461
this is all because these people want 
the other people that have access to 

3907
02:46:08,461 --> 02:46:08,740
these kinds of guns.

3908
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,220
The real connection,
as always an ad nauseum.

3909
02:46:13,221 --> 02:46:16,010
I've talked about this too much,
is psychotropic drugs.

3910
02:46:16,011 --> 02:46:18,710
Those people are almost all on some sort
of psych medicine.

3911
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:19,530
All of them.
Yeah.

3912
02:46:19,830 --> 02:46:22,970
The is a ca.
Is it causation or correlation?

3913
02:46:22,971 --> 02:46:27,971
That's the problem.
Is the psychotropic drugs cause causing 

3914
02:46:27,971 --> 02:46:30,020
them to do this or are they on 
psychotropic drugs because they're crazy

3915
02:46:30,021 --> 02:46:33,110
and they shouldn't haVe a gun anyway and
it should be more difficult.

3916
02:46:33,111 --> 02:46:38,111
I'm I'm 100 percent.
I'm in believed that you should test 

3917
02:46:38,111 --> 02:46:42,161
people and that there should be some 
sort of standards in terms of mental 

3918
02:46:42,161 --> 02:46:44,490
health in terms of Whether or not you've
committed assault,

3919
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:45,890
whether or not like those kinds of 
things,

3920
02:46:46,250 --> 02:46:48,380
whether or not you have a history of 
mental illness,

3921
02:46:48,381 --> 02:46:51,500
whether or not you have a history of 
lashing out or violent outbursts.

3922
02:46:51,501 --> 02:46:53,180
Yeah.
Those kind of people shouldn't have guns

3923
02:46:53,390 --> 02:46:55,880
that the kind of people that think 
everybody shouLd have access to a gun,

3924
02:46:55,881 --> 02:46:59,780
I think that's a little irresponsible,
but the kind of people that think no one

3925
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:04,900
should have a gun,
I think that's irresponsible to scratch 

3926
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:04,900
crazy talk.
I mean,

3927
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:05,790
it's not going to happen in our country.
No,

3928
02:47:05,791 --> 02:47:07,250
not in this one.
No,

3929
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:10,760
but you should haVe him on men or or 
there's other gun nuts.

3930
02:47:10,790 --> 02:47:13,390
I could turn you onto my friend.
Justin's legit gun nut.

3931
02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:17,000
Just met him just in college.
He's been on my podcast for.

3932
02:47:17,210 --> 02:47:19,520
He's a legiT giant.
He's like seven feet tall,

3933
02:47:19,850 --> 02:47:22,130
but he's a real gun nut.
He's.

3934
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:24,040
He lives in vegas.
He has so many guns.

3935
02:47:24,050 --> 02:47:25,070
Doesn't know how many guns.
Yes.

3936
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:26,520
Well,
no,

3937
02:47:26,521 --> 02:47:26,870
no.
Stay.

3938
02:47:26,920 --> 02:47:27,860
I'm thinking of the.
The,

3939
02:47:28,010 --> 02:47:29,980
the fighter.
Frank mir is a big gun guy.

3940
02:47:30,420 --> 02:47:33,780
Giant gun guy.
Frank mir strapped everywhere.

3941
02:47:33,781 --> 02:47:35,640
He goes.
He's got like one in his ankle.

3942
02:47:35,641 --> 02:47:36,540
One up his ass.

3943
02:47:36,820 --> 02:47:38,710
Frank,
here's a really interesting guy.

3944
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:40,440
Smart dude.
He did my this.

3945
02:47:40,540 --> 02:47:43,920
There's something about cage fighters 
were there.

3946
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:47,770
Is there,
is there a very direct and they say what

3947
02:47:47,771 --> 02:47:52,771
they mean and they mean what they say.
Tate was the first person that I ever 

3948
02:47:52,771 --> 02:47:56,160
ran into that was like that.
He texted me and I didn't text back and 

3949
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,240
he texted again and then he texted,
hey man,

3950
02:47:58,270 --> 02:48:00,670
I'm starting to get feelings about this.
Text me back.

3951
02:48:01,230 --> 02:48:02,350
And then I was like,
well yeah,

3952
02:48:02,410 --> 02:48:07,410
frank meir said he came to my podcast,
we had a cigar while we're doing the 

3953
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:10,261
podcast and he's just like,
I'm such and maybe I'm such in this 

3954
02:48:10,261 --> 02:48:11,710
weird bullshit hollywood world where 
people don't mean what they say that I,

3955
02:48:11,770 --> 02:48:13,870
I'm used to that.
And he goes,

3956
02:48:13,871 --> 02:48:15,280
uh,
that was a really great cigar.

3957
02:48:15,370 --> 02:48:16,960
We should do this.
We should have another one.

3958
02:48:17,370 --> 02:48:17,920
I Was like,
okay.

3959
02:48:17,921 --> 02:48:18,340
And he's like,
well,

3960
02:48:18,341 --> 02:48:19,600
what are you doing it like eight 
tonight?

3961
02:48:20,080 --> 02:48:21,640
And I was like,
I'm here.

3962
02:48:21,641 --> 02:48:26,641
And he was like,
I'm going to do a podcast so I have 

3963
02:48:26,641 --> 02:48:26,641
another cigar.
I was like,

3964
02:48:26,641 --> 02:48:29,050
okay.
I sure I didn't think I'd ever seen him 

3965
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:29,050
again.
He showed back up at 7:55.

3966
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:29,050
He was like,
you ready for that car?

3967
02:48:29,050 --> 02:48:30,670
And we went in my back yard.
We spoke to another cigar,

3968
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:32,500
just talked.
It was like he fucked.

3969
02:48:32,550 --> 02:48:33,330
okay.
It's fine.

3970
02:48:33,331 --> 02:48:36,060
It's being sincere as an oddity.
Yeah.

3971
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:40,020
This is the world of acting.
That's what it is.

3972
02:48:40,170 --> 02:48:45,170
You around this world of auditions and 
actors and producers and exactly this 

3973
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:48,210
strange land we live in,
man,

3974
02:48:49,090 --> 02:48:51,870
this right here.
This shit happens in other places,

3975
02:48:51,871 --> 02:48:56,871
but it just is very prevalent here.
Like where people just aren't genuine 

3976
02:48:56,871 --> 02:48:58,030
and they're not honest.
You put this like

3977
02:48:58,090 --> 02:49:03,090
people just lick their finger and stick 
it out in the wind trying to figure out 

3978
02:49:03,090 --> 02:49:03,930
which way the wind's blowing and that's 
the way they go.

3979
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:06,960
Like because everybody just wants 
everybody to like them out here.

3980
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:10,440
Everyone's auditioning for things.
It's just such a strange place,

3981
02:49:10,441 --> 02:49:10,770
man.

3982
02:49:11,470 --> 02:49:15,910
I saw my buddy eddie is a like a man,
you know the cuban from Florida.

3983
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:18,390
Bill fist fight his fucking chair.
You know,

3984
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:20,400
just a regular guy.
That means maxwell.

3985
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:23,140
Man.
He came out the first time he came out,

3986
02:49:23,170 --> 02:49:24,700
there was a comic,
I won't say his name,

3987
02:49:24,970 --> 02:49:29,970
who was holding court at the hollywood 
improv and he was making fun of me like 

3988
02:49:29,970 --> 02:49:31,990
as the joke,
everyone was laughing and I was laughing

3989
02:49:32,920 --> 02:49:37,920
and my buddy eddie just kind of looked 
sideways and we got in the car and he 

3990
02:49:37,920 --> 02:49:37,920
goes,
why why'd you let that happen?

3991
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:38,760
I go,
he's,

3992
02:49:38,870 --> 02:49:40,150
he's super famous.
I mean,

3993
02:49:40,151 --> 02:49:41,260
you know,
it's like whatever.

3994
02:49:41,890 --> 02:49:43,480
He was not man,
now he's,

3995
02:49:43,520 --> 02:49:48,520
he's smaller than you.
Why don't you just fucking knock them 

3996
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:48,520
out?
And I go,

3997
02:49:48,520 --> 02:49:48,640
that's not how it works out here.
He goes,

3998
02:49:48,641 --> 02:49:49,030
yeah,
it is.

3999
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:51,250
It is.
It does let them say that shit to me.

4000
02:49:51,380 --> 02:49:52,970
That's how it works.
I go,

4001
02:49:53,010 --> 02:49:54,050
no,
I understand.

4002
02:49:54,520 --> 02:49:59,520
Yeah.
I was just knocking about and he was 

4003
02:49:59,520 --> 02:49:59,520
like,
dude,

4004
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:00,010
I don't like that disrespectful shit.
I was like,

4005
02:50:00,011 --> 02:50:01,190
well,
it's different out here at.

4006
02:50:01,191 --> 02:50:01,600
He goes,
no,

4007
02:50:01,601 --> 02:50:06,601
it's not your,
it's different cause you're letting it 

4008
02:50:06,601 --> 02:50:06,601
be different.
Well,

4009
02:50:06,601 --> 02:50:08,020
it depends on how close you are with the
guy because if you're really good

4010
02:50:08,140 --> 02:50:13,140
close with the guy and he's saying funny
things and you think they're funny and 

4011
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:16,150
you laughing sincerely,
like we bust on each other all the time.

4012
02:50:16,170 --> 02:50:18,100
Yeah.
But it's not disrespectful.

4013
02:50:18,101 --> 02:50:19,510
It's just hilarious.
It's just,

4014
02:50:19,511 --> 02:50:24,511
I think it's,
I think everyone knows that we're all 

4015
02:50:24,511 --> 02:50:24,550
close friends and that's our,
it's our language.

4016
02:50:24,551 --> 02:50:27,880
But there are people who are not your 
close friends who was like,

4017
02:50:27,881 --> 02:50:29,350
you look at bird over there with blah 
blah,

4018
02:50:29,351 --> 02:50:30,880
blah,
and then they'll start fucking with you.

4019
02:50:30,881 --> 02:50:32,920
And nick gets a little slippery and 
grow.

4020
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,050
It's a.
especially,

4021
02:50:34,051 --> 02:50:34,820
there's,
there's uh,

4022
02:50:34,821 --> 02:50:37,010
it's narcissism.
It's guys who Built it.

4023
02:50:37,090 --> 02:50:40,110
They just,
they think they'll alfia yeah.

4024
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:42,090
And it's funny.
I,

4025
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:45,120
I definitely have changed from that.
When you know,

4026
02:50:45,121 --> 02:50:48,030
when you're young and you're hungry in 
this business and you want to succeed,

4027
02:50:48,270 --> 02:50:53,270
you don't want to tell a famous guy that
might be able to give you work him and 

4028
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:53,270
don't talk to me like that because then 
you almost like blackball yourself.

4029
02:50:53,270 --> 02:50:53,830
Right?
Well,

4030
02:50:53,831 --> 02:50:57,190
you've had some bad experiences and we 
don't need to mention any names that you

4031
02:50:57,191 --> 02:51:02,191
had some bad experiences with a 
particular comedian that was like that 

4032
02:51:02,191 --> 02:51:02,191
where,
you know,

4033
02:51:02,191 --> 02:51:03,460
we've talked about it.
There's,

4034
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:07,520
there's mental mentally ill people that 
are in this business too,

4035
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:08,980
you know,
there's that.

4036
02:51:10,050 --> 02:51:11,080
It's tough.
Yeah.

4037
02:51:11,970 --> 02:51:12,720
I feel like,
uh,

4038
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:15,900
I feel like sometimes I draw them in.
It's taught to stand up.

4039
02:51:16,290 --> 02:51:17,540
Nice.
Yeah.

4040
02:51:17,541 --> 02:51:18,060
And I,
and I,

4041
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:19,010
and I'm,
I,

4042
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:20,350
I,
I'll say this about myself,

4043
02:51:20,351 --> 02:51:21,930
but I'm very creative and I like to fuck
around.

4044
02:51:21,960 --> 02:51:23,160
I like to,
you know,

4045
02:51:23,161 --> 02:51:24,930
and I think some people see that as a 
weakness.

4046
02:51:24,931 --> 02:51:25,800
I,
I'm,

4047
02:51:25,900 --> 02:51:29,520
there's someone that I'm told you 
privately that stole from me,

4048
02:51:29,730 --> 02:51:34,580
that was a friend separate and it,
I,

4049
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:39,620
man,
that fucking makes me angry because I 

4050
02:51:39,620 --> 02:51:41,631
go,
I remember when it happened and I had 

4051
02:51:41,631 --> 02:51:41,631
already dealt with something else that 
was similar to that.

4052
02:51:41,631 --> 02:51:43,290
I remember I was at my wife's lake house
when someone texted me and said,

4053
02:51:43,291 --> 02:51:46,320
hey man,
did you give that job to that person?

4054
02:51:46,380 --> 02:51:48,810
And I was like,
no man,

4055
02:51:48,811 --> 02:51:51,390
it pulled this fucking thing in my.
In my head.

4056
02:51:51,391 --> 02:51:53,190
That was like,
I remember thinking,

4057
02:51:53,191 --> 02:51:54,330
did you,
do you think I'm weak?

4058
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:56,610
Do you think I won't say anything.
Do you think?

4059
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,980
Do you think that you can do that to me?
right.

4060
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,780
And,
and I didn't say anything.

4061
02:52:00,781 --> 02:52:05,781
I didn't say anything because I learned 
the first time around that it really 

4062
02:52:05,781 --> 02:52:06,550
almost like all these that come out 
about sexual assault.

4063
02:52:06,570 --> 02:52:11,570
It doesn't,
it doesn't benefit you to coMe out and 

4064
02:52:11,570 --> 02:52:12,290
say that someone stole joke from you.
You just equate still.

4065
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:13,150
I know,
I know,

4066
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:14,680
but no,
but it's coming.

4067
02:52:14,860 --> 02:52:19,860
It's that coming forward thing where 
when you look at these women and said 

4068
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:19,860
there's no benefit and go,
people go,

4069
02:52:19,860 --> 02:52:20,710
oh bitches.
I go,

4070
02:52:20,711 --> 02:52:21,250
no,
theY don't.

4071
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:24,060
There's not a lot of benefit to go and 
say you've been raped because now you've

4072
02:52:24,061 --> 02:52:26,690
got to fucking.
That's what you're defined as and,

4073
02:52:26,700 --> 02:52:31,700
and you.
And You've got to defend yourself from 

4074
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:32,480
something you didn't do to yourself.
and so when you get stolen from them,

4075
02:52:32,770 --> 02:52:34,600
obviously that is a stretch of an 
equivalent person.

4076
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:37,540
But to come out and defend yourself,
people do start attackIng.

4077
02:52:37,541 --> 02:52:39,110
You go,
why would you even say anything to?

4078
02:52:39,130 --> 02:52:40,690
You're just,
you're just jealous.

4079
02:52:41,200 --> 02:52:46,200
Pull yourself out on a limb.
If you're talking about someone taking 

4080
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:46,200
something like a joke for me too,
because you have.

4081
02:52:46,200 --> 02:52:48,040
You have to hope that people side with 
you.

4082
02:52:48,070 --> 02:52:51,010
So like say if some famous person steal 
something from you,

4083
02:52:51,370 --> 02:52:55,870
you have to hope when you come out that,
that they're not a bunch of people going

4084
02:52:55,871 --> 02:53:00,370
to jump on his side and attacked you,
which is totally possible.

4085
02:53:00,790 --> 02:53:03,070
And if tHey do then you're fucked and 
you're out on a limb.

4086
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:04,040
Dude,
I went through,

4087
02:53:04,130 --> 02:53:06,260
I went through and I screen grabbed 
everything.

4088
02:53:06,290 --> 02:53:10,040
That was proof.
unequivocably screen grabbed everything.

4089
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:12,260
Fuck them.
Yeah,

4090
02:53:12,300 --> 02:53:13,550
I got everything.
Yeah.

4091
02:53:13,650 --> 02:53:16,160
Oh no.
said I'll never do anything with it.

4092
02:53:16,610 --> 02:53:21,610
But you know what man?
The good lesson is now that person you 

4093
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:22,460
Could write off forever.
It's like,

4094
02:53:23,030 --> 02:53:25,460
what was the goodfellas?
What was it?

4095
02:53:25,461 --> 02:53:27,320
What was the movie like?
You got off light.

4096
02:53:27,410 --> 02:53:30,980
Like now you know the for $20 or $200,
whatever it is.

4097
02:53:30,981 --> 02:53:32,600
Now that person never has talked to you 
again.

4098
02:53:32,850 --> 02:53:33,650
Yeah,
he good.

4099
02:53:34,650 --> 02:53:39,620
You know you sometimes it's sometimes 
when someone does something like that,

4100
02:53:39,621 --> 02:53:40,280
you're like,
okay,

4101
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:42,350
now I can write you off

4102
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:46,040
and in and write them off in a very 
interesting way as a comic to know,

4103
02:53:46,430 --> 02:53:47,210
oh,
you never had it.

4104
02:53:47,211 --> 02:53:49,040
You never will.
You don't got what I have.

4105
02:53:49,070 --> 02:53:51,410
I can make more of that shit.
That's what I do for a living.

4106
02:53:51,650 --> 02:53:52,090
Oh,
you,

4107
02:53:52,340 --> 02:53:57,340
oh my god.
So when you really don't have any 

4108
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:57,340
material and you don't know how to 
write,

4109
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:57,340
you don't know how to write new 
material.

4110
02:53:57,340 --> 02:53:57,980
Oh,
shut the fuck up.

4111
02:53:58,130 --> 02:53:59,820
So that's what you can't do.
Oh,

4112
02:53:59,930 --> 02:54:00,680
suck a dick.

4113
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:05,320
There's two.
There's two different types of mindsets.

4114
02:54:05,321 --> 02:54:10,321
The type of mindset where someone like 
steals someone else's ideas and tries to

4115
02:54:12,221 --> 02:54:17,221
pass them off as their own is kind of 
the opposite mindset as to someone who's

4116
02:54:18,490 --> 02:54:20,290
creative.
Because when you're creative,

4117
02:54:20,291 --> 02:54:25,291
you're thinking about a bit and you're 
not thinking about yourself and how the 

4118
02:54:25,291 --> 02:54:28,621
bid is going to work for you and how 
it's going to kill when you get out 

4119
02:54:28,621 --> 02:54:28,621
there,
but when you're stealing,

4120
02:54:28,621 --> 02:54:30,550
if something like say if you have a bit 
about lollipops and I go,

4121
02:54:30,610 --> 02:54:32,020
oh,
I wish that was my bit.

4122
02:54:32,021 --> 02:54:34,480
I'm going to steal that lollipop bit,
that pitt's going to kill,

4123
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:37,890
and then I do that lollipop it and it 
crushes and I call.

4124
02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:39,850
I feel so good when I do that lollipop 
pit,

4125
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:44,970
they get addicted to it.
That's one of the things about people 

4126
02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:44,970
that get called out for bits and they 
say,

4127
02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:48,850
I'm not going to do it anymore,
and then I already did that bit at the 

4128
02:54:48,850 --> 02:54:51,151
laugh factory here because they get 
addicted to get addicted to the 

4129
02:54:51,151 --> 02:54:51,820
reaction.
That bit gets.

4130
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:57,360
See there,
you're addicted to coming up with new 

4131
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:00,541
stuff like an I am and the people that 
are trying to be creative.

4132
02:55:01,180 --> 02:55:04,550
What you're trying to do is you have.
You're trying to like summon

4133
02:55:04,550 --> 02:55:09,550
these ideas out of the ether.
You're trying to pull them out of the 

4134
02:55:09,550 --> 02:55:10,160
air and then once you have them like,
okay,

4135
02:55:10,161 --> 02:55:11,570
I got it in a bottle,
I got it in a bottle,

4136
02:55:11,571 --> 02:55:13,200
okay,
now I've got to add things to it.

4137
02:55:13,450 --> 02:55:18,450
I've got to bring it alive.
I gotta fucking frankenstein and it's 

4138
02:55:18,450 --> 02:55:19,220
alive,
and then one day,

4139
02:55:19,221 --> 02:55:24,221
months and months later you trot that 
bid out of the improvident fucking 

4140
02:55:24,221 --> 02:55:26,360
crushes and that is one of the most 
amazing feelings.

4141
02:55:27,030 --> 02:55:30,230
Like someone like sam tripoli or bill 
burke come up and go,

4142
02:55:30,290 --> 02:55:31,240
dude,
I love that.

4143
02:55:31,480 --> 02:55:33,800
And just go like,
it's working.

4144
02:55:33,830 --> 02:55:34,800
I got it.
It's pumping.

4145
02:55:34,980 --> 02:55:37,040
We all.
We all love that about each other too.

4146
02:55:37,041 --> 02:55:39,680
I love when someone's got a new bit.
I think it was that new.

4147
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:41,720
What has that been like?
Oh dude,

4148
02:55:42,050 --> 02:55:44,510
your last hour that comes out tonIght at
midnight.

4149
02:55:44,810 --> 02:55:47,500
I remember watching you run it in the or
at the.

4150
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:49,640
At its infancy probably like eight 
months ago.

4151
02:55:49,820 --> 02:55:54,820
Right when I was getting ready to in 
february when I was getting ready to 

4152
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:54,820
tape my special,
I saw you doing yours and I was like,

4153
02:55:55,190 --> 02:55:56,810
oh shit.
Is this your new material?

4154
02:55:56,870 --> 02:55:57,350
And you're like,
yeah,

4155
02:55:57,351 --> 02:55:59,100
I'm getting ready to film and you know,
a couple of months.

4156
02:55:59,101 --> 02:56:00,110
And I was like,
oh,

4157
02:56:00,111 --> 02:56:03,200
like dude,
that's the greatest feeling when you sit

4158
02:56:03,201 --> 02:56:05,990
as a comic in the back and you watch 
your friends just fucking murderer.

4159
02:56:05,991 --> 02:56:08,210
It's inspires you with shit you haven't 
heard.

4160
02:56:08,270 --> 02:56:09,080
Yeah,
yeah.

4161
02:56:09,170 --> 02:56:10,310
Oh,
that's the best.

4162
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:12,380
But people that still will never get 
that.

4163
02:56:12,440 --> 02:56:14,990
They will never get it.
They're missing that.

4164
02:56:15,310 --> 02:56:16,850
The,
it's sad.

4165
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:21,440
It's a sad thing because they're always 
going to have to live this weird lie.

4166
02:56:22,310 --> 02:56:27,310
You know,
he does weird lie of creativity because 

4167
02:56:27,310 --> 02:56:30,410
creativity is so slippery and you can't 
be thinking about yourself.

4168
02:56:30,440 --> 02:56:33,290
That's not what it's about.
It's the opposite about that.

4169
02:56:33,291 --> 02:56:38,291
It's all about the idea.
It's all about how it gets to the 

4170
02:56:38,291 --> 02:56:38,480
people.
It's all about how it works.

4171
02:56:38,481 --> 02:56:41,660
Like you have to like take yourself 
literally out of the equation.

4172
02:56:42,170 --> 02:56:44,600
But the people still there,
it's all about them.

4173
02:56:44,900 --> 02:56:47,390
It's all about them getting a good 
feeling,

4174
02:56:47,391 --> 02:56:51,270
doing someone else's bit.
And I really think that that is.

4175
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:55,160
There's this weird balance to the world 
and I think when when you do that,

4176
02:56:55,161 --> 02:57:00,161
I think it takes away from your ability 
to do the other thing takes away from 

4177
02:57:00,161 --> 02:57:03,881
your ability to be creative.
I would almost argue I'm the exact 

4178
02:57:03,881 --> 02:57:06,491
opposite.
When it gets up and running and 

4179
02:57:06,491 --> 02:57:08,890
murderous.
I almost feel like I'm lying to the 

4180
02:57:08,890 --> 02:57:08,890
audience.
Like I'm cheating going,

4181
02:57:08,890 --> 02:57:08,930
going like,
you know,

4182
02:57:08,931 --> 02:57:10,400
it works.
I've been doing it too long.

4183
02:57:10,430 --> 02:57:12,290
I have a hard time doing sets of the 
store when I'm.

4184
02:57:12,350 --> 02:57:13,700
When I got my hour ready,
I go,

4185
02:57:13,750 --> 02:57:15,440
what am I doing going there for?
I'm going to.

4186
02:57:15,450 --> 02:57:20,450
I'm still in a spot from someone who 
couldn't use it and I'm just going up 

4187
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:20,450
with shit that works.
Like,

4188
02:57:20,450 --> 02:57:20,840
oh,
come on bert.

4189
02:57:21,050 --> 02:57:26,050
Yeah,
but you're giving the audience a good 

4190
02:57:26,050 --> 02:57:26,050
time and you're keeping everything 
sharp.

4191
02:57:26,050 --> 02:57:27,290
That's the other thing,
like once a bit is done,

4192
02:57:27,291 --> 02:57:32,000
it's you can't just leave it alone 
because like if I had to today go up and

4193
02:57:32,001 --> 02:57:35,840
do my bruce jenner bit,
wouldn't be able to do it.

4194
02:57:35,870 --> 02:57:38,150
I don't know how to do it.
Haven't done it in two years.

4195
02:57:38,300 --> 02:57:42,110
I literally wouldn't be able to do it is
one of my best bits ever and I wouldn't.

4196
02:57:42,170 --> 02:57:43,970
I wouldn't know where to start.
I would have to go back,

4197
02:57:44,210 --> 02:57:49,210
listen to it,
and then I would have to go do it a 

4198
02:57:49,210 --> 02:57:49,210
bunch of times.
It's get it polished.

4199
02:57:49,210 --> 02:57:54,080
It's really fun though.
When someone calls out a joke that you 

4200
02:57:54,080 --> 02:57:55,070
haven't told in years and you're like,
I did it this past week.

4201
02:57:55,071 --> 02:57:56,270
I do.
I do an hour,

4202
02:57:56,271 --> 02:58:01,271
25 minutes,
show our 20th show where I do my new 

4203
02:58:01,271 --> 02:58:01,500
hour and then at the end of whatever 
bits want to hear,

4204
02:58:01,501 --> 02:58:01,920
I'll tell

4205
02:58:02,190 --> 02:58:07,190
you that's nice and a two man show.
So you have someone do 15 minutes and I 

4206
02:58:07,190 --> 02:58:11,031
do the rest and that way I feel like 
people definitely want to hear flying 

4207
02:58:11,031 --> 02:58:14,781
dildos are the machine or someone called
out a mexican kid in the elevator and I 

4208
02:58:14,821 --> 02:58:16,080
was like,
whoa,

4209
02:58:16,470 --> 02:58:18,940
I haven't done that since my first 
special comments.

4210
02:58:19,060 --> 02:58:20,370
I do it.
I didn't.

4211
02:58:20,450 --> 02:58:23,730
And so I started doing it and I was 
like,

4212
02:58:23,790 --> 02:58:25,180
and I was,
and I just kinda,

4213
02:58:25,320 --> 02:58:27,600
you're my muscle memory goes back in and
then you're like,

4214
02:58:27,601 --> 02:58:32,601
and you're so much better of a comedian 
now that the things that you would have 

4215
02:58:32,601 --> 02:58:33,450
never said back then,
she didn't know how to do it.

4216
02:58:33,660 --> 02:58:36,480
You just start adding ad libs in and it 
just kills.

4217
02:58:36,481 --> 02:58:37,530
And you're like,
shit man.

4218
02:58:37,720 --> 02:58:40,000
I had a guy come on stage once.
He asked me to do a bit.

4219
02:58:40,001 --> 02:58:41,530
I go,
I don't remember how to do a bed.

4220
02:58:41,531 --> 02:58:42,040
He goes,
I do.

4221
02:58:42,041 --> 02:58:42,550
I go,
get up,

4222
02:58:42,551 --> 02:58:45,710
you're a bitch.
That stage.

4223
02:58:46,030 --> 02:58:48,280
And I had him kind of do the bed.
I go,

4224
02:58:48,310 --> 02:58:49,240
yeah,
I remember that part.

4225
02:58:49,241 --> 02:58:49,870
Okay,
okay.

4226
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:50,650
You know,

4227
02:58:50,700 --> 02:58:54,270
I saw some guy on instagram,
uh,

4228
02:58:54,560 --> 02:58:55,830
did he goes,
uh,

4229
02:58:55,890 --> 02:59:00,890
he was doing my machine bit as a joke,
like he's an open mic or is this maybe 

4230
02:59:00,890 --> 02:59:02,340
it's 10 time on stage or whatever.
And his friends,

4231
02:59:02,341 --> 02:59:03,630
I guess her fans.
And he was like,

4232
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:05,820
when I was 22 I got involved with the 
restroom,

4233
02:59:05,821 --> 02:59:07,590
my machine,
or with the russian mafia,

4234
02:59:07,591 --> 02:59:12,591
here's how it happened.
And they all started laughing and he 

4235
02:59:12,591 --> 02:59:12,591
goes,
I'm just kidding.

4236
02:59:12,591 --> 02:59:13,110
I ain't doing that shit.
But it made me giggle because he missed.

4237
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:14,760
He misspoke.
It's not the way I say it.

4238
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:16,110
I,
I got,

4239
02:59:16,260 --> 02:59:21,260
I got in a scuffle with the russian 
mafia or something and it made me 

4240
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:21,390
giggle.
Hilarious.

4241
02:59:21,560 --> 02:59:22,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

4242
02:59:22,381 --> 02:59:23,340
It's weird

4243
02:59:23,570 --> 02:59:28,570
how people interpret your.
Like when you do something and then 

4244
02:59:28,570 --> 02:59:32,800
people really like it and they take it 
and they make a clip about it or 

4245
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:33,440
something,
or they add something to it or they.

4246
02:59:33,790 --> 02:59:36,890
One of the weirder things has been the 
animated shit that people do.

4247
02:59:37,190 --> 02:59:38,560
Yeah.
You know,

4248
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:40,100
she's just like,
you go.

4249
02:59:40,730 --> 02:59:45,730
You were talking about this the other 
day that when you're in this room and 

4250
02:59:45,730 --> 02:59:50,681
you're doing this podcast,
it just seems like you and me are 

4251
02:59:50,681 --> 02:59:50,681
talking.
That's one of the reasons why it works,

4252
02:59:50,681 --> 02:59:55,601
or you and me and whoever else is here,
but the people that hear it,

4253
02:59:56,140 --> 02:59:59,420
you're the actual numbers that you're 
dealing with.

4254
02:59:59,660 --> 03:00:04,660
You're dealing with millions of people 
like that doesn't seem to register in 

4255
03:00:04,660 --> 03:00:08,351
your head.
And then you'll see these clips and you 

4256
03:00:08,351 --> 03:00:09,620
see like these memes and you'll see like
these videos and ucf,

4257
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:14,390
these animated shorts and you see people
do impressions of you and you're like,

4258
03:00:14,391 --> 03:00:15,350
wait,
what?

4259
03:00:15,950 --> 03:00:18,170
What the fuck is that?
It takes.

4260
03:00:18,171 --> 03:00:23,171
And then You'll see people get tattoos 
of your face on their ass or something 

4261
03:00:23,171 --> 03:00:23,570
like that.
Like on your calf.

4262
03:00:23,571 --> 03:00:28,571
They get you smiling,
your beard and you're on theIr calf and 

4263
03:00:28,571 --> 03:00:28,571
you're like,
what the fuck?

4264
03:00:28,670 --> 03:00:29,840
The machine,
it'll take.

4265
03:00:29,970 --> 03:00:34,490
Like I saw a dude who have that russian 
tee-shirt tattooed on his body.

4266
03:00:34,640 --> 03:00:36,950
The one that you made with the machine 
with russian language,

4267
03:00:36,951 --> 03:00:38,510
with you,
like looking off into space.

4268
03:00:39,220 --> 03:00:40,920
I was like,
whoa,

4269
03:00:40,950 --> 03:00:41,280
fucking

4270
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:43,430
insane swearing.
It's insane.

4271
03:00:43,650 --> 03:00:45,510
Especially like,
I mean when I,

4272
03:00:45,540 --> 03:00:48,240
when I saw that joe rogan means road 
yogan,

4273
03:00:48,870 --> 03:00:51,690
I was just use the guy's a wizard.
Whoever did that shit.

4274
03:00:51,900 --> 03:00:56,550
I had gotten done a show in oxnard and 
my kids were in the other room.

4275
03:00:56,551 --> 03:00:58,410
My wife is a new one out with you and 
you know,

4276
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,800
I just,
it

4277
03:01:00,190 --> 03:01:05,190
stops talking shit that made me,
that made me giggle so hard.

4278
03:01:06,970 --> 03:01:11,970
I could not,
the ini just gotten high and I was in a 

4279
03:01:11,970 --> 03:01:12,650
room by myself.
My famIly is in another room and I,

4280
03:01:13,620 --> 03:01:14,380
I was like,
dude,

4281
03:01:14,410 --> 03:01:19,410
I wish.
I hope this guy knows how much joy he 

4282
03:01:19,410 --> 03:01:19,410
just gave me.
Like whatever I was thinking about,

4283
03:01:19,410 --> 03:01:19,990
you know,
like my sat or whatever.

4284
03:01:20,200 --> 03:01:22,120
I'm dying fucking laughing.
I was like,

4285
03:01:22,121 --> 03:01:23,020
dude,
thank you man.

4286
03:01:23,410 --> 03:01:28,410
Well,
it's the amount of effort that it takes 

4287
03:01:28,410 --> 03:01:30,571
to listen to so much audio that you can 
have a conversation back and forth 

4288
03:01:30,571 --> 03:01:33,730
between a dude and his self.
LIke,

4289
03:01:33,760 --> 03:01:38,760
you know,
how many videos that guy must have had 

4290
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:38,760
to listen to and how much editing he had
to do to do that too.

4291
03:01:38,760 --> 03:01:40,870
I want a fanboy out,
but I'm a huge fan and it cuts to you.

4292
03:01:40,930 --> 03:01:42,700
I was pissing myself.

4293
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:44,880
I literally hit paul.
You know what?

4294
03:01:44,900 --> 03:01:46,210
Like when you get excited and you're 
like,

4295
03:01:46,310 --> 03:01:47,800
I think you had sent it to me.
Maybe.

4296
03:01:48,100 --> 03:01:53,100
Maybe it's somewhat set.
Maybe tommy said it to me and I 

4297
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:53,170
immediately was too late,
but I wanted to text everyone and go,

4298
03:01:53,171 --> 03:01:55,180
I want everyone to see this.
And then when it cut,

4299
03:01:55,420 --> 03:01:56,540
by the way,
I'm already giggling some,

4300
03:01:56,590 --> 03:02:01,590
you know,
and then when it cuts to me as the main 

4301
03:02:01,590 --> 03:02:03,831
ge chimp,
I fucking howling howling and I'm 

4302
03:02:04,151 --> 03:02:05,400
excited.
Chimp,

4303
03:02:05,740 --> 03:02:06,550
like,
oh jesus,

4304
03:02:07,810 --> 03:02:10,870
I'll rip your dick off.
Yeah,

4305
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:13,690
no fucking.
And then when he just did the new one,

4306
03:02:13,990 --> 03:02:15,440
I got to go pick up my daughter,
uh,

4307
03:02:15,500 --> 03:02:18,190
when he just did the new one on me 
drinking 30 to 35.

4308
03:02:18,310 --> 03:02:20,050
Yeah.
This pr firms,

4309
03:02:20,051 --> 03:02:22,510
that time warp it really is,
is,

4310
03:02:22,540 --> 03:02:27,540
it's a time warp.
When the fuck do you ever sit down and 

4311
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:27,540
talk to somebody for three hours?

4312
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:28,270
So the best.
It's the best thing about these podcasts

4313
03:02:28,290 --> 03:02:31,510
is that you literally sit and catch up 
and break balls and giggle,

4314
03:02:31,900 --> 03:02:34,870
come up with brilliant challenges due to
its changed me.

4315
03:02:35,050 --> 03:02:36,550
It's changed me as a person.
My,

4316
03:02:36,640 --> 03:02:41,640
my ability to communicate is so much.
I'm just so much better at it than I was

4317
03:02:42,011 --> 03:02:43,750
nine years ago when I first started 
doing this.

4318
03:02:43,960 --> 03:02:45,220
You really are there.
I mean,

4319
03:02:45,230 --> 03:02:45,550
I,
I,

4320
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:48,180
I can say this as a fan,
I think anyone who listens,

4321
03:02:48,190 --> 03:02:51,130
I've been listening to podcasts.
I always listen to the podcast.

4322
03:02:51,550 --> 03:02:56,550
You've changed immeasurably in almost 
the most renaissance way is like you 

4323
03:02:57,281 --> 03:03:02,281
have conversations with people.
I wouldn't know what the fUck they even 

4324
03:03:02,281 --> 03:03:05,190
do,
but there's still hints oF exaCtly who 

4325
03:03:05,190 --> 03:03:08,101
you are.
You're very measured and what you say 

4326
03:03:08,101 --> 03:03:08,101
and how you put out your ideas.
You listen,

4327
03:03:08,101 --> 03:03:08,350
you're willing to change.

4328
03:03:08,350 --> 03:03:09,760
I remember when you stopped saying 
faggot,

4329
03:03:09,790 --> 03:03:11,380
I remember when you were like,
you know what,

4330
03:03:11,381 --> 03:03:14,500
I think I'm going to stop saying that.
Like in conversation.

4331
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:16,090
I remember I was like,
oh,

4332
03:03:16,091 --> 03:03:18,010
that's a good idea.
Maybe I'll just stop to.

4333
03:03:18,070 --> 03:03:20,180
We were in the old desk squad,
uh,

4334
03:03:20,290 --> 03:03:22,330
east or west.
Was it?

4335
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:23,350
Oh,
in pasadena.

4336
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:24,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

4337
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:29,580
Well the problem is,
it's a fun thing to say and you don't 

4338
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:32,911
mean it in a homophobic way.
It's stills fun to say I still let it 

4339
03:03:32,911 --> 03:03:33,130
slip out every now and then.
Age,

4340
03:03:33,131 --> 03:03:35,440
like a fine wine.
It's a fun thing to say,

4341
03:03:35,441 --> 03:03:37,660
but the problem is the way it makes 
other people feel.

4342
03:03:37,661 --> 03:03:42,550
It's not fun.
It's language should be about intent.

4343
03:03:42,670 --> 03:03:46,870
It should be about you're conveying your
intent through a sound.

4344
03:03:46,940 --> 03:03:51,940
Yeah,
but the problem is it's not working 

4345
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:51,940
correctly.
Like if,

4346
03:03:51,940 --> 03:03:55,610
if someone is hearing it on the other 
end and it's making them angry and 

4347
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:55,610
you're like,
but no,

4348
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:55,610
I'm silly.
I'm being silly about it.

4349
03:03:55,610 --> 03:03:57,700
I'm gonna silly faggot.
Like they're like,

4350
03:03:58,050 --> 03:03:58,500
no,
no,

4351
03:03:58,501 --> 03:03:59,150
no.
You can't.

4352
03:03:59,151 --> 03:03:59,630
Like,
okay,

4353
03:03:59,631 --> 03:04:04,631
well it's not.
This is an ineffective use of sound to 

4354
03:04:04,631 --> 03:04:04,631
convey my thoughts.
Yeah,

4355
03:04:04,670 --> 03:04:08,540
and is it worth it to piss people off?
You know,

4356
03:04:08,541 --> 03:04:09,590
is it worth it?
Like,

4357
03:04:09,591 --> 03:04:13,340
look what happened with tommy and the 
word retard,

4358
03:04:13,400 --> 03:04:16,560
which he's not calling anyone that it's 
not the,

4359
03:04:17,020 --> 03:04:20,510
the bid is about forbidden language and 
he literally.

4360
03:04:20,511 --> 03:04:25,070
All he said in that bit was that you're 
not allowed to use that word anyMore.

4361
03:04:25,340 --> 03:04:28,640
and in saying that there was massive 
protests.

4362
03:04:28,641 --> 03:04:33,641
There's all these people freaking out 
because they don't even want you to 

4363
03:04:33,641 --> 03:04:35,240
utter the sound.
It's a real problem because that kind of

4364
03:04:35,241 --> 03:04:40,241
thinking is nonsense.
Like this to say that it can't be used 

4365
03:04:40,241 --> 03:04:42,050
ever,
that you can't admit that it's a word,

4366
03:04:42,290 --> 03:04:44,630
like you cannot say it,
you cannot utter it,

4367
03:04:44,631 --> 03:04:46,790
but it's abracadabra,
that it's a magic word.

4368
03:04:47,270 --> 03:04:49,190
You can't even bring it up in 
conversation.

4369
03:04:49,240 --> 03:04:51,650
Who had to understand that we are 
changing.

4370
03:04:51,770 --> 03:04:53,960
So this word,
whatever the word is,

4371
03:04:54,140 --> 03:04:59,140
that you can't say it anymore because 
remember they were trying to get rid of 

4372
03:04:59,140 --> 03:04:59,140
bossy.
Do you remember bossing?

4373
03:04:59,140 --> 03:04:59,520
No.
Yeah,

4374
03:04:59,530 --> 03:05:04,530
yeah.
They were trying to say that bossy is a 

4375
03:05:04,530 --> 03:05:04,530
sexist word.
You shouldn't use bossy.

4376
03:05:04,530 --> 03:05:07,220
They abandoned it,
but it's that point is that they'll,

4377
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:12,340
they'll try to find something to be 
offended by and they'll try to put 

4378
03:05:12,340 --> 03:05:15,680
whatever that word is into this 
forbidden category and then you can have

4379
03:05:15,681 --> 03:05:19,100
so many words in that category.
Then it's going to be crazy and then you

4380
03:05:19,101 --> 03:05:24,101
have noises that you can't make.
I think the real thing that's going to 

4381
03:05:24,101 --> 03:05:24,650
change and I really think this is going 
to happen,

4382
03:05:24,830 --> 03:05:29,830
is we're going to figure out a way to 
bypass language is going to be weighted 

4383
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:33,180
to directly convey information to people
without language and it's going to 

4384
03:05:33,180 --> 03:05:37,721
happen through some sort of technology 
and elon musk was talking about it on 

4385
03:05:37,721 --> 03:05:40,580
the podcast or something called neuro 
link that he's working on that some sort

4386
03:05:40,581 --> 03:05:45,581
of a really revolutionary way to 
increase bandwidth between you and ideas

4387
03:05:47,211 --> 03:05:48,470
and how ideas get to your head.

4388
03:05:48,470 --> 03:05:52,160
It's going to Be something that you were
and I think that's going to be like step

4389
03:05:52,161 --> 03:05:55,700
one and then you're going to be able to 
do that from person to person.

4390
03:05:56,090 --> 03:06:01,090
And I think you know,
all this were so invasive now with 

4391
03:06:01,090 --> 03:06:02,870
social media like it's so and cell 
phones and electronics.

4392
03:06:02,900 --> 03:06:07,900
everything is in your life and people 
are getting closer and closer to each 

4393
03:06:07,900 --> 03:06:10,931
other.
And one of the Side effects is that of 

4394
03:06:10,931 --> 03:06:12,740
that is that people now realize they can
hurt you so they can attack you easier.

4395
03:06:12,741 --> 03:06:16,190
And they go and they can tear things 
down to can light things on fire because

4396
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:21,191
they can,
not necessarily because it's a wise 

4397
03:06:21,191 --> 03:06:22,370
thing or it's a measureD thing or it's a
really well thought out thing.

4398
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:25,280
They're doing it just Because it's a new
thing that they can use.

4399
03:06:25,281 --> 03:06:29,000
Like you gave a chimp and ak 47 and they
just started shooting up the jungle.

4400
03:06:29,120 --> 03:06:32,180
I mean literally that is what a lot of 
people were doing with social media,

4401
03:06:32,330 --> 03:06:37,330
but I think that is just a stage and 
that eventually we're going to bypass 

4402
03:06:37,330 --> 03:06:38,360
language.
I really do.

4403
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:42,320
I really think that the thing it's going
to be like emojis,

4404
03:06:42,750 --> 03:06:46,730
that way they can communicate through 
like a form of hieroglyphics almost.

4405
03:06:46,760 --> 03:06:48,890
This is a conversation that you need to 
have a November 5th one.

4406
03:06:48,891 --> 03:06:51,560
I'm high.
We're going to be bang big drunk.

4407
03:06:51,561 --> 03:06:53,990
Fucked up November 5th.
I can't fucking wait.

4408
03:06:54,140 --> 03:06:55,530
let's wrap this up.
So,

4409
03:06:55,531 --> 03:06:55,980
uh,
we

4410
03:06:55,980 --> 03:06:58,720
kind of have a parameter.
We'll figure it out as we go along.

4411
03:06:58,770 --> 03:06:59,580
Got it written.
All right.

4412
03:06:59,581 --> 03:07:00,930
Here.
I'll take a picture and leave it here.

4413
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:04,260
All right.
But I figured this is awesome.

4414
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:05,970
This is awesome.
It's going to be awesome.

4415
03:07:05,971 --> 03:07:08,850
The belts going to be shit because we're
