normally have to do in a legal office.
Go to a law firm, make an appointment,

00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:00,780
sit down, talk to a lawyer, pay
an exorbitant amount of money.

A lot of that shit you can do at home

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,680
Rogan checkout,

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,860
is that your phone man and seeing the
way it does know how to use vibrate.

49
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,993
Here it is.

50
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,230
Legal Zoom provides legal help through
independent attorneys and self and self

51
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,070
help,
but they are not a law firm.

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,420
They can connect you with an in an
independent attorney though if you panic,

53
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,870
if you were in the middle of doing all
this stuff and filling out your forms and

54
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,570
you're like, you know what, I
don't know if this is right.

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,380
They will connect you with a
third party independent attorney,

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,670
but you probably won't need it. Everyone
that I know that's used did Brian,

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,470
red bands used it. Aubrey
Marcus used it, the form on it.

58
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,600
They did it all by themselves. Um,
super easy to do. Go to legal zoom.com.

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,430
Use the code word Rogan.
We're also brought to you by on it.com.

60
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,431
That's o n n I t on it is a
human optimization website.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
We sell all of the best shit that we
can find that helps physical performance

62
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:57,160
helps proper proper performance.
What's wrong with my fucking mouth today?

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,263
Yesterday too.

64
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,480
Something about a little something
about being up in Canada for too long.

65
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,380
They got me those fucks. Um, we, we,

66
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,970
we find everything that can weather
it can help cognitive performance,

67
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:11,410
whether it can help your endurance.

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,680
Anything that we find that's great for
as far as strength and conditioning

69
00:04:14,681 --> 00:04:17,670
equipment,
we try to sell it at on it,

70
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,840
including our kettle bell series.

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,800
My favorite exercise as far as strength
and conditioning without a doubt is

72
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,870
kettle bells.
I think they're incredibly versatile.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,240
There's so many different exercises
you can do with them. And uh,

74
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,130
we sell a wide variety
of sizes and weights.

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,600
We have weights that go,
we have a bunch of different packages.

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,220
If you go to the kettle bell section,

77
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:43,360
you could see the men's beginner
kettlebell section, which has a 20,

78
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:45,970
a 16 and a 12 kilobytes kilobytes,

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,640
kilogram key low.

80
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,250
That's how they say it in those other
countries that use the metric system.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,830
But we're like over here in
America, we're like, no, no, no,

82
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,110
we're gonna stick with pounds and inches.

83
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,170
Some stupid shit that doesn't make any
sense while the rest of the world use

84
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,240
kilos.
When you go over to Canada,

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,690
they have kilometers on the mile and you
just look at the, you're going, I'm like,

86
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,390
we're not going a hundred miles an hour.
No, we're going a hundred kilometers.

87
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,770
Well, what the fuck is that? Oh, it's 50
Celsius today. What are you even saying?

88
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,280
What does that mean? It's not 50
degrees outside. No, no, no. 50 Celsius.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Take a liter of gas. Yeah, liter of gas.
But the fuck is that. This is nonsense.

90
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,730
Um, bunch of packages including the,
uh, advanced kettlebell package,

91
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,970
which has a 20, at 24 and at 28. Um,

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,180
and all the way up to, it's a pretty
heavy ones too. We have a 40 kilogram,

93
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,080
which is I think 90 pounds.
That's 40, 90 pounds,

94
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,910
something like that.
It's like 2.2 pounds per kilogram.

95
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:47,470
Let's find out what that
is. 40 kilograms. 40 kilos.

96
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,620
I'd say it's 90, 96. Is it 96

97
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,620
times 2.2? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, do you know
that right? Because you live in Japan,

98
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,740
in Japan, these kilograms, right? Yeah.
What the fuck is wrong with America?

99
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,330
I don't know, man. Why? Why don't you know
they tried that shit when I was a kid.

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,120
I remember when I was a kid,
there was, there was a, um,

101
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,020
a whole push to get everybody to
you use the metric system. 88, 88.

102
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,580
That's what it is. Okay. 88, 88.184,

103
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:24,440
nine pounds is 40 kilograms. Um,
essentially pretty close to 90 pounds.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,750
Um, so we have basically, if you
can work out with those killer,

105
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,350
if you could work out with two 40
pound or two 40 kilo kettlebells,

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,670
you're a fucking monster.
I mean,

107
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:39,671
that's like a heavyweight would work out
with two 40 pound kilos and 40 pounds.

108
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,450
What the fuck is wrong with me? 40 Kilo
kettlebells and get an awesome workout.

109
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,880
I've got to talk like a moron. I can't
free ball this early in the morning.

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,440
It just doesn't work. Um,
we also sell battle ropes,

111
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,940
weight vests.

112
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,080
Basically anything that you'd need for a
comprehensive strength and conditioning

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,920
program. You never need to go to a gym
again. You could buy all your shit on it.

114
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,290
If you do do it though,
please.

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,790
If you can't find someone who's a personal
trainer that can guide you and show

116
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,660
you the correct form and technique
for exercises, please start light.

117
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:16,661
Take it slow and look at a video online
and try to do it with a very lightweight

118
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,050
and get the form down.

119
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:21,830
First form is one of the most important
things when it comes to any strength and

120
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,510
conditioning program
that involves weights.

121
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,670
You can do it and do it healthily and do
it safely and work out and get in great

122
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:32,540
shape. But if you do a goofy,
you will fucking hurt yourself.

123
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:36,470
If you throw it around big heavy iron
cannonballs with handles on them,

124
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,810
it's very possible you're
going to fuck yourself up.

125
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,560
So don't be a macho meathead
like me and start off slow.

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,620
Start off light and learn the proper form.
Um,

127
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,100
if you want a good workout DVD to
follow, we have an excellent one. It's,

128
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,043
it's Keith.

129
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,430
I'm Keith Weber's extreme
kettlebell cardio workout series.

130
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,930
They're fantastic. I use
them all the time. Um,

131
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,180
they're like one of my best as far as
like getting a good workout in 20 minutes.

132
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,590
You can get,
if you use Keith Weber series,

133
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:10,460
you can get a workout that will give you
a fucking heart attack with a 45 pound

134
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:13,550
kettle bell and you could do it in
a half an hour and I'm not kidding.

135
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,820
It will break you down even if
you were in really good shape.

136
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,370
He has a two excellent ones,

137
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,580
extreme kettle bell to a cardio workout
DVD and one and we have a ton of other

138
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:31,250
ones that are available at on it including
fitness function, a Kettlebell DVD.

139
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,870
We have ones for women,

140
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,640
the Bell Babe Kettlebell
DVD with Donica Storino.

141
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,930
I would change the name of that
Bell Bay please. Seriously,

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,230
she has pink kettle bells to

Joe Rogan podcast all day,

164
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,170
way, way, way, way back in. I think it was

165
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,250
1998 I first got to meet ensign when you
aren't barred. Nice. Seven. They said,

166
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,060
wow,

167
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,060
you onboard Royce Alger and Royce Alger
was the one of the latest and greatest

168
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:21,941
of the wrestlers.

169
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:26,230
It was entering into the UFC and they
were going to take the place like mark,

170
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,740
there was a Mark Coleman era when Mark
Coleman was smashing everybody and it was

171
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,510
255 pounds solid muscle. Kevin
Jackson beat John Lewis then to yeah,

172
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,510
put that thing closer to
your face that we can pay.

173
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,420
You can move it around a little bit.
Yeah. Yeah. Kevin Jackson beat John Lewis.

174
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,590
We had like,

175
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,190
there was like some serious wrestlers
back in that day that we're just starting.

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,630
Like Kenny Monday was entering into MMA.
Did he do,

177
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,740
did he do extreme combat or
[inaudible] and then he did, um,

178
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,790
one of the member they had, um, the same
people. They data submission only thing.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,620
We're frank shamrock took on Dan Henderson
and I'm going to heal ankle lock.

180
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,940
You remember that? Yeah. There was a
lot of that going on, man. It was a lot.

181
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:06,880
All these,
uh,

182
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,990
these high level wrestlers were just
starting to find their way into MMA.

183
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:14,260
They're like, oh, this is
finally an opportunity to, uh,

184
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,390
to use a wrestling skills
and try to tell him.

185
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,060
I saw though wrestlers fight always,
always said it.

186
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,740
They don't understand numbers. It's
true. Yeah. You had a wicked one man.

187
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:26,350
You're one of the few guys
to ever submit Randy couture.

188
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,770
You submitted Randy coture with an arm
bar and before you caught him with that

189
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:30,461
arm bar,
man,

190
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:34,660
you've landed some of the most devastating
kicks from the butt scoot position

191
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,480
I've ever seen.

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,850
Because everybody used to just throw
straight kicks to kick guys off from the

193
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:40,301
butts goop.

194
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:44,530
But you figured out a way to Torque your
hips from the ground you would land.

195
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,070
It's a little late kick. Yeah. And
the nasty leg kick from the ground.

196
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,040
It's kind of interesting because
you don't see that from other dudes.

197
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,130
And even to this day,
that's a rare, you don't,

198
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,330
I think that fight your fight with
Randy coture might've been like the most

199
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:01,930
effective application of those low leg
kicks on the ground I've ever seen. Yeah.

200
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,940
So you all just wanted to,

201
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,720
my whole objective in that fight
was just to keep pressing forward.

202
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:12,610
Just pressure him all the way. Yeah,
that was a, there it is right there.

203
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,670
That was a great fight,
man. That was a great fight.

204
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,790
That was a really interesting fight,
man. You are a wild motherfucker dude.

205
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:23,470
You're one of my all time
favorite fighters to watch
because of that. And your,

206
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:27,550
uh, your style of fighting man was
always, you know, balls to the wall,

207
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:31,930
do or die and die. You know a lot
of people talk that, but you did it.

208
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,740
You did it in every single fight,
man. And you for without a doubt,

209
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:38,500
you have one of the most exciting
mixed martial arts careers ever.

210
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,060
And despite your, you know, your wild,
crazy style, you've got through it,

211
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,760
you're fine man. You all those
years of fighting and you know,

212
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,340
can not stuttering too
much. Not at all, man.

213
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,660
How did you manage to pull that off?
Make him all short and fast, man. Yeah,

214
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,510
this is, yeah, this was
the, the butts goop thing.

215
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,660
You were doing something
totally different because you,

216
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,330
you snuck up on him
like he scooted forward.

217
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,900
Randy was standing right in front of you
but you were blasting them with these

218
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:11,900
like kid, you know, my ankles and my
shins. I had like a whole roll of like,

219
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,380
Oh yeah, you, you really taped it up.
Hard, hard to let it, let us do it.

220
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:20,770
So I was like,
why not like castle my legs?

221
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,440
Oh the men when they used to let
everybody fight with wrestling shoes on,

222
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,640
that was a big thing too.

223
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,070
They used to kick guys in the
face with wrestling shoes,

224
00:13:27,071 --> 00:13:31,090
which I thought maybe okay with
the top of the wrestling shoe,

225
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:34,600
but if you do shit like wheel kicks
and like sidekicks to the face,

226
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,020
you could scratch the fuck out of
someone's I like with the bottom,

227
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:42,820
the texture rubber part of the shoe.
Know that's a, that's a weird thing.

228
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:47,590
When they were the transitionary time
of MMA when they were four sort of first

229
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,850
sorting out the rules.
But this was a big fight because this is,

230
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,030
Randy had left the UFC and a Randy
was one of the elite guys in the UFC.

231
00:13:57,161 --> 00:14:00,330
This is after he had beat v Tour and CPV.
Yeah.

232
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,650
And Randy was known as like one
of the best guys in the world,

233
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,250
but all slapped on that
armbar son and that's it.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,850
And an anyway is a motherfucker.
Ladies and gentlemen,

235
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,750
are you a still training
guys now over in Japan? Um,

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,490
more doing stuff up north there, up
north and my bracelets that said, yeah,

237
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,570
popping in the gym here and there,

238
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,860
but you're still working with the
people near the nuclear plant as you do.

239
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,890
It's still doing that.
Going up to the temporary housing,

240
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,150
what is that situation like up
there for everybody here? You know,

241
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:38,020
you hear a lot of hysteria and you
hear everyone's kind of scared because

242
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:41,500
they're afraid the radiation is getting
into the water and it's coming over to

243
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:46,420
America. What I've read from scientists
that have actually been off the coast of

244
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,830
Fukushima who have,
uh,

245
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,040
analyze the fish is that it's
not something to worry about yet.

246
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,250
They've caught fish

247
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,560
directly off the coast that live there,

248
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,980
that are like not migrating fish and
they say those fissures safe to eat.

249
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,270
It depends on where, where he's talking
with you talking with the power plant. Um,

250
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,030
as of right now,
there's not much of a worry,

251
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,850
but it all depends on what's going to
happen like that because they're getting

252
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,740
too much radioactive waste storage.
You can't store it anymore. Yeah, yeah.

253
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:16,010
They're doing this crazy thing when they
have a pit and they're surrounding the

254
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:17,780
pit with frozen rods,

255
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,200
so they're going to freeze the ground and
turn this pit into this like temporary

256
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,070
housing for all this radioactive water.
When they're getting too much, they can't,

257
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,260
they can't supply it anymore.
They got these big bins of their,

258
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm holding a minute. They're
cracking though. So yes.

259
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:38,750
As far as up by the plant, it's a
lot of radiation. But as far as, um,

260
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,830
the people who were displaced from the
tsunami or from the radiation there,

261
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:47,420
Darren, like a hopeless situation because
they're, they have temporary housing,

262
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,250
which is the box is smaller than this
room and they have to live there with

263
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,150
their families in the true, the winter.
It's like just a small wall that you can,

264
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,110
you can hear the rain hit the
roofs. Yeah. Wow. So it's a,

265
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,690
that has been extended.
It was supposed to be a two year thing.

266
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,130
They extended it for another three.

267
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,830
So that's five and they're still not
going to be able to move on from then.

268
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,070
The government is not helping them.
So why isn't the government helping him?

269
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,330
I don't think they can afford it. Yeah.
Right now, why isn't the world helping?

270
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,220
I mean that's a world issue.
That's a,

271
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,820
I feel like any sort of a
cataclysmic disaster like that,

272
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,850
that is a time where the world
has to show a world community,

273
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,300
forget about all the borders and
nations and all the nonsense.

274
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,290
If there's money that can be donated,
if this people that can be helped,

275
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,700
that's a time to help. I mean that's a
real cluster fuck of a situation do. Yeah.

276
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:38,870
I've been up there a 29 times.
Yeah. Wow. That's amazing.

277
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,600
Still going to continue you.
It's um,

278
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,020
it's kind of shocking how quick
that whole thing went bad.

279
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:47,870
Like everybody thought that when
you see nuclear power plants,

280
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,820
you u s assume they have some sort of
a backup plan. Like if it goes bad,

281
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,470
I didn't know until this,
this event, that power plants,

282
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,180
you can't shut them down. Like I didn't
know that either. Isn't that crazy?

283
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,210
Like what do you mean?
You have to keep them operating?

284
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,240
Like what are you talking about?

285
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:08,690
Like you have to keep them going to
keep them cool. And if you don't,

286
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:10,970
they burn through the
containment and they, you know,

287
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:15,170
they melt the meltdown and go into the
earth and they don't know what the fuck

288
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,290
happened. But then Fukushima
was just, uh, just the,

289
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,740
the size of the earthquake and then the
timing of the tsunami coming in so fast

290
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,130
and so hard.
Yeah.

291
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,080
But it's weird that that's also one of
the things that they do with nuclear

292
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:27,691
power plants,

293
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:30,800
that they put them near the ocean to keep
them cool so they could use the water,

294
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,000
but it's just like, oh,
what the fuck? Really? Yeah.

295
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,720
I learned a lot about nuclear
power plants from that,

296
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,850
from just paying attention
to it because before that I,

297
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,220
I didn't even know what they did.

298
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,640
I thought like the nuclear energy
somehow or another made electricity,

299
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,520
but it's really just make steam.
Yeah, I know that either. Yeah. Yeah.

300
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,180
Like that's still like some
old school method of, you know,

301
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,440
using steam power to create
electricity and you just say,

302
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:00,810
just do it through as it clears out
a lot of them all over the world.

303
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,010
Asking a scarier, when you have an
easy job to San Diego down the coast,

304
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,800
you see them and you're like,
oh Jesus,

305
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:11,770
that's a fucking nuclear power plant
right there. That fucker could go bad to,

306
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,180
all they have to do is get hit
with the wrong natural disasters.

307
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,270
I think the one in Fukushima
though needed to be updated. Right.

308
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,800
It was like an old system,

309
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:23,610
like they didn't have the the right
amount of backup and redundancy as far as

310
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,840
the generators and stuff.

311
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,190
The headline of all reports on it prior
to it and didn't do anything of Bartlett.

312
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,020
So now it's a situation
where the government just
doesn't have enough money to

313
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,830
fix everything.

314
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,140
Yeah, there's too much. Uh, see,

315
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:40,530
the thing is is that they
have a 2020 kilometer radius.

316
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:44,250
Now that is a exclusive zone where
people can go in and out because of the

317
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:44,791
radiation.

318
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:49,791
But in actuality it's supposed to be 30
because when I went in there with my guy

319
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:50,844
or Connor,

320
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,420
I fall in hot spots higher than ones
10 kilometers from the plant and 30

321
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,580
kilometers one day said they can't,

322
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,730
they won't do that because they
can't displace that much more people.

323
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,100
They can't afford it.
And I'm like, I'm like,

324
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:06,930
so you got to let people
live in radiation.

325
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:11,550
It's kind of crazy sometimes weird birth
defects with like rabbits and shit are

326
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,230
born with no ears, which is, yeah.

327
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:17,580
Which is to a human is going to happen in
the next one, eight, seven, eight years.

328
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:21,330
Right. You see about 10 years and before
you start releasing the fix to it.

329
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,350
Oh Wow. Yeah. Yeah. It's a real wake
up call for people and you know,

330
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:30,100
it's, there's not a whole lot of options
as far as like how to generate power.

331
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,540
Nuclear power when you get to large
cities is one of the most effective way to

332
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:37,300
generate power. Yeah. Like people are
protesting to shut them down, man.

333
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,890
What's going to happen if
you shut them down? Yeah,

334
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,890
well I think there's a way that they,

335
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,310
if they have like a
plan to shut them down,

336
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,270
there's a way to maintain it. I'm talking
completely out of my ass by the way,

337
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,050
but from what I've read,
it's,

338
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,210
they can do it much better than if it
just shuts down because of a natural

339
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:59,050
disaster and they can't plan for it, which
is the situation that they're in now.

340
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,330
You know what's crazy is la, because it's
never rainy here, but there's no solar.

341
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,420
Anything like you talk about
like not using a resource.

342
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,200
Every fucking building in la
should be covered in solar panels.

343
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,560
They should get all of their electricity
from the sucks big business I guess.

344
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,890
Huh? It should. Someone should bring
that in because it's all over Hawaii.

345
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm doing it at my house and I have a,

346
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,720
my neighbor doesn't have
electrical bills anymore. He,

347
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,250
everything he gets is
from the sun. Yeah. His,

348
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,130
no electricity doesn't pay
for electricity at all.

349
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,920
These like some maintenance and like the,

350
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,330
apparently the batteries lose a certain
amount of effectiveness every year.

351
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:38,020
I have very slight amount and over a
course of like 10 years, it could be like,

352
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,840
you know, come a certain percentage
and then it becomes noticeable.

353
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,680
But then you just replace the batteries.
My house in Hawaii we got like,

354
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:48,850
I think 70% of the roof is covered
with really? Yeah, cos it a lot.

355
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,180
But I heard it brings on your
electric bill. Yeah. Big Time. Yeah.

356
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,300
Well in Hawaii you could also
collect rainwater to, and who know,

357
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,900
I know a lot of people that do that.
I knew a dude who lived up in, um,

358
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,530
he lived up on Mauna Loa and
he had a whole system set up.

359
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:06,430
Like you just lived up there.
He had a solar electricity,

360
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,050
he had a rain water that they collected
in a bin because it rains up there.

361
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:15,310
He was in the, the, this is,
if you've been to the big
island, the big island you,

362
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm sure you've had.
But for folks who haven't,

363
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,370
the big island has like a bunch of
different ecosystems. It's like desert,

364
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,190
like arid, dry climate. And
then you go to another place,

365
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:27,880
it's like near Hilo is like a
God damn rain forest. It's crazy.

366
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,380
It's like a Polynesian tropical rain
forest and that's where this dude lived.

367
00:21:32,381 --> 00:21:36,040
And he collected rainwater up there and
that's how he got all of his water and

368
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:40,270
all electricity just for mother earth
girls on food and his garden. Crazy.

369
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,150
Just lived up there. You know, you're, um,

370
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,970
the island itself, it's like one of
the most magical places on earth,

371
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,330
you know. I mean, all the Hawaiian
islands are pretty God damn magical, but,

372
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,470
but the big island itself, it's just
incredible. That's active volcano.

373
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,390
Yes. Constantly getting
bigger. Give a fly over.

374
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:04,000
You do the helicopter tour.
Um, no, I never did that.

375
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,910
I went and saw the at the
observatory though. Oh, the,
yeah, the the, the way. Uh,

376
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,230
yeah, the um, um,

377
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,920
the helicopter tours pretty dope
because you get to see the lava actually

378
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:17,050
pouring into the ocean. Oh really? Yeah.

379
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:21,190
You see the big island Grotzia hitting
bigger. Yeah. You can see a grill.

380
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,110
It's wild.
It's just all steam.

381
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,160
Like you can see the red lava going into
the ocean and then you see the steam

382
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:31,740
coming off and you literally
watching the island grow. Oh Wow.

383
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,070
Yeah, it's pretty
intense. It's pretty cool.

384
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,210
And also on the big island,

385
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:40,930
they have all these areas where you
could see like photos of houses that were

386
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:45,100
lost when the lava came down and just
wiped out certain towns that were just a

387
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,790
little freaky thing that you,

388
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,770
you have a house and you see the
love of coming out about what?

389
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,780
Like a mile per hour. Not even though
and you just can't do nothing about it.

390
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,990
Nothing. There's nothing you can do
to stop it. Nothing but just watching.

391
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,690
I mean the think the big dig a big
hole debts or pour water on it.

392
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,660
It was just hard in it.

393
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,370
Now there's nothing you can do
and it just, cause it's slowly,

394
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,970
well it's amazing is, it's so beautiful
there. People don't give a shit.

395
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,440
They're like, so what? We'll rebuild.

396
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,540
But that's still better than living on
the mainland. When you lived in Hawaii,

397
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,380
did you get a, did you get island fever?
What do you mean? When I was away,

398
00:23:23,381 --> 00:23:27,370
I missed it. No island fever, like living
there. Were you like, it's too small.

399
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,040
Like you feel like you've got to
get never did. Now I love the ocean.

400
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:34,610
That's why so a lot of diving, a
lot of surfing and I was good. I,

401
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,070
I missed it whenever I went away though.

402
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,270
Isn't your brothers like some
crazy free diving champion? Ryan,

403
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,230
we can hold this [inaudible]
seven minutes. He's a surfer now.

404
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,010
How long can he hold his
breath for? I don't know. He
used to go on deep. Does this

405
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,220
go into deep blue? That was
beyond, that was after my time.

406
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,470
We used to just free dive night dive,

407
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,820
but that thing about going down a hundred
feet and that kind of stuff is crazy.

408
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,950
Yeah. He had a ridiculous ability
to hold a breath. Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,040
If a lot of people don't know your
brother was a badass mixed martial arts

410
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:08,690
fighter to this. A lot of stuff.
Man. Paul Champion, whatever he does,

411
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:13,490
he does good. Yeah. Racquetball Chap
who, um, Shih Tzu did him in May.

412
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,840
He was going to go into dentistry.
He, he had his massage license.

413
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,450
Wow. He was a pharmacist.
Pharmaceutical Rep for Merck. Wow.

414
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,090
What's he doing now? He's
doing a bootcamp. No. Oh,

415
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:32,030
like a bootcamp training.
I think he'd take everyday man.

416
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,890
He's up at five in the morning teaching
classes. Wow. And why? Yeah. And uh,

417
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:41,120
which uh, Honolulu in Honolulu right near
it. Right in town or I didn't tell him.

418
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:45,050
So he has a, he, I think he has
three or four locations now and the,

419
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,350
the most crowded class have is 5:00 AM
5:00 AM what people would want to get fit

420
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:54,430
before they go to work I guess.
Yeah. Oh fuck man. You know,

421
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,550
if you get used to doing that.

422
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:57,140
I've been doing that over
the last couple of months.

423
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,420
I get up in the morning and
first thing I'd do is work out.

424
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:02,330
I'd never used to do that.
I used to eat breakfast and lay around,

425
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,700
but now I force myself to workout
first thing in the morning.

426
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,540
It makes a whole day a
different experience.

427
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,030
He gets out of the way to get that in
there. How much you trained in these days?

428
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:16,190
Not much. When I go there, I
try to do bootcamp. Um, I met,

429
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:20,030
I met, sure. Kiya and all them one, I
was doing bracelets like 12 hours a day.

430
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,710
So I don't want to go to boot Kevin and
get a little tired in the day and have

431
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,010
to be working. These bracelets that you,
or one that you're wearing right now,

432
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,500
these are, you sent me some and I gave
them to my daughters. They love him.

433
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,950
Right. Um, what, what is the significance
behind these bracelets? Well,

434
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,440
in Japan they believed that the
bracelets protect you. Yeah.

435
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,180
So if a brace it breaks,

436
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,060
it's actually a good thing because it's
taking something that was supposed to

437
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:44,894
come to you.

438
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,980
And that's the real main reason why I
started wearing them and was interested in

439
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,120
him. And later on down the line
someone told me, Oh, you know, they're,

440
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,370
you know that there's parcels,
there are real gems. And I'm like,

441
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,820
what do you mean there's crystals?
I know Crystal's, okay, cool.

442
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,280
But what did you mean whether gems?
And they told me,

443
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:05,030
you know what the r next to have the
citrine and it's all different properties

444
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:09,830
for different things. And
I'm like, really? And it's
crazy because, um, you know,

445
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:12,560
there's, there's one for every
ailment, there's one for depression,

446
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:17,030
there's one for diabetes, you
know, and, and for me, I, I made,

447
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,670
I make the braces. I'm not a stone expert.
Right. And I love the bracelets tonight.

448
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,910
When I started making them for color, I
realized I was choosing different stones.

449
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,520
And then we started reading up on that.

450
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,720
And now it's like sometimes you get
people coming in to make a bracelet for

451
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:36,110
arthritis.
And I'm the one making the braces,

452
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:39,740
but I'm not a stone expert and I'm not
this glue that's pushing power stones.

453
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,700
I'm pushing bracelets and it
just happens to be parcels.

454
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,190
And so they want to line up for

455
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,500
arthritis. So I get all my,
you know, a little book and
Ocu arthritis stones. Okay.

456
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,350
Calcite.
I line up the calcite,

457
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,310
get a good look at and something nice
and something that's for their ailment.

458
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,510
And two days later, and this happened
numerous times, they'll walk in and see,

459
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:00,420
you know, my hands aren't tight
when I wake up in the morning.

460
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,430
Do you believe that though? Yes. See the
thing is I'm supposed to be like, well,

461
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:09,090
I'm supposed to be like, yeah, I know,
but then for me, it's still new to me,

462
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,380
so I'm like, no way. Really.

463
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,590
I'm super skeptical at this 0.5 because
I've just seen so much bullshit,

464
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,720
but I think that if you
tell someone that a a,

465
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:24,120
a rock can help some part of their
life, then it actually can. Yeah.

466
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,240
The placebo effect is real
and I don't understand it,

467
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,980
but you can give people sugar pills and
tell them that it's medicine and their

468
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:36,981
body thinking that it's medicine starts
to relax and concentrate on here,

469
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,780
Huh. Yeah. A lot of it
is just people were,

470
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,090
I think there's a lot of ailments that
fall upon people because of stress and

471
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:49,650
because they're imbalanced and they
can be somewhat alleviated by placebos.

472
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,230
We just don't understand
how the mind works. What,

473
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,100
what frequency are you tuning into when
you're taking in a placebo that you

474
00:27:56,101 --> 00:28:00,360
think is medicine that allows you to get
better? We don't know. We have no idea,

475
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,720
but we do know that it's a real fat. Yeah,
it does. Yeah. It's pretty cool, Huh?

476
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,500
So that's probably what it is. I don't
think that a rock can cure diabetes,

477
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:10,080
but what the fuck do I know?
I don't know.

478
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,680
You know the works and then it
might be that placebo thing. Yeah,

479
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:17,700
it's gotta be whatever it is,
man. It's working. I think.

480
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,000
What do you remember when everybody was
wearing those Hologram risk bracelets?

481
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,950
Those rubber ones, like a lot of athletes
are wearing them. Balanced ones. Yeah,

482
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,020
they got sued for like a hundred
million bucks and it's all bullshit.

483
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:32,580
It's 100% bullshit. But I swear to God,
people were telling me that it worked.

484
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:36,600
Like, like real athletes like Shane
Carwyn, Shane Carlton was telling me,

485
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:37,231
he's like,
dude,

486
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:41,130
I'm telling you I put this thing on
and it changed my life and I was like,

487
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,310
it's up to Siebel must via 100% it's 100%

488
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,980
but placebo somehow it's real.

489
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,950
It's like there's this dude that I know
who's a chiropractor who does it shit

490
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:56,790
called zone healing and it's a weird shit.

491
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:00,660
Like they're like they press down and
certain parts of your back and claims it

492
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:04,110
can help. The digestion and help
all sorts of areas of your body.

493
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,560
But when you press him about it, like
how's this stuff work? How's it work?

494
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,120
It's essentially he's providing you
have an avenue for the placebo effect to

495
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:16,050
work. Like by telling you that this
is helping you in certain areas,

496
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,230
it actually can help people in certain
areas. So you've got to believe it. Yeah.

497
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,650
But if you're smart enough, you know it's
bullshit and then you can't believe it.

498
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,580
So you're robbed of the placebo
effect by being too smart. Yeah,

499
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,870
it's fucked. It's weird. Right?

500
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,710
It's almost like you can be too smart
for your own good. Yeah. Something that,

501
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,300
that situation is not good to be
two sworn though. In that situation,

502
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,070
what is like,
like I had a conversation with

503
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,250
someone once and when it came to
religion and fighting and they were like,

504
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,820
why do so many fights at why so many
fighters religious? And I said, well,

505
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:52,810
it's probably the same reason why so many
like people at war religious, you know,

506
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,690
there's an old expression,
there's no atheists in a foxhole.

507
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,840
It's like when you need
to believe in something,

508
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,020
a lot of times people fall on religion
and that it can help like this.

509
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:09,391
People that have a real true belief in
God and that true belief in God does

510
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,670
benefit them substantially.

511
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:17,671
It's real that what the effect of that
belief is real and it doesn't necessarily

512
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,100
mean that what they believe in is real,

513
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:25,690
but the fact that they believe in it and
they give themselves to it can actually

514
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:30,340
benefit them. So it becomes real.
Yeah, it does. No, it does. Yeah.

515
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:31,840
I've seen people like that where you know

516
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,220
it's God's will and they accept
things easier because of that. Yeah,

517
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,310
it's actually beneficial
for a lot of people.

518
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,400
It's very beneficial and
in a sense sometimes being
an atheist or being someone

519
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:47,710
who doubts everything can kind of fuck you

520
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,860
because I've always said that
like I wished that someone
could come along with a

521
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:57,820
cult that I truly believed in. Like
something has a really good, really well,

522
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:01,720
like I just not think about all this shit.
You guys got it all explained out.

523
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,560
Oh right, good. And just d, Let me
look at it a little bit. All right.

524
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:08,290
It seems like you've got
your bases covered now.

525
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:10,690
I don't have to think about these
things. Well this is what is, uh,

526
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,490
being a atheist can screw you. You know,
it's being too religious can also too,

527
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,820
yeah.
Well it's,

528
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,280
especially if you're too religious
in like a hypocritical sort of a way,

529
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,870
which is a lot of times people,

530
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:27,370
they pick and choose what they believe
and when it comes to religion, you know,

531
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:31,630
this is a lot of Christians that are
like angry people and they know the angry

532
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:33,370
about people that are non Christians,

533
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:38,371
are angry about people that don't follow
aspects of the Bible that they believe

534
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:42,100
in and it gets, uh, it
gets kind of squirrely.

535
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,460
But the near the nature of it, I think
all, I think the nature of all religions,

536
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:53,230
the best aspects of all religions and
aren't tainted by man are the lessons that

537
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:58,231
people learn over a life of trial and
error and wisdom and sharing ideas.

538
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,460
And he kind of learned that to be a
good person you have to do good things.

539
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,160
And to be a happy person,
you have to help others.

540
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:10,030
And you know when you treat each other
like they're your brothers and sisters

541
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:13,650
out there in the world, you truly
have a better life and you live in a,

542
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,410
in a way that makes you more connected
and it makes you in their eyes more

543
00:32:17,411 --> 00:32:18,400
connected to God.

544
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,080
And in a big sense that's what you're
doing with your life these days.

545
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,870
All your work helping all
these people in Fukushima,

546
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:30,871
like you're not a guy who just kind of
like does charity because it's a public

547
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:33,370
thing and it makes you look good.

548
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:38,371
Like you feel very dedicated to these
causes and it's very admirable because you

549
00:32:38,711 --> 00:32:41,570
go out there and you risk your
health and safety. You go to the,

550
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:45,530
I've seen the photos that
you put up online, man, you
are in the fucking hot zone.

551
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,600
Yeah, we went up to three
times. Yeah. What is that
like? I probably say like this,

552
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:55,370
right? It doesn't feel like raising
nothing. You can't feel nothing.

553
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,360
You don't get hot, you don't
feel itchy. There's nothing man.

554
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,670
The radiation's a scary thing man.

555
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,590
And all you see is the guy
you're or growing up on the couch

556
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,280
just scares you just so watching
that thing go up. Yeah. How,

557
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,430
what is like a normal
radiation level? Um, well,

558
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,540
well when I went into Shima the most
high God and the one time was a 25,000

559
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:23,611
microsieverts so as far as if you to to
put into relation 65,000 microsieverts

560
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,110
within a year we'll change your
blood chemistry. Whoa. Yeah.

561
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:33,820
So I got 25,000. I think I got a
little more after that, but nothing,

562
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,660
I kind of stopped at about halfway.
So he says he safe.

563
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,380
They say that you're supposed
to take iodine, iodine tablets.

564
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,440
What does I die on? Tavis helps to, um,
contracted, but it's mostly for the Tyro,

565
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,570
thyroid cancer, which is one
of the most common cancers. Oh,

566
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,220
so it just works on a tie. Well, yeah.

567
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,440
And there's all kinds of stuff they
said we eat, see lead, you know,

568
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:58,290
seaweeds go see we strong and I are done.

569
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,000
I asked to see lead
helps with the radiation.

570
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:04,460
What if you get seaweed
that's contaminated with
radiation? One of mine. Got It.

571
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,100
You're fucked. Yeah. Yeah.
They said that they've,

572
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,720
they've started catching tuna that show
a 3% increase in radiation and everybody

573
00:34:12,721 --> 00:34:16,620
started freaking out. But they say that
that's still negligible still there.

574
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,070
No. The thing that I always wonder
know is since cause she was,

575
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,220
everyone's been testing everything though.
I don't,

576
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,980
have they been doing that before?
Have you caught before she,

577
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,120
their car like tuna and
tested for radiation? I don't
think they've done that.

578
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:30,620
You know,

579
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,860
I think they probably must have
otherwise he wouldn't have a base level.

580
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,610
Oh, I can pay this. The
grace. Oh, I see. I see.

581
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,750
I read a thing recently about grand
central station in New York City is

582
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:45,830
radioactive because it's made
out of granite and granite is,

583
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:49,100
it has natural radioactive properties.
So in actuality,

584
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:53,150
when you walk them through Grand Central
Station is more radioactive than is

585
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,470
required, uh, for a nuclear
power plant to be below,

586
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,740
like nuclear power plants have,
like when you're working at a power plant,

587
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,420
it has to be below a
certain amount of radiation.

588
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,250
Grand Central Station is higher than
that just because of natural granite.

589
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:10,270
It's fucking crazy. That's the people to
understand. There's radiation all over.

590
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:10,900
Yeah.

591
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,290
Like once on antifreeze Shayma when the
winds were blowing the right direction

592
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:18,460
from me, I got 16. Microsieverts
I fall, I fall on the plane,

593
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:23,290
went round trip to um, New York. I
got 19. I had the same guard kroner.

594
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,020
So it's like you write in their plane,
you're getting,

595
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,080
you're getting a mediation to the CMN
outside going to the car and radiation

596
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,300
bouncing off the concrete
and you get radiation.

597
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,060
You're getting reation we're getting
reached right now from, I'm freaking out.

598
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,913
Computers.

599
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,210
Yeah. Well that's what they
say about cell phones. Right?

600
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,490
Like that they're going to see a bunch
of people that have brain tumors later on

601
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:46,590
because they're holding phones
up to their ears all the time.

602
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,620
So it's something that's
really misunderstood right now.

603
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,350
The plane thing is a
big one. Yeah, please.

604
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,840
That's why I think it's higher risk yet.
It'd be a flight attendant.

605
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:58,260
A lot of flight attendants can work
too long. Yeah. Yeah. It's, um,

606
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,460
it's like getting,

607
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,980
apparently a round trip flight is
like getting a bunch of x rays. Yeah.

608
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,630
Chest x rays.
We talked about it before.

609
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:10,560
I tried to figure out what the actual
number was, but when you get an x ray,

610
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:11,520
when you go to the dentist,

611
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,780
that chick hits that button from behind
a fucking concrete blast barrier.

612
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,200
You know,
they cover,

613
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,740
you would lead and then they run out of
the room and hit that button and then

614
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:23,574
come back in.

615
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,790
But meanwhile you're getting that same
kind of exposure every time you get on a

616
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:30,630
flight. Fly to London, fly
as you can. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,770
But flight attendants, I don't hear about
them getting sick all the time. Well,

618
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:38,190
my friend had a flight. It didn't told
me there's a lot of them think of cancer.

619
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,540
What kind of cancer? I Dunno.
Yeah. I wonder if there's some,

620
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,560
like if the iodine thing
protects you from thyroid cancer,

621
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,530
if there's other shit that protects
you from other cancers, it probably is,

622
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:52,620
but we don't know about it yet.
It's probably antioxidants, green,

623
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:55,920
leafy vegetables, things like
that. I mean, isn't that,

624
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:00,030
but I don't truly totally
understand the process of evolution,

625
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,170
but from what I understand,

626
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:05,840
a lot of it is from random mutations
that are caused by radiation. Like yeah.

627
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,900
Random mutations that
prove to be advantageous.

628
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:14,650
Those are the ones that are capped, you
know, she's just getting off a plane. Oh,

629
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,100
maybe that's why I'm so stupid today.
That's why I can't talk so good. Yeah,

630
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,620
there's certain days you wonder. Yeah. Um,

631
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,600
but rocks granted like a lot of
different things just give off natural

632
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:31,920
radiation. Yeah. What are
they going to do? Um, to,

633
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,900
to try to contain that area
there? They have a long term. No,

634
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:41,200
there's a, um, I have a friend that
she went to a tech sheet trying to,

635
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:46,080
he has a machine that will actually melt
down radiation off glass, out of water.

636
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,060
And it's in the testing stage right now,
almost in a final testing seats.

637
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:54,420
So if that getting that kind of get
accepted, it's going to be a big thing.

638
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,040
It can melt down Riyadh.

639
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,350
The heat goes so high that it
can melt down militate though.

640
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,260
Off Water. Off Glass. Whoa. Yeah,

641
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:08,190
it's so it's takes glass that's
radioactive and it melted down.

642
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,620
But where's the radiation go?
And he goes, yeah, I know.

643
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,300
I don't need to have this conversation.
Even the,

644
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,020
even like the problem is she wants
to like the call Shit. Oh yeah.

645
00:38:16,021 --> 00:38:20,370
He said they have tons of that and that
it can melt that down and then it turns

646
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:25,080
it into like dry wall so he could actually
use the cow shit is radioactive. Yeah.

647
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:26,130
This is great.
As it cost you,

648
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:27,900
they have tons of and didn't
know what to do with it.

649
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,070
It's the fine radioactive cow shit
that you could turn it into dry wall.

650
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,220
Wow. People are weird. What a weird world

651
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,010
we live in. Yeah. I know.
There was some kid who, um,

652
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,070
I had figured out some sort of a way to
take radioactive waste and to reprocess

653
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:49,780
it and turn it into fuel again. Wow.
Yeah. Because most radioactive waste,

654
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,970
you know,
they have to store it in the ground.

655
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:55,120
Like there's places in Nevada where
they have these, did you see Godzilla?

656
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,980
The new Godzilla? No, I didn't.
It is. Okay. It's kind of stupid.

657
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:04,180
But what one of the things is the monsters
go after the radioactive waste that's

658
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:07,140
stored in near Las Vegas.
Like way out deep in the desert.

659
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,730
Apparently they have these,
these vaults where they,

660
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,600
they take radioactive waste from nuclear
power plants and they bury it deep into

661
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,700
the ground. The monsters went after
that cause they eat radiation. Oh Wow.

662
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,870
Pretty fucking it. Yeah. But this
kid who is invented this, uh,

663
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,400
this process believes that in the future
that they'll be able to take all of

664
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:31,150
this radioactive quote unquote
waste and that it's not waste.

665
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,850
It's just that they don't completely
understand the process of converting it

666
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:36,520
back to fuel yet.
But once that process is understood,

667
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,910
there will be no
radioactive waste anymore.

668
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,670
There'll be able to convert
that back to fuel. Wow. Yeah.
Pretty interesting. Right?

669
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:45,010
Yeah.
Crazy shit going on that.

670
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,730
Well that's an interesting thing about
when we fuck up because when human beings

671
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:52,210
fucked up, we fucked up so many
different things. But when we fuck up,

672
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:56,230
our backs get pushed against the wall
and then we're forced to innovate like a,

673
00:39:56,231 --> 00:40:00,550
there's a 19 year old kid and figured
out a machine that can take the plastic

674
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,850
out of that Pacific garbage patch.
You know about that garbage patch?

675
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:07,360
It's in the ocean, you know about all
of that? No. Oh that's a crazy thing.

676
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,390
There's an area in the ocean,
enormous area,

677
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:15,100
this bigger than the size of Texas
that is all plastic from the world,

678
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:16,840
from all over the countries of the world.

679
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,240
People that have littered things
that have fallen off of boats,

680
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:23,860
things that have got picked up from
the beach. And they've all swirled,

681
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,000
cause you know,
there's um,

682
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,300
there's currents in the ocean and
his currents create pass and inside,

683
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,181
yeah.

684
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:36,100
Inside these paths in these areas where
all this stuff has sort of congealed and

685
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,710
congested, um, that those
aren't the right words.

686
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,890
But it's formed this like floating patch
of garbage and it's really fucked up

687
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:48,970
because it's in the Wa there's, there's
an image of it, but they've, um,

688
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,060
they've done all these missions to go
out and try to figure out how big exactly

689
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:59,350
is. The problem is a lot of
it is suspended underneath
the water and it's being

690
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:03,430
broken down slowly by the water. So
fish are eating it, ingesting it,

691
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:04,091
and getting sick.

692
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:08,290
Birds are taking the plastic back
and feeding it to their children,

693
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,370
to their babies because the birds don't
understand what the fuck it is. So they,

694
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:14,260
there's islands that they
find where these birds,

695
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:19,060
these baby birds are dead and their
stomachs are filled with plastic bits that

696
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:22,210
their mothers have given them because
their mothers don't know what the fuck

697
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:26,010
they are. Their mothers think that it's
fish or food or something like that. Wow.

698
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,850
Yeah, it's pretty crazy. So this kid has
figured out a way to take this gigantic,

699
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,790
see this machine, it's skims the, uh, the,

700
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:37,400
the ocean and it's going to suck all
the plastic out of the ocean and cleaned

701
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:41,090
the whole thing. Whoa. Yeah.
Incredible. Your kid. Yeah.

702
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,430
And then they've also said,
well, you know, hey, you know,

703
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:45,980
we're going to all these
problems with the ocean and the,

704
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,030
there's these dead zones is lack of
oxygen and pollution in the ocean.

705
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:55,220
They figured out a way to throw iron
to take iron scrap and poured into the

706
00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:00,180
ocean and that iron scrap, we'll
create algae and create, uh,

707
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,690
different, uh, environments
for fish to live in.

708
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,780
And it'll re oxygenate
the water while yes,

709
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:09,380
it's weird like when people get their back
pushed up again, the, on both of those,

710
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,220
I don't even,

711
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,640
I shouldn't even be allowed to talk
about it too fucking stupid to explain it

712
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:17,540
correctly, but it's, it's
fascinating. There's this kid event,

713
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:22,250
this a giant ocean garbage patch skimmer
and that's this machine that he's,

714
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,850
he's invented and I believe
he's only 19 too, but in,

715
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,150
within a few years time,
he did a Ted talk on it.

716
00:42:29,151 --> 00:42:31,820
Within a few years time they're going to
be able to clean up that patch if this

717
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:36,470
invention, uh, pants out. Yeah.
That's the weird thing about people.

718
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,020
We fuck everything up,
but when we fuck everything up,

719
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:43,940
someone smarter comes along,
goes, okay. Okay. Okay. That's
amazing. That's amazing.

720
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,970
That's amazing. Well, we were doing right
and a lot of labor. Wasn't that like us,

721
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:51,830
man, you still primitive days,
man. Cave man days yet. Well,

722
00:42:51,831 --> 00:42:55,220
I'm glad there's people like
us too though. You know?
That's the Yin and the Yang,

723
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:58,940
right? That's the great, the great
balance of life can all be eggheads.

724
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,090
There has to be all sorts of different
people to make this world so interesting.

725
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,570
But yeah, if it was just up to you and
me, I don't think there'd be an internet.

726
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,400
We wouldn't really be having a podcast.

727
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,250
We wouldn't be taught through
the fuck knows how this works.

728
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,690
How's this microphone work? I
have no clue. I rely on these.

729
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,660
I have no idea how they were true.
I don't have a clue.

730
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,690
I couldn't even draw you a fucking like
a crude schematic of what's inside of a

731
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:27,330
microphone, you know? But it's
important. Yeah, the knee.

732
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,390
That's the beauty of being human is that
we all sort of contribute in one sort

733
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:32,870
of a way.

734
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,870
We're all like one piece of a gigantic
organism that's kind of doing all these

735
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:41,600
things and occasionally part of
the organism fucks up like, ah,

736
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:43,640
we didn't have a backup
on a power plant shit.

737
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:48,320
And then the world has to sort of scramble
and right now I'm sure there's people

738
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:50,420
far more intelligent than you or I,

739
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:54,910
and they're trying to figure out a way
to fix things like Fukushima. Yeah,

740
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,670
I bet there's a lot of
them. We got to, yeah,

741
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,060
that thing that they're doing with
the w the ice is pretty crazy.

742
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,150
These giant pipes in the
ground and they're trying
to freeze the ground to turn

743
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:12,140
it into a giant containment wall,
like a big pot, like a big pool.

744
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:16,760
Huge swimming pool filled with
radioactive waste in real fucked.

745
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,780
I mean, isn't there a better way
to do it? It sounds so ridiculous.

746
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,830
It sounds like something a
little Kibin advent, you know,

747
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,340
but I don't think there is.
What is the government of Japan?

748
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:31,820
Did they have a financial problem right
now? I don't know man. But they're not,

749
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:31,980
you're

750
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,640
just not reimbursing the people. They're
not helping the people. You know,

751
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,253
like if you,

752
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:42,950
if you're going to take a land and
a house away from a family who's,

753
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,380
who's worked hard for it to
work for it all their lives,

754
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,620
because a company that's run by the
government, which is Tepco, the,

755
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:53,930
the nuclear plant is run by
the government. If you're,

756
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,650
your client is going to fuck up,

757
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,740
you're going to take responsibility
and relocate them to an equal amount of

758
00:45:01,591 --> 00:45:04,170
things that they had.
Instead of putting them in a little box,

759
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,100
how much money would that cost?
How many Neil? 100,000 of them.

760
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,920
So that's why they can afford it.
Over a hundred.

761
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,890
100,000 and you'd have to spend at least
a hundred thousand probably on each one

762
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:19,660
of them do. Yeah. Well a lot of them
were helped out by Red Cross. Oh yeah.

763
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:24,180
Yeah. So I don't think government's
doing, yeah. Fuck. Well,

764
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,100
you figured the government didn't tell
the people what was really happening with

765
00:45:27,101 --> 00:45:28,570
the radiation?
Well,

766
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:32,530
that was one of the few times I think
that I can recall where I talked to,

767
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:37,180
you know, Japanese people are
very orderly and very polite.

768
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,570
It's a very different society.
When I was in Japan,

769
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,980
what was fascinating because it was
only about a year after the Fukushima

770
00:45:44,981 --> 00:45:47,980
incident and I was talking
to this guy and uh,

771
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,030
he was very reluctant to talk
negatively about the government,

772
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,440
but he was trying to hedge his
words and basically said was,

773
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,740
I don't think they've been
entirely honest. That was like,

774
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:03,890
that's the worst he could have said yes.
He didn't want to say like different,

775
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:07,780
the Japanese culture,
like for Americans who are,

776
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:11,060
everybody in America wants a
pill to lose weight. You know,

777
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,760
they want a quick fix for everything.

778
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,210
I don't think they totally
understand the Japanese culture.

779
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,830
That's why like a doc. Did you see the
documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi? No.

780
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,530
It's fascinating,
fascinating documentary.

781
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:28,531
It's about this guy who has a small Sushi
place in a Tokyo subway and this small

782
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:35,161
Sushi place he's been working at for
decades and he works 16 hours a day,

783
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,890
every day and we'll work
like for years and years,

784
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:43,120
just develop this one dish and has all
these apprentices and that this one

785
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:46,840
apprentice, they thought I was working
for years on this particular egg dish.

786
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,020
And then finally he got it right and
the guy said, you got it right finally.

787
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:55,110
And the guy was crying cause
it some fucking egg dish.
Whoa. Some egg dishes. It's,

788
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,530
this is a, that's Jiro. It's
an interesting documentary.

789
00:46:59,531 --> 00:47:03,310
Apparently has the best Sushi in uh,
in Japan is incredible.

790
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:08,110
The delicious Sushi and it's like a 10
seat restaurant. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

791
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:12,310
And before the documentary came out,
it was booked for months in advance.

792
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:14,430
But now that documentaries
out who knows me,

793
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,290
it might be impossible
to get in there earlier,

794
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,280
but because of the fact that he keeps
the place so small and he doesn't have

795
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,400
that many people working
for him, like he, his,

796
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,770
he's not really concerned with branching
out like you've used an American,

797
00:47:26,771 --> 00:47:29,710
they were like, we're going to sell
our brand, our businesses, our brand.

798
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,010
And what we're

799
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,800
going to do now is going to spread
out of the malls all across America.

800
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,470
Jiro dreams of Sushi stores.
Nope,

801
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,970
this cat has one place and he's humble.
He's hardworking.

802
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500
He's fucking 80 years old.

803
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:44,440
He had a quit smoking cigarettes cause
he had a heart attack, but you know,

804
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:47,740
healed back up, stop smoking
cigarettes, jumped right back in.

805
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,270
Still working 16 hours a day. Wow,
that's neat. And I should check that out.

806
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:57,220
It's, it's admirable. Right. But
isn't that, that's the Sushi place.

807
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,300
Tiny little place man.

808
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,860
But isn't that sort of indicative about
the differences between Japanese culture

809
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,630
and Americans? A lot of differences. Yeah.

810
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,820
Extreme differences in the way of thinking
in the way of doing things. Yeah. Well,

811
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,860
that's where you,
you know,

812
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,180
you are known for not just being,
uh,

813
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,070
one of the pioneers of MMA,

814
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,100
but you're known for that expression
Yamato [inaudible] that you have always,

815
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,420
you've always promoted that ideal,
this,

816
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:33,140
this Samurai spirit and this,
this spirit of Japan, this way of,

817
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,940
of doing things wholeheartedly.
And you know,

818
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:41,320
you've talked openly that
you freely give yourself,

819
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:44,530
like when you would go to fight
and you'd be ready to die. Yes.

820
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,900
And not just saying that like you, you
would really reconciled it in your mind.

821
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,260
You would say goodbye to your friends.
Say Goodbye to your family

822
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:53,923
letters.

823
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,530
I wrote letters to people that I
wanted to say goodbye to every fight.

824
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:02,940
Yeah. That's some deep shit. You
know, it was the thing too is I'm

825
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,780
fighting to die flying to die.

826
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:10,750
You're going to train
with the will to die too,

827
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,680
so you can measure them as good
training I got in. Yeah. I mean,

828
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,210
I'm training every day before the fight,

829
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:22,960
so I won't die in the fight.
I'm planning, I'm okay.

830
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,510
I'm accepting the fact
that I might die there,

831
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,790
but I know that the better I can be is
the less chance to me dying in the ring.

832
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,141
So you know,

833
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:34,870
I'm not going to get up in the morning
and because I'm sore I'm not going to

834
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:39,871
miss training because I'm tired or
I'm lazy because it'll might be the

835
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,620
difference in me living and
dying in the room. So you know,

836
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:48,130
it helped me out a lot. And then the
training aspect and you know the dining,

837
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:49,990
I mean I want to eat,
I want to drink a coke,

838
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,840
but I'm trying to eat only good things
on my before my fight. And it's,

839
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,660
it's a lot easier to do that when you're
in to that level. It can't hurt you,

840
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,630
you know,
to plan to die in the ring to,

841
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:05,230
to believe that and to train and to walk
that life for that three months while

842
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:07,000
training for the fight it,
they can't hurt you.

843
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,980
Is it difficult for you because you
earnestly embraced that thought process?

844
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:18,420
Is it difficult for you when you see
guys that are kind of dabbling in MMA,

845
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,780
that kind of like half asking it,
not training hard enough.

846
00:50:21,781 --> 00:50:22,950
Maybe they have some talent,

847
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,980
but they don't really put their
will and heart into it. Well,

848
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,070
it's a whole new era now because

849
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,520
back in the day we didn't get
paid good. We weren't, we weren't,

850
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,570
weren't that worried about, you
know, losing a sponsor here, right.

851
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,070
Being cut by the UFC,
you know,

852
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:40,840
that kind of stuff didn't because there
was all these little association with

853
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,110
fighting for so little bit money.

854
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,180
The objective and the whole movement
of that error was different. Yeah.

855
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:49,640
So you know,
when fighters start getting lazy

856
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:55,370
or they don't fight as hard or the
tap out a little sooner, you know,

857
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:58,550
I understand that because it's a whole
new era because you're fighting for a

858
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:02,030
different reason though. They're fighting
for money, they're fighting for living,

859
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,280
they're fighting for sponsors if
wanting to look good. You know?

860
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,700
So it's easier when you're
fighting for those reasons.

861
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,420
I mean there's only so much
money will make you do,

862
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,440
but if you're fighting for your honor
and you're fighting for your life,

863
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,970
it's a whole different level.
Yeah,

864
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,990
it's interesting too because in this day
and age it's a real business as well.

865
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:25,890
So it's almost like you have to have a
little bit of both to be the elite of the

866
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:30,390
elite, you almost have to have the
attitude that you had, but in order to be,

867
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,650
to maximize your profits, you have to
kind of think about it in a different way.

868
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:39,330
And after like avoid certain fights
or pick and choose your opponents,

869
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,640
but then once you have
an opponent locked in,

870
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,910
it's almost like the best of both
worlds seems to be like the answer.

871
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,780
Well I think, yeah,
you have to have a good

872
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:52,720
balance here because if you just look a
fighter like me wouldn't make it today.

873
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,420
I mean I probably wouldn't
have that much wins.

874
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,290
I probably would have three with losses
in a role and I'd probably be losing way.

875
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:04,350
My job at the UFC, you know,
there's, it's, it's when
people ask me a lot, you know,

876
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,770
are you disappointed at the, wait,
what happened to the fight game?

877
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,350
And they, they, you know,
I always say, you know,

878
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,060
a lot of times now in the fight game
where the worrier we'll start is where the

879
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:21,040
fight ends now. I mean, right where his
heart is going to kick in right now. Okay.

880
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:21,620
This is

881
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,020
wanna see if this guy has
it in his heart or not.

882
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:27,080
That's when the ref stops the fight
because it's getting dangerous, you know?

883
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,380
Did you see, um, this past
weekend's fights? Yeah, I did.

884
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:33,650
Did you see Jason High and
Rafael dos Anjos yeah. Did you,

885
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,150
what'd you think about that, that
situation? Do you know what happened?

886
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:38,690
He pushed the right, that should
never happen. Never happened.

887
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:41,420
It should never happen. If you
don't know what happened. Um,

888
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:46,000
Dosantos cracked Jason High, hit him
with a real good shot, had them down.

889
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:50,120
I thought it was a premature stoppage.
He was, he was getting hit, but he was,

890
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,980
he was moving into position,

891
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,970
but Dosantos did that thing that guys
do where they look at the referee,

892
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:56,931
the hitting them,

893
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:58,850
and then they look at the referee there
aren't you gonna stop that and then the

894
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,140
referee comes in and stops that,

895
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,400
which is kind of fucking manipulative
that guys do that all the time.

896
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,020
This was hard about the refereeing job
is split second can change a good stop.

897
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:07,920
It's too shitty softening.

898
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,560
And if he stopped at like a second earlier
when I'd read Jason High got dropped

899
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,350
and it was kind of a little bit out of it.
After the flurry,

900
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,450
it would have been a good stoppage.
But he waited and Jason,

901
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:21,830
I actually got his posture and
I started like coming up again.

902
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,740
It was a little premature.

903
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,040
But do you think that it's better
to be premature than it is to be,

904
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,170
to have guys take too many shots?

905
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,700
Like what are you thoughts on that
in the day today? Today's MMA? Yes,

906
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,950
definitely. Today's I'm going
to stop the fights her. Yeah.

907
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:39,420
You got to kind of let
the guys getting hurt.

908
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,020
But the MMA of your era pride was such
a completely different animal because

909
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:49,330
there was stomps and
soccer kicks and there was,

910
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,630
the rule system was completely different.

911
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,240
It was just a completely
different kind of finds.

912
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:56,610
Any pins and you're fighting for you
right now in the UFC. It's a sport,

913
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,990
it's a sport, it's a, it's a huge
sport now you can get sponsored,

914
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:04,870
you can make a living with it. It's
huge. You're fighting for a sport and to,

915
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:07,890
to be a huge sport as you need
immediate need to sponsors.

916
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:11,430
You can't have guys getting hurt. You
can't make it too brutal, you know?

917
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:16,431
So in this day and age you should be more
cautious than anything in stopping the

918
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:20,190
face. I grew with that. But back in the
day when you're fighting for honor, no,

919
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:25,380
I mean if that fight was not televised
and you don't need to worry about

920
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:30,210
sponsors and you know, and people getting
hurt and suits and everything, I would,

921
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,830
if I, in my day I would prefer the
fight not to have stoppages. Well,

922
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,480
like perfect example in my opinion is
Frankie Edgar and like Frankie Edgar and

923
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:44,481
gray Maynard lot of referees would've
stopped to have those fights in the first

924
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:49,230
round. A lot of referees. But
Frankie Edgar came back to uh,

925
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:53,190
to have a draw and one of those fights
where it looked like gray Maynard had him.

926
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,370
Yeah, he was solid. I
mean, it was ridiculous.

927
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,620
A lot of people would have stopped
that fight and waved it off.

928
00:54:58,621 --> 00:55:02,440
But Frankie Edgar came back to win the
second round and then start winning

929
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,520
enough, you know, rounds and make
it close enough. So that was a draw.

930
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,060
And then the second fight or
the fight after that same thing,

931
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,720
he gets tagged and hurt real bad and the
first round and then came back to knock

932
00:55:12,721 --> 00:55:16,420
gray Maynard out later in the fight.
It's, it's hard. It's, it's uh,

933
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:20,220
in everybody's different. Some guys
can take a shot, some guys just can't,

934
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,600
some guys get hurt and they never come
back. Some guys are known for coming back.

935
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,760
The thing I think about that is, you know,
if the stuff is just weren't so soon,

936
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:32,250
you know how many unbelievable
inspirational moments
we'd have in fighting.

937
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:36,990
But that's a sacrifice we make four
for it to be such a big sport. No.

938
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,470
Yeah, the butt part. It's
a big, big part. Yeah.

939
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,650
It's a weird thing because there's no
absolute correct moment in a fight to call

940
00:55:46,771 --> 00:55:50,520
a fight. Like one person's call,
like the guys had a punishment.

941
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,930
Another referee may disagree.
It's so subjective. Yeah. Ice.

942
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,220
It's a real hard thing. If I'm
like, you know, it's, I mean,

943
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:01,650
I wouldn't say I could be the
same fighter if I fought today.

944
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,300
Now when you say that,

945
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,670
like when you say that you would
have three losses in a row,

946
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,960
like what would be the difference between
the way you fought and the way like

947
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:14,430
say, modern MMA fighters
fight? I'm, for me,

948
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,440
the win isn't getting my hand raised.
Yeah.

949
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,520
The wind is hitting the fears that I
have head on and growing as a person.

950
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,160
If I, it's, it's really,

951
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,890
sometimes it really contracts each
other because for Igor, Volvo Chante,

952
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:32,501
when I fought him,

953
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:36,040
the best thing for me to do was
to take him down and get on top.

954
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,900
But the best thing for me to,
to grow as a man,

955
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:45,760
as a person is to hit that fearful
stage of throwing total total it, Igor.

956
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,840
You know what I mean?

957
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,600
Ego Of,
of [inaudible] for folks who don't know,

958
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,960
when you were finding him was one of the
most devastating strikers in the sport

959
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,040
at the time. He was brutal knockout
artists and he was a small guy,

960
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:01,460
but he fucked up Mark Kerr
when Mark Carr was big,

961
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:05,360
he remember he caught Mark Harwood Harwell
bomb standing up and me ego was only

962
00:57:05,361 --> 00:57:07,240
like five, 10 right. It wasn't a, yeah,

963
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,290
he looked like a guy that should have
probably been way bigger and longer,

964
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,050
but someone like chopped
his arms off at the end,

965
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:19,190
not for fists,
like in the middle of his,

966
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,990
and he was just this ball of muscle
and bone. That guy could crack.

967
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,240
Yeah.

968
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,240
For me to win the fight and to win the
battle in my heart to be a stronger

969
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:32,660
person.
It's two different things.

970
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:33,091
So the,

971
00:57:33,091 --> 00:57:37,090
when the fight is was to use your
Jujitsu to take him to the ground just a

972
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:41,580
minute, but to overcome your fear was to
bite down your mouthpiece and just wing.

973
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:45,750
Yes and fuck. Did you ever
man, that was some crazy shit.

974
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:49,860
I remember I was watching it at my
house with Eddie Bravo and we were just

975
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:54,300
screaming. The whole like beginning
of that fight was oh shit. Oh Shit.

976
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,380
Cause you just did exactly what,
like a coil,

977
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:01,530
like a Greg Jackson would tell you not to
do. They would say, they would say, okay,

978
00:58:01,531 --> 00:58:04,860
I want you to avoid, avoid his punches,
which is what we're going to do.

979
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:06,630
We're going to kick the legs,
we're going to move around a lot.

980
00:58:06,631 --> 00:58:08,270
When you see the opening,
we see the punches calm.

981
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:09,810
You're going to shoot
him for the take down

982
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,630
when they are bit down that
mouthpiece and you were,

983
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,740
that was one of the wildest opening
exchanges I can remember from the day.

984
00:58:19,741 --> 00:58:20,370
You know what

985
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:25,050
cirrhotic thing about that fight is?
It was my worst beating that ever took,

986
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,540
but it was the best fight for me.

987
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:31,260
I've learned so much about
myself in that fight.

988
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,320
I learned about my heart and
that actually solidified that,

989
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:41,070
you know, living the Yarmouth, Llama
wait, you know, a lot of people, you know,

990
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:44,430
you can say it, you can have
these kind of sorta hard fights,

991
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:48,330
but that fight kind of showed
that I'm actually living it.

992
00:58:48,331 --> 00:58:53,331
So it was the worst beating physically
Vic as far as getting the results as far

993
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:57,600
as the victory, that was probably
the worst fight in my career.

994
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:01,010
But as far as me growing as a
person and as far as, you know,

995
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:04,470
something that was a reputation that was
to me forever, it was the best fight.

996
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,910
Do you have a fight that like you look,

997
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,180
you look back and your member is like
a proud moment or one of your proudest

998
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:11,014
moments?

999
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,810
Oh, that fight would probably be
it, but not at the moment. Yeah,

1000
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,840
because at the moment I didn't think I
was that bad. I, uh, at the moment when,

1001
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:22,070
um, when I was getting hit, the biggest,

1002
00:59:22,071 --> 00:59:24,960
I remember getting hit some shots
that really rocked me and I,

1003
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:28,160
I remember thinking in my head,
the thing that I thought was,

1004
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,180
I can't let them know it hurt.

1005
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,430
And I remember looking at my corner
and looking at them and just saying,

1006
00:59:33,431 --> 00:59:34,850
I'm okay.
It didn't ask me,

1007
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:37,360
but I just did it on purpose because
I knew he'd be see me doing nearly,

1008
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,220
what the fuck's wrong with this
guy. Just hit him so hard. What,

1009
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,430
what blue they'll just knock people out
with and he skies look in his corner so

1010
00:59:44,431 --> 00:59:49,160
I'm okay. And then you know that that's
the kind of stuff. And I, when the,

1011
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:51,560
when the fight was stopped
and I was screaming, no,

1012
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:55,520
it wasn't because I
was trying to be tough.

1013
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,260
I just just felt in that
moment and time I felt, okay,

1014
01:00:00,261 --> 01:00:01,640
I got two minutes between Rollins,

1015
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,850
why are you coming in at 30
seconds and seeing the fights over.

1016
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:10,390
And the second thing I'm thinking too is
you guys don't know the training that I

1017
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:15,750
went through for this. This is nothing
compared to what I did every day. I said,

1018
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,780
I mean, I felt like, let me go on.

1019
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,590
And I also felt that this is the
time right here. This is the time,

1020
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:23,090
my breaking moment in.

1021
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:25,520
This is a time where I can show
myself that I can still go on.

1022
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,480
But I didn't realize that, you
know, my, my, my year was preferred.

1023
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:32,440
It's so bad that I had my
equilibrium was off on my,

1024
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,660
didn't realize that I needed, you know, I
was saying, I was saying the doctor, no,

1025
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:38,000
I still got two minutes, you know,
I'm thinking about two minutes.

1026
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,760
Don't check me now,
but I actually should have been yelling.

1027
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:44,990
I give me three months. I didn't
realize how bad it was. Yeah.

1028
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:48,300
Wow. So how long did it
take for you to recover?

1029
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:52,050
Three months to recover from that. Wow.
So I had a periphery to your drum. Um,

1030
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,100
I had a broken jaw,
broken finger,

1031
01:00:55,101 --> 01:01:00,050
and I had a swollen brain and the,
that,

1032
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,770
that was a big worry for the doctors.
Doug, the other big brewer was a kidney.

1033
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,820
The kidney levels rose
2000 times a normal person.

1034
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:11,490
The kidney levels.
Do you see what he,

1035
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,990
what the doctor explained to me was when
your muscles get any type of trauma,

1036
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,510
even if it's just one area of your body,

1037
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,080
your muscles all act together as a team
and they'll pull it off toxins that will

1038
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,910
affect your kidneys apparently.

1039
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,171
So the,

1040
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:31,930
the breakdown of the muscle tissue was
processed by the kidneys and the kidneys

1041
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:35,380
had a deal with a lot of tissues.
Sins, yeah. Tissue Trauma.

1042
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,670
And so it was a lot of types of,
something of what the kidney levels,

1043
01:01:39,671 --> 01:01:41,710
if they go too high, the
kidneys are shut down. Well,

1044
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:45,190
it's also probably the effort that you
put forth to cause it was such a crazy,

1045
01:01:45,191 --> 01:01:46,360
crazy fight. You know, that,

1046
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,780
that issue that a lot of crossfitters
have that rhabdomyolysis.

1047
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:53,260
You hear about that? No, it's a
big issue that's going on with a,

1048
01:01:53,261 --> 01:01:57,070
a lot of these crossfit competitions,
they push themselves so far,

1049
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,580
they push themselves to the
brink of your total body failure.

1050
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:04,570
And this rhabdomyolysis is very
common amongst crossfitters.

1051
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,490
I know a guy whose wife got it,
uh,

1052
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,540
from just training crossfit because they
push themselves so fucking hard that

1053
01:02:12,821 --> 01:02:15,400
they have like kidney failure,
their body starts breaking down.

1054
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,980
It's really common. I mean, anytime
when someone overtrained that's a,

1055
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,090
it's a,
it's a big issue.

1056
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:26,150
So a fight at post fight like a fight
like that and especially pull up, uh,

1057
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,550
Ego Volv changin versus Francisco
Bueno. Yeah, I saw that.

1058
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:35,430
Z. See what this guy was like back in
the day of the fight that actually got me

1059
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:38,720
intrigued to fight Igor. Yeah.
When I saw that, that, that,

1060
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,490
that devastation was like something like,
well,

1061
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,960
can you manage stepping in that zone,

1062
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:45,600
knowing that that could
happen to you at any moment.

1063
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:49,490
But standing there in that
zone, fighting that, you know,

1064
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,960
this is when I fought marker was
right after he beat up Google Dorothy.

1065
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,570
Ah, you know, so I was looking at fights

1066
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,640
to grow as a person, not to get
a win win loss record. You know,

1067
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:07,200
that's why I'm saying Encino of today
wouldn't make it right because it wasn't

1068
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:11,010
looking, it wasn't very good
from a career. You fought
some big fucking guys too,

1069
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:14,430
and you weren't like, like you fought
Randy who's a heavyweight, you know,

1070
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:18,680
and like, here's a here's ego of, of
channeling versus Francisco [inaudible].

1071
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,560
And this was Igor at his
prime. Who has guys built,
look at this. Ding, Ding, Ding.

1072
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:26,400
He caught him three times
as he out on the way down.

1073
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,740
Yeah, that was, he was out for a long
time too. Oh yeah, dude. He got flatlined.

1074
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,890
We're sitting, I was sitting ringside
and there was this, I guess a girl,

1075
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:39,000
his girlfriend.
But she was going crazy screaming man,

1076
01:03:39,001 --> 01:03:42,840
like she was.
He didn't wake up for a while,

1077
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:47,820
but that was a brutal, brutal, brutal
Kayo. And that was Igor at his very best.

1078
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:50,160
And look at this again. Look at
the way this guy's belt. I mean,

1079
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,200
he really does look like
a guy who is way bigger.

1080
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,350
Cause I had to cut off the ends
of his body. Look at us clink.

1081
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,210
And he had those crazy punches to
those casting punches he threw.

1082
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,630
He was one of the first
guys to throw like a,

1083
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:06,210
the way fate Dar was known for throwing
those punches where it's almost like

1084
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:06,431
your,

1085
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:10,740
your hand is a perpendicular with the
ground instead of a horizontal with it.

1086
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:11,520
They would throw,

1087
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,870
he would throw a lot of his punches
like this in a very unorthodox way of

1088
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,010
casting punches. Those are
the days, the glory days.

1089
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,430
When you look back,
man, and you thankfully,

1090
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,770
you know from the 1997 your
fright with Royce Alger.

1091
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:27,330
Did they have gloves on back then?

1092
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,030
That was the last CFC that
they gave us an option.

1093
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,090
So I opted to not have
gloves because they always,

1094
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,270
always want to have to try that.
Yeah. Wow. So that was the,

1095
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:39,390
you were one in the last UFC where you
didn't have to work a lot with gene was

1096
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:41,130
the last one that they made it an option.

1097
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,660
Why is it that it was a rule
that you have? So I, I feel
like I just made it. Yes.

1098
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,880
Well for a grappler too, you
know, that's a big advantage.

1099
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:53,270
So sneaky and chokes and
the way they tape the,

1100
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,850
they didn't allow you to tape the hands
and they taped it for me and it was like

1101
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,240
it cut. Like here is like just,
just pretty much the risk.

1102
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:06,060
So nothing on this at all to
protect your hand, Huh? Yeah.

1103
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,940
What do you think now about these new,

1104
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,630
like there's a lot of issues
these days with guys I pokes,

1105
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:18,160
but it wasn't a big issue back then,
which is weird to me that there was

1106
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,340
not nearly as much of an
issue in those early days.

1107
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:25,510
Like you didn't see a lot of I
pokes. Yeah. You know, and you,

1108
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:29,860
you didn't see a lot in pride and I,
Tim Kennedy was on the podcast.

1109
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:34,360
We have these pride gloves. There was a
bunch of them like the last year of Sia.

1110
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,420
Oh, there's a lot of them a lot
lately. But these pride gloves,

1111
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,100
Tim Kennedy believes are superior to
the UFC gloves because they naturally

1112
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:43,690
promote a curved fist.

1113
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,530
Whereas the UFC gloves have much
more of a straight line to them.

1114
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:53,080
Everlast has a new glove that they're
using with the Bella tour. And, um,

1115
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:56,050
it's a much more curved
fist and it's also,

1116
01:05:56,051 --> 01:06:00,780
there's more panning across the
top to, uh, to reinforce the,

1117
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,620
the metacarpals when you,
when you're hitting.

1118
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:06,280
And they apparently stopped a lot of
bone breaks because that all really,

1119
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,380
but I almost feel like the same thing
I feel like with football that like

1120
01:06:11,590 --> 01:06:15,400
everybody is concerned about
head trauma and football,

1121
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,710
but no one wants to look at,

1122
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,420
there's a lot of people who have a
now analyzed football. They say, well,

1123
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:25,270
there's the best way to stop his head.

1124
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:29,350
Trauma is probably to make people
play football with no helmets.

1125
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:31,330
Because if you play
football with no helmets,

1126
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,700
you're gonna play it totally different.
You cannot go head to head in,

1127
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:35,920
clash into each other if
you have no fucking element.

1128
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,930
And the only real way to control the
way these guys do this is to make it so

1129
01:06:40,931 --> 01:06:42,700
that it's impossible to you.
I mean,

1130
01:06:42,701 --> 01:06:45,340
they're spiking each other with
helmets on and shoulder pads and shit.

1131
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,660
They're saying if you
really want to do it,

1132
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:50,620
look at rugby and look at Australian
rules. Football, less had trauma,

1133
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:55,660
less instances of a traumatic brain
injury and they're there fighting with no

1134
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:58,780
pads.
I mean that's probably,

1135
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:02,410
and I think that might be the
way to do with MMA to man,

1136
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,680
because I get that people think that it's
brutal to punch people with no gloves

1137
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:11,950
on. But guess what? You're kicking
people with nothing on your feet.

1138
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:17,230
Your foot is way fucking stronger. You're,
he'll never gets hurt. I mean, you could,

1139
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:20,470
he'll kick someone in the face all day
and it's never going to hurt you or heal.

1140
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:25,060
I mean, I've seen people,
we'll kick people full clip,

1141
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:29,470
slamming of their face. They walk off
fine. You never see them like, ow my foot,

1142
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:33,430
you know, it doesn't hurt your foot,
your heel, you can stomp on the ground.

1143
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:36,850
You know, you can do things with your
foot. You could never do with your hands.

1144
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,520
I think they should
probably go bare knuckle.

1145
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,060
I think that might be the way the gloves
are actually just to protect the hens

1146
01:07:43,061 --> 01:07:46,390
ivy. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe stop some cuts.

1147
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,480
Elbows, elbows, cows. So it's
probably, we could have an elbow here.

1148
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,630
What do you think about that?

1149
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:57,190
Because some people think that elbows
actually stop a lot of good fights because

1150
01:07:57,191 --> 01:08:00,340
it cuts. Asking a guy who
didn't, I didn't want,

1151
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,190
I wanted growing shots allowed.
Right.

1152
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,700
I mean everything and even I ecology,
you know,

1153
01:08:05,701 --> 01:08:08,460
I really don't because I believe that the,

1154
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:11,890
see all the people that get hurt in the
eyes because you can't do it so you're

1155
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:16,280
not expecting it. If we
were professionals, I
mean your, your to to stop

1156
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,880
all the joint locks, all the different
chokes. Who'd your training to,

1157
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,710
to stop being in bad
positions. If you, if,

1158
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,880
if you're allowed to have
growing shots, you'd be, you,

1159
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:25,910
you train not to get hit in the groin.

1160
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,660
I think if you got to allow our gouges
you've got a real problem. Yeah.

1161
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,430
I mean this, I mean even, you know, biting
his only thing that I would be for you,

1162
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,730
but biting is good if you get side
control and bites him and then he would

1163
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:42,260
actually change a flight. You know
what else? Oh, biting the ear. Yeah.

1164
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:46,670
I mean, look how Holly feel reacted
to Mike Tyson. A chunk of his ear off.

1165
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:50,900
Yeah. I think I gouges or
that's a dangerous problem.

1166
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:54,260
You've got a bunch of guys like Alan
Belcher's careers in jeopardy because of

1167
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:57,160
detached retinas. Michael Bisping
had to have several eyes surgery.

1168
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,840
He's got a real problem now.
One of his eyes looked weird,

1169
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,340
like he's got the thumbing
air. My accident. Yeah. I'm
talking about grappling.

1170
01:09:04,341 --> 01:09:08,330
When you try and dice, it's hard if
the guy's going to defend from that.

1171
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:12,650
You know nick, how Yuki losses.
I was, because I believe a big,

1172
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:14,870
a big thing was you,

1173
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:17,840
you're allowing these dirty fighters to
get away with it because it's not in the

1174
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:20,490
rules. Right. So he's not
expecting it. Yeah. Right.

1175
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,880
So I figured a professional
expecting it would would,

1176
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:27,110
that would not have happened if Nikai
knew that it was in the rules. Hmm.

1177
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,590
Yeah. That was, he fought Gerard
Gardot. Yeah. That was big. Yeah.

1178
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:35,560
Big Karate Guide. That was shameful.
Yeah. That was shameful. It was, yeah.

1179
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:38,690
He lost his eye because of
that. Yeah. He's one of the few,

1180
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,380
but there's quite a few guys have had
a text. Right. And I was like, yeah,

1181
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:45,740
that's really common these days,
man. Really common. I just,

1182
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:47,510
I don't know what they could do about it.

1183
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:51,260
I almost feel like there's a way to
cover the tips of the fingers though.

1184
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:54,020
I wonder. Yeah, I wonder how much it
will affect the Groppe Linville yeah.

1185
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,670
I wonder if it's a small,
like a thin piece of like a,

1186
01:09:57,671 --> 01:10:01,670
a thin leather that it may be even enhance
the grappling because it'll give you

1187
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:05,960
more grip and when your hands are sweaty,
you know when you clamp down,

1188
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:10,010
like maybe someone's working on it right
now probably. Huh? I'm sure there is.

1189
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,040
These are the Bella tore gloves
you could see up on that thing.

1190
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,080
See the bell toward glove is on the left.

1191
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:19,430
Where's the UFC style glove is on the
right and the bell tower glove has a a

1192
01:10:19,431 --> 01:10:22,950
more padding on the metacarpal
and it's curved more. Uh Huh.

1193
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,760
I don't know what they,
what they have shown though.

1194
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:30,200
Belterra has had far less handbrakes
because of that. Oh really? Yeah.

1195
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,230
But then again,
it goes back to the football thing,

1196
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:37,670
like maybe you're better off knowing
that you can't just tee off on someone's

1197
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:40,100
head without breaking your hand.
I mean,

1198
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:42,290
if guys had to be more
conservative with their punches,

1199
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:43,880
maybe we would see more kicks.

1200
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:47,420
Maybe we'd see more grappling and
maybe MMA would be more realistic.

1201
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:52,220
And that's true, man. That's true. I don't
know. I don't know what the answer is.

1202
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,270
Yeah, I tickets. We have a bunch
of issues in MMA right now.

1203
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:59,730
The judging issues. A tremendous
man. What's going on with that man?

1204
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:03,300
You see the Diego Sanchez, Ross
Pearson, five crazy fucking ridiculous.

1205
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,490
Crazy ridiculous.

1206
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,550
I haven't seen one person that
thought Diego Sanchez won that fight,

1207
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:12,370
other than Diego Diego's family
know. And I love Diego. I'd think,

1208
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:15,870
you know, it's not Diego's fault that
they scored it wrong, but God damn,

1209
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:20,040
that was a bad decision. It was very bad.
Yeah. I mean, Diego's got a lot of heart.

1210
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:23,550
You can't, you can't take it
away from him. He's that guy.

1211
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:27,810
He's a Yamato Dimasi right?
He is. He's a motherfucker.

1212
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,950
Diego Sanchez comes to watching the
guy from one of my all time favorites.

1213
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:32,970
He's a wild man.
Yeah.

1214
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:38,400
He's one of the few guys today that's
still fights with complete total reckless

1215
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:41,820
abandon, you know, especially when
he starts getting hurt. Oh yeah.

1216
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,800
It's face could be hanging up.

1217
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:47,190
When he fought Martin Kampmann and that
third round, his face was hanging off,

1218
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:52,430
hanging off of his skull and he's
charging like a wild beast with rabies.

1219
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,160
He's a crazy dude, man. He's
fun to watch fight. He's pure,

1220
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:03,300
pure aggression. That guy. Pure aggression
and heart. I like that guy. Yeah,

1221
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:07,000
love watching him fight man. I just
don't think he won that decision. Yeah,

1222
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:11,610
I don't think so either. What do you think
about the way the UFC has rounds too?

1223
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:15,450
Cause one of the things I really loved
about pride was that first 10 minute

1224
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:19,590
round that really separated
like the people that had real,

1225
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:22,680
true endurance and knew
how to pace yourself.

1226
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:26,130
There's one thing pacing yourself
on a five minute round is one thing.

1227
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:29,550
Patient yourself on a 10 minute round as
an entirely different proposition when

1228
01:12:29,551 --> 01:12:33,900
it comes to conditioning. Yeah. Well,
again, he goes to the question, you know,

1229
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:39,590
the reason why am amazed being changed
in the way it is for the sponsors and for

1230
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:42,540
the,
for the audience.

1231
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,250
And I think it's depending on the
fighter can you mentioned, you know,

1232
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,850
you have those boring fights where
they get to the ground and you exist.

1233
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,701
Why don't you stand up?

1234
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:53,610
But they're doing enough that they don't
get broken up and you're like, damn,

1235
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,320
five minutes is that that bad?

1236
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:58,650
But he can't imagine that happening
for 10 minutes. Yeah, that's true.

1237
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:01,410
That's the thing. That's, I think that's
the thing that really works for the,

1238
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,910
the sport now because they're
shorter rounds for the audience.

1239
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,170
I agree. But there's a purist in
me that I don't like stand ups.

1240
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,390
I don't think you should be stood up.
Yeah.

1241
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:15,510
I think if the guys on the bottom and
you don't like the fact that the guy's

1242
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,300
holding you down,
you got to get better at getting up.

1243
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,020
You got to get better at sweeping
them. You've got to get better at. Uh,

1244
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,070
it's just trying to
attack from the bottom,

1245
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,850
attacking to try to get a better position
to stand back up or to try to finish

1246
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:27,684
him from your back.

1247
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,220
I just don't think it's realistic for a
guy just to hang on and let the referee

1248
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:35,190
standing back up again. Which is a
strategy. You see it all the time. Well,

1249
01:13:35,191 --> 01:13:38,460
it's a sport. No. Yeah, yeah. If you're
looking at it as a fight, you know,

1250
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:43,260
that's why he's a good MMA fighter.
What he's, I mean like a street fighter.

1251
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:46,290
It's a whole different thing.
Right. But even as a sport,

1252
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,410
I think if you're going to look at the
sport, it's still the sport of fighting.

1253
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:52,290
And if a guy can hold you down,
he's holding you down.

1254
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:53,730
Like you can't just stand them up.

1255
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:57,270
Like she worked hard to get that guy down
and the guy on the bottom doesn't want

1256
01:13:57,271 --> 01:13:59,240
to be there. So the guy in
the bottom technique. Yeah,

1257
01:13:59,241 --> 01:14:01,530
he's just knocking his hands
and just holding them. Yeah.

1258
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:05,490
Just to get a better position stood up
again. That's what a lot of guys do.

1259
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,190
They just wait to get stood back up. I
think that's kind of crazy. Yeah, it,

1260
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:14,250
I don't like that either. I to see a guy
like, you know, you know Charles Olivera,

1261
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,233
you know that kid.

1262
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,690
I like watching that guy fight because
he's so dangerous off of his back because

1263
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:19,931
he's,

1264
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:23,290
he's real aggressive standing up and one
of the reasons why he's so aggressive

1265
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,720
standing up, he's not worried about
being taken down because if he,

1266
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,810
he's taken down,
it's tax a tax,

1267
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:32,440
a tax right away off of his back arm
bars triangle. Like this is no picnic.

1268
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:34,870
Taking that guy on the ground,
you take him down to the ground,

1269
01:14:34,871 --> 01:14:37,990
you just did another different type
of account is constantly attack. Yeah,

1270
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:41,410
I like that. That's good. Yeah. When
the guys have one dimensional games,

1271
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:45,400
that's when getting taken down becomes a
problem because they get taken down and

1272
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:49,030
then the guy can hold them there, but
you can't hold some guys, you know,

1273
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:52,150
there's guys that have wicked guards.
You take them down and man,

1274
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:53,770
you're in a fucking new world,
a shit.

1275
01:14:54,930 --> 01:14:59,470
You're just running into another sort of
a situation where you can get submitted

1276
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:03,790
or lose the fight.
I think that that's the best way for MMA.

1277
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:08,820
The be the best way is not standing guys
up because then why not even just why

1278
01:15:09,011 --> 01:15:11,290
have it MMA then?
Why not just fight kickboxing?

1279
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:15,800
If you just want to fight standing up
then where there's no threat of takedowns,

1280
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,830
then you could do some wild shit,
you know?

1281
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:22,510
But you have a different sport then
if you're going to have takedowns.

1282
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:27,190
I don't think you should have standups.
I really don't. Yeah, true. But stem,

1283
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:32,140
can you imagine the sponsor's wouldn't
like that TV would be baseball,

1284
01:15:32,141 --> 01:15:37,030
man. How do they watch
baseball? I way more boring.

1285
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,460
They will watch it. True. You look at
that then they should not break them.

1286
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:46,660
That's not that boring I to look
at that. It's not even close. Well,

1287
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:50,350
even football man. What do you think?
Two on ones and stuff. I don't like that.

1288
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,360
You don't like that man? No.
The team fighting shit. Oh,

1289
01:15:53,361 --> 01:15:56,380
not the team fighting like two on one.
Even two on one.

1290
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,780
I think the deal strategy man,

1291
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:04,160
I think two one one would be interesting
if it's like a guy like you versus to

1292
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:08,420
non trained guys. Would that
be funny? That'd be exciting.

1293
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:12,790
Exciting non train big guys.
Yes. Non trained guys though.

1294
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:16,510
But with train guys.
No that's like a circus.

1295
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:23,100
But like say if you had a guy like John
Jones versus to like football players

1296
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:27,820
that don't really know how to fight, that
would be exciting. Exciting. It would,

1297
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:28,810
that would be exciting.

1298
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:33,820
But a guy like John Jones versus
two John Jones's? No. Yeah,

1299
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:36,370
no way. I don't want to see
that. I mean for me I always,

1300
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:41,350
I always felt that there was one of the
things I wanted to try and do two on one

1301
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:44,570
ace fight two guys at one time and see
because there's a hole in your fear live

1302
01:16:44,571 --> 01:16:46,720
in. Yeah. Oh yeah. Fuck yeah.

1303
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:51,010
So there's that fear element is what I
was kinda intrigued to try and experience.

1304
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,580
Would you want to fight two guys
at the same size as you know,

1305
01:16:53,581 --> 01:16:56,320
but like say if I'm,
if I'm too,

1306
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:01,180
I'm too 30 like guys that
are like 180 or 200 pounds,

1307
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:06,250
just have a little bit of
advantage of size and then yeah,

1308
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:11,510
the issues would be different now.
Yeah. Yeah. Well that's what I'm saying.

1309
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:14,750
Like two untrained guys,
you get like too rough,

1310
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:19,190
tough fucking football players, you know,
they don't really know how to fight,

1311
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:23,030
give him like a couple of weeks to fucking
hit or whatever. Just a little bit,

1312
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,660
you know, just a couple of weeks to
do some fight training. But the real,

1313
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:31,100
the reality is a guy like you versus a
football player that has no martial arts

1314
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:35,210
experience, he would need years just
to be able to survive on his own.

1315
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,960
But two of them, they have that, you
know, the gangster fights. Yeah. Yeah.

1316
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:43,130
And it's a,
it's actually pretty semi trained.

1317
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:46,820
All of them are semi train and that
you didn't even like gangster fights.

1318
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,230
You're talking about the Russian?

1319
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,010
No one's in Japan that the
Yakuza is fine and stuff,

1320
01:17:52,011 --> 01:17:54,530
but really they have one guy and Liza Lou.

1321
01:17:54,531 --> 01:17:58,610
You guys are a little bit
smaller and this, it's crazy.

1322
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:03,200
Some of the fights man.
So it's one guy versus two guys.

1323
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:07,770
One guy versus two guys. And the the,
the two guys are a little bit smaller.

1324
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:11,030
A little bit smaller. Just a little
bit. Yeah. And the Yakuza sets these up.

1325
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,350
There's a, there's a fights that are
run by them. Yeah. Is it organized? Yes.

1326
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,280
Organized is, we're organized.
They call it though. It's um,

1327
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:20,670
they call it a Chica cock.

1328
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,450
Togi Chica is underground and Cocteau
gears fighting Chica. Cocteau Ogee yeah.

1329
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,530
So underground fight weight.
If you're in Japan when they have one,

1330
01:18:27,531 --> 01:18:30,660
I'll take you to fuck. Yeah,
hazy. Then you know, the fun,

1331
01:18:30,710 --> 01:18:35,710
the good thing about it is a lot of
these guys don't have that much skill and

1332
01:18:35,751 --> 01:18:39,050
they just did this a bra.
Wow.

1333
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:43,160
Now do they have like a doctor standing
by for these things or they have a ring

1334
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:45,140
doctors, they have referees,
they have everything.

1335
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,590
And you could get away with that
in Japan because of the Yakuza has,

1336
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:53,060
it's a different sort of a scenario then
like say the mafia in America. So yeah,

1337
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:56,270
it's a little bit different. Yeah. I guess
much more accepted. Right? Yes it is.

1338
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:00,860
It's, it's, it's something inside
of people know that's around. Wow.

1339
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:04,940
But it's not something that you
want to be public about, Huh? Yeah.

1340
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,320
They made me cover up my tattoos.

1341
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,570
We've talked about this the last
time we were on the podcast,

1342
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:11,180
I was in a gym and they made
me put on a long sleeve shirt.

1343
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,300
You come back and you can't
probably can't shower here. Yeah.

1344
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,920
Because shower my room. Um,
so, but the Yakuza is just,

1345
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:22,370
is not talked about, but it's
everywhere. It's everywhere.

1346
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:26,480
You can see them a wrong, there's nice
guys that are, cause there's assholes.

1347
01:19:26,481 --> 01:19:30,320
There's this, a whole bunch of, I've,
I've had a lot of stuff with them. Yeah.

1348
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:33,410
We talked about a little bit about that
last time. You were here on the podcast.

1349
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,980
We had a smack the shit out of some
guy. It's all in the book too. Okay.

1350
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:40,370
Now tell me about the book and when is
it out? This is the one for you, man.

1351
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,390
Beautiful. Oh, awesome.
Beautiful. Yeah, it's uh,

1352
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:49,400
I think four years in the making
them live as a man, die as a man,

1353
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:53,450
become a man.
And do you understand that saying yes.

1354
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,990
Do you know that? You know, do
you know what I think? Well,

1355
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:58,370
I don't know if we talked about it before,
but you know,

1356
01:19:58,371 --> 01:20:03,200
the middle line is to die when
everyone thinks that that's the end.

1357
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,160
So everyone thinks that the normal
reading would be to live as a man,

1358
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,063
become a man and

1359
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:12,010
a man. But I believe that
until you faced it more,

1360
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,960
most fearful tests of dying, you don't
know how strong you actually are.

1361
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:21,810
Hmm. So you live your life with all these
little tests in life or little's trials

1362
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:26,780
that you have to build your strength
and build your heart to the last test of

1363
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:27,614
the dying.

1364
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:32,010
And the way you die is going to determine
whether you've passed that test or not.

1365
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,710
So that's why I like that
title. Yeah. That's a,

1366
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:40,500
in today's Day and age,
this strange,

1367
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:44,040
soft pussified society that we live in.
You know,

1368
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:47,250
and there's a lot of good things about
the pussified society. Don't get me wrong,

1369
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,400
there's a lot of good things about people
being civil with each other and about

1370
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:53,310
having laws and about having,
you know,

1371
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:56,280
being able to get your food from grocery
store. All those things are good,

1372
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,150
but what's bad about all these things,
and it's not bad about these things,

1373
01:21:00,151 --> 01:21:01,650
but the,
the,

1374
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:06,600
the repercussions of them is
that men don't develop character.

1375
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:10,080
And a lot of men fold under
pressure because they've
never experienced pressure.

1376
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:11,610
They don't know themselves.

1377
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,550
They don't know what they're capable
of because they've never had to face

1378
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:18,360
adversity, true adversity. When you
were really worried about your life,

1379
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,810
when you're really worried
about your safety, when you are,

1380
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:24,560
your back is up against the wall and
you either rise to the occasion or your

1381
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:28,260
dwarfed by the moment. And so many
people that have never faced adversity,

1382
01:21:28,261 --> 01:21:30,840
they just immediately fall
apart. They panicked, they fold,

1383
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:34,640
they don't know what to do. Yeah.
That's what you were fighting against.

1384
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:37,310
Yeah. And um, the,

1385
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:42,460
a lot of it is in the book is a lot of
the stuff that I've went through and it's

1386
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:47,561
not like me being a big hero and being
flying with bright colors in every

1387
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:48,561
experience.

1388
01:21:48,561 --> 01:21:52,160
Sometimes there's experiences where
I really just fucked up and I just,

1389
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,690
and some of those fuckups you're
actually really taught me about like, uh,

1390
01:21:56,810 --> 01:22:00,620
there was, uh, the book starts off with
this story about my friend that, uh,

1391
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,650
was when we were,
when I was little and like 12 years old,

1392
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:09,460
I watched a friend get beat up by bigger
guys and I didn't do anything about it.

1393
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,740
I was so scared.
I was frozen,

1394
01:22:12,741 --> 01:22:17,741
I didn't know what to do and I just
watched it and I was afraid of getting

1395
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:22,640
involved and getting hurt, physically
hurt, you know, beaten, beaten up,

1396
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:23,690
possibly go in the hospital,

1397
01:22:23,691 --> 01:22:27,980
possibly a broken bone and I
didn't do anything about it.

1398
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:29,210
And Wow.

1399
01:22:29,270 --> 01:22:34,100
The thing about that now is if I did
something about it and say I got a broken

1400
01:22:34,101 --> 01:22:38,780
arm, broken leg, they broke my
by orbital, I'd be here today,

1401
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:43,310
probably healed up because the body
heals. But to this day, even that,

1402
01:22:43,311 --> 01:22:47,210
even if that episode was 30 something
years ago, I still hurt from that insight.

1403
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:50,660
Thinking about that, wishing I could
rewind and do something about it,

1404
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,750
wishing I could see that my friend
again and tell him, I'm sorry.

1405
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,660
What'd we see my friend
and telling him, man, fuck,

1406
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,310
I don't know why it didn't help you.
You know?

1407
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:02,240
I never saw the guy again after
that. The Ma. Yeah, and it was,

1408
01:23:02,241 --> 01:23:06,000
it's something that just is even just
talking about it right now, it's just it,

1409
01:23:06,001 --> 01:23:10,750
it, I, I heard about it. I
hurt, I hurt. I in my heart.

1410
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,740
I heard thinking about it.

1411
01:23:11,770 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah. Do you think that those
moments when you have these, the,

1412
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:16,834
these moments,

1413
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:21,990
those are to s to make the wrong decision
and to feel the repercussions of that

1414
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:23,074
wrong decision?

1415
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:28,410
That's an integral part of the learning
process because when something comes up

1416
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:30,611
in the future,

1417
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:34,210
you've experienced the pain of the wrong
decision and then the right decision

1418
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:37,290
becomes the only decision. Yeah. That's
probably the best way to learn. Yeah.

1419
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:41,320
Trial and error. It's the only way I
think to really truly understand it.

1420
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:44,780
You can learn a little bit from
other people's mistakes. You know,

1421
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:48,880
you can sort of internalized
their mistakes and you put
it in into your category

1422
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:50,890
or your or your catalog
rather of knowledge.

1423
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,020
But I think to truly have a
a real lesson in your head,

1424
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,180
yeah,
you almost have to fuck it up yourself.

1425
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:58,341
Well,

1426
01:23:58,341 --> 01:24:02,600
that one experience has helped me make
the right decisions and a lot of other

1427
01:24:02,601 --> 01:24:05,510
things that came later in my life,
but still that, just that one,

1428
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:08,780
that one just still hurts, man.
30 something years later, man.

1429
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,120
Wow. Any bone that was broken would
have been healed by that. Wow.

1430
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:17,870
That's the true thing also about
losses is that everybody wants to win.

1431
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,650
Winning is everything when he's the
only thing, it's not everything.

1432
01:24:21,651 --> 01:24:24,520
It's the only thing. People always
say that there are no second place,

1433
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,720
first loser,
you know,

1434
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:31,750
but the reality is those losses and that
awful feeling of those losses are so

1435
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,870
fucking important for the growing process.

1436
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,210
If you don't realize what it's like to
drop your hands and get cracked by a

1437
01:24:39,211 --> 01:24:42,740
counter shot, you don't
realize how important it is
to really keep your hands up.

1438
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:46,340
You you won't. No, you
won't internalize it,

1439
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:49,300
but when you've been cracked and
rocked and you wind up losing a fight,

1440
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:50,143
you're like fuck.

1441
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:55,250
Then when you're in that fight again or
in another fight that those lessons are

1442
01:24:55,251 --> 01:24:59,630
concrete, those lessons are
tangible. Those lessons are
a part of who you are now.

1443
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,040
I suppose it depends on

1444
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,140
what level. Are you going to
look at wins and losses at? Yeah,

1445
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:08,210
because if after you fight, if someone
asks me after I fought, how'd you do?

1446
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:11,690
I mean if you're talking
about the way I think,

1447
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:16,520
I don't know yet cause I'm going to know
if I won or lost that fight in my next

1448
01:25:16,521 --> 01:25:19,430
fight. If I become a better
fighter because of that experience,

1449
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:23,750
I'm a better fighter. I won because I
gained and I got better. So you know,

1450
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,280
losses are determined on what you're
going to do after the law. Awesome.

1451
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:27,450
Yeah.

1452
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:32,010
There's oftentimes wins that fuck a
fighter up more than a loss does because

1453
01:25:32,011 --> 01:25:35,580
like say maybe you catch a guy with one
punch and you knock them out and then

1454
01:25:35,581 --> 01:25:38,940
you just decide that you're a knockout
puncher now instead of being 10 Finkel

1455
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:42,360
instead of using a comprehensive game,
you just kind of a striker.

1456
01:25:42,361 --> 01:25:46,470
All of a sudden, a lot of guys,
man, a lot of guys who are Jujitsu,

1457
01:25:46,471 --> 01:25:49,740
black belts all the sudden started
getting in these kickboxing matches and

1458
01:25:49,741 --> 01:25:53,370
getting fucked up and it was so
frustrating for me to watch, like,

1459
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:58,640
I understand that you like to strike
however you are fucking wizard on the

1460
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,720
ground and you're not even attempting.

1461
01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:04,310
She use these skills because
you had in this one thing,

1462
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:09,110
so they decided they were a striker. A
lot of the game is the mind, right? Yeah.

1463
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,780
The book covers every fight.

1464
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:16,610
Exactly how I was thinking from when I
got the fight to when I was preparing for

1465
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:18,020
the fight during the fight.

1466
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:21,180
It's going to be interesting because a
lot of people think that I'm just the

1467
01:26:21,181 --> 01:26:25,610
almost the dom mushy guy that has no
fears and just comes out and has this iron

1468
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:26,930
type of thinking.

1469
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,950
But it kind of tells you exactly
what I'm thinking during the fight,

1470
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:35,060
what happened, what I thought
after the fight. And it's, it's,

1471
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:37,580
it's straight up real stuff.
I mean,

1472
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:41,680
well, you know, custom motto, the
Guy, the long time trained Mike Tyson,

1473
01:26:41,681 --> 01:26:45,790
famous guy who was really what his,

1474
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,360
his take wasn't just the
technical aspects of boxing,

1475
01:26:49,361 --> 01:26:51,700
but also the psychology behind boxing.

1476
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:54,220
And one of the things that
he ingrained in Mike Tyson,

1477
01:26:54,221 --> 01:26:58,930
he said that a coward and the
hero feel the exact same thing.

1478
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:02,740
It's just that the hero chooses to act.

1479
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:06,610
Why the coward falls apart
is what you'd do at fury.

1480
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,060
It's what you do with the fear. And his
other thing was that fear is like fire.

1481
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:13,450
It can, it can cook your food
for you, it can keep you warm,

1482
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,110
or if you lose control of it, it can burn
your house down and kill you. Yeah. Yeah.

1483
01:27:17,111 --> 01:27:21,430
That's so real. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like it's your,

1484
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:25,990
your impressive performances are more
impressive knowing that you were scared

1485
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:28,390
knowing that you had all the
fears that everybody else has,

1486
01:27:28,391 --> 01:27:32,300
but you decided anyway to still
clamped down your mouthpiece and,

1487
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:35,950
and fucking throw led at equal vote.
Shanshan yeah,

1488
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:41,530
that's, that's what I was fighting
for this Yamanto Dimasi and you know,

1489
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,540
eastern eastern philosophy,

1490
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:46,630
which is very different in a lot
of ways than western philosophy.

1491
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,740
The philosophy that a lot of
people associate with martial arts,

1492
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,040
the respect and honor,
integrity and warrior spirit.

1493
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:58,690
A lot of that is kind of missing in some,
some MMA camps.

1494
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,490
And it's almost like they become
jocks and athletes and not,

1495
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:05,890
not as much martial artists.

1496
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:11,160
What do you think about
that? I think it's, uh,

1497
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:13,350
it's something that's people are losing.

1498
01:28:13,351 --> 01:28:17,850
It is true that there's a benefit in
having that right. Well, indefinitely.

1499
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:23,450
Because what happens when you run your
gym and you fight in that mentality,

1500
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:27,610
you're, once you done with Emma,
you can't fight forever. Right?

1501
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,640
And when you're done with
it, it, it'll carry you.

1502
01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:32,220
It'll carry on with you as a person.

1503
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:35,880
If you're just being a jock and doing
just Emon man, you're just doing that.

1504
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,830
Once you're done with that,
you're going to,

1505
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:40,140
you're going to go into the real world,

1506
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:42,510
the person that you were
when you started fighting.

1507
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:43,700
Not only that,

1508
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,760
you'll probably be one
of those motherfuckers to
those boring ass glory day

1509
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:50,970
stories. They keep talking
about that Glenn. Yeah.

1510
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:54,060
Back when you won the Olympic
trials for wrestling and you know,

1511
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:55,900
it was doing great until I blew that disk.
You know,

1512
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:59,990
if you train with that
honor and discipline and
you develop that during your

1513
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:00,680
fighting career,

1514
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:03,390
you're going to definitely be a better
man when you finish your fighting career.

1515
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:08,900
Well, I got real lucky when
I first started, uh, doing
martial arts is that my,

1516
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:12,860
my taekwondo instructor was very into the,
the,

1517
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:17,880
the aspects of martial arts
that we consider like the
philosophy and the mindset

1518
01:29:18,161 --> 01:29:20,710
and the warrior code,
indomitable spirit,

1519
01:29:20,711 --> 01:29:25,711
like all these different things was
we're promoted very heavily and promoted

1520
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:29,740
that. One of the big ones was
that martial arts or just a ve,

1521
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,270
a vehicle for developing your human
potential and that this is even when you

1522
01:29:34,271 --> 01:29:37,520
can't kick and even when you can't
punch and even when your body's old,

1523
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:40,750
you're still doing martial
arts because this, this,

1524
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:44,070
this path that you are on this path of,

1525
01:29:44,071 --> 01:29:49,071
of learning this path of testing yourself
and this path of trying to overcome

1526
01:29:50,321 --> 01:29:53,500
resistance.
This will stay with you forever in life.

1527
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:57,750
Yeah. Well, yeah, I believe martial
arts for me was a steer in my life, uh,

1528
01:29:57,751 --> 01:29:59,760
stared at,
I had to climb to become a better person.

1529
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:01,980
Do you think that it would,

1530
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:06,090
I think it would stop a lot of bullying
if martial arts were mandatory in school.

1531
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:10,910
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It would, it
would stop a lot of them crazy. You know,

1532
01:30:11,450 --> 01:30:13,160
being tough fights in the school.
Yeah.

1533
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:14,911
Yeah.
Test.

1534
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:18,780
If guys could test each other and guys
could test themselves and guys can push

1535
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:23,040
themselves like in the gym and also just
develop confidence because you actually

1536
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:26,370
know how to fight instead of like
pretending you know how to find,

1537
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,290
try to scare people off
because you're insecure,

1538
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:32,010
which is what the bottom have those
though. No matter what. Less of it though,

1539
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,590
don't you think you'd have less
of it? Yeah, for sure. I mean,

1540
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:35,700
you have bullies in the gym.

1541
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:38,220
There's always going to be
problems with guys in the gym.

1542
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,460
Beat up on lesser talented guys,

1543
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:44,880
hurt guys when they're sparring and
supposed to be going 50% and they go 100%

1544
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:50,130
you're always going to have that goes
to have gym wars or one guy elevates a

1545
01:30:50,131 --> 01:30:53,160
little bit and the young guy catches up
to him and then the other guy takes it

1546
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:57,110
to another level and next thing you know
they're in a full on fight. Yeah. Yeah.

1547
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:01,020
When you were training
for, um, for MMA fights,

1548
01:31:01,470 --> 01:31:03,900
how did you structure your training?
Like when you,

1549
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:05,550
when you said about like say if you have,

1550
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,370
if you were about to fight
mark her for example,

1551
01:31:08,371 --> 01:31:10,980
and you have eight weeks
to prepare for your fight,

1552
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:13,620
how did you structure your training camp?
Did you do it all yourself?

1553
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,080
Did you have someone help
you design your programs?

1554
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,750
Um, I did a lot, um, work with Egan.

1555
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:22,570
Egan would help me out with a strategy.

1556
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:25,720
We'd helped me with a game
plan and then we'd set our,

1557
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,770
or our training in correspondence
to the game plan. Yeah,

1558
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:31,120
like mark curve for me.

1559
01:31:31,121 --> 01:31:34,840
I didn't think I could get strong and
big enough to match and powerful par.

1560
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,620
So I thought no getting
stamina and moving faster.

1561
01:31:38,621 --> 01:31:42,670
So I think I was like 94 kilos in
that fight. Yeah. What does 94 kilos?

1562
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,610
94 kilos,
I don't know.

1563
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:50,740
Let's find out two or tools
to a seven to eight maybe.

1564
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,850
Let's see how many pounds is 94 kilos?

1565
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:57,550
It is two oh seven two seven

1566
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:01,060
was like two 62

1567
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:04,150
65 town muscle. Yeah,
he was fucking gigantic.

1568
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:06,370
And he was saying that he was
going to throw total toy at me,

1569
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:10,190
so I was working my striking
when I actually went to, um,

1570
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:13,270
more Reese's Jim Murray Smith. Oh
really? And worked there with him.

1571
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:14,920
How did that fight go down?
I don't,

1572
01:32:14,921 --> 01:32:18,330
I don't want to tell her that
fine tacos here. We thought,

1573
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,680
I thought we're going to throw it down.
And he tackled me and I was like,

1574
01:32:20,681 --> 01:32:21,514
God damn.

1575
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:28,960
And he held me and just kind of chipped
away and he was good enough that I

1576
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:32,710
couldn't finish them, but he wasn't
good enough to pass my guard.

1577
01:32:33,170 --> 01:32:38,170
But he was good enough that I couldn't
our embargo and we got broken once and

1578
01:32:38,381 --> 01:32:43,381
that was when pride had those 10 minute
rounds or broken once and then dumb me

1579
01:32:43,871 --> 01:32:47,380
the second time I thought, okay,
we're going to stand though.

1580
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:52,090
And boom, he shot for a tackle.
Yeah. Yeah. That was frustrating.

1581
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:56,410
He was an interesting case because he
was one of those guys that sort of tested

1582
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:57,273
this.

1583
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:02,340
We were in the beginning of MMA when
people would watch the various styles and

1584
01:33:03,551 --> 01:33:07,780
the various strategies that people would
be successful with inside the octagon,

1585
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:11,470
they would try to figure
out what is the best way.

1586
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,500
Is it the best way to be a big wrestler?
Well No,

1587
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:17,920
if you fight Maury Smith Cause Maury
Smith figured out how to be a smaller guy.

1588
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:19,990
Chip away at the legs of Mark Coleman.

1589
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,210
Take it into the later rounds
and that's how he won the title.

1590
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:24,550
He won the title with stamina
and with his striking. Yeah.

1591
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,880
But then you see a guy like Mark Kerr
and who was like the very like as far as

1592
01:33:30,911 --> 01:33:35,911
you could go with like the big steroid
it up muscular frame and wrestling.

1593
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,440
I pull up a picture of Mark Carr.

1594
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:43,740
Mark Kerr in his prime was his nickname
was the smashing machine and the

1595
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:49,660
specimen. Huh? I got the specimen
smashing machine and he was a,

1596
01:33:49,661 --> 01:33:54,661
a big wrestler who didn't have like a
lot of skills as far as like submissions.

1597
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,340
Like he submitted a guy
what a can opener wants.

1598
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:01,450
Probably the only guy I ever late.
There was Jesus fucking Christ

1599
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,490
that is barely human. He was
fucking gigantic, man. Yeah.

1600
01:34:08,650 --> 01:34:11,230
That's the one I fought.
He submitted a guy,

1601
01:34:11,231 --> 01:34:15,880
he submitted a Dan Babish by
putting his chin in his eyeball.

1602
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:21,490
He talked to his chin into Bobas wishes,
eyeball and fucking and crushed his,

1603
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,990
his head into his own chin.
It's like he pulled his chin into the,

1604
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:30,670
like the guy's eyeball and tapped him I
think in mountain him and did that stuck

1605
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:33,890
his chin and his face. Wrong.
Strongest fuck I bet. Right? Yeah.

1606
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,590
So the strongest guys I fit.
Yeah.

1607
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:40,150
He was as big as you could get and
still do MMA. That was like that.

1608
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:44,710
He was the s like that example, like
for example, the big strong wrestler,

1609
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:48,790
he was the most extreme version. It was
real successful in the beginning. Oh yeah.

1610
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:53,250
Real successful. But it seemed like the
wheel started to come off after a while.

1611
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:57,770
No fighting. No, no. He did
a few fights afterwards,

1612
01:34:57,771 --> 01:35:01,580
but after the smashing machine documentary
came out and the folks have never

1613
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:03,200
seen that documentary.
That is,

1614
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:07,280
he's got an incredible amount of courage
for letting people into that world

1615
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:12,310
because mark had a significant problem
with painkillers and with drugs and

1616
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:16,400
showed it all in all of its,
they,

1617
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,520
they started that documentary wanting
to do a documentary to follow one of the

1618
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:24,800
best mixed martial arts fighter in
the world, the smashing machine,

1619
01:35:24,801 --> 01:35:28,220
the guy who a lot of people thought was
the heavyweight to wash and along the

1620
01:35:28,221 --> 01:35:29,210
way they,

1621
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:33,410
they caught it at the perfect time where
he was starting to unravel and they got

1622
01:35:33,411 --> 01:35:37,410
to see a guy whose life was just
sort of falling apart. That was,

1623
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:40,260
that was pretty crazy. This
is trends. It came out and

1624
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:44,180
shoot himself up all the time
with all these painkillers,

1625
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,230
painkillers or a motherfucker, man. Yeah.
That's a big thing, huh? Oh yeah. Yeah.

1626
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:54,950
Their opiates, very addicting.
Never tried them at all. No.

1627
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,710
No painkillers at all.
I never tried any drugs that marijuana.

1628
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:03,380
Did you ever like have a
surgery or anything like
that? No. No surgeries at all?

1629
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:05,930
Nothing. No. No knee surgery? Nothing? No.

1630
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:08,970
How the hell did you manage
to go through an Lma career?

1631
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:13,730
With no surgeries or luck.
I love you man. The worst.

1632
01:36:13,731 --> 01:36:17,810
I had to think it was the orbit of
crack from the Oit Royce Alger fight for

1633
01:36:17,811 --> 01:36:21,170
Royce Alger fight. Horrible. Okay. That's
what happened. That fight. You don't,

1634
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:25,070
when you interviewed me I was fine and
it went to the back and I felt my nose

1635
01:36:25,071 --> 01:36:29,300
was bleeding, so I blew my nose
in it. Just whoa, that's crazy.

1636
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:33,290
And it just filled my eye up with air.
And then the doctor came in and said,

1637
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:36,320
you can't fight. And I was like, no,
no, I'm fine. Please let me fight.

1638
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:40,580
I still can see. That was the who?
Tito Tito. It took your place.

1639
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:43,840
Wow.
Historical Shit.

1640
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:47,510
You know Tito Ortiz was molten.
It historical shit.

1641
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:51,890
What did you think about Tito Ortiz
fight in Beltour? That little guy,

1642
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,320
he fought flamenco.
Well,

1643
01:36:53,321 --> 01:36:56,330
I was hoping he did beat
the guy up because I was
thinking of that guy shouldn't

1644
01:36:56,331 --> 01:36:59,480
be calling on every week
class. It's ridiculous. And I,

1645
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,480
I didn't know what he was
thinking. Yeah, I'm glad.

1646
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:04,760
And he even knew what he passed
them all. He knocked the wall. Yeah.

1647
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:07,160
Put him to sleep that was wanting
to see what the head and arm choke.

1648
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,850
That was nice to see. Yeah. Tito's got
a really underrated submission game.

1649
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,940
A lot of people don't give
him enough credit for a
submission game. You know, he,

1650
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:18,150
he's big too. Fucking huge. Yeah. He's
like my weight class and I, when I,

1651
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:21,350
I just saw them the other time at one
of the events, he was a guest then.

1652
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:23,930
He's huge. He's enormous. Yeah.

1653
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:27,230
It's hard to believe he even makes two
oh five when you look at the drops,

1654
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:29,630
good weight.
Manko is like my size.

1655
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:34,040
He had no business being in the
cage with Tita and Tito. He called,

1656
01:37:34,041 --> 01:37:37,400
he's the one who called Tito out.
Right. I don't know what that's about.

1657
01:37:37,401 --> 01:37:39,260
And Tito's sort of sponsored him too,

1658
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:42,650
which is a lot of people thought like
some fuckery was afoot foot. They're like,

1659
01:37:42,651 --> 01:37:46,130
wait a minute. Cause Tito like teen
punishment. He represents team punishment.

1660
01:37:46,131 --> 01:37:49,550
Really? Oh, that's
weird. Huh? I don't know.

1661
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,370
I mean maybe they just said they can
make some money. Let's just do it.

1662
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,890
And she'll Manka wanted to test himself.
Uh, I don't know. You know, but,

1663
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,800
but when you see the two of them
inside the cage at the same time,

1664
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,650
at least they look,

1665
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:05,660
it's like a giant is fighting a little
mat and Tito got him to the ground.

1666
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:06,331
Man.

1667
01:38:06,331 --> 01:38:09,270
You just saw that weight and pressure
and just submitted them pretty quickly.

1668
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:14,220
Like we have the difference in the size
there. Yeah, I get that. This is crazy,

1669
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,630
but good for Tito. Get that
wind back man. You know,

1670
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,130
that's one thing that bums
me out is that people don't,

1671
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:23,790
I mean I guess Tito kind of brings it on
himself sometimes cause he says a bunch

1672
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:26,860
of crazy shit, but that guy
doesn't get enough credit. He,

1673
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:31,470
a lot of people disrespect him. Tito's or
real. He's a real pioneer. Yeah, he is.

1674
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:32,630
Oh yeah, for sure. He,

1675
01:38:32,660 --> 01:38:37,560
their bag with you in 97 and really
Tang Abby. That's the time. Yup.

1676
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:41,370
Yup. Yeah. I mean that's when tank
Abbott was the Huntington beach.

1677
01:38:41,371 --> 01:38:46,230
Bad boy does sort of became bad
boy somewhere along the line.

1678
01:38:46,231 --> 01:38:49,260
Right. Wow. Yeah, he was a
part of tank average crew.

1679
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,630
He said he learned a lot from tank Abbott.

1680
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:55,020
And it's interesting because what
you say about attitude and about,

1681
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:58,230
you know about the,
the mindset of fighting,

1682
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,960
that's what he said that he
learned from [inaudible] Tang.

1683
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:01,960
You learned from tag out.

1684
01:39:01,961 --> 01:39:05,040
But how did you go in there and fuck
somebody up and they'll just go in there

1685
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:06,480
and kick somebody's fucking ass.

1686
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:10,470
And that's what tank Abbott used to
do to say whatever you want about tank

1687
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:13,950
Abbott. That motherfucker never
passed on a fight would fight anybody.

1688
01:39:13,951 --> 01:39:17,640
And with an hour's notice and you know,
you could, you could literally call him,

1689
01:39:17,641 --> 01:39:18,750
he'll be on a bar stool,

1690
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:22,080
he'd be on a flight the next day headed
to wherever the fuck you wanted him to

1691
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:26,730
fight drunk. And he would win a
lot of those fights. Hard puncher.

1692
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:28,050
Cause he had that attitude.

1693
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,580
He was just ready to get in there and
fuck somebody up. If you're there,

1694
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:35,460
it is Tito right next to him. Oh
yeah, yeah. Oh it's a Odi tank.

1695
01:39:35,461 --> 01:39:39,400
Habits like God damn classic.
He's a classic guy.

1696
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,980
He was some wild fucking fights
inside the octagon. So crazy knockout.

1697
01:39:44,990 --> 01:39:47,790
So, yeah, I don't remember. I
don't know the last time he fought,

1698
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,890
but I have a feeling it was like,

1699
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:54,840
I want to say it was fairly
recently tank out of it or, yeah.

1700
01:39:54,841 --> 01:39:58,290
Somebody told me that he bought recently.
And let me see here.

1701
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:01,830
Let's look up on Wikipedia. They'll
tell us one of the last time he fought,

1702
01:40:01,831 --> 01:40:05,790
because I want to say that he
fought fairly recently. Yeah.

1703
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,040
I fought in 2013.
Whoa.

1704
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:11,670
He lost to a Reuben hurricane Villareal.

1705
01:40:12,330 --> 01:40:15,810
That's the same guy that boss route and
fought on one of his last fights too.

1706
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:19,560
And he beat Mike Bork in 2009.
So he took a,

1707
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:24,300
took four years off,
came back and lost and King of the cage.

1708
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:28,290
Wow. That wasn't even, was that even
though it wasn't a hyped up at all? No.

1709
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:32,730
It was kind of crazy. King of
the cage fighting legends. Wow.

1710
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:37,550
That was 2013. Oh, to watch that cab. You
probably didn't even know about it. Yeah,

1711
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:42,090
that's the problem. Sure. Yeah. It's
kind of crazy that it was so, uh,

1712
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,900
you know,
low profile before the ad.

1713
01:40:45,901 --> 01:40:50,490
He fought a Kimbo slice in 2008 yeah.
In Miami.

1714
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,800
That was before Kimbo when to the,

1715
01:40:54,780 --> 01:40:58,740
he fought Yoshida,
Yoshida and pride.

1716
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:05,100
And he got a, he got choked. Yeah.
It's a lot of fights. A lot of fights.

1717
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,830
Yeah. I mean if you look at his career
and there's a lot of losses in the air,

1718
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:14,340
but God damn classic fights. Yeah.
They are classic toys and went to his,

1719
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:18,170
that was his first fight.
His very first fight.

1720
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:20,970
And then Paul varlands remember that
fight? It was another great fight.

1721
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:24,350
There it is.
Can you the cage legends.

1722
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,650
Oh Wow. Tank. Gambit gray beard now.

1723
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:31,810
Still slinging led.

1724
01:41:34,670 --> 01:41:37,990
King of the cage is a place where a lot
of guys had their start, right? Yeah.

1725
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:42,190
King of the cage. Where did you have your
first fight? Uh, mine was in a shoot.

1726
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:44,740
Don't shoot. Oh yeah.
Did you find Super Bra?

1727
01:41:44,741 --> 01:41:49,000
Was that Egon funds first Superbowl
once? Yeah. You fought at once.

1728
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:50,150
Would you find it over there?
Uh,

1729
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:55,270
Tommy saw her and super ball was a
almost like old school valley Tuto style,

1730
01:41:55,271 --> 01:41:56,590
right? Yeah. Different rules.

1731
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:00,130
Hawaii had a different different set of
rules that you are allowed to compete

1732
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:03,260
under. Like what is it? What
was the rules of Superbowl? Um,

1733
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:06,310
at that time was more just like pride,
pride rules.

1734
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,880
When I fall soccer kicks knees to
the head on the ground ground. Yeah.

1735
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:12,490
I like those rules.

1736
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:17,140
Do you think that that the MMA
in its current form right now,

1737
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:20,620
like if you, if you could change any
of the rules and still keep it a sport,

1738
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:25,030
I think that first of all, 12 to six
elbows that that's got to come back.

1739
01:42:25,060 --> 01:42:28,480
I think 12 to six elbows as it is
a ridiculous thing to have band,

1740
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:32,850
but I think needs, needs to have grounded
opponent. We change a lot of shit too.

1741
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:37,060
Yeah. Even soccer ball kicks. I
think he's okay. Really? Yeah.

1742
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:40,930
You're fucking crazy. I think
those, I would like those to be in.

1743
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,630
The only thing I have a problem
with the soccer kicks is the cage.

1744
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,780
I liked the soccer kicks in a ring
because you can move your head away,

1745
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:51,580
but the fact that you're trapped and you
can get kicked and stomped when you're

1746
01:42:51,581 --> 01:42:52,660
trapped up against the cage,

1747
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:55,600
that's the only time that I think that
it would be a problem because the guy

1748
01:42:55,601 --> 01:43:00,040
can't really defend himself because of
the environment as opposed to because

1749
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:04,780
he's out. That would be just one more
danger in a cage. There's a lot of that.

1750
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:07,300
That's true. That's true. That's true.

1751
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,360
The people would be keeping their head
away from the cage a little more. Yeah.

1752
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:15,300
When you look back, I mean your
first fight in the UFC 1997, um,

1753
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,920
what was your first actual
mixed martial arts fight?

1754
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:23,230
Shoot it and I need 10 96
96 daddy's the early days,

1755
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:25,960
man, that was right after
Hickson and came to Japan.

1756
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:30,220
Hixon fought in the Japan valley that
maybe you want to fight you. Really? Yeah.

1757
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:34,690
Wow. That was incredible, man.
Those are incredible times.

1758
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,980
And when you look back at that
and now you see the guys of today,

1759
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:43,900
you see like the Demetrius mighty mouse
Johnson's and you see the John Jones is

1760
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:47,230
and these high level guys, the pound
for pound best guys at today, man,

1761
01:43:47,770 --> 01:43:52,340
it's just like a totally different thing.
Yes it is this, there's, there's actual

1762
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,140
fighters that are called
mixed martial artists now.

1763
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:59,010
Yeah. Full mixed martial art can do
everything. It's not a karate guy.

1764
01:43:59,011 --> 01:43:59,844
Back in the day

1765
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:04,260
that your fighter was either a striker
arrester or ground guy and it was always

1766
01:44:04,261 --> 01:44:09,000
a real straight up strategy to
fight in those. But now man,

1767
01:44:09,570 --> 01:44:12,450
they can get everything nowadays.
I mean I see the, you know,

1768
01:44:12,451 --> 01:44:15,840
the younger fighters coming
up nowadays and you know, the,

1769
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:19,200
some people tell me like, ah, when you
fought there was no money. There was,

1770
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:22,930
it was so small and shit and it wouldn't
you don't you wish your grandfather

1771
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:26,430
this day and age and I'm thinking
to myself, I don't know man. He,

1772
01:44:26,431 --> 01:44:29,790
Ken's a fighter's nowadays,
man, there's full me shed.

1773
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,630
They can their black blackbelt Jujitsu's
that are professional kickboxers and

1774
01:44:33,631 --> 01:44:35,370
wrestles, it can fight
boxing. You know what I mean?

1775
01:44:35,371 --> 01:44:39,900
It's like wrestlers would blackbelt
Jujitsu. It's unbelievable.

1776
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:43,220
And it's getting better. Yeah. It
seems to me that it's getting better.

1777
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:46,610
I mean it seems to me that the
level keeps rising the levels.

1778
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:49,700
Just wait Tj Dillashaw what the fuck?

1779
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:54,680
What the fuck like kid comes
out of nowhere. I mean,

1780
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:57,950
I thought that was going to be a real
difficult fight for him. I thought like,

1781
01:44:57,951 --> 01:45:01,790
man, Hanan Barao is a killer, one of the
best pound for pound guys in the world.

1782
01:45:02,150 --> 01:45:04,010
And then Tj Dillashaw just goes in there.

1783
01:45:04,220 --> 01:45:07,220
One's a clinic on one's a clinic on him.

1784
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:11,270
That was unbelievable and there's more
of those come out at then head kicks him

1785
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:16,020
in the fifth round and didn't ever fight
like he was ahead. Dude, never fight.

1786
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:20,720
Always trying to finish crazy.
It's good fighter, man. Fuck yeah.

1787
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:24,090
Great fighters that there's going to
be a rematch them that I hope so. Yeah,

1788
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,910
it should be. Man, I hope so. Well,

1789
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:30,110
there's a lot of great fights
at one 55 there's so many. Oh,

1790
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:34,490
Dominick Cruz, you know. [inaudible] never
had that division before. It was crazy.

1791
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:37,550
Yeah. Before it was just the
heavier guys. Yeah. Well,

1792
01:45:37,551 --> 01:45:39,320
I think they're probably
going to have a one 15 to,

1793
01:45:39,321 --> 01:45:41,600
they're going to have a straw weight.
Well,

1794
01:45:41,601 --> 01:45:43,460
there's a lot of great
fighters in other countries,

1795
01:45:43,461 --> 01:45:47,060
especially a lot of great Japanese guys.
One 15 a lot of Brazilian guys.

1796
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:50,690
One 15 I think that in a few more women,

1797
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:52,640
weight classes would be good too.
You know?

1798
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:56,840
I think they're going to do a one 25
women's weight class maybe at one 15 as

1799
01:45:56,841 --> 01:46:01,220
well. Yeah, that'd be big.
That's good. Yeah. It's amazing.

1800
01:46:01,221 --> 01:46:05,570
Time in exciting. Do you have
pride when you look back and you,

1801
01:46:05,571 --> 01:46:07,040
you think that you were like,
I mean,

1802
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:11,450
you were one of the real pioneers of
the fastest growing sport the world has

1803
01:46:11,451 --> 01:46:14,120
ever seen.
There's never been a time in my lifetime.

1804
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:18,890
There's never been a time where a sport
was introduced and became this gigantic

1805
01:46:18,891 --> 01:46:23,570
thing over a matter of a decade,
two decades, and groom viewable.

1806
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:27,800
How fast it grew and grew the
way the UFC has grown under row.

1807
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:33,020
There's nothing like that.
Yeah, it's amazing, dude.
You look back on that and go,

1808
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:36,560
wow, I was, you know, I was
in a special time in life.

1809
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:40,330
I looked back at that and see, yeah,
I love what's happening. I mean,

1810
01:46:41,380 --> 01:46:45,490
my life has made by him in me and I just,
I appreciate all the things, you know,

1811
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,770
Dana's doing the people who making it big.

1812
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:50,780
And you asked me if I have pride in that.
No,

1813
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:54,810
not really because I don't feel like I can
help. I'm the one who did all this. No,

1814
01:46:54,811 --> 01:46:55,560
I don't.

1815
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:00,560
I just feel it was the lucky person to
be the person that was actually there in

1816
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:05,010
the beginning to see what it was like
in meeting when it was banned in states

1817
01:47:05,011 --> 01:47:08,970
and every window, whenever someone
heard you or mixed martial arts fighter,

1818
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:12,900
they say, well, see, beat people up for
living all human cockfighting. You know,

1819
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:17,220
back in that day when it was like,
it's frowned upon now. It's like,

1820
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,430
it's a cool thing now is
so nice to see that change.

1821
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:25,500
Yeah. It is nice to see that change.
When I first was working, uh,

1822
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:26,381
on a Sitcom,

1823
01:47:26,381 --> 01:47:29,170
I was on a sitcom news radio and it
was when I first started doing the post

1824
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:30,970
fight interviews back when
I interviewed you. Yeah.

1825
01:47:30,971 --> 01:47:33,870
It's one of the first events I was a
second event I ever worked at. Oh Wow.

1826
01:47:33,970 --> 01:47:37,300
And um, I would tell people that I
was going, you know, it was like,

1827
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:40,150
where were we at? Augusta,
Georgia or something like that.

1828
01:47:40,151 --> 01:47:42,880
Where did you find Georgia? Yeah. And uh,

1829
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:45,930
I remember telling people that I was
going to go work for the UFC interviewing

1830
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:49,430
fighters after their matches and they'd
looked at me like I was fucking crazy.

1831
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:52,540
Like I was involved in dog fighting
or something. That's what it was like,

1832
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:56,050
like I was involved in porn or something
like that. Something. Yeah. Yeah.

1833
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:59,250
It was like that. Yeah. Now, you
know, people say, what do you do it?

1834
01:47:59,251 --> 01:48:02,200
So I do commentary for the
UFC. They go, Ooh, I love that.

1835
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:04,683
My husband,
I,

1836
01:48:05,110 --> 01:48:08,570
well, I see that change though. It's
amazing. Yeah. When I, when I see that,

1837
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,940
I mean think that I'm a,
you know, I was back in,

1838
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:15,650
I was lucky enough to be a part of that.
That's what I feel. Yeah. Back in the day,

1839
01:48:15,651 --> 01:48:16,130
man,

1840
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:19,880
I can only imagine from your position,
so from my position I feel very lucky,

1841
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:23,270
but obviously I'm an outsider
watching and commenting on it.

1842
01:48:23,271 --> 01:48:25,820
You were like in the, in the, in
the heat of the battle itself.

1843
01:48:25,821 --> 01:48:30,650
Are we on the UFC one one 75 on 25 yeah.
Was In 13 huh?

1844
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:36,530
It's crazy. 13 well not only
that, you were not just at one,

1845
01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:40,460
I think the position that you
were at UFC 12 I think the,

1846
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:45,410
in my opinion, the support changed
radically around UFC 12 because of detour.

1847
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:48,140
I think when [inaudible]
entered into the cage,

1848
01:48:48,141 --> 01:48:50,000
won that tournament at 19 years old,

1849
01:48:50,001 --> 01:48:55,001
at UFC 12 the whole game changed because
you've got to see really high level

1850
01:48:56,391 --> 01:49:00,590
striking from a Jujitsu black
belt. And he was, he was light,

1851
01:49:00,591 --> 01:49:04,220
but he was fast.
He was a tall total new specimen.

1852
01:49:04,870 --> 01:49:08,570
I mean it wasn't the v tour
that fought Randy coture.

1853
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:13,460
I think that veto got too big to like
two months for 204 days just to jacked.

1854
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:16,140
But when he fought,
yeah,

1855
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:19,550
he was like two oh five UFC 12 shredded,

1856
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:23,120
strong explosive fuck Sam.

1857
01:49:23,480 --> 01:49:26,450
And we first saw him when he's
first couple of fights, man.

1858
01:49:26,451 --> 01:49:28,430
It was just like this was a new athlete,

1859
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:33,610
completely new person that we'd never
seen like a skill level like that as far

1860
01:49:35,001 --> 01:49:38,210
as his hand speed, the boxing
combinations that he put together.

1861
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:41,930
Nobody had seen that before.
Yeah. Yeah. You know,

1862
01:49:41,931 --> 01:49:44,240
I think that you came at that time,

1863
01:49:44,241 --> 01:49:48,700
you came as a sport was just exponentially
and you were starting to see like

1864
01:49:48,701 --> 01:49:52,030
real world class athletes.
I think when time,

1865
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,170
when we look in the future and
they look back at this era,

1866
01:49:56,290 --> 01:50:00,260
like the era between 1993
in 2008, I really, uh,

1867
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:03,430
not only around today,
but still finding it the highest level.

1868
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:06,070
Which brings up another point.

1869
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:09,460
How do you feel about all this
testosterone replacement shit?

1870
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:15,240
Um, I wouldn't do it. If I was
fighting, I wouldn't do it.

1871
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:21,300
Um, I just, uh, I don't know if
I'm for it or against it. I mean,

1872
01:50:21,301 --> 01:50:23,940
if some of fighter wants to do it,
I wouldn't have a problem with my,

1873
01:50:24,060 --> 01:50:28,200
my opponent did it, you wouldn't have
a problem with your opponent doing it,

1874
01:50:28,201 --> 01:50:31,020
but you wouldn't do it. Yeah, I
wouldn't do it. Why wouldn't you do it?

1875
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:33,330
Uh,

1876
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:37,160
I guess I wouldn't know if it would, I
don't know the really real effects to it.

1877
01:50:37,161 --> 01:50:39,650
Yeah. And I feel like I can get, I can,

1878
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:43,280
I could get in shape enough
to fight without it. Yeah.

1879
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:47,210
John Fitch said something real interesting
once I talked to him about it and he

1880
01:50:47,211 --> 01:50:48,650
said, well, I get older. He said,

1881
01:50:48,651 --> 01:50:51,650
I would definitely take
hormone replacement therapy,
but not when I'm fighting.

1882
01:50:52,040 --> 01:50:56,000
He said, I want to know that everything
I did, I did because I did it.

1883
01:50:56,270 --> 01:51:00,410
I did with my hard work. I did
with my mind, you know, and that,

1884
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:04,160
that was fitches attitude. I thought that
was very admirable. You know, he's a,

1885
01:51:04,250 --> 01:51:08,090
he's a real man, you know, Fitch
lives by the sword dies by the sword.

1886
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:12,170
And that attitude that wasn't just
some talk and bullshit. I mean,

1887
01:51:12,171 --> 01:51:15,560
he's never been popped for PDS. It
doesn't look like he's doing. Um, yeah,

1888
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,230
it looks the same.
He's just a tough motherfucker,

1889
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:21,710
a hard nose wrestler who became a
great mixed martial arts fighter.

1890
01:51:21,711 --> 01:51:26,150
But that attitude was, you know, he wanted
to know that he did it all themselves.

1891
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:32,210
We see guys like, you know,
[inaudible] it's a perfect
example. We tore, got on TRT,

1892
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:36,340
got on testosterone replacement
therapy and became this it.

1893
01:51:36,580 --> 01:51:40,790
He had this resurgence where you
saw detour from the old days,

1894
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:44,000
the trade Talbmen fight. He was
19 years old. He was a phenom,

1895
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:48,260
but Vituro f a lot of folks don't know
post the Randy coture fight after Randy

1896
01:51:48,261 --> 01:51:53,210
coture beat him, he went
into a dark period where he
wasn't very good for awhile.

1897
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:57,350
Soccer rob a, beat him up. A lot of guys
beat him. Alistair Overeem submitted him.

1898
01:51:57,560 --> 01:52:01,700
He wasn't the same guy anymore. He lost
his confidence. For whatever reason,

1899
01:52:01,701 --> 01:52:02,360
they just,

1900
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:06,950
Dan Henderson beat him and
then he fought in the UFC,

1901
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:10,880
had some good fights,
but it didn't look like the same guy.

1902
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,020
Didn't look shred,

1903
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:16,490
got on testosterone replacement and then
all the sudden shot through the fucking

1904
01:52:16,491 --> 01:52:18,860
roof and became this motherfucker again.

1905
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:22,910
So I could see both.
See that's uh,

1906
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:26,720
the one on the left is him
pre testosterone in the
one on the right is post

1907
01:52:26,721 --> 01:52:30,860
testosterone. I mean I could see, well
this is the way in his photos, by the way,

1908
01:52:30,861 --> 01:52:33,800
these guys are completely
dehydrated. They don't look, yeah,

1909
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:37,440
there's sick mean when
you're weighing in your,

1910
01:52:37,441 --> 01:52:42,230
your body's completely dried out. They
lose over the, like Vito probably lose 10,

1911
01:52:42,231 --> 01:52:46,310
15 pounds easily just to make weight.
But the resurgence

1912
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:50,050
when you saw him fight Michael Bisping,
Luke Rockhold and,

1913
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,880
and then the rematch with Dan
Henderson, he was so fucking good. Yeah.

1914
01:52:55,730 --> 01:53:00,650
And it makes you wonder like, what is it?
Is that testosterone, is it hard work?

1915
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,500
Is that the testosterone that
allows them to work hard?

1916
01:53:03,501 --> 01:53:06,480
Like where is a kind of gray area?
Like where do you draw the line?

1917
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:10,620
Would hard work? Definitely Ken just
take talks to it and get good. He, yeah,

1918
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:13,430
it allows you to work harder I think.
Exactly.

1919
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,180
Definitely hard work and definitely
talent. And definitely his mind. Yeah.

1920
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:18,020
Confidence.
Yeah.

1921
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:22,250
But that's the thing about
the testosterone and allows
you to get that crazy

1922
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:26,510
gorilla confidence. It changes the
game. Right. And it does. But you know,

1923
01:53:26,511 --> 01:53:27,231
the thing is,
you know,

1924
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:31,230
as much as people that are against it
and that kind of cool to see him. Oh,

1925
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:34,340
the of the fights you put out cause
he's on it. That's a good point.

1926
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:37,220
It's like bodybuilding, yet people
like says fuck steroids and stuff.

1927
01:53:37,221 --> 01:53:38,860
But when they go to watch body of,
you think the,

1928
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:42,320
they are at the muscle tone
in the size and it's like,

1929
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:44,360
now I might get steroids,

1930
01:53:44,361 --> 01:53:49,340
but you go there and you
love the bodybuilding and
I say it's like a give and

1931
01:53:49,341 --> 01:53:51,530
take. Yeah. Yeah. Well
bodybuilding without steroids,

1932
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:55,490
it's almost not nonexistent to that. True.
None of those guys are clean. You can't,

1933
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:59,390
you can't get that big. Yeah. And be
clean. Be cleaned for the last year.

1934
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:04,180
Do they even test? I don't know what
the test they do with bodybuilding,

1935
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,230
but it's gotta be a Horse Shit.
You know,

1936
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:09,250
if somebody tests positive in
a bodybuilding competition,

1937
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,050
it's probably because they pissed off
the promoter and they said to test that

1938
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:15,050
motherfucker for real,
for real.

1939
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:21,260
This time and pride. Did they test you
at all on pride? No. They had a, I mean,

1940
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:25,040
do you get, he didn't know that they had
a clause in the contract. What clause?

1941
01:54:25,070 --> 01:54:27,740
They had a clause that
said what to test for. Oh.

1942
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:32,430
And they don't test for star test for, um,
the historic we'd the test for cocaine.

1943
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:36,830
They had a whole list and not only did,
did the steroids did not,

1944
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:39,830
wasn't on that list.
They had a sentence after that saying,

1945
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:44,240
we do not test for steroids. Wow. Yeah.
So it was, that was kind of crazy.

1946
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:49,490
Jason Chambers, you know, Jason Chambers,
he was a show, a human weapon. He fought,

1947
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:53,710
fought MMA a bunch of times. He's a
friend of mine, but he, um, he was, uh,

1948
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:57,170
they were trying to get him to fight in
pride and they want him to fight at one

1949
01:54:57,171 --> 01:55:01,740
85. And uh, he was like, but I
weigh one 70. And I was like,

1950
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,410
yeah, just to steroids. And
they were telling them to
do steroids and he was like,

1951
01:55:06,411 --> 01:55:07,244
what

1952
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:11,450
you were telling him we think you
should because he's a handsome guy.

1953
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:14,150
They were like, we should find that
one 85 and he's like, wait, what?

1954
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:17,330
They wanted him to juice up and look
big and muscular five [inaudible] five.

1955
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:21,430
And he was like, I'm not
wanting any five guys. You know,

1956
01:55:21,431 --> 01:55:22,790
I heard a lot of stories about that.

1957
01:55:22,791 --> 01:55:26,450
How pride used to like really
bullied the fighters are yeah.

1958
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:30,320
You never know. Days
Kiss my ass man. Really?

1959
01:55:30,380 --> 01:55:33,510
It was weird cause I remember mark
cursing saying something about how all

1960
01:55:33,530 --> 01:55:36,740
rampage was caught up like one
week before the soccer arba fight.

1961
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:38,250
And if he didn't take it,

1962
01:55:38,330 --> 01:55:41,450
they told him something that you'd
never find Japan again or something like

1963
01:55:41,451 --> 01:55:44,100
walking him around Linkedin and the

1964
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,700
same people that are bullying him
around at the people that I see.

1965
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:50,670
And I can't even imagine that
side of the character from them

1966
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:54,720
do think it's an exaggeration. Like maybe
not getting the full story from them.

1967
01:55:55,260 --> 01:55:58,590
Um, I think it's a play of
those to Japanese. Yeah. Oh,

1968
01:55:58,591 --> 01:56:01,350
they would know what they can do
either. You like, you know, like a dogs.

1969
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:03,270
Your dogs are mostly medium dark to you.

1970
01:56:03,271 --> 01:56:04,680
But then when your
friend takes care of him,

1971
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:07,740
he's pissing all over the place
and barking and shit. You know,

1972
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:11,100
I think it's the same thing. They didn't
know what they can get away with. Yeah.

1973
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:15,420
My friend, uh, Eddie Bravo was over my
house once and he was scared of my dog.

1974
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:20,490
And so my dog attack the cat in front
of them because he knew that Eddie was

1975
01:56:20,491 --> 01:56:23,140
scared of the dog.
He's like a head.

1976
01:56:23,141 --> 01:56:25,740
He just decided that he's
the boss because the dog,

1977
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:27,270
cause I was just taking a shit.

1978
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:30,540
He freaked out and he starts screaming
and I had a run in and rescue the cat,

1979
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:35,220
but he just decided that Eddie was a punk
because Eddie was scared of him and he

1980
01:56:35,221 --> 01:56:39,330
could feel it. So he decided I've been
wanting to bite this fucking cat say way.

1981
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:45,330
But it was a clear example of that
because Eddie Eddie wasn't used to being

1982
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:48,630
around big dogs. He didn't know
how to handle them and you know,

1983
01:56:48,631 --> 01:56:49,291
he didn't know that.

1984
01:56:49,291 --> 01:56:53,100
You just got to be friendly with the dog
and just establish said he was like, oh,

1985
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:55,110
she was always like this
around the dogs and dogs.

1986
01:56:55,111 --> 01:56:58,410
Like this motherfucker's stairs a thing.
I'm running shit here.

1987
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:02,460
But it was a clear example,
but he would never do that in front of me.

1988
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:06,600
Never attack the cat in front of me.
But in front of Eddie, he just decided

1989
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:11,540
that's a good example. I think it's
perfect example. So they bullied.

1990
01:57:11,541 --> 01:57:15,170
Those guys are owning these guys.
Would you, do you remember the guy,

1991
01:57:15,230 --> 01:57:17,890
the Guy Minster incident with me?
What happened with guy?

1992
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:22,610
He fought Egan and then we had a little
thing in the ring with him. Yeah.

1993
01:57:22,611 --> 01:57:24,820
What happened? Well,
he was supposed to, um,

1994
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:29,720
or apparently this is what he said was
he was supposed to call me out in a bad

1995
01:57:29,721 --> 01:57:32,830
way. I just retired. Right. And he,

1996
01:57:32,831 --> 01:57:36,080
he beat Egan and they told
him to call it to do that.

1997
01:57:36,081 --> 01:57:38,030
And they told him that I knew about it.

1998
01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:42,050
So six some purchasing bullshit
thing by I not know nothing about it.

1999
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:46,730
So I'm here, I go into the ring
after Egan losers and I'm just going,

2000
01:57:46,731 --> 01:57:49,250
you know how you go check on your
fighter? Yeah, I checked on you. Okay,

2001
01:57:49,251 --> 01:57:53,360
everything's okay. Guy Walks up
to me and says, it's not personal.

2002
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:57,980
And like, what's not personal?
You'd beat up my brother. Of course,

2003
01:57:57,981 --> 01:58:01,130
it's not personal, Hugh,
congratulations. He goes, no,
no, no. What I would have to do,

2004
01:58:01,780 --> 01:58:04,100
that's what are you talking about?
And if you see the video,

2005
01:58:04,430 --> 01:58:08,150
I'm shaking his hand and he's telling me
the other shake his hand and I'm like,

2006
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,460
I don't let go of his hand.
And the weird I'm there were like,

2007
01:58:11,020 --> 01:58:13,490
I'm guiding them into the
corner. Like, what do you
mean? What are you going to do?

2008
01:58:14,690 --> 01:58:18,410
And he goes, I got to call you
out. I said, well, yeah, you
know, I'm retired. He goes,

2009
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:22,250
yeah, but it's in my contract. I said,
no, no, fuck you. I said, I told him,

2010
01:58:22,251 --> 01:58:24,830
if you don't want it, do it. Don't
fucking do it. And it was answered.

2011
01:58:24,831 --> 01:58:27,140
I got to do it. And I said, don't
fucking do it if you don't want to do it.

2012
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:31,400
And then I then I realized that the way
pride plays that shit with the creditors

2013
01:58:31,970 --> 01:58:34,750
and I realized that, you know, guy
was in this position that, you know,

2014
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,580
he really couldn't do anything about.
And so I was like, you know, guys,

2015
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:41,030
not guys deal, you know, guys, not
the bad guy here. And he's like,

2016
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,380
so he turned around and he did
it different. No, he didn't.

2017
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:48,400
He didn't be a dick about it. He kind of
went in, she said, uh, something about,

2018
01:58:48,401 --> 01:58:51,370
yeah, the, the better fight would have
been with his younger brother and son.

2019
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:55,660
But after that,
it's all in the book too.

2020
01:58:55,661 --> 01:58:59,490
But after that it went in the locker
room. And I guess, I dunno, I think I'm,

2021
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:02,500
Gary Glitter's is in my locker room.
Igor was in the locker room.

2022
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:04,000
Those spiders all saw this happened.

2023
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:08,110
But I went on a rampage to calling for
the president of the pride to come in and

2024
01:59:08,111 --> 01:59:11,260
see me right now because that's bullshit.
It's purchasing bullshit doesn't work.

2025
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,010
Wow. And they wouldn't bring
them. So I would always, you know,

2026
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:17,820
the little staff guys that year,
I was kicking them around and tell him,

2027
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:22,780
get the president and the one of the
guys come in, this guy called Kawasaki,

2028
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,160
he was a matchmaker for pride.

2029
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:29,080
And I got on a mid term on the ground
[inaudible] really as a huge thing.

2030
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:31,950
You throw him on the ground
when they grind them all in him.

2031
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:34,270
And then Egan stopped me and then,
and then I told him,

2032
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,640
I don't want to see you on a seat,
Morty still the prison.

2033
01:59:36,641 --> 01:59:37,540
That's when he was alive.

2034
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:41,620
And of course in the middle of the events
you can think prison just can't come

2035
01:59:41,621 --> 01:59:45,820
in. But the vice president comes in
and then he sits me down and he says,

2036
01:59:45,821 --> 01:59:47,800
you know, are, we didn't know nothing
will get to the bottom of this.

2037
01:59:47,801 --> 01:59:50,770
But according to guy,
that's the guy he talked to.

2038
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:54,650
So it was in the contract that he was
supposed to call you and Meagan the,

2039
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:59,700
and then the president wound up dead and
strangled in like he hung himself on a

2040
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:04,800
fucking shower rod or something.
Yeah, that's a weird one, Huh?

2041
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:09,240
Yeah. Cause I talked to him a week before
that and he, he told me that, um, um,

2042
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,630
or if he telling me that he,

2043
02:00:10,631 --> 02:00:14,140
he likes the way I fight and he
wants fighters to fight more like me.

2044
02:00:14,170 --> 02:00:17,410
I remember him telling you that and he
had a big image about changing the fight

2045
02:00:17,411 --> 02:00:21,940
game into a more of aggressive fighters
but wasn't that the death was very

2046
02:00:21,941 --> 02:00:26,530
controversial. Yeah. It
was uh, it wasn't suicide.

2047
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:27,850
Yeah.
It didn't seem like,

2048
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:31,420
it seems like it's really hard to do
a chin up from a shower curtain. Yeah,

2049
02:00:31,421 --> 02:00:35,160
he did. I mean, how can you, those
rods are not that strong. Yeah.

2050
02:00:35,890 --> 02:00:38,740
How's that? How can you even hang
yourself with one loss? Can you,

2051
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:43,750
he did the wrong keys.
He pissed off the wrong people allegedly.

2052
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:47,930
Yeah. Allegedly. Allegedly. Let's leave
it at that. What was it like in the,

2053
02:00:47,931 --> 02:00:49,390
in that day,

2054
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:53,290
like dealing with that
aspect of mixed martial arts?

2055
02:00:53,291 --> 02:00:56,500
Like it wasn't just mixed martial arts
like it is in the UFC where it's a

2056
02:00:56,501 --> 02:00:59,680
business and there's promoters
and there's, you know,

2057
02:00:59,681 --> 02:01:02,830
they have an agenda to try to promote
to the fans and try to make money.

2058
02:01:02,980 --> 02:01:07,980
But you are dealing with a very intense
organized crime mass spec to it.

2059
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:11,800
What was that like? It was
good. Good. That me? Yeah.

2060
02:01:12,100 --> 02:01:13,660
Because of who I was in the record,

2061
02:01:13,661 --> 02:01:17,940
the respect that I have from the other
people in Japan, it helped me to it.

2062
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:20,770
So I didn't take me wrong and
everything was straight up.

2063
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:25,270
Did they support Japanese fighters more?
They're like, what are they excited?

2064
02:01:25,271 --> 02:01:28,930
Their jar? Yes. They wanted the Japanese
first to win. Guys like Yoshida.

2065
02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:35,050
Well back in our day with some more
Sakuraba, some short g Matsui, you know,

2066
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:35,830
dog fighters.

2067
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:40,250
They wanted to promote those guys so they
when they're Takada Takotna was a pro

2068
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:43,090
wrestler. That was an
interesting situation too. Pussy.

2069
02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:46,580
Well he was a weird one because he was
one of the few guys that was in a very

2070
02:01:46,581 --> 02:01:49,610
obvious fixed fight.
His fight with Mark Coleman.

2071
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:53,120
I pull up that pull up to
Catia versus mark homer.

2072
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,760
Cause this is one of the few fights
that I love Mark Coleman and,

2073
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,110
but Mark Coleman never admitted
that he, he, he did that.

2074
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:04,030
But I'm sure that that's what happened.
Mark would never lose to icon.

2075
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:08,210
Well not that way either.
I mean the way tap to the heel hook,

2076
02:02:08,211 --> 02:02:11,350
it was total pro wrestling. I was like,
no, I don't want to, I don't want to tap.

2077
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:16,940
Tap. Yeah. Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah. It was like a movie.

2078
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:21,620
It was a weird, well TACAN does a fag.
He really, yeah, he's straight up.

2079
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:26,330
He's a fake. What is his background?
He's just a wrestler just but does,

2080
02:02:26,331 --> 02:02:29,150
he has marks on him on the street.
I saw him in, in a street incident.

2081
02:02:29,151 --> 02:02:30,830
He fagged out.
What happened?

2082
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:34,280
I was in a club and my friend was
a white students who were Ricky.

2083
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:38,150
Ricky Fukuda was, uh, the,
the um, security there.

2084
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:42,950
Sit here and he's like [inaudible]
like he's like punching him in the leg.

2085
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:46,850
You can see his punches.
Coleman sits at all in these punches.

2086
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:51,230
But then when he's not, it's the arm
punches. It's barely, barely punched him.

2087
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:54,740
And this was like back when Coleman
had won the heavyweight Grand Prix,

2088
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:58,550
right leg.
Like what is that about?

2089
02:02:58,551 --> 02:03:01,220
These leg punches I come on man.

2090
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:04,950
Mark Holman was not
about little bets if it,

2091
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,710
if you did put the leg it'd be heavy
punches. Everything he did was heavy.

2092
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:12,350
He was the godfather or ground and pound.

2093
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:17,210
And so he gets on top of him and he
gives up his leg here and look at this.

2094
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:21,020
I mean he has given up the leg here.
He rolls with a little bit

2095
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:26,900
and he see he is first of all to God is
not even, that's not even a heel hook.

2096
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:31,820
He's not even turning it. I mean
look at that. He taps but that,

2097
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:34,970
that you'll, it was a terrible
healer who wasn't even turning it.

2098
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:37,280
He was just holding it.
He was like,

2099
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:40,220
it didn't like the end
and a 10 step process.

2100
02:03:40,221 --> 02:03:44,200
He got to eight and then
just hung on at eight colon.

2101
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,580
Had a task screwed up cause
I'm not against purchasing,

2102
02:03:46,581 --> 02:03:50,230
but I am against purchasing being done
in the mixed martial arts or ring,

2103
02:03:50,430 --> 02:03:53,240
well wasn't that a weird
part of pride with that?

2104
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:57,560
There was a lot of pro wrestling
guys that fought in pride,

2105
02:03:57,770 --> 02:04:02,240
but a lot of them legit
guys whose diet butcher.

2106
02:04:02,610 --> 02:04:07,230
What was that? Uh, yeah,
that was tough. Top.

2107
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:11,930
Yeah. Very tough. And started
out as a pro wrestler. Yeah.

2108
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:14,390
And what was diet butcher?
What was that thing?

2109
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:18,140
The thing that he always had
on his pants that was his,

2110
02:04:18,141 --> 02:04:20,430
like his nickname I think.
Yeah.

2111
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,840
But it was the pro wrestling guys.

2112
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,020
We're the guys that had
brought a lot of fans,

2113
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:31,900
sort of like Brock Lesnar that
brought a lot of fans to watch fight.

2114
02:04:31,901 --> 02:04:36,630
Exactly. Yeah, that's true.
And Takotna was one of those
guys, right? He's a fake. So

2115
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:42,560
what was the, the street situation?
Well, Ricky, Ricky for Kudo is, uh,

2116
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:45,570
I was training with
him at the time and he,

2117
02:04:45,571 --> 02:04:48,480
I got him a job at a security
at a club that we hung out at.

2118
02:04:48,481 --> 02:04:53,481
So we went to the club and I remember at
the Caudal was there at the club and he

2119
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:57,930
said hi to me and stuff, you know, kind
of like this, like, Hey, what's up?

2120
02:04:58,110 --> 02:05:01,800
And that's it. And then I heard there
was like a big writer at the top.

2121
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,410
So I'm worried about Ricky
making sure that he's okay.

2122
02:05:04,411 --> 02:05:08,640
So I went upstairs to check on
it and it was just huge mob.

2123
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:13,670
They almost like a bs moving across
the street. And I was also who, uh,

2124
02:05:13,671 --> 02:05:16,020
who's fighting, I don't know who's
fighting someone, what's going on,

2125
02:05:16,021 --> 02:05:16,531
what's going on.

2126
02:05:16,531 --> 02:05:20,790
And I noticed some of the guys as a group
called the [inaudible] angle in Japan,

2127
02:05:20,791 --> 02:05:23,040
this is like a gang,
they're not yakuza,

2128
02:05:23,041 --> 02:05:27,510
but there aren't like the gang of kids
that don't give a fuck and they just get

2129
02:05:27,511 --> 02:05:30,960
into the beat people up.
I mean with bats and all kinds of stuff.

2130
02:05:30,961 --> 02:05:35,070
But I noticed a couple of them, I knew
who they are. So I went and followed the,

2131
02:05:35,190 --> 02:05:38,120
the thing to make sure that
everything was okay with Ricky Rick,

2132
02:05:38,121 --> 02:05:42,870
he's not involved in and everything.
And I went there and in the beehive,

2133
02:05:42,871 --> 02:05:47,220
when we get to the back,
one guy breaks free and it's a,

2134
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:52,221
it's this a rugby player and he's running
down when his face is all fucked up

2135
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:56,790
already and he's running down the street
and Takata's is running after him and

2136
02:05:56,791 --> 02:05:59,940
the kind of cc me and he goes hands and
help, they're going to kill us, help,

2137
02:05:59,941 --> 02:06:03,780
help and cause not touched his,
no scratches,

2138
02:06:03,781 --> 02:06:08,760
not a bruise on his face. And then
those guys, those guys ran by man,

2139
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,580
I'm, I'm still wondering what's
going on. Like whoa, shit, something.

2140
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:15,240
And they ran by me and they caught
up to the rugby guy, tackled them,

2141
02:06:15,630 --> 02:06:20,520
these gangsters tackle this rugby guy
had him and started working on again,

2142
02:06:20,700 --> 02:06:23,280
kicking him in the face, flower
pot on the head, everything.

2143
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:28,350
And you know what the is
doing. He standing on the
side screaming his lungs off,

2144
02:06:28,680 --> 02:06:33,060
stop it, stop it, stop it and not doing
anything about it. And he's fucking huge,

2145
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:36,950
giant dude not grabbing anybody.
He's not physically stopping in.

2146
02:06:36,951 --> 02:06:40,620
And he refused to physically get
involved and he sees me coming.

2147
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:45,520
He goes ends and stop, stop. I'll stop
them and like do this your friend. So I,

2148
02:06:45,521 --> 02:06:47,700
I click in my head thinking I can,
you know,

2149
02:06:47,701 --> 02:06:50,400
I can plague killed two
birds with one stone.

2150
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:52,980
I can help to Catia and I can
help these guys cause this,

2151
02:06:52,981 --> 02:06:55,260
this fight was going on for like
eight minutes or it, you know,

2152
02:06:55,530 --> 02:06:57,960
and the cops are probably on the way.
So think he's,

2153
02:06:57,961 --> 02:07:00,270
you guys got to guys get to get out
of here because the cops are coming.

2154
02:07:00,271 --> 02:07:01,620
So I'm grabbing these guys,

2155
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:06,300
throwing them in their van and as
I'm getting another guy, that guy,

2156
02:07:06,320 --> 02:07:09,040
that guy's coming out, it
was like ridiculous. Let's,

2157
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:12,480
let's try to get them in the car.
Five him got him in the car, got away.

2158
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,210
That got away right when the police
are coming. High speed chase,

2159
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:16,740
they actually got caught up the street,

2160
02:07:17,070 --> 02:07:20,880
put in prison and nothing from Takada.

2161
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:24,690
Not a thank you. Not a what's
up? Nothing from Tacoma.

2162
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:28,110
And I've had,
I haven't talked to him since that day.

2163
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:32,730
What does that got to do now? I don't
know. He does some acting. He acts.

2164
02:07:32,731 --> 02:07:36,040
That's good. He's probably better
at that than fighting. He was

2165
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,140
doing that in the ring was a little
bit of that. Yeah. So yeah, so I,

2166
02:07:39,141 --> 02:07:41,170
I have no respect for Takata at all.

2167
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:43,750
And if he comes up to me in
Japan and tried to shake my hand,

2168
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:46,180
I'm not going to shake his hand.
I'll tell before I shake your hand.

2169
02:07:46,220 --> 02:07:48,130
You just didn't. You have
somebody who say to me, cause he,

2170
02:07:49,150 --> 02:07:52,620
I saved them on that and he's just,
he's such a pussy and you know,

2171
02:07:53,130 --> 02:07:57,790
real upsetting for me to see him in the
ring at the pride in looking at Sylvan

2172
02:07:57,791 --> 02:08:01,460
sing. Are you a man looking at
rapids? Are you a man? Are you a man?

2173
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:05,800
Sing them like Xojane.
Yeah, he said in Japanese,

2174
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:10,360
he'll sing it like it was
about the tournament, I
think. Oh Man. Are you a man?

2175
02:08:10,361 --> 02:08:13,870
So the big theme was being
a man and I think God,

2176
02:08:13,871 --> 02:08:18,220
this is the biggest pussy asking
people if they're men. You know,

2177
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:19,750
I remember when he fought Hickson,

2178
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:24,670
Hickson just fucking worked
them. Yeah. That was,

2179
02:08:24,671 --> 02:08:27,940
I mean everyone who knew
how shitty Tacarla was new.

2180
02:08:27,941 --> 02:08:29,500
That ticks it was going to kick his ass.

2181
02:08:29,501 --> 02:08:33,900
But for the Japanese people it was huge
cause Takado was this to be a hero? Yeah,

2182
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:39,250
that was Hixon in the special time
to six and fought in the UFC. Man,

2183
02:08:39,690 --> 02:08:40,730
he's one of my biggest regrets.

2184
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:45,370
One of my biggest regrets is a fan is
that Hixon in his prime didn't fight all

2185
02:08:45,371 --> 02:08:48,280
the top guys like, oh, I would've
loved to seen Hixon vs Coleman.

2186
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,090
I would love to see in
Hixson versus a marked car.

2187
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,990
I would have loved to seen
him versus a lot of guys. Man.

2188
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:58,740
It could have been some amazing fights.
I mean we got to see him versus food.

2189
02:08:58,741 --> 02:09:01,930
Knocky who was legit for Nakia
was digital was the jet. Yeah.

2190
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:06,250
That was a good fight in Hickson got hurt.
He got a ruptured a orbital fractures.

2191
02:09:06,251 --> 02:09:10,640
Orbital in that fight. I swole up and
then he had to finish for Nakia for knock.

2192
02:09:10,641 --> 02:09:13,540
He just went to sleep and even tap
out and retired right after that.

2193
02:09:13,900 --> 02:09:15,930
I respect the shit out of that.
Yeah,

2194
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:21,030
I mean Hixon got on top of them and a
member he gift wrap that arm across and

2195
02:09:21,031 --> 02:09:23,940
he's holding onto his arm and just beat
him down and took his back and choked in

2196
02:09:23,941 --> 02:09:28,150
the sleep. That was an intense fight
and it was a real fucking fight. Yeah.

2197
02:09:28,151 --> 02:09:32,000
That was for Nike is good.
There was Hickson's last
fight too. Oh, was it? Yeah.

2198
02:09:32,140 --> 02:09:35,770
That was coliseum in 2000 2014 years ago.

2199
02:09:36,490 --> 02:09:41,140
14 years ago. And Hickson was still
talking about fighting years later when,

2200
02:09:41,141 --> 02:09:45,500
um, when fader was a, the
champ of pride, um, they,

2201
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:49,210
they x and wanted a lot of fucking money,
but he's still wanting to fight.

2202
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:53,620
He wanted to fight the best guys, but for
whatever reason, it never happened. Yeah.

2203
02:09:53,621 --> 02:09:54,101
Because,
uh,

2204
02:09:54,101 --> 02:09:57,550
I went to dinner with Hickson and his
wife and his family and his wife didn't

2205
02:09:57,551 --> 02:10:01,070
want him to do it. She didn't want him to
do it. But, uh, if they're separated, no.

2206
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:04,510
Yeah. But Hickson was like, ah, that's
the guy I would want to fight. Yeah.

2207
02:10:04,511 --> 02:10:05,344
This is the end.

2208
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:08,980
This is when Hickson was at his best and
I think Hickson was probably around 40

2209
02:10:08,981 --> 02:10:11,950
then. Yeah, he was. Yeah.
And he was, you know,

2210
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:17,500
still at his best. And he was big
too for this fight. He got muscular,

2211
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:20,770
probably the most muscular and the
strongest he got for any fight.

2212
02:10:20,860 --> 02:10:25,030
Cause Funai was no fucking joke man.
But he got his back and here it is,

2213
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:28,630
got that rear naked on and boom for Naca.
Just did you see him right there?

2214
02:10:28,631 --> 02:10:31,960
He's out.
He's just sitting there out fucking cold.

2215
02:10:33,690 --> 02:10:35,850
Yeah. Okay. Actually kicks him off.

2216
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:37,120
Okay.

2217
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:39,930
Yeah. And he's not an easy guy to
be choke out to fiction living.

2218
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:43,450
They made it look so easy and we
saw something special. I mean,

2219
02:10:43,451 --> 02:10:47,230
when you talk to all the different Jujitsu
practitioners that have trained picks

2220
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:50,050
and they, none of them come
away and go, yeah, yeah,

2221
02:10:50,060 --> 02:10:52,720
it's a lot of hype and none of
them, no, not a single one. Yeah.

2222
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:56,550
Every single one would talk about
Hixon saying he's the best. Yeah.

2223
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:59,820
Unbelievable. Yeah. You know, I,

2224
02:10:59,821 --> 02:11:02,800
I got to hang out with them one
night and talk positions with them.

2225
02:11:02,801 --> 02:11:07,630
And strategy and stuff like
that. Fascinating. Fascinating.

2226
02:11:07,631 --> 02:11:10,570
Fascinating. Watching a breakdown
fights too. I mean, we did tell him,

2227
02:11:10,571 --> 02:11:11,404
watching him fight,

2228
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:15,220
watching them watch fights with top guys
like Mario Sperry and stuff like that,

2229
02:11:15,221 --> 02:11:17,020
but just showing all
the holes in their game,

2230
02:11:17,021 --> 02:11:19,560
really showing all the things
they're doing wrong. Yeah.

2231
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:24,470
Six set up an elite of the elites,
you know,

2232
02:11:25,120 --> 02:11:27,880
I would've loved to got a chance
to roll with him, man. I got to,

2233
02:11:27,881 --> 02:11:30,580
but I was a white belt,
so yeah, everyone asks me,

2234
02:11:30,581 --> 02:11:33,280
did you get to road weeks of a yeah,
kind of. Yeah. Well, no you don't.

2235
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:38,680
He's saying I was a white belt
and he was, he was, uh, you know,

2236
02:11:38,681 --> 02:11:42,400
his kicks in and of course she's not
going to go hard on the white belt,

2237
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:45,730
so he kind of just roll with
us and beat us up and yeah.

2238
02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:50,580
So I didn't really get to feel
Hixson Hixson so I actually
in a way, kind of, no,

2239
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:55,570
not really. I did, but no, not really.
Yeah. Yeah. Even if I did, it would,

2240
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:58,270
might as well be me being a white belt.
It's the same thing.

2241
02:11:59,350 --> 02:12:02,420
That's what's really crazy. It's like I
try to tell people like there's a law,

2242
02:12:02,620 --> 02:12:04,230
there's levels of black belt,

2243
02:12:04,570 --> 02:12:07,390
like it could be a black belt and
then you roll it Marcello Garcia,

2244
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:08,860
and you could treat it like a white belt.

2245
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:12,500
It's you're still going to get strangled.
Yeah. There's guys that are just,

2246
02:12:12,501 --> 02:12:16,090
he lines up all the black belts in
Brazil and submit some will Hixon. Yeah,

2247
02:12:16,091 --> 02:12:18,070
so I heard he'd used to do every year,
I don't know about now,

2248
02:12:18,071 --> 02:12:19,390
but back in the day.
Yeah.

2249
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:22,720
He used to go to Brazil and line up
all the black belts and actually submit

2250
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:25,690
everyone one by one. Yeah,
he used to do that for sure.

2251
02:12:26,170 --> 02:12:30,190
He's got back problems now
though. Oh really? Yeah. He
looks good though, yet. Oh,

2252
02:12:30,191 --> 02:12:33,520
he's works out still and still
does yoga and he surfs a lot,

2253
02:12:33,521 --> 02:12:36,930
but he can't really train anymore.
It doesn't do Jujitsu. Yeah.

2254
02:12:36,970 --> 02:12:40,180
Crone was on the podcast and he said
that his dad has something like seven

2255
02:12:40,181 --> 02:12:43,120
herniated discs.
Yeah.

2256
02:12:44,490 --> 02:12:48,520
Does the issue, would you just two
guys, same thing with Brown. Yeah.

2257
02:12:48,521 --> 02:12:51,910
Ricardo Laborio. He's got like
seven herniated disc too. Yeah.

2258
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:56,200
All of them are holding out, sticking in
world spots of his body. Like Ricardo,

2259
02:12:56,201 --> 02:12:59,770
when you sit him see him standing there,
he's like, he's always in pain. Really?

2260
02:13:00,490 --> 02:13:03,280
He never fought MMA. Yeah,
he did. He did. Yeah.

2261
02:13:03,281 --> 02:13:08,281
Ricardo I think had one or two MMA
fights and looked fucking great.

2262
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:13,600
You want me to see it? Won't pull it off.
Ricardo Laborio I remember seeing him,

2263
02:13:13,601 --> 02:13:16,360
uh,
he did you doing Jujitsu seminars?

2264
02:13:16,361 --> 02:13:18,400
I would thought this guy would
be so good in him and me.

2265
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:22,390
He's a fucking beast is back
in the day, man. He was, yeah,

2266
02:13:22,391 --> 02:13:26,100
he had one fight and it was a
draw one fight. He fought me.

2267
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:28,990
Noah [inaudible] Noah. Yeah, yeah,

2268
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:32,243
yeah.
And

2269
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:35,880
he just defended a lot.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

2270
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:40,890
And it just a three round fight
went to a draw and that's it.

2271
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:44,460
I Dunno. I Dunno. I don't
remember much of that fight,

2272
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:49,680
but I just remember that at the time
a lot of people put him in the same

2273
02:13:49,681 --> 02:13:51,750
category as Hickson and he's like,
look,

2274
02:13:51,751 --> 02:13:56,160
we're caught and this is 2001 he had
that fight and the Barrio was very,

2275
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:58,490
very highly respected
amongst Jujitsu guys.

2276
02:13:58,510 --> 02:14:01,830
Like a lot of the guys that roll with
them. So he was just unbelievably good,

2277
02:14:02,310 --> 02:14:07,140
very tactical, very strong
technicals, bigs to solid guy.

2278
02:14:07,141 --> 02:14:10,770
If you saw him back in the Minoa,
he, he's fucking pull that fight up.

2279
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,180
Ricardo laborio versus Minoa.
Yeah.

2280
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:17,640
You could see how he looked at the
time. Oh, he's in incredible shape,

2281
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:21,730
but he's got a bunch of back problems
too, man. Wow. Really? Yeah. Yep.

2282
02:14:21,930 --> 02:14:23,580
Well he's still rose with all those guys.
You know,

2283
02:14:23,581 --> 02:14:27,840
he's the Co founder and the
head instructor at American
top team. So you know,

2284
02:14:27,841 --> 02:14:31,440
he's always there on a regular basis,
but he's still rolls with all those guys.

2285
02:14:31,530 --> 02:14:34,050
Wow. I think they had a, a,

2286
02:14:34,051 --> 02:14:38,700
a super fight of grappling Superfight
planned between him and Mario Sperry,

2287
02:14:39,180 --> 02:14:41,580
but I don't know if that's
still going to take place.

2288
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:43,920
But I had his back problems.
Well, I don't know.

2289
02:14:43,921 --> 02:14:46,710
I think he was still going to do
it even despite his back problems.

2290
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:49,740
How is Marsh Berry Day?
It's a good question.

2291
02:14:50,490 --> 02:14:54,900
I mean he was the head coach of the black
zillions and then for whatever reason

2292
02:14:54,901 --> 02:14:57,840
they had a falling out and he,
he wound up leaving the black zillions.

2293
02:14:57,841 --> 02:15:00,600
I Dunno what the fuck happened.
So I don't know where he is now.

2294
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:04,200
But he was an interesting, uh,
he was an interesting coach.

2295
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:08,460
They cleaned the Zanda they call
them, does that machines and yeah, uh,

2296
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,260
when I was first starting out,

2297
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:13,990
I started out at crossings
place in 1996. And, um,

2298
02:15:14,170 --> 02:15:18,270
Mario Sperry was there and Myra Sperry
was talking about how he got really good

2299
02:15:18,271 --> 02:15:22,740
at triangles by making his girlfriend
sit in his guard and he would just slap a

2300
02:15:22,741 --> 02:15:25,590
triangle on, on each side over
and over again. And she's like,

2301
02:15:25,591 --> 02:15:27,000
I don't want to do this anymore.
It's like,

2302
02:15:27,001 --> 02:15:31,140
shut up and just catch triangular
over and over and over again.

2303
02:15:31,141 --> 02:15:35,580
And he's just Kinda fucked up.
But he used her as a grappling dummies.

2304
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:40,590
Yeah. Here it is right here. Ricardo
Laboriel and Manila shaved his head.

2305
02:15:40,591 --> 02:15:41,424
That's right.
Yeah.

2306
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:47,070
This is way back in the day in 2001
and Minoa still fucking fighting.

2307
02:15:47,071 --> 02:15:51,930
Minoa is still going at it, but
no, it was fun. A lot of guys, man,

2308
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:54,210
huge bias as the big circus thing,

2309
02:15:57,100 --> 02:15:58,620
uh,
attacking each other here.

2310
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:04,220
It's interesting how there was a lot
of dudes that were heavy favorites,

2311
02:16:04,250 --> 02:16:08,300
like going into MMA and everybody
thought that Bob, these,

2312
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:13,220
this is going to be the next motherfucker
in MMA and like solid Libero,

2313
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:16,430
solid Houbara. A lot of people thought
like he was going to be the next Hickson.

2314
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:19,490
He's going to go into MMA and dominate
cause he was so good at Jujitsu,

2315
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:24,600
but it never quite panned
out. You know, that's the end.

2316
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:30,100
Even in Japan, uh, the judo

2317
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:32,890
guy said go into it. Yeah. She
was one of the most successful,

2318
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:37,360
but there was one after him that came
out. He, Hey, he keef on it here.

2319
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:40,600
I think he trained in Vegas.
Which guy? What's his name?

2320
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:45,460
He was like a gold medalist.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2321
02:16:45,461 --> 02:16:49,790
I know he lost to Yoshida later.
He came back in Japan in font.

2322
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:53,740
She didn't last, but not, not Maura. Um

2323
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:57,013
hmm.

2324
02:16:57,220 --> 02:17:00,150
Big Boy man. Let me see. I'll
pull up your sheet as career.

2325
02:17:00,210 --> 02:17:02,220
And he was raw aggressive in judo too.

2326
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,040
That's why they thought he was
going to be the next big thing.

2327
02:17:05,210 --> 02:17:10,010
Nakamura now Nakamura, he
lost too. He lost he sheet.

2328
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:14,200
Um, he's a he fought an Astra, Huh?

2329
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:19,960
No, it wasn't Ogawa. Oh God. I not
going out ago. It's new kid man.

2330
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:24,250
He didn't really do much, but
he was uh, he was up here.

2331
02:17:24,251 --> 02:17:29,140
I think he traded with Baroni
to, hmm. I Dunno. I'm looking
at his record. I forget.

2332
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:33,550
Is She, is she, I think, Oh,
is she? Yeah, he, she is, um,

2333
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:37,030
that's where I said till she is she, yeah,
that was the, in Japan that was like,

2334
02:17:37,060 --> 02:17:41,540
he was going to be the next huge
MMA guy, but never pans out. Well,

2335
02:17:41,541 --> 02:17:43,540
he fought him too young.

2336
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:48,520
He was just starting to get in
the MFS too many striking skills.

2337
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:52,250
I remember Yoshida fought tank Abbott
and head kicked him. Remember that? Yeah.

2338
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:56,320
Shana was pretty good.
Strike through don with Silva too.

2339
02:17:56,700 --> 02:18:01,060
It's a strong mother fucker, man.
He was a strong mother fucker. Yeah,

2340
02:18:01,061 --> 02:18:04,570
he sent some good fights. I was supposed
to be like the next big thing in Japan.

2341
02:18:04,571 --> 02:18:09,070
Them in May, but never turned
out. Yeah. Uh, is she, uh,

2342
02:18:09,071 --> 02:18:11,740
I think, I think that was
pretty cool in the states.

2343
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:15,130
I think he's training in the states
though, you know? Yeah. No, I think he is.

2344
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:19,750
He's a, I think he still has a,
he's still fighting MMA. Yeah.

2345
02:18:19,751 --> 02:18:23,140
I think he's still fighting. Yeah. Well
he fought in April. He fought, he won.

2346
02:18:23,590 --> 02:18:26,800
He beat, filled the freeze
fill the freeze. Who um,

2347
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:32,250
who fought in the UFC and before
that he beat Fujita in 2013.

2348
02:18:32,561 --> 02:18:35,740
I didn't know Fujita was still
fighting. Oh, I didn't know that either.

2349
02:18:35,920 --> 02:18:40,440
He fought in the A in Gnocchi.
A New Year's card. The
boom buy a car. Okay. Yeah,

2350
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:43,690
yeah, yeah. And before
that it'd be Jeff Manson.

2351
02:18:43,930 --> 02:18:46,180
He's won a bunch of fights
and already moved here too.

2352
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:50,830
He's trying to get residency. Oh really?
Cause a Japan judo won't take them back.

2353
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:56,020
Oh, I see. Flight doodle. He beat
Tim Silvia. He Beats Sean McCorkle.

2354
02:18:56,050 --> 02:19:00,610
He be Kerry shawl. He then he beat
Pedro his though Clayton Jones,

2355
02:19:00,611 --> 02:19:04,960
Jeff Monson Fujita and filled the freeze.
Those are all he's opponents,

2356
02:19:05,410 --> 02:19:09,940
so he's still working at it. You know,
he looked at his first fight in MMA.

2357
02:19:09,941 --> 02:19:14,530
That ever was Yoshida. Yeah.
Yeah, she does. Was just too
much of it. Too much. Yeah.

2358
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:17,080
Too much of a jump seat.
It was already adapted to MMA.

2359
02:19:17,560 --> 02:19:19,570
Is that a big part of fighting?

2360
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:23,440
Like that's something that you see in
boxing that I don't necessarily think you

2361
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:27,680
see in MMA as much as we're a
fighter is brought up correctly.

2362
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,370
Like they give them tests that
they can win and then you know,

2363
02:19:31,371 --> 02:19:35,540
they test them and then they graduate
for those tests in the UFC. No, right.

2364
02:19:35,990 --> 02:19:39,680
Not as much. There's a lot of guys
get fed to the dogs, like real early.

2365
02:19:40,010 --> 02:19:41,640
I mean like the Q f and stuff.

2366
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:44,780
Then you really gotta be good to
make it into that. Huh? The what?

2367
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:48,020
The two F that's house. Oh,
the Tuf the ultimate fighter.

2368
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:52,730
But I think that you're seeing now,
like I watch the ultimate fighter.

2369
02:19:52,731 --> 02:19:54,860
Sometimes you see guys
gas out really quick,

2370
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:57,470
you see kind of low level
striking and Jujitsu.

2371
02:19:57,500 --> 02:20:02,500
I think the talent pool is kind of dry
in a lot of ways in every now and then a

2372
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:05,920
new guy comes up like a Uriah hall who,
uh,

2373
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:09,120
who got on the ultimate fighter and
just knocking everybody out and look

2374
02:20:09,121 --> 02:20:09,921
sensational.

2375
02:20:09,921 --> 02:20:14,690
And you saw like real talent in
that guy and the guy who, uh,

2376
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:21,230
I mean, Dillashaw came from tough,
you know, and now he's a champion. Um,

2377
02:20:21,260 --> 02:20:21,501
just,

2378
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:25,580
I mean there's guys that have come from
the ultimate fighter who just won the

2379
02:20:25,581 --> 02:20:29,770
tough to this, the silver
sewn in one, that ball,

2380
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:33,590
he had no hair. Um, yeah,
that guy was good, Huh? Yeah.

2381
02:20:33,591 --> 02:20:35,480
I'm trying to remember his
name. Yeah, I forget his name.

2382
02:20:35,481 --> 02:20:36,560
There's so many of them now.

2383
02:20:36,620 --> 02:20:41,330
It's almost impossible to Calvin
gas alum who beat Uriah Hall,

2384
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:43,940
who's another super fucking
talented guy who came from that.

2385
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:47,930
But for every one of those guys,
there's like 10 guys that are just,

2386
02:20:47,960 --> 02:20:51,020
they're just not at the same level.
They're not because it's such a new sport.

2387
02:20:52,060 --> 02:20:56,880
[inaudible] has been around for
ages and so many boxes that there,

2388
02:20:56,920 --> 02:21:01,310
when you really think about it, high
level MMA is only 15 years old, you know,

2389
02:21:02,450 --> 02:21:04,190
really ab it.
Like we said,

2390
02:21:04,191 --> 02:21:07,250
Vito Belfort 97 so it's a little
bit a little bit older than that,

2391
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:12,251
but it's just so fucking crazy sport man
exploding growing thing right in front

2392
02:21:13,221 --> 02:21:15,850
of us. Can Imagine. I wonder what's
going to be like in 10 years though.

2393
02:21:16,070 --> 02:21:18,680
I can only,
I think when we look back at history,

2394
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:22,280
they look at the history and the growth
of mixed martial arts of martial arts

2395
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:23,030
period.
They'll,

2396
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:28,030
they'll see that martial arts grew more
in 20 years than it did in 20,000 years.

2397
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:32,540
It exploded out of nowhere and they
really figured out what works and what

2398
02:21:32,541 --> 02:21:34,520
doesn't work. But you know
what tripped me out is when a,

2399
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:39,530
when I first went to watch the UFC and
the Vegas and I saw the fighters pictures

2400
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:44,420
on the billboards is I couldn't believe
that. It's weird, right? I mean,

2401
02:21:44,421 --> 02:21:45,800
back in the day when
I used to go to Vegas,

2402
02:21:45,801 --> 02:21:50,090
we see like Donna Summers and
Kenny Rogers doing a concert,

2403
02:21:50,091 --> 02:21:54,050
but man,
the MMA fighters up on the billboards.

2404
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,420
It's like a total different level. Yeah,
it's wild, isn't it? Yeah. I love it.

2405
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:03,320
It's great. I mean, the bigger Amy May
gets, the better it is for me, you know,

2406
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:08,030
for sure. What do you plan on
doing in the future now? I mean,

2407
02:22:08,031 --> 02:22:11,540
you're making your bracelets and a, if
people want to buy those, by the way,

2408
02:22:11,541 --> 02:22:15,010
where can they get dusty for.com?
The book also is available so that again,

2409
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:19,680
destiny forever, destiny
forever.com. Yeah. Um, yeah,

2410
02:22:19,720 --> 02:22:20,880
making bracelets.
Uh,

2411
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:25,160
I'm doing the relief work is always going
to continue up north and I'm writing

2412
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:26,280
another book.
Second,

2413
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:29,970
second part. Do you think that you're
going to be involved in martial arts?

2414
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:35,140
Um, I'm not someone that's going to
try and promote or someone that's true,

2415
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:36,330
going to try and get involved.

2416
02:22:36,331 --> 02:22:39,670
But if there's anything that I can
do like it when people asked me to do

2417
02:22:39,671 --> 02:22:43,800
seminars, so to come and be involved
in something, I'm more than willingly.

2418
02:22:43,801 --> 02:22:46,680
You know, there's some kind of big
tournament of the, the Uga, right?

2419
02:22:46,681 --> 02:22:50,220
The underground forum.
What is it as a tournament?

2420
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:55,050
He has to have it though to have a
little little, um, like an amateur fight.

2421
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:59,620
Really? Yeah. I'm, I'm, I'm trying
to help with that too. Okay.

2422
02:23:00,340 --> 02:23:04,920
Pulls two winners like that, you know?
Oh, that's cool. Nice. I mean they given,

2423
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:07,230
even like when Dana comes to Japan,

2424
02:23:07,231 --> 02:23:09,480
I always offered him if
he ever needs my help,

2425
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:13,530
if he needs any help with anything
up there now that's awesome.

2426
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:16,680
While he's willing to help but to
be involved in that way, for sure.

2427
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:19,770
But what about like running a
school, running a gym? Again,

2428
02:23:19,771 --> 02:23:24,120
teaching fighters did that for
quite a while. Yeah. I, I'm not,

2429
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:27,810
I haven't been doing that actively
at my gyms. I've been doing seminars.

2430
02:23:27,811 --> 02:23:31,600
I just did one in New Zealand. I just
sweat and worked with the guys at a,

2431
02:23:31,601 --> 02:23:34,640
in Portland at fisticuffs.
Yes. Cool. Yeah.

2432
02:23:34,641 --> 02:23:38,030
So I'm doing that kind of stuff.
And I think I've,

2433
02:23:38,070 --> 02:23:41,540
I still have a lot to offer
to the fighters, but sure.

2434
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:46,260
On about doing it every day
and on teaching every day
and being stuck at a gym

2435
02:23:46,370 --> 02:23:50,220
at that, you know, 95 or even
like a every day at six to eight,

2436
02:23:50,221 --> 02:23:52,140
you're going to teach it.
I got to teach a class on,

2437
02:23:52,470 --> 02:23:57,110
I don't know if I will ever be able
to live in myself to that, but yeah,

2438
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:02,100
my life's exciting man. Traveled
all over trouble all over the world.

2439
02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:05,990
When you do these
seminars and uh, you, um,

2440
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:08,220
you sit down with young fighters,

2441
02:24:08,490 --> 02:24:11,720
how much of the seminar has to do
with mindset and how much the seminar?

2442
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:15,190
Half of it? Yeah, so what
I do is, um, for me, I,

2443
02:24:15,191 --> 02:24:18,240
I have the techniques to have on
the ground in real basic techniques,

2444
02:24:18,241 --> 02:24:20,250
stuff that worked.
Um,

2445
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:23,790
I think I have more to offer
into the mindset. Yeah.

2446
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:27,090
So mine is always like a
seminar. Slash. Philosophy.

2447
02:24:27,091 --> 02:24:31,920
So I will talk and then I'll show a
technique and then I'll ask him a question

2448
02:24:31,921 --> 02:24:33,710
and then I'll,
and you know like,

2449
02:24:33,711 --> 02:24:36,240
like one thing I asked
them that the New Zealand,

2450
02:24:36,241 --> 02:24:39,720
when I went to New Zealand did one in
New Zealand. I asked him, you know,

2451
02:24:39,990 --> 02:24:44,720
I asked him, well why do, why do fighters
tap? Like if I asked you that you why,

2452
02:24:44,730 --> 02:24:48,900
why do fighters tab? Because
they're afraid of injury. Yeah.

2453
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:52,020
And so they're essentially,
they've made a decision,

2454
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:56,110
I would rather not get my arm broken
and just admit defeat. That's,

2455
02:24:56,120 --> 02:24:57,180
that's in the lines of it.

2456
02:24:57,181 --> 02:25:01,290
But basically where a fighter taps is
because he's anticipating what he thinks

2457
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:04,950
is going to happen. It's an anticipation
of what you think is going to happen.

2458
02:25:05,570 --> 02:25:08,880
And that's why fighters tab,
you're anticipating your arm breaking,

2459
02:25:08,881 --> 02:25:11,560
you're anticipating going asleep.
And a lot of,

2460
02:25:11,561 --> 02:25:14,910
a lot of times people that the spectators
think it's because of pain because it

2461
02:25:14,911 --> 02:25:17,440
hurts. But a lot of
times it is a, you know,

2462
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:20,100
you don't harm partners and really hurt.
I mean, you can feel like I, you know,

2463
02:25:20,101 --> 02:25:23,380
y'all fuck my arm, my ligaments are going
to start stretching off. Fuck know. But

2464
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,930
it's not to that pain, that pain
level where you like how far I get.

2465
02:25:26,931 --> 02:25:29,620
So sorry I got a tap. You know that
you've even talks, it's not like you,

2466
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:32,090
you'd know it's this anticipating
what's going to happen, you know,

2467
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:36,170
and I kind of develop on that kind of
stuff. Like you know that kind of mindset.

2468
02:25:36,171 --> 02:25:37,000
Yeah.

2469
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,320
That there's a brief window where you can
pull victory out of the jaws of defeat

2470
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:45,460
by not having the mindset that
it's, it's, it's a focus here.

2471
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:51,510
How many of those moments happen where
a fighter like has that that door opens

2472
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:57,610
and either you can tap or you can push
forward and occasionally the guys put

2473
02:25:57,611 --> 02:26:01,900
forward and wind up winning doesn't some
of that, that's that gray area, right?

2474
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:06,930
That's that weird moment that do or die
moment that you feel like with the Jason

2475
02:26:07,690 --> 02:26:12,690
High type situation that the fighters
aren't allowed to express and push through

2476
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:17,170
it. Then I'll have to show how
tough they really are. Yeah.

2477
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:19,480
When guys talk to you
in seminars you have,

2478
02:26:19,481 --> 02:26:23,200
did they talk about specific fights and
ask you about specific moments in your

2479
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:26,090
career? Like what would one comes
up that you are fight come out?

2480
02:26:26,091 --> 02:26:29,200
Of course right before it comes up a lot.
What about the Randy fight?

2481
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:33,640
The Rodney fight, I'm not that much, but
it's always the one that's mentioned.

2482
02:26:33,641 --> 02:26:37,030
Yeah, it was a big victory. Yeah.
That was a huge victory for me. Yeah,

2483
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:41,350
that's like my claim to fame kind of,
you know, that kind of, that kind of put,

2484
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:46,390
you know, what was good about that was
that that victory made people accept that,

2485
02:26:46,391 --> 02:26:46,721
okay,

2486
02:26:46,721 --> 02:26:51,010
Anson is good and after I they need to
prove that I was good by getting wins.

2487
02:26:51,640 --> 02:26:55,870
So, so it kind of gave me that
window to fight with my heart.

2488
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:59,070
Know that I didn't need to pull out
the winds anymore, but back in the day.

2489
02:26:59,071 --> 02:27:03,760
But unless you pull out certain wins
you like, he's just a tough guy. Well,

2490
02:27:03,761 --> 02:27:06,610
that's a crazy thing about
you is not just your approach,

2491
02:27:06,611 --> 02:27:09,790
but your openness in
discussing that approach.

2492
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,500
The fact that you weren't necessarily
pursuing wins as much as you were trying

2493
02:27:14,501 --> 02:27:18,580
to find out about yourself.
That sounds like, you know,

2494
02:27:18,581 --> 02:27:21,520
that sounds like something that someone
would write about someone in a movie.

2495
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:25,480
And I mean like you wanted a white
about some crazy warrior and a movie.

2496
02:27:25,481 --> 02:27:27,790
You know, I'm not about
victory. I'm about, you know,

2497
02:27:27,791 --> 02:27:30,610
finding out the answers for myself.
Who am I as a man?

2498
02:27:30,810 --> 02:27:35,740
But that is really how you lived. Yeah.
And at the time it was stupid, but not,

2499
02:27:35,741 --> 02:27:39,670
no, but it's not. You say
at the time it was stupid.

2500
02:27:39,670 --> 02:27:42,850
I don't necessarily think it was,
it's definitely not stupid.

2501
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:45,010
Why didn't you do this?
She could have won the fight,

2502
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:48,760
but as a decision that you made the same
way Diego Sanchez makes those decisions

2503
02:27:48,761 --> 02:27:49,540
in a fight.

2504
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:54,540
The difference being is I think
Diego is just hardwired that way.

2505
02:27:55,330 --> 02:27:58,360
You know? I mean, maybe
you wore too in a sense,

2506
02:27:58,660 --> 02:28:03,660
but those things and those moments
define you in a lot of ways.

2507
02:28:03,941 --> 02:28:05,680
There's a lot of fighters from that era.

2508
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:09,940
But when people talk about
guys with a ferocious mindset,

2509
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,650
you're one of the ones
that always comes up.

2510
02:28:12,310 --> 02:28:16,190
And that's one of the reasons why
people want to see you at a seminar.

2511
02:28:16,191 --> 02:28:18,760
I want to talk to you,
want to hear you on this podcast.

2512
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:22,490
You know the funny thing about that
is that I had so many fears too.

2513
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:26,420
But you're open about that.
And like we talked about before,

2514
02:28:26,421 --> 02:28:29,660
you embrace those fears.
You, you face them head on.

2515
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:32,660
And that's one of the fascinating things
about you is that you were so willing

2516
02:28:32,661 --> 02:28:36,770
to discuss it, but honestly, no
fake tough guy. Bullshit, nothing.

2517
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:41,600
No bullshit man. No bullshit. Yeah.
Even the book is all real names, man.

2518
02:28:41,601 --> 02:28:44,510
Real incidents. Exactly as, as men.

2519
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:47,240
And I always live my life thinking that,
you know,

2520
02:28:47,241 --> 02:28:50,720
if I get punished for something that
I've done and I did it and they say the

2521
02:28:50,721 --> 02:28:52,280
right thing and I get punished for it,

2522
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:55,070
then let it be because that's
what's supposed to happen.

2523
02:28:55,640 --> 02:28:59,240
So if I get into trouble with stuff
that I wrote in the book is I'm not

2524
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:02,390
bullshitting. I'm not talking shit
about nobody. I'm not bullshitting,

2525
02:29:02,391 --> 02:29:03,380
I'm not exaggerating.

2526
02:29:03,381 --> 02:29:07,670
I'm just telling things as it is and if
I'm going to get in trouble for that,

2527
02:29:07,671 --> 02:29:12,350
then it was meant to be. Where can
people get stuck? Man? Same thing.

2528
02:29:12,351 --> 02:29:16,700
