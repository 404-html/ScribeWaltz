1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,000
The general experience.
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,300
That's the problem.
Those guys aren't woke once.

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:07,970
Everyone's all woke.
It'll be great.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,920
It's a dangerous word to use.
I feel like people got to mock it in the

5
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,420
future.
Woke woke.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,760
Yeah.
I felt like using woke now like

7
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:18,240
unironically super slippery.
I see a trap coming.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,730
You do.
The jujitsu practitioner in me is like,

9
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:22,860
I don't like this move.
This is a.

10
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:27,750
I know where this leads.
That's how I feel.

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,370
I see that woke thing.
I'm like,

12
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,390
what are you woke?
What the fuck does that even mean?

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,450
I don't look up.
You woke up.

14
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,130
What do you 12?
Well,

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,260
it comes from my 16 year old,
so yeah,

16
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,160
it's kids today.
But what does it mean?

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,640
It means your brain is open.
You're open to stuff.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,760
The problem is there's no real
quantification.

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,960
There's no real.
There's no test you take to show that if

20
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:52,630
you're woke.

21
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,463
Right?
Right.

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,650
Like if you want to be a mathematician,
you have the fucking show that you know

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,880
how to do math.
The professor said,

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,400
check your work.
Like you get through like,

25
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:03,750
yes,
congratulations Tom.

26
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,890
Papa.
You are a mathematician.

27
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,140
Phd In mathematics,
it says right here on the paper and

28
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:09,871
you're like,
God damn it,

29
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm going to put this shit on my walls.
You understand?

30
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,090
I know how this stuff works.
Yeah,

31
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,280
but wokeness,
anybody can claim to be a master of

32
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:19,290
wokeness.
It's like Kung Fu without fighting.

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,750
It's very dangerous.
Yeah.

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,540
No one's defined what's woke and what's
preposterous.

35
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,620
No one's defined what's,
what's just not racist and sexist and

36
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:31,230
not homophobic,
but open minded and aware of the,

37
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,660
the,
the failings and the misgivings of all

38
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:36,280
sides of us and with no bias.
Right.

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,050
Is that.
Well,

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,850
because it doesn't seem like it is.
Isn't that woke?

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,760
I don't know.
I don't think so.

42
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,790
I think you just described what I
thought it was.

43
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,860
I would like that,
but too many people could jump in.

44
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,790
There's no.
There's no real clear understanding of

45
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:51,170
like what makes an constitutes someone
being woke like.

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,890
Yeah.
How many of those boxes do you have to

47
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,080
check where it was like,
stop Tom.

48
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,200
Papa had a woke academy and you took
these people.

49
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,080
It would just mean to you like bread or
bread claiming wokeness super slippery.

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,130
What's his Jamie?
62 New York Times magazine or

51
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,590
crazy gotta.
Dig It.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,470
Look,
if you're woke,

53
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:17,010
you dig it.
Almost the perfect definition right

54
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,870
there.
If you're woke,

55
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,730
you dig it.
That is insane.

56
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,890
That was my fox man.
And you were copying my taste and grit.

57
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
Don't jump salty on me.
Whoa.

58
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,020
Look how they talked back then they were
trying to talk people into talking the

59
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,790
way that made them seem more
interesting.

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,580
I'm going to say it the way I would say
that if I lived back then.

61
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,430
Hey,
make it bigger so I can see why you'd be

62
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:43,040
the guy on the left.
Jamie.

63
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,390
No,
no,

64
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,270
no.
Scrolling.

65
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,420
So we could read the comments.
What he's saying.

66
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:49,051
Up Top.
Yeah.

67
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:50,040
Okay.
That was,

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,610
that was my facts man.
And you were coding grace and grit.

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,900
So how would you say that now?

70
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,090
That was my fox man.
Maybe cop in my taste.

71
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:07,360
And of course it's girl on girl.
And you're saying no,

72
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,500
that's what they said.
Oh,

73
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,270
would you use.
What words would you use today?

74
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,163
Yeah.
Yeah.

75
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,570
He would say the fuck he doing with my
girlfriend.

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,180
Dickhead.
And he said,

77
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,700
don't jump salty on me.
I would say,

78
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,740
hey,
we're cool.

79
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,540
No worries,
no worries.

80
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,730
Stop being such a bitch.
It's all good.

81
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,960
It's all good.
Yeah.

82
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:27,130
And then it'd be like,
what?

83
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,490
Someone's a bitch.
And then next thing you know,

84
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,760
people will be hitting each other.
That's the darkest snowman.

85
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,140
I think what you're saying is one very
important point that we need to move

86
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,950
past the military gatekeepers of tech.

87
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,210
No
big tech which are at advertising

88
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,500
agencies in social media,

89
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,960
the things that are constantly
predicting your next purchase,

90
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,511
right?
Yeah.

91
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,640
Because if you think,
if you think about it,

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,880
and I'm in even in a semi democracy look
like we have in the US,

93
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,580
I mean those who control the
brainwashing of the public in essence

94
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,170
control who votes for what and who
controls the brainwashing of the public

95
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,520
is advertising agencies and who
increasingly are the biggest advertising

96
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,430
agencies are,
are the big tech companies who are

97
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,820
accumulating everybody's data and using
it to,

98
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,170
to program their minds to buy things.
So this is what's programmed the global

99
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,010
brain of,
of,

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,700
of the human race.
And of course there are close links

101
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,780
between big tech and the military.
Let's look at.

102
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,570
Amazon has $25,000 person headquarters
in Crystal City,

103
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:42,090
Virginia right next to the Pentagon.
And in China it's even more direct and

104
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,300
unapologetic.
Right?

105
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:48,301
So it's a new military industrial
advertising complex,

106
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,360
which is guiding the evolution of the
global brain on the planet,

107
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,380
which that with this past election,
right,

108
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,760
with all the intrusion by foreign
entities trying to influence the

109
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:06,680
election that they've,
these giant houses set up to write bad

110
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,580
stories about whoever they don't want to
be in office.

111
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,780
Yeah.
In a way that's almost a red herring,

112
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,020
but it,
I mean the Russian stuff is almost a red

113
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:21,250
herring.
But it revealed what the processes are,

114
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,840
which,
which are used to program.

115
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,110
Oh,
because I think the whatever programming

116
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:31,111
of the American's minds is done by the
Russians is minuscule compared to the

117
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,540
programming of Americans' minds by the
American American corporate and

118
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,330
government elite.

119
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,480
Not that anybody's even jumping in as
well as African elite.

120
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,980
So my dad,
my dad dance limbo,

121
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
right?
My Dad was the baddest limbo dance on

122
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,550
the planet.
Really.

123
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,400
And he did some crazy,
crazy stuff.

124
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,740
You might need to try it again.
It didn't.

125
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,210
I think.
Oh,

126
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,330
probably when I closed my phone.
Okay.

127
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,760
There we go.
Waiting for Jamie to grab it and I'll

128
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,320
leave it open.
I'm no,

129
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,640
my dad used to dance limbo and I'm limos
when you go onto the stick.

130
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,870
Yes.
Yes.

131
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
And um,
he,

132
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,810
I don't wanna I don't to ruin it.
Right.

133
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,850
But he was the best jokes from like 88,
like the year before he died.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,713
Wow.
Yeah.

135
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,830
So like,
I dunno,

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,930
it just reminds me of some of the thing
and my family.

137
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,940
Anytime I did something that I thought
was cool,

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,160
they would just be like,
yeah,

139
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,880
like,
so wait,

140
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,640
your dad,
your dad would do that was like,

141
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,370
fuck,
like I could never get out of his

142
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,110
shadow,
but this is your dad.

143
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,070
That's my dad.
Oh,

144
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:42,530
shit was fire.
Yeah.

145
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,390
Damn,
how the fuck is he doing that?

146
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,560
That is insane.

147
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,190
That's insane.
Yeah.

148
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,000
He did this for like tons of.
If you did it from everybody wanted to

149
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,670
see him do this.
He did it in front of Mandela.

150
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,920
Did in front of the queen know if he's
going to go under it there.

151
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,620
Yeah.
But it gets better than this whole lot.

152
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,940
Do you eat the fuck is he doing that?
You don't.

153
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,761
Kind of.
Core strength.

154
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:08,750
That takes blown far.
But this right here now this is where it

155
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,150
gets ridiculous.
This is like,

156
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,110
I see this and I'm like,
yeah,

157
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,080
that's my dad.
Like he's going to go what?

158
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,580
So this is on fire folks in this.
This thing is I'm not bullshitting.

159
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,110
And he's got to flaming pizzas in his
hand and he's like that.

160
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,380
That might be what?
13,

161
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,330
14 inches off the ground and he's going
under it.

162
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,780
That's insane.
And he spit and fire while he's doing

163
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,614
it.

164
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,660
Holy Shit.
You weren't joking?

165
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,310
No,
my dad was a bad ass.

166
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,920
That's crazy.
How crazy they are looking at this old

167
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:44,210
vhs footage digitized.
It's not that long ago,

168
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,020
man.
No,

169
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,560
and that's a different world and that,
that,

170
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,760
that kind of thing.
My Dad Kinda.

171
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,730
I mean I was always with.
I used to love being with him.

172
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,810
You know,
he's like my best friend.

173
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:55,820
I remember I was telling my son this
story about him,

174
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,660
so I had this thing with my kid and I'm
recording this conversation with me and

175
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:01,700
my son and I'm like,
what would you do if you go back in

176
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,140
time?
And he's like,

177
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:03,621
what?
I was like,

178
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,940
if you had a time machine you can go
anywhere,

179
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,780
where would you go?
He's like,

180
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,520
I don't know,
the 19 hundreds.

181
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,750
And I'm like,
I grew up in the 1900,

182
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,480
what are you talking about?
Like last week.

183
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,630
And then I told him the story.
I was like,

184
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,560
yeah,
remember I was little.

185
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,690
My Dad used to,
I used to bring you on stage to do that.

186
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,090
I was like four or five years old.
No,

187
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,760
I was like four years old and he would
pick me up and carried me under the,

188
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:26,630
under the bar.
Right.

189
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,250
And one time he brings me on stage.
He's like,

190
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,260
this is my son.
And he presents me in the spotlight's on

191
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,610
me and I'm shy.
And I'm like,

192
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,260
oh.
And he was kind of disappointed,

193
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,780
really disappointed me that day.
And then,

194
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,940
um,
a couple of weeks later I was with him

195
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:38,774
again.
He's like,

196
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,500
I was like,
Daddy,

197
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,220
you bring it back on stage and he brings
me on stage and um,

198
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,230
he's about to pick me up and I'm like,
I could walk away and I go back to my

199
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:48,690
seat.

200
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,790
I did.
He loved it.

201
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,740
He loved it.
You know what I told my son that story.

202
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,180
My Dad was like,
he people afterwards,

203
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,780
we walked through the hotel to go back
and he has me on his shoulders and he's

204
00:08:55,781 --> 00:08:56,521
just so proud.
He's like,

205
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,960
you see my boy and he's like,
you know,

206
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,040
I told my son about that and my son was
like,

207
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,110
it was like 40 minutes later in the
conversation and my son is like that.

208
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,900
If I had a time machine,
I'd go back and hang out with you when

209
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,520
your dad was like,
that was like,

210
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,520
that was like the best moment of my
life.

211
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,400
Message it.
That's done.

212
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,600
You examine your fucking brain and that
takes some hard work and suffering.

213
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,270
If you're not really do that.
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,670
And it seems like there's no way to do
that as a bystander.

215
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,380
You can't watch it,
man.

216
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,240
You got to get out there and like,
oh,

217
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,610
this hurts,
this hurts real fucking bad.

218
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,870
I don't think this is smart.
And then guess what happens?

219
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:38,910
The body will just,
it will adjust if it goes well.

220
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Then the next question again,
but time when it doesn't adjust to I

221
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:48,920
guess some of the stupidest shit man,
like don't,

222
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,380
don't take with a grain of fucking salt
people.

223
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,150
Those questions that people that are
wanting to quit.

224
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,013
Yes.
Yes.

225
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,780
And that's what I say.
When should I quit that?

226
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,890
God.
Did you ever like feel like no,

227
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,840
shut the fuck up.
Stop.

228
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,100
Stop.
I don't want to like that.

229
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,120
There's always that next question.
No,

230
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,160
don't take it.
Like go out there and run through a

231
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,600
brick wall.
So many times you can.

232
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,630
No,
I'm not saying be me.

233
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,500
Don't run towards you.
And five miles at one time.

234
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,040
I'm not saying do that.
I'm saying start to learn.

235
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,310
The mind is powerful.
It's powerful,

236
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:20,910
man.
It's unbelievable.

237
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,720
But people need,
they need a thing to get them going.

238
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,280
Right?
They need a thing,

239
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,690
right?
I need a goal.

240
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,660
They need.
They need A.

241
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm like,
it's sometimes the first step is the

242
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,800
hardest.
It's hard to take that 1 million,

243
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,350
step two,
but sometimes the first step is the Mo

244
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,230
is something about the,
what do I do?

245
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,130
They start going over their phone and
start calling people.

246
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:49,131
They don't get out of the house and
there's something about procrastination.

247
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,661
So like,
you know,

248
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:54,240
it's painful.
You know you should be doing things,

249
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,650
but you just keep doing it.
You keep itching that

250
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,430
I procrastinate like a motherfucker man.
Every day I want to do this shit.

251
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,030
That's what's so funny,
man.

252
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:10,000
People looking like on some damn
superhero that came down from the Gods,

253
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,040
from the heavens and earth.
No Man,

254
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,460
I don't want to do this shit.
I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes.

255
00:11:18,341 --> 00:11:21,700
Sometimes they can fuck man.
People.

256
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,190
People look up to your Goggins fucked
him.

257
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,883
I'm like,
Oh,

258
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,290
do this shit man.
What do you do it?

259
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,380
I'm going to do it as long as you do it
and that's what I know about it.

260
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,580
That's why I stopped doing it.
I'm thinking,

261
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,230
Oh man,
you gonna fucking sit here and you look

262
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:37,730
at your shoes for 30,
40 minutes.

263
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,850
You Go,
you gotta think about all day long you

264
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:43,040
go do it anyway.
And sometimes you don't have the time to

265
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,050
look issues for 30 minutes.
Those are the,

266
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,700
those are the beautiful days.
Yes.

267
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:47,241
It's,
you know,

268
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,650
you just have to go.
That's right.

269
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:51,450
And so like there's no room for
procrastination and that's when I,

270
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,700
when I was in the military,
I love my because I knew it'd be work at

271
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:57,940
7:00.
So you got to get your ass up at 4:00.

272
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,000
Marissa get your shit in brother,
because I had to get my shit and before

273
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,590
I got my shit in know.
So that was my mentality back then.

274
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,580
Manual.
Like I,

275
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,040
I had to get the miles and get
everything in man and,

276
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,660
and get to work.
Man.

277
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm a competing with the Alpha males.
