Yeah.

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,260
What are they doing it?

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,300
We don't live forever.

This is where we make love.

59
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,410
I want blah,

60
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:08,910
blah.

61
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,050
We're also brought to you by [inaudible].

62
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,510
I'm ting is a mobile cell phone
company that uses a sprint backbone.

63
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,410
And uh,

64
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,700
I don't know how they did this.

65
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:20,610
I don't know if it was like
other people have had this idea.

66
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,170
Are there people who have
done things like this before,

67
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,720
but what they decided to do was,

68
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,590
I guess they rent,

69
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,370
they rent time on the sprint backbone
and they sell it back to you.

70
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,320
And the way they do it is they have their
company setup in a way that it makes

71
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:34,500
it.

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,910
Like if you were gonna like,

73
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,040
I wish my company did this,

74
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,380
I wish my company had no contracts.

75
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:44,760
I wish my company would
refund money if I didn't use,

76
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,270
uh,

77
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,580
the,

78
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:45,830
the,

79
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,011
the,

80
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:50,220
the minutes credit on unused service if
you use less than you thought you would,

81
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,110
tear drops you down and credits you
the difference on your next bill.

82
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,420
So I've never heard of
a company doing that.

83
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,410
It's beautiful.

84
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,440
I love hearing that Shit.

85
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,150
Unlimited devices on one plan.

86
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,660
You can have as many devices on you want
on one plan and you can share pooled

87
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,680
minutes messages and megabytes.

88
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,980
And each device has a plan on a plant,

89
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,020
costs a flat fee of $6 per month.

90
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,490
It's like it's beautiful company.

91
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,270
Um,

92
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,250
they also have the best android phones.

93
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:22,540
You can buy really cool ones
like the Samsung Galaxy note too,

94
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
which is that giant fucking delicious one
kid's screen envy every time I see it.

95
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,040
So pretty bad ass looking foam.

96
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,630
They have the galaxy s three.

97
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,040
I think they're getting the s four.

98
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,180
That's how is that out yet?

99
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,900
The s four?

100
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,733
Not quite out yet.

101
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,911
It's not out.

102
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:37,744
It's on the way out.

103
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,280
They keep pumping these out,

104
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:39,551
man.

105
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:39,701
It's.

106
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:43,570
It's really interesting because they
really have lit a fire under apple's ass

107
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,230
because for the longest time there was
no benefit to having any device other

108
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,890
than an iphone.

109
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,690
I had that touch screen blackberry because
I was trying to stick with verizon.

110
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,531
Oh my God.

111
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,580
What a piece of shit.

112
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,210
That was.

113
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,870
What a wretched clunky
clicky piece of shit.

114
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,260
You're in Austin now.

115
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:02,870
You weren't in denial because
you still might hate it.

116
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,570
I just liked verizon.

117
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:05,110
I used,

118
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,540
back then I used phones more.

119
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,280
I used my phone to make calls.

120
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,970
I was very,

121
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,190
very little texting and never online,

122
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,580
so for me it was just important
that I could use it to,

123
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,350
you know,

124
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,200
to call people.

125
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,840
But then it was just too,

126
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,690
it was too hard.

127
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,170
He would try to get
your email or something.

128
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,670
It was a fucking joke to try to
write an email and that click,

129
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,001
click,

130
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:25,330
click,

131
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:25,661
click.

132
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,500
Every time you touch it,

133
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,050
click,

134
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,351
click,

135
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:27,640
click,

136
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
click,

137
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,801
click,

138
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,634
click.

139
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,310
So Tonka Shits and you know,

140
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,510
you just see would look at the iphone,

141
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,350
you'd feel sad.

142
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,460
But that's not the case anymore.

143
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,870
These new phones are actually,

144
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:39,130
they have benefits over the iphone.

145
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,800
The biggest one being a screen
screens are fucking huge.

146
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:42,551
The galaxy s three,

147
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,280
the one that I have,

148
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,230
it's beautiful.

149
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,320
And if you look at a website and it's
such a different experience and looking on

150
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:51,340
a website on my phone and the note takes
it to the next level of known as like

151
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,121
five inches.

152
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,310
It's fucking gigantic like me

153
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,520
snipped in on your lads.

154
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,240
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,

155
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,660
you save yourself 25 bucks
on either a device or um,

156
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,791
or,

157
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,440
or credit for service as well.

158
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,350
So the 25 bucks is
applicable to either one.

159
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,910
It's [inaudible] dot ting.com.

160
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,700
And again,

161
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,070
really great phones,

162
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,720
really great ethical company.

163
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,563
It just,

164
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,671
it all works,

165
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,181
bitches.

166
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,890
It's beautiful and delicious.

167
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,570
So go team for business.

168
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,404
I'm going with that is

169
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,070
probably something good.

170
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,990
They probably have better,

171
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,520
bigger plans or something.

172
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:30,811
Yeah.

173
00:05:30,811 --> 00:05:32,440
We're also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com.

174
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:37,240
That's o n n I t if you haven't seen
the chimp kettlebells are out there,

175
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,900
uh,

176
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,350
the first of this new thing that
we're doing called primal bells.

177
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,830
And what we've done is a hire artists to,

178
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,460
um,

179
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,210
create,

180
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:46,510
uh,

181
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,343
these,

182
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,650
these images to create
sculptures of angry chimpanzees.

183
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,050
One of them we've got,

184
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:54,280
I don't want to give away,

185
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:55,450
I already gave away the gorilla,

186
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,210
the gorilla.

187
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:56,741
So dope.

188
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,800
I couldn't keep it together.

189
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,540
But there's,

190
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,750
there's a bunch of really cool ones
we have coming out and it's all,

191
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,190
they're all designed by someone
who does special effects models.

192
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,293
They do like,

193
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,750
you know,

194
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,410
monsters,

195
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,490
monster movie type Shit.

196
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,020
So we hired him to make a Kettlebell.

197
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,960
We also three d scanned it to
make sure that it's totally,

198
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,130
completely balanced.

199
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,370
The problem with these sort of joke
workout pieces of equipment is,

200
00:06:20,371 --> 00:06:21,710
and then they look great,

201
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:23,960
but they're not as
effective as the real thing.

202
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,720
These are as effective as
any kettlebell you get.

203
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,490
You have to watch which way your hand it.

204
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,553
Um,

205
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,620
handle it so that the chimp
face as a slam in your arm.

206
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,581
But even if it did,

207
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,414
it's okay.

208
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,720
I've,

209
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,100
I've used them both ways.

210
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,420
It's not that big of a deal,

211
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,520
especially if you're a
manly man like myself,

212
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,570
but the point is that it's
their excellently bounced.

213
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,810
We had unbalanced absolutely perfectly
with really thick handles too.

214
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,040
So it's really difficult to use,

215
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,571
which is what you want.

216
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,910
You want something to
really work your grip in.

217
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,750
If you've never had any kettlebell
exercise in your life before,

218
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,370
I urge you to find a trainer and
have someone show you in person.

219
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,300
If you can afford that,

220
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,163
if you can't,

221
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,690
there's a lot of online videos.

222
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:06,540
But,

223
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,040
um,

224
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,480
if you go to like youtube,

225
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,021
there's many,

226
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:09,201
many,

227
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:09,411
many,

228
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,390
many online instructional
that you can get for free.

229
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,630
But you want to really be
diligent about your form.

230
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,020
You really want to be diligent
about your actual fitness level.

231
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,920
Don't push yourself too quick and hurt
yourself and you don't lift too much

232
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:22,754
weight too easily,

233
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,480
just in the beginnings or too
quickly rather than beginning.

234
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,230
Try Light,

235
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,890
lighter weights.

236
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:28,723
Try just,

237
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,110
you know,

238
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,520
you're just trying to
build slowly every day.

239
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,050
Just write it down.

240
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,070
Make yourself do it.

241
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:36,050
If you really want to get in shape
and if you really want to work hard,

242
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,460
don't go all at once.

243
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:39,080
That's crazy because
when you go all at once,

244
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:40,100
you break things.

245
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,810
You fuck up your muscles,

246
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,830
you pull things,

247
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,191
your hurt,

248
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,024
your knees.

249
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,871
Don't do that.

250
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:47,780
You gotta you gotta train if you're going
to train hard and you should have been

251
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,190
training hard for years already,

252
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,450
and so the.

253
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:55,451
The idea behind a functional fitness
like kettlebells or steel maces or steel

254
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:56,151
clubs,

255
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:56,651
these clubs,

256
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:57,200
bells,

257
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
all these different things that we
sell is the idea of using things using

258
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:06,560
workout equipment that provides you
with functional real world strength.

259
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,400
So if you're in the mountains
and a mountain lion jumps
and you managed to get a

260
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:12,530
hold of his neck,

261
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,680
how confident are you in your endurance?

262
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,280
How long can you fight
this motherfucker off?

263
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,920
Is it a difference between life or death?

264
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:22,910
In some situations,

265
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,940
most likely the mountain lions can fuck
you up unless you have some sort of a

266
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,410
knife or he's a pussy.

267
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,810
Could get lucky and find some pussy ass
mountain lion that maybe got fucked up

268
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:36,020
by a bear a couple of weeks ago and it
still doesn't have a stage legs back

269
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:36,680
under them.

270
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,513
PTSD,

271
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,433
PTSD.

272
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,300
Some woman got attacked by
a wolf recently in Alberta.

273
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,130
Fucking crazy shit.

274
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,720
She had these bite marks on her neck,

275
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:48,860
but there was a bunch of people around.

276
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,780
So apparently the wolf flutter go big.

277
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,890
Two hundred pound Timberwolf just took
this lady down and bit her neck and a

278
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,540
bunch of people around there and people
were freaking out because there were so

279
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,740
many people and people were freaking out.

280
00:08:58,741 --> 00:08:59,970
The wolf just bailed,

281
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,220
but he got so bold and so scary that he
jumped on this chick and the chick just

282
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:07,170
got in her car and drove to the hospital.

283
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,060
It's a crazy story,

284
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:09,820
man.

285
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,370
Wolf let go of her neck.

286
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,070
I mean,

287
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,060
she's got these cuts,

288
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,130
like there's images of it.

289
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:15,180
You could find it online.

290
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:16,290
There's images of her neck.

291
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,180
She got off relatively lucky.

292
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,310
She's lucky it was on wolf a pack.

293
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,410
Well,

294
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,120
I think if it was a lone wolf,

295
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,440
it's also positive possible.

296
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,890
That's why it was so fucking hungry
that got kicked out of the pack.

297
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,910
Like if it's a big old male,

298
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,310
you know,

299
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,050
it might be that it's on its way out
and some new mail took over and now he's

300
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,471
fucked.

301
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:35,430
He's out there by himself.

302
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,690
That's how they die.

303
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,921
That's a.

304
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:38,670
that's a.

305
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,980
that's an exile on the wolf world.

306
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,600
That's a fucking terrible,

307
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,434
terrible thing.

308
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,910
Those,

309
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,230
I mean,

310
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,270
they're essentially saying,

311
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:46,410
we've got no room for any anymore,

312
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:46,711
dude.

313
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,200
You gotta you gotTa
fucking kick the bricks.

314
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,170
As poor wolf's got to go out
and try to get some elk himself.

315
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,630
It's hard for one both to kill an elk.

316
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,410
You got to get a gang of them and you've
got no fucking box them in and take

317
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,040
them out by the legs and look
for the little ones and you know,

318
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,540
but those wolves on their own man,

319
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:03,991
this bit,

320
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,824
this chick's neck.

321
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,330
Well maybe if the bitch Nigga little
Jujitsu and had some kettlebell training,

322
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,080
she could fight off that Pussy Wolf
that will obviously it was a pussy.

323
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,140
You know,

324
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,710
if they're like bites in
the neck and then he's like,

325
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,400
fuck.

326
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,450
He got that close.

327
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,351
He got that close.

328
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:20,250
You're not going to try to eat her.

329
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,033
You know,

330
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,220
are we talking to dating now?

331
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,210
Are still with the wolves?

332
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,620
Okay Dude,

333
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,530
you can't say them on the podcast podcast.

334
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,790
We're talking about defending yourself.

335
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,624
Get Wolves

336
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,030
now by a wolf.

337
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,560
What if they were the best at it?

338
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,840
What if I get super dangerous?

339
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,200
You know,

340
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,760
every now and then someone
got their pussy bit,

341
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,020
but for the most part,

342
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:41,610
like orgasms by Wolf,

343
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,361
eating your pussy.

344
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:43,470
He's like the greatest thing ever.

345
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,990
It's put their snout in there.

346
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,360
It's a really muscular tongues and
that they're not scared to get dirty.

347
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,673
You know,

348
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,510
I don't know if this is appropriate,

349
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:56,511
but when I heard a lot of stories about
women who are menstruating camping and

350
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:02,340
the blood attracted grizzly bears and you
gotta be really careful camping with a

351
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,210
woman who's been destroyed.

352
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,810
God and what are the bare
decides that you're a pussy for?

353
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,820
That's what they do and they
find the one with that missing.

354
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,980
Oh my God,

355
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,270
that's so scary.

356
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,380
It's not a good image.

357
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,730
That's such a scary animal.

358
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,470
The scariest thing about them,

359
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:21,090
we've talked about this
in the podcast before,

360
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,500
but is that they don't kill you.

361
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,334
They just started eating.

362
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,800
Some animals will kill you first.

363
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:26,071
Well,

364
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,030
that's a black bear.

365
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,140
No.

366
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,980
Even Grizzlies,

367
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,970
they don't kill you.

368
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,230
They will kill you eventually,

369
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,520
but they start eating you.

370
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:32,880
They don't.

371
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,240
They don't have that instinct like a
panther does to bite your neck and stop

372
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:40,020
your life and then consume you and they
don't do that because for two reasons.

373
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,870
One thing is probably because
they're so fucking big and powerful.

374
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,940
It's like they don't really
have any enemies like,

375
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,170
besides man,

376
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:46,680
right?

377
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,090
So they don't feel like once they got.

378
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:48,181
Yeah,

379
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,620
they just take the time and eat,

380
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,390
you know,

381
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:53,500
and they're so strong that like
a deer can't really hurt them,

382
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:53,890
you know,

383
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,240
for bear gets a hold of a deer.

384
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:55,931
That deer.

385
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:56,031
Good,

386
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,910
good luck swatting at kicking and,

387
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,470
you know,

388
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,170
but uh,

389
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,880
a deer kicking can fuck up.

390
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,250
A mountain lion could
kick him in the face,

391
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,270
break his jaw,

392
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,560
and then was the mountain lion.

393
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:05,771
Dude,

394
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,371
he's fucked.

395
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:06,941
He can't eat.

396
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:07,960
He's going to starve to death.

397
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,160
So the mountain lion,

398
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,550
it's imperative for to take that deer
out as quickly and cleanly as possible.

399
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,810
They go white for the neck,

400
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:15,040
they roll onto the body.

401
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,461
I mean,

402
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,660
it's really like a Jujitsu move.

403
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,230
They choke the life out of you.

404
00:12:18,231 --> 00:12:19,300
They always go for the neck.

405
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,150
They don't try to take you out
like in the middle of your back,

406
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,421
you know,

407
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:22,551
they,

408
00:12:22,551 --> 00:12:24,760
they go right where it's
going to be the quickest,

409
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:25,594
most effective way.

410
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,100
Bears on do that.

411
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,330
They just started eating you.

412
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,130
They just hold you down and start eating.

413
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,940
Yeah.

414
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,240
Grizzly bears,

415
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,110
uh,

416
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:34,500
I mean,

417
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,710
I,

418
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,060
I was in Alaska two years.

419
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:38,910
I know a lot more than I
should about bears probably,

420
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:42,750
but I think that the reason a lot of
people survive grizzly bear attacks,

421
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:44,430
but not black bear attacks.

422
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,151
Two reasons.

423
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:45,391
One,

424
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,650
black bears climb trees.

425
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,903
Grizzlies don't.

426
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,140
So you can't climb a tree.

427
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,320
And the other thing is
grizzlies will often,

428
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,760
and this ties into what you're saying,

429
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,650
grizzlies will often think they killed
you and then they'll kick some dirt over

430
00:12:58,651 --> 00:13:01,260
you so you can play dead with a grizzly.

431
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,520
They'll kick some dirt over you.

432
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:07,521
And often they'll come back later because
they like the meat putrefying French

433
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:08,694
cheese.

434
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:09,630
They like,

435
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,050
it's stinky and gooey here.

436
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,120
They actually compost,

437
00:13:12,121 --> 00:13:12,954
you know,

438
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:13,850
it really.

439
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,410
Do they cover you with leaves and dirt?

440
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,790
It's sort of a must be Dha.

441
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,160
Is it to hide or to
accentuate the process?

442
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:19,491
I wonder.

443
00:13:19,491 --> 00:13:19,810
Yeah.

444
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,780
Good cooking.

445
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:21,620
You are cooking.

446
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,990
You with brought dirty containing animals.

447
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,900
We know everybody is like that.

448
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,480
People love bears and I,

449
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,010
I think they're majestic and I'm certainly
not saying we should eradicate them

450
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:31,880
for the face of the planet,

451
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:35,240
but the only reason why we love them is
because they're not in our lives on a

452
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,074
daily basis.

453
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,690
If we had grizzly bears in our streets,

454
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:41,060
you would have fucking wheel problems,

455
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:41,480
man.

456
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,830
Like monster movie problems where it's
going to eat your children right in front

457
00:13:45,831 --> 00:13:46,220
of.

458
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,370
Have you seen grizzly man?

459
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,440
Have I seen his filling?

460
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,310
Huh?

461
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,170
Recommended to everyone.

462
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:51,590
Yeah.

463
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,940
I guess we were in the
middle of a commercial.

464
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,750
Sorry.

465
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,021
No,

466
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:54,251
don't,

467
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,080
don't apologize.

468
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,210
That's how we like to do it.

469
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,330
I'm just a lot of good shit there folks.

470
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,430
If you go to a audit.com o n n I t,

471
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,600
there's all sorts of different supplements
as well as cool fitness equipment,

472
00:14:05,601 --> 00:14:09,170
but if you're looking for that kind
of strength and functional fitness

473
00:14:09,171 --> 00:14:09,501
equipment,

474
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,120
we have you covered battle ropes,

475
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:11,780
kettlebells,

476
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,411
club bells,

477
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:13,244
all that good shit.

478
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,440
Gummy bears,

479
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,540
but actually do have a company in Paris.

480
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,080
We have government.

481
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,280
We sell certain foods that we
find finding me really healthy,

482
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:23,600
like a hemp protein powder and coconut
oil and stuff along those lines.

483
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,710
But we also have these,

484
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:25,070
um,

485
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,480
Omega three gummy worms.

486
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:27,260
Wow.

487
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,471
Yeah.

488
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:27,951
My kids.

489
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:28,121
Well,

490
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:31,220
one of my kids likes it and the
other kid is not into it at all.

491
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,510
We have these fish oil,

492
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:33,800
their official jellies.

493
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,090
One of my kids loves him.

494
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:35,950
She asked for all the time.

495
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,160
He fucking hates it.

496
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,890
The other one thinks it tastes like shit.

497
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,260
This is terrible.

498
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,103
Look at her face,

499
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,940
but the little one just gobbles it up.

500
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,840
It's really good for him.

501
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,260
You know,

502
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,730
it's a way of getting kids,

503
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,510
uh,

504
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,161
essential.

505
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:48,440
Uh,

506
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,520
central fatty acids.

507
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,740
A killer honey as well.

508
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:55,610
We got done Himalayan salt
and all sorts of good shit.

509
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,720
O n n I t a,

510
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,020
the code named Rogan.

511
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,950
He will save 10 percent off
any and all supplements.

512
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,910
I like the overview.

513
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:04,030
Just shows a bunch of boats in the water.

514
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,581
The what?

515
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:04,960
Review.

516
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,380
This is the overview for the.

517
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,090
It's a bunch of boats.

518
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,330
You guys sell boats.

519
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:10,820
It's like,

520
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,031
Hey,

521
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,070
we can get it from the city water.

522
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,193
What does it say?

523
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:15,800
Oh,

524
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,120
fish oil distributors.

525
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:17,954
Is that what it says?

526
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,290
No oil jellies for kids overview.

527
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,220
Here's a boat.

528
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,670
Yeah.

529
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,301
It doesn't say anything,

530
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:26,030
but we got our fish from a boat.

531
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,730
See boats float in the water.

532
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,410
That is really stupid.

533
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,150
Why would they show boats?

534
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,620
Did you know that?

535
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,430
Fish live in water and
people don't live in water.

536
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,870
Look like shitty old birds.

537
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,950
Doesn't look like good water.

538
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,390
They come from like Norway.

539
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,170
They don't have.

540
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,810
They don't really need to
have any better boats in that.

541
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,280
Just Shazam blue water,

542
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:46,710
you know?

543
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,570
Nice beach.

544
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,810
Well those are the boats that go and
get our fish that we need to make our

545
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,890
essential jellies.

546
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:52,911
How dare you.

547
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:53,480
Brian,

548
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,880
do you ever watch that
fucking deadliest catch show?

549
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,170
They don't have like the coolest boats.

550
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,220
Those guys aren't yachts.

551
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,190
We snuck this girl and using these boats.

552
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:01,281
Yeah.

553
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,140
What's that girl doing?

554
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,280
Certified young fellow kids.

555
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:04,911
Full of Shit.

556
00:16:04,911 --> 00:16:06,440
They paid it all the hands like that.

557
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,753
She's like,

558
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,241
totally.

559
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:10,960
They give a real real chocolate
if she can just fuck it.

560
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,970
We have a hershey's bar
right behind the camera.

561
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:14,211
Honey,

562
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:16,280
I need to just make two
fists like a fighter.

563
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,740
Chuck Liddell make leg.

564
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,440
Chuck Liddell.

565
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,170
Yeah,

566
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,220
they photoshop the.

567
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:22,070
The handcuffs offer thumbs up.

568
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,080
You can see like right here,

569
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,040
there's like a handcuffed that
hasn't been photoshop off.

570
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,380
If you look at the left arm,

571
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:27,981
it looks clearly.

572
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:30,020
Duck taped doesn't look real at all.

573
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,400
What is the hair?

574
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,903
Okay.

575
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:34,740
Don't be a fucking doctor.

576
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,270
Laser.

577
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,841
Oh look,

578
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:39,870
she's got one strand of hair over white
shoulder and the rest of her hair's

579
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,221
behind.

580
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,240
It's not a mystery at all.

581
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,074
You fuck.

582
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,620
No.

583
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,610
You're a conspiracy.

584
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,450
Tinfoil hat.

585
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:45,284
Picture Guy.

586
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,520
You're looking for issues.

587
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,110
This ain't even a real kid.

588
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,010
That's a boy's head.

589
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:50,960
They gave him fucking ponytails.

590
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,213
I got news for you.

591
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,630
Boys and girls look pretty much the
same when therefore no one knows.

592
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,670
Really fucking branched out
and run away from the pack yet,

593
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,730
but I'm on a Dotcom O,

594
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:03,570
n n I t go name,

595
00:17:03,571 --> 00:17:03,960
Rogan.

596
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,191
Alright.

597
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,510
Dr Chris Ryan is here.

598
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,520
We're going to figure some shit out folks.

599
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:07,850
We're gonna.

600
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,170
Explore some ideas.

601
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:11,150
We're going to expose
some cultural problems.

602
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:13,040
We have hit the music.

603
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,900
No,

604
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,350
please.

605
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,183
Okay,

606
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,330
the Joe Rogan experience

607
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,480
Joe Rogan podcast all day,

608
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,270
international man of mystery World Travel,

609
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,613
man,

610
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,101
author,

611
00:17:34,101 --> 00:17:35,180
Xtrordinair.

612
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,411
You're a,

613
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:40,840
you have a broad range of experiences
that you can draw upon Mr Chris Ryan,

614
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,430
and to appreciate you very
much coming back here again.

615
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,040
Thanks man.

616
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,720
It's an honor.

617
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,321
Oh please.

618
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,260
It's an honor to have you
back to your book is amazing.

619
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:49,094
If you haven't read it.

620
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,290
I've been reading it
over the past few months.

621
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,040
Um,

622
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,500
along with the new Steve
Rinella book meat eater.

623
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,080
I can throw you back and
forth with this book.

624
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,611
It's a great book,

625
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,010
man.

626
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,590
There's so much interesting shit in it.

627
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,430
It's a,

628
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:07,430
it's such a fascinating sort of exposure
about sexuality and evolution and how

629
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,780
we sort of evolved and how we've,

630
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,530
you know,

631
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,530
got to this point where it's kind of
gotten away from us and there's all this.

632
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,610
I think Duncan trussell said it best.

633
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,670
He said that you exercise
shame from people.

634
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,010
You know what that term,

635
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,430
until I told you I'm working on
a new website using squarespace,

636
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,170
which is not bullshit.

637
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,004
I'm not saying that,

638
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,751
but my,

639
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:30,961
you know,

640
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,140
we've got Chris Ryan and
then under it says a author,

641
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,970
public speaker or something.

642
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,530
I love that phrase.

643
00:18:41,531 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah,

644
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,833
you're.

645
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,810
That book is.

646
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,230
Yeah.

647
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,030
For a lot of people it makes you go,

648
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,571
oh,

649
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:46,811
okay.

650
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:48,820
That's why these fucked
up thoughts or come,

651
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:49,631
I'm not fucked up.

652
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,150
Everybody's system's fucked up.

653
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,601
Oh,

654
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:56,050
we're living in this crazy time of shame,

655
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,470
chime of a

656
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,520
oddly defined identities and roles
that we're supposed to take on.

657
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:04,900
That seemed very unnatural.

658
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,640
You know,

659
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,473
and it's,

660
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,350
it's weird times.

661
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:09,760
We live in weird time sexually.

662
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,633
I think we do,

663
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,271
you know,

664
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:12,230
the Chinese thing,

665
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:12,411
you know,

666
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:13,910
may you live in interesting times,

667
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:14,870
which is a curse,

668
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,860
you know,

669
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,820
but I think we do.

670
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,500
We do live in very interesting times.

671
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,510
There's a quote we use in
the book from the playwright,

672
00:19:20,511 --> 00:19:21,231
Arthur Miller,

673
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:23,390
who was married to
Marilyn Monroe for awhile.

674
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,430
He said,

675
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,040
uh,

676
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,920
an era can be considered
over when it's basic.

677
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:29,600
Illusions have been exhausted.

678
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,070
I'd love that quote.

679
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,730
It's basic illusions who have been
experienced and I think we live in a time

680
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,660
where pretty much all our basic
illusions are exhausted politics.

681
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,860
Nobody thinks they're the shit that's
going on in Washington is anything other

682
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:43,281
than,

683
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:43,551
you know,

684
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:45,260
back the yield trading for whatever,

685
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,070
you know,

686
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,570
I'm banking,

687
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,990
nobody believes banking is for
the good of the country anymore.

688
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,500
It's like people have realized
that everyone's on the take.

689
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:59,770
The institutions are not respected and
that includes marriage to a large extent.

690
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,410
And so there's this struggle going on
over marriage and monogamy and gay rights,

691
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:05,741
you know,

692
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:07,940
in terms of a same sex marriage.

693
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,460
So I think we're in this war.

694
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:11,570
I mean there's so many things,

695
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:12,050
diet,

696
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,291
you know,

697
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:15,530
you're on the forefront of a lot
of this sort of recalibrating,

698
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,411
you know,

699
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,211
what works,

700
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:17,871
what's right,

701
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,330
what actually has benefits,

702
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:20,751
you know,

703
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:23,630
as opposed to the bullshit that
we're being fed all the time.

704
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,231
So.

705
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:27,020
And I think a lot of that's
due to the Internet probably,

706
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:27,750
that you can,

707
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,160
you know,

708
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,630
if your message is strong enough,

709
00:20:29,631 --> 00:20:30,790
it doesn't matter who you are,

710
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,700
who's backing you,

711
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,930
you can reach people.

712
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,921
So I think,

713
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:34,131
yeah,

714
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,990
I think we're in really interesting times.

715
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,900
It's an effect on our culture
of that the workforce,

716
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:42,700
the workplace brings and it's,

717
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,653
excuse me

718
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:46,803
everyday during the,

719
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,670
at the workplace,

720
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:48,850
you know,

721
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,541
some of my black,

722
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,111
but uh,

723
00:20:50,111 --> 00:20:50,291
no,

724
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:50,561
I'm good.

725
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:51,030
Thanks man.

726
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,691
That's a beard.

727
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:52,790
That's a beer at least 10 minutes.

728
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,663
Black Butte,

729
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,050
but tea butte.

730
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,480
It's a delicious Porter Ale.

731
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,850
I would like to have one
of those and get moved.

732
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:01,990
It's um,

733
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,270
yeah,

734
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:02,491
I,

735
00:21:02,491 --> 00:21:06,280
I drank some of that for the
first time when I was a man.

736
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:09,640
I want to say Chicago where
I think it was in Chicago.

737
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:10,150
Yeah.

738
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,820
It was like the greatest beer I've
ever had in my life from bend,

739
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:13,510
Oregon.

740
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,750
Yeah.

741
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,680
What's the name of the company?

742
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,160
Uh,

743
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,110
the shoots,

744
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,513
shoots brewery.

745
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,090
Hey,

746
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,923
how dare you.

747
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,460
They should be a sponsor.

748
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,910
How about we just pump them up for free?

749
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:25,481
For free.

750
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:25,840
All right,

751
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,400
well that's good.

752
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,100
It's good beer.

753
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,290
And that's from a guy who
doesn't like porter much.

754
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:29,951
I was saying earlier,

755
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:32,200
it's normally kind of
heavy and sweet for me,

756
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:32,980
but this is nice.

757
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,190
Yeah,

758
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,490
no,

759
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,061
that's delicious.

760
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,280
What are we talking about
before we got off workplace?

761
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,290
You're talking about workplace.

762
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,560
Thanks for the.

763
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,620
I really feel like because
of the fact that you have to,

764
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,000
when you're in an office all day,

765
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,670
especially,

766
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,503
um,

767
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,750
with men and women working together,

768
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,430
there's this sort of professionalism
that you have to project.

769
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:56,080
There's this sort of fake way
of communicating where you,

770
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,110
you've completely eradicated anything
sexual from the menu of conversation and

771
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,090
even discussing it in the periphery,

772
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,770
dancing around it with a joke can
easily get you fired or you know,

773
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:10,480
about this dongle gate thing.

774
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,910
Are you aware of this memo?

775
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,940
I've heard reference to it,

776
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,100
but I haven't looked into it.

777
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,470
It's a fascinating story that has taken
place over the last few days in the tech

778
00:22:20,711 --> 00:22:21,220
world.

779
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,053
There was a woman,

780
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,730
a self professed feminist blogger.

781
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,081
Woman's.

782
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:27,531
Sorry folks.

783
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:28,364
I've got a little phlegm,

784
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,350
Jimmy,

785
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,551
me,

786
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:29,830
um,

787
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,240
some tissues I gotta blow my nose.

788
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,350
I'm.

789
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,880
This woman was at a conference and
some men behind her made a joke about

790
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,780
dongles.

791
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,220
It was someone said Dongguan says this
essentially is that dongle part of

792
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,284
something.

793
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,150
But it was what they're essentially doing
was I'm doing like a high tech version

794
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:50,050
of Beavis and butthead.

795
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,070
He said,

796
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,830
dongle biggest dawn was,

797
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,530
you know,

798
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,361
so these guys,

799
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:56,920
I don't know what the joke was,

800
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,623
but.

801
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,950
So she takes a photo of these guys and
then puts that photo online and says,

802
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:05,831
Hey,

803
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:10,810
these guys are violating the code of
conduct for the seminar and these guys are

804
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,341
on a,

805
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:12,850
you know,

806
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,890
in your conference there,

807
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,200
they're making jokes about
dongles are not cool.

808
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:17,770
Okay.

809
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:21,070
So these guys get fired
and one guy gets fired.

810
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:25,000
He's got three kids and
this woman writes his blog,

811
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:28,720
sort of justifying like
the environment that,

812
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,291
you know,

813
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,120
that sort of makes cool.

814
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,510
And that's the reason why she decided to
come out was because there was a little

815
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,510
girl on stage or a little
girl in the room or whatever.

816
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:38,231
And she was thinking,

817
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,850
what was this little girl?

818
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,120
If I don't stand up and stop this,

819
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:44,620
what is she going to be exposed to it?

820
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,040
Which is of grandiose when you're talking

821
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,200
about Dongles,

822
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,250
Jesus fucking Christ.

823
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,340
But what's truly fascinating
about this whole thing is a,

824
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:53,990
first of all,

825
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,590
the response by the Internet
because the man was fired.

826
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,120
Um,

827
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,360
but don't put those guys online.

828
00:23:59,361 --> 00:23:59,930
Dude,

829
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,740
why are we doing that?

830
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,790
I mean there's no need to keep.

831
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,050
Yeah,

832
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,321
I know.

833
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:03,531
I mean,

834
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,500
I just don't think they,

835
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:06,890
they didn't ask to be online.

836
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,830
Those guys never asked to be on those.

837
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,770
Those photos were taken by this woman
and it turned into this big thing.

838
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,730
She has like an online media
thing that she does already.

839
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,620
So she is like a big presence,

840
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,120
a lot of twitter followers.

841
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,540
And she just took a photo of these guys
and just put them out in the world for

842
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:26,230
no reason.

843
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,340
I mean they didn't ask
for it and she says,

844
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,260
here's the guys that tell the Dongle joke.

845
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,150
So one guy gets fired.

846
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:37,000
She writes this crazy blog
and anonymous jumps in there,

847
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,500
like,

848
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,910
what?

849
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,930
Fuck you.

850
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,690
Oh really?

851
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,130
They were like,

852
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,870
this is absolutely fucking posture
is the way this woman's behaving is

853
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:45,681
repulsive.

854
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,840
And it just went off.

855
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:51,550
And so they threatened the company and
they said they were going to go after

856
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,960
their clients and they were gonna,

857
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:53,480
you know,

858
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,620
denial of service attacks and
whatever they were going to do.

859
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:56,330
Like,

860
00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,320
I don't know if you need even directly
threatened it or indirectly threaten it,

861
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,041
but they're like,

862
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,450
you,

863
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:01,880
you got to,

864
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,713
this is just the beginning.

865
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,770
You've got to get rid of this check.

866
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,090
And they fired her immediately.

867
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,320
Oh,

868
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,210
I thought you meant the
company that fired the guy.

869
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,140
Did they different kinds of.

870
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,820
I don't know if they brought the guy back,

871
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,481
but you really,

872
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,000
the guy should get a job at a company
that's not a bunch of fucking pussies

873
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,660
because that's the most
ridiculous shit ever.

874
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,090
And one man,

875
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,021
isn't it?

876
00:25:18,021 --> 00:25:20,060
Like it's nothing.

877
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,223
You know,

878
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:21,650
I,

879
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,220
I,

880
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,140
I haven't had a job since the eighties,

881
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:25,790
so I'm not the guy that really,

882
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,624
you know,

883
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,840
but I can't imagine pissing
into a cup to have a job.

884
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,180
I don't understand that drug test,

885
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,650
drug test for insanity
and complete insanity.

886
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,390
The fuck does it matter if I smoked a
joint two weeks ago and I come into work

887
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:38,721
today,

888
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:40,400
what the hell are we talking about?

889
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:41,270
It's insane.

890
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,840
Complete total insanity
and it's just this sort of

891
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:51,110
designed to get people moving in this
direction of blind obedience and that's

892
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,430
what your employer would like for you.

893
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,541
But by the way,

894
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:57,080
I think that's another one of these
basic illusions that's exhausted.

895
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,840
We got ran Paul coming
out for legalizing drugs.

896
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,650
Yes.

897
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,640
I just saw the headline.

898
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,661
You know,

899
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:03,110
so I,

900
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,510
I think maybe we've turned a corner.

901
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,270
It's gotten so crazy that,

902
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:08,571
you know,

903
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:09,800
anonymous is standing up.

904
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,370
That's great.

905
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,020
I think the Internet represents the real
mind of the people today and I think

906
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,740
when,

907
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,910
when a big movement like this
sweeps across the Internet,

908
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,230
and this is a very minor one,

909
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,550
let's go with a major one.

910
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:23,550
Let's go with wikileaks.

911
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,820
The overwhelming support of Wiki leaks
by people online as opposed to how it's

912
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:33,050
represented in the mainstream
media is a big difference,

913
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,090
isn't it?

914
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:34,760
People Online,

915
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,470
it's like people 35 and under.

916
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,220
Mostly.

917
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,360
I don't think so anymore.

918
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,751
No,

919
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:40,150
I don't think that's applicable anymore.

920
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,660
I think pretty much everybody's online.

921
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:44,820
I think there's been over the last decade
there's been this assimilation towards

922
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:48,450
older and older folks and then the people
who are 30 or now 40 and that's just,

923
00:26:48,451 --> 00:26:48,691
it's,

924
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,280
you know,

925
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,280
I think the ideas are too powerful
and the method of distribution is too

926
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:58,350
powerful and now we're dealing with
this ancient paradigm that doesn't,

927
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,620
it doesn't really work with the amount
of information that we have today.

928
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
It's like this old car that we're trying
to keep fixing and putting new tires on

929
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,040
your fucking model t it's
a piece of shit it worse.

930
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,860
Cuba as Cuba's got least cool cars,

931
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,110
they really take care of.

932
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:16,944
Well,

933
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:22,310
it's an amazing model of like recycling
and true recycling and the unnecessary

934
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,780
aspects of constantly getting
new and improved things.

935
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,870
A friend of mine wrote a book called the
Chase Chevrolet and Castro's oldsmobile

936
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:35,371
or something like that.

937
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:35,790
I mean,

938
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,930
his name is Richard Schweid.

939
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:37,081
It's,

940
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:38,520
he's written this guy so interesting.

941
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,440
He's published seven books,

942
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
one on Chili peppers,

943
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,860
one on cockroaches,

944
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,510
one on,

945
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:44,670
uh,

946
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,270
you know,

947
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,470
life after death.

948
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,390
One on Cuban cars,

949
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,100
he just like w eels,

950
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,993
he's got a book on,

951
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,230
he just like gets a hair up his ass and
decide something's interesting and he'll

952
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:58,920
just run it down and write a book about
it and then move onto something else.

953
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,780
That's amazing.

954
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,320
Uh,

955
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,620
what,

956
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,790
what I was saying earlier before I got,

957
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,850
before I got sidetracked about the
workplace is that the suppression of your

958
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:09,990
true humanity in the workplace,

959
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,280
your,

960
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,990
your ability to be free and
to be yourself and to be,

961
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,030
to joke around and have fun,

962
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,960
especially when there's
intersects politics when there's,

963
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:19,470
you know,

964
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,140
there's a cross of men and
women working together.

965
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,410
There's this sort of like fakeness that
goes on all day and then there's this

966
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:33,280
other level of fakeness that goes on
when you're out in the night lifetime

967
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,530
you're trying to get laid like,

968
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:36,510
so there's that fakeness as well.

969
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,720
And there's just such a small
percentage of time that humans,

970
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:45,660
men and women throughout the day interact
with each other on a truly honest

971
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,494
level,

972
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:46,681
you know?

973
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:51,180
So like it takes fucking decades
to understand each other.

974
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,340
It takes decades as a man under just
try to wrap your head around the idea of

975
00:28:56,341 --> 00:29:00,360
wanting babies growing inside of
you and wanting dicks and you know,

976
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:01,320
and being attracted to men.

977
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,610
Just wrapping your head around that.

978
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:07,611
It's a very strange concept because
we bullshit each other all day at work

979
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,740
before because we bullshit each
other when we'd go out on dates.

980
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,000
So social events,

981
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:13,490
we pretend to be someone you know,

982
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,740
more sophisticated or
interesting than we truly are.

983
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,490
Um,

984
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,760
I think that the amount,

985
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,030
the amount of time it takes before you
start understanding how people really are

986
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,240
as opposed to these bizarre
patterns that we keep following,

987
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,850
you know,

988
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,683
it seems,

989
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,160
and you didn't even mention media.

990
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:35,790
All the bullshit media pumps
into us about each other.

991
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,990
Men and women have a
unique relationship with,

992
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:40,560
uh,

993
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,470
with television.

994
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,040
And then had been

995
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,260
on a couple shows that
went on a long time.

996
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,020
I was on news radio for five years and
then it was on fear factor for six years

997
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,530
or so when people say,

998
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,981
oh,

999
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:54,250
there's a conspiracy and the government's
trying to dumb us down through

1000
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,084
television.

1001
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,920
That's not what's happening.

1002
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,080
What's happening is
that's what you're buying,

1003
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,170
that's what they're selling because that's
what you're buying and that's one of

1004
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:05,200
the reasons why it's gotten darker
and weirder over the past few years.

1005
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,680
Just because you're on the Internet
now and the walking dead could not have

1006
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,270
fucking existed a decade ago.

1007
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,220
No way you could have that on television.

1008
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:14,590
I saw a dude get his leg
hacked off with a hatchet,

1009
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,260
you know?

1010
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,551
I mean,

1011
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:17,950
you see shit.

1012
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,110
I couldn't believe what was the sheer
violence and insanity of the walking dead

1013
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,070
is impossible without the
internet and video games.

1014
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,541
Video Games,

1015
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,700
absolutely these uncensored environments,

1016
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,830
but that information's there now,

1017
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,350
so they have to adjust and change things,

1018
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:40,090
but the reason why fear factor
existed or or CSI exists,

1019
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,260
it's not that the government
is like trying to convince you.

1020
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,340
If you make a mistake,

1021
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,270
we'll catch you.

1022
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:48,520
We can take your
fingerprints from the air,

1023
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,031
you know,

1024
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:49,500
like,

1025
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:49,941
no,

1026
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:50,171
no,

1027
00:30:50,171 --> 00:30:50,351
no,

1028
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:50,531
no,

1029
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:50,800
no.

1030
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,200
It's just,

1031
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,060
that's what you want.

1032
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,140
You want crime shows.

1033
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,460
You're buying crime shows.

1034
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,240
If you buy crime shows because you're
scared because you look what's happening

1035
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,160
in the world will hold
what if the bad guy,

1036
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,220
so you're living your life in these weird
paranoid ideas through this artificial

1037
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,364
medium,

1038
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,290
but no one's trying to brainwash you.

1039
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,311
You think they are,

1040
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:13,420
but it's really more a matter of this
is what people actually bought and is it

1041
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,950
because that's what
they've been sold forever.

1042
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,281
Yeah,

1043
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:15,970
that too.

1044
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,860
Definitely that too,

1045
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,060
but there's a lot of dummies out there.

1046
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,550
There's a lot of domains that just want
to sit in front of the TV and watch

1047
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,460
someone get go to what's going
to happen on law and order.

1048
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,250
I'm going to guess the bad
guy's going to lose because I'm.

1049
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:29,600
No,

1050
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,960
I agree.

1051
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,793
I agree with you.

1052
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,890
Although I do think that there is.

1053
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,270
It's not brainwashing,

1054
00:31:35,271 --> 00:31:39,110
but I think who was at Marshall
Mcluhan said the medium is the message,

1055
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:39,321
right?

1056
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:39,590
Yeah.

1057
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,550
So there's certain things
that you sell that are,

1058
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,960
that are easier to sell through TV.

1059
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,490
So you sell those.

1060
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,330
Right,

1061
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,240
and they're the structure.

1062
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,291
I mean,

1063
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,190
I'm reading this book now,

1064
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,180
civilized to death.

1065
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:53,591
It's called him,

1066
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,100
so I'm really like deep into the shit,

1067
00:31:55,101 --> 00:32:00,101
but it's like there are
institutions are organic beings,

1068
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,480
companies are organic beings,

1069
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:03,830
so they,

1070
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:04,520
you're right,

1071
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,351
they sell the,

1072
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:07,360
they provide what sells because they're,

1073
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,180
they need to eat,

1074
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,230
they need to feed,

1075
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:09,920
you know,

1076
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,753
and grow.

1077
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,130
But I do think that there are structural,

1078
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:13,761
how can I say it,

1079
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:15,710
like structural biases that,

1080
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,010
that divert or,

1081
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:18,381
or,

1082
00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:18,830
uh,

1083
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,071
you know,

1084
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:23,930
sort of focus the media in different ways
and I think Internet is great because

1085
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:25,250
it's so dispersed.

1086
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,080
Whereas TV is very,

1087
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,030
I'm selling to you.

1088
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't hear a thing you say,

1089
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:33,200
except through Nielsen ratings
or some shit like that.

1090
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,150
It's like they're getting smoke signals.

1091
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:36,320
They're not getting a conversation.

1092
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,461
Whereas the Internet,

1093
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:37,791
it's like,

1094
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:38,091
wow,

1095
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:38,901
you've got clicks.

1096
00:32:38,901 --> 00:32:39,651
You eyes,

1097
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,040
you can

1098
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,060
measure everything.

1099
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,160
That's interesting.

1100
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:43,671
Yeah,

1101
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:43,941
yeah,

1102
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:44,540
absolutely.

1103
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,680
The idea of,

1104
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,040
you know,

1105
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,420
this is what we're going to offer you.

1106
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:52,250
It doesn't exist on the internet and
the choices are so vast that and the

1107
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,280
freedom that anybody
like you have a podcast,

1108
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:56,114
right?

1109
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,830
Generally speaking,

1110
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,401
as you can tell,

1111
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,330
it's my style.

1112
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,770
What's your preference for this podcast?

1113
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,810
Um,

1114
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,290
that,

1115
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:06,570
the,

1116
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:06,891
you know,

1117
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:07,191
any,

1118
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,220
anything along these lines that the
youtube videos that people have the young

1119
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,530
Turks or have these video.

1120
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,760
My last episode was with the Young
Turks that couldn't have existed.

1121
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,361
We talked about.

1122
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:17,760
Yeah,

1123
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,640
are they like you,

1124
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,320
it couldn't have existed without,

1125
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,640
without the Youtube possibility,

1126
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,430
the Internet possibility without,

1127
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:25,900
with,

1128
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,680
without that sort of a platform.

1129
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:32,990
And I think that sort of overwhelming
the old paradigm and it's slowly starting

1130
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:34,910
to a road.

1131
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,230
Um,

1132
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,721
but I,

1133
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:39,020
I also feel that the workplace,

1134
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:39,681
like people,

1135
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:43,430
people having to bullshit all
day is counterproductive to it.

1136
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,120
And it becomes a major part
of your awake time program.

1137
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:47,780
Yeah.

1138
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,090
It's so American.

1139
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,810
I have to say in Spain,

1140
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,153
you know,

1141
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,530
I can't speak for Spain in general,

1142
00:33:54,531 --> 00:33:55,550
but I've been there 20 years.

1143
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:55,940
So I,

1144
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,111
I,

1145
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:56,360
you know,

1146
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,840
I've,

1147
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,260
I'm pretty well familiar with the culture,

1148
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,710
but it's one of the things I love about
Spain is that politically correct sort

1149
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:06,910
of,

1150
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:07,160
you know,

1151
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,160
men are the enemies of women
and adolescent joking can
get you fired from your

1152
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:12,950
job.

1153
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,720
That isn't happening now.

1154
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,140
Women could have a
legitimate point by saying,

1155
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,680
yeah,

1156
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,850
because women's status in Spain isn't
as high as it is in there aren't legal

1157
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,280
protections and that,

1158
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:24,591
you know,

1159
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:26,990
women get harassed in
the street or whatever,

1160
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:27,830
and that's all true.

1161
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,950
So I don't mean to say Spain
is across the board better,

1162
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,910
but one thing I noticed in
Spain and I love about Spain,

1163
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,910
is that women,

1164
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,240
women don't assume you're a
rapist because you smile at them,

1165
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,291
you know,

1166
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:39,551
they,

1167
00:34:39,551 --> 00:34:41,540
they don't assume you've
got bad intentions.

1168
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,140
In fact,

1169
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,260
they assume you probably
have good intentions and you
just find them attractive

1170
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:47,840
and they smile back and everybody
keeps walking and there's no.

1171
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,370
It's like a win win.

1172
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:49,851
You know,

1173
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:53,000
there's no assumption of
victimization going on.

1174
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,210
I think in America
there's this assumption,

1175
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:56,991
you know,

1176
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:57,250
that,

1177
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,500
that you know why there's a little girl
on stage and these guys are making a

1178
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:04,100
dumb ass jokes somehow that's
connected and I got to expose this.

1179
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:04,401
I don't,

1180
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:07,550
I don't see that in Spain you
don't see that sort of shit.

1181
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,001
Well,

1182
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:08,261
the,

1183
00:35:08,261 --> 00:35:08,501
the,

1184
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:10,250
the fury that people had was this.

1185
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,540
They weren't joking with her.

1186
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,583
They weren't,

1187
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,580
they were joking amongst themselves and
literally the most innocent language

1188
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,670
possible for describing a dick or alluding
to a dick and that was enough for her

1189
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,640
to go.

1190
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,250
I've had enough like the.

1191
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,670
There's a craziness to that and someone
made a video called toxic women and

1192
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:31,030
stupid men and it's on youtube and deep,

1193
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,230
very in a very intelligent way.

1194
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:38,100
Details why people that think like
this or a real issue and men who allow

1195
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,680
them to get away with it without
saying this is preposterous.

1196
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,270
Their real issue too,

1197
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,400
because there's a lot of
white nights out there.

1198
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:49,230
There's a lot of really dumb weak dudes
that want to pretend that there with the

1199
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,040
girls,

1200
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,873
they think like,

1201
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,180
you know,

1202
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,661
you're right.

1203
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:55,380
These men are assholes and they'll make
videos about it and what they're looking

1204
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:57,060
for is like feminine Brownie points.

1205
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,310
They want feminist to
look at them and say,

1206
00:35:59,311 --> 00:35:59,521
yeah,

1207
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:00,354
you're one of us,

1208
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,600
and it's not necessarily that they
don't actually think that way.

1209
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:04,440
A lot of people are like,

1210
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,080
you're wrong,

1211
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,820
but I,

1212
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,860
I believe you do think like that,

1213
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:11,880
but I'm telling you that the motivation
for anybody thinking like that is false.

1214
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,960
You have a crazy,

1215
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,670
ridiculous way of looking at things.

1216
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:15,504
It's unbalanced.

1217
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,130
If you had no sex whatsoever,

1218
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:18,660
not male nor female,

1219
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,170
and you look at that as two human beings
and one human being was fired because

1220
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,350
another human being made a joke about
something that was being referenced

1221
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:27,090
onstage in a playful manner.

1222
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,010
Should that person be
taking sex out of it?

1223
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,060
Should that person be fired?

1224
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:30,510
Right?

1225
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,680
And if you say yes,

1226
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,514
you're a cunt,

1227
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:32,970
that's,

1228
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,410
that's the reality of the situation.

1229
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,210
You're a toxic person.

1230
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:37,650
That's a shitty way of looking at things.

1231
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,371
And by the way,

1232
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:41,910
I should stress that this woman did not
want these guys to be fired and she did

1233
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:42,930
not think that was her intent.

1234
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:43,770
She wanted them shut up.

1235
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,260
Whatever is maybe she's self righteous.

1236
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,090
Maybe she likes to go off on tangents.

1237
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,650
I don't think she should be fired.

1238
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:50,790
I don't think he should be fired.

1239
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,610
I think it has nothing to do with
whatever the fuck they do during the day,

1240
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,880
but I think it's fascinating when people
are forced to be behaving in a certain

1241
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:00,061
way.

1242
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:00,660
Like you're,

1243
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,020
you're,

1244
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,680
you're locked into this sort of nonsense
environment where you can't even talk

1245
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:05,514
about dongles.

1246
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:05,920
Yeah.

1247
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,310
You know,

1248
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,330
there's an article on salon.com,

1249
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,380
I think last week I linked to it and
it started this big firestorm on my

1250
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:17,120
facebook page where a woman wrote about
an experience she'd had the first time

1251
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:17,901
she'd had sex.

1252
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:21,500
I think she was 15 or something and she
was with a guy a couple of years older.

1253
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,401
And,

1254
00:37:22,401 --> 00:37:22,970
um,

1255
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,180
she just said she had a few drinks.

1256
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,660
You read it.

1257
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,410
Yeah.

1258
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,780
And so she was saying that wasn't rape.

1259
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,280
I made a bad decision.

1260
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,040
I had sex that I later
regretted it wasn't rape.

1261
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,240
And apparently like,

1262
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,690
oh,

1263
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,090
there's a huge firestorm around this.

1264
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:38,681
Yes,

1265
00:37:38,681 --> 00:37:39,011
there is.

1266
00:37:39,011 --> 00:37:41,260
Because there's the
feminist movement right now.

1267
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:45,880
Then one of the ideas that they're
pushing is the idea that is in place,

1268
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,260
I believe in Sweden.

1269
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:47,920
Whereas the,

1270
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,320
you know,

1271
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,153
where the,

1272
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,340
the idea being that regret,

1273
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:52,300
um,

1274
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,420
means that you can withdraw your consent,

1275
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,670
which is where a Julian Assan is
being accused of rape the woman he is

1276
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:01,300
supposedly rape,

1277
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:02,800
went out with them again the next night

1278
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,350
and had sex with them right before
what he was being accused of.

1279
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,970
I don't want to speak out of school,

1280
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:11,040
but I'm pretty sure it
was called surprise sex.

1281
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,390
It was the idea they were sleeping and
they had sex again without a condom.

1282
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,721
Yeah,

1283
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:16,351
exactly.

1284
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,660
And she didn't want this or she
was upset at this or whatever,

1285
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:18,930
you know,

1286
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,820
obviously they were looking to
get at him for something else,

1287
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,860
but that's about as obvious.

1288
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:23,730
You can get that one.

1289
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:25,210
I mean that is just fucking,

1290
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,310
it's just so happens that it's the same
guy that had no beef with them about

1291
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,840
leaking all the information.

1292
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,610
That's cool because there's
no law against that.

1293
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:32,791
Right?

1294
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,624
Is that what's going on?

1295
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,010
But the other shit you can,

1296
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,370
you can lock them up in a fucking.

1297
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,450
Didn't Brenda this morning?

1298
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:37,870
Yeah.

1299
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,411
Fuck man.

1300
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:42,970
They torture Bradley Manning truly
torchy's a hero that was in solitary

1301
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:47,590
confinement for some insane hundreds and
hundreds of days with no contact with

1302
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:48,424
another person,

1303
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,360
which they say literally
can make you crazy.

1304
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:50,710
Yeah,

1305
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,220
sure.

1306
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,270
And they wouldn't,

1307
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,280
they would take his clothes off because
they thought that he was a security

1308
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:54,581
risk.

1309
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:58,690
So he's cold and naked lights
all night lights constantly,

1310
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,830
and you know,

1311
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,460
for what,

1312
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,170
because he did what really his patriotic
duty led him to believe that he should

1313
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:05,860
do.

1314
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,860
You should release information that he
believes is contrary to the nature of the

1315
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:15,540
contrary to the idea of what most
people view of the military as,

1316
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,340
as only good guys over
there killing bad guys.

1317
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:20,170
And contrary to the law.

1318
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,830
Yes.

1319
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,101
You know,

1320
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:22,900
international and American law.

1321
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,770
Yeah.

1322
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,041
Yeah.

1323
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:24,400
He,

1324
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,880
what he did was what the New
York Times is supposed to do.

1325
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,590
You know what Daniel Ellsberg.

1326
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,270
Yeah.

1327
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:30,710
Yeah.

1328
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,270
There's a,

1329
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:31,900
you know,

1330
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,360
so I think the,

1331
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:33,590
I,

1332
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,540
the view of that,

1333
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,690
that's getting back to the
Internet thing on the Internet,

1334
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,410
that's pretty.

1335
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:38,910
I mean,

1336
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,340
most of the people that I communicate
with that's pretty much unanimous.

1337
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:42,851
I mean,

1338
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:44,050
pretty much everybody is like,

1339
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:44,380
well,

1340
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:44,651
you know,

1341
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:49,651
at the very least this exposes a real
issue that should be dealt with in the

1342
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,003
military,

1343
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,120
but you don't hear that from
mainstream media for mainstream media.

1344
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,610
They have eliminated that
guy from the discussion.

1345
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,830
You never hear him being talked about.

1346
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,041
See,

1347
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:01,180
that's what I was saying earlier,

1348
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:06,181
like the structure of the
of the institution dictates
what information can go

1349
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:07,061
through there.

1350
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:08,580
So because of the corporate interest,

1351
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:13,440
because Ge owns NBC or whatever their
and also makes the fucking missiles and

1352
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:14,770
the helicopters and the rest of it,

1353
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,220
they're not going to be able to take
that perspective because they're not

1354
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:18,900
independent.

1355
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,600
That's bullshit,

1356
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,320
right?

1357
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,560
Well,

1358
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,320
as some people like the
young Turks come along,

1359
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,060
they really become archaic.

1360
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,450
They don't make any sense anymore
because the young Turks will tell you,

1361
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:28,991
you know,

1362
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,000
they're going to tell
you what they believe.

1363
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,650
One hundred percent with
that guy believes what?

1364
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,551
They might not be.

1365
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:34,000
Right.

1366
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,571
They may be mean.

1367
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:35,950
He was off about Breitbart,

1368
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,930
about what the whole Andrew Wiener thing
he made fun of Breitbart for releasing

1369
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:41,660
that Jank.

1370
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,320
Yeah.

1371
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,560
Saying he's an idiot for doing
it and it turned out to be true,

1372
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,551
but you know that,

1373
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:45,940
that he,

1374
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,630
that's him.

1375
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,380
That's him.

1376
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:47,771
You know what I mean?

1377
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:49,150
He's talking straight to the camera,

1378
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:51,820
so maybe it doesn't have the
correct information at the time,

1379
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,920
but what he's telling you,

1380
00:40:53,921 --> 00:40:56,440
it's not being pushed by producers.

1381
00:40:56,441 --> 00:41:00,250
It's not being pushed by a network not
being pushed by a corporate entity behind

1382
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,010
the network.

1383
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,220
Right?

1384
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,440
You can't say that about the news that
we've come to accept as the mainstream

1385
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:05,711
news,

1386
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:07,060
whether it's CNN or Fox.

1387
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,560
There's no individual voice is no
individual point of view and you know,

1388
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,540
especially being.

1389
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:15,640
Occasionally you'll have
people give editorials,

1390
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,160
but those editorials or just Jesus Christ,

1391
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:18,330
Allah,

1392
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:18,980
cartoonish.

1393
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,470
They're cartoonish and nonsensical.

1394
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:24,700
Especially like Fox News is going to be
about the Democrats and Obama is fucking

1395
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:25,960
up and we turn to socialism.

1396
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:26,740
It's going to be so hot.

1397
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,580
It's so obvious.

1398
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,810
You don't even have to say it.

1399
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,150
Just show me what color
flag you hold them up.

1400
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:32,730
You've got a red flag or a blue flag.

1401
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,680
I your message.

1402
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,230
Just show me a red,

1403
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,560
a flash of red.

1404
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:40,550
And that idea is basically just as good
as whatever the fuck comes out of your

1405
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:40,910
mouth.

1406
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,743
Yeah.

1407
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,070
You're going to have to have me back a
third time because we're never going to.

1408
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,580
Oh,

1409
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,271
we will though,

1410
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:47,541
man.

1411
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:47,991
We will.

1412
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:48,800
We will.

1413
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,380
But I really wanted to
have you one after this.

1414
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,040
This thing,

1415
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,380
this dongle gate broke out because

1416
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,730
I think one of the things
that your book really,

1417
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,090
really highlights is the weirdness in
which women are not supposed to except

1418
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,520
their sexuality or accept the fact that
they get horny or broadcasted in any way

1419
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:12,240
or even you know,

1420
00:42:12,241 --> 00:42:17,241
it acknowledge it and that if there's
a sexual joke going on where a man,

1421
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,720
even if he doesn't even
involve that woman,

1422
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,310
make some sort of a sexual joke,

1423
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:25,430
that somehow that woman is
a victim because she doesn't
want to have anything to

1424
00:42:25,431 --> 00:42:26,121
do with sex.

1425
00:42:26,121 --> 00:42:26,750
Right?

1426
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,930
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with their,

1427
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,320
either their advances or jokes about it.

1428
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,270
Korean image.

1429
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:31,691
You know,

1430
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:32,860
the Victorian era.

1431
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,250
You only had sex with your
wife in order to have babies.

1432
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,890
You had sex to have sex with.

1433
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,780
Court assigns with prostitutes,

1434
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:41,110
with,

1435
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,501
you know,

1436
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:46,501
the housemaid with whatever you didn't
fuck your wife for fun or for pleasure.

1437
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,740
Was that across the board.

1438
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,933
Kevin agreed.

1439
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,530
Upperclass Victorian British
society across the board,

1440
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:53,750
you know,

1441
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:54,400
not on,

1442
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,500
in France and other European societies.

1443
00:42:56,501 --> 00:42:57,370
There is a different vibe,

1444
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,750
but that's the society Darwin came out.

1445
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,520
Right.

1446
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,500
And as we tried to explain in the book,

1447
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,680
that's the mentality that informs our
understanding and the scientific view of

1448
00:43:08,381 --> 00:43:11,830
human sexual revolution because
Darwin was an uptight guy.

1449
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,761
He was great.

1450
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:13,451
He was a genius.

1451
00:43:13,451 --> 00:43:14,284
He's a cool guy,

1452
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,140
but he was super repressed.

1453
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:16,670
Sexual.

1454
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,190
He never had sex ever.

1455
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:18,461
Right.

1456
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:19,950
Isn't the only with his wife whom,

1457
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,500
who was his first cousin
from the Wedgewood family,

1458
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,251
which are the Wedgewood,

1459
00:43:24,251 --> 00:43:24,930
China.

1460
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,200
Fortunately they still,

1461
00:43:26,201 --> 00:43:28,120
they're still making China and in England.

1462
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,080
Um,

1463
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,640
and she was 30,

1464
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,080
I think he was 29.

1465
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,320
And his brother married with Newton.

1466
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,620
Newton was a sexual right.

1467
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,523
Yeah.

1468
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,820
Didn't have during the.

1469
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:41,700
Excuse me.

1470
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,600
During the Victorian era,

1471
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:45,570
didn't they cover up like legs of pianos?

1472
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,110
Right.

1473
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,670
And tables and chairs.

1474
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,381
Oh yeah.

1475
00:43:49,381 --> 00:43:50,700
Because it would excite people.

1476
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,180
It's so amazing.

1477
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:53,400
It's like,

1478
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:53,550
it's like

1479
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,181
the Burka,

1480
00:43:54,181 --> 00:43:55,160
now you know why?

1481
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,321
Oh,

1482
00:43:55,321 --> 00:43:56,520
it's crazier than the Burka,

1483
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,031
but you know,

1484
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:00,150
what's cool about the
burqa and I'm doing this,

1485
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,320
I'm pitching this TV show,

1486
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:03,360
which seems like it's going
to get picked up by the way.

1487
00:44:03,361 --> 00:44:03,440
And,

1488
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,273
and the,

1489
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:04,590
um,

1490
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,350
one of the episodes is about,

1491
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,910
is based on the story I heard from a
woman who worked at Victoria's secret in

1492
00:44:11,911 --> 00:44:16,911
London and she told me that most of the
lingerie they sold was to very wealthy

1493
00:44:20,131 --> 00:44:25,131
Saudi and Kuwaiti women who came in and
we'd just buy out the store because they

1494
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,600
were sexy lingerie under their Berkus.

1495
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:28,591
Yeah.

1496
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:30,250
But it's under that stupid 10.

1497
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,813
They do.

1498
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,260
I mean,

1499
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,830
it's got to be compensating for the fact
that they're forced to wear that stupid

1500
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,490
outfit.

1501
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,140
I don't think there's anything
good about that outfit.

1502
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,070
I mean,

1503
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:43,470
the only thing good about it
is if you're the man like,

1504
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:43,861
man,

1505
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:47,850
nobody gives a look at this
says mine's going into the tent.

1506
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,190
It's just the what,

1507
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:49,710
you know,

1508
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,543
what's offensive.

1509
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,590
Not the religious connection to it,

1510
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,610
but the suppression,

1511
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,230
the idea that a woman has to wear that.

1512
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:55,620
Right.

1513
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:56,940
It's the most depressing thing ever.

1514
00:44:56,941 --> 00:44:58,890
You're covering everything
about your identity,

1515
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,370
right?

1516
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:03,780
Especially it fucks up a girl if she's
in a shit relationship and she's looking

1517
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:05,160
for another dude.

1518
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,660
She's looking for a little escape plan.

1519
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:07,760
You know that guy has no.

1520
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:11,790
What the fuck is getting into dress
getting abused and nobody can see her.

1521
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,530
Her bruise marks.

1522
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,431
That's another way that.

1523
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:14,770
Yeah.

1524
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:15,570
That's another point.

1525
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,020
Yeah.

1526
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,351
Anyway,

1527
00:45:16,351 --> 00:45:17,131
I jumped off.

1528
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:17,964
What were we talking about?

1529
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,953
That

1530
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,110
shit before.

1531
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:25,831
Oh Man,

1532
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:26,621
I'm not even stone.

1533
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:26,810
Yeah.

1534
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:26,991
Oh,

1535
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:31,700
we were just talking about the suppression
of sexuality that women don't feel

1536
00:45:31,701 --> 00:45:32,534
like a

1537
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,650
Koreans in Darwin and all that.

1538
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah,

1539
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,873
yeah,

1540
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,331
yeah.

1541
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:36,720
I mean,

1542
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,400
when we originally pitched this book,

1543
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:43,350
it was called what Darwin didn't know
about sex and the idea was to write a

1544
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:48,351
biography of Darwin sex life and then tie
that into our modern misconceptions of

1545
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:52,020
sexuality because he went and
he had lots of opportunity,

1546
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:52,321
right?

1547
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:54,840
He went on the Beagle all
down around South America,

1548
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:56,310
across the South Pacific.

1549
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,740
They stopped in Tahiti,

1550
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,310
which is sexual paradise,

1551
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:00,810
especially in the 19th century.

1552
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,260
It was,

1553
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,340
it was sexual paradise.

1554
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,310
That's why the mutiny on the
bounty happened because the,

1555
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,163
the bounty.

1556
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:07,921
You've seen the movie,

1557
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:08,161
right?

1558
00:46:08,161 --> 00:46:09,030
The Marlin Brando.

1559
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,290
I never saw that movie.

1560
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:10,660
Well,

1561
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,493
it's this,

1562
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,061
uh,

1563
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:12,461
so the,

1564
00:46:12,461 --> 00:46:12,930
the,

1565
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,600
the bounty I guess was captain,

1566
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,950
I don't remember what his name was,

1567
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,110
captain something flusher
or something like that.

1568
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:19,861
But anyway,

1569
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,700
it was a British,

1570
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,470
a whaling ship I think,

1571
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,180
or mapping ship maybe.

1572
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,841
But anyway,

1573
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:28,740
it stopped in Tahiti to spend about
a month or two months there to like,

1574
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:29,190
you know,

1575
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,950
get fresh water and fix the
ship and do all this stuff.

1576
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,400
Meanwhile the dudes went down and they
were on the island and there's a very

1577
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:40,401
relaxed sexual situation into hedy
and in many parts of the world.

1578
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:46,170
And so these repressed British sailors
who hadn't seen a woman and God knows how

1579
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:46,800
long.

1580
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,310
Suddenly there are all these beautiful
women around who were happy to have sex

1581
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:51,810
with them just for fun.

1582
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,213
And uh,

1583
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,440
so these guys are getting
laid left and right.

1584
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:56,101
And then the,

1585
00:46:56,101 --> 00:46:57,660
the bad ass captain says,

1586
00:46:57,661 --> 00:46:57,871
all right,

1587
00:46:57,871 --> 00:46:58,980
everybody back on the ship,

1588
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:00,060
we're going back to see.

1589
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,850
They get about four hours out to sea.

1590
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:05,790
And there's a mutiny
because the dudes are like,

1591
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,900
fuck this,

1592
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,640
we're going to go back to England.

1593
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:10,140
We're going back to the hedy men.

1594
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:11,370
So that's what they did.

1595
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:16,371
So this is this famous case because
there was like lots of Nice Pussy.

1596
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:21,670
You mean Nice women on your say pussy,

1597
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:21,891
you're,

1598
00:47:21,891 --> 00:47:22,150
you're,

1599
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:23,840
you're objectifying women.

1600
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,700
You're breaking them
down to one body part.

1601
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:27,530
I know what year,

1602
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:27,920
Hey,

1603
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,753
that's even worse.

1604
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,170
I,

1605
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:30,100
your intentions are pure.

1606
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,500
But for our women friends out there,

1607
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,230
that would be the white knight take on it.

1608
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,313
Well done.

1609
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,363
Calling them,

1610
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,620
calling them by their sexual organs.

1611
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:39,610
It's really not cool,

1612
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,444
man.

1613
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,680
Well last night I was at a party
and a woman said something,

1614
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,190
said some guy was a real dick.

1615
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,980
And I and everyone laughed.

1616
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:47,291
I said,

1617
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:47,780
that's funny.

1618
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,100
If someone was a country
I'd would be sort of nasty.

1619
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:51,934
Right?

1620
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:55,870
So we got into this whole conversation
about how come one body parts offensive

1621
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:59,850
and the other isn't well is
like if she called him a coc,

1622
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:01,650
that guy's a cock.

1623
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,020
That still,

1624
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,910
depending on how the
guy felt about the girl,

1625
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:07,601
you know,

1626
00:48:07,601 --> 00:48:09,880
if he thought she thought he was the shit,

1627
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:10,714
that would be a problem,

1628
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,733
that'd be devastating.

1629
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:15,910
I was a couple of weeks ago I gave a
Ted talk or talking about this corporate

1630
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,800
environment and um,

1631
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:18,460
you know,

1632
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,080
ted is Ted's wonderful.

1633
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,980
I think you had a guest.

1634
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,270
You're the guy who was there.

1635
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,810
Anyone.

1636
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,081
Yeah,

1637
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:23,621
exactly.

1638
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:24,070
Yeah.

1639
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:24,851
Graham Hancock,

1640
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:25,780
who also has had issues.

1641
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:29,460
Graham Hancock's had a very
interesting situation and shelter.

1642
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,680
Rupert sheldrake is good
friends with Stanley Kripner.

1643
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,330
You're going to be interviewing Saturday.

1644
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:34,780
Yeah.

1645
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,613
Yeah.

1646
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,060
He probably knows hancock as well,

1647
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:37,894
I don't know.

1648
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,760
But all those old hippie stick together.

1649
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:40,291
Yeah.

1650
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:40,540
Yeah.

1651
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,770
Intellectual,

1652
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,840
freaky guys.

1653
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:44,230
Um,

1654
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,951
but uh,

1655
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:45,341
anyway,

1656
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:48,490
so I've got this presentation
and when I did the rehearsal,

1657
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,710
one of the slides and the presentation
that I've used all over and know colleges

1658
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:54,544
all over and stuff,

1659
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:55,421
it's got.

1660
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:59,650
I'm talking about testicular ratio and
how that explained certain things about

1661
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:00,484
our ancestors.

1662
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,290
So I've got in one corner,

1663
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:05,920
there's a gorilla lying on his back
and the sun and there's like nothing.

1664
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,360
He's got no balls at all.

1665
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,160
They're like the size of kidney beans.

1666
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:10,210
They're inside his abdomen,

1667
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,110
so you don't see anything.

1668
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,640
On the other corner,

1669
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:15,910
there's a Banaba who's got
balls the size of chicken eggs,

1670
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,540
and in the middle there's a
picture of this buddy of mine in a,

1671
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,340
in a speedo sitting on a hammock and
he's got pretty big balls and so the law,

1672
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,660
it says like gorilla,

1673
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,510
but Nobo and over my
friend it says Italian.

1674
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,840
Right.

1675
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,760
That always gets a huge
laugh when I do that.

1676
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,150
I did this at Ted and they were like,

1677
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:34,481
okay,

1678
00:49:34,481 --> 00:49:34,811
you know,

1679
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:35,980
after the rehearsal they're like,

1680
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:36,161
oh,

1681
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:36,971
that was really good.

1682
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:37,391
That's great.

1683
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,590
Except that one.

1684
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:40,503
And they.

1685
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,730
They thought Italians would be offended.

1686
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:43,861
Oh my God.

1687
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:44,381
I'm always saying,

1688
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,310
you tell that Italian,

1689
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:46,210
he's got big balls.

1690
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:47,500
That's a compliment.

1691
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,320
Little do they know they have big
balls because the Italian women are so

1692
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,353
permissible.

1693
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,101
Read the book.

1694
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:54,934
Yes.

1695
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:55,803
Devastating.

1696
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,000
Devastating to the Italian mentality.

1697
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,060
I can't believe it.

1698
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,990
Maybe that's the part that's insulting.

1699
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,820
The size of your package is directly
proportionate to how slutty girls around

1700
00:50:06,821 --> 00:50:07,654
you are.

1701
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,910
I shouldn't say slutty and that was a
another fascinating aspect of your book

1702
00:50:12,911 --> 00:50:15,700
that I learned the origins
of the word promiscuous,

1703
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,640
that everybody was sort of
assumes that promiscuity,

1704
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,410
when United State Girls Promiscuous,

1705
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:23,950
that she just sleeps with
strangers and runs around.

1706
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:24,850
She's got loose morals.

1707
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,830
That's not the root of the word.

1708
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,130
The root of the word is mixed,

1709
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,650
meaning she has sex with
more than one person.

1710
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,820
She has relations with
more than one person.

1711
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:33,950
Generally speaking,

1712
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,840
probably knew those people her entire
life because the real origins of these

1713
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:41,000
sort of orgiastic tribal
societies of that,

1714
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:42,620
there's only 50 of them.

1715
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,860
They were living together in the woods
and they knew each other from the time

1716
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:48,800
they were born and they had sex
with each other and they had sexual

1717
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:50,720
relationships with more than one person.

1718
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,910
And our ideas of,

1719
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,390
you know,

1720
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,051
monogamy,

1721
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,830
monogamy,

1722
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,680
it's great if it works for you.

1723
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:02,770
If it works for you in 2013 and the
corporate world and the legal world is

1724
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:03,710
great,

1725
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,420
but if you look at 50 people
living alone in the woods,

1726
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,770
staying bonded together,

1727
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:13,010
the best way for everybody to truly
love each other as everybody fucks

1728
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,790
everybody.

1729
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,400
I mean you,

1730
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,550
you really are like monkey people.

1731
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,511
I mean your,

1732
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:21,950
your monkey people with more advanced
genetics and more advanced tools and shit,

1733
00:51:21,951 --> 00:51:26,060
but you're essentially living
not much different than you know,

1734
00:51:26,061 --> 00:51:27,800
than an animal with tools.

1735
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,620
You know,

1736
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,700
I mean,

1737
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,970
that's how people at
the dawn of time lived.

1738
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,680
Those people,

1739
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,660
it would benefit them
to be sexually engaged.

1740
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:36,950
Each.

1741
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,200
It would benefit them to be polyamorous.

1742
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:42,560
It would benefit them
to have love spread out,

1743
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:42,880
you know,

1744
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,191
deep,

1745
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,740
intense love with bunch of tribal members.

1746
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,440
Yeah,

1747
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,150
yeah.

1748
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:47,370
No,

1749
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:47,640
no,

1750
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,361
no question.

1751
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:49,194
In fact,

1752
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,220
when I was,

1753
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,130
you know,

1754
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:51,310
I,

1755
00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:55,650
I'd done all this research on tribal
people and they're really interesting

1756
00:51:55,950 --> 00:52:00,950
rituals that are seem designed to make
sure that people don't break down into

1757
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:04,740
nuclear families,

1758
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:05,071
right?

1759
00:52:05,071 --> 00:52:05,260
They,

1760
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,260
they're designed to make sure even though
you and this woman really like being

1761
00:52:10,801 --> 00:52:11,571
together and,

1762
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:14,880
and you know your hammocks are next to
each other and you spend most of your

1763
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,714
time together.

1764
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:16,981
That's great.

1765
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:20,400
And we're not saying that there was
no pair bonding right in prehistory,

1766
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:25,320
but all these cultures seem to have these
rituals to make sure that you and your

1767
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:27,180
woman both have sex with other people,

1768
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,561
right?

1769
00:52:28,561 --> 00:52:33,390
So like they're tattooing ceremonies where
everybody has sex and it's prohibited

1770
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,040
to have sex with your normal partner.

1771
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:36,020
Whoa.

1772
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,270
Or there what Wacky fucking cultures.

1773
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,480
If it's in the Amazon,

1774
00:52:39,481 --> 00:52:41,160
there are lots of the
men in the South Pacific.

1775
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:42,420
That's what happens when
you don't have the Internet.

1776
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,400
Start getting crazy

1777
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,120
sets one assholes idea email.

1778
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,861
It's one guy,

1779
00:52:49,861 --> 00:52:50,670
Richard,

1780
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:51,720
I'm going to fuck your wife.

1781
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:52,860
You're going to fuck my wife.

1782
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:54,000
I want to fuck your wife.

1783
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:54,834
Dude,

1784
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,990
let me make it a law.

1785
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,000
A law firm.

1786
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:01,320
You have to make it a law
that's fucking silly that,

1787
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,900
I mean they're social engineering
is no better than ours or theirs.

1788
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:05,910
They'll do what you want to do.

1789
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,840
This other societies,

1790
00:53:06,841 --> 00:53:07,620
the

1791
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,453
Kulina,

1792
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,433
uh,

1793
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,770
Paula Don pollock was the anthropologist
who lived with them for 20 years.

1794
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:16,380
He talks about this ritual,

1795
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,940
I don't know how to pronounce it,

1796
00:53:17,941 --> 00:53:18,501
but uh,

1797
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:18,800
the,

1798
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,800
the translates to the order to get meat
and the women will wake up in the and

1799
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:25,671
they,

1800
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:26,250
they,

1801
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,240
they get together and they say,

1802
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:27,451
okay,

1803
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,440
let's do this thing today.

1804
00:53:28,441 --> 00:53:32,670
So they all start singing and they'll
go around the village singing the song

1805
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:35,520
that translates to you guys are lazy.

1806
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,930
We don't get enough meat,

1807
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,400
when are you going to give us some meat?

1808
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:38,941
We want me,

1809
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:39,121
right?

1810
00:53:39,121 --> 00:53:40,290
So they're singing this and it's.

1811
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,430
And I asked him,

1812
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,610
does meet to have a double meaning it?

1813
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:44,041
And he said,

1814
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:44,370
yeah,

1815
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:44,911
definitely.

1816
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:48,450
It's like same as go hunting
but also give us some Dick,

1817
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:48,960
right?

1818
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,730
So while they're singing the song,

1819
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:55,080
they go around and the women will beat
on the post that's holding the guys

1820
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:55,914
hammock.

1821
00:53:56,490 --> 00:54:00,000
And that means if you go hunting
today and you bring back some meat,

1822
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,020
I'll sleep with you tonight.

1823
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,370
So it's like a motivation to get
out of your hammock and go hunting,

1824
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:08,640
but you can't hit the post
of your normal partner.

1825
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:09,870
It has to be someone else.

1826
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,093
Right?

1827
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,070
So then the men can,

1828
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:14,731
if they don't,

1829
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:14,941
like,

1830
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:17,700
if you don't want to have sex
with a woman who hit your post,

1831
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:18,481
you can say,

1832
00:54:18,481 --> 00:54:20,370
oh my stomach today,

1833
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:20,731
you know,

1834
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:22,770
whenever I'm not feeling
well you don't have to do it.

1835
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,371
But.

1836
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:24,480
So the guys who get up,

1837
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:25,860
they'll like get up and be all,

1838
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:26,550
oh,

1839
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,120
you know,

1840
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,840
grumbly and pissed off and then
they'll go leave the village together.

1841
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:32,850
But this area they hunt mostly monkeys.

1842
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:34,350
And so they hunt independently,

1843
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:34,741
right?

1844
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:36,180
Because the monkeys are spread out.

1845
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:36,781
So.

1846
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:38,970
But before they split up to go hunting,

1847
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:42,750
they'll agree to meet at this certain
point before they go into the village.

1848
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,250
So the uh,

1849
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:45,310
or the camp or whatever.

1850
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,380
So they'll go out,

1851
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:47,520
some of them will get a monkey,

1852
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:51,300
someone they meet back at this place
and they cut up the monkey so that

1853
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:53,940
everybody has a piece of meat
going back into the village.

1854
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,380
So everybody gets laid,

1855
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:56,214
right?

1856
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,410
So it's like pretty clearly,

1857
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:02,610
this is all about mixing it up and it's
not just for fun because there's nothing

1858
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:03,444
else to do.

1859
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,220
It's also to,

1860
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:05,880
to,

1861
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,713
um,

1862
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,300
to mitigate the risk of conflict,

1863
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,350
right?

1864
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,710
Because if you get possessive about
other people and their sexuality,

1865
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:17,640
you're going to have lots of conflicts
and conflict among this small shows.

1866
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:18,271
Social Group,

1867
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,691
as you say,

1868
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:21,030
it's 50 to 150 maximum,

1869
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:21,840
right?

1870
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,910
Because of Dunbar's number,

1871
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,620
which we can get into if you want.

1872
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:30,030
But we can be pretty sure that the groups
were never more than 150 individuals.

1873
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,470
So the worst thing that can happen is
you get schisms within that group because

1874
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,060
you're all depending on each other.

1875
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:36,511
You know,

1876
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:38,340
some people are better
hunters than others.

1877
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:41,300
Some people are better at cooking
or making bows and arrows,

1878
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,480
sheds and all this kind of stuff.

1879
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,670
Is that the origin of Dunbar's number?

1880
00:55:44,671 --> 00:55:48,990
Is that why we only have room in
our head for supposedly 150 close

1881
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,824
relationships?

1882
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:50,190
Yeah.

1883
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,240
Dunbar's is a biologist that
either Cambridge or Oxford,

1884
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,080
I don't remember which,

1885
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:56,430
but he was looking at um,

1886
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,870
uh,

1887
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,180
the,

1888
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:03,180
the brain size of different primates
and he found that he could predict the

1889
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:04,201
social,

1890
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:05,370
the group of the social,

1891
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:05,670
uh,

1892
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:09,450
size of the social group of any
primate by looking at its neocortex.

1893
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,230
And so when he looked at humans
and made that calculation,

1894
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:13,501
he said,

1895
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:13,741
okay,

1896
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:15,360
it should be about 150.

1897
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,030
And then they looked at the
anthropological record and they found,

1898
00:56:18,031 --> 00:56:18,211
yeah,

1899
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:18,691
interesting.

1900
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:21,330
When these social groups
grew to more than 150,

1901
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:21,930
they split.

1902
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,830
They tend to split into other groups,

1903
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,130
not

1904
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,000
acrimoniously just because

1905
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:26,780
this.

1906
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,590
So we've sort of developed a,

1907
00:56:28,591 --> 00:56:31,220
a need for a certain amount of space.

1908
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:31,790
It's,

1909
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,121
yeah,

1910
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:34,850
it's like that's as many
people as we can keep track of.

1911
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,650
And because we didn't encounter large
groups that was adequate for the time and

1912
00:56:39,651 --> 00:56:44,651
it takes a long fucking time for the
human genetics to adjust to their new

1913
00:56:44,721 --> 00:56:45,554
environment,

1914
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:46,730
which is very odd.

1915
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,970
But it made sense for a million years,

1916
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:50,691
for a million years.

1917
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:53,750
It totally made sense until the last
few hundred and then things just have

1918
00:56:53,751 --> 00:56:58,751
gotten so strange that the human genetics
are essentially the same as those

1919
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:00,560
people that are living in the Amazon.

1920
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,581
Yeah,

1921
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:01,821
I mean,

1922
00:57:01,821 --> 00:57:03,380
there have been some changes.

1923
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,350
There's a great book called the 10,000
year explosion that talks about the,

1924
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,310
the genetic changes that have
happened since agriculture.

1925
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,870
What are they like the
most significant ones?

1926
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,150
Well,

1927
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,890
eye color,

1928
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:13,730
skin color,

1929
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:14,564
hair color,

1930
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,811
you know,

1931
00:57:14,811 --> 00:57:15,140
there,

1932
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,020
there were no blue eyed
people 10,000 years ago.

1933
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:20,180
They know that DNA.

1934
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,590
Wow.

1935
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:21,861
Wow.

1936
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,420
They've got like 10,000 year old people.

1937
00:57:23,421 --> 00:57:23,901
DNA.

1938
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:25,360
Like that old dude that fell on the,

1939
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:25,550
uh,

1940
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,560
the ice man selling the a glacier.

1941
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,200
That's,

1942
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
if you haven't heard of that story,

1943
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,390
believably amazing story
because it's such a rare fine.

1944
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,600
This guy died and he fell in a crevasse
and the glacier went over him and didn't

1945
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:41,504
wipe them out.

1946
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,070
And that's really rare.

1947
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,090
Most things,

1948
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,720
glaciers were like a
mile high plus sometimes.

1949
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,050
And as they moved across Europe
and across North America,

1950
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,610
across everywhere on the world.

1951
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:53,900
And at one point in time there's glaciers,

1952
00:57:53,901 --> 00:57:54,734
right?

1953
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:55,603
Well,

1954
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:56,930
equatorial region,

1955
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:57,711
70 equator,

1956
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:58,160
right.

1957
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,511
The,

1958
00:57:58,511 --> 00:57:58,790
the,

1959
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:03,790
what they would do is just completely
erase everything that's in front of them.

1960
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:04,320
Yeah.

1961
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,270
Because houses,

1962
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:09,000
trees just crush everything rivers

1963
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,390
at all.

1964
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:16,280
So anything that died back then that
got crushed by this slow moving glacier.

1965
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,360
We have nothing.

1966
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,890
We have no evidence of it.

1967
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,440
That's,

1968
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:20,070
you know,

1969
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,140
I've got a book idea that relates to this.

1970
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,850
That's a really good point.

1971
00:58:24,851 --> 00:58:26,830
I hadn't thought about
the glaciers are racing,

1972
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:27,664
stuff like that.

1973
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,740
What I thought the book idea is,

1974
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:33,910
you don't remember how Rumsfeld going
into a rack said they're the known knowns

1975
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,610
and the known unknowns and the unknown.

1976
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,130
Uh,

1977
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:36,941
remember that whole thing.

1978
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:41,140
He's don't remember that he gave his
press conference and somebody was talking

1979
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:45,310
about predicting what was gonna happen
and he said they're the known knowns,

1980
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:50,350
the known unknowns and
the unknown unknowns.

1981
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:51,460
So the things you know,

1982
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:52,120
you know,

1983
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,691
things you know,

1984
00:58:52,691 --> 00:58:56,440
you don't know and the things you
don't know that you don't know what.

1985
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,920
It's kind of an interesting of
shitty idea to go to war with that.

1986
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,143
Exactly.

1987
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,710
So what I was thinking is write
a book about the known unknowns,

1988
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,560
the things we know we don't know,

1989
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,540
but that we ignore.

1990
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,010
Like for example,

1991
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:13,270
in anther anthropology,

1992
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,290
archeology,

1993
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:18,040
you're talking about the glaciers
wiping out whatever it was there,

1994
00:59:18,041 --> 00:59:19,740
which is absolutely the teenagers.

1995
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:20,501
Why about houses?

1996
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:21,860
They would wipe the valley,

1997
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,090
you

1998
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:22,740
know,

1999
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:23,250
gone.

2000
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,083
Yeah.

2001
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:24,720
So,

2002
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,160
um,

2003
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,300
it's pretty complete,

2004
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:27,020
you know,

2005
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:28,040
but the other was like,

2006
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:28,950
one,

2007
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:29,340
you know,

2008
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:31,160
people left Africa.

2009
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:32,211
Uh,

2010
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:36,670
the current understanding is about 70,000
years ago and spread out around our

2011
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,910
40,000 years ago.

2012
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,130
Seventy thousand years
ago is the Toba eruption,

2013
00:59:40,131 --> 00:59:42,080
which almost wiped out our species.

2014
00:59:42,081 --> 00:59:47,081
There were genetic tests show that
there were about 3000 couples,

2015
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:51,050
a reproducing couples that have
the genetic line has continued.

2016
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:56,051
So there was this huge bottleneck
because the lake Toba is now Lake Toba in

2017
00:59:56,691 --> 01:00:01,691
Sumatra was this eruption that triggered
an immediate ice age and like the feet

2018
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:07,240
of ash all over Asia and just killed
everything and triggered winter it was

2019
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:08,144
really nasty.

2020
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:08,931
But anyway,

2021
01:00:08,931 --> 01:00:09,380
the,

2022
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,940
about 40,000 years ago,

2023
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,860
our ancestors left Africa,

2024
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,120
the out of Africa,

2025
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,073
you know,

2026
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:18,080
event and they spread
out around the world,

2027
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,790
but they mostly follow the coastline,

2028
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:20,211
right?

2029
01:00:20,211 --> 01:00:20,931
Which you would,

2030
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:21,111
right,

2031
01:00:21,111 --> 01:00:25,070
because that's where like foods washing
up and there's shellfish in there and

2032
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:26,330
you've got good sight lines.

2033
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,130
So those bears and leopards and shit,

2034
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:28,970
you'll see them come in,

2035
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:29,160
right?

2036
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,250
You can run into the water
to get away from him.

2037
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:32,090
And you know,

2038
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:32,271
the,

2039
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:32,931
the sort of,

2040
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:33,710
um,

2041
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,030
the water that's not too deep,

2042
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:35,900
you don't have sharks,

2043
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:38,270
but it's deep enough to
keep the leopards away.

2044
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:38,570
Right,

2045
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:39,160
right.

2046
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:39,500
Um,

2047
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:39,981
so that's,

2048
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:41,960
and it's easier to walk on the beach,

2049
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:42,410
right?

2050
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,070
So that's,

2051
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:46,670
that was the root of the huge
exodus that went around the world,

2052
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:50,180
but sea levels were about
300 feet lower than.

2053
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:51,080
Whoa.

2054
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,970
So the stuff they're finding,

2055
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:53,511
you know,

2056
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:56,990
the whatever the stone tools
or the remains that there,

2057
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:59,230
they're finding from a 30,

2058
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,380
40,000 years ago,

2059
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,720
those weren't typical at all.

2060
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:04,550
The typical people were down on the beach.

2061
01:01:04,551 --> 01:01:09,551
So those must have been hunting parties
or people who were exiled or whatever.

2062
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,300
But they weren't at all typical.

2063
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:12,111
That's interesting.

2064
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:17,111
So I bet we're missing a lot of the
fossils and the little bits of evidence of

2065
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:18,770
those people that lived on the beach,

2066
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,000
which was the majority of the people.

2067
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,430
And that's the stuff
that's a representative.

2068
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,820
So it's pretty weird to build your image
of a society based on evidence that you

2069
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:29,630
know,

2070
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,190
is extraordinary,

2071
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,910
you know,

2072
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,530
but that's what we do
because that's all we got.

2073
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,440
I can remember really
clearly being in college,

2074
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:36,740
uh,

2075
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,180
thinking about human history,

2076
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:38,700
um,

2077
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,160
I,

2078
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,330
I don't remember what the
subject of the class was,

2079
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,520
but then I remember being in class and
just getting an idea just for the first

2080
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:46,761
time,

2081
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:46,990
but in,

2082
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:51,990
in very roughly of how little we know
about just what the fuck actually happened

2083
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,250
when you really start reading
books about events and,

2084
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:58,820
you know,

2085
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,540
I'm reading about like I was reading
about custer's last stand and um,

2086
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:03,380
you know,

2087
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:03,800
the,

2088
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,580
the,

2089
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:08,340
the account of the Indians account
and the survivors account and know,

2090
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,950
trying to piece it all together.

2091
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:10,180
I'm like,

2092
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,290
well,

2093
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:10,971
how crazy is it?

2094
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:14,750
Is really difficult to piece
this together in my head.

2095
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,823
You know,

2096
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,130
but today I can watch September happened
or I can watch a plane hit the tower.

2097
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:27,171
I can look the way we have recorded
things today is so vastly more intricate

2098
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,950
that when I look at what I know of,

2099
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,220
you know,

2100
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,360
jfk getting shot,

2101
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:35,880
what I know of seeing troops in Vietnam,

2102
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,570
like this history that is,

2103
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:38,370
you know,

2104
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:43,370
that I think of when you look at how
little we know about 10,000 years ago,

2105
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,210
30,000 years ago,

2106
01:02:45,211 --> 01:02:46,290
40,000 years ago,

2107
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,880
and then the idea that the only way you
find things as if people died in like a

2108
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:55,881
volcano or a mud slide because you got
to get a fossil or fell into a peat bog.

2109
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,010
It's like how many people
fall into peat bogs?

2110
01:02:59,370 --> 01:02:59,880
How much,

2111
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,570
you know,

2112
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:02,250
not enough fucking crazy.

2113
01:03:02,251 --> 01:03:06,020
What if all the smart people just rotted
in the ground and then go into this

2114
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,940
fucking bug?

2115
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:11,550
It was a whole race of super intelligent
people that never went into peat bogs

2116
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:12,030
ever.

2117
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:12,690
You know,

2118
01:03:12,690 --> 01:03:13,170
the earth.

2119
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:16,080
The first neanderthal
remains that were found,

2120
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,313
um,

2121
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:20,820
were like hunched over
and sort of deformed.

2122
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:22,320
And so for a long time,

2123
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:25,740
the image of a neanderthal
was this deformed crazy.

2124
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:29,730
Turns out that was like a
really diseased individual,

2125
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,121
right?

2126
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:31,430
It wasn't a typical neanderthal.

2127
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:31,771
Listen,

2128
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:34,770
it isn't a typical data
finding them very damaged,

2129
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,080
especially their spines.

2130
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,480
And like there's a lot of
times they're really fun.

2131
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,483
A lot of.

2132
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:40,750
Yeah,

2133
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:45,660
a lot of hunting accidents and also
apparently a lot of wear and tear on the

2134
01:03:45,661 --> 01:03:46,680
teeth and stuff.

2135
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:47,280
Yeah,

2136
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:47,671
yeah.

2137
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:48,504
I would imagine.

2138
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:49,180
Yeah.

2139
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:49,460
And,

2140
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,293
or tunnels.

2141
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:52,163
Yeah.

2142
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,430
Anyway.

2143
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:53,881
Yeah.

2144
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:54,420
It's um,

2145
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,030
it's just,

2146
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,460
it's really strange.

2147
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:56,631
I,

2148
01:03:56,631 --> 01:03:59,250
I've often said that human beings today,

2149
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,810
it's almost like waking up in the
middle of history as a person,

2150
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,280
as an individual.

2151
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,970
I've felt that way sometimes watching
a documentary or reading a book about

2152
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:12,570
something or trying to imagine what it's
been like several hundred years ago.

2153
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,530
It's like,

2154
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,250
all this has happened already
and it's all real clear.

2155
01:04:17,251 --> 01:04:18,930
You can sort of piece it together and go.

2156
01:04:18,931 --> 01:04:21,630
And then we got here and
it's like we woke up,

2157
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,621
we woke up and go,

2158
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:22,831
we're,

2159
01:04:22,831 --> 01:04:23,490
where are we?

2160
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,060
Where are we?

2161
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,930
Where on earth.

2162
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:25,550
Okay.

2163
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,383
How do we get to earth?

2164
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:26,581
Well,

2165
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:29,070
this is what we've calculated and
they lay out a piece of paper,

2166
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:29,340
okay,

2167
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,520
earth is near the sun and the sun
is surrounded by this other planets.

2168
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,380
Does another earth Muslim maybe?

2169
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:35,370
Probably most likely.

2170
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,900
Actually it's infinite.

2171
01:04:36,901 --> 01:04:38,580
So every possibility will exist.

2172
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:39,720
Infinite numbers of times.

2173
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,800
That's the real infinite.

2174
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:41,131
So we're like,

2175
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:41,401
okay,

2176
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:43,610
what the fuck are you talking about?

2177
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,100
And then someone goes,

2178
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,401
hey man,

2179
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:45,330
I figured some shit out.

2180
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,530
It's called quantum
theory and you're like,

2181
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,670
what the fuck are you saying?

2182
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,590
And then dude,

2183
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,710
there's gorillas.

2184
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:50,760
You'd go to the jungle,

2185
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,260
they found fucking gorilla.

2186
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:52,771
They're big,

2187
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:53,604
they're black,

2188
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,970
they're sorta human.

2189
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,640
Like get the fuck Outta here.

2190
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:57,301
I'm telling you,

2191
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:58,490
there's monsters out there.

2192
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,300
Like all that was,

2193
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,540
that's the 18 hundreds.

2194
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,590
I mean they didn't,

2195
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:01,950
they didn't.

2196
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,080
The Western world didn't know
the existence of gorillas
until the 18 hundreds.

2197
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:10,640
So it's kind of fascinating
when you really think of
like where we are right now

2198
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,703
and how,

2199
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,780
how much we know about how we got here

2200
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:19,390
and you and you didn't know
Bonobos till the 19 seventies,

2201
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:20,171
you know,

2202
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:21,310
are really start studying.

2203
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:21,521
I mean,

2204
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:23,680
they thought they were just
a sub species of chimp.

2205
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,541
They called them pigmeat.

2206
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:25,280
Chimps.

2207
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,540
Turns out they're so completely
different from chimps that they.

2208
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:33,430
They've forced us to completely reevaluate
the primate origins of human beings.

2209
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:34,081
Yeah.

2210
01:05:34,081 --> 01:05:38,700
It really threw a monkey wrench in the
whole explanation of why we're so warring

2211
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,250
and horrible violent.

2212
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,030
Want to do that?

2213
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:42,600
I swear to God,

2214
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,433
no pun intended,

2215
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:47,040
but the functional note
Banabos are like Super Sexual.

2216
01:05:47,041 --> 01:05:47,251
They,

2217
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:50,700
they solve everything
with sex and the sex.

2218
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,860
They don't have as the mother
doesn't have sex with a son.

2219
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:53,461
Man.

2220
01:05:53,461 --> 01:05:54,570
You did your homework.

2221
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:56,790
Now I've just been fascinated by monkeys.

2222
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,440
My whole life's apes.

2223
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,070
Champs.

2224
01:05:59,070 --> 01:05:59,730
Sorry.

2225
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:00,361
Mostly Champs.

2226
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:01,410
But other apes as well.

2227
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,750
Uh,

2228
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:02,071
but yeah,

2229
01:06:02,071 --> 01:06:02,530
apes.

2230
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:03,760
I know monkey sounds cooler though,

2231
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,810
among gender.

2232
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,440
Transgender monkeys have tails.

2233
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:08,970
That's your right.

2234
01:06:08,971 --> 01:06:12,060
Monkey balls is such a good phrase,

2235
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:12,980
you know.

2236
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:13,290
I mean,

2237
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:16,110
I use it all the time even though
I'm always talking about eight balls,

2238
01:06:16,111 --> 01:06:17,820
but the eight ball just doesn't ring.

2239
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:18,960
Yeah.

2240
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:19,421
That's why I.

2241
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:23,070
my one of my comedy specialist was talking
monkeys in space because talking apes

2242
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:24,120
in space just didn't.

2243
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:25,000
Yeah.

2244
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,370
It's missing something in Spanish.

2245
01:06:26,371 --> 01:06:27,580
There's no word for Ayp,

2246
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:28,650
actually real,

2247
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,600
which makes things complicated in
translating our book to Spanish.

2248
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,750
So is it just primates?

2249
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,390
Various premium names.

2250
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:35,971
Simeon.

2251
01:06:35,971 --> 01:06:36,590
Simeon.

2252
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:36,950
That's it.

2253
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:37,740
That's another good one.

2254
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:38,240
Yeah.

2255
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:38,610
Yeah.

2256
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,241
The monkey,

2257
01:06:39,241 --> 01:06:39,871
the monkey wrench.

2258
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:41,880
That was thrown in though
to get back to the bonobos.

2259
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:43,410
Bonobos are not violent.

2260
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:43,950
They don't.

2261
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:46,980
They don't kill other Benobos
then they just fuck all the time.

2262
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:51,990
Friends do all the great
Dutch primatologist who's
responsible for bringing

2263
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:55,200
Benobos to public light to a large extent.

2264
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,020
He said chimps use violence to get sex,

2265
01:06:58,021 --> 01:06:58,620
but no booze.

2266
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,420
Use Sex to avoid violence.

2267
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,850
And bonobos are very
interesting and as you know,

2268
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:10,410
people understand the chimps and Bonobos
are our two closest primate relatives

2269
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:15,540
by far and in fact there
we're more closely related
to them then they are to any

2270
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:17,680
other primates.

2271
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,600
So if you go to a zoo
and you're looking at it,

2272
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:20,710
you know chimp cage,

2273
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,330
that champ is more shares,

2274
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:26,170
more DNA with you than he does with a
gorilla or an orangutan or anything,

2275
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:26,441
right?

2276
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:26,830
Yeah.

2277
01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:27,581
So in fact,

2278
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:31,060
jared diamond wrote a book called the
third chimpanzee where he argued that

2279
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:31,661
humans,

2280
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:35,380
chimps and Bonobos are basically
three subspecies of chimpanzee,

2281
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,270
were so closely related,

2282
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:41,050
were more closely related to them than
an Indian elephant is to an African

2283
01:07:41,051 --> 01:07:41,884
elephant.

2284
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,221
Right.

2285
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:44,320
We're like super close in terms of DNA.

2286
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,251
So they're.

2287
01:07:45,251 --> 01:07:46,900
But they're very close to each other.

2288
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,570
So I think of it as like
if I've got twin brothers,

2289
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:52,060
they're closest to each other,

2290
01:07:52,061 --> 01:07:55,990
but after each other comes me and
I'm equally related to each of them.

2291
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:57,101
So the champ,

2292
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:57,611
as you say,

2293
01:07:57,611 --> 01:08:00,400
it's kind of bad ass kind
of very male dominated,

2294
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:01,750
very hierarchical,

2295
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:05,240
kind of conflictive can be really nasty,

2296
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:05,520
you know,

2297
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,540
rip people's faces off in Connecticut.

2298
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,900
But the Bonobo in 50 years of
observation in the wild and in captivity,

2299
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:19,080
no one has ever seen Urbanova kill or
rape and other Banaba that'll have to

2300
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:19,311
rape.

2301
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:20,600
They just fuck they don't do it.

2302
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:21,920
If you want to not get raped,

2303
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:23,960
just give it up every way you look.

2304
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,603
That's ridiculous.

2305
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,670
Yeah,

2306
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,800
we can never live like them.

2307
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:28,581
I'd say.

2308
01:08:28,581 --> 01:08:29,780
I do not agree with that.

2309
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,070
I'm just saying it in,

2310
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,420
in the animal world,

2311
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:33,291
that's what they do,

2312
01:08:33,291 --> 01:08:33,621
right?

2313
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:33,831
I mean,

2314
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:34,241
that's where they,

2315
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:35,540
they never killed a rapist.

2316
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,650
Very interesting.

2317
01:08:36,770 --> 01:08:38,150
When you're talking about animals,

2318
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:43,180
like a lot of people say that orangutan
sex is rape because the male chases the

2319
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:47,300
female through the tree tops and she's
screaming and apparently trying to get

2320
01:08:47,301 --> 01:08:47,750
away.

2321
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:48,480
Right?

2322
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,230
That's a dolphin three isn't.

2323
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:54,410
There is a indication of Dolphin rave
with dolphins are also involved in mass

2324
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:55,244
genocide.

2325
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,850
Infanticide rather killed baby dolphins.

2326
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:00,740
They kill them to get
the females to breed.

2327
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,280
That's typical of,

2328
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:03,000
of uh,

2329
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,730
a lot of mammals learning ends.

2330
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:05,460
Do that,

2331
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:05,930
do this,

2332
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:06,370
do that.

2333
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:10,880
When there's an Alpha male gorillas
when there's an Alpha male and he takes

2334
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:11,714
over,

2335
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:13,070
often he'll kill the.

2336
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,510
Or if there's a coalition,

2337
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:17,360
they'll kill the babies to get them back.

2338
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,640
The women back into estrous.

2339
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:20,453
It's brutal.

2340
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:21,951
In fact,

2341
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:23,090
that's one of the theories,

2342
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,320
Sarah Hrdy,

2343
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:25,760
who's written widely,

2344
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:28,400
she's very well known
primatologist anthropologist.

2345
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:29,691
One of,

2346
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:30,230
um,

2347
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:34,700
the theories is that the reason that
females are promiscuous in some primate

2348
01:09:34,701 --> 01:09:39,701
species is to confuse paternity so that
males won't be tempted to kill babies in

2349
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:44,210
order to get women back into
a female back into estrous.

2350
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,190
And that's the current
thinking on dolphins as well.

2351
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:46,850
Oh really?

2352
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,240
Yeah.

2353
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,730
Dolphin females are known to
be like the slots of the ocean.

2354
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,251
They have sex,

2355
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:52,400
sex as many guys as possible.

2356
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,250
So the guy comes over,

2357
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,093
he goes,

2358
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,450
yeah.

2359
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:58,190
So while they have that
bond with that person,

2360
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,750
what do they establish as the main
reason why the chimpanzees and Bonobos

2361
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:02,911
though?

2362
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,100
So genetically similar,

2363
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,450
so different behaviorally.

2364
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,890
That's a really good question.

2365
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,753
The,

2366
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,940
there's no perfect theory.

2367
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,920
The best known theory is that,

2368
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,240
um,

2369
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,770
the chimps and Bonobos,

2370
01:10:15,771 --> 01:10:19,190
we're the same species and
there was a change in the Congo,

2371
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:19,820
the,

2372
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,860
the root of the Congo River,

2373
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:25,580
I think about 5 million years
ago and that's been verified.

2374
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:26,840
And uh,

2375
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:31,840
so one population got isolated on the
south side of the Congo and the other on

2376
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:37,100
the north and the ones on
the south became Benobos.

2377
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:40,010
The ones on the north became chimps.

2378
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,020
And the idea,

2379
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:42,920
and this is um,

2380
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:45,200
Richard Wrangham at
Harvard proposed this idea,

2381
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:47,870
is that the chimps on the north,

2382
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:51,290
we're competing with gorillas for
some of the same food sources,

2383
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:54,650
whereas there are no
gorilla south of Congo,

2384
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:57,320
so the Banabos weren't competing
for those food sources,

2385
01:10:57,350 --> 01:10:58,640
so they didn't have to get gangster.

2386
01:10:58,810 --> 01:10:59,643
Right?

2387
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:04,660
But the problem with that theory is that
it basically dismisses the assumptions

2388
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:11,810
of Darwinian evolution based on Malthus,

2389
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,160
which is that any population

2390
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,130
will quickly grow to the point where the,

2391
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:19,650
where the food resources are saturated.

2392
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,700
And so you get competition between
individuals for whatever's there,

2393
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:24,563
right?

2394
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:29,850
He seems to be saying the population of
Banabos never grew to the point where

2395
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:31,200
they were competing for food,

2396
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:34,080
therefore they never
had to get competitive.

2397
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,490
If that's true,

2398
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,290
that's a radical statement.

2399
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,360
It happens to be a statement I agree with.

2400
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,670
I've made the same statement
about early humans.

2401
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,630
I'm saying,

2402
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,871
hey,

2403
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:43,920
early humans were like,

2404
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:44,131
you know,

2405
01:11:44,131 --> 01:11:46,530
these pythons that are
introduced into the everglades.

2406
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:46,891
They're like,

2407
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:47,371
whoa,

2408
01:11:47,371 --> 01:11:50,700
there's nothing else here
competing for this niche.

2409
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,081
Well,

2410
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:54,230
it kind of makes sense if you really
think about it in terms of how we look at

2411
01:11:54,231 --> 01:11:55,011
socialism,

2412
01:11:55,011 --> 01:11:57,920
because what are the number one
complaint from manly man about socialism?

2413
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,300
It's going to make a soft,

2414
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:02,800
which are fucking pussies have
just socialists out there yet.

2415
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,770
That's the idea.

2416
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,790
The idea is to soften everybody the fuck
up to reduce the need of competition

2417
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,200
and to a lot of people,

2418
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:13,310
especially people that have adopted
sort of a advantageous positions,

2419
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,660
they look at that as like,

2420
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:15,220
Hey,

2421
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,100
fucking plus age,

2422
01:12:16,101 --> 01:12:16,934
you gotta earn it.

2423
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:17,480
You know,

2424
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,270
socialism is the idea.

2425
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,970
It sort of makes sense if you
look at the buffalo community,

2426
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,853
right?

2427
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:24,950
Yeah.

2428
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:28,340
They didn't have competition so everybody
just chilled out and they developed a

2429
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:31,010
style of being that's more chilled out.

2430
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:32,230
Right,

2431
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:32,600
right.

2432
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,330
It is a great story.

2433
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,650
I'll tell you a guy you should interview.

2434
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,970
I think I mentioned him last time.

2435
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:37,930
Robert Sapolsky.

2436
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,021
I tried.

2437
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:39,470
I'm trying.

2438
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:40,800
He's in the middle of teaching.

2439
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:41,211
Oh,

2440
01:12:41,211 --> 01:12:41,810
okay.

2441
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:42,643
So you've been in touch

2442
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:44,640
for sure.

2443
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,790
I learned everything about toxo plasma,

2444
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:51,560
which this podcast is for him to death
and they got so tired of talking about

2445
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:52,423
today.

2446
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,140
Do you,

2447
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,350
do you tell the same story?

2448
01:12:54,351 --> 01:12:54,891
Sometimes?

2449
01:12:54,891 --> 01:12:55,071
Yeah.

2450
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:57,020
Sometimes I get tweets from people like,

2451
01:12:57,021 --> 01:12:57,510
dude,

2452
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,690
great,

2453
01:12:57,690 --> 01:12:58,521
love your podcast,

2454
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:00,080
but you told that story three times.

2455
01:13:00,081 --> 01:13:01,310
Like how do you keep track?

2456
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,030
It's really hard when you're having a
guest if the guest is not aware of the

2457
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:07,670
information because I don't want
to like write it down and say,

2458
01:13:07,671 --> 01:13:07,911
okay,

2459
01:13:07,911 --> 01:13:09,710
when the podcast is over
I got to tell you about

2460
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,820
the changes the way you behave.

2461
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:13,460
Um,

2462
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:16,250
so sometimes if it's a new gas
and they don't know about it,

2463
01:13:16,251 --> 01:13:16,730
I kinda,

2464
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:17,810
I'm sort of forced to.

2465
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,670
I tried to give them the
cliff notes version of it.

2466
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:20,870
I know about it.

2467
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:23,210
So pasky had an amazing video,

2468
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:23,710
um,

2469
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:28,370
where he detailed and it even went
into that when he was a med student.

2470
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,760
They would find a cadaver's like guys
who died on motorcycles and there was a

2471
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:39,101
disproportionate amount of them that
tested positive for toxoplasma takers,

2472
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:40,971
risk takers,

2473
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:44,210
that the parasite literally
gets you to take risks.

2474
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:48,620
And that there's a direct correlation
between toxo plasma infestation and

2475
01:13:48,621 --> 01:13:50,090
successful soccer teams.

2476
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,373
Wow.

2477
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,450
So they all have cats in the locker room.

2478
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:53,871
No.

2479
01:13:53,871 --> 01:13:54,081
Well,

2480
01:13:54,081 --> 01:13:55,610
this is two thoughts behind that.

2481
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:57,590
One is it could be purely,

2482
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,880
that doesn't cause it's not,

2483
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:05,881
it's not in the fact that's just a
correlation correlation in that it's just,

2484
01:14:06,951 --> 01:14:09,050
you're dealing with people that
live in impoverished areas.

2485
01:14:09,051 --> 01:14:11,740
People in impoverished areas
have higher incidents of cats,

2486
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:17,050
hired incidences of feral cats is more
likely toxoplasma that they're also more

2487
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:22,051
desperate and maybe more invested in
soccer and more aggressive in their

2488
01:14:22,661 --> 01:14:25,210
approach because it means so much
to them because it's a way out,

2489
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:25,901
you know,

2490
01:14:25,901 --> 01:14:28,780
much like impoverished
people in America sometimes,

2491
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:29,171
you know,

2492
01:14:29,171 --> 01:14:29,471
they,

2493
01:14:29,471 --> 01:14:33,190
they make some of the greatest athletic
stories or someone who came from nothing

2494
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:36,250
and was so never wanted to go back
to that again and had so much drive.

2495
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,460
So I don't know if he can act absolutely
connected two of them together.

2496
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,200
But it is a fascinating theory.

2497
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,590
You

2498
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,300
talking about taking risks.

2499
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,110
Uh,

2500
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,190
as I've gotten older,

2501
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:48,400
I've developed this concept
I call the bucket list.

2502
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,220
So the,

2503
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,490
you know,

2504
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:53,890
the bucket list is stuff you
want to do before you die.

2505
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:54,380
Right.

2506
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,180
But like I turned 51 a couple of weeks
ago and I'm at the stage now where I've

2507
01:14:58,181 --> 01:15:01,390
got a fuck it list were things I used
to think I wanted to do before I die.

2508
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:02,081
And now I'm like,

2509
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:02,260
yeah,

2510
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:02,651
fuck it.

2511
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:03,130
You know,

2512
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,480
like one g jumping.

2513
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:04,711
No,

2514
01:15:04,711 --> 01:15:04,941
no,

2515
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:05,281
no,

2516
01:15:05,281 --> 01:15:05,471
no.

2517
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:05,950
Fuck it.

2518
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,750
That's definitely on a fucking noisy.

2519
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:08,710
Yeah.

2520
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,730
I'll show you a video.

2521
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,440
A Guy Bungee jumps in his,

2522
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,270
his cord was not long enough.

2523
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:15,940
Slice slams off the ground in agony.

2524
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:20,941
And then with the body he has court is
too long ago with his broken body slams

2525
01:15:20,981 --> 01:15:25,540
off the ground again and it does like
several times he's got like a helmet

2526
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:29,500
camera in the screens and
he makes are horrific.

2527
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:30,573
He didn't die.

2528
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,370
He lived because it slowed
him down a little bit,

2529
01:15:33,371 --> 01:15:38,320
but I mean it just broke him and then
spring up in the air and then smashed back

2530
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:39,130
down again.

2531
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:39,281
I mean,

2532
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:41,500
I don't know if he lived after the video,

2533
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:44,170
but he's alive during
the video and it'll cure.

2534
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:45,820
You have any ideas of bungee jumping?

2535
01:15:45,850 --> 01:15:47,320
I hope it wasn't Antosz point.

2536
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:48,154
Oh,

2537
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,510
you probably covered it.

2538
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,220
He's probably got a fucking 10
minutes of his act about it.

2539
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:53,910
Really?

2540
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:54,150
Yeah.

2541
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:54,560
He's,

2542
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:55,391
he's covered everything.

2543
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:55,841
Fucked up.

2544
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:58,210
That's ever been released
on the young Turks.

2545
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,440
He's in the same building.

2546
01:15:59,470 --> 01:15:59,671
Oh,

2547
01:15:59,671 --> 01:15:59,990
isn't it?

2548
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,290
Yeah.

2549
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:00,550
I,

2550
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:05,050
I did a show with Doug Stanhope recently
who went and we did this thing where it

2551
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:08,350
was a guy who was a lifelong
virgin trying to give them advice,

2552
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:11,500
but a bucket list.

2553
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:12,880
That's a good one for the bucket list.

2554
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:14,320
Punchkick just bungee jumping.

2555
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:15,663
Skydiving.

2556
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,080
I could be convinced to skydive
if it was with some friends.

2557
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:21,573
Fuck No.

2558
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,031
Tell him.

2559
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:22,864
Tell him the story.

2560
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:28,290
My Dad was this girl that my dad worked
with skydived all the time and every

2561
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,010
know she always tried to get him to do it.

2562
01:16:30,011 --> 01:16:33,610
So finally he was going to do it and then
like a week before you're supposed to

2563
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:34,140
do it.

2564
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:34,750
Uh,

2565
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,490
she jumped and heard a chute,

2566
01:16:38,491 --> 01:16:38,981
didn't open,

2567
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:42,550
and then the reserve chute start tangling
with the other shooter and then she

2568
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:42,970
died.

2569
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,610
So it's like my dad was supposed to do
it like the following week or something.

2570
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:46,870
We can add that to the fuck.

2571
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:47,950
Fuck it.

2572
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:48,810
That's all she did it.

2573
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:49,530
She was a pro.

2574
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:49,931
It was just,

2575
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:50,340
you know,

2576
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:51,173
a bad shoot.

2577
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,020
I did a hair a.

2578
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,470
I always forget Paris lighting.

2579
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:55,661
What's the difference?

2580
01:16:55,661 --> 01:16:56,750
Parasailing is behind a boat,

2581
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:57,060
right?

2582
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:57,221
Yeah.

2583
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:58,210
No I do paragliding.

2584
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:59,080
Jumping off a mountain.

2585
01:16:59,081 --> 01:16:59,914
Oh my God.

2586
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,450
I did this in indy.

2587
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:02,284
I took,

2588
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:05,050
it was really dumb but cheap.

2589
01:17:05,170 --> 01:17:06,003
It was cheap.

2590
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:06,521
It was.

2591
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,240
So it's your life.

2592
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,410
It was in Goa and there's this German
guy on the beach where I was staying in

2593
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:12,500
this Hippie beach and go,

2594
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:12,561
uh,

2595
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,430
called Aaron Bull.

2596
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:15,080
Whereas Gola go as a,

2597
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,810
the just below Mumbai in India.

2598
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:22,811
It's on the west coast of India and it's
like this legendary hippy place like

2599
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,130
Philips since the sixties.

2600
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:28,100
Hippies have been going there to chill
out on these amazing beaches and small

2601
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,170
cash and you know,

2602
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,470
do yoga and shit.

2603
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:35,180
So I was there for 10 years
ago or something and you know,

2604
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:36,320
we were there for two weeks,

2605
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,150
two months on this beach.

2606
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,010
Like I didn't wear shoes for two months,

2607
01:17:40,011 --> 01:17:43,850
it was just so great and so I was
looking for stuff to do and there's this

2608
01:17:43,851 --> 01:17:47,300
German guy who have a who was teaching,

2609
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:47,640
you know,

2610
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,320
you do these classes and
it was like for 10 jumps,

2611
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,000
100 bucks or something.

2612
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:57,170
So I signed up and you do the first day
theory and you learn like learn some

2613
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:57,771
weird shit.

2614
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:59,150
Like there are these cloud formations,

2615
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:02,810
it'll suck you up into them and when
you're like in the cloud you don't know

2616
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:04,250
what's up and what's down.

2617
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:06,510
And so there are all
these things you like.

2618
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,090
It's like instrument control.

2619
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:09,020
You have to like,

2620
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:11,450
even if you think you're falling upward,

2621
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:13,040
you have to pull the shit and fall.

2622
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:13,520
And it's like,

2623
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:13,641
oh,

2624
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:15,140
that's weird and horrible stuff.

2625
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,400
What is the cloud formation?

2626
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:17,210
That's sucks you up.

2627
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:17,871
What's that all about?

2628
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:18,471
I don't remember.

2629
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,520
I just remember like,

2630
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,150
you know,

2631
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:21,910
I will not go near those clouds.

2632
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:23,600
The wizard of Oz type of situation.

2633
01:18:23,601 --> 01:18:24,210
It was some,

2634
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:28,570
some particular cloud formation that,

2635
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,620
that has a really strong updraft.

2636
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:30,981
It's like,

2637
01:18:30,981 --> 01:18:31,420
um,

2638
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:31,730
you know,

2639
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:34,070
what's it called on the beach
where you get sucked out to ocean,

2640
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,230
the untitled,

2641
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,820
like you have to go against it.

2642
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,180
Not against it die.

2643
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:42,020
I'm 90 degree angle.

2644
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,820
Not trying to get out of it.

2645
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:45,330
Like you don't swim against the undertow,

2646
01:18:45,331 --> 01:18:47,190
you swim across the undertone,

2647
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:47,810
right?

2648
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,790
Same thing in this case
because you get sucked up.

2649
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,600
Your body freezes and then
they'll find you like far,

2650
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:54,350
far away,

2651
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:55,183
frozen,

2652
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:55,761
solid.

2653
01:18:55,761 --> 01:18:58,320
Like it's either the iceman.

2654
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:58,590
Yeah,

2655
01:18:58,590 --> 01:19:00,190
we didn't finish the story.

2656
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:03,370
The reason why this guy didn't
get smushed is because uh,

2657
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,050
he like fell into the bottom of this
crevasse and got covered and turned into a

2658
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:12,830
essentially like frozen dinner
and a mummy frozen mummy.

2659
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:14,860
So if people like,

2660
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:15,361
what the fuck?

2661
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:16,340
He never finished that story.

2662
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,680
Do you know Brad Pitt has a tattoo of it.

2663
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:19,514
See on his arm.

2664
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:21,310
Doesn't really know he's really into etsy.

2665
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:22,160
That's fascinating.

2666
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:22,640
Yeah.

2667
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,473
Why?

2668
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:24,940
I guess he's just super into it.

2669
01:19:24,941 --> 01:19:25,160
So,

2670
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,460
you know,

2671
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,460
maybe we'd have to ask Brad Pitt.

2672
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,650
You've got a better chance of
getting them on the phone the night.

2673
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:31,970
I don't think he talked to me.

2674
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:32,241
I fell.

2675
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:35,330
Oh Shit I've talked about is
perfume ads is it looks bad ass,

2676
01:19:35,331 --> 01:19:38,600
world war z and maybe those perfume
man's fucking do it for me though.

2677
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,473
Have seen them now.

2678
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:44,740
Might be the Douchey is commercial world
has ever known next to Stephen Dorff

2679
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:49,460
electronic cigarette
commercial right there.

2680
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,000
Like what?

2681
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,770
He needs the money.

2682
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:51,050
Well,

2683
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:51,680
you know,

2684
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,270
the only thing that I leave for him,

2685
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:57,800
his maybe he puts that money
to use in some positive way.

2686
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,600
He's very active.

2687
01:19:59,601 --> 01:20:04,490
I know a lot of stuff both
in America and abroad,

2688
01:20:04,491 --> 01:20:05,660
so it could be that,

2689
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,350
you know,

2690
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:09,570
they were going donate a shitload
of money to something and he did it,

2691
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,250
but it's chanel number five.

2692
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,510
It's like such a Dorky,

2693
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:15,030
but it's good to bring this up anyway
because I wanted to talk to you about

2694
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:16,800
perfume because it's fucking hilarious.

2695
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:18,330
Where it all came from.

2696
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:20,070
Oh yeah.

2697
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:20,650
I cover.

2698
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:21,483
This stinks.

2699
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,520
This is not the green.

2700
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:25,730
That commercial using
conjunctive can chunk now.

2701
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:26,490
Oh No,

2702
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:27,130
no,

2703
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:27,280
no,

2704
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:27,420
no.

2705
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:28,570
Put the actual one man.

2706
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:30,540
I don't want to see you.

2707
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,020
GotTa you gotTa.

2708
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:32,160
See his stupid face,

2709
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:33,043
I doing it,

2710
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:34,530
uh,

2711
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:35,563
for the.

2712
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,010
Yeah,

2713
01:20:36,010 --> 01:20:36,930
what's ridiculous.

2714
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:41,130
It's the most ridiculous commercials
of all time because it's a guy who's a

2715
01:20:41,131 --> 01:20:44,730
fucking multimillionaire millionaire
that you noticed and wear the stupid,

2716
01:20:44,731 --> 01:20:45,490
Stinky Shit.

2717
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:49,890
His wife as much money as he does and
he's done a little chanel number five

2718
01:20:49,891 --> 01:20:54,300
commercial and somebody has videos of
him sucking a million bucks or something.

2719
01:20:54,301 --> 01:20:55,170
That's how they did it.

2720
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,760
It's something missing or they,

2721
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:58,281
you know,

2722
01:20:58,281 --> 01:20:59,670
they promise to cure aids.

2723
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,421
This is,

2724
01:21:01,421 --> 01:21:02,470
it really ends.

2725
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,363
But we go on.

2726
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,040
The world turns.

2727
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:07,110
When we turned with it,

2728
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:08,690
the world turns.

2729
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:09,010
We turned.

2730
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:10,270
Plans disappear.

2731
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:12,370
Dreams take over

2732
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:15,820
whenever I go.

2733
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:18,220
There you are.

2734
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,600
I love my faith.

2735
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:26,043
Number five.

2736
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:32,830
That's a fucking goddamn
Saturday night live sketch.

2737
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:33,460
Okay.

2738
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,030
Wow.

2739
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:37,360
That does seem like a parody
of a commercial starring.

2740
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:40,060
It also seems like a
parody of tree of life.

2741
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:41,260
Did you see that movie?

2742
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,680
Yes.

2743
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:41,891
No,

2744
01:21:41,891 --> 01:21:42,371
I didn't know.

2745
01:21:42,371 --> 01:21:45,580
That's the Tom Hanks one with Brad Pitt.

2746
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,650
It's directed by the guy who did the,

2747
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:48,610
uh,

2748
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:50,070
he's a very interesting directory.

2749
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,570
Does like one movie every
10 years or something.

2750
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,800
I can't remember his name right now.

2751
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,780
This is not the interconnected lives.

2752
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:56,970
What does well,

2753
01:21:56,970 --> 01:21:57,180
no,

2754
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,360
that's the atlas.

2755
01:21:58,361 --> 01:21:59,770
The cloud atlas.

2756
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:00,041
Oh,

2757
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:00,370
okay.

2758
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:00,620
Yeah.

2759
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:00,860
Okay.

2760
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:01,450
Yeah.

2761
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:01,661
No,

2762
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:01,961
this,

2763
01:22:01,961 --> 01:22:02,681
this is like,

2764
01:22:02,681 --> 01:22:04,480
it is really trippy though.

2765
01:22:04,481 --> 01:22:05,440
It's like there's all this.

2766
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:07,330
It'll have A.

2767
01:22:07,330 --> 01:22:08,660
Brad Pitt is a father,

2768
01:22:08,661 --> 01:22:10,100
a couple of kids.

2769
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,680
I'm sure most of your listeners
know what I'm talking about it.

2770
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,250
He's a well known director.

2771
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:19,510
He did a really funky movie
about the Pacific Theater,

2772
01:22:19,511 --> 01:22:22,000
World War Two with Sean Penn in it.

2773
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,260
Um,

2774
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:23,590
and,

2775
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:24,423
and um,

2776
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,750
and uh,

2777
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,670
the guy from Saturday night fever,

2778
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:32,100
a gay guy bathhouses dare you,

2779
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,143
the gay guy.

2780
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:35,200
How about the amazing dancer,

2781
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,660
like a really talented
actor from pulp fiction

2782
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:45,330
suck dick and nanosecond to
know who is talking about.

2783
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,380
You were playing charades.

2784
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:48,214
I would applaud.

2785
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:50,561
Anyway.

2786
01:22:50,561 --> 01:22:51,040
Yeah.

2787
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,610
So that was,

2788
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,920
that seemed like a parody of that movie.

2789
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:54,720
There it is,

2790
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,720
like the sun bursting and there's
this real slow visuals and yeah,

2791
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,830
I don't know what the
fucking motivation was,

2792
01:23:02,831 --> 01:23:04,540
but it's preposterous.

2793
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,580
Just completely ridiculous commercial.

2794
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,610
The idea behind the perfume itself,

2795
01:23:09,611 --> 01:23:10,840
it's very fascinating though.

2796
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,400
I don't like it.

2797
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,233
I've never liked it.

2798
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:17,080
I don't mean there's like a couple
like oils that girls can put on.

2799
01:23:17,081 --> 01:23:18,430
I think that smells kind of cool,

2800
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:20,770
but generally I like the
way people smell in a clean,

2801
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:21,340
you know,

2802
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:23,680
and that's why perfume was invented.

2803
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,150
People weren't fucking clean,

2804
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:25,984
they were dirty,

2805
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,210
stinking animals that
we're scared of water.

2806
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:33,420
And that's also why spices
were so valuable during
those centuries of the spice

2807
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:34,000
spices.

2808
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,870
Pepper black pepper was worth more than
because the food was rotting so they

2809
01:23:37,871 --> 01:23:39,250
would spice the shit up.

2810
01:23:39,251 --> 01:23:40,150
So you couldn't taste.

2811
01:23:40,151 --> 01:23:45,151
How horrible did a lot of people die
from horrible digestive issues back then?

2812
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:46,880
Uh,

2813
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:47,880
well yeah.

2814
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:48,940
In the medieval period,

2815
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:52,450
a lot of people were dying from all sorts
of nastiness related to the nastiness

2816
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:52,901
of the food,

2817
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:56,080
but also the fact that they were shitting
in the street and there's no sewage

2818
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:56,914
and everything.

2819
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,030
But what's interesting,

2820
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,360
I think this is like cutting
edge medical research.

2821
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,510
Is that thing still
playing in the background?

2822
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:04,600
In the background there?

2823
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:05,560
Yeah,

2824
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,960
I've heard it since the
movie was on just now.

2825
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,700
What is the for your ipad?

2826
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:13,990
You Fuck Jesus.

2827
01:24:13,991 --> 01:24:14,650
Brian.

2828
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,410
I thought I was going crazy again.

2829
01:24:18,250 --> 01:24:19,110
Uh Oh.

2830
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,430
Is it cutting edge medical
research I think is going to.

2831
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:25,330
You're probably tuned into this because
of the body hacking and all that.

2832
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,650
The,

2833
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:28,540
the microflora of the stomach.

2834
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,130
Yeah.

2835
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,130
Really interesting.

2836
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,120
So in those days people
would have had really robust,

2837
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:34,661
uh,

2838
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:36,940
intestinal flora to deal with all that.

2839
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,530
The bacteria that you're absorbing
your system on a daily basis,

2840
01:24:41,531 --> 01:24:46,531
which dogs have supply dogs drink
water and people who live in India.

2841
01:24:46,631 --> 01:24:47,464
And you know,

2842
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:52,270
I spent a lot of time and I went
swimming in a fucking lake in India.

2843
01:24:52,271 --> 01:24:53,120
I don't know what I was.

2844
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,400
Do not have the science channel.

2845
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:55,570
No.

2846
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:56,500
Do not have discovery.

2847
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:59,530
Do you not watch those things where people
come back with fucking football sized

2848
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:01,630
parasites growing inside
of their head do this,

2849
01:25:01,631 --> 01:25:02,140
was,

2850
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,860
this was a long time ago and I,

2851
01:25:03,960 --> 01:25:05,560
I was young and invincible,

2852
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:06,970
but a lot of stupid shit.

2853
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:07,930
Nothing.

2854
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:11,020
You Got Lucky and I've
been healthy as shit,

2855
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:11,291
you know,

2856
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:13,030
I'm like the guy who never gets sick.

2857
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,021
Maybe that's what it is.

2858
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:14,340
I.

2859
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:14,550
Well,

2860
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:15,850
I think honestly,

2861
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:16,390
I,

2862
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:21,100
when I was traveling a lot in
Asia and Latin American stuff,

2863
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,090
I took a lot of
acidophilus and raw garlic.

2864
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,070
Talk about body smells,

2865
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:27,311
man.

2866
01:25:27,311 --> 01:25:30,760
I ate so much raw garlic and uh,

2867
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:32,740
and the raw garlic is good.

2868
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:35,770
It keeps him skeeto so away they don't
like the smell of garlic and it comes out

2869
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:36,604
through your skin.

2870
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,320
It keeps women away too.

2871
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:40,230
I found I'm not Italian women.

2872
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,820
Yeah.

2873
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,660
This is accepted Italian men.

2874
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:43,503
Keep the Italian.

2875
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,510
But uh,

2876
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:46,931
yeah.

2877
01:25:46,931 --> 01:25:47,741
And I say that,

2878
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:49,180
but the ball show a different story.

2879
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,910
Are we going to put
our balls on the table?

2880
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,273
Italian balls.

2881
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:55,950
The balls are large.

2882
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:57,073
They're the director.

2883
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:59,280
I think it's more of a species.

2884
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:00,850
I mean there is some cultural,

2885
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,740
there is evidence that
Asian balls are smaller.

2886
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,650
Um,

2887
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:07,280
I am started talking Spanish.

2888
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:12,350
They're quite a bit smaller than a black
balls and white balls or somewhere in

2889
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:13,634
the middle

2890
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,220
being very sort of.

2891
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,500
I don't know if that's
politically incorrect to say,

2892
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:19,070
but it's,

2893
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:20,240
it seems to be true.

2894
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:21,980
And my wife has,

2895
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:25,940
I don't think I told you this story last
time because Sylvia was here last time,

2896
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:26,843
um,

2897
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,150
couple of years into our relationship.

2898
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:29,880
Uh,

2899
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:34,060
one night we were hanging out with a
friend in Barcelona smoking a joint and,

2900
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,021
and uh,

2901
01:26:35,021 --> 01:26:35,750
this friend,

2902
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:36,890
he's a funny guy,

2903
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:41,300
he was giving me a hard time by
giving her a hard time essentially.

2904
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,220
And so he was saying about,

2905
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:43,971
Kyla,

2906
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:44,810
you're so innocent,

2907
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:44,991
you know,

2908
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:48,410
you were in medical school and then you
were married all these years and you

2909
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:48,471
know,

2910
01:26:48,471 --> 01:26:50,540
you hook up with Chris when you're 40,

2911
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:51,891
you know,

2912
01:26:51,891 --> 01:26:55,970
you're just starting to see the
world as Chris's corrupting you.

2913
01:26:55,971 --> 01:26:56,750
Right.

2914
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,583
And he said,

2915
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:58,880
you're so innocent,

2916
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,470
you probably think Chris has a big Dick.

2917
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,761
And she said,

2918
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:01,971
well,

2919
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:02,331
no,

2920
01:27:02,331 --> 01:27:02,660
I,

2921
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,850
I've inspected a thousand penises.

2922
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:05,811
And we were like,

2923
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:06,644
well,

2924
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,641
she said,

2925
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:07,881
yeah.

2926
01:27:07,881 --> 01:27:11,180
When I was doing that research for the
World Health Organization in Africa,

2927
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:15,080
I had to inspect the
thousand penises and Vaginas.

2928
01:27:16,330 --> 01:27:16,970
It turns out.

2929
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:17,241
I mean,

2930
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:18,800
I knew she had done this research,

2931
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:21,910
but I didn't know it involved
actually holding the Cox,

2932
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:22,760
you know?

2933
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:23,593
Yeah.

2934
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,370
And so we loved to no gloves,

2935
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,420
gloves,

2936
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,313
gloves,

2937
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:29,870
because account then sort of counts.

2938
01:27:29,871 --> 01:27:30,704
It doesn't matter me.

2939
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,670
I mean if I were going to be
uptight about shit like that,

2940
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:35,061
believe me,

2941
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:36,320
I'd be in a different business,

2942
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:37,580
but a,

2943
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,110
the funny thing was he was like,

2944
01:27:39,111 --> 01:27:39,944
but you know,

2945
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:43,190
she's hot and she was 27
or something at the time.

2946
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:43,911
And you're like,

2947
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:44,960
what about erections?

2948
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:46,130
And she just laughed and she said,

2949
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:46,611
Oh yeah,

2950
01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:47,510
you just flick.

2951
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,980
So Casella sort of like the anti
fluffer she knows how to bring it down.

2952
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,850
There's like you flick right under
the head and the erection is gone

2953
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:56,630
immediately.

2954
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,810
Really try it when you get home.

2955
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:02,330
Sounds annoying just to
annoy the shit out of him.

2956
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:04,900
But somewhere out there there's
a guy that wouldn't stop me.

2957
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,040
I like a little flicking.

2958
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:08,631
So,

2959
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:08,871
uh,

2960
01:28:08,871 --> 01:28:13,130
so she can prove she's one of the
rare individuals that seeing the broad

2961
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:14,240
spectrum of the racist.

2962
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,074
And she says,

2963
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:15,770
well,

2964
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:17,060
she seen a thousand Africans.

2965
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:17,840
It's all apps.

2966
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,730
That was all an hour.

2967
01:28:18,731 --> 01:28:19,120
Okay.

2968
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,390
So it was all African people.

2969
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:22,490
So it's a thousand Africans and me,

2970
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:23,890
that's her,

2971
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:24,740
her pool.

2972
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,190
Oh yeah,

2973
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:26,570
she's not impressed.

2974
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,411
I haven't asked.

2975
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:28,400
I don't even ask.

2976
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:30,560
I don't want to know the answer.

2977
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,333
That's funny.

2978
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,280
What a Douche bag friend you have,

2979
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,293
by the way.

2980
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:38,060
I would cut that guy off
just the way it communicates.

2981
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:39,170
Is he a dickhead?

2982
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:42,110
He's a strange dude actually.

2983
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:45,140
He's a jazz musician who went to,

2984
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:47,840
grew up and went to college
in Philadelphia at Temple,

2985
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:51,110
which is 98 percent black and he's white.

2986
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,760
I'm Jewish.

2987
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:54,560
He's like a hairy dark skin,

2988
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,640
Jewish guys,

2989
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:56,480
big tall guy.

2990
01:28:57,290 --> 01:29:02,290
And he talks like an inner
city Philadelphia black dude
and he sounds wonderful,

2991
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:06,490
but he,

2992
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:07,400
he's not doing it.

2993
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,370
He's not racist.

2994
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,030
Like he just,

2995
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:10,450
he grew up with these guys and,

2996
01:29:10,451 --> 01:29:11,281
and you know,

2997
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:14,280
you learn to sort of communicate
the way your community communicate.

2998
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,640
But it could be awkward because he would,

2999
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:18,503
you know,

3000
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,020
as much as he would use
the n word liberally.

3001
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:22,920
Really?

3002
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,670
Yeah.

3003
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,550
Among like a white crowd or,

3004
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,950
and with his black friends who knew him,

3005
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:33,750
but then it would get weird if we were
at a party or something and he'd be like,

3006
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:34,070
Yo,

3007
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,450
mom was like a fucking idiot.

3008
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:38,720
What are you hanging out with
this guy for a long time?

3009
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,490
Making fun of you

3010
01:29:39,490 --> 01:29:42,700
for having a regular size to your wife.

3011
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,091
What?

3012
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:45,220
Did douchebag dropping bombs.

3013
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:45,641
Yeah,

3014
01:29:45,641 --> 01:29:46,550
bring them to my parties.

3015
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:47,110
Yeah,

3016
01:29:47,110 --> 01:29:48,160
sounds like a treat.

3017
01:29:48,340 --> 01:29:51,880
He knows I love white
guys who talk black to.

3018
01:29:51,881 --> 01:29:52,151
Oh,

3019
01:29:52,151 --> 01:29:53,300
one of my favorite things.

3020
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,180
Can't get enough of them in my life.

3021
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:57,220
That's what you really want to go to.

3022
01:29:57,221 --> 01:29:58,810
If you're really confused about the world.

3023
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,940
He needs a confidant.

3024
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:00,400
Need someone?

3025
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:00,490
Yeah.

3026
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:02,350
You to go to a white guy who talks black.

3027
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:03,273
Yeah,

3028
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:04,870
but I mean it happens.

3029
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:05,321
Hey,

3030
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:08,920
look at all these kids with their pants
hanging down around their asses and

3031
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,530
showing gang signs and you know,

3032
01:30:11,650 --> 01:30:13,480
flicker photos and what are you doing?

3033
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:14,403
That pants

3034
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,650
hanging around your.

3035
01:30:15,651 --> 01:30:17,240
Your ass means one thing.

3036
01:30:17,241 --> 01:30:22,241
You don't know how to check leg kicks
because I guarantee you one more tie at

3037
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,031
all.

3038
01:30:23,031 --> 01:30:24,790
You wouldn't have your
fucking pants hamper.

3039
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,140
Your someone who's just
going to kick your legs.

3040
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:28,400
There's nothing you can do about it.

3041
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:29,730
Your buckles over your Dick.

3042
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:30,680
He can't move your hips.

3043
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:31,260
Right?

3044
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:32,100
Going to get into,

3045
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,130
what did you say?

3046
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:37,340
Look at those kids with their baggy
pants and their liquor photos,

3047
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:45,680
the gang signs and their flicker
for the gang signs in their flicker,

3048
01:30:46,860 --> 01:30:47,480
flicker.

3049
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,420
They really put the gang signs online
and you see these kids from Pacific

3050
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:52,254
palisades.

3051
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,783
It's like

3052
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:56,220
there is an issue with that.

3053
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:00,060
Those kids that grow up in those
really rich places where they want to

3054
01:31:00,061 --> 01:31:04,380
overcompensate because of the fact that
their parents are so not street and they

3055
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:07,380
get like inner mixed with inner city kids.

3056
01:31:07,381 --> 01:31:10,710
They get shipped there and then they
want to prove their worth and I actually

3057
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:13,570
had a friend who had a kid who went to a,

3058
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:17,140
one of those Pacific
Pacific palisades or Malibu,

3059
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:19,230
but one of those high
schools and he's like,

3060
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,510
you'd be fucking amazing how bad it was.

3061
01:31:21,511 --> 01:31:24,570
They had to pull the kid out of there
because there's constant drugs and

3062
01:31:24,571 --> 01:31:29,460
violence and chaos and craziness and the
all a massive amount of kids in those

3063
01:31:29,790 --> 01:31:30,900
areas that grow up.

3064
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:31,530
And I.

3065
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:32,880
It kind of makes sense
if you think about it,

3066
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,160
is people that have a fuckload of money,

3067
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,170
a lot of them also,

3068
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:41,660
they have issues with pills where
they have pills at home or um,

3069
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:42,190
there,

3070
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:44,300
there's a shallow sort of,

3071
01:31:44,301 --> 01:31:44,550
um,

3072
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,920
materialistic vibe to the family and uh,

3073
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:48,591
it gets,

3074
01:31:48,591 --> 01:31:52,530
it gets distributed to the kids and then
the kids start doing a lot of pills.

3075
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,530
It's like it was Malibu or
one of those high schools.

3076
01:31:55,531 --> 01:31:56,670
I can't really wish I could remember,

3077
01:31:56,671 --> 01:31:57,980
but they were snorting oxies.

3078
01:31:58,170 --> 01:31:59,320
It was like a big issue.

3079
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:00,070
You

3080
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,490
know,

3081
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:02,140
I've heard about that
in thousand oaks too,

3082
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:04,480
that they have a problem with the girls.

3083
01:32:04,481 --> 01:32:08,410
Dylan has been quite a few girls
that have gotten in trouble for doing

3084
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,460
oxycontin's.

3085
01:32:09,950 --> 01:32:14,140
They're doing heroin and they're doing
it in high school and these are really

3086
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,460
wealthy neighborhoods,

3087
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:16,420
wealthy areas.

3088
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:19,600
But these people probably never
around for their fucking kids.

3089
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,390
And if you've got enough
money to buy $9,000,000 house,

3090
01:32:22,391 --> 01:32:23,500
you work your Dick off,

3091
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:24,010
you know,

3092
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:25,780
you probably are not around that much.

3093
01:32:25,860 --> 01:32:26,440
Yeah.

3094
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,150
I don't see how kids
are raised by Nannies.

3095
01:32:28,530 --> 01:32:29,363
Many cases.

3096
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,461
Yeah.

3097
01:32:30,461 --> 01:32:35,461
Especially in those dual career household
when your wife works her ass off as

3098
01:32:36,221 --> 01:32:36,940
well,

3099
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:40,300
you're both working your ass off all
day and then you're trying to become

3100
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:42,820
parents at night and it's a fucking grind.

3101
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:44,560
That's a hard grind.

3102
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,161
You know,

3103
01:32:45,161 --> 01:32:46,450
if you leased a lot of poor people,

3104
01:32:46,451 --> 01:32:48,160
they involve their families in that grind,

3105
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:48,370
you know,

3106
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:50,160
they bring in the grandmother or you know,

3107
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,440
they live in a neighborhood where a lot
of family members nearby and they can

3108
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:56,140
sort of take turns taking care
of all the children together,

3109
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:00,010
which actually turned out to be healthier
as long as it's not a high crime area

3110
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:00,470
on that.

3111
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:02,560
See that relates back to three history.

3112
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:03,180
Yeah.

3113
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:03,610
You know,

3114
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:07,510
this whole idea and Kasota grew up in
Mozambique and she talked about like,

3115
01:33:07,530 --> 01:33:07,930
you know,

3116
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:10,240
at night and nobody worried
about where you were.

3117
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:12,460
Your parents didn't worry about
where you are wherever you were.

3118
01:33:12,461 --> 01:33:13,540
Somebody there are some adults,

3119
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:15,060
they're taking care of you being cool,

3120
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,903
you know,

3121
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:19,330
you could eat dinner at somebody else's
house and come home later or sleep

3122
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:19,541
there.

3123
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:20,890
You look for like whatever.

3124
01:33:20,891 --> 01:33:21,401
It sounds.

3125
01:33:21,401 --> 01:33:22,000
So unity,

3126
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,900
Utopian.

3127
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:23,950
Yeah.

3128
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:24,431
But yet,

3129
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:26,440
not because nobody wants
to live in Mozambique,

3130
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:27,251
you know,

3131
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:28,680
no one here happened in math.

3132
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:29,501
You say that,

3133
01:33:29,501 --> 01:33:29,891
oh,

3134
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:32,440
but it's the Brazil in
Beverly Hills and say,

3135
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:32,950
Hey,

3136
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,390
who wants to go to Mozambique?

3137
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:35,230
They going to go,

3138
01:33:35,230 --> 01:33:35,531
bitch,

3139
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:36,364
are you crazy?

3140
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,630
I'm not going to move to Mozambique.

3141
01:33:38,670 --> 01:33:39,610
I speech and you're like,

3142
01:33:39,611 --> 01:33:41,860
you could just let your kids
go and no one needs to worry.

3143
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:42,070
Like,

3144
01:33:42,070 --> 01:33:42,903
fuck you.

3145
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:45,490
What are you going to let your
kids go at night in Africa?

3146
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:46,910
Are you fucking crazy?

3147
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:49,180
No one's gonna believe that's the truth,

3148
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:49,480
man.

3149
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,470
So what is it like you said,

3150
01:33:50,471 --> 01:33:51,370
it's like the Brazil.

3151
01:33:51,371 --> 01:33:52,540
I haven't been to Mozambique.

3152
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,433
So you're talking shit,

3153
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:54,161
I'm talking shit.

3154
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:59,080
But my wife grew up there so I hear a
lot about it and she was just there a

3155
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,020
couple months ago and she said,

3156
01:34:00,021 --> 01:34:02,170
and it's like eight
percent economic growth.

3157
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,460
It's Africa is booming right now because
the Chinese are buying up all the

3158
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:08,830
natural resources that buying up land.

3159
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:09,664
It's,

3160
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:10,630
it's happening.

3161
01:34:10,750 --> 01:34:11,583
Wow.

3162
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:12,130
Yeah.

3163
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:12,963
In Mozambique's,

3164
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:14,080
you know,

3165
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,630
famous for their amazing
beaches and seafood.

3166
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:17,200
And it's,

3167
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,630
it's like a pretty raw,

3168
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,430
beautiful spot on earth.

3169
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:22,640
Wow.

3170
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,473
Yeah.

3171
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:23,770
Yeah.

3172
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:25,320
Africa is a trip you fucking place,

3173
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,840
man.

3174
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:29,050
The idea of leaving the kids
just wandering around and
Africa are two lions and

3175
01:34:29,051 --> 01:34:29,884
Mozambique.

3176
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:30,281
Yeah.

3177
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:30,641
In fact,

3178
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:31,360
she had a.

3179
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,800
She had a German shepherd

3180
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:38,620
who got that got eaten by
a lion when she was a kid.

3181
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,070
Rice.

3182
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:41,500
Yeah.

3183
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:45,200
Mountain lions are scary lions
way scarier than mountain lion.

3184
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:47,230
Nobody gets away from the lines.

3185
01:34:47,231 --> 01:34:49,390
But you know what kills
most people in Africa?

3186
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,560
Hippo fucking ants over.

3187
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:54,670
Really answer a motherfucker.

3188
01:34:54,671 --> 01:34:55,530
That's not a good way to.

3189
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:57,501
There's video.

3190
01:34:57,501 --> 01:35:01,880
I saw once of ants eating an elephant
and they were going up the elephant's leg

3191
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:02,780
into its ear.

3192
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:03,770
Oh No.

3193
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,020
And they were essentially
attacking this elephant,

3194
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:07,340
eating an ear first,

3195
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,110
just going right through the ear.

3196
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,840
And there wasn't a Goddamn thing
the elephant can do to stop it.

3197
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:12,880
Oh man,

3198
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,680
that's not in Alaska.

3199
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:17,070
You get that with mosquito.

3200
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:17,961
Yeah,

3201
01:35:17,961 --> 01:35:20,790
I've seen that on a horrible.

3202
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:22,130
I've never experienced it live,

3203
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:23,180
but I've watched those,

3204
01:35:23,181 --> 01:35:23,720
um,

3205
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,390
those Alaska sustenance shows those.

3206
01:35:26,391 --> 01:35:26,870
Um,

3207
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,830
have you ever seen those shows?

3208
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:29,200
Saw one or two.

3209
01:35:29,201 --> 01:35:29,591
Yeah.

3210
01:35:29,591 --> 01:35:31,600
Where they put these like a reality.

3211
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:31,960
No,

3212
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:32,200
no,

3213
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:32,341
no,

3214
01:35:32,341 --> 01:35:32,461
no,

3215
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:32,551
no,

3216
01:35:32,551 --> 01:35:32,741
no.

3217
01:35:32,741 --> 01:35:34,690
These are actually people that live there.

3218
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:36,000
They're uh,

3219
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:37,390
they're these people that.

3220
01:35:37,510 --> 01:35:39,370
There's a bunch of different ones.

3221
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:43,710
There's one of them's called Yukon
man and the other one's called Alaska,

3222
01:35:43,711 --> 01:35:44,950
the last frontier and,

3223
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:49,240
and they're essentially these people
that live in these very small hunting

3224
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:49,990
communities,

3225
01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:51,370
hunting fishing communities,

3226
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:56,200
and they make no income other than furs
that they occasionally get and they have

3227
01:35:56,201 --> 01:36:00,220
three months of summer where they're
all just frantically trying to gather up

3228
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:02,980
resources and then they
locked down for seven,

3229
01:36:02,981 --> 01:36:03,191
eight,

3230
01:36:03,191 --> 01:36:04,024
nine months.

3231
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,100
It's crazy to watch.

3232
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:08,050
And these people in the summertime,

3233
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:11,530
they're dealing with fucking
swarms of mosquitoes,

3234
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:13,330
like aggressive,

3235
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:15,090
desperate mosquitoes.

3236
01:36:15,091 --> 01:36:18,670
They're like an inch across and they
know they only have a couple of months so

3237
01:36:18,671 --> 01:36:19,510
they just go for it.

3238
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:20,551
Yeah,

3239
01:36:20,551 --> 01:36:21,570
I remember,

3240
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,250
you know when the dusk,

3241
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:26,070
when the mosquitoes come
out and you can see a swarm,

3242
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:28,380
you're setting up your tent,

3243
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:28,801
you know.

3244
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:29,581
And like,

3245
01:36:29,581 --> 01:36:34,581
I remember setting up my tent and like
every second moving my shirts so they

3246
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:36,690
couldn't get in through the shirt,

3247
01:36:36,691 --> 01:36:36,901
you know,

3248
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:38,860
I had to keep moving the shirt
while I'm setting up the tent.

3249
01:36:38,861 --> 01:36:40,860
And then you get in
there and you can hear.

3250
01:36:40,890 --> 01:36:43,530
It's like hail banging against
the side of the tenant.

3251
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,480
You can hear them banging on the tent.

3252
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,381
Oh my God.

3253
01:36:46,381 --> 01:36:46,640
Yeah,

3254
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:47,473
they're,

3255
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,630
they're little helicopter.

3256
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,760
What the fuck did people do
before they figured out tense?

3257
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:52,500
Uh,

3258
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:53,430
well the Eskimos,

3259
01:36:53,431 --> 01:36:57,390
I believe that they smeared
fat on their skin that would,

3260
01:36:57,450 --> 01:37:00,990
certain kinds of fat would keep the
mosquitoes off them and they've got all

3261
01:37:00,991 --> 01:37:03,930
sorts of really clever adaptations,

3262
01:37:03,931 --> 01:37:04,764
you know,

3263
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:05,221
you know,

3264
01:37:05,221 --> 01:37:05,401
we,

3265
01:37:05,401 --> 01:37:08,010
we sort of assume that
we would be helpless,

3266
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:11,430
but that's because we didn't grow
up there and our culture didn't,

3267
01:37:11,431 --> 01:37:12,220
you know.

3268
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:13,053
So there's,

3269
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:14,930
you know who Wade Davis is a,

3270
01:37:14,970 --> 01:37:15,420
he's a,

3271
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:16,950
he's an anthropologist.

3272
01:37:16,951 --> 01:37:17,910
He's written a bunch of books.

3273
01:37:17,911 --> 01:37:18,900
Really interesting guy.

3274
01:37:18,901 --> 01:37:23,901
He's like anthropologists in residence
at the Smithsonian in Washington.

3275
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:27,660
He wrote a book called the wayfarers
I think was his last book about

3276
01:37:27,690 --> 01:37:28,523
traditional,

3277
01:37:28,740 --> 01:37:28,921
like,

3278
01:37:28,921 --> 01:37:31,800
about how these guys could
navigate across the Pacific,

3279
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:36,330
just looking at the stars and the color
of the water and smelling and whatever

3280
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,193
they'd.

3281
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:37,831
Anyway,

3282
01:37:37,831 --> 01:37:38,191
he,

3283
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:38,490
uh,

3284
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,650
one of the stories he tells us about this,

3285
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:41,460
uh,

3286
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:42,420
Eskimo guy,

3287
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:47,640
old guy and the family sort of took
the keys to the car away from him.

3288
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:49,250
Like you can't go anymore.

3289
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:54,090
They were afraid he would go out and die
the traditional way when Eskimo people

3290
01:37:54,091 --> 01:37:54,750
got old,

3291
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:57,180
they would like wander
off into the ice and die.

3292
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,430
So as not to be a burden to the family.

3293
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:00,240
Right.

3294
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:04,470
And he was a traditional guy and they
were worried that he would take the snow

3295
01:38:04,471 --> 01:38:07,800
machine out and just die out there
somewhere or hurt himself hunting or

3296
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:08,634
whatever.

3297
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:12,000
So they had this whole intervention.

3298
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:14,790
And so that night he goes out,

3299
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:16,320
gets out of the house,

3300
01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:18,840
takes a shit in his hand,

3301
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,750
forms the shit into a knife,

3302
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:26,751
blade spits on it and the spit is
freezing along the edge and he hones that

3303
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:29,941
down.

3304
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:32,400
So he gets a nice sharp
edge with his sped,

3305
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:34,800
takes his shit knife,

3306
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:40,160
kills a dog or a couple of dogs and takes
their ribs and makes us a sled out of

3307
01:38:42,301 --> 01:38:42,960
it.

3308
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,050
And with the sinews and whatever
other pieces of the dogs,

3309
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:46,231
you know,

3310
01:38:46,231 --> 01:38:48,060
he knew all this stuff from his childhood,

3311
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:51,970
hooks up a couple of other dogs to
the sled and he takes off into this,

3312
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,940
into the snow on his,

3313
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:55,213
you know,

3314
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:56,880
sled with his shit knife.

3315
01:38:56,940 --> 01:38:57,773
Wow.

3316
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:00,510
Oh my God.

3317
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:02,820
That might be the most of the
same story I've ever heard.

3318
01:39:02,821 --> 01:39:03,780
And they're so clever.

3319
01:39:03,781 --> 01:39:05,280
You know how they killed polar bears.

3320
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,250
I know they take blood
and put it on a blade.

3321
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,430
I know that method.

3322
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:10,440
That was actually wolves.

3323
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,970
The wolves would lick the blade and uh,

3324
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:15,271
we would,

3325
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:15,660
uh,

3326
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,040
they would cut themselves to death,

3327
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,360
similar kind of thing.

3328
01:39:18,361 --> 01:39:20,130
What they would do is they take a little,

3329
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,940
they'd make a wooden box
and they would take a seal,

3330
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,670
a rib and sharpen the
two ends of the seal rib.

3331
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:28,060
And they're pretty flexible.

3332
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:30,090
They bend it and stick it into the box,

3333
01:39:30,091 --> 01:39:30,660
right?

3334
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:35,650
And then they'd pour melted fat into the
box and let it solidify freeze and then

3335
01:39:35,651 --> 01:39:36,510
they knock it out.

3336
01:39:36,511 --> 01:39:41,511
So you've got a fat cube with this
flexed to bladed thing inside it.

3337
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:43,170
And they leave that in the snow.

3338
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,130
Polar bear come along,

3339
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:44,791
swallow it,

3340
01:39:44,791 --> 01:39:46,800
and opens in the polar bear.

3341
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:47,491
Wow.

3342
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:50,010
And they just follow the blood
drops and it would kill them.

3343
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:50,440
Yeah.

3344
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:52,140
Because internal hemorrhaging.

3345
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:53,880
How long did it take to kill him?

3346
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:54,733
I Dunno,

3347
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:56,610
I just remember that.

3348
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:57,330
I mean,

3349
01:39:57,330 --> 01:39:58,710
there are stories like
that all over the world.

3350
01:39:58,711 --> 01:39:58,891
You know,

3351
01:39:58,891 --> 01:40:00,150
the Indian monkey trap,

3352
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,160
the East Indian monkey.

3353
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:02,013
No,

3354
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:07,170
I don't know how interested your readers
or your listeners that system is.

3355
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:08,630
And this is a good metaphor to.

3356
01:40:08,631 --> 01:40:09,600
I always remember this one.

3357
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,160
They would take,

3358
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:11,760
um,

3359
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,271
same thing,

3360
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:17,271
take a box with a hole about a little
smaller than a fist in the Mug,

3361
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,880
in the box.

3362
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:25,440
And they put a mango in the box and
then hammer it shot and tight to a tree.

3363
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,300
So the mango starts rotting,

3364
01:40:27,301 --> 01:40:28,300
the monkey smells it.

3365
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:29,131
Monkey comes along,

3366
01:40:29,131 --> 01:40:32,100
can stick his hand in and feel the mango,

3367
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:36,720
but he can't get his hand out as long
as he's holding onto the mango and they

3368
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:38,010
won't let go of the mango.

3369
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,680
All they have to do is let
go and they could leave,

3370
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:43,650
but they've got the mango in
their hands and they won't let go.

3371
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:46,050
And so the guy comes
around to check the traps.

3372
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:48,270
There's the monkey standing
there with his hand in the box.

3373
01:40:48,271 --> 01:40:48,961
Hit It on the head.

3374
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:49,794
You got your monkey.

3375
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,790
Whoa.

3376
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,710
So it was something about greed there.

3377
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:55,810
That's an awesome story.

3378
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,630
That is a perfect metaphor to.

3379
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:58,270
Yeah,

3380
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,200
that's amazing.

3381
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:00,191
Wow.

3382
01:41:00,191 --> 01:41:01,210
Let go of the mango.

3383
01:41:01,211 --> 01:41:02,140
That's my advice.

3384
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:02,621
Yeah,

3385
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:03,340
that's a good.

3386
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:04,240
That should be a t shirt.

3387
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:06,760
Not a bumper sticker.

3388
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,740
A bumper sticker.

3389
01:41:08,741 --> 01:41:10,750
Bad showed good shit.

3390
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:11,890
It's a better bumper.

3391
01:41:11,891 --> 01:41:12,611
He said Shit.

3392
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:14,500
Knife is a crazy story.

3393
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,620
The guy killed a dog with
a frozen piece of shit.

3394
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:19,780
How stupid was that?

3395
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:20,623
Dog

3396
01:41:22,700 --> 01:41:23,890
was sleeping there.

3397
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:24,671
This guy came up,

3398
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:25,120
my man,

3399
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,800
he got shit,

3400
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,340
man.

3401
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:27,750
What the fuck are you doing?

3402
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:28,660
Dogs Love Shit.

3403
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:30,160
Where you at?

3404
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:33,390
Where are you going to talk people into
shitting in their hand or stuff like

3405
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:33,670
that.

3406
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:35,140
Wasn't that one of your,

3407
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:35,974
um,

3408
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,110
I forgot I did.

3409
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:38,140
I talked to you about this.

3410
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,001
No,

3411
01:41:39,001 --> 01:41:39,460
no.

3412
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:40,290
Um,

3413
01:41:40,290 --> 01:41:41,410
I believe you talked to Duncan.

3414
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:42,530
Okay.

3415
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:43,070
All right.

3416
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:43,903
Yeah.

3417
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:45,860
We were talking about um,

3418
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,820
about wiping,

3419
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:54,210
wiping yourself and about how weird it
is that we sort of like smudge tissue

3420
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:56,110
over our assholes after we shit.

3421
01:41:56,140 --> 01:42:00,220
And then in other countries that we
consider these people to be savage,

3422
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:02,020
they wash their hand,

3423
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,440
you know,

3424
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:05,170
and they wash their ass with their
hand and water and we'd like that.

3425
01:42:05,171 --> 01:42:06,640
It's fucking crazy.

3426
01:42:06,641 --> 01:42:07,121
Yeah,

3427
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:07,930
exactly.

3428
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:11,200
And it's the reason why your left hand
is the inappropriate hand to shake hands

3429
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:13,720
with and already in the Arab and.

3430
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,623
Yeah.

3431
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,520
And that they,

3432
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,670
they always clean with their left hand.

3433
01:42:18,270 --> 01:42:20,510
The Shit experiment.

3434
01:42:20,550 --> 01:42:21,850
Did you actually make people do that?

3435
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:22,890
I didn't know.

3436
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,860
Know what happened.

3437
01:42:23,861 --> 01:42:27,370
I pussied out to fucking Ted again
to ted get involved with bitches.

3438
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:28,241
No balls.

3439
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:29,074
No Shit.

3440
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:30,223
You're out of here.

3441
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:31,330
Do you want in the call?

3442
01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:32,223
Yes or no?

3443
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:37,120
It just took down a couple more
videos recently of WHO's here,

3444
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:38,223
I'll find it,

3445
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:43,390
but then they put the hancock
and sheldrake ones back
up on the different part

3446
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:44,224
of the site.

3447
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:45,730
He ever took them down.

3448
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,271
Totally.

3449
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:50,200
They took them off of one part and they
put it on another part and they put it

3450
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:55,200
up with a disclaimer because they
felt like that there was poor science.

3451
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:55,811
There was bad,

3452
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,070
so pseudo science,

3453
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,760
which if if the scientists
can prove it makes sense,

3454
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,320
but I think that if you.

3455
01:43:05,321 --> 01:43:09,250
You're going to invite someone to talk
and you're going to say that they have

3456
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:10,173
pseudoscience.

3457
01:43:10,390 --> 01:43:14,650
I said at the very least you
should allow them to have a,

3458
01:43:14,651 --> 01:43:17,350
an appropriate response
or allow them to a debate.

3459
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,140
You know them on the
merits of this science.

3460
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:20,770
Exactly.

3461
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:22,270
Because I don't know who's
right or who's wrong.

3462
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:22,481
Well,

3463
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:25,720
the anonymous scientific
panel that they use,

3464
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:30,220
that's what I think is bullshit because
they've got a lot of mainstream people

3465
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:31,420
who are going to say,

3466
01:43:31,421 --> 01:43:31,841
you know,

3467
01:43:31,841 --> 01:43:34,060
whatever Iowasca is bullshit,

3468
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:35,890
but you know,

3469
01:43:35,891 --> 01:43:38,530
let let sheldrake debate that.

3470
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:40,090
Or in that case it was hancock.

3471
01:43:40,091 --> 01:43:41,560
I think he was talking about Iowasca,

3472
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:42,191
you know,

3473
01:43:42,191 --> 01:43:45,250
or get a Andrew Weil who's an expert,

3474
01:43:45,251 --> 01:43:48,460
ms or a way Davis Actually
Wade Davis and Andrew,

3475
01:43:48,461 --> 01:43:50,620
while we're both graduate students,

3476
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:52,530
have Richard Evans

3477
01:43:52,530 --> 01:43:53,363
shelties,

3478
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:56,730
who was probably the most important

3479
01:43:58,240 --> 01:43:59,073
bio,

3480
01:43:59,310 --> 01:43:59,611
sorry,

3481
01:43:59,611 --> 01:44:01,620
botanist of the 20th century.

3482
01:44:01,621 --> 01:44:06,621
He's the one who discovered the plants
behind and named the plants behind

3483
01:44:06,631 --> 01:44:07,870
Iowasca and La.

3484
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:10,290
He did his graduate work on God.

3485
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:11,670
He never.

3486
01:44:11,671 --> 01:44:14,070
He was a very sort of
straight guy himself.

3487
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:15,630
He never took any of this stuff,

3488
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:19,350
but he discovered dozens of
psychoactive plants in the Amazon.

3489
01:44:19,351 --> 01:44:20,220
He was down there like 20 years

3490
01:44:20,240 --> 01:44:21,073
years.

3491
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:22,630
That sounds all great.

3492
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:22,841
I mean,

3493
01:44:22,841 --> 01:44:26,980
that's absolutely great for expanding
people's knowledge on the subject,

3494
01:44:26,981 --> 01:44:29,020
but in their particular situation,

3495
01:44:29,021 --> 01:44:32,140
what was kind of disturbing
was that on the website of Ted,

3496
01:44:32,170 --> 01:44:36,220
the accusations that they had or the
reasons that they had for censoring

3497
01:44:36,221 --> 01:44:37,180
Hancock's work,

3498
01:44:37,630 --> 01:44:39,700
he asked them specifically
site where I said,

3499
01:44:39,701 --> 01:44:41,160
this site where I apply this,

3500
01:44:41,161 --> 01:44:42,070
this is not what I said.

3501
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:47,230
So he was saying that they sort of made
this justification that didn't sort of

3502
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:49,000
jive with his talk.

3503
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:50,890
Now Rupert Sheldrake,

3504
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:55,150
who I think is a bit more
controversial in his,

3505
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:56,050
his statements,

3506
01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:56,800
what,

3507
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:01,800
what Hancock is trying to say is that
Iowasca has had this profound effect on

3508
01:45:02,441 --> 01:45:06,670
humanity and it's based on his own
actual personal experiences taking it,

3509
01:45:06,940 --> 01:45:08,920
the experiences of other
people that have taken it.

3510
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:09,760
The I,

3511
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:14,760
the idea being that this indigenous
population was not the only peoples that

3512
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:16,810
have discovered psychedelic plants,

3513
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:21,190
but then in fact there's a cave art
that details people in altered states of

3514
01:45:21,191 --> 01:45:25,030
consciousness also details what they
believe to be certain psychedelic

3515
01:45:25,031 --> 01:45:29,380
substances and that it's most
likely responsible for a lot of art.

3516
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,280
Um,

3517
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,560
and I think that's a pretty
reasonable thing to say.

3518
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:33,970
And if you don't think it's reasonable,

3519
01:45:33,971 --> 01:45:38,770
the only thing I could say is I doubt
you've had any psychedelic experiences

3520
01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:42,770
because psychedelic experiences would
be incredibly profound to monitor

3521
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:45,310
primitive man and to state any best.

3522
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:48,160
Seems to me that you're not being honest.

3523
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,300
You're ignorant.

3524
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:52,840
You're either ignorant to the effects of
these things or you're not being honest

3525
01:45:52,841 --> 01:45:55,690
about the effects of these things because
you're worried about the perception

3526
01:45:55,900 --> 01:45:58,630
that mainstream academia,

3527
01:45:58,690 --> 01:46:00,760
that most people in the media,

3528
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:03,010
when you start talking about mushrooms,

3529
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:04,330
they think you're a silly person.

3530
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:05,730
You're a fool is again,

3531
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:05,920
right?

3532
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,020
That's the institution determining
the information that's allowed to flow

3533
01:46:10,021 --> 01:46:11,250
through that institution.

3534
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:11,911
Yeah.

3535
01:46:11,911 --> 01:46:12,750
I interviewed,

3536
01:46:12,751 --> 01:46:13,140
um,

3537
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:16,150
Charles grobe a couple of
weeks ago who was at Ucla.

3538
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:21,151
He's a psychiatrist at Ucla who uses a
silicide and I think he's also used mgma

3539
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:27,740
in psychotherapy with people who
have end stage cancer to help them.

3540
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:33,770
It's been very effective in helping them
deal with the fear of death because of

3541
01:46:33,781 --> 01:46:38,460
the sort of transcendent transcendent
experience that often accompanies these

3542
01:46:38,461 --> 01:46:39,294
substances.

3543
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:42,760
They feel a sense of
union with the university.

3544
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:44,100
They lose a lot of that,

3545
01:46:44,101 --> 01:46:44,371
you know,

3546
01:46:44,371 --> 01:46:47,670
I'm just my body feeling which
helps them deal with death.

3547
01:46:47,850 --> 01:46:50,070
So transfer that to what saying about

3548
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,400
I'm a hunter gatherer.

3549
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:55,680
People are pre agricultural people around
the world or post agricultural people

3550
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:57,180
so much in India and,

3551
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,191
and a lot of,

3552
01:46:58,191 --> 01:46:58,430
uh,

3553
01:46:58,430 --> 01:46:58,730
the,

3554
01:46:58,730 --> 01:46:59,760
the ulysses,

3555
01:46:59,761 --> 01:47:00,451
you know,

3556
01:47:00,451 --> 01:47:02,420
the Elisa and fields in ancient Greeks.

3557
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,700
A lot of these rituals
were apparently based on,

3558
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,530
um,

3559
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,740
Amanita Muscarella,

3560
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:10,440
which is a highly hallucinogenic.

3561
01:47:10,441 --> 01:47:14,220
It's the red mushroom with the
white spots in Alice in wonderland.

3562
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:14,611
And Yeah,

3563
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:15,090
silence,

3564
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,360
Santa Claus connection.

3565
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:17,451
Very famous.

3566
01:47:17,451 --> 01:47:18,284
Exactly.

3567
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:20,360
The AMANITA Mascara is.

3568
01:47:20,361 --> 01:47:21,710
So has that been proven?

3569
01:47:21,711 --> 01:47:22,140
Is that.

3570
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:22,441
No,

3571
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:22,950
that's,

3572
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:26,550
it's a theory that was
proposed by Gordon Wasson who,

3573
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,170
um,

3574
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:27,270
uh,

3575
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,450
this is all stuff you can
like mind Stanley on Saturday,

3576
01:47:30,451 --> 01:47:31,284
he was like,

3577
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:35,190
Stanley met a woman,

3578
01:47:35,191 --> 01:47:39,330
the Shaman in Mexico who brought
mushrooms into the Western world.

3579
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,120
I'm Maria Sabina.

3580
01:47:42,121 --> 01:47:42,571
Maria,

3581
01:47:42,571 --> 01:47:42,871
I think.

3582
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:43,640
Is there any,

3583
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:43,850
um,

3584
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:46,620
any way that the point
I was making is that,

3585
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:47,340
you know,

3586
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:52,340
here's this guy using this stuff to
alleviate the fear of death with dramatic

3587
01:47:52,471 --> 01:47:53,070
results.

3588
01:47:53,070 --> 01:47:53,461
And yet,

3589
01:47:53,461 --> 01:47:54,300
as you say,

3590
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:56,910
it's still considered fringe.

3591
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:01,320
Although relating back to our earlier
conversation about institutions being in

3592
01:48:01,321 --> 01:48:02,430
the state of crisis,

3593
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:07,590
because people sort of recognize the
false values and these institutions,

3594
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:09,980
the government finally
allowing researchers.

3595
01:48:09,981 --> 01:48:10,630
Yeah,

3596
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:11,463
yeah.

3597
01:48:11,900 --> 01:48:13,820
It's a pretty radical findings.

3598
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:14,280
Uh,

3599
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:17,620
the John Hopkins Study on
Psilocybin and behavioral change,

3600
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:22,870
how it just one trip affected people's
behavior and personality is positively 20

3601
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:23,450
years later.

3602
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:23,750
And,

3603
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:28,190
and what Hancock was talking about
with specifically the effect of some

3604
01:48:28,191 --> 01:48:30,170
hallucinogens on addiction.

3605
01:48:30,340 --> 01:48:30,760
Yes.

3606
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:33,340
And he was using his own
personal addiction to cannabis.

3607
01:48:33,341 --> 01:48:36,610
He had a lifelong history
of abuse as he called it,

3608
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,870
with cannabis.

3609
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:39,350
Say,

3610
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:40,181
sorry to interrupt you,

3611
01:48:40,181 --> 01:48:42,520
but just the last point on that I,

3612
01:48:42,521 --> 01:48:44,110
I didn't listen to sheldrake's thing,

3613
01:48:44,111 --> 01:48:49,060
but I did listen to Hancock and he
framed the whole thing in I think very

3614
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,170
scientific terms.

3615
01:48:50,171 --> 01:48:50,560
He said,

3616
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,190
this may have caused this
leap forward in consciousness.

3617
01:48:54,191 --> 01:48:56,890
This may have been
responsible for this and that

3618
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:00,400
it's absolutely a fascinating
possibility to consider.

3619
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:04,540
And the only people in my opinion
that would not consider it are again,

3620
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:09,430
people that have had no experiences with
it or people that were worried about

3621
01:49:09,431 --> 01:49:11,500
the mainstream academic approval.

3622
01:49:11,501 --> 01:49:13,060
And so they step back and go,

3623
01:49:13,061 --> 01:49:13,211
oh,

3624
01:49:13,211 --> 01:49:14,470
this is preposterous,

3625
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:15,760
you know,

3626
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:16,540
this is not,

3627
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:18,880
it's an incredibly powerful experience.

3628
01:49:18,881 --> 01:49:20,050
It cannot be denied.

3629
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:20,350
And,

3630
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:21,970
and yet for whatever reason,

3631
01:49:22,150 --> 01:49:25,030
we've lumped it into
silliness and I really,

3632
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,460
I struggled with now,

3633
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,221
or criminality.

3634
01:49:27,221 --> 01:49:27,461
Yes,

3635
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:28,750
even more scary than silliness.

3636
01:49:29,150 --> 01:49:29,760
Um,

3637
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:30,160
I've,

3638
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:30,320
uh,

3639
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,320
really it's really boggled my mind.

3640
01:49:32,321 --> 01:49:35,050
And the only thing that makes
sense is that it's ignorance.

3641
01:49:35,051 --> 01:49:36,790
It's the illegality of it,

3642
01:49:37,060 --> 01:49:40,810
which was a hoist onto the American
people in the 19 seventies when they were

3643
01:49:40,811 --> 01:49:45,700
just trying to control this mass
change in culture that had happened so

3644
01:49:45,701 --> 01:49:47,020
radically between the fifties,

3645
01:49:47,110 --> 01:49:47,943
the sixties.

3646
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,070
And we lost a lot of information in that.

3647
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,650
And we also got a lot of
people that were scared,

3648
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,180
scared about going to jail,

3649
01:49:55,181 --> 01:50:00,181
scared about losing their jobs and that
all that fear and ignorance clouds the

3650
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:01,330
actual argument.

3651
01:50:01,331 --> 01:50:06,040
It clouds the actual facts that
surround these weird substances.

3652
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:06,930
And they,

3653
01:50:06,930 --> 01:50:08,200
they're not the cure all.

3654
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:08,860
They're not,

3655
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:09,281
they're not,

3656
01:50:09,281 --> 01:50:10,600
they're not for everybody.

3657
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:13,960
But what they are is incredibly
powerful experiences.

3658
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:19,390
I think that can be denied and to deny
the impact of one of the most amazing

3659
01:50:20,170 --> 01:50:24,550
trends in dental experiences that a human
being can ever possibly experience and

3660
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:27,010
the fact that it's an orally active thing,

3661
01:50:27,011 --> 01:50:31,090
that it grows all over the place
where these people absolutely lived.

3662
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:34,240
To deny the connection seems really silly.

3663
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:34,711
It doesn't.

3664
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:35,544
It seems like you're.

3665
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:37,110
You're being a fool and you're.

3666
01:50:37,111 --> 01:50:38,390
You're ignoring information

3667
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,360
and people all over the world
who have access to these plants,

3668
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:42,890
wherever you find them,

3669
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,860
consider them to be the
greatest gift of the gods.

3670
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:46,460
Yes,

3671
01:50:46,460 --> 01:50:49,160
and then you've got our culture that says,

3672
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:52,460
if you get caught with
an ounce of Siliciden,

3673
01:50:52,461 --> 01:50:55,250
mushrooms are 100 hits of
acid at a grateful dead show.

3674
01:50:55,251 --> 01:50:59,630
You go to prison under minimum mandatory
sentencing for longer than second

3675
01:50:59,631 --> 01:51:00,261
degree murder.

3676
01:51:00,261 --> 01:51:00,740
Yeah.

3677
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:01,910
What the fuck is that?

3678
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:05,580
That's complete pure insanity
that that's insanity,

3679
01:51:05,581 --> 01:51:10,581
but what's even more and sanity is to me
that people in positions of prominence

3680
01:51:11,101 --> 01:51:16,101
academically who will talk on these
subjects have not had this experience and

3681
01:51:17,071 --> 01:51:17,821
I'm like my God,

3682
01:51:17,821 --> 01:51:18,630
your children,

3683
01:51:18,630 --> 01:51:20,550
and it sounds so arrogant to say that,

3684
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:25,690
but someone who's like talking about the
negative effects of psychedelic drugs

3685
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:29,550
that hasn't had psychedelic drugs will
feel like a child after he has a mushroom

3686
01:51:29,551 --> 01:51:29,980
chip.

3687
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:31,050
He will feel like a full.

3688
01:51:31,170 --> 01:51:35,880
You will feel like you the dumbest person
in the world to have ignored that and

3689
01:51:35,881 --> 01:51:38,790
Pooh poohed that takes
six grams of mushrooms,

3690
01:51:38,791 --> 01:51:43,170
get in an isolation tank and tell me
you don't have some regrets for how you

3691
01:51:43,171 --> 01:51:44,370
look at that shit before.

3692
01:51:44,580 --> 01:51:45,410
Right?

3693
01:51:45,410 --> 01:51:46,990
They're not having it and it's these.

3694
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:49,800
These are the same people that
are pulling these things down.

3695
01:51:49,801 --> 01:51:53,700
I guarantee you the people that have
had profound mushroom trips are not

3696
01:51:53,701 --> 01:51:54,331
interested in,

3697
01:51:54,331 --> 01:51:54,870
in,

3698
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:59,250
in silencing this Graham
Hancock a war on consciousness,

3699
01:51:59,251 --> 01:52:01,470
which originally was called beating.

3700
01:52:01,470 --> 01:52:03,060
I think something about the green bitch.

3701
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:05,010
He reasonably could
defeating the Green Bitch,

3702
01:52:05,011 --> 01:52:06,080
which was his addiction,

3703
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:07,800
cannabis and how the.

3704
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:08,280
The,

3705
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:11,700
the IOWASCA helped him see who he was,

3706
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:12,400
his,

3707
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:12,670
his,

3708
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:12,790
uh,

3709
01:52:12,790 --> 01:52:16,710
abusive relationship and it seems really
fascinating guy because he's not down

3710
01:52:16,711 --> 01:52:18,210
on marijuana at all.

3711
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:23,250
He's sort of attributes it to his own
abuse of it and using it as a crutch

3712
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,800
instead of using it to enhance,

3713
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:26,251
you know,

3714
01:52:26,251 --> 01:52:29,520
so he had whatever
addictive issues he had.

3715
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,140
That's how they mean that.

3716
01:52:31,141 --> 01:52:32,580
And that is a real issue with addiction,

3717
01:52:32,581 --> 01:52:32,821
right?

3718
01:52:32,821 --> 01:52:33,090
It's like,

3719
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:37,650
it's not necessarily the substance of the
biologic triggers what's going on with

3720
01:52:37,651 --> 01:52:39,870
you that makes you obsess
with scratch tickets.

3721
01:52:39,950 --> 01:52:40,220
Who's

3722
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:40,791
The guy?

3723
01:52:40,791 --> 01:52:43,790
I'm the British actors,

3724
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:44,690
Guinea comedian.

3725
01:52:44,691 --> 01:52:46,460
Really Guy Sleeping with Russell brand,

3726
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:47,181
Russell brand.

3727
01:52:47,181 --> 01:52:48,014
Thank you.

3728
01:52:48,770 --> 01:52:49,603
Should play.

3729
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,530
This is what happens when
we get all that back.

3730
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:54,710
I remember the Guy
fucking point me my brain,

3731
01:52:54,711 --> 01:52:58,280
I'll just stick in the air
massage guy likes massages.

3732
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,990
Russell brand wrote a thing recently
about addiction and he said something I

3733
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:03,890
thought was really wise.

3734
01:53:03,891 --> 01:53:06,710
He said drugs weren't my problem,

3735
01:53:06,711 --> 01:53:08,960
drugs were my answer to my problem.

3736
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,120
Uh,

3737
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,520
and it's,

3738
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:11,990
it's exactly what you just said in that.

3739
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:13,460
I agree completely.

3740
01:53:13,490 --> 01:53:15,890
Drugs aren't causing the addiction.

3741
01:53:15,891 --> 01:53:17,240
You've got an addiction,

3742
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:19,460
it can manifest as you know,

3743
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:20,221
in marijuana,

3744
01:53:20,221 --> 01:53:22,880
in gambling and jerking off and you know,

3745
01:53:22,890 --> 01:53:27,890
a million different ways and if you
locate the problem in the substance then

3746
01:53:28,191 --> 01:53:30,510
you'll never solve the problem
because that's just a symptom,

3747
01:53:30,511 --> 01:53:30,620
right?

3748
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,350
There is a physiological issue
that goes along with that as well.

3749
01:53:33,351 --> 01:53:35,450
So because there's two
types of situations,

3750
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:39,260
there's the gambling situation where
you're sort of getting addicted to the

3751
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:40,094
response,

3752
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,510
but then there's a real like,

3753
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,800
like an oxycontin thing.

3754
01:53:42,830 --> 01:53:47,300
Like I have a friend who had
a back operation and then
after his back operation

3755
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:51,680
they throw them on some oxygen and
he was fucked up for a long time.

3756
01:53:51,681 --> 01:53:55,700
He started getting prescriptions from
more than one different doctor and he was

3757
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:56,534
a mess.

3758
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,433
He just went,

3759
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:01,910
I just went crazy spiral
and it was absolutely a
physiological addiction because

3760
01:54:01,911 --> 01:54:06,450
before that he really didn't exhibit
crazy addictive or impulsive behaviors and

3761
01:54:06,451 --> 01:54:07,780
they were manifested itself with these.

3762
01:54:07,781 --> 01:54:08,614
But it's situation

3763
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:13,620
changed with that pain and the gambler
is also getting a chemical a high.

3764
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:15,660
Yes,

3765
01:54:15,660 --> 01:54:15,980
you know,

3766
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:19,000
the brain is releasing
endorphins or whatever it is.

3767
01:54:19,001 --> 01:54:19,870
And in that case,

3768
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:20,710
so there,

3769
01:54:20,710 --> 01:54:20,951
you know,

3770
01:54:20,951 --> 01:54:23,890
you could argue they're both
physiological on some level,

3771
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:24,761
but yeah,

3772
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:26,320
the point is that there is some,

3773
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:28,060
in his case it was chronic pain.

3774
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:31,510
In another case it could be ptsd,

3775
01:54:31,511 --> 01:54:33,490
it could be a fucked up childhood,

3776
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:34,390
it could be whatever.

3777
01:54:34,490 --> 01:54:36,600
That is a funny way to look
at it that I never think I,

3778
01:54:36,601 --> 01:54:39,710
I don't think I ever looked at it that
way before that it is still a chemical

3779
01:54:39,711 --> 01:54:40,191
addiction.

3780
01:54:40,191 --> 01:54:41,750
It's just sort of an endogenous one.

3781
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,290
Yeah.

3782
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:42,800
Yeah.

3783
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:43,461
That's funny.

3784
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:44,660
I never thought about it that way.

3785
01:54:44,661 --> 01:54:45,980
I was knocked it off

3786
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:47,150
thing.

3787
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:47,630
Yeah.

3788
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:47,841
I mean,

3789
01:54:47,841 --> 01:54:50,780
orgasm as people jerk off in
front of the computer all day.

3790
01:54:50,781 --> 01:54:52,610
They're get there some
we're talking to you.

3791
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:53,211
Yeah.

3792
01:54:53,211 --> 01:54:53,690
That's you.

3793
01:54:53,690 --> 01:54:54,071
That's you,

3794
01:54:54,071 --> 01:54:54,741
you motherfucker.

3795
01:54:54,741 --> 01:54:55,574
You know you are.

3796
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,120
Yeah.

3797
01:54:59,120 --> 01:54:59,421
Yeah.

3798
01:54:59,421 --> 01:54:59,750
That's.

3799
01:54:59,750 --> 01:55:03,850
Well that's also sort of just
becomes like impulsive it,

3800
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:06,260
like it was not even a
reward sometimes it just,

3801
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:07,970
just sort of repeat a pattern.

3802
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:08,780
Like you're stuck.

3803
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:10,610
You got to scratch her when you stop.

3804
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:12,320
And that's what addiction is.

3805
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:13,423
It hurts when you stopped.

3806
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,780
You were talking earlier,

3807
01:55:14,781 --> 01:55:18,440
we were talking about primitive so
called primitive societies and stuff.

3808
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:23,441
You reminded me of this amazing story I
read recently where this BBC team went

3809
01:55:23,841 --> 01:55:28,841
into Papa New Guinea way back some river
and they were doing a special on these

3810
01:55:29,211 --> 01:55:31,550
very so called primitive
people back there,

3811
01:55:31,551 --> 01:55:31,821
you know,

3812
01:55:31,821 --> 01:55:32,451
no Internet,

3813
01:55:32,451 --> 01:55:33,284
no nothing.

3814
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,450
And one of the guys,

3815
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:35,900
uh,

3816
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,370
after they'd finished filming,

3817
01:55:37,371 --> 01:55:38,151
one of the guys said,

3818
01:55:38,151 --> 01:55:38,301
well,

3819
01:55:38,301 --> 01:55:38,690
you've,

3820
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:39,950
we've shown you our world.

3821
01:55:39,980 --> 01:55:41,900
Why don't you bring me to your world?

3822
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:43,010
I'd like to see your world.

3823
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:44,220
So when he was back

3824
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:44,881
in London,

3825
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:47,520
he talked to some people and they said,

3826
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:47,761
well,

3827
01:55:47,761 --> 01:55:48,001
okay,

3828
01:55:48,001 --> 01:55:48,690
we'll fund it.

3829
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:50,070
That would be an interesting thing.

3830
01:55:50,071 --> 01:55:51,720
Bring these guys into London and you know,

3831
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:53,430
and do this whole thing
sort of in reverse.

3832
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:54,890
What's that?

3833
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:55,723
It's a sitcom.

3834
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,460
Yeah,

3835
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,190
exactly.

3836
01:55:57,190 --> 01:55:57,820
Realities.

3837
01:55:57,820 --> 01:55:59,820
Dude's fucking reality shifts.

3838
01:55:59,821 --> 01:56:00,570
Take them in London.

3839
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:01,050
Yeah.

3840
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:03,810
So the Jersey shore for the UK.

3841
01:56:05,860 --> 01:56:06,693
So,

3842
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:07,800
so this guy,

3843
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:12,360
his concern was that once
this guy saw the modern world,

3844
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:13,560
he would never want to go home.

3845
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,350
So he called up an
anthropologist and he said,

3846
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:16,561
look,

3847
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:17,550
I'm really worried about this.

3848
01:56:17,551 --> 01:56:18,420
I'd like to do this,

3849
01:56:18,421 --> 01:56:18,940
but.

3850
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,990
And the anthropologists
send you arrogant asshole.

3851
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:26,250
You really think this guy's going to be
so impressed by London that he'd never

3852
01:56:26,251 --> 01:56:28,820
want to go back to his friends
and family and you know,

3853
01:56:28,860 --> 01:56:30,810
his whole world and all
that just calm down.

3854
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:31,680
That's not going to happen.

3855
01:56:31,680 --> 01:56:31,921
Right?

3856
01:56:31,921 --> 01:56:32,610
Trust.

3857
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:34,230
So they fly this guy,

3858
01:56:34,231 --> 01:56:37,620
if you guys up to London or
they take them all around,

3859
01:56:37,621 --> 01:56:38,071
show them,

3860
01:56:38,071 --> 01:56:38,311
you know,

3861
01:56:38,311 --> 01:56:38,851
whatever,

3862
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:39,684
all these different things.

3863
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:44,490
And one of the things they really
wanted to see was something like a,

3864
01:56:44,730 --> 01:56:46,290
an archery range.

3865
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:50,550
So they took them to this archery range
and they were so fascinated by the

3866
01:56:50,551 --> 01:56:54,270
arrows that had feathers on
the era of the flushings.

3867
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:54,691
Yeah.

3868
01:56:54,691 --> 01:56:56,600
Their feathers didn't have arrows.

3869
01:56:57,080 --> 01:56:57,950
Arrows in the federal.

3870
01:56:57,960 --> 01:56:58,360
Sorry,

3871
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:59,550
there's didn't have feathers.

3872
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:00,661
So anyway,

3873
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:02,730
at the end of this whole
experience of being in London,

3874
01:57:02,731 --> 01:57:07,110
the only thing they wanted to take back
was this knowledge of how you put the

3875
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:08,101
feathers on the air.

3876
01:57:08,101 --> 01:57:08,934
They weren't interested in.

3877
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,171
No.

3878
01:57:09,171 --> 01:57:09,630
At the worlds.

3879
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:11,850
That story is that London ain't Tahiti,

3880
01:57:18,250 --> 01:57:18,900
Tahiti,

3881
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:19,621
anthropologists,

3882
01:57:19,621 --> 01:57:20,071
and be like,

3883
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:20,611
yeah,

3884
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:21,444
they're not going

3885
01:57:24,430 --> 01:57:25,280
to get him on his shit.

3886
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:28,160
Drunk white leg paper
eating fish and chips.

3887
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:28,440
They're gonna.

3888
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:30,360
Want to get the fuck out of there
as quickly as they got their

3889
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:33,271
new kitties.

3890
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:33,691
That trip,

3891
01:57:33,691 --> 01:57:34,524
man,

3892
01:57:34,550 --> 01:57:36,940
[inaudible] New Guinea
has those semen warriors.

3893
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:41,040
That's one of the weirdest and I was going
to bring that up earlier when we were

3894
01:57:41,041 --> 01:57:46,041
talking about these patterns that sort
of develop in these tribal societies.

3895
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:50,040
One of the most bizarre ones is these,

3896
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:55,830
they take young boys away from their
mother when they're like six or seven and

3897
01:57:56,041 --> 01:58:01,041
they live with men that are the like an
anal father and anal son like that's how

3898
01:58:01,441 --> 01:58:01,670
they.

3899
01:58:01,670 --> 01:58:02,170
They they,

3900
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:07,170
they call it and the man just
fucks these kids and they.

3901
01:58:07,631 --> 01:58:12,360
They believe that the kid has to swallow
and ingest semen into his body in order

3902
01:58:12,361 --> 01:58:16,320
for him to grow up strong and be a
man and that they only use women for,

3903
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:21,800
for procreation or that this entire
culture of thousands of people is wrapped

3904
01:58:23,191 --> 01:58:24,600
around little kids,

3905
01:58:24,601 --> 01:58:27,690
sucking guys dicks to
grow old to grow strong.

3906
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:28,800
Fucking.

3907
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,633
That is.

3908
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:33,820
That is one of the craziest ones I've
ever written or read rather than.

3909
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,110
Yeah,

3910
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:37,620
that somehow or another they
convinced thousands of people

3911
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,111
into that one.

3912
01:58:40,111 --> 01:58:41,770
But what's the of that?

3913
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:42,100
Oh,

3914
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,660
who knows?

3915
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:43,010
You know,

3916
01:58:43,010 --> 01:58:44,020
they don't want nobody to know,

3917
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:46,720
but you find stuff like that motherfucker.

3918
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:47,963
Just

3919
01:58:49,220 --> 01:58:52,250
one pope can just ruin
a whole damn religion.

3920
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,980
Maybe they were missionaries because
you know that happened in the Amazon.

3921
01:58:56,981 --> 01:58:59,920
There's a case of Liza was his name.

3922
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:01,030
He's a French missionary.

3923
01:59:01,031 --> 01:59:01,864
He was the,

3924
01:59:02,170 --> 01:59:03,130
or an anthropologist.

3925
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:07,510
He wasn't a missionary is an
anthropologist who studied under a,

3926
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:08,470
the great French,

3927
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,820
a Levy Strauss,

3928
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:15,240
and he went to the Yanomami people in
Venezuela and he was fucking all the boys

3929
01:59:17,291 --> 01:59:20,620
and doing all this crazy shit and telling
them that this was the way it worked

3930
01:59:20,621 --> 01:59:21,191
in the world.

3931
01:59:21,191 --> 01:59:22,024
And you know,

3932
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:22,871
he's still there.

3933
01:59:22,871 --> 01:59:24,010
I think he's still alive.

3934
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:27,310
This part of the whole holy
and Shag non situation.

3935
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:28,630
I don't know if you're familiar with that.

3936
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:29,921
Yeah.

3937
01:59:29,921 --> 01:59:32,800
It's very controversial
stuff that happened.

3938
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:33,250
Uh,

3939
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,150
Shannon is,

3940
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,740
he wrote the fierce people,

3941
01:59:35,741 --> 01:59:38,380
which is the best selling
anthropology book of all time.

3942
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:41,770
And he was like a Hemingway Kinda guy.

3943
01:59:41,771 --> 01:59:46,090
And he just published a book recently
talking about trying to redeem his

3944
01:59:46,091 --> 01:59:50,500
reputation because it turns out like
what he did was he went to the Amazon in

3945
01:59:50,501 --> 01:59:51,790
the late sixties,

3946
01:59:52,390 --> 01:59:53,020
uh,

3947
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,310
or the Orinoco really,

3948
01:59:54,311 --> 01:59:56,950
which is a tributary of
the Amazon in Venezuela.

3949
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:01,590
And he was studying the
Yanomami people and um,

3950
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:07,740
he wrote a thesis and calling them
the fierce people saying that they,

3951
02:00:07,971 --> 02:00:10,540
they killed each other at such high rates.

3952
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:15,280
And this justifies this hobbsy and view
of the origins of human violence that

3953
02:00:15,281 --> 02:00:19,930
were really nasty and so we need these
governments and religions to keep us in

3954
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:20,591
check and you know,

3955
02:00:20,591 --> 02:00:21,580
it's very political,

3956
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:21,851
right?

3957
02:00:21,851 --> 02:00:23,530
But he was just saying it's anthropology,

3958
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:28,450
but it resonated with the culture of
Vietnam was happening and there's all this

3959
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:30,640
discussion of what,

3960
02:00:30,700 --> 02:00:32,050
why are we violent?

3961
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:33,040
Is that our nature?

3962
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:34,660
Or is it institutional,

3963
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:35,201
you know,

3964
02:00:35,201 --> 02:00:37,750
the whole hippies versus
the institution debate.

3965
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:38,561
So anyway,

3966
02:00:38,561 --> 02:00:42,700
he wrote this book and it was a huge
bestseller and he became super famous.

3967
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:47,020
Turns out that when he
went into this area,

3968
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:52,080
he brought lots of machetes and these
people didn't have lots of machetes.

3969
02:00:52,241 --> 02:00:54,310
They didn't have metal tools at all.

3970
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:58,570
So he brings in the machetes and he starts
giving the machetes to certain groups

3971
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,820
in exchange for their cooperation.

3972
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:05,080
And his research was on a genealogy,

3973
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:07,570
so he needed to get
the names of ancestors.

3974
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:09,520
But it turns out that the Yanomami,

3975
02:01:09,521 --> 02:01:12,370
it's a great taboo to ever
say the name of a dead person.

3976
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,140
So what he would do is say,

3977
02:01:14,141 --> 02:01:14,650
okay,

3978
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:18,460
I'll give you this machete if you
tell me the names of the father and

3979
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:22,180
grandfather have that guy
from that other village,

3980
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:26,290
so he would bribe them
to get this information,

3981
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:29,710
but that's a great taboo to say the names
of that guy's father or grandfather,

3982
02:01:29,711 --> 02:01:30,430
right.

3983
02:01:30,430 --> 02:01:34,270
So then he would go to the other village
and as a way to confirm whether the

3984
02:01:34,271 --> 02:01:35,680
information was correct,

3985
02:01:35,740 --> 02:01:39,950
he would say so and so over there said
your father and grandfather were blah

3986
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:41,060
blah blah and blah blah blah.

3987
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:42,440
And if they got really pissed off,

3988
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:43,610
he knew it was correct.

3989
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:45,800
So that would confirm his information.

3990
02:01:46,460 --> 02:01:47,750
Then they would break,

3991
02:01:47,810 --> 02:01:50,990
they would have all these wars and they
kill each other with these machetes.

3992
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:52,550
And then he reported back saying,

3993
02:01:52,551 --> 02:01:52,701
Oh,

3994
02:01:52,701 --> 02:01:57,701
the Yanomami are very fierce destructive
war like people and this is the origins

3995
02:01:57,861 --> 02:01:59,210
of humanity and Yada Yada.

3996
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:01,040
Ya fucking bullshit,

3997
02:02:01,041 --> 02:02:01,790
man.

3998
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:02,630
Complete Bullshit.

3999
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:03,590
That's amazing.

4000
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:03,920
Yeah.

4001
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:08,330
So there is a book called darkness and
El Dorado that came out a few years ago.

4002
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,750
It was a big bestseller and
exposed a lot of this stuff.

4003
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:15,500
And it also went further
and accused him of genocide,

4004
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:16,370
him and this other guy,

4005
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:17,204
neal,

4006
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:22,630
for it accused them of using a vaccination
program as a way to sort of test

4007
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:25,550
immune responses.

4008
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:28,070
And that appears to be for.

4009
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:29,780
That appears to have been true.

4010
02:02:29,860 --> 02:02:30,200
Right.

4011
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:33,620
But the other stuff with the machetes
and sewing violence and all that,

4012
02:02:33,621 --> 02:02:36,430
and then reporting that their
station from the other guy.

4013
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:37,453
The other guy.

4014
02:02:37,530 --> 02:02:37,990
Yeah.

4015
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:38,270
Yeah.

4016
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:38,840
That's true.

4017
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:43,280
About fucking group of victimized people
trying to just get along and these

4018
02:02:43,281 --> 02:02:45,230
white people come along
and fuck everything up.

4019
02:02:45,430 --> 02:02:46,030
Yeah.

4020
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:46,370
Yeah.

4021
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:47,190
And they even.

4022
02:02:47,190 --> 02:02:48,380
I write about the insects,

4023
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:50,240
the situation in sex at dawn and they,

4024
02:02:50,241 --> 02:02:52,660
even the Yanomami have
a special word called,

4025
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:53,900
I think it's anthro,

4026
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:57,740
which means like a crazy
destructive white person.

4027
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:02,420
And so he's not even allowed
to go back to Venezuela.

4028
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,920
He's barred from the country.

4029
02:03:04,010 --> 02:03:04,810
Wow.

4030
02:03:04,810 --> 02:03:05,320
Yeah.

4031
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:05,720
Yeah.

4032
02:03:05,720 --> 02:03:07,520
I don't know why I was talking about that.

4033
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:08,800
I don't remember what 10.

4034
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:09,561
Doesn't matter.

4035
02:03:09,561 --> 02:03:09,741
It's,

4036
02:03:09,741 --> 02:03:10,011
it's,

4037
02:03:10,011 --> 02:03:10,081
uh,

4038
02:03:10,081 --> 02:03:10,490
it's.

4039
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:10,791
Well,

4040
02:03:10,791 --> 02:03:13,490
it's just the distortion of the,

4041
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:13,710
our,

4042
02:03:13,710 --> 02:03:16,550
our image of these people and how
these crazy cultures can interrupt.

4043
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:20,850
That might've been missionaries that cause
these guys to blow all these kids and

4044
02:03:20,860 --> 02:03:21,380
by the time,

4045
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:21,651
oh,

4046
02:03:21,651 --> 02:03:23,680
that's what I was rather.

4047
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:24,471
I mean,

4048
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:29,210
you see these interesting sexual
practices all over the world and so they,

4049
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:30,530
a lot of stuffs,

4050
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:31,341
you know that.

4051
02:03:31,341 --> 02:03:34,670
When I was talking about that when last
night at a cocktail party in Venice

4052
02:03:34,671 --> 02:03:37,520
actually I was talking with this gay
guy and we were talking about how,

4053
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:38,050
you know,

4054
02:03:38,050 --> 02:03:40,100
we think we know what it means to be gay,

4055
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:42,830
but you look at a culture
like that and you say,

4056
02:03:42,831 --> 02:03:43,011
well,

4057
02:03:43,011 --> 02:03:43,844
are they gay?

4058
02:03:44,170 --> 02:03:47,840
I know they consider it to
be normal sexual development,

4059
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:48,890
conventional,

4060
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:49,341
you know,

4061
02:03:49,341 --> 02:03:49,941
that's what you do.

4062
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:50,774
Or the Messiah,

4063
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:51,381
the Messiah,

4064
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:51,651
you know,

4065
02:03:51,651 --> 02:03:55,370
the herb's herdsmen new drink
blood and milk in Kenya.

4066
02:03:55,910 --> 02:03:58,700
They have a similar sort
of thing where the young,

4067
02:03:58,730 --> 02:04:00,980
younger boys go out on these long,

4068
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:02,301
you know,

4069
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:05,270
when they're out with the herds
for weeks or months at a time.

4070
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:09,080
They go out with the older boys and
the older boys will have sex with them.

4071
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:10,100
Not Anal sex,

4072
02:04:10,101 --> 02:04:11,690
but they'll um,

4073
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:15,530
they'll put their penis between
the thighs of the younger boy.

4074
02:04:15,650 --> 02:04:16,720
That was how the room is that?

4075
02:04:17,360 --> 02:04:17,630
Yeah,

4076
02:04:17,630 --> 02:04:18,470
there's a name for that.

4077
02:04:18,471 --> 02:04:20,360
I can't remember the word
was specific word for it.

4078
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:20,781
Either way.

4079
02:04:20,781 --> 02:04:21,614
It's still good.

4080
02:04:21,950 --> 02:04:22,430
Let them know.

4081
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:23,263
Well,

4082
02:04:24,350 --> 02:04:24,921
that's the thing.

4083
02:04:24,921 --> 02:04:26,930
They would say it's not
because then they get older.

4084
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:27,651
They marry a woman.

4085
02:04:27,651 --> 02:04:28,340
They have kids.

4086
02:04:28,340 --> 02:04:30,530
That's just normal growing up.

4087
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,640
Normal fuckery.

4088
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:32,790
Yeah.

4089
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:34,000
I'm not.

4090
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:38,190
I think once you know what
kind of a effect that has

4091
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:39,240
on the young boys,

4092
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:40,771
that's the thing.

4093
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:42,060
If it's considered normal,

4094
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:44,180
it doesn't knock it until you fight it.

4095
02:04:44,870 --> 02:04:45,340
Oh,

4096
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:46,173
how dare you.

4097
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:47,933
How dare you.

4098
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:49,460
He was so proud of himself.

4099
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:52,560
He was hanging out with
Hinchcliffe too long.

4100
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:53,311
The,

4101
02:04:53,311 --> 02:04:54,144
um,

4102
02:04:54,350 --> 02:04:54,720
the,

4103
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:58,230
the idea though that it's not going to
have an effect is only based on the fact

4104
02:04:58,231 --> 02:05:00,510
that they're going to do it to more
young boys and they're not going to

4105
02:05:00,511 --> 02:05:01,344
complain.

4106
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:01,801
And that's,

4107
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:02,190
uh,

4108
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:07,190
one of the weird things about sexual
abuse is that it sort of re re manifests

4109
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:12,140
itself in the victim and
they start to be become a,

4110
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,283
they become

4111
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:14,290
the,

4112
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,040
the accuser.

4113
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:15,230
I mean,

4114
02:05:15,230 --> 02:05:15,311
they,

4115
02:05:15,311 --> 02:05:16,750
they also become the perpetrator.

4116
02:05:16,751 --> 02:05:17,270
They,

4117
02:05:17,270 --> 02:05:18,220
in fact that,

4118
02:05:18,221 --> 02:05:21,110
that a guy I was speaking to recently

4119
02:05:22,610 --> 02:05:24,170
who identifies as gay,

4120
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,160
he said to me,

4121
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:27,020
I don't think I was born gay.

4122
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:31,280
I think I'm gay because I was sexually
abused as a child by my stepfather from

4123
02:05:31,281 --> 02:05:32,420
the time I was three.

4124
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:36,170
And we got into this
whole discussion of how,

4125
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:37,000
um,

4126
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:37,360
it's,

4127
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:41,930
there's the term erotic plasticity and
how different it is for men and women in

4128
02:05:41,931 --> 02:05:43,790
men and males have other mammals.

4129
02:05:44,090 --> 02:05:49,090
There seems to be a developmental window
where we imprint something and that

4130
02:05:52,401 --> 02:05:56,150
window closes and if you got an
imprint that sticks with you for life,

4131
02:05:56,151 --> 02:05:58,970
which is why virtually
all fetishist sermon,

4132
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,080
right?

4133
02:06:00,080 --> 02:06:01,430
There are a lot of men who will say,

4134
02:06:01,431 --> 02:06:01,641
well,

4135
02:06:01,641 --> 02:06:03,350
I can't get off unless you know,

4136
02:06:03,351 --> 02:06:06,080
there's latex or she's
wearing red high heeled shoes,

4137
02:06:06,081 --> 02:06:07,100
or she's got this or that.

4138
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:07,700
Right?

4139
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,091
You don't.

4140
02:06:08,091 --> 02:06:09,860
Women don't say that like women,

4141
02:06:09,890 --> 02:06:10,131
you know,

4142
02:06:10,131 --> 02:06:13,010
they're much more flexible
and adapt to the situation.

4143
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:18,580
So the idea is that if during that
window you're imprinted with male,

4144
02:06:18,891 --> 02:06:21,500
male sex and pleasure involved with that,

4145
02:06:22,040 --> 02:06:27,040
then you could sort of like have that
as a fetish even though you were born,

4146
02:06:29,361 --> 02:06:29,601
you know,

4147
02:06:29,601 --> 02:06:32,870
you're sort of genetic components or
your brain development or whatever.

4148
02:06:32,871 --> 02:06:35,150
There are different
theories is heterosexual.

4149
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:36,650
So there are different.

4150
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,300
According to this idea,

4151
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:40,730
there are different ways to be gay.

4152
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:42,770
You can be born gay or you could be,

4153
02:06:43,130 --> 02:06:45,680
you could be gay as a fetish in a way,

4154
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,520
you know,

4155
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:47,001
but anyway,

4156
02:06:47,001 --> 02:06:48,860
related to what you were
saying about the trauma,

4157
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:54,310
there's research showing that what
really causes the trauma is the shame

4158
02:06:55,881 --> 02:07:00,881
generated by the culture that boys who
are what we would call sexually abused or

4159
02:07:01,851 --> 02:07:04,610
girls who were sexually
abused at a young age.

4160
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:05,570
Uh,

4161
02:07:05,570 --> 02:07:07,340
if there's not pain involved,

4162
02:07:07,341 --> 02:07:07,581
right?

4163
02:07:07,581 --> 02:07:10,040
If it's inappropriate
touching or whatever,

4164
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:11,303
um,

4165
02:07:11,510 --> 02:07:16,070
the trauma comes about when they're told
that was really bad and they're told

4166
02:07:16,071 --> 02:07:17,690
that that's a horrible
thing that happened.

4167
02:07:18,170 --> 02:07:21,950
It doesn't necessarily come
about from the experience itself.

4168
02:07:21,951 --> 02:07:24,260
And I don't mean this as
to justify anything or

4169
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:27,990
aren't there a variety of
different types of experiences?

4170
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:33,110
Are these consensual and just innocent
or are these actual hold you down?

4171
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:34,290
Rape.

4172
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:35,123
That's what I'm saying.

4173
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:35,980
It's physical

4174
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,340
pains,

4175
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,173
a whole different thing.

4176
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:40,150
If it's just two little
kids diddling each other,

4177
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:41,440
you know,

4178
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:43,540
some mothers would say that's abuse.

4179
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:44,321
That's a horrible,

4180
02:07:44,321 --> 02:07:44,861
oh my God,

4181
02:07:44,861 --> 02:07:45,371
what happened?

4182
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:46,660
The best thing to do is just say,

4183
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:46,901
hey,

4184
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:47,650
nothing happened.

4185
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:47,981
You know,

4186
02:07:47,981 --> 02:07:48,970
it's no big deal.

4187
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:49,890
Right?

4188
02:07:49,890 --> 02:07:50,650
Um,

4189
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:55,650
and there are psychological studies
showing that the lasting effects are

4190
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:57,760
negligible and less.

4191
02:07:58,030 --> 02:07:59,470
It's framed as,

4192
02:07:59,471 --> 02:08:00,251
oh my God,

4193
02:08:00,251 --> 02:08:00,920
what happened?

4194
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:02,050
That completely makes sense.

4195
02:08:02,160 --> 02:08:04,030
As does the framing thing,

4196
02:08:04,031 --> 02:08:06,100
the framing thing completely
makes sense as well,

4197
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:10,780
that there's something happens in their
life and they just get imprinted and

4198
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,180
that's been otherwise,

4199
02:08:13,300 --> 02:08:18,300
why would so many abuse victims
become abusers themselves?

4200
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:20,640
You would think that like you,

4201
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:24,040
the last thing you
would do is repeat that,

4202
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,460
right?

4203
02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:24,941
Oh my God,

4204
02:08:24,941 --> 02:08:27,170
that's the thing that fucked
you up and ruined you.

4205
02:08:27,180 --> 02:08:27,820
You would say like,

4206
02:08:27,820 --> 02:08:28,091
man,

4207
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:31,540
I would never want to do this to another
person and that would be how would we

4208
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:32,200
would evolve.

4209
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:36,070
So it seems like there's like a hitch
in the developmental process that allows

4210
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:40,000
weird things just to be accepted
and become the standard,

4211
02:08:40,001 --> 02:08:40,450
right?

4212
02:08:40,450 --> 02:08:45,450
They become eroticized and associated
with pleasure and so you try to relive

4213
02:08:46,361 --> 02:08:47,230
them later.

4214
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,290
There's a great experiment with,

4215
02:08:49,310 --> 02:08:50,080
um,

4216
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:53,710
it happened in Scotland I think
where they took a one year,

4217
02:08:53,711 --> 02:08:57,430
they had like a herd of goats and a
herd of sheep and so they took all the

4218
02:08:57,431 --> 02:08:58,330
babies,

4219
02:08:58,660 --> 02:09:02,470
all the baby goats and put them with the
sheep and they took all the baby sheep

4220
02:09:02,471 --> 02:09:03,580
and put them with the goats.

4221
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:07,300
So they were raised thinking
they were the other species,

4222
02:09:07,630 --> 02:09:08,350
right?

4223
02:09:08,350 --> 02:09:11,560
So all the goats grew up around the
sheep thinking I'm just a weird looking

4224
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:11,891
cheap.

4225
02:09:11,891 --> 02:09:12,161
Right.

4226
02:09:12,161 --> 02:09:13,390
And the vice versa.

4227
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:17,950
So the way till they got sexually mature
and started having sex and then they

4228
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:18,880
switched them back.

4229
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:24,600
And what happened was that the males
refused to have sex with their own species

4230
02:09:26,240 --> 02:09:29,770
because they had learned that none of
the male goats and learn like I fuck

4231
02:09:30,140 --> 02:09:30,973
sheep.

4232
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:31,570
No,

4233
02:09:31,570 --> 02:09:32,403
I fucked goats.

4234
02:09:32,560 --> 02:09:33,490
The females were like,

4235
02:09:33,491 --> 02:09:33,671
yeah,

4236
02:09:33,671 --> 02:09:34,504
whatever.

4237
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:35,171
You know,

4238
02:09:35,171 --> 02:09:36,850
they just sort of like went with it.

4239
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:38,470
But the males refused.

4240
02:09:38,471 --> 02:09:40,690
They were stuck with it
because they were imprinted.

4241
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,440
And that was it.

4242
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:42,670
That is fascinating.

4243
02:09:42,671 --> 02:09:43,180
Yeah.

4244
02:09:43,180 --> 02:09:43,870
What the fuck,

4245
02:09:43,870 --> 02:09:45,640
evolutionary purposes that play.

4246
02:09:45,960 --> 02:09:46,541
Who knows?

4247
02:09:46,541 --> 02:09:47,440
That's a good question.

4248
02:09:48,010 --> 02:09:48,491
I don't know,

4249
02:09:48,491 --> 02:09:48,820
but it's,

4250
02:09:48,820 --> 02:09:51,850
it's a common mistake I would say in,

4251
02:09:51,930 --> 02:09:56,020
and I'm not saying just among people
reading books for the first time among

4252
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,011
experts,

4253
02:09:57,011 --> 02:10:01,230
there's a mistake of thinking that
everything has an evolutionary function.

4254
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:03,490
I say sometimes it could just be the,

4255
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:06,140
the tide went that way
and that's what happened.

4256
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:07,030
And there's a,

4257
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:08,830
there's something Stephen Jay Gould,

4258
02:10:08,831 --> 02:10:11,440
the great evolutionary
theorist called spandrels,

4259
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:15,880
which are things that look
like they have a function,

4260
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:18,940
but they're actually sort of a
side effect of something else.

4261
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,171
You know,

4262
02:10:20,171 --> 02:10:21,190
like the chin,

4263
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:21,581
you know,

4264
02:10:21,581 --> 02:10:23,350
why did the Chin evolved the way it did?

4265
02:10:23,530 --> 02:10:24,280
Well,

4266
02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:26,500
we have a word for this
thing we call the chin,

4267
02:10:26,530 --> 02:10:28,060
but it's not actually a thing.

4268
02:10:28,061 --> 02:10:29,950
It's where the two jawbones fuse,

4269
02:10:30,370 --> 02:10:31,280
so it's,

4270
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:32,050
it does,

4271
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:32,351
you know,

4272
02:10:32,351 --> 02:10:34,180
it exists as linguistic concept,

4273
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:36,730
but not necessarily as
a biological concept.

4274
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:38,010
So they're,

4275
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:39,100
they're weird,

4276
02:10:39,290 --> 02:10:40,123
you know,

4277
02:10:40,840 --> 02:10:41,890
they're murky waters.

4278
02:10:41,891 --> 02:10:45,040
You can get lost and when you're
looking at evolutionary stuff,

4279
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:48,160
and he always advised people.

4280
02:10:48,161 --> 02:10:48,971
You always say,

4281
02:10:48,971 --> 02:10:50,500
what's the evolutionary function of that?

4282
02:10:50,501 --> 02:10:55,270
Be Clear on what that is and that it
actually would necessarily have an

4283
02:10:55,271 --> 02:10:56,440
evolutionary function.

4284
02:10:56,560 --> 02:10:57,393
You know,

4285
02:10:57,740 --> 02:11:02,740
I've always been fascinated by why
at the same time all over the world,

4286
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:07,880
people who are human beings or you can
breed with each other but have such

4287
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:12,940
incredibly varied ways of behaving and
that this has always been this way.

4288
02:11:13,780 --> 02:11:14,780
I'm really into this.

4289
02:11:14,781 --> 02:11:16,160
I'm Dan Carlin,

4290
02:11:16,180 --> 02:11:17,510
a podcast recently.

4291
02:11:17,810 --> 02:11:22,810
He's got this podcast called hardcore
history and he does this really detailed

4292
02:11:22,821 --> 02:11:25,490
history of the Mongols over like five,

4293
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:28,250
five episodes and it's amazing.

4294
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:30,110
It's amazing.

4295
02:11:30,111 --> 02:11:32,180
It's just fucking craziness.

4296
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,360
The way these people just took over
Europe and just conquered and just the

4297
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:42,430
madness and the how they were so different
from anyone that existed at that time

4298
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:45,800
and that they were so extreme and intense,

4299
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:49,550
but at the same time that they
lived somewhere in the Amazon,

4300
02:11:49,551 --> 02:11:53,120
there are a bunch of people do an
Iowaska eating fish and you know,

4301
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:58,510
polyamorous people and it's amazing
that this all took place all along.

4302
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:00,560
And during the same time.

4303
02:12:00,770 --> 02:12:02,870
Do you ever read the
travels of Marco Polo?

4304
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:03,790
No.

4305
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:04,740
You know the story.

4306
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:08,750
He's like 14 hundreds or something
like that at 13 hundreds.

4307
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:10,250
And he went to.

4308
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:15,280
He was with the Mongols and he walked
all across Asia on the spice route with

4309
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:17,444
his uncles.

4310
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:18,590
And uh,

4311
02:12:18,650 --> 02:12:18,921
yeah,

4312
02:12:18,921 --> 02:12:20,090
he was with a,

4313
02:12:20,091 --> 02:12:22,940
I don't know if it was gang
con or Kubelet icon or which,

4314
02:12:22,941 --> 02:12:25,370
which of the Mongo kings it was.

4315
02:12:26,060 --> 02:12:28,490
And along the way talking
about interesting people,

4316
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:29,640
he stayed with the most.

4317
02:12:29,641 --> 02:12:29,871
Well,

4318
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:34,871
people of southwestern China
who still exists and uh,

4319
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:39,260
apparently still have this
very interesting marital,

4320
02:12:39,261 --> 02:12:39,560
well,

4321
02:12:39,560 --> 02:12:44,560
not even marital sexual behavior where
both men and women are completely

4322
02:12:46,371 --> 02:12:46,971
autonomous.

4323
02:12:46,971 --> 02:12:47,840
Sexual beings,

4324
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:49,160
you have sex with whomever you want.

4325
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:50,450
There's no slut shaming,

4326
02:12:50,451 --> 02:12:52,640
there's no shame involved
with multiple partners.

4327
02:12:52,641 --> 02:12:53,211
Whatever you do,

4328
02:12:53,211 --> 02:12:54,044
what you want.

4329
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,480
When a girl becomes sexually mature,

4330
02:12:56,481 --> 02:13:00,800
she gets her own room called a flower
room that has a door that opens into the

4331
02:13:00,801 --> 02:13:05,270
central courtyard of her mother's house
where she lives and also has a door that

4332
02:13:05,271 --> 02:13:06,470
opens into the street.

4333
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:08,390
And so that girl from,

4334
02:13:08,420 --> 02:13:08,631
you know,

4335
02:13:08,631 --> 02:13:09,111
13,

4336
02:13:09,111 --> 02:13:09,591
14,

4337
02:13:09,591 --> 02:13:10,011
whatever,

4338
02:13:10,011 --> 02:13:11,060
sexual maturity,

4339
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:12,920
she can let anyone.

4340
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:15,560
She wants to come in and spend
the night in her room with her.

4341
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:18,680
The only rule is he can't
be there for breakfast,

4342
02:13:19,060 --> 02:13:19,510
right?

4343
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:20,031
So no,

4344
02:13:20,031 --> 02:13:20,421
no,

4345
02:13:20,421 --> 02:13:21,710
nobody's invited for breakfast,

4346
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:23,030
get get out by sunrise,

4347
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:25,850
but she can sleep with whoever she wants.

4348
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:31,480
Then what happens when she gets pregnant
is that the child is cared for by

4349
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,440
her brothers and her sisters.

4350
02:13:34,770 --> 02:13:36,240
So as a man,

4351
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:39,750
your paternal responsibility
is to your sister's kids,

4352
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:42,150
not to your biological child.

4353
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,961
In fact,

4354
02:13:42,961 --> 02:13:44,910
biological fatherhood is,

4355
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:45,460
is,

4356
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:47,610
is a nonissue in this society is amazing.

4357
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:48,241
Yeah.

4358
02:13:48,241 --> 02:13:49,650
Really interesting society.

4359
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:50,550
It's,

4360
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:51,430
it's the law in,

4361
02:13:51,550 --> 02:13:52,610
in um,

4362
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:57,720
Marco Polo stayed with them and he
wrote about them and he thought typical

4363
02:13:57,721 --> 02:13:58,201
Italian,

4364
02:13:58,201 --> 02:13:58,351
right?

4365
02:13:58,351 --> 02:14:01,950
He thought that he was screwing these
women behind the men's backs and,

4366
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:02,280
you know,

4367
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:05,150
play Marco polos getting he was getting.

4368
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,480
So he just thought he was slick.

4369
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,100
He thought he was a cool guy,

4370
02:14:08,101 --> 02:14:09,720
but it turns out the women were just like,

4371
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:10,763
Yo,

4372
02:14:12,330 --> 02:14:13,163
that's funny.

4373
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:15,370
It is amazing.

4374
02:14:15,371 --> 02:14:17,230
When you think about the variables,

4375
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:21,730
it's amazing when you think about the
variety of different cultures that evolve

4376
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:26,760
simultaneously over the world and how is
it their environment that causes that?

4377
02:14:27,101 --> 02:14:27,701
Or is it,

4378
02:14:27,701 --> 02:14:30,730
this is a missionaries move in and
give them machetes and talk about their

4379
02:14:30,731 --> 02:14:31,251
ancestors.

4380
02:14:31,251 --> 02:14:33,170
I mean the various,

4381
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:34,960
the various things that happen or.

4382
02:14:34,961 --> 02:14:35,361
So.

4383
02:14:35,361 --> 02:14:36,194
Um,

4384
02:14:36,410 --> 02:14:37,870
and I know I confuse those two stores.

4385
02:14:37,871 --> 02:14:38,980
The missionary and the researcher.

4386
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:39,340
No,

4387
02:14:39,340 --> 02:14:40,270
it's all you mean.

4388
02:14:40,450 --> 02:14:40,831
Yeah.

4389
02:14:40,831 --> 02:14:45,680
And smallpox comes in and then
you get the ice ages and you know,

4390
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:46,740
but I,

4391
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:47,250
I,

4392
02:14:47,250 --> 02:14:48,930
I tend to be a materialist.

4393
02:14:48,931 --> 02:14:53,070
There's a book called cultural
materialism by Marvin Harris,

4394
02:14:53,071 --> 02:14:54,210
which is a great book.

4395
02:14:54,211 --> 02:14:57,090
And he wrote a more popular
book called Cannibals and Kings,

4396
02:14:57,091 --> 02:14:58,590
which covers some of the same stuff.

4397
02:14:59,040 --> 02:14:59,873
And He,

4398
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:00,121
like,

4399
02:15:00,121 --> 02:15:05,121
he looked at things like why are some
societies cannibals and others aren't,

4400
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:05,851
right.

4401
02:15:05,851 --> 02:15:06,601
So you've got the,

4402
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:06,820
you know,

4403
02:15:06,820 --> 02:15:10,500
the clash of European societies and
the Aztecs and the mind and all that.

4404
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:11,663
And so,

4405
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:12,071
you know,

4406
02:15:12,071 --> 02:15:14,640
you can't say the Europeans
weren't blood thirsty,

4407
02:15:14,670 --> 02:15:15,390
you know,

4408
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:16,860
crazy killers.

4409
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:19,680
They just didn't eat what they
killed the people they killed.

4410
02:15:19,681 --> 02:15:22,620
Whereas the Aztecs were killing the
people that are eating the people they

4411
02:15:22,621 --> 02:15:23,070
killed.

4412
02:15:23,070 --> 02:15:23,851
Why is that?

4413
02:15:23,851 --> 02:15:27,720
Or why on some South Pacific islands
where the people cannibalistic and others,

4414
02:15:27,721 --> 02:15:28,560
they weren't right.

4415
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:30,270
So what he did was he did a,

4416
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:32,430
a materialistic analysis.

4417
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:37,640
And what he found was that without
exception in the societies that were

4418
02:15:37,921 --> 02:15:38,910
cannibalistic,

4419
02:15:39,180 --> 02:15:44,180
there was no other source of protein
that didn't compete with humans for the

4420
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:45,534
same food.

4421
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:47,700
So like they didn't have pigs,

4422
02:15:47,770 --> 02:15:48,180
right?

4423
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,020
Pigs will eat stuff.

4424
02:15:49,021 --> 02:15:49,430
Humans,

4425
02:15:49,430 --> 02:15:50,263
canny,

4426
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:51,030
right?

4427
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:54,840
So you can raise pigs without
feeding them your own food.

4428
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:55,591
But dogs,

4429
02:15:55,591 --> 02:15:58,230
you feed them stuff you would
eat because dogs eat meat.

4430
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,070
Right?

4431
02:15:59,070 --> 02:16:02,970
So in Mexico there was
nothing that they could raise,

4432
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:03,540
no,

4433
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:03,950
no,

4434
02:16:03,950 --> 02:16:07,560
no animal that could be domesticated
that they could raise for meat.

4435
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:11,990
And so that's why they eat the dead
people because they were protein starved.

4436
02:16:12,150 --> 02:16:13,040
Wow.

4437
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:16,650
And then you apply that same thing to the
different islands in the South Pacific

4438
02:16:16,651 --> 02:16:17,484
and he found the same.

4439
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,750
And American Indians,

4440
02:16:18,790 --> 02:16:21,780
native Americans in the harshest
climates were the ones that we're tending

4441
02:16:21,781 --> 02:16:23,940
towards cannibalism like
towards the Great Lakes,

4442
02:16:23,941 --> 02:16:24,391
like the,

4443
02:16:24,391 --> 02:16:24,591
uh,

4444
02:16:24,591 --> 02:16:26,820
the native American people
from the Great Lakes area.

4445
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:28,170
Those are the ones that,

4446
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:28,450
uh,

4447
02:16:28,450 --> 02:16:28,840
there's uh,

4448
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:29,673
stories of

4449
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:31,030
cannibalizing people.

4450
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:31,840
Yeah.

4451
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:32,111
Yeah.

4452
02:16:32,111 --> 02:16:33,000
And you also have.

4453
02:16:34,310 --> 02:16:34,830
Yeah,

4454
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:36,130
in Midwinter Yeah,

4455
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:36,880
sure.

4456
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:37,551
But also in,

4457
02:16:37,551 --> 02:16:38,590
in that kind of thing,

4458
02:16:38,591 --> 02:16:42,040
you want to look at ritualistic
cannibalism versus like,

4459
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:42,461
okay,

4460
02:16:42,461 --> 02:16:43,181
dinner time,

4461
02:16:43,181 --> 02:16:44,014
you know?

4462
02:16:44,170 --> 02:16:44,590
Yeah.

4463
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:44,911
Because they,

4464
02:16:44,911 --> 02:16:49,630
they had some interesting torture
ceremonies as well in those Canadian Great

4465
02:16:49,631 --> 02:16:50,650
Lakes Iroquois,

4466
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:52,360
kind of that.

4467
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:54,220
It was an honor to be tortured to death.

4468
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:54,611
Oh,

4469
02:16:54,611 --> 02:16:55,400
Jesus.

4470
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:56,180
Yeah.

4471
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:56,590
The,

4472
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:56,740
uh,

4473
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:58,720
Steven Rinella guy that
I was telling you about,

4474
02:16:58,721 --> 02:16:59,620
his book mediator,

4475
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:00,790
I,

4476
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:05,790
he told me some crazy stories about
the people that lived off the Missouri,

4477
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:07,870
the Missouri River,

4478
02:17:08,020 --> 02:17:12,280
like in Montana and trappers and all
these different people that have these

4479
02:17:12,281 --> 02:17:14,200
conflicts with the Indians
and other would kill them.

4480
02:17:14,201 --> 02:17:16,510
And there was a lot of
cannibalism going on,

4481
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:18,940
a lot more than I would've ever imagined.

4482
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:21,700
It's because that's not really something
that gets brought up in high school

4483
02:17:21,701 --> 02:17:22,870
history or you know,

4484
02:17:23,020 --> 02:17:23,341
they don't,

4485
02:17:23,341 --> 02:17:24,340
they don't really tell you,

4486
02:17:24,341 --> 02:17:25,180
oh by the way,

4487
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:29,220
occasionally used to eat people
as did the settlers and our,

4488
02:17:29,470 --> 02:17:29,831
you know,

4489
02:17:29,831 --> 02:17:31,180
the Donner Party,

4490
02:17:31,300 --> 02:17:36,300
North America itself is one of the most
spectacular examples of how quickly

4491
02:17:37,181 --> 02:17:38,050
things can change.

4492
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:38,920
You're right,

4493
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:41,830
if you stop and think about North
America just a thousand years ago,

4494
02:17:41,890 --> 02:17:44,560
just $1,000 anywhere in Europe.

4495
02:17:44,561 --> 02:17:45,220
1,000.

4496
02:17:45,220 --> 02:17:46,450
It's like there's still people,

4497
02:17:46,451 --> 02:17:47,050
man,

4498
02:17:47,050 --> 02:17:48,520
they're still the nuttiness.

4499
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:49,240
There's still.

4500
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:51,910
I've hung out in bars that were
more than a thousand years old,

4501
02:17:51,970 --> 02:17:52,481
I'm sure.

4502
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:53,800
What is the oldest bar in,

4503
02:17:53,801 --> 02:17:54,080
um,

4504
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,930
in London as they're like a bar.

4505
02:17:55,931 --> 02:17:57,130
That's when like the fucking,

4506
02:17:57,640 --> 02:17:58,030
I dunno,

4507
02:17:58,030 --> 02:17:58,960
Barcelona,

4508
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,910
I could take you to them.

4509
02:18:00,940 --> 02:18:01,360
Uh,

4510
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:02,210
how old are below them?

4511
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:03,011
Well,

4512
02:18:03,011 --> 02:18:08,011
the oldest continually open
bar is from the 1700 I made.

4513
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:11,170
I'll bother and I've
been there many times.

4514
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,740
But the place I'm thinking of when,

4515
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:15,580
when I've said the thousand years old,

4516
02:18:15,581 --> 02:18:20,581
it's a bar down in the Gulf decaux
section of Barcelona where one wall of the

4517
02:18:20,711 --> 02:18:25,210
bar is a Roman wall from the original
Roman building that was there.

4518
02:18:25,480 --> 02:18:28,990
So you're like leaning up against
the Romans while drinking your beer.

4519
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:29,950
It's really cool.

4520
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:31,420
Holy Shit.

4521
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:33,483
Not America.

4522
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:36,880
And that's 2000 years
old a thousand years ago.

4523
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:37,990
No Manhattan,

4524
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:39,430
no Los Angeles,

4525
02:18:39,490 --> 02:18:40,780
no Chicago,

4526
02:18:41,040 --> 02:18:42,100
no Atlanta.

4527
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:44,290
Just stop and think of that alone.

4528
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:49,291
Just what radical changes to the landscape
we've seen over the past few hundred

4529
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:50,201
years.

4530
02:18:50,201 --> 02:18:52,270
We get a thousand thousand years ago.

4531
02:18:52,271 --> 02:18:54,490
You wind up in New York on
a boat and what are you,

4532
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:55,383
what are you looking at?

4533
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:57,400
Looking at some fucking wooden shacks.

4534
02:18:57,770 --> 02:19:00,190
The huddled up together
eating beaver pelts.

4535
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:01,061
Fuck you.

4536
02:19:01,061 --> 02:19:01,894
Looking at

4537
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:05,860
this thing has changed so fast.

4538
02:19:06,010 --> 02:19:06,200
I,

4539
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:09,410
I met a guy at a wedding a
few years ago who was like,

4540
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:12,460
one of the world's leading
experts on seashells.

4541
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:14,620
Sounds Kinda boring,

4542
02:19:14,621 --> 02:19:14,831
right?

4543
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:19,810
But we ended up talking about wampum
and he told me something I'd never read

4544
02:19:19,811 --> 02:19:20,644
anywhere,

4545
02:19:20,770 --> 02:19:21,041
which,

4546
02:19:21,041 --> 02:19:21,311
you know,

4547
02:19:21,311 --> 02:19:23,200
wampum writers made from seashells.

4548
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:24,063
This was like the,

4549
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:25,391
the name,

4550
02:19:25,391 --> 02:19:28,250
but I don't know what it
was that native Americans

4551
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:29,600
used in the northeast.

4552
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:30,680
Right when,

4553
02:19:30,740 --> 02:19:35,510
when the Dutch first arrived in the very
early days of New York is what reminded

4554
02:19:35,511 --> 02:19:36,344
me of it.

4555
02:19:36,750 --> 02:19:41,120
It was made from a particular type of
seashell that only grew in a certain area.

4556
02:19:41,660 --> 02:19:43,460
So like all currencies,

4557
02:19:43,461 --> 02:19:45,650
it had a very restricted source,

4558
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:46,011
you know,

4559
02:19:46,011 --> 02:19:47,200
like gold or whatever,

4560
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:48,660
beaver pelts or whatever it was.

4561
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:49,340
It's,

4562
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:49,641
by the way,

4563
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:49,821
you know,

4564
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:51,170
that's why 20 bucks,

4565
02:19:51,890 --> 02:19:52,850
that's deer skins.

4566
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:56,240
That deer screens are used as
currency and the colonial period.

4567
02:19:56,241 --> 02:19:56,511
Yeah,

4568
02:19:56,511 --> 02:19:57,920
that's why we say 20 bucks.

4569
02:19:58,580 --> 02:19:58,791
Yeah.

4570
02:19:58,791 --> 02:19:59,241
But anyway,

4571
02:19:59,241 --> 02:20:00,870
so the Wampum,

4572
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:04,760
they'd make these belts of wampum that
you could use to buy and sell things.

4573
02:20:04,761 --> 02:20:05,300
Right?

4574
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:10,300
So the Dutch clever bastards that they
are figured out how they were making this

4575
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:13,340
wampum and what sort of
seashells it was and they,

4576
02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:17,060
they learn to cultivate
that particular molecule.

4577
02:20:17,950 --> 02:20:19,610
They were basically printing,

4578
02:20:19,611 --> 02:20:19,890
you know,

4579
02:20:19,890 --> 02:20:21,140
counterfeit wampum.

4580
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:22,411
Wow.

4581
02:20:22,411 --> 02:20:25,520
So they didn't even just rip off the
Indians when they bought Manhattan.

4582
02:20:25,550 --> 02:20:27,530
They bought it with fake money.

4583
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:28,730
Holy Shit.

4584
02:20:28,790 --> 02:20:29,810
Fake Indian money.

4585
02:20:29,870 --> 02:20:30,070
Yeah,

4586
02:20:30,070 --> 02:20:30,950
that's hilarious.

4587
02:20:30,951 --> 02:20:32,540
They bought it with seashells.

4588
02:20:32,780 --> 02:20:37,670
And imagine how much your condo goes for
now and just think that the whole thing

4589
02:20:37,970 --> 02:20:39,320
went for seashells.

4590
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:42,620
That's a change in the real
estate market right there.

4591
02:20:42,990 --> 02:20:43,521
You know what I love?

4592
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:46,100
I lived in Manhattan for a few
years and last year I was there.

4593
02:20:46,101 --> 02:20:50,660
I worked in a construction site and
since we're just talking randomly

4594
02:20:50,661 --> 02:20:51,560
interesting things here,

4595
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:52,641
the guy,

4596
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:57,641
one of the laborers on the construction
site explain to me why the buildings are

4597
02:20:58,101 --> 02:21:01,760
really high in midtown and then they
go down and then they go back up and

4598
02:21:01,761 --> 02:21:04,520
they're high again down in Wall
Street and the financial district.

4599
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:06,720
If you look at Manhattan from New Jersey,

4600
02:21:06,721 --> 02:21:09,000
you're from queens or
Brooklyn or whatever the.

4601
02:21:09,680 --> 02:21:12,560
I always thought that was just like
what you're saying is like there are all

4602
02:21:12,561 --> 02:21:15,590
these strange things that come together,

4603
02:21:15,591 --> 02:21:17,390
whether it's finance or you know,

4604
02:21:17,391 --> 02:21:18,131
whatever happens,

4605
02:21:18,131 --> 02:21:18,471
stand.

4606
02:21:18,471 --> 02:21:19,710
Somebody wanted to it here.

4607
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:20,960
There it turns out,

4608
02:21:20,961 --> 02:21:21,191
no,

4609
02:21:21,191 --> 02:21:24,140
there's a logic to this
and the logic is that the,

4610
02:21:24,590 --> 02:21:25,310
the,

4611
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:26,510
the rock that grant,

4612
02:21:26,600 --> 02:21:27,040
the,

4613
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:32,040
the geological rock comes up near the
surface at midtown and then it goes way

4614
02:21:32,181 --> 02:21:35,530
down again and that Anders Soho
in the village and all that,

4615
02:21:35,531 --> 02:21:38,600
and then it comes back up close
to the surface at Wall Street.

4616
02:21:38,930 --> 02:21:40,880
So to build a really tall building,

4617
02:21:40,881 --> 02:21:41,750
you have to drill,

4618
02:21:41,751 --> 02:21:42,950
anchor it into the rock.

4619
02:21:43,310 --> 02:21:47,600
So you can't do that where there's a lot
of dirt you'd have to like dig down so

4620
02:21:47,601 --> 02:21:50,120
far to get to excavate the whole.

4621
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:55,340
So you can only build a 50 story building
where the bedrock is close to the

4622
02:21:55,341 --> 02:21:57,830
surface and you can anchor it into there.

4623
02:21:57,920 --> 02:21:58,191
Right?

4624
02:21:58,191 --> 02:21:59,570
So it's stable.

4625
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,361
Totally makes sense.

4626
02:22:00,361 --> 02:22:05,361
So what you're seeing when you look
at that skyline is like an echo of the

4627
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:06,980
geology of the island.

4628
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,370
Wow.

4629
02:22:08,370 --> 02:22:08,780
Interesting.

4630
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:09,590
That is a,

4631
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:10,940
that is absolutely fascinating.

4632
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:12,133
Um,

4633
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:16,130
brings me up to this quote I was going
to bring up earlier when you talked about

4634
02:22:16,131 --> 02:22:16,970
Marshall Mcluhan.

4635
02:22:17,390 --> 02:22:19,220
A lot of folks don't know
Marshall Mcluhan was,

4636
02:22:19,221 --> 02:22:22,160
but he said a lot of amazing things
and one of the things he said,

4637
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:24,710
I think it was either the fifties,

4638
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,250
I think he said in the fifties,

4639
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:29,880
he said that man becomes the
sex organs of the machine world.

4640
02:22:30,420 --> 02:22:31,253
That's beautiful.

4641
02:22:31,880 --> 02:22:33,630
The craziest statement ever.

4642
02:22:33,860 --> 02:22:36,440
Have you stop and think about
how premature it was and our,

4643
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:36,740
our,

4644
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:36,961
our,

4645
02:22:36,961 --> 02:22:41,961
how precocious it was to say that in
whatever he said that in 1950 or 1960 and

4646
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:47,940
look at what's going on now with our
symbiotic connection to technology.

4647
02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:50,130
The true machine that's taking over,

4648
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:50,671
that's,

4649
02:22:50,671 --> 02:22:52,920
I'm writing that down because
I'm going to use that thing.

4650
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:56,310
I thought about that so many times
without even having read his quote,

4651
02:22:56,311 --> 02:23:00,750
but I wasn't able to put it so eloquently
in my head because that if that the

4652
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:02,640
faith look like a life form.

4653
02:23:02,670 --> 02:23:05,040
I mean I have skeletons in my garage.

4654
02:23:05,370 --> 02:23:06,270
It's an old Mac,

4655
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:11,271
old shitty fucking like Tan thing
with the stupid rainbow apple on it.

4656
02:23:11,991 --> 02:23:12,990
I have one of those things.

4657
02:23:12,991 --> 02:23:14,190
It's like really old.

4658
02:23:14,570 --> 02:23:15,331
It's hilarious.

4659
02:23:15,331 --> 02:23:15,871
I look at it,

4660
02:23:15,871 --> 02:23:16,051
I'm like,

4661
02:23:16,051 --> 02:23:17,050
this is like a dinosaur,

4662
02:23:17,070 --> 02:23:19,170
so might as well be like a dead dinosaur,

4663
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:21,890
dead useless thing and now you know,

4664
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,490
we don't have dinosaurs anymore.

4665
02:23:23,491 --> 02:23:24,630
Now we got chickens,

4666
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:24,991
you know,

4667
02:23:24,991 --> 02:23:25,850
now whatever.

4668
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:26,893
I mean,

4669
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:28,260
it really does seem like.

4670
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,170
Yeah,

4671
02:23:29,170 --> 02:23:33,440
I wrote an article about the
future of sex for this European.

4672
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:34,930
They called the European magazine.

4673
02:23:34,931 --> 02:23:35,060
It's,

4674
02:23:35,060 --> 02:23:36,550
I guess it's a German magazine,

4675
02:23:36,551 --> 02:23:38,110
but they publish in English as well.

4676
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:41,920
He asked me to write this thing a few
months ago and I could have used that

4677
02:23:41,921 --> 02:23:43,840
McLuhan quote that was really good.

4678
02:23:44,050 --> 02:23:49,050
But I said like basically the way I see
the future of sex is peeling off in two

4679
02:23:49,301 --> 02:23:53,620
different possible directions depending
upon whether there's world collapse or

4680
02:23:53,621 --> 02:23:54,454
not.

4681
02:23:54,790 --> 02:23:55,660
And uh,

4682
02:23:55,960 --> 02:23:57,490
if there's not,

4683
02:23:57,670 --> 02:24:01,960
I see us as many people
do merging with machines,

4684
02:24:01,961 --> 02:24:02,471
what do they call it?

4685
02:24:02,471 --> 02:24:03,430
The singularity,

4686
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:06,170
but also in terms of
sexuality that you know,

4687
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:08,020
now we've got flashlights,

4688
02:24:08,050 --> 02:24:11,530
but in a few years we're going
to have holographic images.

4689
02:24:11,531 --> 02:24:16,531
We're going to have like the technology
is always driven by this sexual hunger.

4690
02:24:17,230 --> 02:24:21,610
There's a book called the erotic
engine where this guy argues that every

4691
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,000
communication advance was driven
by money coming from orotic energy,

4692
02:24:27,371 --> 02:24:28,090
you know,

4693
02:24:28,090 --> 02:24:31,960
vhs tapes and then dvds and the Internet,

4694
02:24:31,961 --> 02:24:34,630
like all the first monies
coming in for porn,

4695
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:35,490
you know,

4696
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:36,580
even photography

4697
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:37,121
first,

4698
02:24:37,121 --> 02:24:38,030
a adapters,

4699
02:24:38,031 --> 02:24:40,460
first time adapters like
html five and all that.

4700
02:24:40,461 --> 02:24:45,461
As soon as soon as people realized that
the iphone wasn't going to go with flash

4701
02:24:45,800 --> 02:24:50,800
and that a html five seemed like the
future when it comes to a animated things

4702
02:24:51,411 --> 02:24:52,244
online,

4703
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:53,930
porn went right to it.

4704
02:24:53,931 --> 02:24:54,350
Sure.

4705
02:24:54,350 --> 02:24:54,741
You know,

4706
02:24:54,741 --> 02:24:56,150
whereas a lot of websites,

4707
02:24:56,151 --> 02:24:56,601
you still,

4708
02:24:56,601 --> 02:24:59,510
you go to it on an iphone and
it'll show you the adobe thing.

4709
02:24:59,511 --> 02:25:01,940
Not supported and not porn.

4710
02:25:01,970 --> 02:25:04,100
They figured out right
away I had him on the ball.

4711
02:25:04,101 --> 02:25:04,251
Yeah.

4712
02:25:04,251 --> 02:25:06,500
They gotta make it so you could
watch people fuck on your phone.

4713
02:25:06,650 --> 02:25:07,483
Yeah.

4714
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:10,310
Isn't it amazing though
that that is a sort of,

4715
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:11,203
again,

4716
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:12,170
in the closet,

4717
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:15,980
it's sort of a background sort of reality,

4718
02:25:16,220 --> 02:25:19,330
like all the banks in Miami
being funded by cocaine.

4719
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:20,480
Everybody knows it,

4720
02:25:20,481 --> 02:25:21,590
but nobody talks about it.

4721
02:25:21,610 --> 02:25:21,731
Right.

4722
02:25:21,731 --> 02:25:22,090
You know,

4723
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:23,090
why is there so many banks,

4724
02:25:23,170 --> 02:25:23,531
Miami?

4725
02:25:23,531 --> 02:25:24,010
Because that's where the

4726
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,090
fucking cocaine came from.

4727
02:25:25,420 --> 02:25:26,080
Why?

4728
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:26,980
Why is,

4729
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:29,680
why is technology moving
towards html five?

4730
02:25:29,681 --> 02:25:30,490
Why is what,

4731
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:32,650
what is online streaming technology?

4732
02:25:32,651 --> 02:25:33,401
Where's its roots?

4733
02:25:33,401 --> 02:25:34,990
Its roots are in people watching people.

4734
02:25:34,991 --> 02:25:35,800
Fuck.

4735
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:36,880
That's where they got it down.

4736
02:25:36,881 --> 02:25:40,300
That's where they get really good
at it and that's where the money is.

4737
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:41,680
And then that might.

4738
02:25:41,681 --> 02:25:41,921
I mean,

4739
02:25:41,921 --> 02:25:45,160
what percentage of that was responsible
for the development of the CD Rom?

4740
02:25:45,161 --> 02:25:45,994
What percentage of the.

4741
02:25:46,270 --> 02:25:46,541
You know,

4742
02:25:46,541 --> 02:25:51,430
how much I would like to know about the
erotic engine that he talks about all

4743
02:25:51,431 --> 02:25:51,800
that.

4744
02:25:51,800 --> 02:25:52,420
Yeah,

4745
02:25:52,420 --> 02:25:54,610
because before the Internet came along,

4746
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:57,460
I mean how many people
bought movies as supposed to?

4747
02:25:57,461 --> 02:25:59,050
How many people bought dirty movies?

4748
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:01,150
What was the share of the market?

4749
02:26:02,020 --> 02:26:02,771
Fucking chunk,

4750
02:26:02,771 --> 02:26:03,550
right.

4751
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:03,821
Well,

4752
02:26:03,821 --> 02:26:04,654
Miss Cinemas,

4753
02:26:05,420 --> 02:26:06,253
the porn.

4754
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:09,610
That was another thing from your book
that I found completely fascinating.

4755
02:26:09,650 --> 02:26:14,650
I didn't think about was how we have
this idea of corporate America not being

4756
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:18,280
not profit profiting in porn,

4757
02:26:18,610 --> 02:26:23,610
but how in fact like chains of hotels are
like the biggest porn providers in the

4758
02:26:26,621 --> 02:26:27,160
world.

4759
02:26:27,160 --> 02:26:27,710
Yeah,

4760
02:26:27,710 --> 02:26:28,071
yeah.

4761
02:26:28,071 --> 02:26:32,060
They're making huge proportion of their
profits from those on demand movies.

4762
02:26:32,300 --> 02:26:33,860
Last week when I was in San Diego,

4763
02:26:33,861 --> 02:26:37,890
I literally went through the whole
entire list of porn because they were so

4764
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:38,331
funny.

4765
02:26:38,331 --> 02:26:38,721
Titles.

4766
02:26:38,721 --> 02:26:41,600
It was probably 300 titles
that they just had their

4767
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:44,120
and they're selling for like what,

4768
02:26:44,121 --> 02:26:46,820
20 bucks or $10,

4769
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:47,691
whatever it is.

4770
02:26:47,691 --> 02:26:49,640
I mean that's pure profit
at a certain point,

4771
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:49,881
you know,

4772
02:26:49,881 --> 02:26:52,820
and once they pay the licensing
fee off or whatever it is,

4773
02:26:53,210 --> 02:26:54,210
so them.

4774
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:59,060
And you know what it was the other example
you had of people that were profiting

4775
02:26:59,061 --> 02:27:00,590
off point that you would not expect.

4776
02:27:02,300 --> 02:27:02,840
Yeah,

4777
02:27:02,840 --> 02:27:03,441
I don't remember.

4778
02:27:03,441 --> 02:27:04,101
I remember the,

4779
02:27:04,101 --> 02:27:08,060
the corporate thing you're talking about
and I think the corporation in question

4780
02:27:08,061 --> 02:27:11,660
might've been coca cola or somebody
owned by Mormons or something.

4781
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:15,980
It was some like really
conservative public image,

4782
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:19,070
but they were the biggest
supplier to the hotel chains.

4783
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:20,751
Yeah.

4784
02:27:20,751 --> 02:27:23,360
And they were definitely
going to be hilarious.

4785
02:27:25,870 --> 02:27:30,490
Chick fil a is only into chickens
and Dixon Asad said the other day I

4786
02:27:30,491 --> 02:27:32,740
interviewed Nina Hartley from podcast.

4787
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:34,630
She's really interested in
how to run away from her.

4788
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,440
She was on Kevin Prayers podcast and as
soon as she's talking about how she only

4789
02:27:38,441 --> 02:27:39,510
has sex with gloves on,

4790
02:27:39,520 --> 02:27:39,910
I was like,

4791
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:40,743
bitch,

4792
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:42,550
you lost me.

4793
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:43,923
I lost me bitch.

4794
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:44,763
I got to go.

4795
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:50,190
She only had sex with Linda fisting
and finger souls and plus these and she

4796
02:27:50,411 --> 02:27:51,460
doesn't want fingernails.

4797
02:27:51,461 --> 02:27:52,420
And I mean it makes sense,

4798
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:54,160
but it's because she's
a goddamn professional.

4799
02:27:54,161 --> 02:27:55,960
I mean she's got the pro clinic goal.

4800
02:27:55,961 --> 02:27:59,500
Snap a rubber glove approach to sex.

4801
02:27:59,501 --> 02:28:00,550
She's also a nurse.

4802
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:04,300
She has her own flashlight,

4803
02:28:04,330 --> 02:28:04,571
right?

4804
02:28:04,571 --> 02:28:07,690
She's got her own and resembles
a metal hitting a large mammal.

4805
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:09,793
What you would get.

4806
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:12,843
Nice Lady.

4807
02:28:13,150 --> 02:28:13,983
She's not freak.

4808
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:14,910
She's.

4809
02:28:14,910 --> 02:28:15,130
Yeah,

4810
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:15,910
she is smart.

4811
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:17,410
She's an old hippie freak.

4812
02:28:17,470 --> 02:28:18,191
That's what she is,

4813
02:28:18,191 --> 02:28:19,024
you know?

4814
02:28:19,110 --> 02:28:19,540
Yeah.

4815
02:28:19,540 --> 02:28:20,110
But I got walk.

4816
02:28:20,110 --> 02:28:21,130
That's where I got to walk away.

4817
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:22,043
We start talking about

4818
02:28:22,110 --> 02:28:23,510
I only have sex with gloves on.

4819
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:24,530
Okay.

4820
02:28:24,531 --> 02:28:27,110
Last me gold bond on it.

4821
02:28:27,111 --> 02:28:28,070
And then I rub it,

4822
02:28:28,270 --> 02:28:29,450
she's not that old dude.

4823
02:28:29,480 --> 02:28:30,420
You made her like,

4824
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:32,420
she's something past a MILF though,

4825
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:33,254
right?

4826
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,320
It's like we talked to.

4827
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:36,560
She's a new categories.

4828
02:28:36,730 --> 02:28:37,990
Fifty three,

4829
02:28:37,991 --> 02:28:38,591
54,

4830
02:28:38,591 --> 02:28:39,200
somewhere in there.

4831
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:41,290
Still fucking throwing down.

4832
02:28:41,380 --> 02:28:41,861
Broken down.

4833
02:28:41,861 --> 02:28:42,790
She's an educator.

4834
02:28:42,791 --> 02:28:43,580
She's good.

4835
02:28:43,580 --> 02:28:46,840
You're talking about gloves mean we had
a friend of mine told me this story.

4836
02:28:47,260 --> 02:28:48,010
He,

4837
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:51,250
he was with a woman who is polyamorous.

4838
02:28:51,320 --> 02:28:52,150
Right?

4839
02:28:52,150 --> 02:28:54,290
And so he,

4840
02:28:54,330 --> 02:28:55,150
he,

4841
02:28:55,150 --> 02:28:55,451
you know,

4842
02:28:55,451 --> 02:28:58,240
whatever they're going out to dinner
and he gets a text from her a few hours

4843
02:28:58,241 --> 02:28:59,380
before dinner saying,

4844
02:28:59,890 --> 02:29:00,300
look,

4845
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:00,790
I'm,

4846
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:04,270
I just want to be upfront about this
as polyamorous people off in art.

4847
02:29:04,930 --> 02:29:08,170
My agreement with my partner is,

4848
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:09,393
um,

4849
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:10,420
what,

4850
02:29:10,420 --> 02:29:11,710
what was the detail or the,

4851
02:29:11,711 --> 02:29:13,930
the agreement is no,

4852
02:29:14,050 --> 02:29:15,310
no,

4853
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,180
uh,

4854
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,080
intercourse,

4855
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,350
so we can do whatever
else but no intercourse.

4856
02:29:20,351 --> 02:29:21,130
Right?

4857
02:29:21,130 --> 02:29:21,881
So He's thinking,

4858
02:29:21,881 --> 02:29:22,031
well,

4859
02:29:22,031 --> 02:29:22,271
Geez,

4860
02:29:22,271 --> 02:29:23,260
I thought it was just dinner.

4861
02:29:23,320 --> 02:29:23,621
Right?

4862
02:29:23,621 --> 02:29:24,191
So I guess,

4863
02:29:24,191 --> 02:29:24,640
right.

4864
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:25,750
That's pretty good news.

4865
02:29:25,751 --> 02:29:26,030
I mean,

4866
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:28,640
it seems like everything
else is on the table.

4867
02:29:29,320 --> 02:29:32,410
So then they end up back
in her place and she says,

4868
02:29:32,411 --> 02:29:32,531
oh,

4869
02:29:32,531 --> 02:29:32,921
sorry,

4870
02:29:32,921 --> 02:29:33,190
the,

4871
02:29:33,190 --> 02:29:33,551
you know,

4872
02:29:33,551 --> 02:29:33,881
we,

4873
02:29:33,881 --> 02:29:35,170
the rule changed a little bit.

4874
02:29:35,170 --> 02:29:35,921
Now it's like,

4875
02:29:35,921 --> 02:29:38,800
I know genital contact.

4876
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:39,940
So they're making out.

4877
02:29:39,941 --> 02:29:40,511
And she says,

4878
02:29:40,511 --> 02:29:40,781
okay,

4879
02:29:40,781 --> 02:29:41,171
sorry,

4880
02:29:41,171 --> 02:29:41,351
you know,

4881
02:29:41,351 --> 02:29:43,300
my boyfriend says no genital contact,

4882
02:29:43,301 --> 02:29:43,900
right?

4883
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:44,471
So he says,

4884
02:29:44,471 --> 02:29:44,711
okay,

4885
02:29:44,711 --> 02:29:45,544
that's fine.

4886
02:29:45,700 --> 02:29:47,140
So then she says,

4887
02:29:47,141 --> 02:29:47,660
wait a minute,

4888
02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:48,750
they're getting all hot and heavy.

4889
02:29:48,760 --> 02:29:49,121
She says,

4890
02:29:49,121 --> 02:29:49,511
wait a minute,

4891
02:29:49,511 --> 02:29:50,261
she goes to the other room,

4892
02:29:50,261 --> 02:29:55,240
she comes back and she's got these black
latex gloves on and she starts giving

4893
02:29:55,241 --> 02:29:57,340
him a hand job because like,

4894
02:29:57,341 --> 02:30:02,341
apparently with the gloves there's no
contact and then she gives him a Dildo.

4895
02:30:02,771 --> 02:30:03,521
So there's like,

4896
02:30:03,521 --> 02:30:05,530
all this crazy stuff is going on.

4897
02:30:05,860 --> 02:30:07,180
And he told me this story.

4898
02:30:07,181 --> 02:30:07,750
He's like,

4899
02:30:07,750 --> 02:30:12,400
this was so far beyond what
I would have anticipated.

4900
02:30:12,820 --> 02:30:13,421
Exactly.

4901
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:16,510
And it got really freaky
because of these rules.

4902
02:30:17,020 --> 02:30:17,351
Of course,

4903
02:30:17,351 --> 02:30:18,820
it made me think about drugs,

4904
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:19,511
you know,

4905
02:30:19,511 --> 02:30:20,050
like,

4906
02:30:20,050 --> 02:30:20,500
hey,

4907
02:30:20,500 --> 02:30:22,390
if coca leaf is illegal,

4908
02:30:22,391 --> 02:30:24,070
well then they're going to make cocaine.

4909
02:30:24,520 --> 02:30:24,971
You know,

4910
02:30:24,971 --> 02:30:25,750
if grasp,

4911
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:27,590
if you can't just grow
grass in your backyard,

4912
02:30:27,591 --> 02:30:29,050
then you're going to get hydroponic,

4913
02:30:29,051 --> 02:30:29,490
you know,

4914
02:30:29,490 --> 02:30:30,490
super grass.

4915
02:30:30,491 --> 02:30:32,470
It's like you make these rules,

4916
02:30:32,830 --> 02:30:33,161
you know,

4917
02:30:33,161 --> 02:30:34,000
like hard liquor,

4918
02:30:34,390 --> 02:30:35,223
right?

4919
02:30:35,320 --> 02:30:38,290
Prohibition is what started
gin and all this kind of stuff,

4920
02:30:38,291 --> 02:30:38,830
right?

4921
02:30:38,830 --> 02:30:43,830
So you make rules to try to contain a
natural human appetite and what happens is

4922
02:30:45,851 --> 02:30:46,960
it gets explosive,

4923
02:30:47,620 --> 02:30:47,921
right?

4924
02:30:47,921 --> 02:30:48,760
Just like a bomb.

4925
02:30:48,970 --> 02:30:52,990
The bomb needs the
containment to be explosive,

4926
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:54,730
otherwise it's just nothing.

4927
02:30:55,370 --> 02:30:59,600
It gets a natural human inclination that
I could see loud and clearly with my

4928
02:30:59,601 --> 02:31:00,410
kids.

4929
02:31:00,410 --> 02:31:02,630
When you try to keep
kids from doing things,

4930
02:31:02,631 --> 02:31:03,500
they automatically like,

4931
02:31:03,501 --> 02:31:04,760
why the fuck should I listen to you?

4932
02:31:04,761 --> 02:31:05,120
I want,

4933
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:05,953
that's what I want to do.

4934
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:06,681
They get angry.

4935
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:11,681
It's like it's a natural human response
because all of our entire history of

4936
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:14,930
humanity has been people
trying to dominate people,

4937
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:16,100
people trying to control people.

4938
02:31:16,101 --> 02:31:18,860
So our natural thing is to resist.

4939
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:22,230
It's why the biggest slut always
have like super religious parents.

4940
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:23,970
There you go.

4941
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:24,721
Jesus Christ.

4942
02:31:24,721 --> 02:31:25,021
Folks.

4943
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:25,890
Is it that easy?

4944
02:31:26,160 --> 02:31:29,550
Does Dr Christopher Ryan
have to explain it that easy?

4945
02:31:30,330 --> 02:31:31,000
Yes.

4946
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:31,771
Nina Hartley's.

4947
02:31:31,771 --> 02:31:32,880
Parents interestingly,

4948
02:31:32,881 --> 02:31:35,850
were communists who were
blacklisted in Berkeley.

4949
02:31:36,210 --> 02:31:36,541
Really?

4950
02:31:36,541 --> 02:31:37,260
Interesting.

4951
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:37,501
Yeah,

4952
02:31:37,501 --> 02:31:38,334
she's an old hippy.

4953
02:31:38,610 --> 02:31:39,060
She's a,

4954
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:39,510
she's a,

4955
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:40,530
she's an odd case.

4956
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:41,520
Yeah,

4957
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,120
she like,

4958
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:43,910
she's one of the rare ones where you,

4959
02:31:43,950 --> 02:31:45,990
you always connect human,

4960
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:50,070
like girls who were into
porn or getting into that,

4961
02:31:50,071 --> 02:31:51,690
you always connected with
some sort of an abuse.

4962
02:31:51,750 --> 02:31:52,100
Yeah.

4963
02:31:52,100 --> 02:31:52,371
You know,

4964
02:31:52,371 --> 02:31:53,470
some human aberration,

4965
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:57,630
but now with her she seems like just
a crazy old hippie freak doesn't seem

4966
02:31:57,631 --> 02:31:58,080
dirty.

4967
02:31:58,080 --> 02:31:59,020
It's fun.

4968
02:31:59,060 --> 02:31:59,500
Like,

4969
02:31:59,500 --> 02:32:00,170
yeah,

4970
02:32:00,170 --> 02:32:00,930
it's weird.

4971
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:01,580
Yeah,

4972
02:32:01,580 --> 02:32:01,831
no,

4973
02:32:01,831 --> 02:32:02,191
she's,

4974
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:03,360
she's an interesting person.

4975
02:32:03,361 --> 02:32:03,661
I enjoy.

4976
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:04,080
What is the,

4977
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:07,770
what is the weirdest thing you've gotten
out of this study of human sexuality

4978
02:32:07,771 --> 02:32:08,320
because it's,

4979
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:11,550
your book is incredibly enlightening
and I think Dunkin's uh,

4980
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:12,030
his,

4981
02:32:12,030 --> 02:32:12,481
his,

4982
02:32:12,481 --> 02:32:12,810
uh,

4983
02:32:12,810 --> 02:32:17,810
definition of you as a shame exercise is
really a perfect one because it puts so

4984
02:32:17,881 --> 02:32:19,650
many things into perspective and it makes,

4985
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:24,000
it makes so many weird patterns
of behavior that we follow.

4986
02:32:24,001 --> 02:32:26,820
It's sort of enlightens
you on the origins of them,

4987
02:32:26,821 --> 02:32:30,360
but what is like one of the weirdest
things that you've found in this pursuit?

4988
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:31,791
Well yeah,

4989
02:32:31,791 --> 02:32:32,720
there are so many,

4990
02:32:32,721 --> 02:32:32,991
you know,

4991
02:32:32,991 --> 02:32:36,290
obviously these things pop
up in every conversation,

4992
02:32:36,291 --> 02:32:37,820
but I think one of the most,

4993
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:38,690
uh,

4994
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:39,720
memorable and,

4995
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:44,750
and moving in a way was when I went
looking for the first documented case of a

4996
02:32:47,210 --> 02:32:48,620
key parties and,

4997
02:32:48,621 --> 02:32:48,860
you know,

4998
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:50,970
partner swapping and
that sort of thing in,

4999
02:32:51,020 --> 02:32:52,490
in modern America,

5000
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:55,430
not these sex in the 19th century,

5001
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:56,870
20th century stuff.

5002
02:32:57,410 --> 02:32:58,730
I thought it would be,

5003
02:32:59,180 --> 02:32:59,650
um,

5004
02:32:59,650 --> 02:32:59,930
you know,

5005
02:32:59,930 --> 02:33:03,860
some commune in Berkeley with a bunch
of hippies and Hendrix posters and,

5006
02:33:03,861 --> 02:33:04,131
you know,

5007
02:33:04,131 --> 02:33:05,420
whatever waterbeds and,

5008
02:33:05,421 --> 02:33:05,570
you know,

5009
02:33:05,570 --> 02:33:06,403
that Kinda thing.

5010
02:33:06,740 --> 02:33:07,573
And uh,

5011
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:08,271
but it wasn't,

5012
02:33:08,271 --> 02:33:13,271
it was World War Two fighter pilots in
the Pacific who had the highest fatality

5013
02:33:15,381 --> 02:33:18,170
rate of any branch of the
military in World War II.

5014
02:33:18,200 --> 02:33:22,820
Twenty five percent of them died in
action when they were back on base,

5015
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:25,640
I guess in Hawaii or the west coast.

5016
02:33:26,240 --> 02:33:31,240
They had key parties where they and their
partners would come to these parties,

5017
02:33:32,330 --> 02:33:33,200
put the keys in,

5018
02:33:33,201 --> 02:33:33,421
you know,

5019
02:33:33,421 --> 02:33:34,460
like in the ice storm.

5020
02:33:34,460 --> 02:33:35,390
I don't know if you saw that movie,

5021
02:33:35,570 --> 02:33:36,400
great movie,

5022
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:37,233
um,

5023
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:41,030
and randomly sleep with each
other's wives or girlfriends.

5024
02:33:41,031 --> 02:33:41,864
Right?

5025
02:33:41,900 --> 02:33:42,830
And um,

5026
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:44,713
you know,

5027
02:33:44,870 --> 02:33:46,220
these are all like super,

5028
02:33:46,300 --> 02:33:47,060
you know,

5029
02:33:47,060 --> 02:33:47,781
genetically.

5030
02:33:47,781 --> 02:33:48,050
Yeah,

5031
02:33:48,050 --> 02:33:48,890
good looking dudes.

5032
02:33:48,891 --> 02:33:51,950
All Alpha males obviously and the
women they were with were hot.

5033
02:33:51,951 --> 02:33:53,720
So I don't think anyone was worried about,

5034
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:54,290
you know,

5035
02:33:54,290 --> 02:33:56,030
pulling the short straw to the,

5036
02:33:56,470 --> 02:33:57,320
the short key.

5037
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:58,040
Um,

5038
02:33:58,040 --> 02:33:58,873
but,

5039
02:33:58,910 --> 02:33:59,450
you know,

5040
02:33:59,450 --> 02:33:59,630
I,

5041
02:33:59,630 --> 02:34:00,620
I thought,

5042
02:34:00,621 --> 02:34:00,831
well,

5043
02:34:00,831 --> 02:34:01,401
okay sure,

5044
02:34:01,401 --> 02:34:02,600
these guys are facing death.

5045
02:34:02,630 --> 02:34:03,920
They want to get it while they can.

5046
02:34:03,921 --> 02:34:04,400
Right.

5047
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,770
But then in the interviews
I read with the survivors,

5048
02:34:06,771 --> 02:34:07,700
what they said was,

5049
02:34:07,970 --> 02:34:08,331
yeah,

5050
02:34:08,331 --> 02:34:08,661
okay,

5051
02:34:08,661 --> 02:34:09,441
we were young,

5052
02:34:09,441 --> 02:34:10,101
we were strong,

5053
02:34:10,101 --> 02:34:10,371
we were,

5054
02:34:10,371 --> 02:34:10,511
have,

5055
02:34:10,511 --> 02:34:10,920
you know,

5056
02:34:10,920 --> 02:34:14,240
we were getting laid but we
could have gotten laid anywhere.

5057
02:34:14,270 --> 02:34:14,721
You know,

5058
02:34:14,721 --> 02:34:16,460
we could have gone to
a bar and gotten lay.

5059
02:34:16,461 --> 02:34:18,670
We did because

5060
02:34:19,390 --> 02:34:21,700
we wanted those other guys.

5061
02:34:21,701 --> 02:34:26,350
We wanted our buddies to love
our women so that if I die,

5062
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:30,490
I know these guys will take care of her
because they love her because they've

5063
02:34:30,491 --> 02:34:31,240
been with her.

5064
02:34:31,240 --> 02:34:32,200
They know her.

5065
02:34:32,201 --> 02:34:33,034
Right?

5066
02:34:33,380 --> 02:34:34,161
It's like it,

5067
02:34:34,161 --> 02:34:39,161
it moved me so much to read that because
a lot of the accounts from the Amazon

5068
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:41,373
are the same.

5069
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:43,690
These guys are facing a difficult life.

5070
02:34:43,980 --> 02:34:47,170
You can go hunting one
day and you get your,

5071
02:34:47,171 --> 02:34:47,840
the Hunty,

5072
02:34:47,840 --> 02:34:48,430
you know,

5073
02:34:48,430 --> 02:34:50,140
things can go wrong really fast,

5074
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:54,010
so you want people to love each other,

5075
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:57,430
not exclusively because then
they take care of each other,

5076
02:34:57,431 --> 02:34:58,840
they take care of each other's kids,

5077
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:00,670
they share their food,

5078
02:35:00,671 --> 02:35:00,851
they,

5079
02:35:00,851 --> 02:35:01,211
you know,

5080
02:35:01,211 --> 02:35:02,560
they look out for each other.

5081
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:05,200
And that's really the essence of humanity.

5082
02:35:05,460 --> 02:35:10,460
Have you explored the idea
that the opposite trend that
we are finding ourselves

5083
02:35:10,921 --> 02:35:15,921
in now where people are just gravitating
towards monogamy at least culturally,

5084
02:35:16,330 --> 02:35:17,310
at least on paper,

5085
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:18,391
that this,

5086
02:35:18,391 --> 02:35:18,601
uh,

5087
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:23,601
this move towards that ideal is because
we're safer is because we're more likely

5088
02:35:24,121 --> 02:35:24,901
to be protected.

5089
02:35:24,901 --> 02:35:25,770
We don't need these.

5090
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:30,360
We in sort of a natural inclination
to move towards a deeper bond with one

5091
02:35:30,361 --> 02:35:31,320
individual person.

5092
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:33,750
I don't know that I'd call
it a natural inclination,

5093
02:35:33,751 --> 02:35:34,501
but you know,

5094
02:35:34,501 --> 02:35:34,701
I,

5095
02:35:34,701 --> 02:35:39,300
I tend to see it more as a byproduct
of institutional and economic forces.

5096
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:41,400
I see that as also being natural.

5097
02:35:41,401 --> 02:35:46,080
And I know it sounds very contradictory
when I look at Wolf behavior.

5098
02:35:46,150 --> 02:35:46,460
Yeah,

5099
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:46,750
I,

5100
02:35:46,750 --> 02:35:51,750
I don't take our crazy fucked up weird
behavior and not think that it's natural.

5101
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:55,500
Even though there's consciousness
involve and choices involved,

5102
02:35:55,501 --> 02:35:58,020
there's something about the
pattern of human behavior.

5103
02:35:58,021 --> 02:35:59,070
When I look at it as a whole,

5104
02:35:59,071 --> 02:36:02,370
where I see it's kind of arrogant
to assume that this isn't natural.

5105
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:04,500
It seems that almost
everything is natural.

5106
02:36:04,501 --> 02:36:05,131
That's the thing.

5107
02:36:05,131 --> 02:36:06,240
It depends how you define.

5108
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:08,011
I mean you could,

5109
02:36:08,011 --> 02:36:08,960
if you take a real

5110
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:10,610
global perspective,

5111
02:36:10,611 --> 02:36:15,611
you could say as I tend to think of it
that we are not where the ants and the

5112
02:36:16,041 --> 02:36:21,041
ant hill and the ant hill is what's
evolving and that's the sort of the,

5113
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:22,430
the,

5114
02:36:22,430 --> 02:36:24,800
the location of the selection.

5115
02:36:25,130 --> 02:36:25,940
In other words,

5116
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:27,290
as individuals,

5117
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:30,170
we think we're what's evolving,

5118
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:33,890
but I think what's evolving
is society's corporations,

5119
02:36:33,891 --> 02:36:35,110
these institutions that,

5120
02:36:35,370 --> 02:36:39,380
that include us and they don't
give a shit if we're happy or not.

5121
02:36:39,690 --> 02:36:40,250
This,

5122
02:36:40,250 --> 02:36:41,980
this larger being that we're in or a

5123
02:36:41,990 --> 02:36:44,270
part of as we fuel them with electricity,

5124
02:36:44,271 --> 02:36:44,841
with commerce,

5125
02:36:44,841 --> 02:36:45,351
with whatever.

5126
02:36:45,351 --> 02:36:47,330
They literally act like a life form.

5127
02:36:47,331 --> 02:36:49,370
This is the same way as technology.

5128
02:36:49,371 --> 02:36:50,420
Like Marshall Mcluhan said,

5129
02:36:50,630 --> 02:36:51,920
we are the sexual organs.

5130
02:36:51,930 --> 02:36:53,030
Those machines,

5131
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:53,690
well,

5132
02:36:53,690 --> 02:36:55,150
as we fuel the,

5133
02:36:55,151 --> 02:36:55,310
the,

5134
02:36:55,310 --> 02:36:57,170
the desire for new laptops,

5135
02:36:57,171 --> 02:36:58,190
we keep that alive.

5136
02:36:58,460 --> 02:36:58,870
Right.

5137
02:36:58,870 --> 02:36:59,140
And,

5138
02:36:59,140 --> 02:36:59,751
and you know,

5139
02:36:59,751 --> 02:37:00,060
uh,

5140
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:02,930
when Mitt Romney said corporations
are people in my friend,

5141
02:37:02,931 --> 02:37:04,700
I don't think he was
thinking in these terms,

5142
02:37:05,300 --> 02:37:06,320
but they're not people,

5143
02:37:06,321 --> 02:37:07,460
but they're living beings,

5144
02:37:07,540 --> 02:37:09,110
they have a stake and staying alive.

5145
02:37:09,620 --> 02:37:12,650
They have a vested interest
and if step on us to do it,

5146
02:37:12,651 --> 02:37:13,170
they'll do it,

5147
02:37:13,170 --> 02:37:13,640
you know,

5148
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:14,510
fucking crazy is that.

5149
02:37:14,511 --> 02:37:16,070
And they can get to do it for them.

5150
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:16,963
Frankenstein,

5151
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:17,341
you know,

5152
02:37:17,341 --> 02:37:20,230
that was the whole Frankenstein
myth and it's happier,

5153
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:20,961
you know,

5154
02:37:20,961 --> 02:37:21,711
don't fear it.

5155
02:37:21,711 --> 02:37:24,480
Don't you know how in 2001 it's here,

5156
02:37:24,490 --> 02:37:24,750
it's,

5157
02:37:24,750 --> 02:37:26,570
it's been happening for quite awhile.

5158
02:37:26,750 --> 02:37:31,310
Monsanto doesn't give a shit if
they produce food that kills us.

5159
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:32,090
No,

5160
02:37:32,090 --> 02:37:33,860
as long as they've cornered the market,

5161
02:37:33,890 --> 02:37:35,990
well they also produce
DDT and Agent Orange.

5162
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:36,530
Sure.

5163
02:37:36,530 --> 02:37:37,840
So itself,

5164
02:37:39,220 --> 02:37:42,350
they've been making fucked
up choices for a long time.

5165
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:45,740
You know what I told that story
about the pilots in San Diego.

5166
02:37:45,741 --> 02:37:49,820
I was given a talk down there and this
guy came up to me after and he said,

5167
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:50,660
I'm a,

5168
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:51,280
I'm A.

5169
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,210
I was a fighter pilot in Vietnam.

5170
02:37:53,570 --> 02:37:54,320
Same thing.

5171
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:54,901
Different war,

5172
02:37:54,901 --> 02:37:55,550
same thing.

5173
02:37:55,550 --> 02:37:56,301
Wow.

5174
02:37:56,301 --> 02:37:58,160
So it's a natural behavior pattern.

5175
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:02,630
Apparently it's a culture
among fighter pilots that a,

5176
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:03,650
they.

5177
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:05,540
Well that they're facing death.

5178
02:38:05,560 --> 02:38:05,980
Right.

5179
02:38:05,980 --> 02:38:06,200
And,

5180
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:07,040
and I found it.

5181
02:38:07,041 --> 02:38:12,041
I'd done a lot of research and hospitals
and I found a very amplified sexuality

5182
02:38:12,651 --> 02:38:15,930
in hospitals center because
they're facing as well.

5183
02:38:16,040 --> 02:38:16,460
Cops.

5184
02:38:16,460 --> 02:38:16,721
Yeah,

5185
02:38:16,721 --> 02:38:17,320
sure.

5186
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:17,780
Yeah,

5187
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,111
sure.

5188
02:38:18,111 --> 02:38:20,870
Anybody who's on the edge and Hulk Hogan,

5189
02:38:22,640 --> 02:38:23,530
Hulk Hogan Swim.

5190
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,620
That MMA fighter.

5191
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:25,041
No,

5192
02:38:25,041 --> 02:38:25,401
he's not.

5193
02:38:25,401 --> 02:38:28,400
He's just interviewed at the airport
and just said something silly.

5194
02:38:28,820 --> 02:38:30,260
Everybody blew that out of proportion.

5195
02:38:30,980 --> 02:38:31,341
Yeah.

5196
02:38:31,341 --> 02:38:32,174
Hulk Hogan,

5197
02:38:32,370 --> 02:38:33,130
they used to.

5198
02:38:33,130 --> 02:38:34,070
He was a web swapper.

5199
02:38:34,900 --> 02:38:36,760
The AG guys,

5200
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:38,780
much of the.

5201
02:38:39,270 --> 02:38:41,940
Was it the New York jets
and the giants had Ryan.

5202
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:43,233
There was this.

5203
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:44,360
Did you hear about this?

5204
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:44,820
No,

5205
02:38:44,820 --> 02:38:46,370
this controversy because there were,

5206
02:38:46,400 --> 02:38:49,190
there were pictures on
the Internet of him,

5207
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:52,130
his wife and another dude,

5208
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,130
and the wife was like either naked or in
lingerie and the other dude was sucking

5209
02:38:57,140 --> 02:38:57,790
her toes.

5210
02:38:57,790 --> 02:38:58,623
Oh,

5211
02:38:58,650 --> 02:38:59,870
Jesus Christ.

5212
02:38:59,871 --> 02:39:01,340
That's where I checked out

5213
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:05,190
the glove.

5214
02:39:05,190 --> 02:39:05,931
Weird about that,

5215
02:39:05,931 --> 02:39:06,231
man.

5216
02:39:06,231 --> 02:39:07,400
We're real weird about that.

5217
02:39:07,430 --> 02:39:08,263
It's interesting.

5218
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:09,170
It's a,

5219
02:39:09,250 --> 02:39:09,491
it's,

5220
02:39:09,491 --> 02:39:12,790
it's fascinating to just see
the trends and how they've,

5221
02:39:12,910 --> 02:39:14,960
how they've changed with the environment.

5222
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:15,510
Yeah,

5223
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:18,870
and how different they are as you were
saying in cultures like there was a at

5224
02:39:18,890 --> 02:39:22,880
the same time that thing was happening
in the states and it was a huge to do.

5225
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:28,390
There was a soccer coach in England
who got nabbed coming out of a massage

5226
02:39:30,711 --> 02:39:35,711
parlor with happy endings and all that
and the press was there and snapping all

5227
02:39:37,131 --> 02:39:39,020
these pictures and they said,

5228
02:39:39,050 --> 02:39:40,090
do you know their tie?

5229
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:41,120
How hookers in there?

5230
02:39:41,121 --> 02:39:41,331
He said,

5231
02:39:41,331 --> 02:39:43,000
of course I know die yolkers in this,

5232
02:39:43,010 --> 02:39:43,141
why?

5233
02:39:43,141 --> 02:39:43,974
I go there.

5234
02:39:44,120 --> 02:39:45,050
And it was like,

5235
02:39:45,051 --> 02:39:45,350
what,

5236
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:46,940
how dare you not be ashamed,

5237
02:39:46,941 --> 02:39:47,181
you know?

5238
02:39:47,181 --> 02:39:50,390
And then they went and interviewed
his wife and his wife said,

5239
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:51,471
Oh God,

5240
02:39:51,471 --> 02:39:53,810
if I could get him to go to
Thai hookers twice a week,

5241
02:39:53,811 --> 02:39:54,740
I'd pay for it.

5242
02:39:54,741 --> 02:39:55,790
It relaxes him.

5243
02:39:55,791 --> 02:39:57,020
He's better at his job.

5244
02:39:57,021 --> 02:39:57,291
You know,

5245
02:39:57,291 --> 02:39:58,700
how is this any of your business?

5246
02:39:58,940 --> 02:40:01,250
Just completely trumped the,

5247
02:40:01,251 --> 02:40:01,540
the,

5248
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:01,790
you know,

5249
02:40:01,790 --> 02:40:02,120
the,

5250
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:05,300
the assumption that she'd be
ashamed and run away from it.

5251
02:40:05,301 --> 02:40:05,480
Like,

5252
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:05,661
Hey,

5253
02:40:05,661 --> 02:40:07,100
this is none of your damn business.

5254
02:40:07,490 --> 02:40:08,780
Sounds like you've got a good wife.

5255
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:09,980
Nailed it.

5256
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:11,600
Imagine if the Clintons had done that.

5257
02:40:12,290 --> 02:40:13,123
Maybe they did in,

5258
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:13,980
you

5259
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:14,161
know,

5260
02:40:14,161 --> 02:40:15,240
maybe you think they did.

5261
02:40:15,270 --> 02:40:18,000
Maybe Hillary was just mad that
he wasn't bringing checks home.

5262
02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:19,801
I mean,

5263
02:40:19,801 --> 02:40:20,634
who knows,

5264
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:24,480
who fucking cares either those businesses.

5265
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:25,120
Oh,

5266
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:30,120
it's just so weird how the desire for
sex and our appetite for sex is not

5267
02:40:30,931 --> 02:40:32,660
represented in any way.

5268
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:37,670
I mean it's represented a bit in the
media and film and advertising and stuff

5269
02:40:37,681 --> 02:40:37,981
like that,

5270
02:40:37,981 --> 02:40:38,814
but it's not.

5271
02:40:38,910 --> 02:40:39,743
Honestly,

5272
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:41,360
it's not honestly engaged.

5273
02:40:41,361 --> 02:40:42,750
It's not honestly described.

5274
02:40:42,750 --> 02:40:46,250
It's funny though because like I
saw this Carter or in a cartoon,

5275
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:51,270
a commercial a couple of weeks ago for
some plunger or some plumbing thing to

5276
02:40:51,991 --> 02:40:53,870
clear your drains and it,

5277
02:40:53,871 --> 02:40:54,160
the,

5278
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,230
the idea was,

5279
02:40:55,320 --> 02:40:55,800
and it was,

5280
02:40:55,800 --> 02:40:56,030
you know,

5281
02:40:56,030 --> 02:41:01,030
the whatever the major brand plumbing
thing is and this stuff has the chemical

5282
02:41:01,111 --> 02:41:01,681
nastiness,

5283
02:41:01,681 --> 02:41:05,610
but it also has like a plastic thing you
can stick down to pull the hair thing.

5284
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:07,830
And so it was like double action.

5285
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:08,550
Right?

5286
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:09,900
And so the ad was,

5287
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:13,410
this woman answers the door and
it's this really good looking dude,

5288
02:41:13,411 --> 02:41:14,011
and the dude's like,

5289
02:41:14,011 --> 02:41:14,161
yeah,

5290
02:41:14,161 --> 02:41:16,140
I'm here to snake your drain baby.

5291
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:16,951
And she says,

5292
02:41:16,951 --> 02:41:17,490
oh.

5293
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:18,031
And she's like,

5294
02:41:18,031 --> 02:41:18,811
all flustered in,

5295
02:41:18,811 --> 02:41:19,231
Oh yes,

5296
02:41:19,231 --> 02:41:19,920
come with me.

5297
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:21,980
And then someone else
knocks and she opened it.

5298
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:22,771
It's another dude.

5299
02:41:22,771 --> 02:41:23,131
And he's like,

5300
02:41:23,131 --> 02:41:23,401
yeah,

5301
02:41:23,401 --> 02:41:24,330
I'm here to help.

5302
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:25,553
Oh,

5303
02:41:25,590 --> 02:41:25,891
oh,

5304
02:41:25,891 --> 02:41:26,720
two of you.

5305
02:41:26,720 --> 02:41:27,120
Oh,

5306
02:41:27,120 --> 02:41:27,480
what?

5307
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:28,150
What country?

5308
02:41:28,150 --> 02:41:29,790
That's here in the states.

5309
02:41:30,060 --> 02:41:30,590
And I,

5310
02:41:30,590 --> 02:41:31,381
I linked to it.

5311
02:41:31,381 --> 02:41:31,441
I,

5312
02:41:31,441 --> 02:41:32,170
I tweeted,

5313
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:32,491
I said,

5314
02:41:32,491 --> 02:41:34,110
has this actually been on TV?

5315
02:41:34,111 --> 02:41:36,180
Because someone sent
me the link on Youtube.

5316
02:41:36,210 --> 02:41:36,511
I said,

5317
02:41:36,511 --> 02:41:37,830
has anyone seen this on TV?

5318
02:41:37,831 --> 02:41:38,610
And a bunch of people.

5319
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:39,010
Rebecca.

5320
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:39,451
Oh yeah.

5321
02:41:39,451 --> 02:41:40,320
I've seen it on TV.

5322
02:41:40,321 --> 02:41:41,154
It's on

5323
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:41,780
like,

5324
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:42,740
wow.

5325
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:44,121
Wow.

5326
02:41:44,121 --> 02:41:45,260
What's up with that?

5327
02:41:45,320 --> 02:41:45,531
Well,

5328
02:41:45,531 --> 02:41:46,490
congratulations,

5329
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:48,650
whoever company put that out.

5330
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:50,330
Graduations for sneaking that through.

5331
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:50,930
Can we?

5332
02:41:50,930 --> 02:41:51,741
Can we end on that?

5333
02:41:51,741 --> 02:41:52,770
Can we pull that out?

5334
02:41:52,880 --> 02:41:53,870
It's quite good.

5335
02:41:53,871 --> 02:41:54,180
It's,

5336
02:41:54,180 --> 02:41:54,600
it's,

5337
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:55,610
I think it's plunger,

5338
02:41:55,611 --> 02:42:00,150
dual action plunger or whatever that
somebody can find that to tool action

5339
02:42:00,390 --> 02:42:01,223
plunger.

5340
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:02,130
That's hilarious.

5341
02:42:02,130 --> 02:42:05,930
The woman's like in the grocery store
and she sees these two guys and has this

5342
02:42:05,931 --> 02:42:06,950
whole fantasy.

5343
02:42:07,440 --> 02:42:08,990
What's going on with that TV show that?

5344
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:10,131
Well,

5345
02:42:10,131 --> 02:42:10,641
it's great,

5346
02:42:10,641 --> 02:42:10,791
man.

5347
02:42:10,791 --> 02:42:13,100
Last time I was here I guess
we talked probably off the air,

5348
02:42:13,101 --> 02:42:13,620
but.

5349
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:18,280
But I'm like a whole shitload of
production companies want to do it.

5350
02:42:18,340 --> 02:42:20,290
Everybody thinks it's going to go.

5351
02:42:20,470 --> 02:42:21,190
Is this it?

5352
02:42:21,190 --> 02:42:22,023
Yeah.

5353
02:42:22,980 --> 02:42:23,813
Impact.

5354
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:27,940
Total impacts are.

5355
02:42:27,970 --> 02:42:28,803
So here's snake.

5356
02:42:28,840 --> 02:42:29,673
He's hot.

5357
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,290
He's hot too.

5358
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:38,220
I'm here to flush your pipe.

5359
02:42:46,330 --> 02:42:47,163
Wow.

5360
02:42:47,170 --> 02:42:51,000
She's letting her hair down and everything
while he's going to go upstairs and

5361
02:42:51,001 --> 02:42:52,470
there's just nothing but shit.

5362
02:42:54,150 --> 02:42:56,650
She takes these massive logging or poop.

5363
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:58,830
He's fucking wood chips.

5364
02:42:59,900 --> 02:43:02,520
It's just not blood.

5365
02:43:02,780 --> 02:43:03,613
The very.

5366
02:43:05,640 --> 02:43:06,550
And She just woke up.

5367
02:43:06,910 --> 02:43:07,743
That's her.

5368
02:43:08,050 --> 02:43:08,920
That's her fantasy.

5369
02:43:09,250 --> 02:43:09,461
Yeah.

5370
02:43:09,461 --> 02:43:11,800
The under sex housewife shits reality

5371
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:13,510
and the gay guy holding the fruit.

5372
02:43:13,650 --> 02:43:16,270
The Gay guy working with the melons.

5373
02:43:16,740 --> 02:43:17,850
The two of them are just gonna.

5374
02:43:17,870 --> 02:43:19,720
Use her as an excuse to get together.

5375
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:21,603
That's how they're doing.

5376
02:43:21,790 --> 02:43:24,250
That's what double
penetration is when two guys,

5377
02:43:24,370 --> 02:43:26,140
when they're both in the
vagina at the same time,

5378
02:43:26,410 --> 02:43:28,030
they're just using the
woman as a container.

5379
02:43:28,031 --> 02:43:28,930
So they could rub dicks.

5380
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:29,310
Com.

5381
02:43:29,310 --> 02:43:29,740
Scrotum,

5382
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:30,131
buddies.

5383
02:43:30,131 --> 02:43:30,371
Yeah,

5384
02:43:30,371 --> 02:43:31,204
that's what they're doing.

5385
02:43:31,900 --> 02:43:32,320
Listen,

5386
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:33,250
a fascinating.

5387
02:43:33,251 --> 02:43:33,611
Again,

5388
02:43:33,611 --> 02:43:34,870
three hours just flew right by.

5389
02:43:34,880 --> 02:43:35,290
Matt.

5390
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:36,160
We could do this every time.

5391
02:43:36,161 --> 02:43:39,240
We still talked about like one
paragraph and your book will come.

5392
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:39,971
We'll cover it.

5393
02:43:39,971 --> 02:43:40,804
One page,

Came out to Nashville this weekend.

5430
02:44:27,881 --> 02:44:29,440
We had a great fucking time.

5431
02:44:29,441 --> 02:44:30,490
Nashville was awesome.

5432
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:32,440
I was exactly what I needed.

5433
02:44:32,730 --> 02:44:35,940
Wanted to go to a small club in a workout,

5434
02:44:35,950 --> 02:44:36,783
some new material.

5435
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:37,953
And Man,

5436
02:44:38,050 --> 02:44:39,940
there's nothing like
working at a comedy club.

5437
02:44:39,941 --> 02:44:41,350
I've been doing a lot of theaters lately.

5438
02:44:41,351 --> 02:44:43,480
I forgot how much fun
it is to do a weekend,

5439
02:44:43,600 --> 02:44:45,040
like a 300 seater.

5440
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:47,020
Nashville is awesome.

5441
02:44:47,021 --> 02:44:48,700

bonds was with me as well.
