1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,590
Some cool Bosco,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,550
Gino and aj from La speed weed.
You a la live.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,650
Are you tweeting?
Joe just recorded a jingle for us.

4
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:18,490
So that's your jingle.
New Ringtone.

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,560
Um,
first of all,

6
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:24,620
Gina has been my friend for a long time
and he's basically a,

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,150
he's the guy that turned me onto this
whole la marijuana delivery scene that

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,570
is going on in La,
which was amazing for Comedians and for

9
00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:41,440
anybody who has a medical card where you
could just call this cool dude and he

10
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,380
would tell you what the great stuff is
and you hang out with them and talk with

11
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,110
them and you could buy it and there's
all totally legal and above board.

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,030
It was all good.
But somewhere along the line some

13
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,550
fuckery ran afoot.
They,

14
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,980
uh,
they came up with some new political

15
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,190
rules that keep marijuana delivery
services from operating busy.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,150
Keep explaining it because essentially
the way they've set it up,

17
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,570
it's like you would have to have had a
license to operate in each one of the

18
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:09,700
houses that you're delivering to.
Is that how it works?

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,280
Well,
it used to be called the wild west.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,520
You know,
out here in California for medical

21
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:17,920
marijuana,
um,

22
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,380
and it,
it very much was until they wanted to

23
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:26,381
regulate it and most of the people
wanted it regulated because they wanted

24
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,370
marijuana.
So yes,

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,690
let's take,
let's have marijuana.

26
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,740
Yes,
let's regulate it.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,100
However it will hold on.
People think that marijuana is legal in

28
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:35,240
California,
but it is,

29
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,890
it is not.
Absolutely not.

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,020
What we have is protection from
prosecution.

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,810
That's what we have,
which means that law enforcement can

32
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,000
knock your door down,
take your stuff,

33
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,500
take your,
we'd take your cash,

34
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:48,380
take whatever you got there,
and you can show them all the papers in

35
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,610
the world and they're like,
that's great.

36
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,960
That's cool.
We're glad you're legal.

37
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,530
Bring it to the judge and you'll be good
to go and you'll get your stuff back in

38
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,110
a year and you guys will be fine.
And that's happened to us.

39
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:57,890
So.

40
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,470
But do you get your stuff back?
Because I've heard there's a lot of

41
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,210
people that have never gotten their
sleep,

42
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,530
but we always have.
We.

43
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:05,240
So how long have they kept your stuff
for?

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,530
A little over a year.
Year.

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,130
So if you have,
if you have weed over a year,

46
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,960
they're not,
they're not taking care of it.

47
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,330
It's done a weeds.
Useless.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,300
It's useless.
So you lose how much money that cost

49
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,131
like that.
Well,

50
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:22,880
you don't have to set it a substantial
amount of money of course.

51
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,850
And so they give you the cash back,

52
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,370
they'll give it.
They can actually cut you a check.

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,460
Yes.
Check for the cash from the district

54
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,530
attorney's office.
Um,

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,800
I have one,
uh,

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,890
hanging on his wall in his office of
them returning thousands,

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,750
a few thousand dollars to us,
which,

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,660
because again,
when there was any sort of trouble,

59
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,210
it was all right,
you have to go see a judge,

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,520
you go see the judge and the judge looks
at the paperwork.

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,030
And in our first case,
the judge said,

62
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,420
we've never seen a more compliant
company in California and dismissed

63
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,010
without

64
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,320
prejudice.
And our lawyer asked,

65
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,250
instead of dismissing without prejudice,
we actually would like that entered in

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,670
to the record that you're calling la
speed.

67
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,900
We the most compliant marijuana company
you've ever,

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,880
ever dealt with.
So we had an entered into,

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,090
into um,
into the record.

70
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,990
Didn't translate though it didn't you
guy have a lawsuit on my desk that I'm

71
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,700
holding my hands 18 inches apart by the
way,

72
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,460
that is that high,
just lawsuit from the city.

73
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,440
It's just super unfortunate because it's
obviously not the will of the people,

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,510
you know,
whenever something is not the will of

75
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,450
the people I could see it's clear by all
the gentlemen in this room,

76
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,420
we're all grown adults and we all enjoy
marijuana.

77
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,050
We all have responsible lives,
we all do stuff,

78
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,530
we all get things done and we all enjoy
it and we're taxpayer.

79
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,860
So we're normal people.
We're not freaks.

80
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,340
We're not like Ne'er do wells or someone
who's clinging off the system and,

81
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:54,720
and fucking up,
you know,

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
a social systems that we've set up for
people that are trying to get by in this

83
00:04:00,511 --> 00:04:01,344
world.
No,

84
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,230
we're just guys.
And let's talk about what you said just

85
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:10,231
before the will of the people when they
voted on this,

86
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,150
this proposition d,
which is a zoning law.

87
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,970
Hold on.
Have any of you guys even ever heard of

88
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,450
Zoning Ordinance Measure d?
Has anyone heard of that?

89
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,410
That's.
No,

90
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,850
of course not.
Of course not.

91
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
Has anyone heard of it,
but hold on.

92
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,130
We haven't heard of any zoning.
Nobody does.

93
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,440
That's the thing is nobody pays
attention to zoning laws,

94
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,440
so now speed,
weed and services like ours that are

95
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,320
doing things the right way are closed
and in the city,

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,280
because of the zoning ordinance that was
passed because all these pot shops are

97
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,810
opening up,
so they said they're opening near

98
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,330
schools and churches got to protect the
children.

99
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,290
Got Every hilarious that opening them
near churches is an issue.

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,710
It shouldn't be politics in church and
state.

101
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,670
It's politics.

102
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,500
They.
They say that during the old days of the

103
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,010
Catholic church,
when they would walk down the aisle with

104
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,600
that incense thing,
they will be burning marijuana.

105
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,190
That's what they would be burning and
there'll be wafting it through the room

106
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,870
as they walk by your mountain.
You know those things,

107
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,630
they get around those things,
had weed in them.

108
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,250
There's a pamphlet online about them.
I want to end up.

109
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,480
Might not be true,
but it seems like it's not sure.

110
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,040
Let's just run with it.
Like Jamie,

111
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,850
genesis 1:47.
That's probably one of them.

112
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,900
Todd mccord.
I'm in quotes,

113
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,970
but probably told me that and I'm like,
oh,

114
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:23,990
that's a fact.
For sure.

115
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,330
I'm not even going to bother looking
that up.

116
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,690
It sounds so good,
but certainly cannabis has been part of

117
00:05:29,691 --> 00:05:34,691
the human record since the beginning.
It's a bizarre time we live in and it's

118
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,190
a long,
complicated explanation.

119
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,290
If someone who's never heard it before,
it's like,

120
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,490
well,
how did it get illegal?

121
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,180
Most of it got illegal because of
William Randolph hearst,

122
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,050
which is bananas that here we are in
2016 and this fucking crazy man from the

123
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:58,370
19 thirties who's running all these
running

124
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,660
everything and the the man that citizen
Kanes based on the Western welles movie,

125
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,930
he was just a maniac and he decided to
get marijuana eat to make it illegal so

126
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,760
that hemp would be illegal.
Correct?

127
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,180
Yeah.
The tax papers,

128
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,860
timber industry,
and it is insane that the propaganda

129
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,810
that this guy created,
the 19 thirties,

130
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,030
even though we recognize that everyone
knows it,

131
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,440
it's a fact.
You can watch it.

132
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,160
You can watch reefer madness.
You can see what's written down,

133
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,320
what they were they were attempting to
do to make it illegal.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,900
The fact that it still sticks in 2016
and you couldn't smoke that stuff that

135
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,530
they,
that they had any.

136
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,383
No,
no.

137
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,650
It's not psychoactive.
Well,

138
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,020
that is the craziest part.
Like we added on it.

139
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,930
We sell him,
but we have to buy it from Canada.

140
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,630
Yes.
Buy It from Canada and bring it down to

141
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,270
the United States because even though
it's legal and it's not psychoactive,

142
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,600
these farmers can't grow it major.

143
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,530
They're starting to try to change those
laws,

144
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,960
but as far as I know,
I mean I don't know of any large scale

145
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,480
hemp growing operations here in the
United States.

146
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:01,160
Not yet.
Not yet dangerous.

147
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,980
Like China's just dedicated millions of
acres.

148
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,620
You're on your own.
You will have to worry about your own

149
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:10,190
government when you're growing a plant
that you make clothes out of.

150
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,110
You make paper.
That's all they're doing with it.

151
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,700
Like,
let's be really clear on that,

152
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,900
that the Hamptons,
they're growing.

153
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,770
He can't get high off of it.
It's totally non psychoactive.

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Yet it's federally illegal.
There's a fucking plant that makes the

155
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,780
best clothes.
It makes way stronger fabric,

156
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,000
way stronger paper.
You can eat it.

157
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,990
It has all the essential amino acids.
It's like a full complete amino acid

158
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:35,240
profile.
It's one of the very few plans that's

159
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:37,040
like that.
You can make bio fuel out of it.

160
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,670
You can make fucking livestock.
Could you look at old ironsides,

161
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:42,530
the USS Constitution,
the flag,

162
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:43,030
and,
and the,

163
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,200
and the sales are made of hemp and there
are still.

164
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,900
Those are the original things for
hundreds of years ago.

165
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,170
One of the best things that nature has
ever created.

166
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,410
This fucking fiber.
It has this incredibly powerful fiber.

167
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,240
Like who the fuck was at?
One of my friends has an actual hemp

168
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,130
stalk.
And uh,

169
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,050
I was over his house and I picked it up
and I was like,

170
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,750
Whoa,
this is like a fucking alien plant

171
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,440
because it's hard as a hardwood tensile
strength.

172
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,020
The stronger than steel when it's wound.
Yeah.

173
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,680
So it feels hard like oak,
but it's light like Balsa Wood.

174
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,330
Yeah,
it's really weird.

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,770
You can make spaceships out of this
shit.

176
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,700
It feels like it's light and strong and
we're not using it because it's illegal.

177
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,470
It's fucking crazy.
Crazy.

178
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,870
Parachutes used to be made out of it.
Uh,

179
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,580
I know George Bush senior jumped out of
a plane in a with a hemp parachute,

180
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,560
you know,
so.

181
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,590
So all canvases,
all canvases.

182
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,040
The Mona Lisa was painted on,
cannabis was unhappy.

183
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,960
Our founding fathers had hempfields in
their farms because the head cleans the

184
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,590
fallow fields after wheat fucks up your
fields and corn fucks up your fields.

185
00:08:48,591 --> 00:08:49,940
Hip goes in there,
cleans it all out.

186
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,170
It's.
So,

187
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,400
it's such an identifier of how goofy
people are here in 2016,

188
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
that that's an issue that we're dealing
with this weird hemp thing because it's

189
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,700
related to marijuana.
Does anyone hear this though?

190
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:07,170
I mean,
did people really with,

191
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,620
with trump and hillary and Bernie,
do people really care that they do?

192
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,560
They don't know.
I don't know.

193
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,930
Most people have no idea.
Most people think there's some health

194
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,380
related risks and that's the reason why
it was made illegal.

195
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,990
That's why we're.
It's so for such a frustrating time for

196
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,260
us because we start talking about Zoning
Ordinance d and people are like,

197
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,300
I'm so bored.
Can't we just get baked?

198
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,920
What do you mean you're out of business?
Well,

199
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,690
don't you feel like.
How long have you guys been in the

200
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,970
business?
About six years.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,910
Six years.
How much has changed in six years?

202
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,440
So much since I've had a card.
I got my card in.

203
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,130
It was the nineties,
the nineties,

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,180
so there is one.
It was just one state here.

205
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,960
When we got in the business there was
about five states that are legal now

206
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:56,250
there's 24 in Florida is going to go.
That's going to be 25 plus DC.

207
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,980
It's half the country.
That's crazy.

208
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,040
And CBD is at.
If you conclude cbd,

209
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,350
there's only like seven or eight states
that are not participating,

210
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,750
like seven or eight states.
I guess now I'm thinking about it.

211
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:11,010
I guess it was more like 2001.
It's still way early,

212
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,440
but my,
my point was going to be that it's way

213
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,930
more relaxed now.
It's way more prevalent.

214
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,650
I used to have to go to Inglewood.
I go to Inglewood wellness center is

215
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,840
one of the gentleman that worked there.
Got Shot and that's when I stopped

216
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,810
going.
But that's how it was when we started,

217
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,930
right when we started,
how it wasn't much of a smoker when I

218
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,310
moved out here to California.
Um,

219
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,620
and uh,
you know,

220
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:36,540
he kinda sending,
now you're being condescending.

221
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,520
You guys fucking with each other.
Right?

222
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,830
So,
so,

223
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,223
you know,
uh,

224
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,310
we were working in technology for the
government before we started speed.

225
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,770
We together because your CIA and
infiltrated,

226
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,030
you know,
um,

227
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,560
don't put me in sturgeon Simpson's
category.

228
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,900
Let me tell you this story.
Real Cook,

229
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,820
sturgill Simpson was onstage and some
dude yells out in the audience,

230
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,060
sturge will please tell me not really a
CIA assassin.

231
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,460
And he just shrugged and went on the
next side.

232
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,720
Wheeler Walker Jr.
How funny is that dude?

233
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,360
Oh my god,
he's hilarious.

234
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,410
So,
so Ha was um,

235
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,650
uh,
we were working in a stressful

236
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:24,780
environment working for congress,
uh,

237
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,160
uh,
at the time.

238
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,900
And he was actually drinking to medicate
himself as we were,

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,830
you know,
working,

240
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,710
doing technology,
coding and things like that.

241
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,030
And he started playing with a new world
tropics to say,

242
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,410
you know what?
I'm not going to drink anymore.

243
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,330
And I said,
instead of new world tropics,

244
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,980
why don't you try cannabis?
YOu know what?

245
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,760
I was that guy who had the shelves of
modafinil and annual paps and all and

246
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,470
you're healthy and all these different
crazy thinGs that you can get on off the

247
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,220
market.

248
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,570
And gina was like,
just smoke this.

249
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,770
Just put all that shit away.
Put the booze away and just smoke this.

250
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:59,261
I'm like,
no,

251
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,760
it's going to make me freak out.
Well,

252
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:05,761
one thing that nootropics do help,
it helps me to maintain memory while

253
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,420
under the influence because it's one of
the most slippery things while being

254
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,600
under the influence of pot as the memory
is,

255
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,050
the memory gets real slippery.
Sure.

256
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:17,580
Yeah.
I think I gave him mouth the brain also.

257
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,180
Uh,
when we first first started.

258
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,140
Yeah.
That'll help.

259
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,160
Some people say that nicotine actually
helps in some strange way.

260
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,770
I use nicotine everyday.
Your nicorette.

261
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:29,050
I've never smoked it.
He started,

262
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,600
he started chewing the nicotine gum,
you know,

263
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:32,550
a few years ago.
And I said,

264
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,000
so you're on the ball.
I love it.

265
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,620
Yeah.
Well this is what it is.

266
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,660
Like nicotine itself apparently has a
similar effects to a lot of nootropics

267
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,190
and that it does something to stimulate
your brain function,

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,490
but smoking is fucking horrible for you.

269
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,240
So like,
it's not really the getting of the

270
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,220
nicotine,
which is so confusing because you

271
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,330
automatically assume nicotine equals
lung cancer.

272
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,980
Everybody dies.
That's so sad.

273
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,510
why do they do it?
And then you,

274
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,830
why are you doing nicotine?
And they go,

275
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:05,440
no,
it's the smoking of these chemicals

276
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:07,570
that's fucking up your lungs.
And it's giving you cancer,

277
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,510
it's irritating your lungs.
You know when people cough,

278
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,990
it's harsh.
Fucks your lungs up,

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,850
you get cancer,
you die.

280
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,100
That's what's going on.
it's not the nicotine's fault.

281
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,963
No,
it's not.

282
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,900
So nicotine itself is some sort of a
very strange compound that sort of like

283
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,560
stimulates your mind a little bit.
Yeah.

284
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,330
I think it's the drug that just knows,
like if you're wired,

285
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:27,970
it relaxes you.
If you're a little bit cloudy headed,

286
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,820
it gives you a boost of energy to it.
It sounds like it's in your veins,

287
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
your.
That's your friend.

288
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,940
The drug.
Who knows?

289
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:34,774
man,
who

290
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,300
knows?
A boy has no name the gum.

291
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,490
It's so gross.
I love it,

292
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,130
man.
Look at you.

293
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,750
The drug that knows.
That's hilarious.

294
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,210
The four milligram coated for flavor
from target.

295
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,280
Oh brother.

296
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,720
I was.
I wanted,

297
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,940
I wanted to do what I could to try and
help help this situation.

298
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,260
It wasn't,
didn't really need to be helped that

299
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:58,190
much,
but I said,

300
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,390
look,
you should just try,

301
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,100
try marijuana.
Um,

302
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,310
it's,
it's what regulates my mood and has

303
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,360
since I was.
I've been smoking almost daily since 15

304
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:09,740
years old.
Um,

305
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,420
and uh,
so I,

306
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,320
so I said,
let's,

307
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,850
let's,
let's go to the doctor.

308
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,010
And uh,
and he didn't want to go to the doCtor

309
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:16,500
with me.

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,490
no,
no,

311
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,220
because this is back in the early days
when everything was sketchy.

312
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,700
So we go to this office building that is
up in san fernando and there's barbed

313
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,630
wire around the building.
We go into sketchy office building and

314
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:28,970
I'm,
I'm freaking out the whole time,

315
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:30,000
you know,
our dad's a cop,

316
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,040
you know,
we've got clearance from the government

317
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,110
of what do we,
this is crazy and chinos is just like,

318
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,280
chill,
we're fine,

319
00:14:35,281 --> 00:14:35,731
you know,
cheer,

320
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:36,564
nicotine,
let's go.

321
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,160
And we go into this office,
this doctor's office,

322
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,270
clearly not a doctor's office.
And they say,

323
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,610
you know,
the doctor will see you both now and now

324
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm freaking out thinking like what?
I have to get undressed in front of my

325
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,730
brother and sit on the paper with this
doctor.

326
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,010
I don't whAt I'm doing.

327
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,270
And we just go into a room and there's a
table and he sits across from us and he

328
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,950
asked me first.
Unfortunately,

329
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,400
what you need weed,
and I said,

330
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,820
you know,
and I'm staring at him,

331
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,380
my brothers look at me and I could feel
him going,

332
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:05,090
don't fuck this up,
like don't fuck this up.

333
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,201
So he's like,
oh,

334
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:07,190
you have stress?
I said,

335
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,870
yes,
you have terrible sleep.

336
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:09,704
I said,
yes.

337
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,700
It says okay,
you have weed.

338
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,630
And he called it,
we'd,

339
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,030
he called it wheat and then he goes to
my brother,

340
00:15:14,031 --> 00:15:15,530
why do you need we eat?
And my brother goes,

341
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,720
I have stress and trouble sleep.
He the okay you have weed.

342
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,080
And we got these papers and it felt so
sketchy,

343
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,430
but we went to a dispensary that
afternoon and it's like those early

344
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:29,360
people that started to open dispensary's
like the inglewood wellness center.

345
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,730
Those people who like the pioneers in
the wild,

346
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,030
wild west.
That is a gangster moved.

347
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,010
Well,
it took some of the criminal element to

348
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,510
be in business at that point and that's
why going back to these laws that say

349
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:46,511
you had to be in business before 2007 in
order to even be considered in these few

350
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,020
that are allowed.
Well let's explain.

351
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,840
Let's explain the whole zoning thing.
So the issue is delivery,

352
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,550
right?
That's where the issue is.

353
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,290
So prop the is what governs all of las
marijuana laws.

354
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,840
That's a zoning law.
Um,

355
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,350
so there's 135 shops that are allowed.
Those are the ones that have been

356
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:10,910
operating since 2007.
They're called pre ico is any other shop

357
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:14,660
you go to is illegal.
Any delivery service you use in the city

358
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,480
of la is illegal according to
proposition d,

359
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,280
which we are fighting in court by the
way.

360
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,750
We are fighting that and that law just
came out in,

361
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,250
in uh,
2012,

362
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,600
2013,
2014.

363
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,910
So we had,
we hadn't been in business for years.

364
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,200
We had already been working with the
state government for years on,

365
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,280
on the process of legalization.
we advise the state assembly were the

366
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,220
only retail company on the,
on the board of equalization stakeholder

367
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:43,810
panel.
I know,

368
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,020
I know I'm in the weeds right now,
but like we are the company that instead

369
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:49,310
of suing us,
you should have just said,

370
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,050
hey guys,
what's a good way to do this?

371
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,880
You know,
that that's important to talk about

372
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,970
that,
you know,

373
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,080
the board of equalization is kind of
like the irs for the state.

374
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,110
If you're a commercial business,
you pay your taxes to the board of

375
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,430
equalization.
Well,

376
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,580
the board of equalization chose our
company as the one retail company that

377
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,590
they wanted to present to the
legislature,

378
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,720
to,
to the people with,

379
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,040
um,
with we presented with the New York

380
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,160
state.
Uh,

381
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,790
I mean,
uh,

382
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:19,040
the California state troopers,
uh,

383
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,830
the highway patrol,
the teamsters insurance company,

384
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:25,610
and an app company and us.
Can I just say the board of equalization

385
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,320
that,
that name,

386
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,010
it sounds like some sort of an overseer
in a woody allen movie,

387
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:35,450
but the future they kind of are the
board of equalization that some like

388
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,960
fucking utopian nightmare mirror the
right theory.

389
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,410
How are you?
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor

390
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,060
and not good enough white man.
See any business owner.

391
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,720
Here's board of equalization and they're
freaking like,

392
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,540
they're laughing,
they're laughing,

393
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,120
but they're also afraid.
What is equalization mean?

394
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,120
It would be a word that seems like they
made that word up.

395
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,970
Now that I think of it,
that's kind of fucked up that it's

396
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:02,510
called equalization.
Like we're going to take the businesses

397
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,820
money and give it to y'all here so we
can all get equalized.

398
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,490
That doesn't,
that doesn't work.

399
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,721
No,
it doesn't.

400
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,100
It.
Some people are lazy.

401
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,770
It doesn't work.
This has got to be a way though.

402
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:19,030
They think that a universal basic income
that giving people $13,000 though,

403
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,040
like giving everybody through some.
Michael shermer actually just tweeted

404
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,710
this,
who's the really intelligent skeptic

405
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,720
guy,
um,

406
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,850
and they think giving people $13,000 a
year,

407
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:32,460
like giving it to everybody would reduce
crime,

408
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,720
would reduce poverty.
It would give people chAnces to pursue

409
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,960
other things if they had the universal
basic income.

410
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,530
It's a really strange concept because
it's one of those things that everybody

411
00:18:43,531 --> 00:18:44,640
has an ego reaction to.

412
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
I definitely did.
I heard it and I was like,

413
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,540
get outta here.
You can't just give people money.

414
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:52,470
People are too lazy.
But the more I read about it and the

415
00:18:52,471 --> 00:18:57,471
more I see people who are quite a bit
more educated than me on this subject,

416
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,380
they think that it's possible that doing
something like that would actually cost

417
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:06,381
less money in the long run because it
would start a cascade of positive events

418
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,650
that giving people enough money to get
by on right.

419
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,430
That,
that would start like a series of events

420
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,560
in a lot of these people's lives were
issues,

421
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:19,320
would be taken care of,
that are insurmountable.

422
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:23,760
Otherwise it'll start some momentum in a
positive way and that you're going to

423
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,640
deal with less crime and you're going to
deal with less of violence.

424
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:30,750
So you're going to deal with less need
to deal with the problems and the

425
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,270
financial repercussions of crime and
violence.

426
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,090
It'll overall cost less money to the
community.

427
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm skeptical though.
My knee,

428
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,630
my knee jerked.
Yeah.

429
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,140
When I did mine did too.
And I was first talking about it with my

430
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,840
friend eddie wong from a vice from that
vice show.

431
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,630
What's his fucking chose in world or
something?

432
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
Is that what it is?
Um,

433
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,740
but he brought It up and I was like,
why get the fuck out of here?

434
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,660
And then when I realized that there were
a lot of people bringing this up,

435
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,291
I said,
okay,

436
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,330
well let me,
let me put my knee down

437
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,270
with dj,
let's put,

438
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,850
let me just open mindedly look at this.
And I'm like,

439
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,690
oh,
okay.

440
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,660
I'm looking at,
in the port,

441
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,120
like if you give people money,
they're just going to be lazy and then

442
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,640
everything going to get anything done
and you're going to deal with a bunch of

443
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:18,474
lazy people.

444
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,570
Plateau effect,
right?

445
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,310
So like the worst fears that people have
when they're worried about welfare,

446
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,730
that you create a welfare environment
where people get accustomed to that and

447
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,920
they have no ambition and nothing ever
gets done.

448
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:32,220
It's Almost a way to poison people's
ambition is to give them money.

449
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:36,810
Like Switzerland just had thIs thing
where they were going to give everybody,

450
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,580
I think it was like $2,500 a month,
just like free income.

451
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,410
And then hope that that would pay for
everyone to be like a,

452
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,990
just a little bump.
So they would keep their jobs and stuff

453
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,150
like that and they're like,
they're shitty jobs would feel a little

454
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,880
bit better,
but theN they,

455
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,080
uh,
they denied it and yeah,

456
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,180
it didn't pass.
But that would be interesting.

457
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,250
Everybody getting free income.
Well yeah,

458
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,810
that's the idea behind this and
Switzerland is a very inclusive country

459
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,990
where everyone serves in the military
and has To participate.

460
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:11,590
That would be a good place to try
something like this because America is

461
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,470
obviously a little bit more loosey
goosey with that kind of shit.

462
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,650
We gotta spread that we had dollar
bills.

463
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,660
Y'all.
How much,

464
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,000
how big is Switzerland?
Like how many people live there?

465
00:21:22,001 --> 00:21:24,190
I mean that's,
that would be like given universal basic

466
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:26,410
income to la,
you know,

467
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,180
really that,
I mean those are the arguments for like

468
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
universal healthcare and all that.
Well it works in Finland.

469
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,660
Well Finland is like the size of long
island and westchester county one.

470
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,150
I mean just think about like the stuff
that flies in Canada,

471
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,820
right?
You know,

472
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,280
Canada has a totally different country.
They're connected to us but they're

473
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,310
fucking completely different and they're
right there.

474
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:50,980
So if anybody says it works for Canada,
like there's only $30,

475
00:21:50,981 --> 00:21:54,940
million of that's right.
Have a huge fucking country and there's

476
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:57,730
only 30 million people and they're just
nicer.

477
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,070
They are.
You just nice if there's a canadian that

478
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:00,681
room,
you told it,

479
00:22:00,681 --> 00:22:02,170
you know it immediately.
They're nice.

480
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,050
They're like some of the nicest fucking
human beings on the planet.

481
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,420
It's a one country that I wouldn't think
twice.

482
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,130
I wouldn't think twice about moving to
Canada.

483
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,810
Well,
they're ahead of the curve on cannabis

484
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,820
for sure.
Oh yeah,

485
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
yeah,
yeah.

486
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,830
Delivery is the only option in Canada,
right?

487
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,690
And it's government sanctioned.
Yeah.

488
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,230
The government is essentially this new
guy that has gotten in.

489
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,790
What's the new guy's name?
I'm the young guy.

490
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,230
The handsome fella.

491
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,680
I gotta think of the guy from dunes
burdens.

492
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,450
The government is also behind their
alcohol sales also in,

493
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:35,680
in Canada.
Like you can't buy liquor unless it's

494
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:40,681
through the government,
but I'm not as a drug dealer in Canada,

495
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,040
Canada.
I kinda,

496
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,130
I,
I'm very,

497
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,120
I'm very libertarian so I don't like the
government involved wherever possible.

498
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,030
Yeah.
That's some interesting rulings about

499
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,420
comedy up there too.
There was,

500
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,870
there was one guy that got heckled by
some women in a nightclub in vancouver

501
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,100
and apparently they were really drunk
and you know,

502
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,290
things happen in comedy clubs.
People get crazy,

503
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,060
they yell things out,
you're serving people drinks,

504
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:08,830
they're going to get crazy.
They're gonna yell things out.

505
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,670
So he was yelling things at them and he
said a bunch of rude stuff about them

506
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:16,270
being lesbians,
but you're homophobic stuff and they

507
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:21,271
suit them and they won $15,000,
$15,000 going down his men would it once

508
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:28,420
people start hurling insults at each
other,

509
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:31,300
like the women hurled insults at the
comedian,

510
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,430
the comedian hurled insults at the
woman.

511
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,850
I don't know who started it off.
I think that would be imperative to find

512
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,890
out who started it off.
But,

513
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,770
um,
I know that the guy was on stage doing

514
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:45,320
stand up.
So they're not supposed to be yelling.

515
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:48,260
This isn't a conversation.
If they're talking to him,

516
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,520
I guarantee you,
unless he's a crowd worker,

517
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,380
I don't know if he does.
He's a guy that works crowds,

518
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,320
but I guarantee you most likely he was
getting interrupted.

519
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:00,050
So he's trying to do is act for all the
people in the room who's was getting

520
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:02,700
interrupted and then it got ugly.
Right?

521
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,080
And what's the answer to have people
sIgned waivers before they walk in the

522
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:07,570
comedy clubs.
It's silly.

523
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,530
It's just you can't.
You can't

524
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,820
have a monetary reward for someone that
heckled.

525
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,500
You shouldn't be able to extract money.
A comedy club like that because you go

526
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,880
in trying to make it happen.

527
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,750
Because I go,
look,

528
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,030
you go to a baseball game,
you get hit with a foul ball,

529
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,770
you die.
You can't sue anybody because it's kind

530
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:31,510
of a given.
That dangerous shit is flying around.

531
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,830
Balls are fast and hard.
Fuck baseball.

532
00:24:33,831 --> 00:24:38,831
I didn't know that could happen,
but if you go to a comedy club comedy

533
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,850
club,
first rule is you're in the audience.

534
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:44,060
Shut the fuck up.
Second rule is let the comics say what

535
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:45,500
he wants to say and you might get
offended.

536
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,210
That's the chance you take going in
there.

537
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,220
Yeah,
I mean I don't want to stand up for the

538
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:52,430
headquarters in any way,
but the only way that it could be

539
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:56,300
different is if it's like rick ingram
works at crowd constantly,

540
00:24:56,301 --> 00:24:58,430
you know,
talks to people and if you have thin

541
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,200
skin,
he's hilarious.

542
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,750
But if you have a thin skin he'll fuck
with you,

543
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,120
you know,
and Maybe you didn't want that.

544
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,940
And so maybe you insult back and you
know,

545
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,300
rick knows how to handle stuff like
that,

546
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,580
but I'm saying if he's one of those
kinds of comedians that,

547
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,320
that works a crowd,
that's cool,

548
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,540
you know,
but it could have been that he insulted

549
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:17,300
them first.
It's the only time that I could see

550
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,360
where they would get pissed off.
From what I understand,

551
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,000
they had been heckling all night.
That was according to his version of the

552
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:25,490
story,
which it's not like people wait to

553
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,500
hackle you know,
someone who's a heckler.

554
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,140
If there's four comedians and then the
night and the fourth guy goes up,

555
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,940
that person's probably been tackling all
night.

556
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Right now they're just drunk.
Or does it scare you though?

557
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,060
like,
like doing material in Canada in the

558
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:40,130
future,
if it gets heated with like you and a

559
00:25:40,131 --> 00:25:41,300
heckler or you gonna be like,
shit,

560
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:43,620
this is,
can I better step back a little before I

561
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,560
call her this and that humanness and
that kind of,

562
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,300
that kind of opens the door for this to
be able to like,

563
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,740
oh,
now we're allowed to sue if this,

564
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,200
if the comedian is mean to me.

565
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,970
Yeah.
Well it's,

566
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,610
it's a dangerous precedent to set and
does,

567
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,440
does not make me comfortable and
hopefully I'll never have to deal with

568
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:02,770
it when I'm up there.
But what about though?

569
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,930
I mean there is like makes new orleans
look like blame like provo when she was

570
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,650
a beautiful town too.
I love performing there.

571
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,750
I find crowds and Canada to be really
polite.

572
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,190
I mean I've had some headquarters in
Canada,

573
00:26:16,191 --> 00:26:19,610
but you're going to have hecklers when
you get people drunk.

574
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,300
They're going gonna fuck it up.
I think the only thing you could do is

575
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:26,600
probably like they're doing in South
Carolina.

576
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,080
You just,
you have to boycott it to make some kind

577
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:31,490
of change,
you know,

578
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,250
uh,
how they're boycotting South Carolina.

579
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,320
One's he caught going to vancouver
because of this one room that.

580
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,810
No,
no.

581
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,120
The loophole was at the end of heckling.
You could just say,

582
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,983
just kidding.

583
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,840
You're like a fucking do the thing.
So I know what I'll do with a plane

584
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,940
crashes.
I'll just jump out at the last second.

585
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,640
Right before it hits the ground at the
end goal.

586
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,380
Allegedly.
Yeah.

587
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,910
You don't understand physics?
Not that I do,

588
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,140
but yeah.

589
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,151
I don't know,
man.

590
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,630
It's not a good thing.
It's definitely not a good rule.

591
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,970
Then the fact that he lost his very
dangerous for.

592
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,680
Well,
there's another one going on right now.

593
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,551
We're in.
Yeah.

594
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:15,090
Another guy got in trouble.
What is his name?

595
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,280
Chris?
Something or other is a comic from

596
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:19,500
montreal?
I think he speaks both languages.

597
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,830
I think he speaks french and english.
Chris wade.

598
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,830
Is that his name you see there?
They don't have the pesky first

599
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:27,160
amendment to deal with that.
Yes.

600
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,650
Yeah.
So this is what happened with this

601
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,810
gentleman.
Find out this dude's name is a dude

602
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:35,070
who's getting sued because there was a
sick kid and he made a joke about it.

603
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,850
He,
the joke was,

604
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:40,330
it was something.
I'm going to paraphrase it.

605
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm gonna do a shitty job,
but a lot of people donated money

606
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:48,330
because this kid was dying.
But then he lived for like several years

607
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,550
and then the joke was,
hey,

608
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,560
you know,
he wasn't even sick or something like

609
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:54,090
that.
Mike ward.

610
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,800
That's it.
What is,

611
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,480
what is the joke?
Pull up.

612
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:02,481
Pull up the joke so we could analyze it.
What did he say?

613
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,770
Oh no,
I'm afraid.

614
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,090
What was,
does it say what the joke?

615
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,010
The joke is,

616
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,633
oh,

617
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,540
a kid's got a serious illness.
That's not a snapchat filter.

618
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,083
Hmm.

619
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,290
Um,
we're looking for whatever the joke was.

620
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,930
It doesn't.
Does it show the actual joke or.

621
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:27,930
No?
No,

622
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:28,910
I don't think so.
No.

623
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,440
Maybe it might've been too offensive.
That's the thing is in this room where

624
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:34,760
it's like,
no rules.

625
00:28:34,761 --> 00:28:36,290
I'm afraid to even make a comment on
that.

626
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,870
That's a joke.
You could play the joke.

627
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:42,100
I'm not going to laugh.
I'm not going to smirk this.

628
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,790
There's a bunch of comedians you know,
that really enjoy saying ridiculous shit

629
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:50,960
that they don't really mean because it's
funny because it's so shocking.

630
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,560
Ridiculous that it's funny.
there's a real danger in pretending that

631
00:28:54,561 --> 00:28:59,561
those guys are just speaking their
absolute mind and like giving affidavits

632
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:04,601
and court relaying incidents with a cold
hard disengagement from the facts.

633
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:08,180
No,
these are comedians trying to say fucked

634
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:11,910
up shit that they don't really mean and
one of the reasons why it's funny,

635
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,000
it's because you know,
they don't really mean it and they're

636
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:15,500
saying it and it's ridiculous.

637
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,780
Like briAn holtzman,
right?

638
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,390
He's a great example.
Perfect example.

639
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:24,200
He's one of my favorite comedians ever
and he's so ridiculous.

640
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,800
He says thinGs that I don't want to give
away any of his material,

641
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:30,140
but he says things that he absolutely
does not mean.

642
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,630
Right?
And he says it in this character and

643
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:37,190
it's fucking hilarious,
but it's a landmine for anybody looking

644
00:29:37,191 --> 00:29:42,191
to point to a guy's performance on stage
and try to that somehow or another,

645
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,040
what he's doing is what he really means.
Right.

646
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:50,041
And if you see audience members getting
angry at it or or something that it's

647
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,680
hard to imagine how they can't see that
it's a character.

648
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,670
Yes.
You know,

649
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,770
that's not hate speech.
It's just a set material.

650
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,690
Maybe think that we're too close to it
honestly because I think if someone

651
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:03,970
didn't know it might take them a few
minutes,

652
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,670
like say if you're not a savvy comedy
store,

653
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,570
regular type person or someone who
enjoys common and a regular basis,

654
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,170
you could go and watch holtzman and go,
what the fuck is going on here?

655
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,940
And that might be what the fuck is going
on here?

656
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,480
Might last 10 minutes before you catch
on like that.

657
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:21,310
This guy,
because he'll let you in on it and he'll

658
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:25,720
smirk and Joke in between his,
his ramblings.

659
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,370
But I could see people not getting it.
Well that's the thing.

660
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,380
He'll,
he'll jerk and I'll make the smirk and

661
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,650
be in between things.
But the people who are already mad,

662
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,440
they skip over that part.
Yes.

663
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,220
They just think he's a crazy person.

664
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,990
He never justifies though.
Because I mean,

665
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,700
I think I've seen in your special.
You say a lot of this is just comedy

666
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,534
people.
Yeah,

667
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,090
but does he ever say no?
No,

668
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,943
no,
he didn't.

669
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,120
He did a 15 minute version of his gay
son the other day.

670
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:55,610
I have never seen a full 15 minute
version of that.

671
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,580
It was beautiful.
That could be a comedy special.

672
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:01,414
Just that.

673
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,180
Yeah,
that is the best examPle of his bits

674
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,060
too.
As far as like the most fucked up thing

675
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:12,830
you could imagine like in joke form,
but it's obviously not true.

676
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,450
It's so preposterous to it.
Oh my god.

677
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,530
It's funny and it could offend people,
you know,

678
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,580
and if it does to live in a punitive
society that,

679
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,370
that he can't perform being an artist
and perform his art because he has to

680
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:32,830
worry about being sued is already not
making enough money to be sued for no.

681
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,340
Well,
here's the thing.

682
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:39,341
You have the right to be offended you,
but people don't have to agree with your

683
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:43,640
opinions on things.
So if you're going to see art,

684
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,720
right,
whether or not you think stand up,

685
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,720
comedy is art,
you're creating it,

686
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,800
right?
You're creating that.

687
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,790
This guy is performing art.
You either like it or you don't like it,

688
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,820
and if you don't like it,
you don't have the right to interrupt

689
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:56,000
it.

690
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,700
You're supposed to leave.
Just leave that sort of polite person

691
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:00,980
does.
I've seen some stuff that I didn't like

692
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,680
and I left.
I've gotten to see a movie and I didn't

693
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:04,760
like it and I left.
That's,

694
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:08,120
there's nothing wrong with that.
But to interrupt it for everybody else

695
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,590
that's watching the movie,
that's a,

696
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:12,100
that's a piece of shit move.
So this,

697
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,290
you rewarding someone who did a piece of
shit move.

698
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,650
It's like it's not a good person.
You know,

699
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:21,350
a good person doesn't heckle me.
It's not that people who were hecklers

700
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:26,090
are bad people but they're drunk and
fucked up and that makes them a pain.

701
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,960
The ass,
you know.

702
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,420
But a lot of drunk fucked up people were
actually good people.

703
00:32:29,421 --> 00:32:32,210
Right?
But when you reward that kind of

704
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,930
behavior like this,
like you could say that you think that

705
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:39,020
the comedians not funny,
you could say don't ever go see him.

706
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
Could cast judge

707
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,940
me.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

708
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:45,380
But to say he owes her $15,000,
then it's like,

709
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:47,460
okay,
who is the retard in charge?

710
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,900
Who the who the fuck said yes to this
judge?

711
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,630
Is this a group of people?
Can I sit down with you,

712
00:32:53,631 --> 00:32:56,870
fucks and talk to you and try to figure
out what the fuck is going on in your

713
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,080
mind,
right?

714
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,950
You can charge him.
Ha.

715
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,990
What's the punitive rule for,
for the labeling that you know you have

716
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:09,830
to put the cancer and that's proposition
65.

717
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,650
You have to label all marijuana products
with this,

718
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,780
with this warning label that says this
product is known to contain chemicals

719
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,930
that may cause cancer.
So every,

720
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,020
even though cannabis is knowing that
treat cancer is known to not proven to,

721
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,600
but known to cause we can't do the right
research search.

722
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,030
Every piece of cannabis has to have
this,

723
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,080
this label on it or else you can be
fined for not having the label.

724
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,540
Again,
punitive society.

725
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:41,060
And we got sued.
We got sued for not having the labeling

726
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:45,980
on our packaging even though we did so.
So they decided to put a lawsuit against

727
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,910
400,
800,

728
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,030
800,
800.

729
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:51,160
It just went through weedmaps and just
see what everybody.

730
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,093
Everybody.
No,

731
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,810
they just did it just to try to scrap
some money out of you.

732
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,590
They said we'll make this go away.
Pace the settlement will make it go

733
00:33:57,591 --> 00:33:58,610
away.
Wow.

734
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:03,320
And this is what this person has done to
hundreds and hundreds of businesses.

735
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,810
That's how they make their living.
And she sued us in 2014 control.

736
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,710
Right?
That's crazy.

737
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,460
And products have it on it.
So we,

738
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,320
we were sued without even one burden of
proof because when we were like,

739
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,810
look,
everything has it on.

740
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:22,990
So did they just say the lawsuits
invalid or know enough to go through

741
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,230
with it?
Now we still got to go through it

742
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,350
because you can go through with it
wherever you were filing right now and

743
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:31,550
after it's filed then I got to file a
complaint with the bar and do all this

744
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:34,370
bullshit because anybody can sue anybody
now.

745
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:37,030
And it's really,
really hurts businesses that hurts good

746
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,140
people.
So how much did they want to settle?

747
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,790
About $20,000.
Oh my god.

748
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,640
So fucking criminals stealing money from
people from dispensary because they

749
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:50,330
think they have it.
But where they made their money is a on.

750
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,420
I mean every place has to have it.
If you walk into target,

751
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:57,110
you walk into walmart,
they all have to have have this thing

752
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,750
because anything that has plastics in it
or anything.

753
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Oh,
I see that sign everywhere now.

754
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:03,860
Once you get sued,
you're everywhere.

755
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,880
You see.
And that that's the law you got to have

756
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,900
posted.
So it was like you'd never hear the word

757
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:10,530
lesbian in vancouver again.
That's that.

758
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,990
Those,
the glory days are done.

759
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Is that what he yelled a lesbian?
I don't know what he said.

760
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,790
I don't remember what he said,
but I've heard worse so.

761
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,850
So it's too litigious of our society.
So companies,

762
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,540
bigger companies don't just settle
because it's easier to just settle.

763
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,470
But you know,
a smaller companies I guess they think

764
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,160
because marijuana,

765
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,690
you just have so much money.
However,

766
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:44,340
our tax burden is almost 70 percent.
There's no real money In it when you're

767
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,380
doing things by the book and they just
passed another 15 percent sales tax on

768
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,560
top of marijuana.
You all in California just got passed

769
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,540
this week through the senate and the
assembly.

770
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,990
The governor signs that another 15
percent tax is coming our way and that

771
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,730
gets passed to the consumer.
Yeah.

772
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I'm on top of the sales tax on top of
the city tax on top of the excise tax

773
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:07,080
and some of the cities and counties in
California having another,

774
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,290
another 10 or 15 percent on top of it.
You're also texting the growers in our

775
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,310
office so they're taxing anything that
has anything to do with what you get as

776
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:16,620
a final product.
If that's the case,

777
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,600
why would they be trying to stifle
business?

778
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,030
Wouldn't they want to promote business
because business is going to give them

779
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:24,120
more tax revenue.
This is the California.

780
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,760
It is.
It's because,

781
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,090
and a lot of it is because of law
enforcement unions and and not just

782
00:36:30,091 --> 00:36:32,340
them,
but prison guard unions and all these.

783
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:37,080
There's a lot of unions that put
pressure on different politicians to try

784
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:41,730
to keep the laws in place or to make
them even stricter because they want

785
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:44,310
more people to get arrested,
privatized prisons,

786
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,120
subsidized presence.
So that is such a dark concept that this

787
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:49,880
is something that we're really dealing
with it.

788
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,950
We really are.
And the problem is the penalties for the

789
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:55,680
users,
like having a joint is so very small,

790
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,470
but the penalties for the business for
doing it the wrong way are huge.

791
00:36:58,471 --> 00:37:02,060
Like our business is being crushed right
now over a stupid zoning suit.

792
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,010
Um,
so there's this big gap betWeen the

793
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:09,240
business penalty and the consumer
penalty so that the business has no

794
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,310
incentive really to do it the right way.

795
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,880
So because the consumer what you're
going to go into a shop and ask them,

796
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,620
hey,
do you pay your people on the books?

797
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,540
You know,
can I see your compliancy packet?

798
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,360
No,
you just go $40 a month.

799
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,900
I love that oj.
I'm buying it,

800
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,710
you know?
So with all these taxes that $40 eight,

801
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,900
it's got to go to $100.
Are we going to pay that or we just

802
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:31,650
going to go and call our dealer or
whoever that we've been using for 20

803
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:32,870
years.
So it's gonna.

804
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,600
It's just gonna make the black market
even a broader.

805
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,150
Well that's an issue that they've had in
Colorado for sure,

806
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:42,450
but people are happy to pay the taxes
because they liked the fact that it's

807
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:44,490
free.
Like the thing is free.

808
00:37:44,491 --> 00:37:47,400
They're like,
you can go and you can buy pot.

809
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,260
You don't have to have any kind of a
license,

810
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:51,900
you don't have to any and you can just
go do it and it's working.

811
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,800
So 39 percent is what they have to pay.
Like recreational and medical is much

812
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:57,690
less,
but people just pay it,

813
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,280
you know,
we're not happy about it,

814
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:01,930
but regulation is what we want.
We just want to follow.

815
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,670
We just want the path to the way to do
this the correct way.

816
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,400
Just make it fair.
Let's see what's going on in denver

817
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:12,990
should be the shining light for the rest
of the states because what they've done

818
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:13,970
is they've,
they've,

819
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:18,180
they've made money like they have so
much fucking money from tax revenue.

820
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:22,200
They made more money from tax revenue
than they did from alcohol taxes.

821
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:26,550
So last year Colorado takes in
$40,000,000 in tax revenue for cannabis.

822
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,270
California takes in $40 million dollars
in tax revenue from cannabis.

823
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,010
We have 30 million people in this state
compared to colorado's,

824
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,741
what?
Five,

825
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:38,260
6 million.
We're not collecting the taxes here,

826
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,190
so if the companies are not following
the rules as they stand,

827
00:38:42,191 --> 00:38:46,330
why we've thrown all these new rules at
them and setting up these monopolies

828
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:49,750
like here in la with the monopoly
stifling good businesses,

829
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,030
this doesn't help us and it doesn't
help.

830
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,190
The consumer either doesn't make any
sense.

831
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,220
It doesn't.
It's knowledge.

832
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,150
It would be dangerous.
It's not like if you get more pot out

833
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,340
there,
it's going to flood the streets and the

834
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:01,870
people are going to jump from the
building.

835
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,310
It's actually less dangerous or that
we've.

836
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:07,910
We've proven that and again,
that's why we're invited over and over

837
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,060
to places like the board of equalization
and to other places like oakland.

838
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,670
The city of oakland wants to follow our
delivery model.

839
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,270
It's because the way we do things
actually creates less,

840
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,060
um,
less crime,

841
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,320
less opportunity for crime because it's
just,

842
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,790
we're in,
you're in your living room,

843
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,380
you know,
we know who you are,

844
00:39:30,381 --> 00:39:31,820
you,
you sent in your documents.

845
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,470
We know you live at that address.
We know you are.

846
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,340
I went to a doctor,
we know everything matches,

847
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,520
so no one sees me walk in or out of a
place with a commodity that that's more

848
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:45,680
expensive than diamonds.
You know when,

849
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,810
when you're looking at a,
at a dispensary,

850
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,640
if,
if people are walking in and out of

851
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,410
there with duffle bags,
what do you think's in those duffle

852
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:53,360
bags?
it's very easy to,

853
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,620
to,
to,

854
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,450
for,
for crime that happened because it's

855
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:57,230
visible.

856
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,900
Done over 200,000 deliveries,
zero salts,

857
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,000
zero robberies,
zero complaints.

858
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:02,920
Knock on wood,
bitch.

859
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,763
That's great.

860
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,340
I will just let that go.
Know that

861
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,870
that's an importance to that,
but it is because we are very thoughtful

862
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,630
about how we go about,
um,

863
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,930
when you take a look at business,
making sure the person is who they are.

864
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,850
We do a google search on every single
patient.

865
00:40:22,851 --> 00:40:27,851
We turn down as many patients as we
would take maybe even more just to make

866
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:31,340
sure they are who they say and,
and uh,

867
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:32,410
that uh,
uh,

868
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,420
background of easy background check
doesn't pull up anything that says we

869
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:40,070
shouldn't work with someone like that.

870
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,220
Yeah.
Pedophiles apparently love weed too,

871
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,370
but we don't love pedophile so we don't
let them also like milk know what the

872
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,540
fuck are we doing?
So connecting marijuana with crime.

873
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:54,430
So stupid,
you know,

874
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:59,440
there's no facts to back it up anymore
just because just because some people

875
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,800
who use it are criminals,
but that doesn't mean it's causing

876
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:05,410
anything.
So there's no rationale for any of this.

877
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,290
And you're fighting against the idea of
tax revenue.

878
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,020
Like you're,
you're holding back revenue because

879
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,810
there a lot of people.
If it was,

880
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,010
there's a lot of people that are on the
fence.

881
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:16,930
Like man,
I think about opening up a pot store,

882
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,170
but fuck,
you know,

883
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,510
would have jeb bush winds,
you know,

884
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,000
there's a lot of people that think like
that.

885
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:26,530
Those people are not going to go in,
but if it becomes completely free and

886
00:41:26,531 --> 00:41:28,570
legal the way up,
you know,

887
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,460
blue jeans store would be blue jeans.

888
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,293
One of my,
my grandma

889
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:37,960
that I was trying for a reference
anything which is that if that happens,

890
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,790
store's going to open up everywhere and
the money's going to be crazy.

891
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:42,410
It's going to be a new economy.
Well,

892
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,600
it's still very possible with all the
people here.

893
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,130
yeah.
They'll still have to follow

894
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,660
regulations,
you know?

895
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,970
Um,
it's already billions on the books.

896
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,470
Well,
they should follow regulations because I

897
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:53,150
don't think that should be available to
everybody.

898
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,960
I think when you're young,
especially like this kind of fucking pop

899
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,840
they have here in la,
you imagine if you were a six year old

900
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,520
kid in detroit and you got a hold of
this shit.

901
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,590
No,
no,

902
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,460
it'S not.
Six year olds are not ready for this.

903
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,640
No,
it was definitely.

904
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,260
You should definitely come of age.
Yeah,

905
00:42:09,261 --> 00:42:12,080
I don't know what that age is.
I think we would have to decide as a

906
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:15,800
society how old someone should be before
they start drinking,

907
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,760
how it mean there's a lot of countries
that let kids drink like responsibly

908
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:24,020
with their parents when they're much
younger than 21 and they have less

909
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,980
incidents per capita of alcoholism than
some of the countries that are more

910
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:28,820
restrictive about it.

911
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,440
So I don't know who's right or who's
wrong.

912
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,970
I don't know.
I know americans,

913
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,880
You know,
it's things that work other places,

914
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:36,320
like we said before,
don't work here.

915
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,870
You know what?
I remember going to Italy as a 16 year

916
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:42,410
old school and the first thing we did
was run to like a bodega and buy beer

917
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,050
because you could.
Because we were amerIcan kids and were

918
00:42:45,051 --> 00:42:48,860
dicks and you can have beer,
so we didn't grow up responsibly so we

919
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:51,860
weren't acting responsibly.
We'd have to shift the whole way.

920
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,110
Our culture is to make those things
work.

921
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,120
Right,
and I don't know how to do that,

922
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,510
but I know that weed is the easy problem
to solve.

923
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,390
Alcohol is a demon.
That needs to be rooted out of our

924
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,420
society.
See,

925
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,780
I disagree with you.
I disagree with you.

926
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:07,210
I enjoy alcohol.
No,

927
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,730
I do too.

928
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,100
but I mean like can put the block then.
I mean just to see,

929
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,190
like when we started having the
conversation,

930
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:14,870
when people say,
let's compare it to alcohol,

931
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:17,700
I start licking my chops because when
you compare it to alcohol,

932
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,820
alcohol is.
Alcohol is poisonoUs.

933
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,830
Idig drinking.
I drank a lot,

934
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,800
a lot all the time.
Um,

935
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,540
so I'm not saying you did say that
though.

936
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:28,570
You just misspoke.
Misspelt don't.

937
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,990
I don't mean pull it away.
No,

938
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,040
no,
I understand.

939
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:34,880
But let's not demonize marijuana
compared to alcohol.

940
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:37,490
No.
Alcohol definitely ruins more people.

941
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,660
It's definitely way worse for your body.
it's definitely much more dangerous as

942
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:45,100
far as like operating cars and,
and behavior of the week.

943
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,760
The foolish things that people do in
their drinking.

944
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,793
Yeah.
All that stuff.

945
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:50,390
There's a lot of stuff that's directly
attributable to alcohol,

946
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:51,920
but.
So what,

947
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,390
so what,
you know,

948
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,900
look,
we've survived for so long with alcohol,

949
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:02,110
it's the regulations have worked to at
least to a manageable.

950
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,500
The fact that here's what You can't do,
you can't stop people from doing what

951
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:09,230
they want to do and not.
ExacTly.

952
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:11,630
And why is it that you could stop
someone from doing that,

953
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:15,800
but you can't stop them from practicing
doing flips and bmx bikes.

954
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:16,970
Right?
What would you.

955
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,650
Can you know?
Is it because they're there?

956
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,620
They're driving and injuring other
people will then take away their right

957
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,960
to drive.
Like that's how we have it set up

958
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,310
though.
They're injuring people getting in

959
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:30,260
fightS.
What do you lock them in jail yet?

960
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,710
But the rest of the people

961
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,460
leave us alone.
yeah,

962
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,290
we should have the right to choose too
many fucking rights.

963
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,920
We can control our own consciousness.
You can control what we put in our

964
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:40,290
bodies and here's most important
concept.

965
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,830
We're all just people.
They're all just people to like.

966
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:45,900
you can call them the government.
You can call them the police.

967
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:48,480
You can come the dea.
There are a bunch of fucking people.

968
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,630
That's all they are.
When you go behind some big crazy name,

969
00:44:51,631 --> 00:44:54,030
like it's say fbi open up.
People go,

970
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:55,230
oh shit.
It's the fbi.

971
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,350
If you go,
it's mike and steve and bob and we want

972
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:00,990
to see what kind of plants are growing.
Right?

973
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,230
Open up,
but who the fuck are you guys?

974
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,080
You guys are just some fucking people.
So when you write something down on

975
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,780
paper,
this is how archaic our our world is.

976
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,340
you write something down on paper that
decreased power to these regular people,

977
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,080
so these regular people the sudden have
the right to fucking shit.

978
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,830
Storm your house,
kIck open your door,

979
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:24,210
shoot your dog because you have a bag of
pot hidden in your fucking bureau

980
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:27,650
drawer.
This is the world we create is this is

981
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:30,990
the.
This is a real world and more people get

982
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:33,360
killed during those rates.
Then pat would ever kill.

983
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:34,980
That's for sure.
It doesn't kill anybody.

984
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:36,570
That's the most ridiculous thing that
they did.

985
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:37,620
Notice.
Still zero,

986
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,890
zero ever man.
TheY would be parading in front of us

987
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:44,550
every now and then like the mirror in
the uk or one of those fake newspapers

988
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,220
will put.
A young man dies on marijuana.

989
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:50,220
First known case,
but it's not true.

990
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,300
It's not true.
He can't.

991
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:53,940
It doesn't kill you.
It's not toxic.

992
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,910
It might fuck your head up,
fuck your head up,

993
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,790
but you should be allowed to make that
choice.

994
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,670
I'm going to fuck my head up.
Yeah,

995
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,920
and if you're abusing it than the people
around you will help you or whatever.

996
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,520
You know,
whatever needs to be done to just like

997
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,350
monster energy drinks.
I know people who drink those things all

998
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,170
day long and look,
I love the way those fucking things

999
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:17,820
taste and if you want to stay awake and
you're like,

1000
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:18,750
fuck it,
we're going in.

1001
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,440
THat is the way to go,
but you're not supposed to drink like 10

1002
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:25,680
of them in a day.
That dude needs an intervention.

1003
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,160
Some people are crazy.
They'll drink 10 of those giant red

1004
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,420
bulls.
The big red bull,

1005
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:34,220
you know when they started making red
bull like a beer can now will a bud tall

1006
00:46:34,221 --> 00:46:36,210
boy.
People that drink those all day.

1007
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,340
It's mostly people that have alcohol
problems that I would want to go to.

1008
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,980
Hey,
they could switch to caffeine.

1009
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:43,980
So I was like 20 coffees a day for some
of these guys.

1010
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,930
I went to the hospital because of those
energy drinks from heartbeat,

1011
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,960
palpitations and stuff like,
oh yeah man,

1012
00:46:48,961 --> 00:46:49,471
well,
you know,

1013
00:46:49,471 --> 00:46:51,810
they're great if you want one,
you know,

1014
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:55,340
and monsters probably actually like less
caffeine and some of them bad monster.

1015
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,670
And the monster is one of the better
ones.

1016
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:01,200
The better tasting one's the worst one
that I ever tried as far as like the

1017
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:03,510
jolt that it gives you is that red line
shit you remember.

1018
00:47:03,511 --> 00:47:04,870
That was it.
Uh,

1019
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,840
when I went to the hospital was the
mountain.

1020
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,640
They don't even make that any became
illegal.

1021
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,700
Red line is what's red hair?
It was scary.

1022
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:19,701
It was like can and in that kim was like
50 doses and you went down the whole

1023
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,850
thing,
but it was um,

1024
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,200
see if he could find it.
How safer those five hour energy drinks.

1025
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:27,780
I chose a pretty safe.
It's pretty safe.

1026
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,820
Those are mostly vitamin 12,
right?

1027
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,830
They only have a,
I want to say like 70 milligrams of

1028
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:33,940
caffeine,
a cup of coffee,

1029
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,250
a cup of coffee.
So they're safe.

1030
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,650
I don't feel the same drink in that as I
do at red bull.

1031
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:39,880
No,
I like it.

1032
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,430
It's better.
I like those be 12 drinks.

1033
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,410
I think b,
12 drinks are way better caffeine.

1034
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,320
Two hundred 50 milligrams of caffeine.
That doesn't seem like that much.

1035
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,380
It doesn't.
Just what?

1036
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,310
That's not an eight ounce bottle either.
ThAt is,

1037
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,080
it says it says per a fluid ounce
bottle.

1038
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,930
Coffee.
Like if coffee is 50 milligrams and the

1039
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,810
thInking of the wrong shit.
I swear I thought it was red line.

1040
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,910
Maybe I'm just wrong about the,
the uh,

1041
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,240
the sheer volume of caffeine and that
thing,

1042
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,950
but I thought it was just like
ridiculous.

1043
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:12,591
But anyway,
I,

1044
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:13,990
I drank it.
Whatever it was,

1045
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,480
it was this one or the other one that's
like,

1046
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,360
it that I mistake the name for it,
but it says starbucks and I remember

1047
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:20,080
thinking,
dude,

1048
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,210
I am just way too jacked up right now.

1049
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,130
Starbucks,
heavy caffeine.

1050
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,770
Yeah.
I especially their cold brew,

1051
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,410
I get the,
sometimes they get the trenta hold the

1052
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:32,230
fuck up.
A 20 ounce,

1053
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,570
that's a trenta none.
that's a venti.

1054
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,900
I get the one above that.
They don't even have the numbers for

1055
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:39,310
that.
But just saying a 20,

1056
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:44,370
a 20 ounce has 415 milligrams of
caffeine in tacky cardia.

1057
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,290
Holy shIt.
Is that real iced coffees more?

1058
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:48,100
I believe.
Yo.

1059
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,680
Look at this.
Decaf has 30 milligrams.

1060
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:54,760
Yeah.
The fuck is that decaf alWays has a

1061
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:55,570
level.
No,

1062
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,030
but 30 milligram.
I thought it was like five or something.

1063
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:00,190
I thought it was like trace amounts to
see what the ice coffee is.

1064
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:04,290
I believe it's a lot more really.
I get the trent usually.

1065
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,180
How is that possibLe?
A cold brew

1066
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,680
cold brew.
Three 30 where I guess it's not more,

1067
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,200
but I get the trend diversion,
so that's probably more.

1068
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,860
Yeah.
They can't keep serving you like that.

1069
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,000
They're going to have to have to pull
back.

1070
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,660
See,
that's the thing is,

1071
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,740
is I agree,
but then my libertarian side doesn't

1072
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:26,050
agree.
Why do you think you should drink that

1073
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,880
shit all day if you want.
Of course,

1074
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:31,090
my friend dave foley used to drink pots
of coffee pot.

1075
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,020
like all day he'd drink pots of coffee.
He had to stop putting cream in because

1076
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:37,720
he realized he was drinking a quart of
ice cream a day.

1077
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,090
I think of that every time I put cream
in my coffee,

1078
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:44,710
I think of your stories telling me about
that court cream just from coffee.

1079
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:46,330
yeah.
I like that.

1080
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:47,950
Fresh heady cream.
I constantly.

1081
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's what I'm talking about a year,
like a dark roast hawaiian coffee with

1082
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:57,850
some heavy cream
motherfucker.

1083
00:49:57,851 --> 00:50:00,910
You gonna make me feel good.
That's what cool that starbucks is now

1084
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,620
doing that they're doing with their cold
brew coffee.

1085
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:05,650
they have like a heavy cream that's like
karma or something.

1086
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,490
They mixed through it.
Nice.

1087
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,510
Yeah.
It's the cigarettes and coffee thing or

1088
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:12,710
the staples of the alcoholics,
right?

1089
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,840
Yeah.
A lot of people enjoy those cigarettes

1090
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,190
and they enjoy those,
uh,

1091
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,170
those coffees.
But you know,

1092
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,220
guys.
Yeah.

1093
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,200
But,
but in their eyes they feel like they've

1094
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:27,590
got the alcohol part under wraps now
because this stuff just kind of keeps

1095
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:29,840
them going and this stuff is not ruining
their life.

1096
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:30,700
Right.
I get it.

1097
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,430
A lot of alcohol.
She used cannabis the same way.

1098
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,620
Um,
and uh,

1099
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:38,500
that's not really accepted by aa.
so I know a lot,

1100
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,830
a lot of people who have,
um,

1101
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,200
kicked their alcoholism by moving more
towards cannabis,

1102
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,400
but again,
uh,

1103
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:48,160
within the gay community that they don't
like that,

1104
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:50,320
that's still considered a drug.
So,

1105
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:51,400
but you can get a degree

1106
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,720
good to anything,
you know,

1107
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:57,721
whether it's porn or big macs or where
we can get it a psychologically addicted

1108
00:50:58,871 --> 00:51:00,700
to anything.
But jamie didn't.

1109
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:04,660
The guy who created alcoholics
anonymous,

1110
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,790
didn't you have positive experiences
with lsd?

1111
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:10,570
That'd be funny.
That would be like,

1112
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,320
I feel like you did assets.
The only thing you're allowed to take

1113
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,580
guys.
Well I feel like I feel like that was

1114
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:19,090
something that happened like maybe even
a after.

1115
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,120
Well I don't want to speak out of
school.

1116
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,440
Yeah,
my right.

1117
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,313
Yeah.
Hold on.

1118
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,940
Yeah.
So what the fuck?

1119
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,420
Well that's why the government needs
testing on,

1120
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,150
on a lot of things.
So we know.

1121
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,710
Scroll that up please.
Alcoholics anonymous for a founder

1122
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,280
believed lsd could cure alcoholism.
Wow.

1123
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,930
Well you've seen so much research now in
psychedelics that clinics are opening

1124
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:45,220
up.
There's a clinic in,

1125
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,350
in la for,
for cattlemen,

1126
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,340
you know,
and you're seeing mda clinics opening up

1127
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,760
this,
what most of them do not realize that

1128
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:55,300
the program's co founder,
bill wilson,

1129
00:51:55,301 --> 00:52:00,301
credited the psychedelic drugs,
lsd for alleviating his alcoholism and

1130
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:03,700
believe the drug could be used to treat
others as well.

1131
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,250
Holy shit.
So those friends of bill,

1132
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:10,330
they didn't get all the information.
It's just kind of like friends of bill,

1133
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:12,610
if you're in the alcoholics anonymous,
right?

1134
00:52:12,611 --> 00:52:14,080
That's what they call themselves,
like friends of bill.

1135
00:52:14,081 --> 00:52:16,780
It's like the cold war,
but they didn't get that experience.

1136
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,790
It's kind of like the mushrooms that
quitting cigarettes do,

1137
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,530
but do you think they tell them,
I never heard this before today.

1138
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:27,010
How could you not tell these people?
Wilson first became big,

1139
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,610
began experimenting with lsd in los
angeles at the veterans administration

1140
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:34,930
back in 1956.
But after taking his first hit of acid,

1141
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:39,820
he realized that it was not the aspect
of terror that could help remedy

1142
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:42,790
alcoholism,
but rather the insight one could obtain

1143
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:46,660
from stepping into a world of simulated
insanity.

1144
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,890
Willow wilSon believed that using the
lsd could help.

1145
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:56,020
The alcoholic discover a power greater
than ourselves that in turn could

1146
00:52:56,021 --> 00:52:58,540
restore us to sanity.
However,

1147
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:02,350
he was adamant that using acid to combat
the demons of alcoholism was not

1148
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:05,410
something that he could,
that one could expect from a single

1149
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:09,360
dose.
Like more research is required and

1150
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,710
snacks.
Wow.

1151
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,910
Hmm.
That's interesting man.

1152
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,833
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1153
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,010
Psychedelics,
I think as we experiment with them

1154
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,600
medically are gonna reveal some secrets.
Skies skys a heavy duty tripper.

1155
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,280
They're going further down.

1156
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:30,290
He was tripping with aldous huxley.
Like this guy.

1157
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:33,270
This isn't like one experience you had
interesting.

1158
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,600
There's documentation that indicates
wilson was involved with many supervise

1159
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:40,260
lsd trials,
including someone's psychology

1160
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,190
psychologist,
betty eisner and brave new world author,

1161
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,650
aldous huxley,
which led him to believe that the

1162
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:51,450
visions and insights given by lsd could
create a large incentive,

1163
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,580
at least in a considerable number of
people,

1164
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:59,660
was with like a leader and in fact they
live left this out of the a pamphlet.

1165
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,310
How do they.
How could they leave this out?

1166
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:07,330
It's crazy because it seems like this
had to play a major part in this guy's

1167
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,030
ability to kick alcohol.

1168
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,710
Well,
it seems like at every major religion

1169
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:15,430
also left out the psychedelics that
probably created them as well.

1170
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:16,600
So I,
I think,

1171
00:54:16,601 --> 00:54:17,440
uh,
you know,

1172
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,230
you have,
I think a lot of times you got to leave

1173
00:54:20,231 --> 00:54:22,900
out the stuff that you think people
aren't going to follow you for.

1174
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,800
Wait a minute,
you've seen alcoholics anonymous,

1175
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,290
has a religion.
So what you just said,

1176
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:30,390
call you son of a bitch.
I can't even believe you,

1177
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,330
gina.
I thought we were friends.

1178
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,670
That is um,
that is really wild,

1179
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,410
man.
That's really interesting stuff.

1180
00:54:36,411 --> 00:54:38,780
But it totally,
it totally makes sense that it could

1181
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:42,890
help you a kick in addiction.
That totally makes sense because the

1182
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:47,920
stark contrast between being intoxicated
on it and what it feels like to be

1183
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:51,440
normal and this rethinking like a reset
button.

1184
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,660
That's what all the psychedelics
provide.

1185
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,970
That's really beneficial.
Besides being fun.

1186
00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:01,460
They all provide that reset that takes
you so far out of who you are right now

1187
00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:02,420
that when you come back,
you go,

1188
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:03,740
man,
am I doing this the right way?

1189
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,620
Right?
You know,

1190
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,510
now that I'm back to sober reality,
do I need to refocus this connection

1191
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:10,460
from your own ego?
Yeah,

1192
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:11,803
probably good idea.

1193
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,840
You know,
and yeah,

1194
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:17,870
you have the organization maps.
I had the guy from maps on the podcast

1195
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:22,110
who's that does the psychedelic
research.

1196
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:23,810
Um,
uh,

1197
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:25,570
I forgot what doblin?
Uh,

1198
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,060
yes.
Uh,

1199
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:29,820
so,
so just recently he,

1200
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,210
they,
they got um,

1201
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,900
uh,
authorized from the federal government

1202
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:38,901
to start doing research on cannabis for
the first time that federal federal ban

1203
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,460
was lifted.
And it was because because of maps,

1204
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,530
uh,
that they,

1205
00:55:42,531 --> 00:55:45,570
they were able to get that they were the
first ones granted that,

1206
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,900
that federal research on cannabis.
So,

1207
00:55:48,901 --> 00:55:50,000
um,
so it,

1208
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,410
it's in,
in very similar ways.

1209
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:56,130
We need to do research on lsd.
We need to do research on psilocybin

1210
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,150
because there could be medical effects
that just like cannabis were just

1211
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:03,300
denying because of years of,
um,

1212
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,040
you know,
this is the way it was.

1213
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,210
They're bad.
They're bad.

1214
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,570
Jamie put that back up.
That quote about,

1215
00:56:09,571 --> 00:56:11,130
bill,
this is crazy.

1216
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,650
look at this.
It says a.

1217
00:56:12,651 --> 00:56:14,940
unfortunately,
lsd made its way into the rooms of

1218
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,630
alcoholics anonymous.
Simply because others in a hierarchy

1219
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,390
hierarchy hierarchy did not support it
as a viable treatment.

1220
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,160
In fact,
a document published in 1984 by

1221
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:27,430
alcoholics anonymous world services in
New York explained that the reason the

1222
00:56:27,431 --> 00:56:32,431
program does not endorse the use of lsd
as word of bill's activity,

1223
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:35,620
this is all in quotes.
As word of bill's activitiEs reached the

1224
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:38,590
fellowship,
there were inevitable repercussions.

1225
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:43,330
Most aes were violently opposed to his
experimenting with a mind altering

1226
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:46,420
substance.
Lsd was then totally unfamiliar,

1227
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,870
poorly researched,
and entirely experimental dot,

1228
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:50,410
dot,
dot,

1229
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:54,130
and bill was taking it and quote,
I wonder,

1230
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,000
pills there was scared.
They were all scared that this guy was

1231
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,220
tripping.
That's hilarious.

1232
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:05,050
So they didn't want to include it even
though the founder of the program found

1233
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:09,970
it massively beneficial and it's almost
ironic that that trying to put it in

1234
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:12,100
there and they kicked him out basically.
Really.

1235
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,970
Whereas this apparent resistance to step
down,

1236
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,800
I was chastised for.
Wow,

1237
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:19,840
that's hilarious.
Isn't that crazy?

1238
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,490
Because timothy,
well,

1239
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,670
terrence mckenna attributed this quote
that timothy leary,

1240
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:27,400
but timothy leary said he never said it,
so nobody knows exactly who said it,

1241
00:57:27,401 --> 00:57:32,020
but that lsd causes violent reactions to
people who have never tried it.

1242
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,220
What?
Good.

1243
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,840
YeAh.
Very interesting.

1244
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:41,850
The people that haven't tried it are the
ones that are not the people who were on

1245
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:42,684
it.
Right.

1246
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:46,140
Do you think lsd though for real,
can solve anything?

1247
00:57:46,141 --> 00:57:48,750
I.
I've done it maybe over 200 times and

1248
00:57:48,751 --> 00:57:53,751
you might not be the best example
when you were taking it 200 times.

1249
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:56,880
A lot of that was recreational,
not,

1250
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,000
but I'm sure there was small little
things that I was probably going through

1251
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:05,001
that I could have used lsd to help me.
Like I like as an example,

1252
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,690
I took lsd once after a big breakup.
Did it help me get through that breakup?

1253
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:11,730
no.
it did nothing for my breakup,

1254
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:15,360
you know?
Or were you trading on it to try to use

1255
00:58:15,361 --> 00:58:18,360
it that way?
Or that's the thing.

1256
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:21,820
It's also going to go with your own
intention probably,

1257
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:23,670
and it's not.
It doesn't work for you.

1258
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,620
It's not like,
hey,

1259
00:58:25,621 --> 00:58:28,550
clean up my life.
I'm going to take some acid just right.

1260
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,350
no,
you got to do the work yourself.

1261
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:31,193
I just don't see it

1262
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,940
presents what it will.
All these psychedelics,

1263
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:36,670
like the good experiences,
the bad experiences represent what's the

1264
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:39,430
state of mind when you go into them.
That's why the people that take it

1265
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,660
really seriously and they go through
this all meditative ritual and they'll

1266
00:58:43,661 --> 00:58:47,680
do yoga,
do breathing exercises and they'll set

1267
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:52,450
like a tone to whatever they would like
to go into this experience with and say

1268
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:55,630
say that they're going into the
experience open and humble and say all

1269
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:58,510
these things out loud and then they
enter into the psychedelic trip.

1270
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,650
Like they do it that way because they,
they want to set an intention.

1271
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,100
If you just broke up with a girl and you
take asset,

1272
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,030
if you like,
really think about it.

1273
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,510
The exciting thing,
because you didn't help me when I broke

1274
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,430
up my girl.
Like that's really what you're saying.

1275
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,530
But you could also be like,
hey,

1276
00:59:12,531 --> 00:59:14,150
I want to quit smoking.
Take acid.

1277
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:15,050
Being like,
what happened?

1278
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,120
Did you quit smoking?
And like,

1279
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:19,940
and I know I focused on cigarettes and
then the whole place melted and in my

1280
00:59:19,941 --> 00:59:21,980
hand turned into a bunch snakes.
So no,

1281
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:23,430
I still went to.
Again,

1282
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,040
you don't really want to quit if you
wanted to quit,

1283
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,160
you just quit.
Right.

1284
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,220
But I don't think they asked the way.
Has anything to do with it?

1285
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:31,450
Doesn't.
It doesn't help you.

1286
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:35,200
It's not going to just decide for you.
Like it depends on what's the intention

1287
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:38,620
that you go into taking any psychedelic,
whether it's mushrooms or whatever.

1288
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,200
What's the intention that you go into
this,

1289
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:45,610
this trip with and you can't think like
acid doesn't work because it didn't help

1290
00:59:45,611 --> 00:59:48,370
me quit smoking.
Like you didn't help you quit smoking.

1291
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,050
Like these are decisions that you make?

1292
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:50,571
Yeah,
I,

1293
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:55,400
I just don't see how acid it.
Unless it's really bad acid that will.

1294
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,240
You'll remember anything except melty
stuff in the walls.

1295
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:03,290
Melting and lizards.
I just don't see any kind of help on our

1296
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:04,580
lesser,
lesser level.

1297
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:09,581
Do you feel like cannabis has changed
your personality because you know that

1298
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:12,420
is something you might not go into st.
Alright,

1299
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,360
I broke up with tonight,
I'm going to smoke weed for it.

1300
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:18,260
But throughout your lifetime,
has cannabis had an effect on you that

1301
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:20,450
you feel like it's changed your
personality?

1302
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,520
I've been smoking since I was like 14,
15,

1303
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:24,680
so I don't even know what my personality
was before,

1304
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:26,750
if anything.
I think marijuana made me more paranoid

1305
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,280
and scared,
you know,

1306
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:33,430
I was more freaked out and stuff.
But as a medicine for headaches and I

1307
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,710
don't take almost any pills now.
I don't have tylenol in my house

1308
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:36,950
anymore.

1309
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,510
If I,
if I have a headache I use weed.

1310
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,270
So for that it has helped me
tremendously.

1311
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:45,350
But personality wise probably not.
It probably made me more paranoid and

1312
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,290
awful as a person when smoking it
because I'm,

1313
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,850
you know,
I get panicky,

1314
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,600
you know,
if I,

1315
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,050
if I'm super stoned in a room of people,
it's not helping me at all.

1316
01:00:54,051 --> 01:00:55,490
It's making it worse.
If anything.

1317
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,980
What about you joe?
And he started later,

1318
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,310
later that you know,
you didn't start as a teenager.

1319
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,400
So do you feel like it's made a
difference on who you are?

1320
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,940
Yeah,
it changes your perspective.

1321
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:08,080
It,
uh,

1322
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:12,190
it offers you some,
a different frequency of insight I would

1323
01:01:12,191 --> 01:01:13,420
say.
I think that,

1324
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:16,810
uh,
one of the things that's done that's

1325
01:01:16,811 --> 01:01:18,040
good is it,
it,

1326
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,900
it makes me consider things that I might
not be thinking about and uh,

1327
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,660
it,
it gives you almost a deliminates areas

1328
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:28,870
of your consciousness that maybe you
weren't paying attention to.

1329
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:33,160
It's mAde me a nicer guy.
Like I'm kind of a type a high strung

1330
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:36,100
guy and like if there's an employee that
I just want to strangle,

1331
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,130
I can take a hit of,
of the no ga and suddenly be like,

1332
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:39,781
no.
And he's,

1333
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:40,970
he's,
he's all right.

1334
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:43,300
He's had a hard day.
Exactly.

1335
01:01:43,301 --> 01:01:46,810
Instead of accelerating that kind of
behavior and shitty behavior,

1336
01:01:46,811 --> 01:01:51,400
it definitely makes you more,
more inclined towards fellowship and

1337
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,230
kindness.
It's just a,

1338
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:56,110
it's a really good chemical,
you know,

1339
01:01:56,111 --> 01:01:59,980
it's a really good reaction that your
mind has to this natural plant for

1340
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:03,310
creative reasons.
One hundred percent definitely opens up

1341
01:02:03,311 --> 01:02:05,740
a different pathway in your head.
I like it for everything.

1342
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,080
I like it for a lot of different things.
I like it but it.

1343
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:10,540
But for creative reasons,
it's one of the best things.

1344
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:10,940
Yeah,
yeah,

1345
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,800
sure.
You know,

1346
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:15,820
a lot of are a celebrity patients that
are,

1347
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,040
you know,
working in comedy or music or

1348
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,540
a television or the movies they want
sativas specifically.

1349
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,750
So,
um,

1350
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:29,430
they're not down at all because you
sativas are more known for their

1351
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:31,740
creativity and things like that.
So,

1352
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,490
so we find people who are working in the
creative field,

1353
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,410
theY want to smoke sativas,
you know,

1354
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,910
um,
which is an important distinction

1355
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:45,990
between indicas and sativas pizza.
A lot of people don't know that

1356
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:51,150
different parts of different types of
marijuana can affect you differently,

1357
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,610
you know,
and um,

1358
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:56,370
there are some people who were
medicating for certain ailments while

1359
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:59,850
they should smoke something that
specifically worked for those elements.

1360
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,833
If,
um,

1361
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,490
if you're smoking because you're looking
for creativity because you're looking

1362
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:06,750
for,
um,

1363
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:08,530
that uh,
um,

1364
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:09,900
you know,
uh,

1365
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,710
you don't want to lay on the couch and
go to sleep,

1366
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,330
then you should smoke,
smoke sativas.

1367
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:17,460
Um,
if you are looking for that,

1368
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:19,170
it's nighttime.
I want to relax.

1369
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:19,680
Uh,
you know,

1370
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,540
time to go to bed,
you should smoke into cars because

1371
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,700
that's going to bring you down and give
you that body high with,

1372
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:24,331
with,
uh,

1373
01:03:24,331 --> 01:03:26,600
the cbd chemical that's inside.

1374
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:28,250
Got,
that's what I want.

1375
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,031
I'm like,
brian,

1376
01:03:29,031 --> 01:03:29,780
I don't,
I get,

1377
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:33,350
I get jumpy with steve.
I get a little bit Freaked out,

1378
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,300
a little paranoid.
Pussies move in together.

1379
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:39,390
Hey,
I think we're neighbors actually are.

1380
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,030
Yeah,
I know.

1381
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:42,890
Look,
we've all been to high.

1382
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,630
No,
everybody's been too high,

1383
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,733
you know.
Um,

1384
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,250
one of the most famous scientists wasn't
carl sagan.

1385
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,580
It was some other famous scientists.
Uh,

1386
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:54,030
it was a theoretical mathematician,
guys,

1387
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:55,520
the rights,
all that crazy scribble shit.

1388
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:57,890
He would just,
he would just talk about how he likes

1389
01:03:57,891 --> 01:03:59,420
one hit.
That's what he likes to take.

1390
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:02,300
Just one hit.
Just go for a walk on these ideas would

1391
01:04:02,301 --> 01:04:04,100
come to them.
It's like you don't have to get fucking

1392
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:05,660
blasted,
just one hit.

1393
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:10,700
That's why I was so against it at first
is because I thought one hit made you

1394
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:13,250
really fucked up because that's how I
saw gino.

1395
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,950
But it turned out,
gina would say you were such a dick to

1396
01:04:15,951 --> 01:04:18,250
me when I smoked weed in your house that
I have to go outside,

1397
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,050
smoke a whole joint in two minutes and
come in and be a mess.

1398
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,330
So that was what I was exposed to.
It was,

1399
01:04:23,331 --> 01:04:25,610
I don't want any of that.
I didn't realize you could just take one

1400
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:29,900
hit and just chill out and still work
and still function.

1401
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,570
Nobody knows.
And it makes people nicer.

1402
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,670
The definitely does.
It did it for me,

1403
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:37,200
you know,
uh,

1404
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,340
I think,
um,

1405
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,740
you know,
to say that,

1406
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:42,990
uh,
what are the medical facts?

1407
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:45,870
What,
what are you treating yourself for it?

1408
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:50,871
It's almost silly to say because
everyone else who's not really treating

1409
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,270
themselves for a cancer or something
like that,

1410
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,520
they are getting mood regulation out of
it.

1411
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,190
So even if you wanT to call it
recreational smoking,

1412
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,050
you're still getting mood regulation out
of it.

1413
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,640
And those people who smoke it almost
daily or whatever on whatever schedule

1414
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:07,230
they smoke it on,
they might have,

1415
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,240
if they didn't,
they might be on percocet,

1416
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,980
they might be on,
you know,

1417
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:14,310
welbutrin and they might be on a million
other other drugs.

1418
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:18,070
So to say that recreational use is
people just getting high.

1419
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:23,250
That's also also not accepting that
people are looking for mood regulation

1420
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:29,920
as a medical effect.
So we already have it with coffee.

1421
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,420
Yeah.
Coffee,

1422
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:33,580
nicotine,
booze.

1423
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:36,880
That's all business.
There's so many different things.

1424
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:40,480
We already accept sugar.
Well sugar is the scariest one.

1425
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,890
Yeah,
that shit's everywhere.

1426
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,890
Once you start paying attention to it.
But the Idea is that you should be able

1427
01:05:44,891 --> 01:05:46,840
to do whatever you want.
If you want to eat candy bars all day,

1428
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:51,250
that should be completely up to you.
And that's not where we are,

1429
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,740
you know?
And the fact that that's not where we

1430
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,780
were,
where we are with one of the most

1431
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:59,230
beneficial plants the world's ever known
because that's really what it is.

1432
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,820
Especially since it's connection to him.
It's the most beneficial plant the

1433
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:05,590
world's ever known.
And it's illegal.

1434
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,600
I mean,
that doesn't show you how stupid people

1435
01:06:07,601 --> 01:06:08,320
are.

1436
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,300
I mean,
we're so god damn goofy.

1437
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,510
We are and it's gonna.
It's goNna get worse before it gets

1438
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,410
better,
unfortunately.

1439
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:17,500
Think because the laws are such a mess
right now.

1440
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,420
Listen,
hillary clinton's gonna fix everything.

1441
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,280
She gets an offer.
She's going to be great.

1442
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:25,070
She's always been a top shelf.
Well,

1443
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,160
who Donald Trump?
is he going to fix it?

1444
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:27,791
He doesn't.
He.

1445
01:06:27,791 --> 01:06:29,330
I don't think he cares.
He cares.

1446
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,870
I know he doesn't care.
I know that.

1447
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:32,621
Perfect.
Thank you.

1448
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:35,580
With the legalized marijuana nationwide,
I get a lot of stoller.

1449
01:06:35,581 --> 01:06:37,480
Switch gears.
Know what scares me.

1450
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:40,450
Is that what if he makes chris christie,
the attorney general?

1451
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,000
That would be.
It would be hilarious.

1452
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:44,910
It'd be so bad for my business,
dude.

1453
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:46,480
Have you been?
It'd be hilarious.

1454
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:49,110
That guy is not going to be the attorney
general it.

1455
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:51,580
If he's not.
The attorney general will take anybody

1456
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:53,430
with however you got so full.

1457
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,010
He's so foolish.
Has his opinions on marijuana while

1458
01:06:57,011 --> 01:06:59,830
consuming copious amounts of sugar and
public.

1459
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,840
they're so ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

1460
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:04,960
He put a bag of m and m's inside is m
and m's after,

1461
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:08,200
after he had stomach surgery.
I mean it's a crazy person,

1462
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:10,810
so this guy is addicted to sugar.
One hundred percent,

1463
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:14,020
but that's clear.
So no way you stay that big unless

1464
01:07:14,021 --> 01:07:15,730
you're eating terrible.
That's just it.

1465
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:20,140
But he'll go with one thing is legal.
One thing is not saying end of story.

1466
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:21,820
Who's an insane person,
but that's what.

1467
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,440
That's what we're fighting with the
city.

1468
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,540
Just this is the law.
End of story.

1469
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,360
You get the chance.
He can't even win the democratic side

1470
01:07:31,361 --> 01:07:32,860
anymore.
still voting for gary,

1471
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:33,910
man.
Gary Johnson.

1472
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,730
You got Gary Johnson is a better.
It's almost.

1473
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,910
Well it's a more likely vote than bernie
at this point.

1474
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,430
I just don't think like physically he
can win,

1475
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:46,360
but could happen though is he and
hillary could team up and would be a

1476
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:47,950
formidable twosomes so great.

1477
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,830
I think it'd be hillary and then he
would be the vice president.

1478
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:53,560
I can be crazy though.
That's so left.

1479
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,540
If they said any nancy shit to each
other.

1480
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:56,700
It's kind of.
That's where it gets.

1481
01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:57,783
Yeah,
you got it.

1482
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,640
You got to curb your words when you're
running,

1483
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:01,870
right.
You've got to make sure that you don't

1484
01:08:01,871 --> 01:08:03,970
get to negatives so that you could join
forces.

1485
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,600
Would they put a socialist on the ticket
in the United States of America?

1486
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,130
While it's democratic socialist,
it's not entirely like a socialist to

1487
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:13,680
beat trump.
I think they might be tricky.

1488
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:14,950
It's tricky.
It's tricky,

1489
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,940
but he does have the support of the
youth.

1490
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:17,990
You know,
he's,

1491
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,590
he's got people fired up socially.
You know,

1492
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,110
he sits down with people like killer
mike and as long term interviews.

1493
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:25,640
you know,
he's interesting.

1494
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,020
He's an interesting.
He's different.

1495
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,640
He doesn't accept money from.
I look,

1496
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:30,080
I like a lot of what he stands for.

1497
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,380
I think half of it.
I liked him way better than I like her.

1498
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:38,980
I'm not a big fan of the whole,
like long term politicians.

1499
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,900
I'm not a big fan of those kind of
people.

1500
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,410
There just seems like You just have too
many compromises along the way.

1501
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,240
There's too much lIke weaving in and out
of the system in the morning and toys in

1502
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:52,220
the system.
The more suspicious we should all be.

1503
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:54,180
She's way more intertwined in the
system,

1504
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:55,820
of course,
but here's an example.

1505
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:58,700
I'm speed.
We'd shut down by proposition day,

1506
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:02,190
which was written by a lawyer who
represents a bunch of dispensaries that

1507
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:06,860
are predicted by proposition day.
Those are some dots you can connect

1508
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:09,170
them.
So an attorney writes a law that

1509
01:09:09,171 --> 01:09:11,600
protects his clients and it gets passed.
How does that happen?

1510
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,930
I don't know,
but I know the career politicians don't

1511
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,990
make things better for us.
Yeah.

1512
01:09:17,991 --> 01:09:20,510
They only do if it's the will of the
people in the ceiling where they could

1513
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,490
stay in office,
but usually it's not really just the

1514
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:24,170
will of the people.
It's people aren't really paying

1515
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:26,390
attention because the goal of these
corporations,

1516
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:29,300
they get involved or donate your money
and the people don't even know what the

1517
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:31,400
fuck is happening while it's happening.
That's right.

1518
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,370
Well,
that's what we have.

1519
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:33,480
Exactly.
Exactly.

1520
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:34,590
Going on here.
You know,

1521
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,060
there's a lot of those laws,
right?

1522
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,340
Yeah.
Well,

1523
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,770
we were dealing with a lot of them,
you know,

1524
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,720
again,
to say that um,

1525
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,880
you know,
business had to be in operation before

1526
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:49,710
2007 in order to be considered a,
you know,

1527
01:09:49,711 --> 01:09:51,660
now to be a viable business.
Well,

1528
01:09:51,661 --> 01:09:56,640
if you were in operation in 2007,
you learn in that wild west category.

1529
01:09:56,641 --> 01:09:59,160
So,
so you were already skating that line.

1530
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:03,180
Do you want the players that were bad
players involved or do you want good

1531
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:07,090
companies that want to put in a
standing,

1532
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:11,070
a standard operating procedures that are
looking for best practices?

1533
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,080
Why wouldn't you want companies like
that?

1534
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,180
You know,
we just laid off 40 people

1535
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:19,660
well that are now in unemployment.
40 good people that really can't get

1536
01:10:19,661 --> 01:10:23,830
decent jobs anywhere that we're paid
well above minimum wage are now just

1537
01:10:23,831 --> 01:10:28,540
laid off and going on the government
dollar because it's because of this law

1538
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:30,610
that nobody knows about and nobody read.

1539
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,410
You know?
And,

1540
01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:34,300
and for us,
it came at a time where we,

1541
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:39,360
we were
so excited about the future of working

1542
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,270
with the board of equalization.
We were in,

1543
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,460
in our largest expansion at the time,
um,

1544
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,370
we were going from the largest market
which was la to expanding throughout all

1545
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:51,380
of California,
which we're still doing that,

1546
01:10:51,410 --> 01:10:56,300
but we just now have to not include la,
which was our main base.

1547
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:59,390
So in the law,
what the law pertains to is you

1548
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:04,391
delivering things to people that live in
homes because that home has not been

1549
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:08,180
cleared because as a place to do
business,

1550
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:10,310
because it,
because of the zoning law,

1551
01:11:10,311 --> 01:11:14,040
only these 135 pre ico is allowed to

1552
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,130
operate at all within the city.
Nobody else can join the club.

1553
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:22,430
It's only that 1:35.
And any marijuana wanna vehicle is an

1554
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:27,240
extension of the marijuana business.
So every car is zoned like a building.

1555
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:30,870
So essentially they've limited the
number of stores that can operate the

1556
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:33,960
number of dispensaries.
And you guys got pushed out because you

1557
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:37,110
didn't have a grandfathered in.

1558
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:38,070
Well that,
that's,

1559
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:41,580
that's number one.
But number two is our base.

1560
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:45,330
Where our business is,
is not in the city limits of la.

1561
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:50,480
So by normal law for any other business,
you follow the laws of the municipality

1562
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,690
in,
we just convey through the streets of la

1563
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,850
and there's a law on the California
books that says you can't stop someone

1564
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:03,990
if your business is not in one
municipality and you drive to another

1565
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,810
municipality to deliver something.
You can't stop that.

1566
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,310
So we're not even in la and we have to
have to deal with this.

1567
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:16,240
We're outside the city of la because the
city of la encompasses hollywood and and

1568
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,350
a lot of la,
but they're in places that people think

1569
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:21,960
are la,
like beverly hills or west hollywood.

1570
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,370
Those are in la.
Lawsuit

1571
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,020
says we're operating a sophisticated
delivery company running seven,

1572
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:32,070
about seven hubs out of the la,
out of the la area.

1573
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:32,731
It's like,
well,

1574
01:12:32,731 --> 01:12:36,540
where are the addresses on the lawsuit?
There are none because we don't have any

1575
01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,480
locations inside the city.
We don't roll orders out of there,

1576
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:43,290
but it's not in the paperwork.
Just so

1577
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,310
goofy though.
This is what's the problem?

1578
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:47,660
This is the scary problem with big
government.

1579
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:51,890
This is the problem with government that
just has too many regulations,

1580
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,710
too much red tape and too much bullshit
stuff like this

1581
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,260
and there should be a balance of harm to
our company,

1582
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,310
uh,
that,

1583
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,143
that,
um,

1584
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:04,330
is trying to work within every
regulation of California working with

1585
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:06,900
the state to create them,
you know.

1586
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:08,430
Well,
let me ask you this,

1587
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,750
when is it going to be legal?
Is it an on the books to be in november

1588
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:13,800
to november,
november?

1589
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:14,311
Yes.
Well,

1590
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:18,420
we have to organize like this is an
important thing for the future of

1591
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:20,720
mankind.
It is,

1592
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,390
must be done there and unfortunately
there's even infighting within the

1593
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,310
cannabis industry.
Yeah.

1594
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:27,930
Well,
you know what the problem that I ran

1595
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:29,810
into when we were talking about the,
uh,

1596
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:34,050
the legalization vote,
the growers didn't want it to be legal

1597
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,290
because they would make less money or of
course you guys are growing illegally.

1598
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:38,430
And I was like,
wow.

1599
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:39,211
And he's like,
hey man,

1600
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:42,260
I'm just telling you the truth,
but where we're at

1601
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:45,670
point now that if we don't do that,
they're going to get pushed out anyway

1602
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:50,110
by bigger corporations that will come in
and be able to pay millions of dollars

1603
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:52,060
for licensing and buildings and things
like that.

1604
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,890
People are greedy and they're
shortsighted.

1605
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,740
You can't be greedy.
You can't be shortsighted.

1606
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,920
You can.
This is a,

1607
01:13:57,921 --> 01:14:02,600
this is a global issue.
And in these environments where these

1608
01:14:02,601 --> 01:14:03,500
people are saying,
we're going to,

1609
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:06,170
we're going to make less money.
Bullshit expand.

1610
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:08,170
It's going to be legal now.
Dummy.

1611
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:08,931
Like,
yeah,

1612
01:14:08,931 --> 01:14:12,010
you're going to have competition.
so fucking they were making money.

1613
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,830
Why do you care if other people are
making money while you're concentrating

1614
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,960
on that?
Just just enjoy life.

1615
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:18,700
You're gonna have a bunch of potheads
mIllionaires around.

1616
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:18,800
Yeah,

1617
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,350
right.
And you know,

1618
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:26,210
along those lines,
as we were cultivating for our own

1619
01:14:26,971 --> 01:14:29,170
patient base,
we were filed.

1620
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:33,560
We follow the California a.
The law is for California.

1621
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:38,570
The cultivate.
Once a local licensing started becoming

1622
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,900
possible for cultivation.
It wasn't before,

1623
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:45,990
uh,
the governor sign this bill last year.

1624
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,430
Now it's becoming possible we went out
and we are now participating with desert

1625
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:55,630
hot springs for illegal cultivation,
so it's going to be a place where the

1626
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:58,620
police could come in,
the government could come in and inspect

1627
01:14:58,621 --> 01:14:59,270
it.
So,

1628
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:04,270
so we're moving forward with full
legalization on cultivation is as well

1629
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,930
paying,
paying everything you got to pay for

1630
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:09,380
making sure that you,
uh,

1631
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,710
your,
when you build your building,

1632
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:14,430
it's built to the right specs again,
the governments involved in every part

1633
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:16,350
of it.
So again,

1634
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,890
we're moving forward with the
regulations,

1635
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:21,840
even though it's gonna cost us a lot of
money aren't,

1636
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,360
you know,
the investment team that's behind it has

1637
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:27,990
already put $2,000,000 in just to buy
the property,

1638
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,340
you know,
so,

1639
01:15:29,341 --> 01:15:31,710
um,
it's gonna cost a lot of money and we're

1640
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,840
not,
you're not going to make the money,

1641
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:36,060
you know,
millions of dollars that you're hoping

1642
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:39,690
for,
but at least you're doing it in a way

1643
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,280
that can be regulated and you can open
up your doors and not hide.

1644
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,950
Because we don't want to hide everything
we've ever done.

1645
01:15:46,951 --> 01:15:49,770
We haven't hidden.
We've said everything in the media.

1646
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:51,300
Hey,
we're following regulations,

1647
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:53,700
we're,
we're trying to do everything the right

1648
01:15:53,701 --> 01:15:54,710
way.
We're paying,

1649
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,400
paying,
paying the taxes.

1650
01:15:56,401 --> 01:15:58,260
We have to pay where we're working.

1651
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:00,950
Well,
that's why we got sued is because if you

1652
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:03,020
sue speed weed that gets your name in
the paper,

1653
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:05,480
you see the display,
you know the delivery that one of the

1654
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:09,050
other 400 delivery services that you can
find operating right now today that are

1655
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:11,000
illegal,
that's not going to get your name in the

1656
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:15,290
paper in an election year.
Maybe It's a conspiracy theory,

1657
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,860
but all of the facts in our case are
dated 2014.

1658
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,350
We got served in 2016.
I don't know.

1659
01:16:21,351 --> 01:16:26,351
Is this a special year to politicians?
Maybe it's a special year.

1660
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,380
Hold on for a second.
So there are certain delivery companies

1661
01:16:30,381 --> 01:16:33,260
that are allowed to operate inside lno.
Nobody's allowed,

1662
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:36,460
no one that they are what they are,
but they do 400.

1663
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,230
The do 400 illegal ones.
Well,

1664
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:43,220
they're all podcasts,
golden snitches.

1665
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:47,720
So we're going to start doing overnight
delivery with medical carriers to the

1666
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:48,530
entire state.

1667
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:51,740
So speed we'd will deliver it to
anywhere in California.

1668
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:54,620
That's allowed not inside the city
limits of la,

1669
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,320
but outside the city limits.
You're in fresno,

1670
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,030
you were in sacramento or wherever you
are,

1671
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:04,720
a patient meet you at the border of taco
stand at the border and you make a hand

1672
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:09,110
off certain patients.
Maybe burbank in la.

1673
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,430
Burbank is nike's not,
not in la.

1674
01:17:11,431 --> 01:17:12,820
Oh,
so I can still get delivery.

1675
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,970
You could until the.
Until they tell the delivery services to

1676
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:20,150
stop.
But burbank does not like the industry.

1677
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:24,790
Just like glendale and pasadena do not
like the industry was that there's,

1678
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,460
it's,
it's the propaganda machine and it's,

1679
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:27,951
it's,
you know,

1680
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:31,460
law enforcement shows up.
IT's the city hall and start screaming

1681
01:17:31,461 --> 01:17:33,170
about if you have a dispensary is going
to have crime.

1682
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,530
Delivery's going to be a lot of cash or
product in the cars.

1683
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,870
you're bringing crime.
And they frightened the city council and

1684
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,610
the people that vote in saying,
all right,

1685
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:44,840
so we don't want it here.
So leT let it happen in echo park where

1686
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:46,990
the hippies live.
We're here in burbank with,

1687
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:47,750
you know,
with this,

1688
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,680
the studios,
we don't want it in the studios.

1689
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,920
I would want it because so many of the
actors or private app,

1690
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:54,020
we'd,
I need it to live.

1691
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,300
They do,
they do.

1692
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:57,910
They've delivered all like on movie
sets.

1693
01:17:57,940 --> 01:17:59,890
Yeah.
That of course they do.

1694
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,860
Everybody knows roles that people play
probably have to be as you fucking do

1695
01:18:03,861 --> 01:18:06,310
it.
I Wonder if Daniel Day lewis smokes

1696
01:18:06,311 --> 01:18:07,060
weed.
Fuck yeah.

1697
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:08,770
Does we can talk about,
uh,

1698
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:11,500
uh,
privacy of certain patients

1699
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,370
we try and say they're trying to say
anything.

1700
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:19,030
I'm saying a lot of the actors you,
you would think are smoking weed while

1701
01:18:19,031 --> 01:18:19,810
they were acting.

1702
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:23,980
They are interesting.
Of course they are.

1703
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,200
Whereas here,
I know several who don't have to name

1704
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,210
names,
but I know a lot of people get super

1705
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:29,800
high as fuck right before the do a
scene.

1706
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:31,720
Sure.
Kind of makes sense.

1707
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:33,730
Uh,
you know,

1708
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,650
uh,
I mean you've introduced me to some,

1709
01:18:35,651 --> 01:18:37,240
so certainly certainly,
you know,

1710
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:38,730
um,
and uh,

1711
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:43,920
they're just as many that you would
never suspect that that guy is a

1712
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:46,720
everyday smoker and they are.
And um,

1713
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:51,010
and that's because you know,
there's still stigma and when you're

1714
01:18:51,011 --> 01:18:53,680
living in a public life you need
privacy.

1715
01:18:53,681 --> 01:18:56,470
And that's one of the reasons you need
delivery because some of my,

1716
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,860
my patient basis,
if they walk into a dispensary,

1717
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:04,790
they're gonna lose endorsements and
sponsor money from [inaudible].

1718
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,000
They're on family shows,
things like that.

1719
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:09,070
Well,
how is that fair to them?

1720
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:11,770
They need their Medication.
They need safe access to their

1721
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:12,604
medication.

1722
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:14,730
They can't.
You're saying it all granted they're

1723
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,470
trying to get high to settle the fuck
down.

1724
01:19:16,471 --> 01:19:19,000
I know they need their medication.
They're dying.

1725
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,510
We ask them.
We have to protect it to him quickly.

1726
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,980
Our disney kids toys,
one of society's seep deep into his

1727
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:27,870
brains.
Joe,

1728
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,040
have you been to a denver yet?
Since?

1729
01:19:30,041 --> 01:19:30,874
Uh,
since then,

1730
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:33,070
since illegal.
I was just there like four months ago,

1731
01:19:33,071 --> 01:19:34,090
five months ago,
something like that.

1732
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:37,000
She's just walking down the street.
Just walk into anything.

1733
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:39,010
Pop places everywhere.
They're all over the place.

1734
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,930
Did.
So it's like amsterdam.

1735
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,270
It's like some weird new american
amsterdam.

1736
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:47,170
And there's so much money in
real estate.

1737
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:51,400
Prices are skyrocketing.
Real estate prices are up 19 percent.

1738
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,440
How's the prices like,
like it's just say like a joint in,

1739
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:57,330
in denver or you have any idea?
It's,

1740
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,440
it's,
it's more expensive thAn it is here,

1741
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:03,980
and they do have different pricing for
medical as they do for recreation.

1742
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:08,010
And we went over that with taxes is 39
percent taxes versus think like nine.

1743
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,630
Um,
however,

1744
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,201
uh,
you know,

1745
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:13,530
I've been there plenty of times and,
and the weed here in southern

1746
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:16,830
California,
it's still past that I've seen possible.

1747
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:20,550
It seems like denver would have the best
climate ever getting it needs to fucking

1748
01:20:20,551 --> 01:20:25,410
relax on those big dick measuring
competition between slates and we were

1749
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:26,780
in pittsburgh.
No,

1750
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:30,540
we were in philly and we got high with
this do to the radio station.

1751
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:33,390
Gave us a joint and we were like some
philly,

1752
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:34,860
we'd,
I'll just smoke the fuck out.

1753
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:38,310
His fellow isn't going to do shit.
And like 20 minutes later we were like,

1754
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,730
dude,
we made a mistake.

1755
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:45,480
PhIlly we'd is legit.
I think there's an answer to that

1756
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:49,260
though,
is that the best weed in Colorado is

1757
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:51,210
still black market.
Um,

1758
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,090
so
maybe.

1759
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:58,290
But
he's so fuckIng strong.

1760
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:00,240
You guys are crazy talk.
This is,

1761
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:03,270
you're talking for the deepest of the
deep and the deep end of the pool.

1762
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,900
That's what you're talking all the pot,
whether it's Colorado or California,

1763
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,290
we'll put you on fucking pluto.
All of it.

1764
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,280
No,
no doubt.

1765
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,520
And the difference between two hits of
Colorado pot,

1766
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:16,560
two hits of California pot is if you can
measure that,

1767
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,940
write a book at the end.
It's the joy you had.

1768
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,950
Like what if you had like three joints?
Those were just the three shittiest

1769
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,750
joints in color.
I don't buy it.

1770
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,030
Colorado.
I was in Colorado.

1771
01:21:27,031 --> 01:21:28,880
I had some other weed.
I'll be there thursday.

1772
01:21:28,890 --> 01:21:33,390
Fucking ridiculous.
It's like it's super weed.

1773
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:36,030
It's all the same shit.
All these strains have gotten

1774
01:21:36,031 --> 01:21:37,430
everywhere.
You know,

1775
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,570
they're all over the country.
They have this shit in New York now.

1776
01:21:39,850 --> 01:21:42,510
Does the.
We do get hired because of the elevation

1777
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:43,561
for weed?
Yeah.

1778
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:45,380
You have no air.
So it's probably just shitty weed.

1779
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:46,021
No,
no,

1780
01:21:46,021 --> 01:21:47,950
no.
The alcohol gets too drunk or too.

1781
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,310
That's a big one.
But uh,

1782
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:51,300
it's,
it's just,

1783
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,760
it's just good.
We're great.

1784
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:54,594
It's everywhere.

1785
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,460
It's because of social media.
It's becoming to a point where you just

1786
01:22:02,161 --> 01:22:04,320
can't deny it.
I thought we were aLready there.

1787
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:09,330
We're very close to it.
And as I'm politicians get older and

1788
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:11,370
pushed out and younger politicians get
in,

1789
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,610
the toothpaste is out of the tube,
it's not going backwards.

1790
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:15,500
So,
uh,

1791
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,740
you know,
for la to be behind the times of the

1792
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:22,800
rest of the state and for California,
the most progressive state in the

1793
01:22:22,801 --> 01:22:27,801
country to be behind the times of states
like Colorado and Alaska who were

1794
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:31,230
making,
making tax money.

1795
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,260
It's the money,
the money and the politics is too.

1796
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,210
It's too intertwined.
It's too,

1797
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,120
it's part of the fabric of our society
and it's broken,

1798
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:40,350
you know,
it is.

1799
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:43,500
And hopefully iT's going to be
eventually pushed out.

1800
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:45,203
But right now,
you know,

1801
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,550
you have to deal with one of the most
ridiculous examples of it,

1802
01:22:47,610 --> 01:22:50,010
which is marijuana.
It's one of the most ridiculous examples

1803
01:22:50,011 --> 01:22:53,850
of all sorts of problems that I'm sure
all sorts of businesses run into all

1804
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:57,630
across the country that we don't
consider because it doesn't play a part

1805
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:59,520
in our lives.
But this one does.

1806
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:02,280
And this one is really a nationwide
freedom issue.

1807
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,320
I mean,
that's really what a lot of is about.

1808
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,130
It's a freedom of consciousness issue.

1809
01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:08,590
And people don't look at it like that.
They will get it.

1810
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:10,600
Like it's law enforcement,
it's this,

1811
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,040
it's crime,
it's this,

1812
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,240
it's children,
it's this,

1813
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:15,110
no,
it's not what it is.

1814
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:20,430
It's a freedom of social consciousness.
It's a freedom of being able to express

1815
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:27,391
yourself and the freedom of being able
to intoxicate yourself with a natural

1816
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:31,930
plant and then what comes out of that.
And that's what everybody was worried

1817
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:34,630
about more than anything in the 19
seventies,

1818
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,300
what they were worried about.
And then a sixties and the seventies is

1819
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:39,820
what was coming out of this.
They weren't worried about the

1820
01:23:39,821 --> 01:23:42,910
consequences of taking this drug.
They were worried about what's coming

1821
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,620
out of this.
You're geTting all these people that

1822
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:48,580
just won't tolerate all the usual
standard shit because they're constantly

1823
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:51,730
resetting themselves and then
reconsidering their environment and

1824
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:56,080
they're coming out with this whole new
movement of people like all the haight

1825
01:23:56,081 --> 01:23:58,720
ashbury shit and the sixties and you
know,

1826
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:00,460
all the,
the music of the time.

1827
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:04,300
So much of That had to do with pot and
so much of that has to do with lsd.

1828
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,190
Sure.
And they were just terrified of that

1829
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:08,140
shit.
They will work when we talk about the

1830
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:12,160
war on drugs and people blame nancy
reagan that started with nixon,

1831
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:13,780
you know,
in the late sixties,

1832
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:16,470
early seventies.
And now the new stuff has come out.

1833
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,300
I'm sure you've seen it where they're
saying the nixon administration

1834
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:22,990
purposely targeted marijuana because
they were really going after the civil

1835
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,270
rights leaders and the people that were
anti war movement.

1836
01:24:25,271 --> 01:24:27,550
Yes.
So they would go arrest them through pot

1837
01:24:27,551 --> 01:24:30,880
and that would be the get the back door
to just break up these organizations and

1838
01:24:30,881 --> 01:24:32,300
that this was a strategy they had

1839
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,540
to the point that they asked a
universities to pull cannabis

1840
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:38,980
information that was positive.
Um,

1841
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:39,810
I,
I mean,

1842
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,643
that's.

1843
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:41,663
Yeah,
they do.

1844
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,320
They funded studies trying to find
things wrong with pot and they all,

1845
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:47,880
all they found was good shit.
The donald tash can study is one that I

1846
01:24:47,881 --> 01:24:51,360
love where he was that study was to find
the connection between lung cancer and

1847
01:24:51,361 --> 01:24:53,670
smoking cannabis.
And it turned out he could find no

1848
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:55,920
connection.
It actually showed that there could be

1849
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:56,843
a,
a,

1850
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:59,820
a protective effect of cannabis.
That's how I'm still alive.

1851
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,260
Maybe a lot of people like you that
smoke cigarettes and smoke pot.

1852
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:06,840
It might actually even started the same
time.

1853
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,130
NO,
I haven't.

1854
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:11,880
I have a patient with double lung
transplant.

1855
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:16,910
He had a
fiber myalgia and myalgia.

1856
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,470
Uh,
so that's double lung transplant.

1857
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:22,080
Uh,
we were doIng an interview with,

1858
01:25:22,081 --> 01:25:22,850
uh,
with,

1859
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:27,850
with a magazine and I had him there and
he showed I take these 45 pills a day

1860
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,890
for four,
you know,

1861
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:34,010
what I have or I could eat these three
edibles and um,

1862
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,860
he's like 45 pills a day.
It's crazy just trying to swallow them.

1863
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:39,180
Um,
and.

1864
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:42,420
But he said these cost me thousands of
dollars,

1865
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:46,020
however I don't pay for them because
it's paid by insurance.

1866
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:51,200
These I pay almost 45,
$50 a day in edibles and,

1867
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,430
and I could just eat those instead.
However,

1868
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:57,420
none of this is paid for it.
And I don't have the money to pay $50 a

1869
01:25:57,421 --> 01:26:01,890
day for my medication.
So he's one of the patients that we help

1870
01:26:01,891 --> 01:26:05,390
out with with a free product and um,
you know,

1871
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:08,020
because he can't afford It

1872
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:12,780
to live pharmaceutical side of the,
of this conversation is just,

1873
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:16,470
that's a whole nother side of it is very
nice of you to give that to him by the

1874
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:19,410
way.
But hearing that he's eaten $45 or the

1875
01:26:19,411 --> 01:26:22,190
edibles day makes me want to shit my
pants and scary.

1876
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:26,100
What kind of a tornado of consciousness,
this guy flying around in all day,

1877
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,150
how many milligrams we talking for 45
bucks worth of weed.

1878
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,610
How many milligrams is this motherfucker
taking in?

1879
01:26:33,100 --> 01:26:35,400
You know,
you have no lungs.

1880
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:38,250
You take whatever you need to do to get
through that day.

1881
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,300
Oh yeah,
we know for sure.

1882
01:26:39,301 --> 01:26:42,870
But I'm thinking $45 where the chiba
chews would put you in another

1883
01:26:42,871 --> 01:26:44,850
dimension.
Come on time.

1884
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:46,980
There's a shit hacky sack.

1885
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:51,860
We're talking somewhere around 500
milligrams a day.

1886
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,660
Um,
so,

1887
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:54,290
so it's not tremendous.
I mean,

1888
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,870
I've seen joey diaz he a thousand
dollars

1889
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:59,090
right time saying,
but if he's getting cheaper,

1890
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:03,260
choose like chiba chews,
which are like a really potent,

1891
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:07,010
an easy way to get them.
40th five bucks is not 500 milligrams.

1892
01:27:07,011 --> 01:27:09,970
You can give one 500 milligram one for a
lot less than that,

1893
01:27:09,971 --> 01:27:11,930
right?
For 15 bucks.

1894
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,710
So spend 45 bucks and he's buying the
good shit.

1895
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:18,800
Jesus louisa's,
he might be on a five,

1896
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,090
500 milligram chiba chew a day diet.
I want to meet this student's shake his

1897
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:24,380
hand.
That's a piece of pioneer.

1898
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,650
Pioneer live in that world.
That's a good man.

1899
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,670
Good man to know.
Whatever.

1900
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:32,750
Don't be a pussy.
All of a sudden you're worried about

1901
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:35,930
sugar.
This fucking guys living in an alternate

1902
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:37,880
dimension.
These are looking at us through a

1903
01:27:37,881 --> 01:27:41,130
fucking aquarium window.
Like he's.

1904
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:44,000
He's not even here if he's eating that
much pot.

1905
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:47,660
You're talking about that much,
that many milligrams and then it's

1906
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:50,390
getting processed.
So you gotta think about it way stronger

1907
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:51,920
than just smoking it,
right?

1908
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:53,240
It is.
I mean,

1909
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:55,700
I went,
I had a bad edible strip and I went five

1910
01:27:55,701 --> 01:27:58,340
years without even touching it,
even though we had him on the menu,

1911
01:27:58,341 --> 01:27:58,761
I was like,
dude,

1912
01:27:58,761 --> 01:28:01,670
I w I wouldn't even want to smell one of
those tootsie rolls or whatever the hell

1913
01:28:01,671 --> 01:28:03,310
it is.
I didn't want nothing to do with it

1914
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,230
because I was in another place for like
two days.

1915
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,000
Hi,
just going,

1916
01:28:08,001 --> 01:28:09,380
when is it going to end?
I mean,

1917
01:28:09,381 --> 01:28:10,180
we started this

1918
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:14,770
an edibles company before,
before we were speed weed and we were

1919
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:17,650
one of the first.
We were the first company to do gummy

1920
01:28:17,651 --> 01:28:20,410
bears and um,
when we were making them,

1921
01:28:20,411 --> 01:28:21,460
um,
you know,

1922
01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:24,220
my brother and my partner with,
with his wife,

1923
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:28,240
jan also has figured out a way to
extract,

1924
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,730
um,
extract thc from,

1925
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,490
from weed.
This is six years ago before anyone was

1926
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:37,720
doing it because we had a failed crop.
Um,

1927
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:40,510
because when I moved to California,
we got our cards.

1928
01:28:40,511 --> 01:28:42,580
I said,
I'm just going to throw up a grow and

1929
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,110
now I'm allowed to grow here.

1930
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:48,000
I'm going to throw up a grow.
Ever heard that I need to start saying

1931
01:28:48,001 --> 01:28:50,130
shit like that.
Get to go with my friends.

1932
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,190
So agent said,
that's great.

1933
01:28:53,191 --> 01:28:55,440
Where are we going to do it?
I said I'm going to do it in your living

1934
01:28:55,441 --> 01:28:57,810
room.
So I took over his living room with

1935
01:28:57,811 --> 01:29:02,130
tents and I put up grown and I think and
since I going back and forth to

1936
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,660
New York selling my house,
I'm a every two weeks he was watching it

1937
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:08,210
while I was gone.
Well it was

1938
01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:11,360
disaster.
It was the worst experience were growing

1939
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,440
pot with all of our money.
And I'm on the phone with gina going,

1940
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,030
you know,
the leaves are yellow.

1941
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:17,750
He's like,
all right,

1942
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,760
are the veins,
read them and what do I don't know what

1943
01:29:19,761 --> 01:29:22,390
we're talking about because It needs
more responsible motherfucker.

1944
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,140
You can't just leave this dude with your
plans.

1945
01:29:24,380 --> 01:29:24,990
He's like,
go,

1946
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:26,890
go get more nitrogen.
I'm like,

1947
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,150
hi baby.
For me,

1948
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,710
take my baby.
Just feed it when it cries.

1949
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,700
So I,
I got,

1950
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:32,300
I got

1951
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,970
back from,
from a trip late leading into my,

1952
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:35,771
my,
uh,

1953
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:40,130
a growth cycle and I opened it up and
you see webs,

1954
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:43,550
well those aren't spiders,
those are spider mites and that's the

1955
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:45,590
worst thing you could ever,
ever get.

1956
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,890
I grew in Ohio last,
my whole entire crop spit like months

1957
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:51,620
growing,
this scared of helicopters with a heat

1958
01:29:51,621 --> 01:29:55,940
seeking thing and all our money was sunk
into this,

1959
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,530
um,
you know,

1960
01:29:57,531 --> 01:30:01,280
all of a four months time to make it
happen.

1961
01:30:01,281 --> 01:30:02,540
And I was just defeated.
I was like,

1962
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,430
I can't believe it.
What are we gonna do?

1963
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,070
And so we,
we had the fight it to fight those

1964
01:30:07,071 --> 01:30:09,320
spider mites.
We did everything we could,

1965
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:13,970
including buying 10,000 ladybugs which
eat these things and releasing them in

1966
01:30:13,971 --> 01:30:16,160
this tent.
A foot from where I'm sleeping on his

1967
01:30:16,161 --> 01:30:16,620
couch.

1968
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,440
I bought them on amazon.
I bought like a zillion lady bugs on

1969
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:21,870
amazon.
We just released them into my living

1970
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:22,320
room.
Yeah,

1971
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,420
we buy them all the time.
Yeah.

1972
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,880
They didn't even do a bunch of different
plants that are girls.

1973
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:28,780
So we bought ladybugs.

1974
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:30,170
Yeah.
And they worked.

1975
01:30:30,171 --> 01:30:33,290
But they didn't exactly work fast enough
and they were dying because we're.

1976
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:36,230
And uh,
so we had to get predator mites,

1977
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:40,250
which were other little creepy crawly
things that we had to release right

1978
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:42,670
where I was sleeping.
So we released it.

1979
01:30:42,970 --> 01:30:43,803
It was,
it,

1980
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:44,960
it's exactly what it was.

1981
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,950
It was like,
if you could look at it under a

1982
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:48,120
microscope,
it would be alert,

1983
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:51,300
some sort of a fucking storm troopers,
starship troopers,

1984
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,420
you know,
a lord of the rings.

1985
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:56,770
Things were flying down,
eating each other things with crime and

1986
01:30:56,771 --> 01:30:57,770
up.
And they were like,

1987
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,340
so what happened?
What's the long story?

1988
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,141
So,
so,

1989
01:31:00,141 --> 01:31:02,790
so we got rid of them and had had bad
weed.

1990
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,560
We extracted it,
had re read some papers online.

1991
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,110
We extract and I said,
what are we going to do with this?

1992
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:08,460
And we said,
all right,

1993
01:31:08,461 --> 01:31:10,620
let's make some edibles.
So his wife,

1994
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,910
so hold on,
it's bad.

1995
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:13,721
Weed,
bad.

1996
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:16,130
We'd consider it because you can't smoke
it.

1997
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,930
Yeah.
But you can still turn into edibles.

1998
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:19,470
It,
it looked like shit out of,

1999
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,640
out of the litter box.
It was garbage bin geno's like fuck it,

2000
01:31:22,641 --> 01:31:24,350
I'm smoking it mode.
I'm confused.

2001
01:31:24,351 --> 01:31:27,050
Explain like why did it look bad?
Because the mites chewed it up.

2002
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:27,893
Like what?

2003
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:31,490
Yeah,
a lady bug with a lady bug wings.

2004
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,910
Here's the thing.
Really.

2005
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,290
So,
so there's also things called neem oil,

2006
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:40,040
which is a natural pesticide that that
also helps in killing,

2007
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:41,360
killing these things.
However,

2008
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:45,170
in a growth cycle you shouldn't use it
near the end because then it's going to

2009
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:46,850
be on the flowers that you have to
smoke.

2010
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,490
However,
if you extract the thc out of it,

2011
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,580
it's no longer on that plant material.
You're getting rid of the plant

2012
01:31:52,581 --> 01:31:55,550
material.
The neem oil that's on it won't

2013
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,660
translate into an excel.

2014
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:57,701
Oh,
okay.

2015
01:31:57,701 --> 01:32:00,310
So you use the pesticide unfortunately,

2016
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,870
late in the cycle and it made the pot
bad to smoke,

2017
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:04,920
but you can still extract the thc from.
Right,

2018
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,070
right.
It's a natural oil.

2019
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:06,590
I,
I,

2020
01:32:06,590 --> 01:32:07,081
it,
it,

2021
01:32:07,081 --> 01:32:09,820
it works as a pesticide.
But I was so baffled.

2022
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,230
I was like,
how is it bad weed?

2023
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:12,430
And then it's good weed.
So,

2024
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,710
so bad.
We'd good gummy bears.

2025
01:32:14,770 --> 01:32:15,350
Yeah.
So.

2026
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:16,720
Oh,
so I started going,

2027
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:20,350
what is the process of extracting thc
from the flowers?

2028
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,290
It's like breaking bad.
Is that it?

2029
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:25,330
Yeah.
My kitchen looked like a meth lab for

2030
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,380
like three months is crazy.
We had a sox.

2031
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,540
Lydia,
you had to have you done this before

2032
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,900
where you were experimenting?
Did you watch a youtube video?

2033
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:36,990
I had no idea it even existed.
I found a paper from like 1976 or ucla

2034
01:32:37,601 --> 01:32:40,030
scientists that multi solvent extraction
academy.

2035
01:32:40,031 --> 01:32:41,690
Middle age.
You can find it online now.

2036
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,190
Like this is a how to manual and how to
do extraction.

2037
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:45,761
Okay.
Hold on.

2038
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:48,700
Neither one of you guys are scientists.
We're technology guys.

2039
01:32:48,710 --> 01:32:50,440
I got scientists,
right?

2040
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:53,090
I know I got married.
No,

2041
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:57,550
I'm techie at homework.
Had you ever done any chemical work like

2042
01:32:57,551 --> 01:33:01,000
that?
Using solvents and extracting l elements

2043
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:04,000
from plants?
Not professionally.

2044
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:05,470
He age is humble.
He,

2045
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:07,150
he's a,
he's a member of mensa.

2046
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:11,050
Uh,
I got very blessed to have a brother

2047
01:33:11,051 --> 01:33:13,930
who's very intelligent,
um,

2048
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:16,270
you know,
so I was just defeated,

2049
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:18,310
you know,
I got a bad crop.

2050
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:20,110
I wasted all oUr money.
I wasted our time.

2051
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:25,620
He turned lemons into lemonade because
luckily he's smart enough to say what

2052
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:29,560
else can we do with this?
And he went out and found a way for us

2053
01:33:29,830 --> 01:33:30,663
to.

2054
01:33:30,750 --> 01:33:33,190
Did you practice or do you just dive
right in?

2055
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:34,600
Would you do this?
I hadn't.

2056
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:36,760
It was like a six week r and d process.
So.

2057
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,460
So we did the extraction through with,
uh,

2058
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,160
all kinds of different chemicals,
right?

2059
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,430
Ultimately ethanol worked really well
and then every night at 11 I would give

2060
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:49,300
gino a dose,
like on a cookie or something at 11 and

2061
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:54,301
then I would wait 45 minutes in a mocked
up in your basement to pretty much keep

2062
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:02,140
it rubs the lotion on skin every night.
And then finally one day I give gina the

2063
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:03,580
dose,
1145,

2064
01:34:03,581 --> 01:34:04,630
is that how you feel?
He goes,

2065
01:34:04,631 --> 01:34:06,010
I don't think it's working.
I was like,

2066
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:06,851
boom,
that's it.

2067
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:08,770
That's the recipe.
And it's in my journal.

2068
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:12,910
And that was kind of how we got into the
industry was with that extraction

2069
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:13,930
process,
that recipe,

2070
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:16,360
that day.
Now I've always wondered like this,

2071
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:21,070
when you use all those chemicals and you
extract something from a plant or those

2072
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:24,610
chemicals in any way,
is there a residue on the extraction?

2073
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:27,220
Depends.
We were using ethanol which is alcohol,

2074
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:30,130
but then we were making candy which
burns off the alcohol,

2075
01:34:30,370 --> 01:34:35,370
so there's no alcohol in the candy,
but now you have the thc which is inside

2076
01:34:36,011 --> 01:34:38,830
the candy and now you can and now we
would.

2077
01:34:38,850 --> 01:34:43,030
We would do car box relating the flower
before anybody was doing that and what

2078
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:47,170
that means is you activate the flower,
like you can't just take bud and eat it

2079
01:34:47,171 --> 01:34:48,400
and get stoned.
It won't work.

2080
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:51,820
Why is that?
Because you need something fat soluble.

2081
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:55,360
You need to convert it to thc acid.
So you do that with heat,

2082
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:57,980
so you smoke it or you do that with fat

2083
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,170
like lipids.
You boil it and butter.

2084
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:02,120
Make brownies,
so fuck.

2085
01:35:02,121 --> 01:35:04,670
Did people figure that out?
It's brilliant.

2086
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:06,800
It's genius.
Or you could do it with alcohol and

2087
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:09,230
that's ultimately what we'll use is
alcohol extracts.

2088
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:11,600
Butane works as well,
but what I mean is how the fuck did

2089
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:15,500
people figure out that you had to burn
it in order to use it because they're

2090
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,140
probably eating it long before they knew
I could get your high.

2091
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,020
Well,
I mean it civilizations amazing.

2092
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:23,000
Like how did they figure out if we eat
this route?

2093
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:26,190
Iowasca works,
but otherwise or nut trees doesn't,

2094
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,250
you know,
the trees told us

2095
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,790
that was probably true.
They use tobacco in those iowasca

2096
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,200
rituals apparently.
Right.

2097
01:35:36,201 --> 01:35:40,520
We're right before you go onto their
blow tobacco smoke on your face and was

2098
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,200
just to get you ready to vomit.
Well,

2099
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:43,250
I don't even know if it's that.

2100
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,390
I think it's a stimulating effect of the
nicotine has some sort of a kickstart

2101
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:49,610
like terence mckenna,
when he would take mushrooms,

2102
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:51,770
what he would do is he would take them
and then you would wait.

2103
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,940
They kick in like an hour or so.
So while he was waiting for them to kick

2104
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:58,730
in,
he was just rolled joints as motherfuck

2105
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:03,731
would roll joints for an hour and then
and then go and start going and when the

2106
01:36:06,321 --> 01:36:08,780
pot really kicked in,
like when he would get really,

2107
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:10,940
really high,
that would be right when the mushrooms

2108
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:14,900
had come in like a giant tidal wave and
he said he could see it coming,

2109
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,860
he could see it coming,
you could feel it in the ground and it

2110
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:21,710
seemed like there's no way no one else
is experiencing this.

2111
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:26,480
It's just like this gigantic wave is
coming and there's nothing you can do to

2112
01:36:26,481 --> 01:36:27,314
stop it.

2113
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,930
And that's how he would do it.
So he would use marijuana smoke,

2114
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,850
just sort of instigate the,
uh,

2115
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:34,460
the mushroom experience,
which totally makes sense.

2116
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:39,110
But that's a warrior that it will do
that kind of experimentation dive dude,

2117
01:36:39,111 --> 01:36:41,690
when deep healing deep,
he went deep,

2118
01:36:41,691 --> 01:36:43,670
maybe two months.
She died of a brain cancer,

2119
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,880
a brain tumor.
I mean,

2120
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:49,400
who knows if that was hereditary,
who knows what that was,

2121
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:53,150
you know,
it related in a way to expanding

2122
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,130
consciousness.
We're attempting to expand in

2123
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:56,570
consciousness through drugs,
most likely,

2124
01:36:56,571 --> 01:36:58,910
not especially,
but he was really critical of the idea

2125
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:02,480
that marijuana was cure a cure for
cancer because he was like,

2126
01:37:02,481 --> 01:37:04,490
look,
I am telling you I have cancer and I

2127
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:07,160
smoked pot all day constantly.
He's like,

2128
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:11,480
I am yoUr poster boy,
because if it was something that cured

2129
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:13,220
cancer,
I would not have cancer because you

2130
01:37:13,221 --> 01:37:16,700
cannot smoke more pot than me.
Like mckenna was just high all day.

2131
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:20,480
But there's so many different cancers
and so many different types of weed.

2132
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:22,280
Who knows what's what.
We got to research.

2133
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,200
Well,
I think what's really supposed to be the

2134
01:37:24,201 --> 01:37:27,230
most effectIve and chino you help my
friend when he,

2135
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:29,750
uh,
his mom had an Issue with this and this

2136
01:37:29,751 --> 01:37:32,900
is something about genome who'd never
advertised himself,

2137
01:37:32,901 --> 01:37:37,700
but he hooked my friend up with a lot of
this cannabis oil.

2138
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:41,540
What's really expensive stuff and you
did it just to help his mom,

2139
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:43,970
but just to help his dad rather.

2140
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:45,620
Well,
he's a good dude.

2141
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,150
And uh,
you know,

2142
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,930
we were talking about stage four cancer
at that point.

2143
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:56,350
So there wasn't much a ever hope that it
was going to turn around and cure it.

2144
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,590
However,
to ease the last few months of life,

2145
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,610
um,
was,

2146
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:08,780
was working and happening there,
there was a lot more quality of life,

2147
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,170
which for the patient that,
that was great,

2148
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,900
number one,
absolute most important,

2149
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:19,170
but also for our,
our friend that we're talking about,

2150
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:24,410
it was great for him because he got the
last few months of life together with

2151
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:29,790
his loved one in a better way,
not in a comatose a setting,

2152
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:34,050
which he was dealing with for a while
before we got got,

2153
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:34,960
uh,
you know,

2154
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,720
uh,
on the,

2155
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,110
uh,
rick simpson oil regimen.

2156
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:39,010
Well,
it definitely needs to be investigAted

2157
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:42,940
because there's so many people that have
had beneficial effects from it.

2158
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,230
It just seems insane to not have some
large scale scientific research being

2159
01:38:47,231 --> 01:38:49,870
done right now.
Like just humanity as a whole.

2160
01:38:49,871 --> 01:38:52,900
Like we kind of owe it to each other.
Like if you,

2161
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:55,030
you're not thinking about it right now
because your loved ones don't have

2162
01:38:55,031 --> 01:38:56,740
cancer.
But if this turns out to be really

2163
01:38:56,741 --> 01:38:59,740
legit,
this could be another reason why we need

2164
01:38:59,741 --> 01:39:04,741
to reconsider this whole ban on the
illegal sale federally of marijuana.

2165
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:09,270
It's ridiculous if it can do this.
If you really taking this oil and you're

2166
01:39:09,271 --> 01:39:12,640
reduce reducing tumors,
which has been reported in just a

2167
01:39:12,641 --> 01:39:15,130
shitload of people,
including friends of mine.

2168
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:18,790
I know people that have had cancer and
had their cancer reduced by taking

2169
01:39:18,791 --> 01:39:23,200
cannabis oil and I know people whose
parents had it and got their.

2170
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,190
Their tumors reduced because of it and
autistic kids like the caesars and stuff

2171
01:39:27,191 --> 01:39:29,860
like that.
our friend and his kid was going from

2172
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:31,660
like.
I mean he was having seizures all day.

2173
01:39:31,670 --> 01:39:33,570
takes this stuff.
He hasn't had a seizure in six months.

2174
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,850
You look at jaden and and charlotte and
ali's,

2175
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:38,110
these kids.
How caN you.

2176
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:40,000
How can you tell the parents?
No,

2177
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:41,650
exactly.
no matter what state you're in,

2178
01:39:41,651 --> 01:39:43,030
how can you tell a parent know?
And that's.

2179
01:39:43,031 --> 01:39:45,220
I think that's when your politics
changed and when it affects you

2180
01:39:45,221 --> 01:39:47,020
personally.
It definitely happens.

2181
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:49,600
It definitely happens and I've seen
quite a few stories of that,

2182
01:39:49,601 --> 01:39:51,520
of people that have children that have,
you know,

2183
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:55,390
serious seizure issues and as soon as
they got them on the medical marijuana

2184
01:39:55,391 --> 01:39:59,950
and just stopped and we have a lot of
really bad prejudices about marijuana

2185
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,600
and we need to expose them like as a
society because they're holding a lot of

2186
01:40:04,601 --> 01:40:05,434
people back.

2187
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:09,160
I know they held me back.
They made me until I was 30 years old.

2188
01:40:09,161 --> 01:40:11,250
I thought that was for idiots.
So it really did.

2189
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:15,250
a lot of people do and it's,
it's important to let them know.

2190
01:40:15,251 --> 01:40:17,600
Not only is it not for idiots,
it's,

2191
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:19,840
it's,
it's a tool that you can use it,

2192
01:40:20,230 --> 01:40:21,790
you can,
it can benefit you.

2193
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:25,090
Like this is not a benign substance.
It's slippery,

2194
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:28,120
you know,
like all other psychoactive substances,

2195
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:32,650
if you are on the wrong path mentally,
like you could go off the deep end with

2196
01:40:32,651 --> 01:40:33,820
it,
like everything else,

2197
01:40:33,821 --> 01:40:35,350
like alcohol or anything else.
But

2198
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:38,910
someone who I respect a lot like graham
hancock,

2199
01:40:38,911 --> 01:40:43,911
who have you had on the show a lot.
He was a high heavy user and he got to a

2200
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:45,294
point,
um,

2201
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,130
where he said,
you know what,

2202
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:50,280
my relationship is not good with
marijuana anymore.

2203
01:40:50,281 --> 01:40:53,830
And he took a long break,
I think two to three years.

2204
01:40:54,580 --> 01:40:57,550
He took a long break and then said,
you know what,

2205
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:01,390
things have changed in my life now.
I think I could go back and have that

2206
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:04,960
relationShip start again.
And from what I,

2207
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:08,110
what I understand mostly from the
podcast,

2208
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:08,770
uh,
from,

2209
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:11,590
from him being on the podcast last time,
um,

2210
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:15,970
he is now in a better relationship with
marijuana

2211
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,870
that he was in an abusive relationship
with himself.

2212
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,300
And marijuana was just playing a factor
in that.

2213
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:22,800
Sure.
I'm the one who got them high.

2214
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:23,631
Yeah.
I got,

2215
01:41:23,631 --> 01:41:26,970
I'm behind on the show when he was a.
Who was it took two or three years

2216
01:41:26,971 --> 01:41:27,481
sober.
I'm like,

2217
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:28,730
too,
you're fine.

2218
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:32,210
Just come on.
You're the smartest dude ever.

2219
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:35,370
He loved it.
And he and he opened up when I,

2220
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,540
when I gave it to him,
oh my god.

2221
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:39,870
They opened up like a flower who took
one hit and then he relaxed and he was

2222
01:41:39,871 --> 01:41:43,440
smiling and laughing.
We're having a good time and he went on

2223
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:45,420
this rant.
Oh my god.

2224
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:47,970
It was epic rant,
epic rant,

2225
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:50,610
and I remember thinking like,
wow,

2226
01:41:50,611 --> 01:41:55,380
that had to be cannabis inspired because
it was so like emotionally connected to

2227
01:41:55,381 --> 01:41:58,020
him.
There was essentially like sort of

2228
01:41:58,021 --> 01:42:02,850
validating his life work because he was
really heavily criticized many,

2229
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:07,851
many times where people just completely
ignored any of the potentially positive

2230
01:42:08,911 --> 01:42:12,600
aspects of what he was saying and just
was trying to shit on all they're trying

2231
01:42:12,601 --> 01:42:16,020
to shit on all of these theories,
but as time has gone on,

2232
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:19,200
it's been more and more apparent that he
was right the whole time.

2233
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,180
That's all different thingS that just
studies.

2234
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,640
Yeah.
Well the big one being that

2235
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:28,170
civilizations have experienced many
diFferent areas and that will.

2236
01:42:28,171 --> 01:42:31,680
We're looking at when we looked back,
thousands and thousands of years is the

2237
01:42:31,681 --> 01:42:35,910
most latest of arrows,
but there was potentially very advanced

2238
01:42:35,911 --> 01:42:38,880
civilizations that had a different kind
of advancement.

2239
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:41,340
Ten thousand,
15,000 years,

2240
01:42:41,341 --> 01:42:45,150
maybe as many as 30,000 years ago,
and that there's evidence of this stuff.

2241
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:48,360
There's evidence in the construction of
the old kingdom in Egypt.

2242
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:52,380
There's evidence when they start looking
at certain erosion patterns on the

2243
01:42:52,381 --> 01:42:54,990
sphinx and the sphinx compound like
you're talking about,

2244
01:42:54,991 --> 01:42:58,650
like something that was built 14,000
years ago plus.

2245
01:42:58,651 --> 01:43:02,160
So all these different new discoveries
that they're having when they're having

2246
01:43:02,161 --> 01:43:04,140
these new there find these new things
that are like four.

2247
01:43:04,170 --> 01:43:09,170
They found evidence of north americans
in a native americans in north America

2248
01:43:09,661 --> 01:43:12,960
at 14,000 years ago,
which pushes it way back before they

2249
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:13,790
thought it was.

2250
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:16,650
They found like woolly mammoth bones
with cuts on them and shit super

2251
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:19,200
recently.
So this stuff keeps happening over and

2252
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:22,710
over again and they keep discovering
these structures and you know,

2253
01:43:22,711 --> 01:43:26,620
they find things underwater.
They find sunken cities and shit go back

2254
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,580
later and yeah,
exactly.

2255
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:33,000
Can carbon date stone.
So that's why I go back to the so unique

2256
01:43:33,001 --> 01:43:37,500
because they know that it was covered up
somewhere around 12,000 years ago.

2257
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,160
Purposely.
Someone constructed this thing sometime

2258
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,860
before that they,
you know,

2259
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:46,220
they get a vague idea within a thousand
years of when this thing was built and

2260
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:48,450
it was built when they thought people
were hunter gatherers,

2261
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:50,670
so this is all stuff that hancock had
already been saying,

2262
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:54,620
so to see him get high and just expand
upon that and see like this is a guy

2263
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:58,610
that like he's been ridiculed,
he's been dragged through the mud people

2264
01:43:58,611 --> 01:44:02,240
have taken what you've said out of
context and tried to use it against him.

2265
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:06,800
They've had these really biased opinions
about his Work and they've made little

2266
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:11,210
specials about it to shitting on him and
it turns out he was right about a lot of

2267
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:14,690
things and it's just gathering evidence
and then making,

2268
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:17,440
making his his thoughts and processes
on,

2269
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:21,620
on evidence and he's a really good guy.
Like he doesn't deserve any of that.

2270
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,540
He's not a,
he's not a bad guy.

2271
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:27,590
Like he's a really good guy that's taken
a chance that's exploring this really

2272
01:44:27,591 --> 01:44:31,430
important subject.
This idea that we've been here many

2273
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:33,950
times.
I can remember reading magicians,

2274
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:36,890
magicians of the gods or fingerprints
that his first,

2275
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,320
first one thinking things,
footprints of the gods,

2276
01:44:39,321 --> 01:44:40,280
right?
Wasn't fingerprints,

2277
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:42,320
no fingerprints or your parents.
I'm thinking,

2278
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:45,350
thank god there's a dude out there.
I didn't know who he was at the time.

2279
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:49,100
Thank god there's someone doing this
work because I had never heard of any of

2280
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:49,934
this before.

2281
01:44:49,940 --> 01:44:51,110
I read that book.
Well,

2282
01:44:51,111 --> 01:44:55,310
there's been a bunch of similar like
theorists in the past,

2283
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:57,290
but they always connected it to like
aliens,

2284
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:01,160
like specifically like zachariah
hitchins such and such and stuff.

2285
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:01,800
Yeah.
Well he.

2286
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:04,730
He was gonna bring up that guy from the
chariots of the gods.

2287
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:08,720
What the fuck Is that guy's name?
There was a dude,

2288
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:13,870
von danIken von daniken who wrote
chariots of the gods and a chair to the

2289
01:45:14,431 --> 01:45:17,180
gods was like a movie.
They made a documentary movie about it

2290
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:19,490
that played in the movie theaters.
I remember when I was a kid,

2291
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:22,610
it was playing in the movie theaters and
I was freaking out and people would

2292
01:45:22,611 --> 01:45:24,260
leave there though to go,
oh my god,

2293
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,320
there's aliens.
They visited us like that movie.

2294
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:29,600
If you watch that movie and you smoke
pot and you're young,

2295
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:33,440
it will have a fucking convinced you
will be fucking convinced.

2296
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,520
One hundred percent.
I feel like I was convinced and it's a

2297
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:41,180
lot of graham hancock who unconvinced me
by,

2298
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:43,400
um,
because a lot of people think he's part

2299
01:45:43,401 --> 01:45:45,950
of the ancient alien theorists,
but he's not really.

2300
01:45:45,951 --> 01:45:49,190
He just feels that,
that we have lost technology.

2301
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:51,140
Well,
he leaves the door open.

2302
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:55,070
We've had conversations about it.
He leaves the door open for visitation.

2303
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:59,750
He leaves the door open for that being a
possibility as do why I think everybody

2304
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:04,751
should have a unique moment where an
alien spacecraft came down and ran into

2305
01:46:04,911 --> 01:46:09,140
14th century europeans and fucked with
them and you know,

2306
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:12,650
and kidnapped a few and did some science
certificate experiments on some and

2307
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:16,070
erase their memories.
you see that of course that could

2308
01:46:16,071 --> 01:46:17,090
happen.
I mean,

2309
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:20,690
if we can go tomorrow so we could send a
robot to zoom around on mars and we

2310
01:46:20,691 --> 01:46:22,970
watch it on her iphone,
we can do that right now.

2311
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:24,590
We're idiots.
We're idiots.

2312
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:26,990
We can't even make pot legal.
You've got a robot moving around on

2313
01:46:26,991 --> 01:46:29,120
mars.
The idea that there's something out

2314
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:31,400
there that's there's no way.
No one is smarter than us.

2315
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:33,980
Dude can't happen.
Like of course there's could be.

2316
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:37,370
If we stay alive for a thousand years,
our technology is going to be

2317
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:40,340
unrecognizable.
It's going to be so beyond anything we

2318
01:46:40,341 --> 01:46:43,790
could possibly imagine today.
Just looking how far it's come since we

2319
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:47,330
were kids growing up an eighties.
These things that we see these,

2320
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:51,810
these things that everybody sees iconic
gray creatures with the big black eyes.

2321
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:56,850
Those could be drones percent.
I mean those could be artificially

2322
01:46:56,851 --> 01:47:01,200
intelligent creatures that some super
advanced civilization has created to

2323
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:05,820
gather up information on people that's
totally possible and that would,

2324
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:10,090
that would make it so much easier for
them to defy the laws of physics to

2325
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:10,400
five.

2326
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:12,240
The laws,
the laws of physics,

2327
01:47:12,430 --> 01:47:14,860
the laws of,
of space travel,

2328
01:47:14,861 --> 01:47:19,861
like with human beings being unable to
withstand the kind of pressure that it

2329
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:22,920
would require to go light speed and shit
like that.

2330
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:27,430
These things are some fucking weird
robot creation that doesn't even exist.

2331
01:47:27,431 --> 01:47:29,760
You know,
lives off of a lithium ion battery.

2332
01:47:29,761 --> 01:47:31,310
It's gotten it's dick,
you know that,

2333
01:47:31,311 --> 01:47:33,600
that,
that thing might be able to go forever,

2334
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:35,820
like it might.
Radiation might not bother it.

2335
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,610
You might be able to shoot it into a
fucking black hole and it comes out the

2336
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:39,540
other side.
I mean,

2337
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:42,840
who knows what the fuck they can do a
million years from now.

2338
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:45,560
Right.
Because in the avatar is just a robot.

2339
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,750
When you all know robots at this point
can be controlled from a remote control.

2340
01:47:50,751 --> 01:47:51,590
Yeah.
We,

2341
01:47:51,591 --> 01:47:53,810
it just depends how far away is that
remote control,

2342
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:55,730
you know,
where is that written in your control?

2343
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:59,400
So the chariots of the gods guy and even
the people that the ancient aliens guys

2344
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:03,540
that who the fuck knows there might have
been a bunch of visitors.

2345
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:07,170
It's very possible.
It's super possible if we can do it,

2346
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:11,040
of course something out there that's
smarter than us can do it better than we

2347
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:15,050
could for sure of course.
But with graham hancock is proposing is

2348
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:18,350
much more likely because it's backed by
actual science and now that he's,

2349
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,900
he's joined efforts with that randall
carlson guy and randall carson,

2350
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:24,570
who's an expert on asteroidal impacts
and it's,

2351
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:28,140
it's the,
the history of them in north America in

2352
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:30,210
the world.
I mean he's a wizard when it comes to

2353
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:33,480
that stuff and he can just quoted off
the top of his head all these different

2354
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,820
impact sites that they found and you
realize like,

2355
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,550
oh geez,
we can hit all the time and not only do

2356
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:41,520
we get hit all the time,
there's evidence of a massive meteor

2357
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:46,521
shower impacting asia and europe
somewhere around 10,000 plus years ago,

2358
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,920
which coincides with the civilization
that they.

2359
01:48:50,050 --> 01:48:54,060
Exactly they're talking about.
So somewhere around that era,

2360
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:57,690
the human race got fucking basically
half wiped out.

2361
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:00,420
Yeah.
We had a rebuild and we don't remember.

2362
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:03,480
We didn't have,
there's no electronics back then.

2363
01:49:03,481 --> 01:49:05,900
So there's no like computers that we
could look at.

2364
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,740
There's no photos.
They didn't have photographs,

2365
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:11,550
they were just basing on people's
memories and things that they could

2366
01:49:11,551 --> 01:49:11,941
draw.
I mean,

2367
01:49:11,941 --> 01:49:13,680
as far as we know,
they didn't have any cameras.

2368
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:14,543
I mean,
who knows.

2369
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:16,200
I mean all that stuff.
If you,

2370
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:18,990
if you had a camera and you left it on
the ground for a thousand years,

2371
01:49:19,110 --> 01:49:22,670
there'd be nothing left and 100 they
would all go away.

2372
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:25,230
It had batteries back then.
They had something like a bat.

2373
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:26,083
They did.
Yeah.

2374
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:27,990
Yeah.
And they found that in one of the

2375
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:30,380
egyptian tombs,
and they found it in Iraq to yet the

2376
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:33,840
little copper and the clay,
they had some kind of computer or

2377
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:35,960
electronics that just doesn't exist
anymore.

2378
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:38,130
Not only that,
the people who made that battery,

2379
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:43,131
they're pretty sure that was 2,500 bc.
So that was way later than this impact.

2380
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:46,260
They're talking about this 11,000,
whatever it was,

2381
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:49,840
year impact.
They think that there's been a series of

2382
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:53,350
these all throughout history and this is
something that's supported by even

2383
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:56,410
mainstream science when they're talking
about super volcanoes.

2384
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:59,920
There's this one super volcano.
We've looked this up three fucking

2385
01:49:59,921 --> 01:50:02,110
times.
I can ever remember this goddamned gino

2386
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:03,970
la speed.
We'd bullshit.

2387
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:07,120
Um,
but there's a super volcano that erupted

2388
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:12,121
70,000 years ago and killed almost
everyone on the planet except for a

2389
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:16,810
couple thousand people and we all
descend from those few thousand people

2390
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:20,260
that survived some massive,
super volcano impact.

2391
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:25,470
This is a really openly accepted theory
and mainstream archeology and

2392
01:50:26,651 --> 01:50:29,320
anthropology.
They really believed that this is one of

2393
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:34,270
the possibly one of the big disaster
extinction events that happened to human

2394
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:34,670
beings.

2395
01:50:34,670 --> 01:50:36,270
There's been several of them,
right?

2396
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:38,590
I know what you're talking about.
That's something that caused like three

2397
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:41,320
or four years of an equivalent of a
nuclear winter.

2398
01:50:41,770 --> 01:50:42,101
Well,
here,

2399
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:44,260
look at it this way.
You remember mount st helen's when we

2400
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:45,370
were kids.
Remember that?

2401
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:48,640
Nobody talks about that.
Nobody even thinks about that anymore.

2402
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:51,580
When we were kids,
a fucking volcano in Washington state

2403
01:50:51,581 --> 01:50:54,760
erupted and people died.
They got lava.

2404
01:50:55,930 --> 01:51:00,930
They got smoked by a volcano,
ash for a month in mash for months,

2405
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:05,530
and it just conveniently goes away.
That was a little baby volcano.

2406
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:07,600
I mean,
obviously no disrespect to anybody who

2407
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:08,540
died,
right?

2408
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:12,970
In comparison to what yellowstone has.
Yellowstone as a super volcano that's

2409
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:17,560
600 miles wide,
something fucking crazy like that.

2410
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:20,530
I mean that's still,
you know,

2411
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:25,060
they don't Call it acted that volcano,
but it's still bubbling.

2412
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:27,580
Well,
they have thousands of earthquakes every

2413
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:27,670
year.

2414
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,090
Thousands.
Like so you know,

2415
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:32,110
shit's going on down there.
The guys yours are shooting up boiling

2416
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:35,490
water and the sulfur content in the
water.

2417
01:51:35,491 --> 01:51:38,140
It's crazy.
Maybe it's 600 kilometers,

2418
01:51:38,690 --> 01:51:40,150
600 kilometers,
300 miles,

2419
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:41,980
whatever it is.
It's so big that it's,

2420
01:51:41,981 --> 01:51:45,340
it's a continent killer right there.
Like when that thing blows everything

2421
01:51:45,341 --> 01:51:49,600
near it is dead as fuck it.
What it is is what they call a caldera,

2422
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:52,360
which means that it's a volcano that was
so big.

2423
01:51:52,361 --> 01:51:56,650
The top blew off of it and then you're
left with this big crater and they

2424
01:51:56,651 --> 01:51:59,680
didn't realize that until they started
using sas satellite images.

2425
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:02,380
Once they started using [inaudible],
we've known about old faithful,

2426
01:52:02,381 --> 01:52:04,080
you know,
that's it's a cool place to visit and go

2427
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:09,090
check out the geysers and stuff that
sets the ground is boiling like 100 feet

2428
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:14,431
below you is hot lava and every six,
800,000 years that shit blow sky high

2429
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,940
and when it blow sky high,
everyone's dead.

2430
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,210
We're all dead.
We're all dead and California is dead.

2431
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:24,700
Montana's dead as fuck.
Everything around.

2432
01:52:24,701 --> 01:52:27,370
It's just dead.
It's depressing because it really is

2433
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:29,680
just a matter of time before there's
some,

2434
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:34,350
some impact or earthquake or a volcano.
It's just a matter of time and which

2435
01:52:34,351 --> 01:52:35,184
ones,
what's it going to be?

2436
01:52:35,200 --> 01:52:36,430
Well,
what graham hancock,

2437
01:52:36,431 --> 01:52:40,000
because exposing is that when you're
talking about enormous periods of time,

2438
01:52:40,270 --> 01:52:42,580
like 10,000 years,
12,000 years,

2439
01:52:42,581 --> 01:52:46,310
30,000 years,
people cannot recall those natural

2440
01:52:46,311 --> 01:52:48,560
disasters.
They lose the ability to communicate.

2441
01:52:48,561 --> 01:52:50,870
Sometimes they're not even using the
same languages anymore.

2442
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,990
You're dealing with thousands and
thousands and thousands of years.

2443
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:56,540
I mean,
just think about just a few thousand

2444
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,460
years ago,
latin was like a real language,

2445
01:52:58,740 --> 01:52:59,240
you know,
joe,

2446
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:01,370
go try finding someone that going to
talk latin for,

2447
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,110
you know,
that shit doesn't it?

2448
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,180
It's a dead language.
It's,

2449
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:08,090
you know,
that's only a couple thousand years when

2450
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:12,140
you're talking about 30,000 years and
the possibility of all these different

2451
01:53:12,141 --> 01:53:15,140
impacts and different things happening
within those 30,000 years.

2452
01:53:15,660 --> 01:53:18,890
Like who knows.
So what he's showing is where would he

2453
01:53:18,891 --> 01:53:22,940
was showing back then was that this
alternative theory is not preposterous

2454
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:24,400
at all.
Like there's,

2455
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:28,970
there's real good evidence that this is
not gonna stay like this,

2456
01:53:28,990 --> 01:53:29,300
right?

2457
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:34,300
Like it's just not preposterous.
It's probable and likely that it's just

2458
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:37,310
what's next.
Will old faithful was called old

2459
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:42,311
faithful because it used to be faithful
and blow at the exact time.

2460
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:47,120
It doesn't do that anymore.
It's no longer on the old faithful type

2461
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:50,660
of a schedule that it,
that it used to be changing.

2462
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:52,230
I don't like that on that air.
I don't like.

2463
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:53,720
It makes me nervous.
I don't like that,

2464
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:54,890
you kNow?
And that's just in our life.

2465
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,640
When did that stop?
I only recently heard it heard that,

2466
01:53:58,730 --> 01:53:59,280
uh,
you know,

2467
01:53:59,280 --> 01:54:02,390
that that's new story.
That old faithful is not as faithful as

2468
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:03,760
a,
as a pinch.

2469
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:05,063
Yeah.

2470
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:06,011
Yeah.
It's weird.

2471
01:54:06,011 --> 01:54:08,410
The geysers are hot water water's
boiling.

2472
01:54:08,411 --> 01:54:10,330
It shoots up into the sky and we're
like,

2473
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:12,850
ooh,
ah,

2474
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,670
well let's get outta here before giant
furry monster eats us.

2475
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:20,290
Yellowstone's crAzy.
That's a crazy goddamn place.

2476
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:24,610
Those people have grizzly bears,
grizzly bears are there all the time.

2477
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:27,190
There's a police in,
I believe it's Ohio,

2478
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,540
California,
where they have these big mud pits that

2479
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:32,640
people go in that are real hot and,
you know,

2480
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:35,600
but what,
what do you think is heating those on,

2481
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:36,690
under there?
I mean,

2482
01:54:36,700 --> 01:54:39,920
that could also just quickly explode.
I,

2483
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:41,160
I don't know.
I mean,

2484
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:43,050
those,
those hot pits are totally natural and

2485
01:54:43,051 --> 01:54:43,980
Ohio.
Is that what it is?

2486
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:46,190
They,
as far as I know they are.

2487
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,140
I haven't been in my,
I have a healthy fear of them.

2488
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:53,940
I guess for a,
of just,

2489
01:54:54,030 --> 01:54:54,863
just,
you know,

2490
01:54:55,190 --> 01:54:57,080
think things like that.
And um,

2491
01:54:57,200 --> 01:54:58,700
you know,
in nature that could.

2492
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:02,350
Mother nature just wants to kill us

2493
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:05,570
so many ways.
Just sorta right now we're fine.

2494
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:08,060
I mean no,
no need to totally freak out about it,

2495
01:55:08,061 --> 01:55:11,570
but just the awareness that this whole
thing is probably pretty fucking

2496
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:14,780
temporary and we're in the worst state
to live in.

2497
01:55:14,810 --> 01:55:17,180
That's so crazy to say.
I don't know why you say that.

2498
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:21,080
Earthquake volcano were definitely
better off where we were in toronto or

2499
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:22,760
something.
Probably you freeze to death in the

2500
01:55:22,761 --> 01:55:26,750
winter.
Hits black eyes.

2501
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,220
I think this is a really good state,
but a lot of nice people.

2502
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:36,360
More people die in a weather and natural
things in every other state besides

2503
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:37,541
California.
Yeah,

2504
01:55:37,541 --> 01:55:40,150
I mean if there's an earthquake,
there's going to be a few issues for

2505
01:55:40,151 --> 01:55:40,984
sure.
Yeah.

2506
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:42,460
Earthquakes,
fuck a lot of things up.

2507
01:55:42,461 --> 01:55:46,290
But overall man,
like you deal with an earthquake once

2508
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:50,040
every couple of decades.
You deal with winter every fucking year.

2509
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:52,440
If you go back to Ohio,
trying to keep him here

2510
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,330
isn't the biggest fault line like
Missouri or that shit doesn't work

2511
01:56:00,331 --> 01:56:01,350
though.
That's broken.

2512
01:56:01,360 --> 01:56:04,070
So like an old train station that be
broken.

2513
01:56:04,430 --> 01:56:05,730
I don't know man.
I mean,

2514
01:56:05,731 --> 01:56:07,950
look,
we're worried about stuff that we know

2515
01:56:07,951 --> 01:56:11,550
about these,
these spots where the earth could

2516
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:14,580
explode,
but when I fucking rocks in the sky,

2517
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:16,060
that could kill everybody.
They,

2518
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:17,670
they,
they hit all the time.

2519
01:56:17,671 --> 01:56:22,470
They hit every few thousand years.
So these spaces of civilization like

2520
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:24,210
10,000,
12,000 years,

2521
01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:27,240
these where they find these structures
like go beckley,

2522
01:56:27,241 --> 01:56:28,051
tappi,
and they like,

2523
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:29,700
who the fuck?
Where did this,

2524
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:33,720
where's this kind of.
It's so likely that that's just a series

2525
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:35,490
of events.
it's like people build up.

2526
01:56:35,491 --> 01:56:37,530
They figured out society to get things
going really well.

2527
01:56:37,531 --> 01:56:40,450
They stArted improving upon things and
boom,

2528
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,450
everybody's dead rotting bodies in the
street.

2529
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,640
Diseases,
wolves,

2530
01:56:47,880 --> 01:56:52,530
flee to the mountains,
rebuild civilization first.

2531
01:56:52,531 --> 01:56:55,800
Fucking tribes don't make it down to a
few people.

2532
01:56:55,801 --> 01:56:57,750
They slowly bond together.
They rebuild.

2533
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:00,720
I bet that shit happens every 20,000
years or so.

2534
01:57:00,990 --> 01:57:04,800
One of the theories I heard on gold
beckley tapi is that since that's what

2535
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:07,470
happened,
that there was some devastation at that

2536
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:12,471
point that the theory is that they
blamed it on whatever gods and that's

2537
01:57:12,751 --> 01:57:15,540
why I go back to tempe was just covered
at that point.

2538
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,600
We just hired this high debt

2539
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:18,590
right away.
Yeah.

2540
01:57:18,591 --> 01:57:20,630
Well that makes sense.
If you were like a politician you're

2541
01:57:20,631 --> 01:57:24,530
trying to take over after the disaster.
People like these motherfuckers in their

2542
01:57:24,531 --> 01:57:28,220
statues ruined everything and we're
going to fill it in with dirt.

2543
01:57:29,120 --> 01:57:30,970
No,
it'd be like symbolic because you can't

2544
01:57:30,971 --> 01:57:35,030
like run a dope ass city with some
statues that the dude before you made.

2545
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:35,893
Nope.
Nope.

2546
01:57:35,990 --> 01:57:38,900
You got to knock those bitches over.
we still do the same thing today.

2547
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:40,370
Well,
isis is doing it right now.

2548
01:57:40,371 --> 01:57:42,530
All throughout asia.
They keep blowing shit up.

2549
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:46,560
You know we yanked down.
Saddam didn't win.

2550
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:47,361
Yeah.
boy,

2551
01:57:47,361 --> 01:57:48,590
that shit right there.
Head fell off.

2552
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:50,010
Yeah.
Yeah,

2553
01:57:50,630 --> 01:57:52,160
that's right.
That statue.

2554
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:54,230
I forgot about that.
But we all do it.

2555
01:57:54,231 --> 01:57:57,380
We all want to like hide what was before
us because what?

2556
01:57:57,420 --> 01:58:00,000
What we are as good.
What we do is right,

2557
01:58:00,410 --> 01:58:02,970
especially when it comes to someone like
saddam hussein.

2558
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:04,801
Yeah,
like we,

2559
01:58:04,801 --> 01:58:07,610
we like celebrated it.
When that statue went down.

2560
01:58:07,611 --> 01:58:09,770
Yes,
she was dutch folk.

2561
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,650
We dId them all that statues kind of
history,

2562
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:16,040
like we really shouldn't have been
fucking with it because like if you

2563
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:19,700
could see what julius caesar did,
like if you could go back and see what

2564
01:58:19,701 --> 01:58:21,920
nero did,
like all the atrocities that he did,

2565
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:25,070
he wouldn't want to see a statue of him.
But imagine if someone came along and

2566
01:58:25,071 --> 01:58:27,830
smashed a statue of him,
you wouldn't be able to look at it

2567
01:58:27,831 --> 01:58:29,990
today.
Like there's something about when you go

2568
01:58:29,991 --> 01:58:33,770
to a museum and you look at something
from ancient rome and they go,

2569
01:58:33,771 --> 01:58:35,150
wow,
that crazy fucker.

2570
01:58:35,151 --> 01:58:38,630
What was life like?
What was this guy's life like?

2571
01:58:38,920 --> 01:58:40,910
You know,
these people were nuts.

2572
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,040
They were out of their fucking

2573
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:43,780
minds.
They were living at a crazy,

2574
01:58:43,781 --> 01:58:48,400
crazy time of taking over the world with
swords and bows and arrows and shit.

2575
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:53,140
But is saddam hussein worse than them?
No,

2576
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:53,801
no,
no.

2577
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:54,660
Not really.
No.

2578
01:58:54,740 --> 01:58:57,260
They takIng that shit and put it in a
museum somewhere.

2579
01:58:57,330 --> 01:59:00,790
My college had christopher columbus
pointing at the cafeteria.

2580
01:59:01,090 --> 01:59:02,760
Right.
Kids.

2581
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:07,330
He was a cool guy.
He just became something over the last

2582
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:07,601
decade or so.
Right.

2583
01:59:07,601 --> 01:59:10,000
The christopher columbus was a piece of
shit.

2584
01:59:10,040 --> 01:59:10,873
Yeah,
right.

2585
01:59:11,090 --> 01:59:12,320
You know,
another thing,

2586
01:59:13,130 --> 01:59:15,990
I believe it's from graham hancock,
but um,

2587
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:21,670
the iraqi museum had a lot of material
that just got wiped out during these

2588
01:59:22,131 --> 01:59:24,260
wars that will never be able to get
back,

2589
01:59:24,261 --> 01:59:29,261
that had to do with ancient art,
ancient societies and Egypt and things

2590
01:59:29,961 --> 01:59:30,794
like that.
So,

2591
01:59:30,860 --> 01:59:32,750
so during these wars,
you know,

2592
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:34,640
the whole place will just lose it.
You know,

2593
01:59:34,641 --> 01:59:38,180
the museum was alluded so they lost all
of those,

2594
01:59:38,330 --> 01:59:39,163
you know,

2595
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:40,430
that.
And that's a tragedy.

2596
01:59:40,431 --> 01:59:44,270
That's like the birth of modern
civilization is like the tigris and

2597
01:59:44,271 --> 01:59:46,910
euphrates,
that little valley there.

2598
01:59:47,180 --> 01:59:48,440
You got to keep that,
you know,

2599
01:59:48,441 --> 01:59:50,720
I understand the politics,
but you got to keep the history.

2600
01:59:50,721 --> 01:59:53,450
Leave it alone,
that there's rules of war that says you

2601
01:59:53,451 --> 01:59:55,940
can bomb anything you want,
but the colosseum in rome,

2602
01:59:55,941 --> 01:59:57,230
that's not cool.
You do that.

2603
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,760
You will going to talk to you in the hey
glenn,

2604
01:59:58,761 --> 02:00:00,110
a few years,
you know,

2605
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,480
the great wall of China,
you guys leave that alone,

2606
02:00:02,481 --> 02:00:05,540
bomb each other,
but there were protected sites in the

2607
02:00:05,541 --> 02:00:08,420
world that needs to stay protected.
Isn't that weird?

2608
02:00:08,450 --> 02:00:09,920
Like we,
we decide like,

2609
02:00:09,921 --> 02:00:10,610
okay,
look,

2610
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:13,100
we don't like you.
This building's pretty dope.

2611
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:14,510
Yeah.
We're not going to fuck up that

2612
02:00:14,511 --> 02:00:16,460
building.
And then I got you got it.

2613
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,220
Like all right.
No,

2614
02:00:18,221 --> 02:00:19,460
no punching in the face.

2615
02:00:19,670 --> 02:00:20,503
Okay,
cool.

2616
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:25,050
Because I ever bombed paris.
Like the eiffel tower get bombed or

2617
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:26,990
anything.
Anywhere around paris get bombed.

2618
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,870
Yeah.
they just kind of stormed through there

2619
02:00:30,110 --> 02:00:31,670
because they did.
There was like,

2620
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:35,630
there's still like a lot of ammunition.
There's like this area outside of paris

2621
02:00:35,631 --> 02:00:38,030
and France.
It's like the size of paris that you

2622
02:00:38,031 --> 02:00:41,960
can't even go into today because there's
still like ordinances buried under the

2623
02:00:41,961 --> 02:00:43,640
ground.
We keep finding stuff there.

2624
02:00:43,641 --> 02:00:46,010
They stack it up and these warehouses
and shit.

2625
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:50,630
It's just like a depository for bombs
and bomb chemicals.

2626
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:53,450
They all fucking either launched amount
of.

2627
02:00:53,451 --> 02:00:55,820
There are.
They landed there and it didn't go off

2628
02:00:55,821 --> 02:00:59,700
or they left behind mines and bombs was
just huge area that you.

2629
02:00:59,701 --> 02:01:03,440
You can't even go In.
It's all toxic and it's the size of

2630
02:01:03,441 --> 02:01:05,030
parents apparently.
Wow.

2631
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:07,840
Yeah.
So it was wondering like wonder,

2632
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:10,490
was there a conscious decision to not
bomb,

2633
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:12,110
like maybe,
maybe they did and I don't.

2634
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:13,610
I don't know.
I don't think they did.

2635
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:18,611
I think they just kind of rolled through
there because I mean london got the shit

2636
02:01:18,741 --> 02:01:20,870
kicked out of it.
See if you cAn find that picture.

2637
02:01:20,871 --> 02:01:22,850
Ges,
there's photos of the munitions where

2638
02:01:22,851 --> 02:01:24,260
they stack them up.
It's crazy.

2639
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:27,020
Picture of paris getting bombed from the
familiar.

2640
02:01:27,110 --> 02:01:27,943
Oh,
well there you go.

2641
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,920
Did they lead the.
I look at that.

2642
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:34,610
Holy shit.
Wow.

2643
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:37,940
There goes our,
like the library of alexandria got

2644
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:39,950
destroyed.
That was in Egypt though.

2645
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,270
I know,
but I'm just saying that was during the

2646
02:01:41,271 --> 02:01:41,980
muslim.
Yeah.

2647
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:43,190
Yeah.
I know it's a different time period,

2648
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:44,990
but I was just,
I was going to ask like that.

2649
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:49,370
Is there something today that contains a
bunch of history that could be destroyed

2650
02:01:49,371 --> 02:01:50,690
and ruined and setting?
Yeah,

2651
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:51,010
like

2652
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:53,460
computers.
The problem would be if the power went

2653
02:01:53,461 --> 02:01:56,520
out for more than a couple of years,
it's never coming back.

2654
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:58,350
Right.
If the grid got destroyed,

2655
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:01,590
if something happened that was so big
that it destroyed the power grid and we

2656
02:02:01,591 --> 02:02:04,740
needed to reestablish a grid,
good luck,

2657
02:02:05,140 --> 02:02:08,130
and then we lose.
We lose 50 percent of the population in

2658
02:02:08,131 --> 02:02:10,290
the impact.
And then you know what,

2659
02:02:10,291 --> 02:02:14,520
we were left with chaos and lawlessness
and fucking people starving to death and

2660
02:02:14,521 --> 02:02:16,050
no one knows what to do.
Yeah,

2661
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:19,500
good luck in the power back on that.
All would take is one of those things.

2662
02:02:19,501 --> 02:02:21,510
It might take 100 years for the power to
come back on

2663
02:02:21,630 --> 02:02:24,810
and that might not even be negative
intent of humans.

2664
02:02:24,811 --> 02:02:27,330
That can happen just from the sun in
emp.

2665
02:02:27,510 --> 02:02:30,000
We don't know.
We haven't had electric long enough.

2666
02:02:30,001 --> 02:02:32,160
We might have had an emp,
you know,

2667
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:36,990
what's an emp explaining a electrode,
a magnetic pulse,

2668
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:39,050
which would take out all of the
electronic.

2669
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:43,110
You just say emp or emp.
We sit around and talk about this all

2670
02:02:43,111 --> 02:02:44,350
the time was,
was dog.

2671
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,390
But they,
they,

2672
02:02:48,420 --> 02:02:49,850
you know,
there's um,

2673
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:52,750
they've tried to make an amp weapons
that that'll take you,

2674
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,770
take out a full grid.
But if,

2675
02:02:54,890 --> 02:02:58,650
but the son could produce that.
So if the son did that and it could have

2676
02:02:58,651 --> 02:03:01,590
been done in history where we just
didn't have electric,

2677
02:03:01,620 --> 02:03:05,410
there's evidence of an,
of an emp or a solar flare that hit some

2678
02:03:05,411 --> 02:03:07,170
time in the,
in the 19th century,

2679
02:03:07,180 --> 02:03:10,410
we only know about it because a
telegraph like went down all the

2680
02:03:10,411 --> 02:03:13,830
telegraphs in America went down for like
two days and everyone was like,

2681
02:03:13,831 --> 02:03:16,320
what happened?
And then a couple of days later

2682
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:17,970
everything worked again.
And,

2683
02:03:18,090 --> 02:03:21,960
and scientists think that it was a solar
flare or their ejection that caused an

2684
02:03:21,961 --> 02:03:26,340
enp and just shut down all the power for
a few days here it would be a,

2685
02:03:26,490 --> 02:03:30,420
it'd be walking dead if it happened.
Now is so crazy that we rely on that

2686
02:03:30,421 --> 02:03:31,650
thing to stay stable.

2687
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:36,940
This giant ball of nuclear power that's
floating in the sky.

2688
02:03:36,941 --> 02:03:39,010
It's a million times bigger than the
earth.

2689
02:03:39,011 --> 02:03:41,350
And we,
we count on it to stay stable.

2690
02:03:41,770 --> 02:03:45,760
We do what the solar flare is still
happening a lot though.

2691
02:03:46,720 --> 02:03:50,200
Recently there was something that knock
something out from a solar flare,

2692
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:52,840
but the sun has been weird lately.
It's been really,

2693
02:03:52,841 --> 02:03:55,740
really dark and strange.
There's not a lot of activities.

2694
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:59,720
One smokes too much pot.
The sun's been dark and strange.

2695
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:01,660
Not a lot of activity.
Yeah.

2696
02:04:01,661 --> 02:04:02,200
I'm,
I'm,

2697
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:05,320
I'm really talking about being serious.
Oh,

2698
02:04:05,321 --> 02:04:07,870
what's going on with the son?
The son normally has a lot of solar

2699
02:04:07,871 --> 02:04:09,220
activity,
storms,

2700
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:10,900
ejections,
all that kind of stuff.

2701
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:12,400
The last 12,
15 years,

2702
02:04:12,401 --> 02:04:16,990
it's been really qUiet and it's dying.
It's a cycle,

2703
02:04:17,290 --> 02:04:18,640
but you know,
everybody freaks out.

2704
02:04:18,641 --> 02:04:20,910
It's global warming.
It's a little cooling.

2705
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:21,760
It's climate.
This,

2706
02:04:21,761 --> 02:04:23,920
it's,
it's just a solar cycle and it's just.

2707
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:28,180
The sun is just chilled right now,
taking a breather in 10 years and they

2708
02:04:28,181 --> 02:04:28,720
say

2709
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:31,910
our cycle,
they're measuring what they've been

2710
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:36,140
measuring over the period of whatever
amount of decades they've been able to

2711
02:04:36,141 --> 02:04:40,710
measure solar cycles,
but this thing has been around

2712
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:42,301
measurement.
Yeah.

2713
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:43,200
The sun's like,
oh,

2714
02:04:43,201 --> 02:04:46,470
you expect me to behave like I've been
behaving for the last 50 years?

2715
02:04:46,471 --> 02:04:47,820
Yeah,
good luck with that dude,

2716
02:04:48,240 --> 02:04:49,920
because I got a fucking temper
sometimes.

2717
02:04:49,921 --> 02:04:54,840
I like to blow up a whole solar system
turning into a crisp.

2718
02:04:55,080 --> 02:05:00,080
I watched this crazy documentary on
hyper nobles and that they initially

2719
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:03,630
thought that they were.
They were witnessing when they saw these

2720
02:05:03,631 --> 02:05:06,870
gamma burst in the sky,
they thought they were witnessing war

2721
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:10,350
between alien races.
Like that was the initial reaction to

2722
02:05:10,351 --> 02:05:15,150
measuring these gamma burst in the sky
and then they realized somewhere along

2723
02:05:15,151 --> 02:05:18,540
the line that you looking at like a
hyper nova,

2724
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:21,870
like an enormous burst,
an explosion.

2725
02:05:21,871 --> 02:05:26,520
That's so great that if it was in a
nearby cluster it would kIll us.

2726
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:28,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

2727
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:31,380
That gamma radiation.
I think just the whole lowe's that we

2728
02:05:31,381 --> 02:05:33,990
can.
That we can even measure.

2729
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:34,980
Yeah,
and the.

2730
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:37,740
The thing was that it was happening all
day,

2731
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:41,190
all throughout the sky.
Like they would be like measuring this

2732
02:05:41,220 --> 02:05:42,450
for the first time and they've seen

2733
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:45,023
cool,

2734
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:49,660
like all these different spots in the
universe.

2735
02:05:49,661 --> 02:05:53,050
we're experiencing these gamma burst.
How would you not think it's star wars?

2736
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:54,910
Yeah,
I totally think that's exactly what they

2737
02:05:54,911 --> 02:05:55,361
thought.
Like,

2738
02:05:55,361 --> 02:05:57,520
oh my god,
what If they come?

2739
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,710
What if they come and they have this
kind of power?

2740
02:05:59,711 --> 02:06:00,870
They have gamma power,
right?

2741
02:06:00,910 --> 02:06:02,410
So we have to band,
we'd,

2742
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:03,520
we have to,
you know,

2743
02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:06,720
get society on the right track.
It seems like at least we could like

2744
02:06:06,730 --> 02:06:10,510
give them are gold are women and they
might leave us be,

2745
02:06:10,690 --> 02:06:13,630
it might be possible to negotiate,
but you can't go.

2746
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:16,330
I'm just kidding about that obviously,
but you can't negotiate with a

2747
02:06:16,331 --> 02:06:17,800
supernova.
You know,

2748
02:06:17,801 --> 02:06:22,801
when a sun explodes and takes out the
entire surrounding area for billions and

2749
02:06:24,550 --> 02:06:25,510
billions of miles,
that's it.

2750
02:06:25,570 --> 02:06:27,130
It's like,
it's less,

2751
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:31,390
it's less feared,
but way scarier.

2752
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:33,970
Right?
You can't build an ark to escape a nova,

2753
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,980
you know,
like it's just not.

2754
02:06:36,010 --> 02:06:40,060
That's just a little water.
It apparently it happens all the time.

2755
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,440
you know,
and you probably won't happening right

2756
02:06:41,441 --> 02:06:44,530
now somewhere and you can never convince
society of it that,

2757
02:06:44,531 --> 02:06:45,970
hey,
we've got bigger problems to worry

2758
02:06:45,971 --> 02:06:48,610
about.
Then between me and you hear the pot

2759
02:06:48,611 --> 02:06:51,450
delivery services you fuck at
[inaudible] dot com.

2760
02:06:51,610 --> 02:06:56,610
[inaudible] dot com delivers
a,

2761
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,480
you'll get a little package like this,
just like amazon prime,

2762
02:07:01,481 --> 02:07:06,280
although it'll be in a box that you
don't look lIke just a regular delivery.

2763
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:08,010
This is your cue,
etc. You're getting them,

2764
02:07:08,380 --> 02:07:11,050
you're sending them through the mail.
It's not through the mail.

2765
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:14,030
A of people during the medical courier?
Yeah.

2766
02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:15,700
Oh,
career medical courier.

2767
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:18,210
How high is your medical courier?
Well,

2768
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:19,540
the middle of driving,
going,

2769
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:24,541
what am I doing with my feet?
They actually don't know what medicine

2770
02:07:26,381 --> 02:07:28,240
they have because they do all sorts of
medication.

2771
02:07:28,241 --> 02:07:30,520
They don't just,
they don't just do pot,

2772
02:07:30,670 --> 02:07:33,490
don't meanwhile,
but they're still high as fuck.

2773
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,940
So I'm uh,

2774
02:07:36,730 --> 02:07:37,690
you know,
uh,

2775
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:40,550
there are regulations that are coming
down for,

2776
02:07:40,580 --> 02:07:42,680
for transported as well.
Uh,

2777
02:07:42,681 --> 02:07:45,520
the teamsters want to get their,
their hands and transport,

2778
02:07:45,521 --> 02:07:50,521
which they are one of the people who are
rallying against legalization of

2779
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:54,390
marijuana.
I'm there with the,

2780
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,473
the,
um,

2781
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:59,740
the unions for prisons.
So they're kind of fighting on both

2782
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:01,600
sides.
They want to be involved in

2783
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:06,310
transportation of marijuana,
however they're lobbying for to keep it

2784
02:08:06,311 --> 02:08:06,980
illegal.

2785
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,200
Did the teamsters,
they're going to be on whatever side

2786
02:08:09,201 --> 02:08:11,710
winds are over here now.
Okay.

2787
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:12,580
You're over here now.

2788
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:13,413
Yeah.
Yeah.

2789
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:14,733
Um,
so,

2790
02:08:14,930 --> 02:08:15,830
so again,
uh,

2791
02:08:15,831 --> 02:08:17,000
you know,
uh,

2792
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:22,960
what we were considered was similar to
the dominoes of marijuana here in la.

2793
02:08:24,260 --> 02:08:25,041
We,
we,

2794
02:08:25,041 --> 02:08:26,060
uh,
are evolving.

2795
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:28,940
That's what we were doing before this
lawsuit happened.

2796
02:08:29,150 --> 02:08:32,540
We really want to be considered more
like amazon prime.

2797
02:08:32,780 --> 02:08:33,710
So,
uh,

2798
02:08:33,711 --> 02:08:38,711
where you're making a lot of money.
And we were dumb now that I be like

2799
02:08:41,541 --> 02:08:43,230
circuit city,
well,

2800
02:08:43,340 --> 02:08:48,340
governor brown's new laws have changed
so that marijuana companies can be for

2801
02:08:48,951 --> 02:08:51,530
profit now.
They don't have to be not for profit,

2802
02:08:52,140 --> 02:08:54,530
which is how it's been for the last 20
years here.

2803
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:55,880
So,
um,

2804
02:08:56,570 --> 02:09:00,560
and so that has to go into effect by
2018.

2805
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:04,610
So that's something to consider also,
once that happens,

2806
02:09:04,611 --> 02:09:07,070
that changes things for a lot of
cannabis businesses,

2807
02:09:07,310 --> 02:09:09,900
but that all said,
every cannabis business that's in,

2808
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:12,390
in la,
that's not a dispensary in,

2809
02:09:12,391 --> 02:09:16,060
in that whether they're making edibles
or they making vaporizers or,

2810
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:16,610
or anything.

2811
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:19,310
And it's a thriving industry.
They're all illegal.

2812
02:09:19,670 --> 02:09:22,520
Every bit of it.
So regulation does need that,

2813
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:23,620
that,
that happened,

2814
02:09:23,670 --> 02:09:24,503
uh,
you know,

2815
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:26,660
uh,
here in la and what we're asking for

2816
02:09:26,661 --> 02:09:30,350
isn't he just overturned this.
We're not saying that we're saying we

2817
02:09:30,351 --> 02:09:35,351
know the city attorney does believe that
safe access is important,

2818
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:39,530
but he feels he has to uphold this law
that was put into effect before he was

2819
02:09:39,531 --> 02:09:43,250
the city attorney.
So since he knows this is a bad law that

2820
02:09:43,251 --> 02:09:48,170
he has to enforce,
he could also affect change by helping

2821
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:51,710
go down the path of legalization for
good businesses.

2822
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:53,270
He'S,
he's not an idiot.

2823
02:09:53,271 --> 02:09:57,730
he realizes what a bad law is.
He just knows his job is to enforce it.

2824
02:09:57,860 --> 02:09:59,390
Got it.
So hopefully,

2825
02:09:59,540 --> 02:10:03,560
hopefully he'll join the fight to find a
path towards legal.

2826
02:10:03,561 --> 02:10:03,890
Yeah.

2827
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:05,360
Okay.
What can people do with the people that

2828
02:10:05,361 --> 02:10:08,090
are listening the to wrap this all up?
What,

2829
02:10:08,091 --> 02:10:09,320
uh,
the people that are listening,

2830
02:10:09,321 --> 02:10:11,780
what's a good way to follow this or a
good way to help?

2831
02:10:12,170 --> 02:10:13,990
Good way to help.
If you're in California,

2832
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,830
good way to help us to join our
collective energy.

2833
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:19,070
You buy anything and we'll keep you in
touch with the politicians and will put

2834
02:10:19,071 --> 02:10:21,620
pressure on them.
If you're outside of California,

2835
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:23,300
what dOes that mean?
You politicians,

2836
02:10:23,301 --> 02:10:25,670
you put pressure on them joining.
What would that entail?

2837
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:28,520
A joining our collective like if you're
a medical marijuana patient,

2838
02:10:28,580 --> 02:10:33,020
join [inaudible] dot com and we are
working actively with the city.

2839
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,360
Try to solve this.
It's not.

2840
02:10:34,610 --> 02:10:35,990
So we're fighting in court?
Yes,

2841
02:10:35,991 --> 02:10:38,780
on one hand,
but on the other hand we are conversing

2842
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:40,820
with the city,
like the city knows this is broken.

2843
02:10:40,880 --> 02:10:42,650
Okay,
well what do you mean by joining your

2844
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:43,100
collective?

2845
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,300
LIke what?
What does that entail?

2846
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:49,330
Go to go to [inaudible] dot com.
Click join and you put your name,

2847
02:10:50,270 --> 02:10:52,100
email address.
That's all they have to do.

2848
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:54,710
That's pretty much it.
Do they have to show you proof of

2849
02:10:54,711 --> 02:10:57,650
medical marijuana license?
They do if they want to order

2850
02:10:57,680 --> 02:10:59,570
prescription,
but if they could join your collective

2851
02:10:59,571 --> 02:11:01,850
without doing that,
they need to show proof that there are

2852
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,320
patient to join a collective.
Oh,

2853
02:11:03,321 --> 02:11:04,041
okay.
All right.

2854
02:11:04,041 --> 02:11:04,980
That's what I was asking.
Yeah,

2855
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:08,360
but we also have are so lackadaisical
with us.

2856
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:10,010
So normal.
it's like,

2857
02:11:10,011 --> 02:11:11,210
yeah,
just join a collective.

2858
02:11:11,260 --> 02:11:13,070
Like it's,
it's hard to,

2859
02:11:13,090 --> 02:11:16,190
you know,
it's hard to be wedding people don't

2860
02:11:16,191 --> 02:11:20,760
know what we're even talking about.
What it is trouble you can,

2861
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:22,430
if you don't have your card,
your,

2862
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:25,730
your doctor recommendation,
you could get it right on our website by

2863
02:11:25,731 --> 02:11:28,700
doing a skype session with your doctor
and you know,

2864
02:11:28,701 --> 02:11:31,870
we told the story about about how,
how we got our cards in.

2865
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,370
It's changed so much.
Wait a minute,

2866
02:11:34,460 --> 02:11:38,230
a doctor or I have to get my doctor to
do a skype session.

2867
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:39,650
Your own doctor,
right?

2868
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:41,150
yeah.
so now you're a doctor,

2869
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:43,400
you're saying not your doctor,
your doctor.

2870
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:45,260
We have a group of doctors.
RIght.

2871
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:48,850
That's what I'm saying,
that our professional doctors that you

2872
02:11:48,851 --> 02:11:50,840
will do a real skype session and
they'll.

2873
02:11:50,841 --> 02:11:53,840
And they'll talk to you about what your
ailment is and,

2874
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:56,270
and you could get your card instead of
going somewhere.

2875
02:11:56,390 --> 02:11:58,440
You could just do it right in your
living room.

2876
02:11:58,441 --> 02:11:59,620
That's an important point.
See,

2877
02:11:59,730 --> 02:12:01,940
when you were making it seem like the
guy had to get like,

2878
02:12:01,970 --> 02:12:03,110
oh man,
I've got to get my doctorate.

2879
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:03,640
No,
no,

2880
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:04,473
no,
no.

2881
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:06,740
Ten minutes.
I've been at 1:00,

2882
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:10,160
jesus christ.
How many tokens a it takes 10 minutes to

2883
02:12:10,161 --> 02:12:10,491
do.
Right?

2884
02:12:10,491 --> 02:12:14,190
On our website we hAve this amazing
interactive people waiting that will be

2885
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:17,730
selling point will take you right
through the whole process where we need

2886
02:12:17,731 --> 02:12:20,870
to do we need to buy a warehouse in
California and a bunch of people use it

2887
02:12:20,871 --> 02:12:24,710
as their mailing address and get people
from other states to become a part of

2888
02:12:24,711 --> 02:12:26,930
your collective and they have like a
fake mailing address.

2889
02:12:26,970 --> 02:12:29,570
Then we hook them up,
but we are we going to talk more about

2890
02:12:29,571 --> 02:12:32,030
that idea?
He goes,

2891
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:35,120
dark city attorneys watching.
I didn't know.

2892
02:12:35,121 --> 02:12:37,310
Yes,
it's going to do it that way,

2893
02:12:37,311 --> 02:12:38,700
but I think it's just funny that you
know,

2894
02:12:38,750 --> 02:12:41,870
you have to be in this patch of dirt in
order to follow those rules.

2895
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:43,940
Like you can't.
You couldn't join the collective.

2896
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:45,770
You couldn't be like from most constant
and decided,

2897
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:47,840
oh,
I want to join one of those California

2898
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:50,850
poc collectives.
I'll skype in with the doctor and no,

2899
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:53,630
you have to actually like have like your
mail delivered here.

2900
02:12:53,631 --> 02:12:54,590
It's so stupid.
It's weird.

2901
02:12:54,591 --> 02:12:58,220
Like an arbitrary line in the sand
politically across this line.

2902
02:12:58,221 --> 02:13:00,710
go to jail,
come back here and get baked and have a

2903
02:13:00,711 --> 02:13:02,030
good time.
Well that's what happens with people

2904
02:13:02,031 --> 02:13:05,140
that go into Texas.
You fuck up and you're in a tour bus.

2905
02:13:05,160 --> 02:13:08,030
You know,
we're this way is the bass and here.

2906
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:10,710
Oh no,
that's a song.

2907
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:13,070
You get pulled over and you're like,
oh no.

2908
02:13:13,071 --> 02:13:16,280
We got pulled over for weed in Texas.
This is not like getting pulled over for

2909
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:19,340
weeding California and next thing you
know willie nelson's in jail.

2910
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:21,080
Yeah,
that's a Willie Nelson got arrested,

2911
02:13:21,081 --> 02:13:22,460
right?
It's hilarious.

2912
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:25,280
Someone such a piece of shit.
They arrested Willie Nelson.

2913
02:13:25,281 --> 02:13:27,440
I'd quit my job so my kids are going
hungry.

2914
02:13:27,470 --> 02:13:28,970
Fucked us.
It's actually great.

2915
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:32,400
It's actually pretty scary getting
pulled over with weed in California

2916
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:35,820
nowadays because of dui rate has gone
crazy.

2917
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:38,880
My friend's a lawyer,
dui lawyer and half of his cases now are

2918
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:42,630
just from marijuana and they have a new
test where they do the same kind of

2919
02:13:42,631 --> 02:13:44,140
thing with your eye,
but it,

2920
02:13:44,141 --> 02:13:47,940
it like goes left and right real fast if
you're high or something like that.

2921
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:50,870
And if they feel like they,
they can smell weed and if,

2922
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:53,520
if you fail this test,
you're getting a dui just like an

2923
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:55,460
alcoholic left to right.
We'll quit.

2924
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:56,830
So you know when,
when,

2925
02:13:56,850 --> 02:13:58,770
when you get pulled over,
they do the test with your.

2926
02:13:58,771 --> 02:14:00,330
I like fall,
my aunt.

2927
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:04,470
I think with alcohol,
I think it shoots over like your eyes

2928
02:14:04,471 --> 02:14:07,680
shoots over to the left or the right
really fast or it's jerky,

2929
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:08,790
uh,
when you're,

2930
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:11,400
when you're high,
your eye reacts different every day.

2931
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:14,270
It's kind of like a jiggly left and
right effect when it,

2932
02:14:14,330 --> 02:14:16,480
there can't be any science.
So that's,

2933
02:14:16,700 --> 02:14:21,120
that's it right now.
And right now in court they are fighting

2934
02:14:21,121 --> 02:14:22,920
just that.
If it's,

2935
02:14:22,950 --> 02:14:27,390
if it's a legit test and they don't have
a like a point,

2936
02:14:27,391 --> 02:14:28,500
oh,
eight for weed yet.

2937
02:14:28,501 --> 02:14:30,230
So they didn't really have any laws.

2938
02:14:30,230 --> 02:14:32,210
There's the main problem,
and I think you'll agree with me,

2939
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:35,330
there's never been a study that shows
that any loss of motor skills.

2940
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:36,081
No,
none.

2941
02:14:36,081 --> 02:14:38,690
Right?
There wAs one study about driving a

2942
02:14:38,750 --> 02:14:42,150
while smoking weed and that they found
that people actually performed better

2943
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:43,311
route.
Well,

2944
02:14:43,311 --> 02:14:45,440
that's the problem.
It's not a motor skill thing.

2945
02:14:45,441 --> 02:14:48,500
It's not like alcohol.
Everybody knows that if you drink too

2946
02:14:48,501 --> 02:14:49,820
much,
you don't drIve good.

2947
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:52,130
Everybody knows that it's bad for your
motor skills.

2948
02:14:52,700 --> 02:14:54,050
Pot's not.
It's simple.

2949
02:14:54,051 --> 02:14:56,470
So what are they pulling you over for
exactly?

2950
02:14:56,490 --> 02:14:59,300
state of mind.
So because if it doesn't affect your

2951
02:14:59,301 --> 02:15:01,850
motor skills,
like is it affecting your judgment?

2952
02:15:01,851 --> 02:15:06,320
Can you prove that people were
intoxicated on marijuana perform less

2953
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:10,010
intelligently than people that are
intoxicated on caffeine or cigarettes

2954
02:15:10,280 --> 02:15:12,740
because you know they're doing that.
A cop could pull a guy over,

2955
02:15:12,741 --> 02:15:15,590
he could have a cigarette in the corner
of his mouth drinking a cup of coffee

2956
02:15:15,770 --> 02:15:16,760
and no one says a word.

2957
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,620
Those are two drugs interact with each
other.

2958
02:15:18,621 --> 02:15:20,780
No one has a pro.
So it's a state of mind issue.

2959
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,420
So.
And he could have those drugs and still

2960
02:15:23,421 --> 02:15:27,080
have a couple of pops at the bar to
really amp up all that aggression and

2961
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:29,600
still legally drive behind what is,
um,

2962
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:31,190
what his intoxication.
I mean,

2963
02:15:31,191 --> 02:15:33,500
isn't intoxication is supposed to be a
loss of motor skills?

2964
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:34,730
Well,
right.

2965
02:15:34,731 --> 02:15:38,340
But it's sort of arbitrary because wHat,
what is intoxicated?

2966
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:42,170
the swab test just did not pass in
California where they were trying to,

2967
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:45,050
to swab for thc molecules and it's like,
no,

2968
02:15:45,051 --> 02:15:47,130
that's totally,
you can't do that because.

2969
02:15:47,140 --> 02:15:50,660
Because I'm going to just walk through a
party and then they get swapped and

2970
02:15:50,661 --> 02:15:53,270
they're in trouble.
They don't have any of it in their

2971
02:15:53,271 --> 02:15:54,100
system.
You can't,

2972
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:56,950
you can't.
Like gino would,

2973
02:15:56,970 --> 02:15:57,803
what?
He smokes.

2974
02:15:57,860 --> 02:15:58,340
I don't know.

2975
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:00,300
I don't even know when he's high.
I don't know when he's done.

2976
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:02,710
Trust me is high right now.
Trust me.

2977
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,380
You wouldn't know.
So mAny people are high right now and

2978
02:16:06,381 --> 02:16:07,340
you wouldn't know.
Right?

2979
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:09,920
Of course.
So how can you test for it?

2980
02:16:09,950 --> 02:16:10,201
Well,
they're.

2981
02:16:10,201 --> 02:16:14,930
The real problem is what can you show is
bad about being high?

2982
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:20,120
I need to see something on your tests
where you show me why you should be able

2983
02:16:20,121 --> 02:16:24,440
to pull people over with why you're
wearing a gun and shine a light in their

2984
02:16:24,441 --> 02:16:27,710
face and get them out of their vehicle
and make them do things like what is the

2985
02:16:27,711 --> 02:16:29,530
worst case you're looking for?
Okay.

2986
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:30,310
What's

2987
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:33,820
the worst case scenario that's going on
with this person that's on the

2988
02:16:33,821 --> 02:16:37,030
marijuana?
Are they performing in any way,

2989
02:16:37,031 --> 02:16:39,490
shape or form?
Whether they're a danger the people

2990
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:40,960
around them.
So if that's.

2991
02:16:40,961 --> 02:16:43,480
If that is true,
I think you have to prove that before

2992
02:16:43,481 --> 02:16:45,010
you put people in a fucking cage.

2993
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:47,550
It also varies from person to person.
I believe.

2994
02:16:47,551 --> 02:16:49,770
I know a girl that smokes a joint,
she can't drive.

2995
02:16:49,771 --> 02:16:52,360
She can barely function as a human,
but jay,

2996
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:54,570
you know,
could do a whole ounce and you'll be

2997
02:16:54,571 --> 02:16:57,180
fine to drive as exact same driver as
before,

2998
02:16:57,181 --> 02:16:58,680
if not better.
But this girl,

2999
02:16:58,740 --> 02:17:00,390
no way.
I wouldn't even let her in the car.

3000
02:17:00,391 --> 02:17:02,640
She smoked her that she probably
shouldn't be able to drive anyway.

3001
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:06,650
How about that shit?
Right?

3002
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:09,150
There should be like a test,
we've talked about this before,

3003
02:17:09,151 --> 02:17:11,250
like a marijuana test,
like you are a 10,

3004
02:17:11,251 --> 02:17:13,920
meaning you could do with marijuana and
anything and you're fine,

3005
02:17:13,921 --> 02:17:15,720
but this person's like rated a six.

3006
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:17,460
It's just.
But it's a mind issue.

3007
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:19,770
It's not.
It's not a motor skill issue.

3008
02:17:19,800 --> 02:17:21,780
This is where the problem lies.
It's like,

3009
02:17:21,781 --> 02:17:23,280
yeah,
I guess some people would freak out when

3010
02:17:23,281 --> 02:17:25,620
they're on pot and they will do lose
their mind and maybe they shouldn't be

3011
02:17:25,621 --> 02:17:27,660
intoxicated,
but those people probably lose their

3012
02:17:27,661 --> 02:17:29,670
mind if someone yelled at them right
now.

3013
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:31,620
Some people would just weak.
They just,

3014
02:17:31,650 --> 02:17:34,590
whatever the,
the glue that keeps their reality

3015
02:17:34,591 --> 02:17:38,040
together.
It's just really fragile and then throw

3016
02:17:38,041 --> 02:17:39,960
some pot in there or a drink.
I mean,

3017
02:17:39,961 --> 02:17:44,550
how many people do we know that have one
drink and they get fucking crazy.

3018
02:17:44,551 --> 02:17:46,980
That's a person who's reality's really
shaky.

3019
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,540
Right?
But that doesn't have anything to do

3020
02:17:48,541 --> 02:17:49,860
with me.
You know,

3021
02:17:49,870 --> 02:17:54,870
and the idea that cops look towards that
as being the standard is ridiculous.

3022
02:17:56,390 --> 02:17:57,320
Right?
So if you like,

3023
02:17:57,330 --> 02:17:59,520
if it wasn't going to say,
if you have like a festival,

3024
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:02,070
like a,
a cop's test,

3025
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:05,070
potheads festival,
we would do it.

3026
02:18:05,290 --> 02:18:09,070
We would fucking do it.
Look for sure you have go-karts.

3027
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:10,320
Set it up.
What do you want to do?

3028
02:18:10,321 --> 02:18:13,530
You want to have a fucking one of those
mud bogger races.

3029
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:15,090
We'll do this.
Let us smoke pot.

3030
02:18:15,091 --> 02:18:16,740
We'll do all that.
We'll have jujitsu tournaments where

3031
02:18:16,741 --> 02:18:20,760
people smoke pot before they do jujitsu.
It orange cones and clipboards and some

3032
02:18:20,761 --> 02:18:23,460
wheat and people will join.
Fuck you.

3033
02:18:23,461 --> 02:18:24,690
And we'll learn.
We'll know.

3034
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:27,420
Yeah.
What you need to show some sort of

3035
02:18:27,421 --> 02:18:31,260
significant issue because there's a
significant issue with some people,

3036
02:18:31,261 --> 02:18:33,990
but you're not even stopping those
people from taking.

3037
02:18:33,991 --> 02:18:38,070
Who knows what the fuck they're taking
as far as antidepressants are

3038
02:18:38,071 --> 02:18:40,980
psychoactive substances prescribed by
their doctors.

3039
02:18:40,981 --> 02:18:43,560
And how many people are on fucking
adderall?

3040
02:18:43,561 --> 02:18:44,560
Man,
that's meth.

3041
02:18:44,580 --> 02:18:46,560
They're taking meth.
They're driving around.

3042
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:49,920
You know,
I know a bunch of adults that take that

3043
02:18:49,921 --> 02:18:53,080
shit on a daily basis yet.
So w,

3044
02:18:53,130 --> 02:18:56,550
what you're dealing with is a lot of
different chemicals that could

3045
02:18:56,551 --> 02:18:59,010
potentially fuck with a mind.
Like why are you concentrated on pot

3046
02:18:59,910 --> 02:19:02,100
given shown any reason to concentrate on
pot.

3047
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:04,940
You know,
the chIef of police in New York city

3048
02:19:04,941 --> 02:19:09,941
recently said that every crime could be
tied back to marijuana that's holding

3049
02:19:11,571 --> 02:19:12,404
him,
uh,

3050
02:19:12,460 --> 02:19:15,020
you know,
which is a criminal outrageous because

3051
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:19,760
it's just trying to give more reach for
police officers to pull you over.

3052
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:23,900
Irresponsible thing to say.
That's like saying every crime can be

3053
02:19:23,901 --> 02:19:25,700
tied back to water.
Parents,

3054
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:27,900
we all have 96 of water.
All.

3055
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:31,010
Yeah.
It's all stupid man.

3056
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:35,090
It really is.
It's just something that should be a

3057
02:19:35,091 --> 02:19:37,940
joke that We look back on from the 19
thirties.

3058
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:39,140
We look back and like,
oh wow,

3059
02:19:39,141 --> 02:19:41,750
look at the craziness that these people
that are dealing with baCk then.

3060
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:45,350
But instead we have to deal with it
today and the age of google and

3061
02:19:45,351 --> 02:19:49,160
information,
scientific studies ad nauseum that all

3062
02:19:49,161 --> 02:19:51,800
show the same thing.
And none of Them show any negative

3063
02:19:51,801 --> 02:19:52,850
effects.
None of them.

3064
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:54,830
There's like some questions about
memory.

3065
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:56,780
That's it.
But it seems to only affect you while

3066
02:19:56,781 --> 02:19:58,010
you're on it.
When you get off of it.

3067
02:19:58,011 --> 02:19:59,900
It doesn't seem to have any effect on
your memory at all.

3068
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:03,630
I mean,
the head of the dea currently said

3069
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:05,430
medical marijuana.
That's just a joke.

3070
02:20:05,431 --> 02:20:06,900
Let let's,
let's get past that.

3071
02:20:07,260 --> 02:20:12,260
And I'm the head of the dea before that,
when asked by congress it,

3072
02:20:14,130 --> 02:20:17,880
is marijuana a more detrimental than
meth?

3073
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:20,550
She said she can't.
And we played that many times

3074
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:21,950
was on the show because it's so
ridiculous.

3075
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:23,170
That was laying heart,
right?

3076
02:20:23,171 --> 02:20:24,030
Yeah.
She was in.

3077
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:26,850
This was a senator or something.
kept grilling her.

3078
02:20:27,720 --> 02:20:30,120
If you haven't seen it,
it's fucking infuriating.

3079
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:33,350
It is.
So what's so infuriating also is that we

3080
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:37,040
all know so well.
How come these people who are in power

3081
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:39,500
aren't,
aren't in the know why

3082
02:20:41,230 --> 02:20:43,890
not a no,
it's that they are the official

3083
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:45,090
response.
Right?

3084
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:47,490
So they looked at ladies just doing her
job.

3085
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,040
She couldn't just speak out of turn.
She couldn't.

3086
02:20:50,041 --> 02:20:52,200
She would get fired.
She couldn't just say whatever she

3087
02:20:52,201 --> 02:20:53,130
wants.
Even if she doesn't.

3088
02:20:53,310 --> 02:20:55,470
Even if she doesn't believe that it
should be illegal,

3089
02:20:55,860 --> 02:20:57,900
she's not going to say that because
that's not her job.

3090
02:20:57,901 --> 02:21:01,950
Her job is to do whatever the fuck her
superiors tell her to do and to stay

3091
02:21:01,951 --> 02:21:05,220
employed and make sure her budget
doesn't get exactly.

3092
02:21:05,221 --> 02:21:06,960
That's her job.
So it's not even her fault.

3093
02:21:06,980 --> 02:21:10,260
It's the fault of the system that they
accept that the whole thing is

3094
02:21:10,261 --> 02:21:11,370
preposterous.
IT doesn't,

3095
02:21:11,940 --> 02:21:13,110
doesn't hold up anymore.

3096
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:14,930
Well,
this is why we have to play this game of

3097
02:21:14,931 --> 02:21:16,340
politics.
You know,

3098
02:21:16,430 --> 02:21:18,380
we,
we just want to want to run a business

3099
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:20,730
and a good business,
but we have to play this game of

3100
02:21:20,731 --> 02:21:24,680
politics because if we don't,
from the bottom effect change through

3101
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:29,060
those people who are at the top,
then we didn't and let them continue to

3102
02:21:29,061 --> 02:21:32,330
create these laws.
We could just go another 20 years with

3103
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:35,870
these bad laws when there's no reason
for it,

3104
02:21:36,070 --> 02:21:36,903
you know?
Yeah.

3105
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:40,840
I think you're right.
I'm just hoping that what's gonna go on

3106
02:21:40,841 --> 02:21:43,750
is that,
as you know from the time that I first

3107
02:21:43,751 --> 02:21:47,020
got my license up today,
how much more open?

3108
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:49,600
It's been much more relaxed,
people are much more accepting,

3109
02:21:49,601 --> 02:21:52,390
people are of it and much more accepting
amongst grown adults.

3110
02:21:52,391 --> 02:21:55,290
You just see the attitudes of people.
They're changing and people

3111
02:21:55,310 --> 02:21:58,360
understanding how beneficial or how
beneficial it is,

3112
02:21:58,361 --> 02:22:00,190
especially for people who need it.
Medically.

3113
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:02,200
Cancer patients,
things,

3114
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:05,710
things along those lines.
Kids with epilepsy add things along

3115
02:22:05,711 --> 02:22:07,690
those lines.
There's just so many people that benefit

3116
02:22:07,691 --> 02:22:08,160
from it.
It's,

3117
02:22:08,160 --> 02:22:12,790
it's hopefully it's on its way out.
All the laws are on their way out.

3118
02:22:12,820 --> 02:22:13,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

3119
02:22:13,230 --> 02:22:15,840
And,
and you can't just disregard the

3120
02:22:15,841 --> 02:22:18,630
experience of,
of the masses.

3121
02:22:18,750 --> 02:22:19,920
Yeah,
exactly.

3122
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:25,590
It's not fair and it's because we're,
we're lucky to be in sort of the media

3123
02:22:25,591 --> 02:22:25,980
age,

3124
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:29,650
which can be annoying at times,
but it also allows information at move

3125
02:22:29,651 --> 02:22:30,560
very quickly.
Yeah.

3126
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:33,780
So it's.
So if your kid is helped by having fewer

3127
02:22:33,781 --> 02:22:36,000
seizures,
everybody's gonna know about that in 24

3128
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:36,830
hours,
so.

3129
02:22:36,830 --> 02:22:40,140
So you can't really suppress the truth
any longer.

3130
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:43,550
And even Texas is polling positively.
Yeah.

3131
02:22:43,780 --> 02:22:45,710
Florida is going to pass it,
you knoW,

3132
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:49,380
Pennsylvania just passed it.
It's the dominoes are falling,

3133
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:52,320
the dominoes are falling.
And people at chris christie or going to

3134
02:22:52,321 --> 02:22:56,250
be as amber lyon likes to say on the
wrong side of history and that's just,

3135
02:22:56,251 --> 02:22:59,340
there's no other way around it.
It's just this guy's a fool.

3136
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:03,690
He's a fool and he needs to get off the
sugar contact mark sisson bitch.

3137
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:06,300
He'll straighten you out.
Primal blueprint.com.

3138
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:08,310
All right.
That's it.

3139
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:09,840
Goodnight everybody.
Thank you,

3140
02:23:09,841 --> 02:23:10,531
gino.
Thank you.

3141
02:23:10,531 --> 02:23:11,700
Ha.
Thanks to red band.

3142
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:12,391
Oh,

3143
02:23:12,391 --> 02:23:17,180
You got to show this thursday,
denver comedy works and then regard

3144
02:23:17,190 --> 02:23:19,410
there with George Perez and ryan doing
the following week.

3145
02:23:19,411 --> 02:23:21,930
We're in New York with the legion of
skanks people.

3146
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:23,550
The skank fest.
Powerful

3147
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:26,580
fast.
So a denver comedy works thursday.

3148
02:23:26,581 --> 02:23:31,380
Awesome spot tomorrow night.
I'm at the ice house with ian edwards.

3149
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:34,470
Ian's doing both shows and I think joe
is doing the second show too.

3150
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:35,260
So,
um,

3151
02:23:35,260 --> 02:23:38,740
this will be the last show that I do
before I do my comedy specials.

3152
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:41,230
So a fox.
