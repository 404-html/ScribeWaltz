1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,140
The joe rogan experience.
So I'm a woman who is into nice clothes

2
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,070
and nice nails.
No,

3
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:08,960
I didn't say he's into.
And you can tell by the type,

4
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,300
the type,
but what is the type the guy should look

5
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:13,640
out for?
If you're a like you are going to give a

6
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,300
seminar how?
Gosh should avoid nightmare horrible

7
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,100
women in their life,
which should they avoid.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,870
Okay.
You okay?

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,040
Okay.
First of all,

10
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,840
it's a case by case basis.
There's plenty different horrible

11
00:00:23,841 --> 00:00:24,674
things.
Of course,

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:29,390
if she's got big old French tip nails,
she's a little bit of white trash.

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,580
Okay.
Friendship nails are bad.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,670
Like long press on French tip nails.
What if they're real nails?

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,190
They're French.
Touch tip is,

16
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,960
to me it's just such a trashy book,
but that's fine.

17
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay.
I don't know.

18
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,800
Um,
what about like dark red,

19
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:46,010
like Spanish girl with red lipstick and
dark red nails?

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,230
It depends on the girl.
It's a whole package because you can

21
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:51,530
have trashy elements like I'm wearing
cut off jeans right now in a see through

22
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:52,980
tank top.
That's what I'm talking about.

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,980
But it's ready to judge you.
But the rest of me is not polished.

24
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:00,800
It's not like the rest I've got like
messy hair and one foot painted.

25
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,500
Is that okay?
It's okay because I'm like not trying.

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,390
Okay.
I think it's just,

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:08,900
there's just certain looks that women
have and I don't want to say,

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,100
oh,
it's this hairdo.

29
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,480
It's that.
It's a whole,

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,150
and you know what I'm talking about.
It's a whole myriad of elements that

31
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:16,370
come together.
Does she have,

32
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,440
and there's nothing wrong with having
like enhancements.

33
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:22,580
Does she have fake lips and fake tits
and hair extensions and claws?

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,930
Andy,
she weren't stripper heels.

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,610
Well then she's probably fucking
horrible.

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,810
Like let's get serious lucite heels like
indoors.

37
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,510
That's pretty rare though,
isn't it?

38
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:33,880
I mean we're with some pretty extreme
examples.

39
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,070
I don't even know what realm we're
dealing with.

40
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,700
The fake lip thing is a,
that's a crazy one too.

41
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,520
Like they never really worked that out
in so many girls jumped on that

42
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,020
bandwagon.
Excuse me,

43
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,140
jumped on that bandwagon.
They fucked up their face forever.

44
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,120
I think women in Hollywood make a
decision.

45
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:51,340
They were like,
I would rather look super weird that

46
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:54,760
look super old because when you like a
lot of them you can't tell what they

47
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:55,810
are,
how old they are.

48
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,980
This is so weird.
There's this woman that I see at my

49
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,280
daughter's school when I drop my kid off
in the morning and cheese.

50
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,620
It makes me sad because this lady,
she,

51
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,390
she looked like she was probably pretty
when she was younger and she's not that

52
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:10,780
old.

53
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,620
She's probably in her late thirties
maybe early forties but she has turned

54
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:18,340
her face into that a monster,
a monster and there's no going back.

55
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,050
It's rubber,
it doesn't move.

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,230
It's frozen.
It's filled in in weird ways where it

57
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,080
looks like she's got a fucking tooth
ache or something like her face is

58
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:28,610
swollen and she,
you know what the kicker is?

59
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,030
She might've gone in for one thing,
had a weird reaction or whatever and

60
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,300
like now it's like that and she might be
a super cool lady or something and

61
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,400
that's just like,
like you're stuck with,

62
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,960
well you know what I think it is.
I think it's a dysmorphia.

63
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah.
Like the same thing where anorexics

64
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:46,440
habit bodybuilders have it.
Women who have a boob implants a lot of

65
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,510
times never think their boob implants
are big enough.

66
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,880
They want to keep going and going and
going and getting bigger and bigger.

67
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,530
They get,
they get crazy,

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,350
they'll look at them and they're like
not big enough like they,

69
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:56,750
they don't see what everyone else is
seeing.

70
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,950
What we were talking about before about
mma,

71
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,100
I think it's still in a learning period.
I think we still haven't got it down the

72
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,050
way.
Like say football has it down,

73
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,680
they know exactly how to train to
develop like top flight football

74
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,940
players,
basketball,

75
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,680
same thing.
You go to a basketball camp,

76
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:14,320
you're dealing with top flight strength
and conditioning coach.

77
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,050
They really know how to deal with,
I mean there you're dealing with multi

78
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,860
multimillion dollar athletes and they
have that investment and they want to

79
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,820
keep it healthy and really no one should
apply that more than MMA fighters

80
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,860
because who the fuck gets hurt more than
MMA fighters?

81
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,820
Whiteside and Woodside

82
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,500
probably is the worst taught sport in
the world,

83
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,050
especially in Thailand because there's
no history of teaching.

84
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,860
So it was like a is teaching fighters
would they just copied by osmosis

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
pretty.
So it was like,

86
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,320
that's one of the posts backwards sports
in the world.

87
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:43,100
Everyone della Mae and isn't a lot of
smoking and drinking as well.

88
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,420
We had
better,

89
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,770
like they've gotten a lot of um,
you know,

90
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,840
fight against alcohol,
flight gets drugs.

91
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,050
This is a lot of promotion.
Now you've got a lot of guys like

92
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:58,070
[inaudible] Mallett pedal.
He's actually American,

93
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,840
um,
you know,

94
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,090
add [inaudible] and these guys are
heroes.

95
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,070
So for people there's a lot more push
towards the be healthy,

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,660
get fit.
You could make good money.

97
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:12,230
Now go to Japan,
you can fight in American dude dives.

98
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,100
Yeah.
I have friends that,

99
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,050
that trained in font in Thailand and
they were telling me about everybody

100
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:19,050
smoking cigarettes.
And I have my friend Chris started

101
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,510
smoking when he was in Thailand because
he's fighting,

102
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,850
he's fighting in Thailand.
Everybody was training and smoking and

103
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,800
he starts smoking too.
Just like to be one of those gangs right

104
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,780
now.
He smoked cigarettes,

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,450
you know Cha Champa cat,
some grit,

106
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:31,470
you know,
I've heard the name,

107
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,160
he's already like Tom Post sort of base
where we were.

108
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,080
Oh really?
Yeah,

109
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,620
we broke rick,
Rufus,

110
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,560
his leg.
You've seen the fight.

111
00:04:37,561 --> 00:04:40,270
I'm sure you're the one who when he puts
him in the,

112
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,360
and he breaks his leg the fall.
I didn't see that.

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,980
It's on youtube.
It's worth watching.

114
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:47,130
But we saw him and he's a,
he's a legend before Andy Hook for all

115
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:47,964
these cars.
Right.

116
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,790
We go to Thailand and Petaja and he's
just sitting there smoking.

117
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:54,630
So if I buy him a box of cigarettes,
he'll let me film him kicking the bag.

118
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,540
So just bring a box of cigarettes and he
kicked the bag for me.

119
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,100
Show me the technique,
you know,

120
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,430
like they're just smoking and alcohol
over there is out of control.

121
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,310
Wow.

122
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,000
There at the moment,
being on the top of it in industry,

123
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,760
especially in an industry that's
involved in technology is a very

124
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,530
precarious position.
You know,

125
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,810
if you talked to,
um,

126
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,760
Kodak a decade ago,
do you think they would,

127
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
they would realize that suddenly it's
the largest vendor or manufacturer of

128
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:27,760
cameras in the world would be a
telephone company.

129
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,320
Nokia,
Nokia,

130
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:34,321
within three years became the world's
largest maker of cameras and suddenly

131
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,790
the entire industry changed.
Right.

132
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,940
And how do you compete against that?
They're not even in your industry.

133
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,820
They just came out of left field.
It's like you're suddenly the horse

134
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,350
buggy manufacturer and Ford is taking
your business and you never expected

135
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,510
that was going to happen.
Well Nokia has a,

136
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,590
has a

137
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,480
camera phone now,
a windows phone that is some insane

138
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,440
amount of pixels.
It's like 40 fucking megapixels or

139
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:01,910
something.
Some crazy 41 41 megapixel says Jamie.

140
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,780
Jamie is on top of that shit.
41 fucking megapixels on a phone.

141
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,330
I mean this thing I think has of the
note three,

142
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,360
I think it has 12 or something.
You know,

143
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:14,120
it's better than that.
Are you familiar with Moore's law?

144
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes.
So,

145
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,880
so for,
for your listeners to Moore's law,

146
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:20,520
it was created by Gordon Moore,
pro processors,

147
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:21,630
right?
Processing speed.

148
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,600
And yeah,
and what he said was that he estimated

149
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:28,200
that because of the way silicon works,
every 18 months,

150
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,760
the speed of a computer with double or
the price would drop by half.

151
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,660
And that has been true now for more than
25 years.

152
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,920
Wow.
And,

153
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,940
and that thing then plays out in camera
megapixels,

154
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,910
in storage on SD cards,
in the size of the,

155
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,020
of your smartphone,
in the,

156
00:06:47,021 --> 00:06:49,940
a number of sensors you can put into the
smartphone.

157
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,560
And it's battery.
Battery life is the one that's lagging

158
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:54,780
behind.
And it's the main thing that's holding

159
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,900
back this technology.
Moore's law also applies to things like

160
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:00,450
bitcoin.
It also applies to networks like the

161
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,390
Internet.
And what it means is that if you're in

162
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:06,540
an industry that's established and
suddenly you have a competitor that's

163
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,730
coming at you with the power of Moore's
law,

164
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,540
you better watch out because you're in,
it's not a matter of whether you will be

165
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:16,170
able to compete in a decade.
It's a matter of whether your industry

166
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,540
will still exist in a decade.
Right?

167
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,680
Yeah.
Isn't that fascinating?

168
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:23,440
That whole industries can just vanish

169
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,410
hundred and 50 years of Kodak and then
suddenly film doesn't exist.

170
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,143
God,

171
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:32,470
okay.
