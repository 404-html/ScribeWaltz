00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello Freak bitches,
you know,

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:04,530
that is real.
I mean,

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,270
it's,
that's not just in this talk,

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,300
that's not talk where you zig zagged.
Um,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,160
and you know,
Roy Roy's story is a perfect example of

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:16,640
that and explain who roy is.
Um,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,570
roy is,
he's who got me started in bow hunting

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,540
and he is the toughest man I've ever
met.

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,840
I've shared more experiences with Roy
and the mountains.

10
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,740
He's life to finding type experiences
that,

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,950
that we've talked about.
And you know,

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,740
the,
the bond we've created together has been

13
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,020
over a handful of experiences,
you know,

14
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,630
and you,
you realize when you're out of your

15
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:43,200
comfort zone like that and when you're
both so committed to a pursuit,

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,630
those bonds form quickly,
you know?

17
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:50,130
And so we've formed a strong bond over a
handful of experiences over a couple of

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,330
years will really,
and I,

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,920
um,
you know,

20
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:57,270
we went to high school together,
we started bow hunting as I think 18,

21
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:01,440
19 years old and had hundreds of
experiences,

22
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,360
life changing life,
defining experiences together over the

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,360
year.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,560
So our bond naturally was like brothers
and,

25
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,970
um,
you know,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,320
he,
he was,

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,830
when everybody doubted me when I was
growing up and doubted my dream of ever

28
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:20,730
becoming anything,
he never did.

29
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,480
He was always,
he was always the guy that believed in

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,580
me.
Well,

31
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,750
this year of sheep hunting,
he was up sheep hunting where we had

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,000
sheep hunted before together and I
killed around.

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,020
And it was,
you know,

34
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,630
it's a tough,
difficult,

35
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,310
dangerous hunt.
And He,

36
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,740
uh,
but he's more prepared or he was more

37
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,900
prepared for hunt's like that than
anybody in the world.

38
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,900
He's done it.
He's done it as much as anyone that I

39
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:48,660
know and I've been successful.
I think he's killed,

40
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,750
had killed nine rams and he one misstep.
He fell and died,

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,520
um,
prime of his life,

42
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,310
essentially 49 years old.
Um,

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,590
just,
you know,

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,660
uh,
father,

45
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:05,700
husband,
three kids,

46
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,380
somebody who,
even the toughest Alaska hunters looked

47
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,500
up to one step gone.

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,660
And that's,
you know,

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,490
that's so,
it's not just talk,

50
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,900
when you say zig,
you should've zagged.

51
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,000
There's risk,
but that's,

52
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,860
I mean,
if you're going to it,

53
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,750
it just puts everything in perspective.
That's the allure to it because I can

54
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,130
speak for Roya and I,
cause I know we,

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,170
we always have known about the risk.
That was part of the draw is we wanted

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,620
to go where nobody else wanted to go or
do things that nobody else wanted to do.

57
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:42,270
That was the only thing that made us
difference.

58
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,790
And it goes back.
That made us different.

59
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,840
That's,
and it goes back to,

60
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,890
you know,
the level,

61
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:48,150
the playing field.
Well,

62
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,380
we felt like,
well,

63
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:52,260
if we would go and do the hardest hunts
and the toughest conditions,

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,320
nobody else would want to do that.
But we would,

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,870
all of a sudden we were calling the
shots,

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,630
we call the shots of the mountain calls,
the shots and all that,

67
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,460
that hunt the mountain.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
One at Roy fell and he died.
And it's a if fell 700 feet.

69
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,030
Right?
Yeah.

70
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,870
Yeah.
It's uh,

71
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,160
you know,
that where he fell just tough,

72
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,260
unforgiving sheep country.
And um,

73
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,723
you know,
once you,

74
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,760
once you start going there,
you're not going to stop.

75
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,103
And,
um,

76
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,140
it's one of the most dangerous hunts
sheep.

77
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

78
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,903
It's,
uh,

79
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,850
you know,
uh,

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,390
on that hunt specifically,
they give a hundred tags and a lot of

81
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:37,900
times there's this one sheep killed.
It's that difficult.

82
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,720
And it,
and I think 40% of the people never even

83
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,910
go because of the weather,
because of the conditions,

84
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,970
because it's so hard.
So they draw the tag and don't even get

85
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:48,640
up the hill.
It wasn't that there was a case with you

86
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,240
when you went up there grizzly hunting,
you were supposed to go sheep hunting as

87
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:52,960
well,
right?

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,890
Yeah,
no,

89
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,850
it was moose hunting Moose.

90
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,240
We were going to do a moose sheep Combo,
but there's so much snow we couldn't

91
00:03:58,241 --> 00:04:00,070
even get to sheep country.
And,

92
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:02,320
um,
that was a plan where we're going to go

93
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:03,700
sheep hunting.
And that was with Roy.

94
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,140
That was with Roy.
Right.

95
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,370
So we had,
you know,

96
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,990
an amazing moose hunt together and I
killed a nice big bowl.

97
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,230
Um,
we just had just a,

98
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,720
just another epic adventure,
something,

99
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,450
you know,
a haunt that maybe a handful of people

100
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,120
would want to do because we were so far
back,

101
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,300
you know,
miles back and had to haul a moose out

102
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,480
over a mountain in the snow.
Uh,

103
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,620
very,
very,

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,030
very difficult.
Huh.

105
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,980
But the ones,
it was just,

106
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,780
it def,
it was perfect because it's our last

107
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:38,170
hunt together.
He died two weeks later and that hunt

108
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,590
and capsulated everything about us,
it was just hard.

109
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,830
It was miserable and it was rewarding
and,

110
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,880
and you know,
we achieved success were not very many

111
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,550
people would have and we did it together
and uh,

112
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,680
yeah,
I mean,

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,840
and then two weeks laters was his sheep.

114
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,800
Putin,
there was an iconic photo that I think

115
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,830
was forever going to define you from
that hunt with you,

116
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,490
the big cut in your face and blood
streaming down your face and you send it

117
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:08,020
to me while you were out there.
Yeah.

118
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,570
You were,
you're saying we have,

119
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,170
we haven't gotten one yet.
Yeah,

120
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,660
we're out here hustling.
Yeah.

121
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,280
And,
uh,

122
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,280
there's this photo of you looking
grizzled as fuck with blood coming down

123
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,320
your face.
Snow in the background.

124
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,341
Yeah.
And I'm like,

125
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,174
uh,
yeah,

126
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,010
that's,
that's Cameron Hanes.

127
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,770
It,
it is because enrollment,

128
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,240
I always would,
we would always say we can make an easy

129
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:36,190
hunt hard cause we wanted it to be hard
when you went into an area where very

130
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,800
few people were having success.
And even with rifles,

131
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,930
you're going deep,
deep until area.

132
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,420
It was a rifle area.
So that means you,

133
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,530
I bow hunter had a different size of
animal that was legal.

134
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,350
If you're hunting with a Ra.
So if you're hunting in this area,

135
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,600
it was a rifle area,
had to be a little bigger,

136
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:55,420
so I had to be 50 inches wide but had to
have four brow tine switch.

137
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,830
So you're,
you're,

138
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,170
you're making it harder.
So we were there and there in the rifle

139
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,360
area and we got it done.
And it was,

140
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,780
it was the hunt that it was a hunt that
that's what we love.

141
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:09,230
We loved hard,
we just loved the test.

142
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,810
I mean a moose is,
well,

143
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,420
how am I pounds of that thing way.
We had about 600 pounds of meat.

144
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,170
Just the meat,
just the meat.

145
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,700
I mean,
how much did the animal way?

146
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,500
Oh,
I dunno.

147
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,000
Over,
I mean 1200 pounds,

148
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,260
probably a thousand people.
I Dunno.

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,600
It's an enormous,
enormous animal.

150
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,520
Until you see one,
like in,

151
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,320
you're there physically next to it.

152
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,640
You don't realize.
No,

153
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,200
we,
it took us hours to break,

154
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,100
you know,
I killed it.

155
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,470
Um,
it was in the evening and,

156
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:38,180
uh,
Roy and I,

157
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:40,070
we had cameraman there,
but they ended up just,

158
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,850
they filmed a little bit of the,
uh,

159
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,320
the process of breaking it down.
Then they headed back to the spike camp

160
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,730
and,
uh,

161
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,930
Roy and I stayed there,
which we like just doing it by ourselves

162
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:55,340
back there together,
saying in just saying,

163
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,970
he would always say,
I don't really,

164
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,250
uh,
what kinds of stuff that he's saying

165
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,270
know country girl shake for me.
Little Luke Bryan and maybe little

166
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,320
little,
uh,

167
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,930
lady Gaga,
I think.

168
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:08,990
Oh God.
Yeah.

169
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,160
He,
he was,

170
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,960
uh,
well versed,

171
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,610
terrible singer,
but it was,

172
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,110
it's just what we did.
Right.

173
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,630
You know,
just part of the part of the deal.

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,280
You were happy.
Oh,

175
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,410
successful hunt.
It was,

176
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,420
you know,
God,

177
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,320
you know,
I'm just gonna,

178
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,970
I'm gonna miss those times with him
because,

179
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:36,971
uh,
it's just hard knowing that the journey

180
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,960
we'd been through together.

181
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,090
That's why it's so appreciated.
And you know who else?

182
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,720
I know there's another example of we
hunted this year and hunted the Brown

183
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:50,310
bear together and uh,
he,

184
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,590
he,
uh,

185
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:56,830
I killed this bear.
This Sao went over and was attacking the

186
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,670
corpse of the bear,
but the bear died.

187
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,250
She didn't know what was going on.
She smelled blood,

188
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,150
just went crazy.
The,

189
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,050
these brown bear are there,
big predators.

190
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,200
Something goes in their head,
it's going to have an issue.

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,270
So she hurt when I shot the bore,
it made a noise.

192
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,840
It sorta ran towards her.
She stood up,

193
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,740
didn't know what was going on,
knew he had made this noise.

194
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:26,030
So she ran towards where he was.
Well as soon as she hit his path,

195
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,400
she smelled the blood from where my
Arrow pass through them.

196
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,040
So she tracked him by the blood,
just basically running,

197
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,030
smelling blood,
blood,

198
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:32,570
blood.

199
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,690
She got to him and he had died already.
She started attacking him.

200
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,750
This is just what they do.
These are,

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,470
you know,
these aren't crying,

202
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,540
hugging bear.
And uh,

203
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,630
so she's gone and I'm,
I'm with Roy and I'm like,

204
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,970
I said,
she's turning on my bear and I'm like,

205
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,740
get off my bear.
And I'm yelling to her.

206
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:50,750
I'm like,
you know,

207
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,130
and so I tell Roy,
I'm like,

208
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,510
I said,
we've got to get up.

209
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,500
I said,
shoot out there.

210
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,910
So he shoots boom.
And she's like,

211
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,870
not,
didn't even,

212
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,670
you know,
he didn't shoot at her.

213
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,340
He just was making it just a scare.
Nothing.

214
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,360
Not like,
Hey,

215
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,770
get off that bear.
And she looked up and then she likes

216
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,810
sauce.
All of sudden here she comes sprinting

217
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,970
and it was like,
what is going on?

218
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,400
And uh,
she's like a blood friends.

219
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,130
Yeah.
Just,

220
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,070
it was so much going on at one time and
then it got something triggered in her

221
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:23,400
head and she was just crazy.

222
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,190
So here she comes and I killed my bears
in a creek.

223
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,920
She got to the creek and Roy,
he says,

224
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,970
he says,
if she hasn't stopped long enough

225
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,070
shooter.
And I said,

226
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,130
yeah.
So she comes up to our side of the creek

227
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,890
and not have an arrow knocked and you
know,

228
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,430
ended up,
know what I'm going to do with an Arrow,

229
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:39,211
but it's,
I don't have,

230
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,120
I never packed a gun.
So I just had my bow and he had,

231
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,500
he had the gun,
she stands up at 20 yards away and

232
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,890
we're,
we're standing there and it's,

233
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,010
and it's a standoff.
And so we think,

234
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,630
well,
she stood up,

235
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,910
she's going to see what's going on.
Um,

236
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,670
there was three of us standing there and
she's going to say,

237
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:57,540
okay,
um,

238
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,730
dropped down and leave.
So we were like,

239
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,590
get outta here.
And uh,

240
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,060
she drops down,
beeline right towards us charging.

241
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,590
And so roy,
boom,

242
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,053
and he,
uh,

243
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,100
he drops her,
you know,

244
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:14,310
one shot made a good shot.
He hit like Mr. Head butt hit like right

245
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,420
here and it was folded her right there.
And it was,

246
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,440
what,
what the,

247
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,120
what stands out for me is that,
um,

248
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,330
you know,
we were,

249
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,220
we were never worried about our lives
were at stake.

250
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,080
We were never worried about any,
you know,

251
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,450
like maybe a typical reaction would be
like,

252
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,610
oh my God,
we could have died or something like

253
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,050
that.
I,

254
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,920
I was just like,
I cussed because I'm like,

255
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,720
I was mad she did that and required Roy
to act,

256
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,010
you know,
so I was just,

257
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,020
I cussed and he's like,
he's like,

258
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,190
dude,
I had to,

259
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,130
and uh,
so we were worried about ourselves.

260
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,630
We were just,
we didn't want to have to kill another

261
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:58,830
bear and we weren't nervous about the
situation.

262
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,911
And I'm like,
I said,

263
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,560
I know.
It was like,

264
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,040
where else am I going to have somebody
that's on that same page with me that,

265
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,770
that's common,
that situation and not see their life

266
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:10,720
flash before their eyes.
Just do what you have to do to,

267
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,460
to stop the risk.
That's never gonna happen.

268
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,910
I'm never going to have somebody like
that in my life again.

269
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,070
And I think about,
we were,

270
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,470
you know,
we,

271
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,870
we knew the risks were involved in
everything that we did and we embraced

272
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:29,490
it and we were fine with it and it,
and it didn't consume us or anything.

273
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,920
And that's,
that's what I'm going to miss is having

274
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,330
somebody,
so on my same page that I can trust like

275
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,170
that,
you know,

276
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,720
roy was the best.
You would have to have someone who's

277
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:42,810
experienced that as many times it was
roy has had where it was,

278
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,060
he knew exactly what he had to do that
moment.

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,020
Yeah,
he did.

280
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,570
And he and his people know what they
have to do.

281
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,320
It's,
it's executing that is what's hard,

282
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,201
you know,
and,

283
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,570
uh,
so knowing what it takes,

284
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,840
not panicking,
being in control and then getting the

285
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,990
job done with one shot,
very rare.

286
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,730
And he was,
so roy in those situations was as,

287
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,970
I don't know,
everybody,

288
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:13,600
I haven't been with everybody,
but I would say he's as good as anybody

289
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,490
that I know of,
you know,

290
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,110
and uh,
um,

291
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,240
that's why,
you know,

292
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:22,720
when he fell and I got the news that he
fell and died.

293
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,993
I mean,
I could,

294
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,070
I could believe it I guess,
but I was mad and I'm still mad.

295
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,720
Um,
and I know everything happens for a

296
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,470
reason and I know,
you know,

297
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,530
he has,
he has a lot of faith and I know,

298
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,260
you know,
we want to think everything's going to

299
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:40,510
be okay and we'll see each other again.

300
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,080
I know all that,
but it still makes me mad.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,010
Um,
because,

302
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,040
you know,
we missed or we missed out on a lot of

303
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,030
experiences we'd still love to have.
And we talked about and we were just

304
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:59,530
like,
we had these big,

305
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,660
big goals and big dreams and I'm mad
that that's gone.

306
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,320
So
it's completely,

307
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,350
it's not,
it's not just understandable.

308
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,670
It's,
um,

309
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,770
it's something that very few people
could probably relate to.

310
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:17,740
The kind of intimate friendship that you
would have with someone who's

311
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,980
experienced those kinds of hunts.
It's been in the,

312
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:22,780
in the wilderness.
That's don,

313
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,770
like that Moose Hunt that you were
talking about when you guys were deep,

314
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,090
deep in the,
in the,

315
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,750
in the wilderness like that.
It's,

316
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,410
it's something that very few people will
ever,

317
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,430
very few people ever experienced that,
that kind of danger,

318
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,490
that kind of an intimate moment in the
wilderness.

319
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,750
Just that connection to the wild that
you guys had together.

320
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,560
Right.
And so the whole point I guess with all

321
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:53,410
that is it's people say,
well you just,

322
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,840
you're murderous or you want to kill
such a small part of what me and Roy

323
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:02,890
experience together.
The kills were,

324
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,430
I mean they were,
we achieved our goal.

325
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,160
That was it.
It was the journey.

326
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,470
It was the Brotherhood.
It was,

327
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,910
you know,
growing up.

328
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,060
And that's what,
that's what hunting is.

329
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,010
It's not just you're out killing,
it's,

330
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:21,370
you're experiencing
nature,

331
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,380
its most brutal or it's most rewarding
or the entire gamut.

332
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,410
And when,
when that makes you who you are.

333
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,360
Um,
it's powerful.

334
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,950
And that's,
you know,

335
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,210
that's what hunting was to us.
