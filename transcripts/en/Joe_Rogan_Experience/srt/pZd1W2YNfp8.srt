1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,900
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,600
You don't know what the
fuck they're drawing.

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,400
You just spout some scribbles on a wall.

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,080
You found some of my drawings.

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:09,510
You'd be like,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,200
what?

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
That guy looked like a d.

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,780
There was people that looked like Dick's.

9
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,231
Get that.

10
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:17,880
You see that hand and that not that one
little that Bolo that this drawing pad.

11
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,060
That's some shit I found
from my high school years.

12
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,241
Yeah.

13
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:21,951
That's awesome.

14
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:24,900
Just from when I was like 15 that's crazy.

15
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:25,980
Yeah.

16
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,290
I'll put some skin.

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,230
All this shit in there,

18
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,270
but some of it online or you are a hundred
times better than I was and I did it

19
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:33,660
all the time.

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,493
This was like,

21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,230
this is like from what I was a kid.

22
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,000
It's is a super cat,

23
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:39,420
Huh?

24
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,253
Oh Shit.

25
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,790
It's like some shit that I drew.

26
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,800
I used to draw a lot and that's bad.

27
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,800
It is loosely used to,

28
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,430
uh,

29
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,560
that's what I really
used to want to be is a,

30
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,060
an artist for a comic book.

31
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:52,870
So yeah,

32
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,671
1982.

33
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,970
So I guess I was 15 1982

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,740
I was eight years old.

35
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,080
I was older than you son.

36
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,810
I love how all your shit's monsters.

37
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,580
Scared of monsters,

38
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,190
man.

39
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,023
Yeah.

40
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Goldilocks and the three bears.

41
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,330
I'm going to have to do something with
these cause I don't really draw anymore.

42
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,270
I don't,

43
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,400
here's what a wolf man.

44
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,420
One I was always until werewolves.

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
That's why I was so bummed out that uh,

46
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:28,320
that Benicio Del Toro movie fucking
socks cause it did fucking sack.

47
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,154
Like it didn't happen.

48
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,390
Is that waterfalls?

49
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,050
That's Ninjitsu like you get
this one peeing on the bed,

50
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,180
ping over the bed from the bed.

51
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,014
Ping.

52
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,960
It's like describing are ways to bed.

53
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,830
He's like sitting on the project
that I had to do for school.

54
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,480
I got in trouble all the time because
of was when I was on the wrestling team.

55
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:00,800
I drew the wrestling logo for our
high school wrestling when um,

56
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,850
when I was as well.

57
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:03,190
I also drew the logo for our,

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,033
um,

59
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:04,940
our school.

60
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,730
We had to like tee shirts
for Newton south of line.

61
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,810
So I drew the line.

62
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,740
I used to do that too.

63
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,540
I did a word the wording team,

64
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,543
uh,

65
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,780
Kilborne official bungee jumping shirt,

66
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,430
which was a cardinal bungee jumping.

67
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,100
But,

68
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,490
uh,

69
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,920
that's another one that's
from a picture from,

70
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,970
there's an old,

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,450
uh,

72
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,210
I think it was long Chaney jr or no,

73
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,230
I don't remember which one,

74
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,040
which Werewolf movie maybe was Oliver.

75
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know which one it was.

76
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,080
Some policy.

77
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,350
Oh,

78
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,930
that's bad ass did stuff.

79
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:35,810
I was good at looking color.

80
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,840
You've got to be drew.

81
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,280
But uh,

82
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,810
before,

83
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:40,950
oh,

84
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,870
here's Humpty dumpty,

85
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,240
Humpty dumpty the ax murderer.

86
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,830
I drew a lot of hours.

87
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,420
You put all this shit in your book.

88
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,021
Yeah,

89
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,010
I'll do something with it.

90
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,973
Conan.

91
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,570
That's fun.

92
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,820
That's when I was into
Conan the barbarian now.

93
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,990
So that's amazing.

94
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,311
It's another werewolf.

95
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:58,640
I was fucking obsessed with werewolves
for whatever fucking gay reason.

96
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,740
That's [inaudible] Harris.

97
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,861
I just,

98
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:02,230
uh,

99
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,570
I've always loved the wolf man.

100
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:04,404
And as a result

101
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,640
now werewolf though
wasn't like your father.

102
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,650
I think I was an angry kid and I was
always obsessed with the idea that you

103
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:12,921
could,

104
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:13,370
uh,

105
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,410
I think would represented to me was like,

106
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,281
you know,

107
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:17,114
that you,

108
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,760
you can be calm and normal and then
some shit happens and just right.

109
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,940
And I'll maybe like,

110
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,840
that's what I wanted to do.

111
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:26,840
I wanted to fucking hawk out on
people and turn into a werewolf.

112
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,950
Go mother motherfuckers.

113
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,690
I don't know when you're an angry kid.

114
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Never good.

115
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,530
But I um,

116
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,370
I totally wanted to be
a comic book artist,

117
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,240
but my a high school art
teacher was a Douche bag.

118
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,540
He was just suppressive and
annoying and unhappy and had no joy.

119
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,560
There was no happiness.

120
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,340
This man,

121
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,810
everything was serious.

122
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,060
Like his art was serious and you know,

123
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,080
and he would draw on,

124
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,490
I don't even think he was that talented.

125
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:53,090
He was like,

126
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,950
he would draw like boring shit,

127
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:55,161
you know,

128
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,770
he would like draw like pears and stuff,

129
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:57,981
you know,

130
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,270
like a bowl of fruit bowl.

131
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,673
Hey faggot.

132
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,191
You know,

133
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:02,810
I've got a camera if I want to see fruit,

134
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,200
right,

135
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,220
I'll take a picture of it.

136
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,280
And now let me see it.

137
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:08,120
You got a photo of Wolverine
fight in Spiderman now,

138
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,541
you know,

139
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,310
to shut the fuck up
because that's what I like.

140
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,060
And he was telling me that what I like
was like juvenile and then it was like

141
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,901
foolish.

142
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,250
And then like my co and I was like,

143
00:04:16,251 --> 00:04:18,500
you're just suppressing what I like,

144
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,011
you know?

145
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:20,390
I like watching,

146
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:20,691
you know,

147
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:21,770
fucking monster movies.

148
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:23,300
I like reading comic books.

149
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,770
Is there something wrong with that?

150
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:25,910
It's just an entertainment.

151
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,310
I hate when people pretend that they're
entertainment somehow or another is like

152
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,940
more valid or more sophisticated
just because it's like serious.

153
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,953
You know?

154
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,880
Like people who love serious movies.

155
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:38,720
Like I'm like,

156
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,081
you know,

157
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,850
comp movies so serious when it was like,

158
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,661
whatever,

159
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,200
man,

160
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,090
are you learning something
when you go to see like,

161
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:44,751
like,

162
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,021
you know,

163
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:46,670
some depressing Sean Penn movie.

164
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,470
Are you learning something when you go
to see those movies and everything in

165
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,600
touch with my emotions,

166
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:51,200
Joe,

167
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,310
it was that river movie.

168
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,290
Whatever the fuck river runs through it.

169
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,730
No,

170
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:54,911
the,

171
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,860
the Sean Penn won bomb
mystic mystic river.

172
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,270
Is that what it or whatever.

173
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,021
But it was like,

174
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:00,321
you know,

175
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:00,831
and everyone's like,

176
00:05:00,831 --> 00:05:02,180
it's such an important film.

177
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,170
Like what?

178
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:03,490
What,

179
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:03,920
what's,

180
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,300
what film is important.

181
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah.

182
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:05,871
Okay.

183
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:06,920
They're fucking movies,

184
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:07,311
man.

185
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,230
You go to a movie and enjoy yourself.

186
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,430
You have a good time.

187
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,570
It takes you someplace.

188
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,890
It gives you some thrills,

189
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,480
you know you use a lot of shit,

190
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,400
you don't know what's happening
and things get resolved.

191
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,120
How's this going to,

192
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
what's going to go down?

193
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:18,891
That's all it is.

194
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,060
It's fucking entertainment.

195
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,020
And the idea that your entertainment
because it represents like things that

196
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:27,980
happen in real life as somehow or
another superior to like superheroes are

197
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:28,611
monsters.

198
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:29,600
Like please.

199
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,690
I had a good art teacher that got,

200
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,391
it's funny cause I got,

201
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:36,200
I'll get C's and D's in every class
because I would sleep except for art,

202
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,830
which I straight a pluses took every
class but my teacher was cool and like a

203
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:42,060
lot of my paintings I look
back and I'm like wow,

204
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,190
she let me do this.

205
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:47,580
Like one was called pool table on acid
and she gave me an a minus and it was a

206
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,540
pool table with a monster coming out
of it and everything was melting or

207
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,453
whatnot.

208
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,380
I didn't have to draw for it.

209
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,350
She didn't make me do anything for that.

210
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,310
My teacher to say shit to me.

211
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:58,611
Like,

212
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:58,851
you know,

213
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,001
like,

214
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,301
well,

215
00:05:59,301 --> 00:05:59,781
you know what,

216
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,590
if you get a job where you have to
draw a baby for a diaper commercial,

217
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,810
I want to see you draw a
baby for a diaper commercial.

218
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,370
And I'm like,

219
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,210
oh man.

220
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:13,211
Like why are you fucking telling my sons
do draw a baby for a diaper commercial?

221
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,680
Like is that my future?

222
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,580
Is that w what I have to look forward to?

223
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:17,990
Yeah.

224
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,460
Drawn diaper ads.

225
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,390
Like he was like,

226
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,110
really?

227
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,110
Like my dream was to do
comic book illustrations and
he was telling me basically

228
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,750
you need to have skills because you're
not going to reach those dreams and what

229
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:35,870
if you have a job that's just you as
an illustrator doing boring stuff,

230
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,160
but you have to drop boring stuff.

231
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:37,941
And I was like,

232
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,700
you fucking buzzkill,

233
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:40,880
you know?

234
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,100
And this guy was just a dumpy,

235
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,380
physically out of shape,

236
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,060
unhealthy person.

237
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,220
And he was just just
depressed all the time.

238
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
And so I killed my,

239
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,550
effectively,

240
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,391
I went,

241
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:54,720
I only went for two years,

242
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:54,970
uh,

243
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,350
our,

244
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,911
our class,

245
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,740
I believe it was 14 and 15.

246
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,740
I think by the time I went into
my junior year of high school,

247
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,491
I think I said,

248
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,061
fuck that guy.

249
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:02,731
I'm tired of this.

250
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:02,890
Yeah.

251
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,500
It's annoying.

252
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,680
So I just drew on my own from then
on and that effectively killed my,

253
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,820
my wanting to,

254
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:08,300
uh,

255
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,350
go to school for art.

256
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,520
I had to like was looking at
our colleges and shit and had a,

257
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:12,891
you know,

258
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,200
scholarships lined up and trying
to figure out where to go.

259
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,780
So like the only thing I had a chance
of getting any sort of scholarship,

260
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,800
then meanwhile it's just
teachers and you know,

261
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:26,390
when you don't realize what a gigantic
fucking effect having a good or a shitty

262
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,560
teacher can have on yeah.

263
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,630
But they're,

264
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:28,841
you know,

265
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,360
they're cutting their
salaries over and over again.

266
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:31,891
I just saw it.

267
00:07:31,891 --> 00:07:33,130
They're cutting it again.

268
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,460
Yeah.

269
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,700
And I think teachers should be one
of the most important things ever.

270
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:37,121
You know,

271
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:39,830
like up there with doctors and
stuff that's junk can't tick.

272
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,673
Yeah.

273
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,720
Amazing how we were so short and when it
comes to excited when it comes to that.

274
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,280
Yeah.

275
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,250
What is that you're raising
the child from the beginning.

276
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,600
That should be the most important thing.

277
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,920
Huge people that can
influence your children.

278
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,340
And,

279
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,720
and people that say mean Shit.

280
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:58,410
Like I will never forget I had a math
teacher in high school who was just

281
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,620
fucking boring and the class was boring
and she was this black lady who had a

282
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,130
black accent.

283
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,080
Like she would mispronounce
words all the time.

284
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:11,010
She had terrible grammar and yet she
would like shit all over you if you didn't

285
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:11,844
understand her,

286
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,210
her,

287
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,350
her math problems.

288
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,311
And she,

289
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:14,550
uh,

290
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,320
was in there doing her math problem and
I was bored and I was like drawing or

291
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:19,681
something.

292
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:20,820
And usually that's what I did in class.

293
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:23,730
I would draw on my notebooks
or something and she goes,

294
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,760
she looks up and she sees
me not paying attention.

295
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,080
So she goes,

296
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,010
Mr Rogan,

297
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,610
would you like to come up here and do
both of these problems for the class?

298
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,444
And I said,

299
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,150
you want me to do both of those problems?

300
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,330
Everybody started fucking how Olin.

301
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,980
And so she said,

302
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,780
go down to the Dean's office right now.

303
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:43,081
I said,

304
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,740
okay,

305
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,521
but when I get back,

306
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:45,870
I'm going to do both of those problems.

307
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,720
And everybody was laughing.

308
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,031
She goes,

309
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:48,571
go ahead,

310
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,770
laugh and Mr Wogan,

311
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,600
Mr welcome ain't going nowhere.

312
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,340
He's going nowhere in life.

313
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,971
And I'm like,

314
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:54,810
at least I know how to say,

315
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,820
get out of my classroom.

316
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,840
And she kicked me out of that.

317
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,960
So long as that was like the beginning
of my time as a standup comedian because

318
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,730
I felt like I was defending myself.

319
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:04,080
Like I wasn't doing anything to you.

320
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
I was just sitting there
scribbling in my notebook,

321
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,750
you know?

322
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,990
I just wasn't paying attention because
I was bored out of my fucking head and I

323
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,890
had problems with authority,

324
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,450
but she just liked to be the the lady
to call on you if you ain't paying

325
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,284
attention,

326
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,711
you know,

327
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:17,161
like she would,

328
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:17,850
she would get mad.

329
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,181
But I mean,

330
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,100
meanwhile this fucking
bitch couldn't even speak.

331
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,934
Right.

332
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,380
She said both.

333
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,730
Would you like to come up here and be,

334
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,420
do both of them?

335
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,440
I will never forget it.

336
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:29,490
It's like in my mind it's like a movie
playing out because the anger in my head

337
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:33,240
that this fucking dummy was trying to
make me look dumb in front of everybody

338
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,730
just cause I was scribbling and I
wasn't paying attention to your,

339
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,120
my,

340
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,060
my opinion on math was always like,

341
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,631
okay,

342
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,010
math is very essential,

343
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,430
but don't you have calculators now we do
and isn't there like an endless supply

344
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:44,970
of batteries?

345
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,350
There is done,

346
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,830
right?

347
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,500
Like I'm done.

348
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:47,850
I've,

349
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,730
there's only a finite amount of things
to pay attention to in the day and I

350
00:09:50,731 --> 00:09:54,390
don't give a fuck about these wacky
equations that you're making me solve and

351
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:54,781
figure out.

352
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:55,560
I know how to add.

353
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,490
I know how to divide.

354
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,450
I know how to multiply.

355
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,340
Like is it or are we done here?

356
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,720
Do I have to keep going?

357
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,070
Is this really gonna you're,

358
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,060
you're making me be a fucking square peg
and fit into your fucking round hole.

359
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,541
You know?

360
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,374
It's like I'm not,

361
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,300
I don't want to do what you want me to do.

362
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,710
Like this is nonsense.

363
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,670
It's weird nowadays.

364
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,730
I can't even imagine going to school
with Google because then I'd be like,

365
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,001
no,

366
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:15,930
I don't want to learn it.

367
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,670
I could just search it if I need it.

368
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,980
I don't get what you,

369
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,520
that was a problem.

370
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,370
I used to watch a lot of documentaries
even when I was a kid and I got in

371
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,031
trouble again.

372
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,370
Like people are still like your
comedian where your class clown.

373
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,930
Like I was not really class clown.

374
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,430
What I used to do though is draw a
lot of cartoons about our teachers,

375
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,300
like getting involved,

376
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:33,870
doing shit.

377
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,780
And we had this one teacher
that was really annoying,

378
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:40,920
Mr Hallman and h o l m a n very serious,

379
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,690
but he was wrong about a lot of shit.

380
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,591
And I was,

381
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:43,981
you know,

382
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,210
I was fucking 15 years old and uh,

383
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:46,681
I was,

384
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:47,220
uh,

385
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
in class and I was again
bored out of my fucking mind.

386
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:52,890
He had a science class but at least
science classes a little more interesting.

387
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,380
And he started going on about Lake Erie.

388
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,130
Lake Erie is a dead
lake and this and that.

389
00:10:56,131 --> 00:10:58,770
And you started talking about all the
pollution that's involved in Lake Erie.

390
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,401
And I said,

391
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,100
well actually I just saw a
documentary that was on PBS.

392
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,020
It was talking about the
resurgence of Lake Erie,

393
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,140
about how leaky or they've worked very
hard to filter out the water and they've

394
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,810
done all these different things to cut
down on the pollutants and they've seen a

395
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,650
resurgence and,

396
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,450
and the the fish population.

397
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,730
And he got all fucking mad at me.

398
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,301
And I was like,

399
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,350
have you seen this documentary?

400
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,561
He goes,

401
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:16,711
no,

402
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,580
this is not true.

403
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,031
And I'm like,

404
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:18,170
my,

405
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,991
I know it's not true.

406
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:19,890
It's on PBS.

407
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:20,940
I watched it last night,

408
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:21,240
right?

409
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm like,

410
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,080
aw man.

411
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,501
All right,

412
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,311
so you're just like them.

413
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,020
So the next time we're in class,

414
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,560
um,

415
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,270
he had like these things that would
pull down like projection screens and I

416
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,810
pulled the projection screens
up and I drew cartoons of him

417
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,870
and then I pulled the
projection down and covered him.

418
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,700
So he wants to draw on the chalkboard.

419
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,080
And as he pulled the chalkboard up,

420
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,600
there's all these fucking cartoons ahead,

421
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,290
like saying wacky shit.

422
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,790
And he had this thing that he would do,

423
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,740
like who would do this,

424
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,070
this crazy thing with his hands.

425
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,540
We would move his hands like this.

426
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,710
And then I have this other teacher,

427
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,351
Mr. White,

428
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:54,790
and he was only like five foot two.

429
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,260
So I drew him all the time,

430
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:58,510
but every time I drew them I
drew him standing on something,

431
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,710
standing on a box or standing,

432
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,471
got a chair,

433
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:01,981
a standing guy.

434
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:02,814
It's doable.

435
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,200
And I drew a just like him.

436
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,230
It's so funny.

437
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:05,790
Did

438
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,220
and I had a one in
anthropology teacher who,

439
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:08,550
uh,

440
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,070
was obsessed with Jane
Goodall and the monkeys.

441
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:11,251
You know,

442
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:13,050
Jane Goodall lived live with chimpanzees.

443
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,380
So I drew this one kid who was his
football player who was a nice kid,

444
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:18,930
but he was always kissing her ass cause
he wanted her to like him so he could

445
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:19,764
get better grades.

446
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,820
So I drew him,

447
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,410
banging her and uh,

448
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,910
like it was like and look like her.

449
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,770
It looked like him and
I drew him bagging her,

450
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:26,190
say,

451
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,520
you know,

452
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:26,940
she was like,

453
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,180
oh,

454
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,040
give it to me monkeys.

455
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,860
Pass it around the class.

456
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,520
You know,

457
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,360
like I got suspended on two separate
occasions for drawing cartoons.

458
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,050
That's fine.

459
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,310
I got sent home for time.

460
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,740
That's the only thing I would
normally get in trouble for him.

461
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:40,640
I did the same things,

462
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:41,750
but with overhead projectors,

463
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:43,880
I was like dead some penises,

464
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,260
there's an Indian guy in our class.

465
00:12:45,261 --> 00:12:49,190
I always make fun of his carts because
he had really bad farts and then one time

466
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:50,750
they pulled the whole class
out and they're were like,

467
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,460
all right.

468
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,800
Uh,

469
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Omar has really bad gas because of his
diet and it's not funny and if you guys

470
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,270
make fun of it anymore,

471
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,590
you guys are all gonna be in trouble.

472
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,120
I remember the speech.

473
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:06,200
So of course then I only drew Omar for
the rest of the year after all this

474
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,350
Indian guy pardon?

475
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,630
On people and stuff like that.

476
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,730
How ridiculous is that you,

477
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:13,250
you tell them kids not to make
fun of farts cause it's not fun.

478
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,084
I know.

479
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,800
How disingenuous is that.

480
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,900
You cannot tell someone
that farts are funny.

481
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,550
As soon as you say farts are funny,

482
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,630
I'm not listening to you.

483
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,150
Right?

484
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,070
Because you're not being honest.

485
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,520
Yeah.

486
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,440
You could say farts don't smell.

487
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,450
Can you imagine if he love smog farts?

488
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:26,600
This,

489
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,230
the people that do this,

490
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:29,180
like fart porn.

491
00:13:29,181 --> 00:13:30,014
Have you ever seen far?

492
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,400
You're right as far porn where dudes get
their head right and gross faces in the

493
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,690
growth part in their mouths.

494
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,201
God,

495
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,640
and get such a hard on now.

496
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,043
Okay.

497
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,290
[inaudible].
