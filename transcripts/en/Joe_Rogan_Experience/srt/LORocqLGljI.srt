1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,820
but as an individual,

3
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:06,840
those jobs almost exist to let you know
that you for sure don't want to do that.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,730
It's like the feeling of it being,

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,680
it's like being in a
real bad relationship,

6
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,190
right?

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,641
Like what?

8
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,170
What gets you out of a relationship?

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,580
It he fucking explode.

10
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,420
That's what happens.

11
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,830
You get to a certain point where you like,

12
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:19,560
will you just shut the
fuck up and leave me alone?

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,570
I can't take it as negativity anymore.

14
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,560
We're done.

15
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,393
We're done here.

16
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,660
Okay.

17
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,493
We boom.

18
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,770
Like you have to hit this.

19
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,520
Well,

20
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,910
you got to hit the bottom 15 in order
to change and you've got to have that

21
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,850
Mcdonald's job to appreciate
a really good job.

22
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,950
It's great to talk about later.

23
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,790
Like you and I,

24
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,410
we talked about our first jobs.

25
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,810
It gave you the motivation to get up,

26
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,700
get on your fucking horse
and get out of there.

27
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:41,920
Yeah.

28
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,440
If you didn't have that motivation,

29
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,470
and that's where when we're talking
about money like our society designed to

30
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,210
sort of encourage motivation
which encourages success,

31
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:55,980
which encourages financial rewards and
encourages you more attractive to the

32
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,980
opposite sex when you're driving
a Ferrari to a lot of checks.

33
00:00:58,981 --> 00:00:59,581
That's a fact.

34
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,930
A lot of people get really mad at that,

35
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:01,950
but that's a fact.

36
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,480
It's just the fact,

37
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,200
I mean there's just too many dudes who
are ugly and old who have really hot

38
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:07,591
wives,

39
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,801
right?

40
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,850
I mean it's just fact.

41
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,270
Guys get billions of dollars in giant
yachts and their fucking these hot chicks

42
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:13,200
and it doesn't make any sense,

43
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,280
but that's a fact.

44
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,290
You can't deny that fact.

45
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,950
Why is that fact exists?

46
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:18,420
What exists?

47
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,540
Because we've got a weird system that a
weird system and that's one of the holes

48
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,374
in the system.

49
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,280
One of the holes in the system is that
achievement as as superseded actual

50
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:29,820
physical desire for a lot of these poor
gold diggers and they let this wrinkly

51
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,821
old cock sucker shoot his dry loads into
you and you got to pretend you love it.

52
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,850
Maybe.

53
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,683
Oh yeah.

54
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,310
Putting them out,

55
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,100
baby you while you're like you like that
guy who got his face farted on through

56
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,934
up at Naga.

57
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,810
That's what you think and this old man
fucking creeps on you and he doesn't

58
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,340
shower on purpose just
to degrade you for today.

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,860
If it's all about the money.

60
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,161
Yeah,

61
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:50,850
why did he suck?

62
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,260
Suck it now baby.

63
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,531
Well,

64
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,170
there's a lot of guys that definitely
have a resentment towards these

65
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:55,920
goaltenders.

66
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,221
Yeah,

67
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:56,701
for sure.

68
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,200
Especially once the woman's,

69
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,950
the fun has worn off of the game of
pretending you're attracted to the man,

70
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,510
which you know,

71
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,630
if you're a guy who's not attractive
and you're successful and you believe in

72
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:11,100
your head that you're something cool,

73
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,030
there's something special about you.

74
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,760
Look how well I've done
and this defines me,

75
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,740
this watch to just watched a $50,000
watch and this is a fucking $20 million

76
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:22,590
state and you get that shit in your head
and you get a girl and she tricks you

77
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:23,400
with your own ego.

78
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,860
She can get baby you just
amazing to be a brown.

79
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:27,180
I'm just so lucky we met each other.

80
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:27,780
Meanwhile,

81
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,890
she is perfect.

82
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:33,891
Her tits or just melons bobbing
gently in this really strange,

83
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,510
thin material clothes that she wears,

84
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:41,511
the clings of her hips and just inches
lower than her vagina just hanging inches

85
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:42,671
lower than her vagina,

86
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:46,770
her bubble ass and perfect
leg gap under the pussy hose.

87
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,930
Jesus Christ.

88
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,140
And She just strokes your cock
kisses you and you're like,

89
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,040
I'm marrying this bitch.

90
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,990
She Ain't g yes,

91
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,320
yes,

92
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,960
yes.

93
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,470
Ties.

94
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,090
He's like tire.

95
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,020
She's so,

96
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,170
she gets that Ra

97
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,110
and that's the thing is
you realize with her,

98
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:04,030
not only am I getting the fucking body,

99
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,070
I'm getting shoulder rubs,

100
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:08,770
I'm getting subservient to bitch can cook.

101
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,360
She treats the help.

102
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:10,990
Well,

103
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,010
she gets it and you can go out with her
and she knows how to treat your friends.

104
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,173
She knows how

105
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,680
you and your sleep because she realizes
that she's tricked you into having a

106
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,101
Shitty,

107
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:26,040
we'll where she gets paid because your
kids are the year she convinced you the

108
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,290
kids would be better off if you didn't
give them a safety net because that would

109
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,490
make them successful like you.

110
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,400
So she played to your ego and you cut
the kids out of the will and gave all the

111
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:37,430
money in crazy tie bitch who starts
slowly poisoning your drink and she,

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,250
she earned it.

113
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:42,690
That's the thing about like Anna Nicole
Smith when his fucking stupid kids want

114
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,510
it as a state.

115
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,050
No,

116
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,850
Anna Nicole was stuck in his,

117
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,280
didn't,

118
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,591
didn't you?

119
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,630
Still a bit about this.

120
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,643
Fuck yeah,

121
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,550
closers 19 what was it?

122
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,000
What was the whole thing
about them saying like,

123
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,931
oh my God,

124
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:55,310
she's taking advantage of him.

125
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:56,120
She's only been,

126
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,560
she's only with him for his money.

127
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,131
I'm like,

128
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:02,930
don't you think he fucking knows it
kind of made $1 billion from scratch.

129
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,790
Chances are he's a tad crafty and it
was like this whole thing about like how

130
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,730
you want to die.

131
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,300
Do you'd want to get shaking and a low
in your hospital bed surrounded by loved

132
00:04:11,301 --> 00:04:16,301
ones or do you want to get
a big Fat Kentucky Fried
Hooker and just blow it out?

133
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
And it was all him dying
telling her to lick his ass.

134
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:24,500
All the different shit he did
to her right before he died.

135
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,210
And the kids if that nothing.

136
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
And they think they deserve.

137
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,580
You were raised with
all that fucking money.

138
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:30,960
You went to private schools,

139
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:32,250
you had tennis coaches,

140
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,600
he probably bought you houses.

141
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,890
Why do you need more?

142
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:36,090
What the fuck did you do?

143
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:36,860
You didn't suck.

144
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah,

145
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,410
you need to get your own money.

146
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:38,890
Stupid.

147
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,161
Right?

148
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,780
He rode the ride and now it's over.

149
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,960
And I think also this,

150
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:43,960
it sounds fucked up,

151
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:48,610
but that exists because
it's a predatory situation.

152
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,020
You're,

153
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,853
you're prey.

154
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,591
You know,

155
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,760
if you are vulnerable,

156
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,211
old,

157
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:52,570
weak,

158
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,630
emotional guy who also has $1 billion,

159
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,070
we weren't going to prey on you.

160
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,900
They're going to pretend to
be something they're not.

161
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,810
And they might even been
convinced themselves that
they are that something that

162
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,860
they're pretending to be because their
instinct to try to acquire your wealth

163
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:10,861
and your social status is so strong
that they want to be the Trump girl.

164
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,990
They want to be the new girl
that Trump leaves his wife for

165
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,631
black and white.

166
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:15,871
I mean,

167
00:05:15,871 --> 00:05:18,300
if you're a woman that
grew up in that paradigm,

168
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:22,500
maybe your dad had money and your mother
was a stay at home mom and maybe she

169
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:26,610
had a a a hint of that and then all of
a sudden you're involved in charitable

170
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:29,160
organizations and you're
taking his wealth and you're,

171
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,920
you're channeling it to
positive things so you,

172
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,720
it starts to not necessarily be about
is see the one I would've married just

173
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:39,660
based on his looks and his charisma,

174
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,430
but it starts to become about like,

175
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:41,611
well,

176
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:44,900
life is pairing up with
somebody and being powerful.

177
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,530
He watched house of cards.

178
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,071
No,

179
00:05:47,071 --> 00:05:47,491
I haven't,

180
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:47,761
don't,

181
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:51,960
don't you fucking spoiler alert me to
say the relationship is about power.

182
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,711
I know that movie,

183
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:54,690
the show brother is
supposed to be amazing.

184
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,620
Amazing.

185
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,760
Jumping onto it next,

186
00:05:56,761 --> 00:06:00,770
but basically about how a couple can
be together because there are a power

187
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:02,150
couple and it's interesting.

188
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,800
Bill and Hillary most likely,

189
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:04,090
right?

190
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,460
Right.

191
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,970
Most likely.

192
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,600
Absolutely.

193
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,200
Mom,

194
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,160
most presidents,

195
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,870
I think probably you have to be,

196
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,760
I don't think you can do
that thing on your own.

197
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,440
I think that's a nutty fucking job.

198
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,720
And the first lady has a
prominent role in our culture.

199
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:14,901
I mean,

200
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,901
she's constantly speaking and doing these
things and I think you're dead right.

201
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,710
I think you're dead right about that.

202
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,550
And I think,

203
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,360
um,

204
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
it's also that we're also talking about
just two stops on a broad range of

205
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:33,731
possibilities from ultimately totally
evil Russian hot prostitute who steals

206
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:38,090
your organs when you're asleep to
someone who just doesn't want to work.

207
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,170
And the guys kind of cool and he treats
her good and so she stays with them.

208
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,540
Yeah.

209
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:41,841
You know,

210
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:41,971
I'm,

211
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:42,890
I've seen both.

212
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,671
I've seen both.

213
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,300
I've seen,

214
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,780
I've seen people get victimized and I've
seen people that are just in sort of

215
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:50,570
these relationship where
I wouldn't want it,

216
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,770
but it works for them.

217
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,830
Sometimes they're out in the other one
that the woman will tease and be like,

218
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,280
oh,

219
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,113
how'd he sat?

220
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,601
You know,

221
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,760
I wouldn't be with you if it
wasn't for the fucking money.

222
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,971
Oh,

223
00:06:58,971 --> 00:06:59,920
it's not even a team.

224
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:00,261
He goes,

225
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:02,990
of course I know that that's
a movie that's in a movie.

226
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,130
What was the movie that was in,

227
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,200
there was a movie that
was in where the tune,

228
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:06,531
well,

229
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:06,771
no,

230
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,221
the watch,

231
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,060
Schindler's list terms of Indiana.

232
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,070
You can't even help it.

233
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,200
You do it right away.

234
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,810
Fucking platoon picture into
Oregon's hanging out on the beach.

235
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,130
Um,

236
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,150
I forget the movie man.

237
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,420
Uh,

238
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,380
but it was just about,

239
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,750
about a guy who lost everything
and in the scene like his,

240
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:28,910
his wife was like laughing about
it when everything was going great.

241
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,620
And then when he did lose all the money,

242
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,620
she did fucking leave them.

243
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,160
Well actually it was in the
wolf of Wall Street too.

244
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,200
It's a common theme and
the wolf of Wall Street,

245
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,350
obviously it was a crazy coked
up fucking maniac piece of shit.

246
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,580
But when he was going under and
his business was going under,

247
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,520
that's when the wife left him.

248
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,050
When he was doing great.

249
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,630
The wife wanted him when he
was married to another woman.

250
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,790
I mean like it was,

251
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,110
it was a classic story.

252
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:53,990
So it's not like that's an
unfamiliar paradigm to us.

253
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,853
It's nature.

254
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,980
It's a wounded antelope
that gets taken out by the,

255
00:07:56,981 --> 00:07:57,814
the line.

256
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,340
It's and she needs somebody to
provide for her or she doesn't.

257
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,140
But in that role she does,

258
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,030
if she chooses that role,

259
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,120
if she chooses the role of fucking the
old wrinkly shaky man with his fucking

260
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,420
Pale translucent dick
that he sticks inside,

261
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,940
we could see as he's coming,

262
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,970
could see the veins like pump whatever
blood they've got and it's like a little

263
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,610
highway going down his fucking
Saran wrap skin filled with Viagara.

264
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,021
Yeah,

265
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:28,910
and just shooting dust
bubbles into her pussy.

266
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,193
Yeah.

267
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,950
Yeah man.

268
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,330
I mean that's something her nipples,

269
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,310
you can take that choice or you know,

270
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,190
you could start an art gallery and
become a multimillionaire on your own.

271
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:37,401
I mean,

272
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,240
you could do that too.

273
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,270
You know it's,

274
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,210
but when you are that girl,

275
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,691
okay,

276
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:46,691
if you are that 25 year old girl than
Adderall problem that's looking to try to

277
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:50,480
hook up with some old billionaire dude
and marry him so they'd be taken care of

278
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,170
for life.

279
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,720
You're that.

280
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,520
That's your role.

281
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,480
That's what you've chosen.

282
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,170
You might have more potential than that,

283
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,760
but it doesn't mean that
that's not what you've chosen.

284
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,061
Oh,

285
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,751
you don't even know,

286
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:58,051
baby.

287
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:59,010
She's so slick.

288
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,120
She's so smart.

289
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,361
I mean,

290
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,490
that is one of the smartest
girls I've ever met in my life.

291
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,820
When she met him and she put together,

292
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,983
it doesn't matter.

293
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,843
You're talking nonsense.

294
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,980
She's still that girl.

295
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,720
She's a prostitute.

296
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,481
You can't say no,

297
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:09,541
no,

298
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:09,691
no.

299
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:09,961
Listen,

300
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,330
you can't say she's a prostitute
and I know her and she's powerful.

301
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,610
And what she did was like,

302
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,440
she's really clever and she figured
out what admit be like guys.

303
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:16,870
No,

304
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,931
no,

305
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,071
no.

306
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:17,904
She's still prostitute.

307
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,960
You're missing the whole point,

308
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,260
right?

309
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,710
So it doesn't matter if
she has all this potential.

310
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,650
She reads 150 bucks a week.

311
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,160
Okay,

312
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,320
don't fucking tell me that
girl is so goddamn smart.

313
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,860
Oh my God.

314
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,940
You're saying she's not smart.

315
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,470
Go see she's a hooker.

316
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,150
She's playing the role of a hooker

317
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,950
beset in terms of a female and a male,

318
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,980
because sometimes women are so hot that
the guy is getting something out of her

319
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,210
and he's putting up with not,

320
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,590
not having love,

321
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,300
not having respect for her,

322
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,890
but wanting that pussy so bad or that
status of being with somebody that's that

323
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,360
hot that it is.

324
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:51,194
Same Way.

325
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,220
He's a prostitute for what
he's getting from her.

326
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,260
Oh yeah.

327
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,093
There's certainly,

328
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,620
I mean there's exchanges other
than money that are unfair.

329
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,710
The reason the old man gets the girl
in the first place is because of his

330
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:03,401
fucking money.

331
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,150
That's it.

332
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,420
So when he's honest vote,

333
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,060
people know what they're getting sort of.

334
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:10,540
But it's not because they're playing
a game called love in the game is BB,

335
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:11,081
I'd love you.

336
00:10:11,081 --> 00:10:12,340
I'm just so happy to be with you.

337
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:12,551
Oh,

338
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:13,384
you love me.

339
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,590
Do you want some Dick?

340
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:15,490
I thought your tech baby.

341
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,670
But in the law they're playing a game.

342
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,040
Somebody wins and the
show is a winner or loser.

343
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,130
He gets pussy drive,

344
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,051
Pussy.

345
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,220
If she drugs him and surprise.

346
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:24,641
Well,

347
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:26,860
it's a matter about
maintaining that relationship.

348
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,780
And this allowing her to
fuck her personal trainer.

349
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,230
Right.

350
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,190
He's going to share.

351
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:30,431
Okay.

352
00:10:30,431 --> 00:10:32,230
She's going to look how hot she is.

353
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,460
She's got this little waste,

354
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,390
this dynamic body.

355
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:38,100
She's 25 years old and you're
90 she's gonna fuck her trainer.

356
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,190
Just accept it.

357
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,260
Be happy that you could fuck
her and don't ask questions.

358
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,120
Hagar is supposed to work out early out,

359
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:49,240
open dosed with just this smile.

360
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,260
Yeah.

361
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,710
Ritual,

362
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,460
man.

363
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,410
She won't have to worry.

364
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,610
It's fucking Great Eagle's song,

365
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:55,444
man.

366
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,310
You can't hide your lying eyes man.

367
00:10:57,311 --> 00:10:59,020
It's a fucking jam jam.

368
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,340
Cause when you met your wife,

369
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,170
you were already very successful.

370
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,150
You had money on me.

371
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,193
I had my girl,

372
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,700
I fucked up because I was
single when I met my girl,

373
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,260
my now wife,

374
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,641
and it's fucking,

375
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,250
I had an MTV game shell and I was like,

376
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,390
I met her at the wrong fucking time,

377
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,440
lined up so much.

378
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:23,660
But that's not true because you,

379
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,590
you enjoyed it.

380
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,540
See everybody's worried
about what they are,

381
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,470
but you still do.

382
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,000
But everybody's worried
about what they didn't do.

383
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,490
Right.

384
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,150
This is a no,

385
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,220
I should have done this.

386
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:31,521
No,

387
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,354
you shouldn't have dry.

388
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,200
I've had people in my life to tell
me the most important thing that ever

389
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,210
happened to them was fucking up.

390
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,530
Because if you fuck up,

391
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,030
then you realize you fucked up.

392
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,820
And that's what motivates you to
get away from fucking Mcdonald's.

393
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,960
I should've never done that.

394
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,220
Of course you should have done it.

395
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,421
I lost everything.

396
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:48,800
I fucked up getting that marriage,

397
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:49,071
man.

398
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:50,240
You should have fucking gotten married.

399
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:51,650
You should have lost everything now.

400
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:52,484
You know,

401
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,140
you win.

402
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,441
Now you,

403
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,520
when you got the knowledge,

404
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,480
you'll never let it happen again.

405
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,110
Don't use this as an excuse to
just wallow in your own system.

406
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,810
Then worse than the wallowing
fucking divorce guy.

407
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,021
You know,

408
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,920
he's living in a condo and in Marina del
Ray and he's fucking go to the same bar

409
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,330
every night and the same stuff.

410
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,770
He's one of those guys were like,

411
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,800
the woman at Starbucks knows his name
because his life has become so simplified

412
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,650
and dumbed down because he's afraid
to move forward after a divorce.

413
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,510
Eddie Bravo used to be a DJ,

414
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,930
a strip club when we first met.

415
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,830
And,

416
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,280
um,

417
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,280
Eddie introduced me to the game of how
these girls would go about getting men to

418
00:12:28,911 --> 00:12:29,780
buy them things.

419
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,120
Like I'd be friends with these
girls and knew him through him.

420
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,841
So they were like,

421
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:33,674
they were nice people,

422
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,820
you know,

423
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,250
and I didn't have relationships with them
so I was just talking to them and they

424
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:41,330
would tell me about these guys that
they were hooking up with that would buy

425
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:43,160
them cars and shit and
how they would do it.

426
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:45,480
So I visited him at work and a,

427
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:45,801
I'm like,

428
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:46,634
what's going on man?

429
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,300
And he's like,

430
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,780
ah,

431
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,441
nothing dude.

432
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,274
Check this out.

433
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,320
You're going to talk to this girl.

434
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,280
And then her,

435
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,270
one of her clients,

436
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,260
when she comes in,

437
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,921
like you got it.

438
00:12:54,921 --> 00:12:56,930
You got to see like this
guy just bought her a truck.

439
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,220
He bought her like a Yukon Denali.

440
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,330
And so the girls hanging out and you know,

441
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,191
hanging out with your friends.

442
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,690
And this guy comes in who was,

443
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,770
there's a classic story.

444
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,030
It was a wounded gazelle.

445
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:08,900
55 year old divorce guy works for the
post office coming in with his postal

446
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:09,734
jacket on.

447
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,300
He's norm from cheer.

448
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:14,620
He bought her a $35,000 car man.

449
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,440
And this guy,

450
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,270
he bought her a fucking Yukon Denali,

451
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:17,510
you know,

452
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,343
it was a nice car,

453
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,150
maybe $35,000,

454
00:13:20,151 --> 00:13:20,601
the wrong number.

455
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm just throwing it out there,

456
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,071
whatever it is.

457
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:22,904
He bought her a new car.

458
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,521
So,

459
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:23,810
um,

460
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,730
she sees him and she goes,

461
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,743
oh.

462
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,120
And she runs over like little baby steps,

463
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,920
like a girl and she's fucking naked man.

464
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,491
She's naked.

465
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,211
She's in her underwear.

466
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:37,000
She got a bikini on and she goes
over and gives us guy a hug.

467
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,730
And you could see this guy is defenseless.

468
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,680
There's no way in the world that a girl
that looks like that would ever have

469
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:46,120
that kind of reaction to him.

470
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,290
So he's got to pay for that.

471
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,380
You got to pay for that and you got to
pay for it by buying her a car or taking

472
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:53,560
care of her fucking credit problem
that she's got or you know,

473
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:54,370
do whatever.

474
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,400
You got to figure out how to pay for that
shit because there's no other way that

475
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:58,510
you're going to get that relationship.

476
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,740
But when I watched it,

477
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:00,400
I was like,

478
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,630
I looked at Eddie and he was like,

479
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:02,740
that's shit straight mercenary.

480
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,370
Right.

481
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,761
And I was like,

482
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:04,930
this is crazy.

483
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,033
Like they just,

484
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
they put a con game on these guys.

485
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,790
I got a friend who's like,

486
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,660
he seems to like make friends
with rich people and I,

487
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,050
he's a good guy but it's weird.

488
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,213
And uh,

489
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,200
he says that a few of these guys,

490
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
they really do take care of girls.

491
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:23,230
They've got like an apartment
in New York that she lives in.

492
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,760
She gets a check every month.

493
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,740
I mean figure it costs them 50 grand a
year and these are guys that have fucking

494
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,150
$30 million.

495
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,960
So to have a relationship set up when
when they come to town they don't have to

496
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,230
call an escort service and they don't
have to go out and try to make a straight

497
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,011
relationship with,

498
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,930
they have to send flowers
and call every day.

499
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,890
They come to town,

500
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,720
she's fucking gorgeous.

501
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,530
P You know,

502
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,363
powerful,

503
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,293
confident.

504
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,780
It's all on the table and they've
got like three city set up and it's,

505
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,530
and when,

506
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,790
when he comes to town,

507
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
she is a available 24 seven
whatever the fuck he wants.

508
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,100
And I bet they have some kind
of friendship underneath at all.

509
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,020
Maybe not.

510
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,201
Well,

511
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,870
that would be great if it
all worked out like that,

512
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,560
right?

513
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:05,810
If,

514
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,100
if,

515
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,710
if that was the arrangement and
it all worked out like that.

516
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,130
Right?

517
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,130
But the problem with people is there's no,

518
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,700
there's never really a static state
maintains itself for any long periods of

519
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,200
time when it comes to relationships.

520
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,150
You're either kind of all in or you had
drift in and out of each other or she

521
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,470
finds another guy.

522
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,070
I mean,

523
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,030
people were weird.

524
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:25,421
They did.

525
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:26,620
It's very difficult to make.

526
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:30,880
So how are you going to maintain
the longterm prostitutional
relationships right

527
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,090
here?

528
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,000
Not most likely people that begin with,

529
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,541
yeah,

530
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,540
most likely mean you're painted
out to be awesome and beautiful.

531
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,480
But the reality is that's
not what the girl wants.

532
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,060
She wants to find a guy either if she
wants someone to take care of her,

533
00:15:43,061 --> 00:15:47,020
she wants to find a guide to take care
of her and her lover and her boyfriend or

534
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:47,920
her husband or whatever.

535
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,690
And for this guy that thinks that
he's going to like maintain it,

536
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,870
you're going to have to manage
each one of these situations.

537
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,460
If you're some crazy CEO
of some giant corporation,

538
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,080
you got like four apartments scattered
out across the country with checks living

539
00:15:59,081 --> 00:15:59,490
in them.

540
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,770
You've got to maintain these positions
like who's who's fucking her when you're

541
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:03,221
not there,

542
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,020
what's happening is anybody
planning your death,

543
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,490
you better be sure you know,

544
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:06,611
do,

545
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:07,301
what did you sign?

546
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:08,380
You sign anything crazy.

547
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:08,961
You know that.

548
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,420
Does she have any
photographs of your Dick?

549
00:16:10,421 --> 00:16:11,920
Like we'd get for a credit card?

550
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,810
Did you give her a credit card?

551
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,230
Well,

552
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,270
it's like you do,

553
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,320
you'd have to monitor these situations.

554
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,590
This ain't going to be a normal person.

555
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:20,740
It's going to be a person's willing
to fuck you because you pay for them.

556
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,340
Right.

557
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,120
And you know,

558
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,020
they might be crazy.

559
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,470
Yeah,

560
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,640
easily might be crazy.

561
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,590
I heard this dude,

562
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:30,030
I was at the w and a sitting in the lobby
waiting and this is dude sitting next

563
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,110
to me and he's got an accent,

564
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,240
sound Scandinavian and he's going,

565
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,280
uh Oh fuck I get you on the phone.

566
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,080
You've been so hard to reach lady baby.

567
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:37,381
Uh,

568
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:37,771
you know,

569
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:38,551
you know I,

570
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:38,771
I,

571
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,950
I'm so crazy but you're so beautiful.

572
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:42,140
I can't wait to get you out.

573
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,010
You need to stop going to college.

574
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:44,580
You come in,

575
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,480
I take care of,

576
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,970
he never met her and he
was talking on the phone,

577
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:51,450
clearly met on some kind
of high end dating service
where you get women that you

578
00:16:51,451 --> 00:16:55,440
take care of that she was flirting back
and they were making plans for her to

579
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:56,610
fly out for a week.

580
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,070
He was going to take her to
the best restaurants in La,

581
00:16:59,250 --> 00:16:59,760
blah blah.

582
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,950
And I was telling her all the
things he's going to bribe her with.

583
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,341
Right.

584
00:17:02,341 --> 00:17:04,410
And he had seen pictures online.

585
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:07,830
They had talked on the phone clearly
a few times and he was closing.

586
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,810
He was making the
arrangements to fly her out.

587
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,051
Okay.

588
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,100
Why do we have a problem with that?

589
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,830
Why does anybody have a
problem with should been right?

590
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,930
One's eyes are open.

591
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:16,590
I don't think,

592
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,010
I think all prostitution
should be legalized.

593
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:22,020
I think that whorehouses
should be legalized.

594
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,780
I think that having having horizontal
street or having to go through Craig's

595
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:26,700
list is,

596
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,140
it's horrible.

597
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:30,180
The reality is people
are going to use Horace,

598
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,590
put it on the table,

599
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,424
legalize it,

600
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,760
make them get tested for STDs,

601
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,200
make sure they're keeping their money.

602
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:40,080
They're not getting
fucking beaten up and uh,

603
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,030
and relationships like
this should be fine.

604
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,410
Yeah.

605
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,640
Well unbelievably

606
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,750
fascinating that you have something that
everybody wants and everybody gets for

607
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:48,380
free.

608
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,950
But as soon as you money to it,

609
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,850
it has this massive stigma to it.

610
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,860
Like,

611
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,191
you know,

612
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:56,280
saying that these prostitution
and relationships aren't stable,

613
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,890
what relationships are,

614
00:17:59,250 --> 00:17:59,491
you know,

615
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:00,324
are you,

616
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,111
you hook up with someone,

617
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:04,440
is that going to be stable if you just
meet people randomly and have sex with

618
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:04,501
him?

619
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,520
He agreed to have sex with each other.

620
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,301
Is that going to be stable?

621
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,190
You sure it might not be stable either.

622
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,350
You might run into instability
everywhere you turn,

623
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,090
but the main reason why we,

624
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,350
how all these negativity,

625
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,700
negative ideas attached to the idea of
prostitution is because it's illegal.

626
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,670
What if you hookup one
night with a cheque?

627
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,930
You bought dinner,

628
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,190
you bought drinks,

629
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,150
you paid for the cab,

630
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:24,050
back to the apartment,

631
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,340
you spent all the money.

632
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,630
You guys fuck.

633
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,300
How is that different than how
handing the girl money and having sex?

634
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:29,740
So there,

635
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,380
how about all those things are just you
dating and there's nothing wrong with

636
00:18:32,381 --> 00:18:35,590
being nice and being nice to someone
and taking a friend out or drive in them

637
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,090
around taking them to a nice restaurant.

638
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:37,924
Nothing wrong with that.

639
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,310
But then what does she says,

640
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,570
I've got this situation,

641
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,793
um,

642
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,850
I'm three months Martin and my rent
and I don't know what's doing you like,

643
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,011
look,

644
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:45,940
I'll just take care of it.

645
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,040
And you write her a check and
then she sucked your Dick.

646
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,240
What happened there?

647
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:49,720
Right?

648
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,500
What happened there?

649
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,640
Did you pay for her to Suck Your Dick?

650
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:52,300
We don't know.

651
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,110
She might've stopped you dick.

652
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,560
Anyway,

653
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,490
you might've been like,

654
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:55,240
listen baby,

655
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,350
you know you don't get money from me,

656
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,590
but you do get Dick and you pull
your dick out and then she blows you.

657
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,220
That's different.

658
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,610
Right.

659
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,840
But most guys can't pull that off.

660
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,703
What about,

661
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,750
what about a marriage where the wife
does that work has never earned a dime.

662
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,130
She's having sex with you.

663
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,150
[inaudible] that's prostitution according
to some people according to some

664
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:13,391
people.

665
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:14,051
It's certainly is.

666
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,110
I mean according to a lot of male
feminists who would be right,

667
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,800
right?

668
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,250
Yeah.

669
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:18,880
I mean it's,

670
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,280
it's money coming in sex going out.

671
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,620
I mean if that's what you want to look at,

672
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,360
but it's agreements.

673
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,070
It's the problem is the idea of money.

674
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,840
It's agreements you,

675
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,570
that's where the idea
of prostitution sort of,

676
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,930
it comes down to what it comes down to
is are people having sex with people that

677
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:38,680
they might not necessarily have
been willing to without any benefit,

678
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,960
but that benefit exists so
they are willing to do it.

679
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,370
Is that prostitution?

680
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,241
Because if it,

681
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,770
if that benefit is only money,

682
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,130
then the,

683
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:46,590
you're,

684
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,140
you're defining sex for
something as sex for money,

685
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,130
that's prostitution.

686
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,570
But everything is sex for something.

687
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:52,690
Yeah.

688
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,230
If you see,

689
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,300
like you were talking about
the Ferrari thing before,

690
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,400
if you're at a club and a,

691
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,660
you see a guy pull up in a Ferrari
and you go home with that guy.

692
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,410
Part of the reason you went home
with him is you saw the Ferrari.

693
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:07,330
There's not dollars exchanged,

694
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,510
but there is an implicit understanding
this dude's got money and he spends it

695
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,290
like a fucking lunatic.

696
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,590
Yup,

697
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,940
and you want to be around that.

698
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,310
That's a good point that he
spends it like a fucking lunatic.

699
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,500
That's a great point because
that's really what it is.

700
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:21,600
A guy who's so flashy,

701
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,560
he's driving a $250,000 car.

702
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,080
He's not going to hesitate to give
you a couple of grand here and there,

703
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,440
right.

704
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:26,830
You know,

705
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,880
you want to buy a new pair of shoes.

706
00:20:27,881 --> 00:20:28,211
He's like,

707
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:28,590
here,

708
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,280
I don't fucking peels off some hundreds,

709
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:30,860
right.

710
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,190
Gives you a kiss on the cheek
and goes back to doing business.

711
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:33,641
Buy,

712
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:34,160
sell,

713
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,540
buy,

714
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,840
sell the fucking some crazy.

715
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,481
Right?

716
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:40,930
Multimillionaire Maniac
banker dude's right.

717
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,850
It's a party and you just got invited.

718
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,330
You're going to be around this fucking,

719
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,010
this guy who doesn't give a about money.

720
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,850
He knows he's gonna die soon because he's
on Adderall and he's chained smoke and

721
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,684
he's a drunk,

722
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,890
and wherever you go,

723
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,240
you're eating the best steaks.

724
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:56,500
You're getting into the best clubs.

725
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,610
Life is fucking good.

726
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,470
Oh yeah.

727
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,220
Oh yeah.

728
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,030
And I'm fucking him.

729
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,800
Yeah,

730
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,080
yeah,

731
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,370
yeah.

732
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:01,891
There's that.

733
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:04,230
At the end of that Ivan's wife and every,

734
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:05,400
when you show up the country club,

735
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,870
oh miss nick 11 Prius.

736
00:21:06,871 --> 00:21:09,660
Come on in and you've got a
little poodle with you and you,

737
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,400
you fucking walking your $3,000 shoes
and he waddled in there and take your

738
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,001
tennis lesson,

739
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:15,780
your tennis player,

740
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,471
fucking bones,

741
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,304
you in the locker room.

742
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,090
Then the husband says,

743
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,930
bring him over.

744
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,860
I want to watch.

745
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,801
Oh Jesus,

746
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,634
I ain't got so ugly.

747
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,633
A lot of guys won't do that,

748
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,440
but I don't think that's a normal thing.

749
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:26,800
No,

750
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,050
I don't think that's
watching a lot of the watch.

751
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,741
That's a weird thing.

752
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:30,940
And then the cock hold porn,

753
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,650
just Latino cuckold porn.

754
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,331
Where do you find that?

755
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:36,850
I haven't really seen
once typing cuckold porn.

756
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:37,361
Don't do it,

757
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:37,631
Brian,

758
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:38,464
Huh?

759
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:47,960
Okay.
