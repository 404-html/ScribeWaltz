1
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,570
Good experience,

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,460
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,593
All Day

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,280
you gotta be in shape.

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,350
How many guys can you shoot with?

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,563
Right.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,220
Those are tough to.

8
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:35,820
I've seen.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,520
I've seen really big guy is not going
to pull just because it's an awkward and

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:40,760
yeah,

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,640
it's a different deal

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,240
that feel that you're used to that.

13
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:54,074
That's fine.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,003
Cool.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,790
I like this because you can really
get a good grip to all four fingers as

16
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,550
opposed to like the thing wrapped around.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,120
I'd have to see because normally you
don't want to grip it [inaudible] like I,

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,060
I don't grip it at all because
when you're gripping it,

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,340
that's one more thing to like.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,520
I mean if I'm gripping this,

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,060
that's,

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,400
you can have pork on there and it's gonna.

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,520
It's gonna to pull it,

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,271
to pull it.

25
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,104
Right.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,943
But I wonder,

27
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,240
are you still gripping when
you're just relaxing to.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,030
Yeah,

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,240
he's,

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,661
as you know,

31
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,670
you want to be as relaxed as possible.

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,273
Yeah.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,060
Don't come up to just put it here.

34
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,180
I don't know.

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,960
I just feel like with this second round,

36
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,803
give it good.

37
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,531
Well yeah,

38
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,364
and you're used to it.

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,910
It was nice to be here.

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,133
That's fine.

41
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,743
Cool.

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,530
So did you get a factor
over a spider in this way?

43
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:28,930
Because they don't make a spider at 90
pounds with that carbon and with the it's

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,210
long.

45
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,170
It's long.

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,850
So this is 30 inches and it's aluminum.

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,393
They,

48
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,360
they just didn't want to do a 90 pounder
and that they thought there might be or

49
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,230
they never said why,

50
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,070
but probably the engineer just sat there
might be too much riser torquing or

51
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,180
whatever that much pounded show.

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,590
They don't even give
me that one for people.

53
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,990
No,

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,823
no,

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,903
no,

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,350
no.

57
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,190
This is why.

58
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,083
And everybody's,

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,010
Oh you don't need to shoot 90 pounds
in the bows bowser so efficient.

60
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:03,843
I'm like,

61
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,620
as much as I want.

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,513
And

63
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,200
I'm like,

64
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,050
it's 300 horsepower.

65
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,720
Good within $600 product.

66
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,810
That's my monkey mindset.

67
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,003
Yeah.

68
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,043
Anyway,

69
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,311
I just think,

70
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,551
you know,

71
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,384
if you're going to

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,510
shouldn't have had the chance to kill you,

73
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,403
you know,

74
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,990
you go into the woods with like glocks
and like a fucking Samurai sword or some

75
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,820
shit,

76
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,730
like five miles away and then you
shoot it and then you set it up.

77
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,390
So it's like big and scary when in reality
it was like drinking water and taking

78
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:48,391
a shit but at the same dust as a pig
from to home ranch fence up here guys,

79
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,100
we were upstanding.

80
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:53,280
I'll share with shot for the
teeth on that motherfucker.

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,310
These things are tough
to when you eat them

82
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,350
game.

83
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,990
This I shot,

84
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,990
this one says to home ranch and so like
a hour and half of it's a big fucking

85
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,903
swamp.

86
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,990
It looks like that thing

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,490
like or recommend your tongue.

88
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,720
It's not gaining.

89
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,630
It tastes good but they're all muscle
the muscle and you have to marry the shit

90
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:20,440
out of me.

91
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,730
Like the Loin pork,

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,331
pork loin.

93
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,500
It's like the softest.

94
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,370
Most tend to have a regular pick.

95
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,870
But I'm like a wild pigs.

96
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:32,260
I eat a bodybuilder because like
my kids were like why is this shit?

97
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,360
So Chili

98
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,210
is everywhere.

99
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,280
It's fighting over a mate which playing
other people for like pissing territory.

100
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,030
Yeah,

101
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,930
it's pretty crazy.

102
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,250
And they have so many of them.

103
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,520
This one branch is 50,000 pigs,

104
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,310
$50,000 and they have
at least 16 outlines,

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,580
maybe 20 mountain lions.

106
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,170
They don't even know how many they have,

107
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,840
but they've got like a bunch
of pictures from this one,

108
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,640
the pond where the animals come to drink
and they have like a bunch of different

109
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,180
model lines.

110
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,910
I could at least 16 of them that I
take pictures with this camera trap.

111
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
They have their

112
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,590
50,000 pigs.

113
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,910
Twenty minute live me.

114
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,960
That is fucking.

115
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,100
That's crazy.

116
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,300
Wild Africa shit.

117
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,040
Pigs will kill you to
pluck you out of the.

118
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:21,940
Well the big ones will,

119
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,920
they'll cut you up for sure.

120
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,810
You know even if you get away
those tasks is very dangerous,

121
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,640
but people certainly not from Pitt.

122
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,140
I saw when I saw this,

123
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,210
this was like a water buffalo and it's
baby was getting eaten by like two lions,

124
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,390
jumbos baby and distinct.

125
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,970
Just put his head down and they have
like this specific trip where they put

126
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,510
their horn almost as if
it's rubbing the ground.

127
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:49,060
Like you can't get low enough to the.

128
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,450
He was rubbing the foreign across the
ground and as soon as he felt it near the

129
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:52,990
cat,

130
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,830
he just pulled it up and I'll fucking
full grown bitch line flew in the air.

131
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,980
Is that a fucking water was cut from the.

132
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,120
He'll do almost a had a hole in here.

133
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,170
But when you saw it,

134
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,410
he had cooked the skin itself
here because the skin is so tight,

135
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,560
the skin and this should
just flew in the air.

136
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,830
So you fully flew by
skin ripping documentary.

137
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,140
Relentless enemy get.

138
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,003
Yes,

139
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,790
I've watched it.

140
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,700
I've watched it like completely
for like two months straight.

141
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,540
Then it's like,

142
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,603
it's the uh,

143
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,090
the water buffalo and alliance ships
just trapped on an island by himself,

144
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:29,230
you know,

145
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,280
and the only thing they could
do was fucking bang out.

146
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,950
It gets to the point where I was
at a point where they're just like,

147
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:34,784
fuck it.

148
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,210
It's part of the thing like we know you're
going to get one of us and shit like

149
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:38,391
that.

150
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,021
So letting you know,

151
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:39,854
it's just gonna happen.

152
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,150
It was a home.

153
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,930
So I kinda like la gangs in the nineties.

154
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,310
It's way crazy.

155
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,410
Like father knows best and then right
after I will slip don't ad is when the

156
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,550
footage came out of the,

157
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:52,851
um,

158
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,530
the alligators in the same situation.

159
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:55,280
What was that called again?

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,800
Oh yes.

161
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,930
It's the triangulation.

162
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
What was the alligators?

163
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,160
Alligators fighting over to
delegate or water buffalo shit.

164
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:03,940
The lion was cracking down

165
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,280
and they were all trying to get like a.

166
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,910
An animal.

167
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,190
Yeah.

168
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,430
Yeah.

169
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,680
They're like fighting over the issue that
I see that I love to watch his killer

170
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,370
whales when they unison
what's illustrated.

171
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,740
That DNA is mostly related
to peck animals like wolves.

172
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,140
They're smart as fuck,

173
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,680
man.

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,110
Those things come after
the election is this.

175
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,100
They showed them keeping a
seal alive for like five,

176
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,510
six hours and what they say,

177
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:33,110
what sort of blue moon after they're
done biting it and flipping it in the air

178
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,340
and giving it to the baby,

179
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,480
they'll let one go.

180
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,340
Like once in a blue moon when I had to,

181
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,320
I don't know how to fucking traumatized
that type of must be traumatized,

182
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:45,920
but every single one of them
gets thrown into fucking air.

183
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:50,300
Flipped around for like four or five hours
to show the baby how to do it because

184
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:55,301
they always have like four big like adults
and then they always have like a baby

185
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:59,450
with them to teach and the baby does
Elisha to you think that he's not working

186
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,550
to working.

187
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,630
You can see them pop up like that.

188
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,330
Just to remind the seal.

189
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,730
You don't come this way too.

190
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,910
Did you ever see the one where
they had them on the Ice Shelf?

191
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,744
They had to

192
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,900
weigh in on one side and making them
slide towards them and they were teaching

193
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:16,480
the baby how to do it.

194
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,990
It was fine and as soon
as he fell in the water,

195
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:21,260
that was probably night night done.

196
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,080
Shut down the city for Nico to smart man.

197
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,240
Keeping them in the cage,

198
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,710
keeping them in a fish tank like that.

199
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:30,180
It's just wait for it to us that slavery

200
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,623
slavery,

201
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,550
just because they don't
understand what they're saying.

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,280
We pretended not just
like almost like people.

203
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:37,731
I know.

204
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:41,420
Some dumb fucking people that I would
think like a dolphin will probably smarter

205
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,910
than really fucking dumb.

206
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:46,180
Killer went up probably a lot of them.

207
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,570
They're really smart man.

208
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:50,360
We just don't think of them as smart
because we don't see them altering their

209
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,440
environment like we do,

210
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,210
but if you pay attention
to everything else,

211
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,140
language,

212
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,973
family,

213
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,420
they have with good companions for life.

214
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,130
They stick together with these parts.

215
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,500
They have different dialects
in different regions.

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,210
Might as well be people,

217
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:03,690
man,

218
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,140
we're just.

219
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,630
We're just saying they're not people
because they don't change their

220
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,350
environment,

221
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,700
but their smartest fucking people.

222
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,110
Man.

223
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,600
They're just.

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,920
They're living in a different world,

225
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,050
but they don't wear nothing new.

226
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,350
They don't wear anything.

227
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,270
They don't know.

228
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,540
They don't build houses.

229
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,950
They already got some flossing on

230
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,090
a rolled up.

231
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,990
Rocking some shit though.

232
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:23,490
You'd think so different about them.

233
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,803
There were closed.

234
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,780
We were except Tuxedo.

235
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,910
Everyday though took seed.

236
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,070
I can wait to see what we're so goofy
if they were wearing the shit that they

237
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,040
killed it,

238
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,400
like,

239
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,233
oh

240
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,210
well that has a giant horn on.

241
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,900
We came out with that.

242
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:46,734
Is this cane

243
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,053
like

244
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,423
Unicorns?

245
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,913
There's just.

246
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,100
Sometimes they have one.

247
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,550
There's one that has to,

248
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,551
which is crazy.

249
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,551
Which is why they were mistaken for like
seeing animals and in Scandinavia they

250
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:09,540
used to sell the horn as like a fake
unicorn bar and there were all kinds of

251
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:09,820
shit.

252
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,430
Then it makes perfect
sense when you look at.

253
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,610
Imagine what was in the
water 10,000 years ago.

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,900
People didn't even know.

255
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,540
They had no idea what was out there.

256
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,541
Like now we've only studied 90 percent
of your social back then what they one,

257
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,760
one percent and I didn't know then

258
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,840
they had no idea what was in there and
you could go out there for fucking days

259
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,290
and days.

260
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:34,711
Never see.

261
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,221
Sure.

262
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:37,500
And then there's things live
underneath you the whole time.

263
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,900
Fuck fuck man.

264
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:40,440
That's,

265
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,840
that's the trippy shit of all time that
people were willing to get that crazy a

266
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,673
few thousand years ago.

267
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,290
Nope.

268
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,030
No documentaries to watch,

269
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,010
you know,

270
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,130
know Jacques Cousteau,

271
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,900
but they just found that no company.

272
00:10:53,901 --> 00:10:55,290
So giant squishy too.

273
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,140
Did you hear about that
dude that just survived?

274
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:02,600
He was out at sea for over a year and
his partner ended up passing away,

275
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:02,731
right?

276
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,001
He was like,

277
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:03,360
yeah,

278
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,230
she bought her some shit and family.

279
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,370
He's getting mad and he floated from
like the Pacific coast of California.

280
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,620
He floated to like some feet,

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
pretty much pronounced him dead
because he was gone for a year.

282
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,720
The rainwater and turtle blood,

283
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,123
whatever.

284
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,310
Stay alive for over a year to 18 months.

285
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:24,144
I was crushed.

286
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,670
I don't know,

287
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,503
it was floating.

288
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,890
He was in a bowl.

289
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:28,040
Him,

290
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,930
his boys were fishing on the boat and
he's basically the only one to survive.

291
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,560
Those are the.

292
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,980
I ran out here the date and using
shit pregnant two weeks ago.

293
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,853
Right.

294
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,840
I mean that it was out there a year.

295
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,843
Let's get

296
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,250
kettle bells.

297
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,570
You know,

298
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,250
this one is 50 pounds.

299
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,810
Fifty five pounds.

300
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,760
We have ones of 45 pounds,

301
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:52,700
70 pounds because tomorrow's
a early dude could see she's,

302
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,560
she's really cool.

303
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,101
She's awesome.

304
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:55,000
Actually follow her.

305
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,863
She's a great artist.

306
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:56,703
Oh cool.

307
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,713
That'd be fun.

308
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,450
But um,

309
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,500
you can get a 35 pound one 70
pounds to 55 and you're good man.

310
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,431
That's all you need.

311
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,920
And you could follow like a
hundred different workouts.

312
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:06,754
Online.

313
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,710
Kettlebells are all about like using your
whole body to the end range of motion

314
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:16,390
is differently if you're sitting on a
stench how often either be on your back,

315
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,224
pushing kettle bell,

316
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,380
swinging and controlling the weight.

317
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,000
It's all about having a hold of the
weight and controlling in working out with

318
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:29,860
it and making you do like a long
reps that like translates to work.

319
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,170
Like if you were like physical work,

320
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:36,010
picking things up and moving
things or grappling or any,

321
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,030
any athletics,

322
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,410
it's your whole body working
together to control one thing.

323
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,090
Notice the whole body
working in one motion.

324
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,420
Not like doing bench
perhaps or doing curls.

325
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,260
It's whole body listening,

326
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,410
stabilizer muscles and balance everything.

327
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,951
Oh yeah.

328
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:51,790
All your core.

329
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,850
Especially shit like that.

330
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:53,684
Like windmills,

331
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,020
like anything where you're like,

332
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,950
you'll do like a whole
series of these swing Khakis.

333
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,390
I just keep going,

334
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,630
Joe got to go

335
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,660
and it just gets you tired.

336
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:08,411
Like real work.

337
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,370
They're getting me tired.

338
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,160
Watching my shoulder
would pop down already.

339
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,790
Now he's getting into great,

340
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,980
but doing shit like that
builds full body strength.

341
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,380
No,

342
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:18,480
no,

343
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,640
no.

344
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,720
You're writing core.

345
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,130
The little muscles around here,

346
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,840
little tiny translates to work.

347
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,060
It translates to like a sport.

348
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,180
Fucking crazy stuff.

349
00:13:28,181 --> 00:13:30,310
Get a couple of those
and that's all you need.

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,540
Experience trying my day job,

351
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,830
get podcasts all day.
