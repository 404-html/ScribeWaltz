1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Four,
three,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,020
two,
one.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,560
Boom.
We've done thousand.

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,060
What,
how many podcasts?

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,760
1,000.
One hundred and 16.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Steven Tyler was the only man to bring a
crystal ball here the first because you 

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,520
got to bring it with you when you come.
Do you bring that everywhere?

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,670
Yeah,
I'll bring it with me to Maui.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,250
I'll bring it with me to,
to uh,

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,370
Europe.
Yeah.

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,490
What is it?
It's just I'm into Chrysalis are just,

12
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,650
it's ready.
It's got a beautiful occlusion and when 

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,981
you get the light just right on it.
Just like me on stage at night when the 

14
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:39,981
night is jess,
right?

15
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:41,550
You know what I'm saying?
Dude,

16
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,551
you look fucking fantastic for 70.
Can I just tell you I thought you were 

17
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:46,551
70.
I was like,

18
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:49,360
Holy Shit.
You look really good and it's amazing.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,250
It really does.
And I walk around like this and wonder 

20
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,370
why everybody's fucking taking pictures 
and busting my chops.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,150
Walking through the airport.
I actually have a tee shirt that says go

22
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:05,151
fuck yourself because you're walking 
with a dog and you're walking with a 

23
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:07,250
girl and they come over and want to stop
and take a Selfie song,

24
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:08,820
but thank you.
Thank you for that.

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,830
Is that what it is?
Well,

26
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:15,831
I don't know.
I spent 30 years of it on drugs and 

27
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:16,530
drunk.
So maybe the crystal helped you?

28
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,900
I think so.
I say something.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,020
Yeah.
How long have you been carrying that 

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,020
thing around?
I don't.

31
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:24,240
It's it lives in my house.
I have one.

32
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,330
I do keep in my pocket.
We do is not here today.

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,970
Oh,
what is that?

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,660
He preached Switchblade,
Jesus Christ.

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,100
Joe Perry and I got a thing,
you know,

36
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:38,190
we switched places.
We just collect knives,

37
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:38,690
man.
We're just.

38
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,320
Well,
you know,

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,900
I'm such a country boy.
And when I did idol every night when I 

40
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,330
walked out on stage and went to bed a 
bit,

41
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,410
a bit,
a bit a bit it.

42
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,980
And I'm walking next to j Lo and randy,
my knife was right in my pocket in case 

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,480
someone just one thing.
No opening my fan mail.

44
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,350
Oh,
okay.

45
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.
Switch plate to open fan.

46
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,030
It's fun.
It's a cool thing.

47
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,590
Is Fun.
You don't often carry it,

48
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:06,591
but I,
I thought because I think you're so 

49
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:07,260
fucking cool that I would bring a couple
of cool things from my house,

50
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,070
you know,
I'm just like that.

51
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,850
Oh,
thank you.

52
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,650
I'm one of those guys that want to leave
the house I go to.

53
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,850
I said goodbye house number.
I got a son and three daughters.

54
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,570
Right.
So.

55
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,350
And I know after watching.
What was the,

56
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,480
what was your last triggered that you 
got a bunch of kids too and it starts 

57
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:26,400
wearing off on you.
I think it's a beautiful thing.

58
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,910
I think it's a beautiful thing to his 
wife and two girls.

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,620
I have three girls.
Three daughters.

60
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,050
It will happen to you.
I do too.

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
Oh yeah.
You're a legit eccentric.

62
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,340
Like there's some people that pretend to
be eccentric.

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,820
Heel like a legit one.
I am and I love it.

64
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,470
In fact,
I love me.

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,050
It's good to love more than that.
I love us.

66
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,090
I love us too.
I love us.

67
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,480
I say that all super happy about this.
I'm so fucking excited.

68
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,950
Seriously,
I've got to ask you,

69
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,280
what the fuck do you eat for breakfast?
Um,

70
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,070
how did you get so fucking smart?
Oh,

71
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm not that smart.
I just remember things.

72
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,620
Okay.
Because that's the difference.

73
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,990
There's a difference between being smart
and just remembering a lot.

74
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm sure you remember.
Yeah.

75
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,530
I'm not that smart.
Well,

76
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:10,830
remembering things is huge.
It helps.

77
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,980
Certainly helps.
Yeah.

78
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,080
But what is smart,
right?

79
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,000
Smart is like,
can you solve equations?

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
Can you figure things out that other 
people can't figure out?

81
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,960
You know,
things other people don't know.

82
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,320
No,
I just remember shit that smart people 

83
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,600
have already figured out.
But you accumulate situations.

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,770
It was like Jimi Hendrix experience 
experiential.

85
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:31,840
So if you remember those things over and
over,

86
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,180
you're going to become a wizard.
You're with.

87
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,740
You're so good.
Thank you.

88
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,970
That's,
that's why I watched your show and I 

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,500
watched the beginning right before you 
walked out on stage.

90
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,530
The triggered.
And I'd say two things that came to my 

91
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,960
attention was one,
you were talking with your producer,

92
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,040
whoever they said there's your chair.
And by the way,

93
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,290
you bottled waters right there.
We need those guys.

94
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,220
Right?
Oh,

95
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:59,221
for sure.
And the other thing is you were sitting 

96
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,340
on the couch alone reading your notes.
Yeah.

97
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Yeah.
And you show that it's a beautiful 

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:05,520
thing.
I can't live without my notes.

99
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,190
I can't.
I fly at such a speed,

100
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,820
such an altitude that I can't remember 
what I did yesterday,

101
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,800
but then I have longterm where I go.
Yeah,

102
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,801
that was a three months ago.
But I just thought I would read you a 

103
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:23,950
timeline because I saw you reading your 
notes April 15th,

104
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,470
lunch with the kids in Venice.
My daughter lives in Venice.

105
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,440
Hi Chelsea.
That's a long time ago.

106
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,600
Drove to San Diego,
you know,

107
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,500
a month because I don't have good 
memory.

108
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,990
Alright.
Drove to San Diego that night.

109
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,991
So you write things down like after you 
did them just to solidify them in your 

110
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:39,991
head?
No,

111
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,490
I just came from a whirlwind of press 
and Steven Tyler Day and released a 

112
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:49,621
documentary.
The kct did and all this shit happened 

113
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:53,461
and we played the jazz fest in New 
Orleans and that happened in the last 

114
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,760
two weeks and I just said to amy,
what have,

115
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,210
what have we been doing in the last?

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
Where have we been?
Right.

117
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,400
So I wrote it down,
drove to San Diego after Venice did a 

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,610
private show,
flew to Orlando that night.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,900
Right.
Okay.

120
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,870
Private Gig with David Foster,
Katy Perry,

121
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:16,000
peer from idle.
This girl was so sweet.

122
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,760
I'm rehearse with the band.
Uh,

123
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,530
and during the break from the band,
I was in Disney world.

124
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:28,531
I rode,
I rode my rollercoaster and I just got 

125
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:28,600
back from Disney world and I wrote your 
rollercoaster yesterday so you know,

126
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,910
you've made it when I see the day before
yesterday.

127
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,320
So I'm going through this list and I 
went,

128
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,340
wait a minute,
we want.

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,050
And it was just a,
you know,

130
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:38,500
so rode the roller coaster that I had 
overdosed her.

131
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,570
That rock and roller coaster.
He's great.

132
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,630
Right?
Two Times it goes up like the ankles 

133
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:45,630
backwards.
Yeah.

134
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,800
Zero to 60 in two point eight seconds.
Pretty Dope.

135
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,030
Yeah.
Sick electromagnetic propulsion dude.

136
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,920
Dude,
what are we doing here?

137
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,980
What are we doing here?
So then I went over to the animal 

138
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:58,980
kingdom and to visit some of my old 
girlfriends.

139
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,920
No,
I went through the Avatar ride.

140
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,610
I had to.
Shit I fucking shit.

141
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,730
Is that Avatar ride intense?
The one when you get on the bike,

142
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,370
you're flying on the dragon virtual 
reality.

143
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,230
That's the greatest ride of all time.
The greatest,

144
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,440
I think it's called flights of passage.
It was what's called,

145
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,160
it might be not.
Avi I've taken.

146
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,210
I just got,
I went to,

147
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,300
just to break here for a second.
I went to Betty Ford eight years ago 

148
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,800
because I got fucked up with my foot 
stuff and just stuff with your foot 

149
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:29,800
stuff.
Uh,

150
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,140
I had an operation on my foot,
you know,

151
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,620
and I kept the meds right by the bed,
you know what I'm saying?

152
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,580
What'd you get done with my girlfriends?

153
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,120
So they were right there and I thought 
five minutes ago when a ticket,

154
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,130
another one.
That's what happens to a lot of people 

155
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,700
with those pain pills.
So I checked myself into bay for it,

156
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:47,960
but while I was there,
they let me out a couple times.

157
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:53,350
I saw Avatar eight times.
Did you get avatar depression now know 

158
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,660
what that is?
No,

159
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,710
no.
I became her,

160
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,990
right?
Oh No.

161
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,120
Not to leave weaver character.
The other one,

162
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,830
right?
Yeah.

163
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,960
The girl and I'm not.
The guy became her and I just watched 

164
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,410
her moves and he's pretty dope.
I cannot wait for that to come out.

165
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,450
Yeah,
it's going to come out soon.

166
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,360
Okay.
Then we'll be back in a.

167
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,490
We flew right to New York City after the
show went to see Bruce springsteen's one

168
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:17,390
off.
I'm probably that night.

169
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,860
How was that?
Sick.

170
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,570
Sick.
He's so good now.

171
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,690
I got to tell you,
I'm not the biggest bruce springsteen 

172
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:26,690
fan,
but um,

173
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,530
I respect him.

174
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,130
I love his music.
I know we became a phenomenon like 72,

175
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:36,131
like when we did and sitting there and 
watching him be honest and talk to this 

176
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,910
crowd and sing songs and play the piano 
and talk as truth.

177
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,870
And then he said something like,
um,

178
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,480
he goes,
you know,

179
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:47,110
there's New Jersey thing with a pregnant
pause,

180
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,140
pregnant pause.
He goes,

181
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,140
I invented that.
And that was it.

182
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,050
He warmed my heart because when someone 
says that it was so real and so true.

183
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,060
But Sinatra was from hoboken.
Yeah.

184
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,910
And I'm from yonkers.
Okay.

185
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,100
Or the Bronx,
one of the Bronx.

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,450
I was born in New Jersey to new NORC.
Wow.

187
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,180
Fascinating Newark,
New Jersey Trivia.

188
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,130
And right where you were born and they 
put an airport.

189
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,200
I think it was already there.

190
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,690
So you lived in the higher end 
neighborhood?

191
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,420
Not really.
Okay.

192
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:31,421
So that night flew,
flew right to New York City after the 

193
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:31,730
show went to see Bruce springsteen.
And I said that redundancy.

194
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,170
And you loved it?
I loved it.

195
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,040
I loved it.
Um,

196
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,610
um,
then I did the next morning,

197
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:42,611
woke up,
did Harper's bazaar shoot for the cover 

198
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,630
with my daughter live,
Keith Richards,

199
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:45,890
daughters were there,
all that stuff.

200
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,520
After I hung out with Lenny Kravitz,
had a nice couple of slices with lenny.

201
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,210
My Bro flew to muscle shoals right after
that and recorded the song with Nuno 

202
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,310
Betancourt.
Sick as fuck.

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,460
So good.
So good.

204
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,440
That was.
That was three days of this.

205
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,320
This is a hell of a timeline you got 
going on here.

206
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,970
Yeah,
the and that was the next day.

207
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,770
I went right to recalls place who passed
away like three months ago and his son,

208
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,370
Rodney Hall works the place.
It's called fame studios and and I sat 

209
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:22,011
in a room.
He took me all over the place and I 

210
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:23,730
walked in to like the demo room where 
you could smell the oxides off the tape.

211
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,960
Wow.
We'd like Percy sledge demo.

212
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,060
Wait,

213
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,780
know that first shit,
the first stuff or Wilson picket and I'm

214
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,350
sitting in the room with him and I'm 
telling you,

215
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:40,220
man,
I started to cry.

216
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,810
I cried.
I welled up three times.

217
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,450
Wow.
Just to be in the room.

218
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,050
I'm standing doing the vocals to brown 
sugar.

219
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Right?
We're a little Richard's right where he 

220
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,471
sang.
I see a picture on the wall of him 

221
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:56,780
standing right there.
He's all in muscle shoals muscle shows.

222
00:09:56,781 --> 00:09:58,370
Did you see that documentary?
I did.

223
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,990
I watched the documentary,
first of all,

224
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,830
I said,
I'm in.

225
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,620
What is it about that place?
How did that place?

226
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
Here's what it is.
It's the vibes.

227
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,410
If you're into vibes,
yeah,

228
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,740
if you're into living,
if you're into fueling live,

229
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:12,560
you can always feel sad when your mom 
dies,

230
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,100
but you got to amp that up.
You've got to feel good when bad things 

231
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,550
are going now you've got to thank God 
when bad things are going.

232
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Are you going to be into crystals?
Love you,

233
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,160
love your girlfriend.
Try to be happy to.

234
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:29,161
I find the positivity and negativity,
and then when you're listening to music 

235
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,890
and your very favorite thing in your 
close your eyes,

236
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,130
that's vibes.
That's something you can't even talk 

237
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,130
about.
Really.

238
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,440
It's how you feel personally.
Whatever you've been through in your 

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,230
life,
those vibes of those songs.

240
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,180
Wilson picket,
little Richard.

241
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,730
I mean the allman brothers started 
there,

242
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,850
right?
So when you listen to the allman 

243
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:51,850
brothers,
you,

244
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,820
you're in the room were Greg said to his
brother,

245
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,010
let's do this song.
So do you think it is?

246
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:57,630
Because all those talented people 
perform there and they,

247
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,810
they're like,
let it soak into the building.

248
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,150
Is that what it is?
Because there's,

249
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,430
there's places that do have like a magic
to them.

250
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,410
I always talk about the comedy store 
like that.

251
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,020
The comedy store is a magic to it.
When you're there,

252
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:14,021
there's something about that place.
So like it feels like great things have 

253
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,480
happened that place before you feel it 
in the.

254
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,630
Would you feel it in the carpet?
It's just,

255
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,570
it's in the air.
You feel like that was muscle shoals,

256
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:25,571
is it?
Is it because all those great artists 

257
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:26,480
have performed there and like almost 
like the room has a memory of it?

258
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,320
I think so because there's some 
scientists that think that things have 

259
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,320
memories.
It's,

260
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,580
it's a weird,
impossible to prove idea.

261
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,000
Okay,
well,

262
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,620
when you die,
did you know that you,

263
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,020
that you're on the table,
you die,

264
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,750
and if the table is you're being weighed
as you die,

265
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,470
it goes down a number 27 grams.
Huh?

266
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,900
That's not real.
It's not true.

267
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,850
Now.
One of the things that people would say,

268
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,720
sure,
yeah.

269
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,430
There's no way of really measuring,
Oh man,

270
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,410
you just burst beloved.
It's just one of those.

271
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,870
Hold on.
It's one of those hippie thing.

272
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,170
It's one of those hippie things that 
people love to see.

273
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:01,300
Sure.
Pretty sure Jamie wants Google it.

274
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,180
I'm pretty sure that's the way I believe
in that.

275
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,430
I do too.
So I walked in the room and like,

276
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,460
check this out.
So if one of my favorite Hendrick 

277
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,170
Hendrix songs.
Well are you an,

278
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,670
are you experienced right?
Not necessarily stone,

279
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,040
but beautiful.
Meanwhile you walk on stage and go,

280
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,500
fuck me,
these edibles.

281
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,050
I walk in here and go,
fuck me.

282
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:26,110
I didn't do my nails.
But you use these edibles now.

283
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,390
Used to do all kinds of crazy shit.
What do you mean drugs drug wise?

284
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,330
Oh you fuck.
Yeah,

285
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,590
of course.
Well,

286
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,190
yeah.
Well,

287
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,250
when you were being born,
I was walking around New York City with 

288
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,600
John Belushi,
knocking on everybody's door to get some

289
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:40,870
blow.

290
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,540
I mean we were good friends.
We,

291
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,030
it's what you did back then.
I believed that,

292
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,030
uh,
in the spirit of music was,

293
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,660
think of it this way.
Why do you think they call blue spirits?

294
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,180
And when you listen to your favorite 
song,

295
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,460
you want to fuck your wife?
Hmm.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,570
I think that spirits in know,
wherever it takes you,

297
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,310
whatever feeling it is,
whatever.

298
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,650
When I went to muscle shoals,
I put my hand on the wood.

299
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,590
I felt the room because I knew that 
little Richard's stood right in front of

300
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:16,591
me.
All I gotta do is close my eyes and go 

301
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:16,591
back in time for a second.
If I,

302
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:19,010
you know,
I did a song with um,

303
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,610
a roots,
rock reggae,

304
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,320
play that funky music and it was a shit.
See,

305
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,810
I don't have a longterm memory.
Who did that song?

306
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:30,670
Come on.
Help me play that funky music.

307
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,810
White boy,
you know,

308
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,510
roots rock,
reggae roots,

309
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:36,150
rock reggae.
Who's up?

310
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,050
Who's the best reggae artists of all 
time?

311
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,960
Okay.
Son Calls me up and goes,

312
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,050
you got to do the song.
I go in,

313
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,060
they put in,
they put it on the two inch tape oxide,

314
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,750
the old fashioned two inch tape and I'm 
in there ready to sing.

315
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,950
Right?
And um,

316
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,320
they started rolling and I'm listening.
I got,

317
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,940
I got everything turned up and I hear 
Bob walked into the studio,

318
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,230
I hear the drummer sit down with a drum 
set and this is stool squeaks.

319
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,790
Any farts?
No,

320
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,670
but is he can hear him pick up sticks 
you here.

321
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,660
You're the bass player.
Fucking around with his base and talking

322
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:15,661
to Bob Mun.
What you fucking would you feel how 

323
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:15,661
you're feeling today,
man,

324
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:18,580
and I'm in the room with Bob Marley.
So what is spirit if that's not it,

325
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:23,140
I made them play that back again for me 
because I just closed my eyes and you're

326
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,190
in the room with Bob Martin.

327
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,260
What is certainly something right?
When you hear a song,

328
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:31,261
a great song from the past and you get 
goose bumps and just feel it inside of 

329
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:31,261
you.
Do something.

330
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,590
You get moved,
but what does it have to do with booze?

331
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,190
I think booze is called spirits because 
it puts you in that place.

332
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,630
Tony releases falsely mission and 
releases in innovation.

333
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:41,600
So,
so great truth.

334
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,550
Sarah Misner.
It is,

335
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,160
but is it false or is it just that it 
just gets abused?

336
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,230
I think it's not false.
Exactly.

337
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,660
It makes you say things you wish you did
and then you go.

338
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,280
I was lying fucking around.
Well,

339
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,080
you can be in love for a moment,
bitch.

340
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,590
You fucking fuck.
Fuck.

341
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,930
I thought you meant the Nice.
Tell me you've never done blow.

342
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,960
I've never done blow.
Ever now unfortunately drink either.

343
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,860
I drink.
Okay,

344
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,460
cool.
Yeah.

345
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,010
When I was growing up,
my friend's cousin sold blow and I saw 

346
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,010
disastrous results and I was scared off 
of it when I was very young.

347
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,720
Wow.
Good for them.

348
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,730
I had some friends that as I grew older 
and had blow problems so and I never 

349
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,670
touched it.
See,

350
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,930
you're one of them and it's your normy 
normy in some ways,

351
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,280
but I've done a lot of different things.
Like you said in that last,

352
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,490
that last documentary,
just joking.

353
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,480
You are farthest from the army.
Some people.

354
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,400
It's worth that.
You thought not to do that.

355
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,560
Yeah,
it just seems like one that I would like

356
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:44,561
too much.
It's one of the reasons why I never 

357
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:44,561
fucked with speed either.
I feel like I'd be like,

358
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,700
now I can get things done if you drink 
coffee,

359
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,700
but it's mild coffee doesn't really.
Jack is fucking mile.

360
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,520
This man is just mild.
He what is it?

361
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,660
Kim Chameleon which changes your fucking
skin into another color.

362
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,740
This is a cold brew cold brew coffee,
coffee.

363
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,200
I mean this is really.

364
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,780
Not that.
It's not coffee.

365
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:06,380
It's called Lucky Jack's nitrile cold 
brew coffee.

366
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,820
You might as well just stick this in 
your arm.

367
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,050
I don't think so.
Really.

368
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,620
I mean I don't know because I've never 
stopped anything like that.

369
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,850
My arm neither have.
I am just saying on that.

370
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,820
It's not that it's,
it's pretty strong actually.

371
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:21,620
It's probably not like what I make in 
the morning is like Kona coffee.

372
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,140
I love Kona.
Carl and I fill that fucker at the top.

373
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,170
It's so dark when you pour it,
you can't see through the stream.

374
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,390
That's when you know you're going on Joe
Rogan and going to spew some shit.

375
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,950
Some real shit.
Oh fuck him.

376
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,230
Hot Lava.
Hot Lava from Kona.

377
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,580
So then.
So we did that.

378
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:42,581
So we did.
We did branch out with me and Nuno 

379
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,460
Betancourt and we got all the players 
from way back then the horn section 

380
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,460
sections got curls to sing it.

381
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,840
It's just going to be bobby womack sat 
in that room and he did.

382
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:52,040
You know,
I used to love you,

383
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,040
but it's all over now.
So that was that day.

384
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,010
Marvin Gaye.
I'm in this room with all this tape.

385
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:01,400
So if you're a musician,
you feel the vibes.

386
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,270
If your comedic and you go to the comedy
store,

387
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,270
you feel like you're walking around and 
placenta.

388
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,730
Yeah.
There's not a recording spot for 

389
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:14,730
comedians.
You know,

390
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:14,730
you guys have a bunch of performing 
spots,

391
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,060
but you also have recording spots.
We only really have performing spots as 

392
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,330
we record in those performance buttons,
but I'm performing.

393
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,220
Yeah,
I mean I go into.

394
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,930
I just had these on last night fixing 
the lyrics and when I.

395
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,760
When you have them on,
you're listening to the track.

396
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,170
It's just,
it's something you can't explain.

397
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,820
Nobody understands that and it's akin to
tripping on acid.

398
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,870
It's akin to being drunk and sucking 
face with a girl,

399
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:48,920
making out with her.
It's akin to watching your kids be born.

400
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,120
It's an elevated experience way 
elevated,

401
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,870
and if you.
If you buy it and you push the top floor

402
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,580
like I do way past the penthouse bloom,
well I know you do it.

403
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,820
That's why I'm reading this off.
This is a day.

404
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,790
This is a a day.
This is what it was.

405
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,460
A month.
Well,

406
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,290
whatever it is,
it's also.

407
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,590
You've been doing this a long time.
This is like a life where.

408
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,270
I mean the reason why you don't have any
memory,

409
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,390
it's because you've probably filled all 
your hard drive space with crazy 

410
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,390
experiences.
Well said.

411
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You know,
I have forgotten more than most people 

412
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,000
could ever remember.
How could you not wear the.

413
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,940
How the fuck could you remember?
Everything you've ever done.

414
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,550
He'll talk to a farmer about some shit 
that happened in the fifties or old.

415
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,640
That was the day that Carol wouldn't 
give us milk.

416
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,670
They remember.
It's two things going on here.

417
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,340
I'm surrounded by people that are always
remind me.

418
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
That's good too.
You've got a good team.

419
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,750
Yeah,
and sometimes they got to be on,

420
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:44,580
like live on the tonight show.
This thing I did was with that beautiful

421
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:49,581
blonde entertainment tonight was I just 
watched it back.

422
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:54,651
I thought that's the best interview I 
think I've ever done because she looked 

423
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:55,650
me square in the eye.
She was beautiful.

424
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:59,250
She asked the right questions and it was
just perfect.

425
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,650
And you got to be on,
in those moments.

426
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,820
Yes.
That's all.

427
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,290
That's what I'm saying.
Me Too.

428
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,340
Do you,
do you miss being not sober sometimes?

429
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

430
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:12,090
I,
I,

431
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:16,970
um,
I miss a pros and cons that,

432
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,520
that if I do,
I'll wind up doing too much for sure.

433
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:20,970
For sure.

434
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,340
I can't control it.
It's just the way you are,

435
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,550
just the way I am and I don't want to.
I don't want to push it again because 

436
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,930
when I get that way,
my kids don't talk to me.

437
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,260
I get a divorce,
I'm throwing out on my own band.

438
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:34,780
Right,
right.

439
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,610
Uh,
what else?

440
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,010
I lose everything.
I mean,

441
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:42,300
it's happened enough times for me to 
finally realize,

442
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:43,320
you know what?
It's not worth it.

443
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,960
You know,
I get it.

444
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:50,961
You understand?
What I'm saying and I got a lot of 

445
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:50,961
beautiful friends.
I got a beautiful,

446
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:52,110
um,
bunch of friends,

447
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,540
um,
to keep me in line.

448
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,640
You know,
I got two sponsors,

449
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,550
one on the west coast,
one of the east coast that I call up all

450
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,350
the time ago.
I want to get so fucked up.

451
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:03,060
Right.
How does that work?

452
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,290
When you call them out,
what do they say?

453
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,460
Don't do it,
Steven.

454
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,080
No,
no,

455
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,860
fuck dude.
I do too,

456
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,690
but I keep it together.
Exactly.

457
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,910
They'll just say,
what else is new?

458
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,140
Did you guys ever talk about it that 
way?

459
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:15,030
Like fat people talk about food they 
used to eat?

460
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,250
No,
because we don't do that.

461
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,310
What was it called?
Looking back and take it into the 

462
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,310
dinosaur shit.
No do.

463
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,060
But you do.
If you go to like an AA meeting,

464
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,360
they do get up and tell awesome stories.
Oh fuck you getting fucked up.

465
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,850
Right.
See when you get sober,

466
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,970
if you don't,
if you don't continue your aftercare by 

467
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,391
going to a couple meetings every now and
then you're going to wind up using 

468
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:37,391
again.
Really,

469
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:40,950
especially someone like me who watched 
Janis Joplin up there.

470
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,490
Okay.
In 1968,

471
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,910
I'm in a high school.
She's got bangles and beads like this 

472
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,281
shit on and she's,
she's drinking southern comfort and 

473
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,060
she's spitting and using the f word,
smoking cigarettes.

474
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,990
Nobody did that back then.
She was powerful watching her and she's 

475
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,070
fucking the power in song.

476
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,780
That's why I covered that on my country 
album.

477
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

478
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,620
To this day I listen to that song like 
at least once every couple months.

479
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,760
Just put that in the headphones.
So you see us,

480
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,070
us.
What songs can do for you.

481
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,600
Well,
when you,

482
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,620
when you grew up in the sixties and what
we did was we experimented,

483
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,290
you know,
I mean if you think about what they tell

484
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:31,291
us,
Christopher Columbus discovered America 

485
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,571
know the bow of his boat was full of 
booze and he fucked Queen Elizabeth or 

486
00:21:33,571 --> 00:21:34,150
whoever.
She goes,

487
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:34,820
go,
good boy,

488
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:39,821
you know.
And she sent him on his way with some 

489
00:21:39,821 --> 00:21:40,570
money and said,
bring me back some countries you think.

490
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,360
And by the way,
he wasn't the first person here.

491
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,730
That's what America wants us to believe.
But anyway,

492
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:46,930
so,
so Christopher Columbus,

493
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,780
he's got that in his head to go to go 
check shit out.

494
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,310
Right?

495
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,080
He's drinking,
he's going by the stars at night.

496
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,700
It's kind of like that.
It's like you never took lsds have taken

497
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,360
acid.
Okay.

498
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,520
So then you know what you,
you look out.

499
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,710
We used to take acid in high school and 
we would,

500
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,940
we'd go to these.
I'm a ski slopes in the summertime,

501
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:11,941
right.
Beautiful Green Hills going up and we'd 

502
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:15,271
ride the chairlift stoned as fuck.
And we got our stuff from San Francisco,

503
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,490
from Mosley who I would call him up and 
go duty.

504
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,690
More colors,
more colors,

505
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:23,860
rate to boundless,
going to kill me.

506
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:26,230
But that's what.
So you understand that?

507
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,550
That's just,
it's like,

508
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,000
you know,
is it fucked up in its drugs?

509
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,170
Yeah.
But you're also,

510
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,710
it's like I'd love to do Iowasca.
I'd love to hear maybe my bucket list 

511
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:40,360
and that's what I'll talk to my sponsor 
about.

512
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,070
Hey,
I got this,

513
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,150
uh,
I'm in Maui.

514
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,720
Maybe I've been here too long,
but I'm over.

515
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:51,721
And Hannah that,
and I saw that you were at Rom Dawson's 

516
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:53,380
place as you were there with my friend 
Duncan trussell.

517
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,740
Hell yeah.
Yeah,

518
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,700
yeah.
Doug had sent me a picture.

519
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,120
You guys together,
do you know?

520
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,770
I went back,
they had a silent auction and I,

521
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,470
I,
you know,

522
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,950
I know Ron Doss,
he's,

523
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:07,951
you know,
he's beautiful Jewish kid from long 

524
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:07,951
island,
Long Island.

525
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,540
And he became what he did.
Talk about spirituality.

526
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,840
So I'm at the silent auction and I 
bought this and that and this and,

527
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:22,420
and one of these Mellotron type thing 
that you squeezebox she squeezed me the 

528
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:25,360
fingers and play it.
And when I left there,

529
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:29,170
guy comes over and says,
you just bought the first edition of his

530
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:32,740
book in his own handwriting.
You just bought his.

531
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:38,260
I forgot what the hell those things 
called non accordion,

532
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,350
right?
It's an accordion.

533
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:47,710
And,
and I got to listen to a two Ram das 

534
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:51,860
talk and sat right in front of him on a 
trip.

535
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:52,790
Yeah,
he's a trip.

536
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,800
I need to meet him before he leaves this
earth.

537
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,780
Yeah,
Dunkin raved about them.

538
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,490
Yep.
So what were you doing there?

539
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,550
Do you,
you obviously have an interest in 

540
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,611
psychedelic experiences,
but you are wary about attempting them 

541
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,180
at this stage after your sobriety.

542
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,720
What?
I love to trip again.

543
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,780
Yeah,
I would.

544
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,850
I would.
Do you think you could do it and you 

545
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:17,850
know,
maybe it's just like you just don't.

546
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,670
Maybe it's getting fucked up.
That's the bad thing.

547
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,700
Like just getting fucked up.
Just getting drunk and coked up and 

548
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,340
maybe that's the problem.
Maybe no,

549
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:25,770
it.
Kindness,

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,850
shamanically ceremony.
Maybe it wouldn't be a problem at all.

551
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,290
Here's the deal.
It's all one thing getting fucked up,

552
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,190
shamonic,
whatever.

553
00:24:34,191 --> 00:24:36,020
If you take in drugs and you fucked up,
you fucked up.

554
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,780
It doesn't matter if it's romantic or 
not.

555
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,350
If you,
if you get high and that tweaks,

556
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,020
that little thing in my brain that goes 
on here.

557
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:48,260
I go,
remember in your brain for 30 years,

558
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:50,090
right?
I'm from the sixties,

559
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,890
right?
With the best of them.

560
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,000
I got high and it took them down.
Some of them,

561
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:56,630
most of them.

562
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,840
You came through it remarkably unscathed
if you think about it.

563
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,190
Yeah.
Thank you God.

564
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,410
It's pretty amazing.
Thank you God.

565
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,000
Thank you.
God.

566
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,760
Think about that one.
Yeah.

567
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,470
Think about that.
We could talk for two hours.

568
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:12,900
About Times I did shit and almost died.
So sure.

569
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,460
You know,
and then I could also tell you how many 

570
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:23,180
times I took shit and wrote things like,
you know,

571
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,510
I'm listening to this guitar lick that 
Joe's playing.

572
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,410
He did an interview here with you.
Yeah,

573
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,280
but he didn't tell you how in his 
fucking sleepy loop play these riffs.

574
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,900
And I come down the hallway because,
you know,

575
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,890
as I see it,
of course not as ace it,

576
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,300
but as I see it,
we were up in New England and he was 

577
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,300
playing at a place and I mowed the lawn,
my,

578
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,840
my,
my,

579
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,870
my parents place.
And I quit my last band and I was 

580
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,490
fucking a Lou who saw her.

581
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,280
I was crying.
I was no more bands.

582
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,310
The dream was over.
He drives up in an mg.

583
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,550
We go and he's playing that night.
I swear to God this happened and so we 

584
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:06,461
decided to move down to Boston,
but all in an apartment because I 

585
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,330
thought I knew why those bands didn't 
make it.

586
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,520
But I knew in my heart did,
if I had a broan abandoned,

587
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,650
like I'm making a keith.
Like the kinks.

588
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,770
Yeah.
David,

589
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,380
David,
you know ray,

590
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,780
any of those bands they had.
They,

591
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,080
you have.
It was two guys that were really tight.

592
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,000
They feed off each other.
The Fed off each other.

593
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,430
Exactly.
So we moved down there.

594
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,100
I got really tight with Joe.
I hear him.

595
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,050
He'd get,
we get so swept.

596
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,320
We were so stoned on bullying.
Boone's farm.

597
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,990
You mean fucking.

598
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,500
I said,
what'd you say?

599
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,770
What'd you say?
Anyway,

600
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:48,771
but he would play these licks.
It was so fucking for every song you've 

601
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:48,930
ever heard.
Sweet emotion.

602
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Every one of those legs walk this way.
There's 20 that got lost in the ether 

603
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,770
ether.
So I went out and bought a little thing 

604
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:02,770
called the tape recorder back then 
remember this was 71.

605
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,070
You know,
a lot of shit.

606
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,850
Wasn't no phones,
no cell phones.

607
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,210
So I would record that shit.
And so anyway,

608
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,350
where we're going with this,
that's,

609
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,680
that's what,
that's where these songs came from and 

610
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,721
stuff would come out of my head while I 
was like sweet white.

611
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,200
Well Fuck,
get me paper,

612
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,140
paper and pen.
I write that shit down suddenly.

613
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,030
Whoops.
On the radio.

614
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,760
So I used that place.
You get,

615
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,010
you go to,
when you eat edibles you have a right.

616
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:37,530
Some of your routines when you know for 
sure.

617
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:42,620
Well and also check this out.
The best part of it is when I got sober 

618
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,810
I started writing even better shit.
I go in a room with four guys and say 

619
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:52,520
we're going into right ahead.
We're going to say in this fucking room 

620
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,430
until we do or until we can't stand each
other smell.

621
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,990
And we would leave in seven hours with a
fucking song and a good one and one that

622
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:03,840
would live way past all those.
Check that shooter.

623
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:09,000
What did it feel like when you,
when you did have these drunk and stoned

624
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:12,050
moments when you came up with a song 
like sweet emotion or riff or.

625
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,640
And then all of a sudden you're 
listening to it on the radio.

626
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,800
How,
how fucking surreal is that?

627
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,820
What does that like?
I remember we used to go up to um,

628
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,090
first of all,
most of our first stuff was recorded 

629
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,090
down in Hell's kitchen.

630
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,210
I'm in New York with the record plant,
you know,

631
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:35,211
John Lennon had a studio upstairs and we
were down in studio way with Jack 

632
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:39,410
Douglas and um,
so we went from there for the seventies 

633
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,940
and then end of the seventies.
I don't every drug on the planet that I 

634
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:47,610
could because I thought it was cool and 
if I didn't I wouldn't be cool.

635
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,650
And those were the kinds of people I 
hung out with.

636
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,810
You can't do that dude.
You ain't fucking shit man.

637
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,310
So.
And you get early eighties.

638
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,820
Totally full bar.
80 four 85.

639
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,590
80 six.
What was eighties coke?

640
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,950
A lot of the hard stuff.
Yeah,

641
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,270
70 snorting heroin,
snorting coke.

642
00:29:07,271 --> 00:29:11,540
The sixties and seventies was sixties 
was we'd write,

643
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,710
bringing,
getting jiggy with,

644
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,920
you know,
with the stuff that was happening with 

645
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,380
the English invasion.
Listened to Elvis and checking shit out,

646
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,360
you know?
Um,

647
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,100
and what about the seventies?

648
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,570
Seventies finally supposed 65.
Sixty four.

649
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,110
I started.
I was a drummer in a band at school.

650
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,170
You know,
the Burlington school drama,

651
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,810
then I bought a set of drums because I 
wasn't getting looked at and get made 

652
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,230
fun of and called,
you know,

653
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,730
Lipo and Lithuania and got beat up after
school and then I thought if we get a 

654
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:51,670
little band together and play as lunch,
have you really cool?

655
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,810
We recall the maniacs,
so we played a lunch and I went,

656
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,190
Holy Shit.
Marcy,

657
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,850
Marcia resnick is talking to me now.
Holy Shit.

658
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,430
Whatever.
Yeah.

659
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,670
Isn't it funny?
There's always one girl high school,

660
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,060
kill Ellsworth.
Whew.

661
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,120
That was her.
And she looked at me and no one did 

662
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,120
before.
It was no different than,

663
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,340
you know,
human.

664
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,690
So then 65,
66,

665
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,010
67,
chain reactions.

666
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:19,300
Sixty eight.
The strangers.

667
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,620
Sixty nine was woodstock.
I went early and left.

668
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,100
Three days later I still have a coca 
cola cooler.

669
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,010
We,
the day it was over.

670
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:35,011
Okay.
We tried to start a paccar and too much 

671
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:35,011
water got in the gas.
We couldn't,

672
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:39,480
couldn't get lost and everybody left and
all their tents and sleeping bags were 

673
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:44,050
just left there.
Hundreds of acres of tents.

674
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:47,200
There's no pictures on it.
I walked around and I thought,

675
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,420
so I stole a coke cooler and I still 
have that to this day.

676
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,520
Still haven't.
Oh yeah,

677
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,210
yeah,
yeah.

678
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,600
But I was a great from Coca Cola,
like they were selling your shit and 

679
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:57,730
just,
you know,

680
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,100
where the opening on the side,
you know,

681
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,210
but I remember walking down this path,
it was called groovy way and I stole.

682
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I stole this banner off the trees,
which we used for the,

683
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,600
for errors within the beginning I had 
these girls duplicated.

684
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:19,450
So it was,
it was two guys looking at each other,

685
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,860
you know,
smoking a joint and at that was the 

686
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,000
aerosmith thing in the beginning.
But when I was at Woodstock,

687
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:30,001
I'm walking down groovy way and it was,
where can keasy and the magic,

688
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,290
the pranksters had older buses,
so I'm tripping on acid and these 

689
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:40,231
helicopters are coming by with 500 
pounds of hot dogs and they're dropping 

690
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,200
them,
dropping them in the field.

691
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,770
You hear this,
I'm sure you're not.

692
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,860
And then another giant pile of pots and 
pans to cook the hot dogs.

693
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:52,870
I mean,
it was a disaster area.

694
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,190
Woodstock,
you know this,

695
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:55,650
right?
Yeah.

696
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,520
Anyway,
so I grabbed the pots and pans.

697
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,000
I started,

698
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,110
so when the guy walks over and he's 
going,

699
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,080
okay,

700
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,960
another guy comes over and he starts 
doing this.

701
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,300
By the time I was done in an hour later,
there was 50 people banging on every 

702
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,370
pot.
That was a moment and then when I got up

703
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:27,050
from that tripping my ass off,
I walked down a path and walking towards

704
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:32,051
me was one guy and it was joey cream 
with my trauma who I knew from high 

705
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:36,360
school,
but then I met there later on to become.

706
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,090
I was a drummer for aerosmith in the 
beginning.

707
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,210
Move forward now,
six or 70,

708
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,110
all the bands that broke up.
I went up to sunapee.

709
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,840
I was mowing the lawn at place called 
Trial Rico.

710
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,660
My family place that I did my whole 
life.

711
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,130
It's what I do,
or I'm a country boy.

712
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,550
Three hundred and 60 acres that my 
Italian family bought that came over 

713
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:02,651
from Calabria in 1918.
Ninety five brothers.

714
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,290
There were musicians,
so they worked in New York City.

715
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,920
They made a little money,
so for four grand they bought 300 acres,

716
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:14,920
so every year of my life when I was born
in fucking 1940.

717
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,810
I mean it's like what,
how,

718
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,340
you know,
I know I was 70 couple of months ago,

719
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:26,120
but I feel like I just,
when people would say that,

720
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,350
it was like what?
My daughter,

721
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,350
my daughter Chelsea would say,
it's a big one,

722
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,460
dad,
you got to stay here.

723
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,040
We got to celebrate it.
And I,

724
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,610
I know I have no concept of time.
I feel like on one hand I've lived 300 

725
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:43,380
lives already and the other I feel like 
it just.

726
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,140
How does that,
what's that number?

727
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,530
That's a fuck of a big number.
Does it feel like it just happened?

728
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,360
Oh,
it definitely,

729
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,510
like you look back and think of like 
aerosmith's first gigs and feel like 

730
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:59,230
God,
it just feels like a couple of years 

731
00:33:59,230 --> 00:33:59,230
ago,
a couple of years ago,

732
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,650
couple years ago when.
That's the thing about aerosmith.

733
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:02,550
Okay.
So we went up in Santa Fe.

734
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:05,710
He drove by in his leg and his glasses 
with white tape in the middle.

735
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,800
I'm telling you,
man,

736
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,010
hair down to here.
Come on man.

737
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:10,820
Come here.
My band.

738
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,130
So I went and heard him.
It was a jewel Perry project.

739
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,820
No,
it was uh,

740
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,750
um,
the jam band Joe Berry Jam band.

741
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,280
And they were the only one.
Someone who was good.

742
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,820
I won't get into it because they 
couldn't,

743
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,410
you know,
they weren't in tune and shit,

744
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,650
but they played rattlesnake shake,
you know,

745
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:31,900
by um,
um,

746
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,030
Mick fleetwood,
you know,

747
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,580
fluid Mac.
And when I heard that I said I sat there

748
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:42,581
and I went,
life flashed all the bands that I was 

749
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:42,581
in.
I broke up.

750
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:46,780
I know why.
And I knew that if I take all the shit 

751
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,860
that I know and put it into that and try
to carve that shit out.

752
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,050
If we can live together,
smoke weed together,

753
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:52,760
fuck girls together in the same 
apartment,

754
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,690
we'll have it.

755
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,140
And all I want to do is get my fucking 
toe in the door.

756
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,620
That's all I ever wanted to do.
If I could just get into the comedy 

757
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,870
club,
another feel.

758
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,360
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

759
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,610
So when we moved to Boston and I'm the 
drummer and one day rates of ant or a 

760
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,240
guitar player at the time walks in and 
goes,

761
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,440
yeah,
I got a friend of yours because I didn't

762
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:21,110
really want to play the drums here 
behind everybody.

763
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:23,060
You know,
you get pissed off.

764
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,790
Your wife wonders why you're not on the 
cover of something.

765
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,910
Right.
So I want to be lead singer because I 

766
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,820
want to get laid.
Well,

767
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,260
what do you want to do?
Well,

768
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,510
Tommy Lee was the drummer.
Oh,

769
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,340
well he had a fucking 12 inch cock that 
helped.

770
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,150
Okay.
That helps.

771
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,490
That's good looking guy too.
Tommy Lee,

772
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,030
right.
What?

773
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,860
That helps.
But they have to see it first to know 

774
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,440
and believe me,
they showed it.

775
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:56,900
We used to.
We were up in Vancouver doing our best 

776
00:35:57,121 --> 00:36:02,121
records and Nikki Sixx,
dear friend of mine,

777
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,730
he was in my way with me and I said,
you know what man,

778
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,300
we got to climb to the top of that hill.
You've got to stop smoking.

779
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,450
And we did.
We climbed to the very top of the hill 

780
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:14,450
right above new beach,
little beach and big beach.

781
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:14,760
Anyway,
it's fuck,

782
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,320
it's like this.
He was like,

783
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,920
and we quit smoking and he got sober.
We went to a meeting that night and 

784
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:28,071
everything.
I got up to Vancouver and there in 

785
00:36:28,071 --> 00:36:28,830
Studio B.
We're in studio a.

786
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,970
he's with a Bob Rock.
They're producing this album called and 

787
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,690
they asked me to sing on it and Dr 
[inaudible],

788
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,690
right.
[inaudible]

789
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,210
and the fucking record.
It was one of the first times musicians,

790
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:50,211
when you get your shirt put on a 
protools and it gets fixed into you 

791
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:50,840
anymore.
See,

792
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,130
I'm from the old school where if you 
practice and get good,

793
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:58,190
you're good.
So what you did at the comedy store the 

794
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,260
first time you can do in your basement 
in front of your kids,

795
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,890
we just as good.
So don't you think so pro tools for 

796
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,560
musicians.
It's like it can,

797
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:09,570
it can take your,
your vocal and fix it.

798
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,600
You can take your drums and put it in,
fixed it to a grid.

799
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,470
Does that do what are you going to do 
better?

800
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,670
But it does make the music sound better,
but never listened to charlie watts.

801
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,110
Right?
Right.

802
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,000
He drags so beautifully and Keith 
Richards,

803
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,920
but that wasn't my point is it?
Is there.

804
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,330
There's something missing from that.

805
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:32,340
Right?
The soul is gone because now it's 

806
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:32,340
computerized and even though it's really
good,

807
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,840
it's still not the same as listening to 
James Brown just thinking about this.

808
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,190
Yeah,
they got a new song,

809
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,900
each brand,
but yeah,

810
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:42,120
if they're all using pro tools and 
fixing shit.

811
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,540
Yeah,
it's the same sound coming out right 

812
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:47,540
now.
Maybe a different singer,

813
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,750
but sustained feeling.
Right and you,

814
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,640
by the way,
you can do it really professionally.

815
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:55,641
You can look in my eyes.
Some of my dear friends Marti 

816
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:55,641
Fredrickson,
Nuno Betancourt,

817
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,640
these fuckers gotta get behind it and 
ready for your vocal.

818
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

819
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,580
I will come up with a hey jade head.
You got your Mama's style,

820
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,040
but show yesterday.
Child to me,

821
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,510
done.
Recorded.

822
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,940
They move it there.
They move it there.

823
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,230
They move it there.
They've got the drum and saying,

824
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:12,750
go,
listen.

825
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,490
You think we've got a song?
And I go,

826
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:19,820
you think that that's how easy it is?
That's how he and I've done that many 

827
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:24,120
times.
Do you miss the raw?

828
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,490
No.
Changing,

829
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:31,491
no adjusting,
no one a women saying I've done that 

830
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,520
many times.
I've taken like,

831
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:36,970
what did I do that on pink?
I'm down in Florida.

832
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,760
Uh,
I'm at the island hotel.

833
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,920
I'm living in the room.
I'm sober as can be.

834
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:50,850
When I say that,
that means like when the sun went down 

835
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,920
and I turned the light on and I start 
reading pink is,

836
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,910
you're in a minute.
Loops obsession.

837
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,870
Pink

838
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,310
ain't even no question

839
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,710
pink

840
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,670
on the lips or your lover

841
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,150
pink,

842
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:16,470
what you will discover.
And I think it's just,

843
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,820
that's how it went,
right?

844
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,910
So I did that for until the sun came up 
and I turned the light off.

845
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,990
So use that time period of the night for
the whole album.

846
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,780
That whole album was.
I wrote everything at night when I was,

847
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:33,400
I would get so tired,
I feel stoned and I would write and then

848
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:37,990
I would take the lyrics of pink and I 
wrote seven verses,

849
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,680
which you only needed three,
but I wrote seven aerosmith's biggest 

850
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,920
secret.
Wrote 21 songs.

851
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,890
Only put 14 on an album.
Hello?

852
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,590
Pick the best out of 21.
You're going to have a good album that's

853
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,190
like you go in somewhere for three 
months,

854
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,830
right in your new fucking skit,
your new skin,

855
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,670
and you get,
you hit on you doing your edibles or 

856
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:02,670
whatever.
It gets you off.

857
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,730
You hit on three fucking incredible 
things.

858
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,540
You write them through,
you come back and if you want to,

859
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,240
you can do all three if you want to,
on your worst day.

860
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,240
The worst one is great because you,
Joe Rogan,

861
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:16,570
you already know what good is.
You know what funny is,

862
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,190
you know how to make that,
you know,

863
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:20,110
how to weave something together.
Alright?

864
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:25,170
So I put it,
and this would be for protools to thing 

865
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,871
called a dats.
And so the guy we're working with says,

866
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,110
sing that chorus,
say saying that verse.

867
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,120
And so we already had the course.
I sang that first.

868
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:41,260
He just put that verse in all world 
versus go.

869
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,270
And I listened back and I went,
fuck,

870
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,110
we've got such a great song here.
That's how it used pro tools.

871
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:49,600
I don't use it to manipulate.
I'll never,

872
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,850
I'll never fixed my vocal.
Um,

873
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,520
but your vocals,
there's something about your vocals that

874
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,530
you wouldn't enhance them if you fixed 
them,

875
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,980
like you have a raw,
soulful quality to your voice that if 

876
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,750
you fucked with that digitized,
you'd lose all of it.

877
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:10,020
I mean,
I'm sure they can do some things that 

878
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:10,850
the real artists with pro tools and move
things around.

879
00:41:10,851 --> 00:41:14,710
Those still sound amazing,
but there's no errors in your singing.

880
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,040
You know what I'm saying?
Any crackle or pop is just gonna be 

881
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,041
better when you learn that.
I feel that as I thought it was an 

882
00:41:23,041 --> 00:41:26,311
adult,
as a person who doesn't look for 

883
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:26,311
perfection,
you just look for beauty.

884
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:28,500
You know,
perfection is not beauty now.

885
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,610
I mean it's,
it's an unattainable thing.

886
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Chase it.
And you can get excellence and wrong 

887
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:35,640
with America

888
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,030
right now is everybody's trying to look 
for that perfection and stuff.

889
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,190
Fat In their ass.
He.

890
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,590
Yeah,
yeah,

891
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,560
yeah.
But there is no perfection.

892
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:45,370
In fact,
this imperfection.

893
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm a perfectionist.
So for losing to the first album,

894
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,030
some of my first songs,
it comes once a day on the shade a 

895
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,540
window.
Boom.

896
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,310
Shit,
I'm watching Janis Joplin.

897
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,630
I went,
what the fuck?

898
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,470
And Mick Jagger and fucking little 
Richard,

899
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,920
the when the beetles are just,
you know,

900
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,040
Paul's,
Paul's daughter texts me all the time,

901
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,630
you know,
when she's beautiful,

902
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,550
she's fucking line or close beyond 
belief.

903
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,380
And um,
she goes,

904
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,150
dad's having drinks.
Come on over.

905
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,910
So this was three nights ago.
God drinks coke.

906
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:28,370
You can smoke a spliff all day here with
10 bags of coke and I'll watch you.

907
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,930
Actually,
I just don't do it.

908
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,370
I understand.
I got that strength.

909
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,990
Know what I'm saying?
Thank you Lord.

910
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,520
I thank you guys.
I appreciate it.

911
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:39,521
So I walk in and I'm doesn't mean that I
want to do it while I'm watching this 

912
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:41,870
one and that one do it.
I get it and want to crawl up her ass.

913
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,470
My friend Doug Stanhope says he's 
waiting to do heroin right before he 

914
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:47,470
dies.
Oh,

915
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:47,470
it's fun.
I heard.

916
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:47,990
It's amazing.
Think about it.

917
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,550
When do they give you more feeling right
before you die?

918
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:50,830
No,
no,

919
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,080
no,
no.

920
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,840
That's.
I don't know what that drug is.

921
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,860
We have to give you something like that.
They've done that to you.

922
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,590
When do they give you morphine?
When you're in pain?

923
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,770
Exactly what?
Human isn't in pain or all the fucking 

924
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:02,770
time.
A lot of people are.

925
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,181
They've all time.
Those who can't get their shit together 

926
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:09,660
and night they go home and jerk off and 
then they drink a beer and they smoke 

927
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,820
and you know what I mean?
It's a little hard for people.

928
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,570
They don't make enough money.
They vote for trump.

929
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,040
Whatever the fuck's going on in America 
right now,

930
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,220
I can't figure it out,
but a lot of people like I was when I 

931
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:21,710
was younger,
aren't paying.

932
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,620
Yeah.
Girlfriends leave you here.

933
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,870
Pain that white picket fence in that and
the and the wife.

934
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,330
Eighteen years she leaves you.
You had two kids.

935
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:30,410
I'm in fucking pain.

936
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:34,930
I'm in pain,
so what's the best thing to do?

937
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,590
Is that the best thing to do though?
No,

938
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:41,330
it's not,
but that's why they do it.

939
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,950
What is the best thing to do when you're
in pain?

940
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,980
Well,
we have to be a little bit elevated as 

941
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:47,980
humans to know what to do.
In that case,

942
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,910
you listen to people like Marianne 
Williamson.

943
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,830
I don't know who she is.
She's fucking brilliant.

944
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Do you know she has Jamie.
He doesn't fucking virtual piano.

945
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,870
She's just a spiritual person.
The spiritual.

946
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,300
When I got sober,
I started listening to her tapes.

947
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:09,100
I get on the treadmill in the morning,
you know,

948
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,840
because I,
I can't eat it.

949
00:44:10,841 --> 00:44:13,900
I don't even feel alive unless I'm out 
of breath.

950
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:17,950
That's what I get for being a musician.
I lose a pound a night on stage.

951
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,780
Sweating with aerosmith.
Right.

952
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,180
I'm up there with standing next to 
fucking Joe Perry.

953
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:26,350
Really?
The last of the real rock stars you,

954
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,330
you stood across from him is a bad 
motherfucker.

955
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,920
I don't know if he was stoned out with 
you,

956
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:30,700
but he's.

957
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,150
When I get text messages from him,
like,

958
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:36,390
Holy Shit,
I fucking texts.

959
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:40,450
And I saw him in the beginning and I 
knew he was something special.

960
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,410
I knew he was,
that.

961
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,020
He's got a.
he's got a recognizable.

962
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:46,420
There's certain people that have a 
sound.

963
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,660
You know Joe has.
He absolutely has a sound.

964
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:52,100
You know as a sound.
Gary Clark Junior,

965
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,520
like you hear Gary Clark Jr,
play guitar.

966
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:55,180
You Go,
oh,

967
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,640
that's a Gary Clark Jr riff.
You know,

968
00:44:57,641 --> 00:44:59,260
there's certain people that have a 
sound.

969
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,620
Joel most certainly has a sound.
It's like he's expressing himself 

970
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:09,100
through that guitar in a very 
recognizable way into together,

971
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:10,960
man,
what a fucking combination that was with

972
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,160
his guitar and your voice and here's,
but here's.

973
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,330
Yeah,

974
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,000
and here's the trip.
In the beginning,

975
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,830
in the first album,
people have said,

976
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,150
who say on the second album a second.
Now my kind of like that peewee Herman 

977
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,220
fucking put that because I want to sound
black.

978
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,960
Oh Fuck,
I'm not stupid.

979
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:37,990
I get it.
I wanted to put some fucking soul soul 

980
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,471
in my voice.
I knew I had it and trying to force it 

981
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:42,050
out.
No,

982
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,580
no.
What I learned was,

983
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,120
you know,
like from a Nat King Cole,

984
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,130
he's the kind of music.
I listen to it as a kid.

985
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,660
When I met Natalie,
I walked up behind her and I went chemo,

986
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:57,260
Como stairs,
tear behind my rump steak,

987
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,440
a pumping.
Who Bang,

988
00:45:58,441 --> 00:46:00,110
nip care,
parliament cameo.

989
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,360
I love you.
She went,

990
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,550
no one is song that ever.
Two weeks at my daddy said to dad passed

991
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:09,170
obviously way before,
but that's,

992
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,260
those are the records I listened to that
was not singing his best shit.

993
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,770
And um,
so I wanted to say,

994
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,460
well,
here's what I wanted to sound.

995
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:22,160
I want to say I'm more like Joe Perry 
was playing and singing really sweet and

996
00:46:22,161 --> 00:46:22,910
nice.
A dream.

997
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,030
Sweet and Nice.
I kinda,

998
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:28,930
I kinda went there and when we wrote a 
song on a waterbed,

999
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,940
Joe Perry and I were sitting around 
smoking a big fatty and Mark Lehman was 

1000
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:39,131
there.
He was our road manager and we show 

1001
00:46:39,131 --> 00:46:39,131
goes,
burn,

1002
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,800
burn,
burn,

1003
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,060
burn along,

1004
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:48,990
man.
Man,

1005
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:49,480
man,
man,

1006
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,420
man,
we in there.

1007
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm looking at him and that was a 
sentence he spoke to me and I said,

1008
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,280
we all live on the edge of town where we
all live in.

1009
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:08,110
And so when new people start,
me and all,

1010
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,060
we'll do just a grid and got to move our
city moving in.

1011
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,600
Some saying she taught you spoke to me 
and you.

1012
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,920
I answered,
translated it.

1013
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,370
Well,
I would listen to the bay,

1014
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,970
we would sit around and we would jam.
That's what we did the best and we would

1015
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:27,971
create this music and I will put the 
headphones on later because I'm the 

1016
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,420
lyricist and I wrote the melody.
I see you.

1017
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:34,240
When I heard Joe's band,
I thought I'm going to take my dad,

1018
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,720
vic Tallerico who went to Julliard in 
New York and I grew up in the bronx,

1019
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,460
56,
10 Netherland Avenue,

1020
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:46,500
six g the apartment and I grew up under 
the piano and I listen to.

1021
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,450
My Dad would practice everyday on a 
steinway.

1022
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,860
So who lived between the notes show,
you know what I'm saying?

1023
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,570
I love you.
Name's Joe.

1024
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:01,290
I just love Joe's fucking loved you.
I fucking love you know he's my bro.

1025
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:03,250
You go her.
What the fuck man.

1026
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:06,250
It's always been there.
So.

1027
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:09,670
But anyway,
so I took my melody.

1028
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,280
You know what I hear when I listened to 
him playing.

1029
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,330
Whoa Shit.
When did your second album,

1030
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,990
and you did that little sort of 
expectation,

1031
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:21,940
is that how you would call it a voice?
Did you,

1032
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,180
after you heard it and you listened to 
people talking about it,

1033
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,250
did you decide to change it for the next
album?

1034
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,080
Wow,
sending.

1035
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,370
I did just go away for a minute,
didn't I?

1036
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,730
Yeah.
I love it when I do that.

1037
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,140
Yeah.
The,

1038
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,440
the melody that I learned from my dad 
and then listening to the music we 

1039
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,440
listened to,
you know,

1040
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:47,071
Dorsey and a Frank Sinatra and nat king 
Cole and,

1041
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,080
and then Janice Joplin and affiliate 
thugs who were the first ones to put on 

1042
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:56,560
the back of their album,
a lunatic vagina.

1043
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,070
That's who.
So who say sang the song is 61,

1044
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,520
the mothers of invention.
He's fucking bands.

1045
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:04,330
And I went,
what?

1046
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:09,600
So I thought singing really,
like my dad taught me and the notes and 

1047
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:12,030
write on and you know,
c,

1048
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:12,750
d,
e,

1049
00:49:12,751 --> 00:49:13,800
F,
G A,

1050
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:15,670
b.
You don't have a fuck.

1051
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,250
Wrong,
wrong,

1052
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:21,380
wrong.
You've got to.

1053
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:26,450
Not only that,
but if you don't put inflections into 

1054
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:29,141
it,
ain't no feeling and there ain't no 

1055
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:29,141
meaning.

1056
00:49:29,141 --> 00:49:31,320
I got you lock.
I do last time.

1057
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,000
Whoops.
Right where you say it,

1058
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,230
but you have to feel it can't be 
something you're trying to feel.

1059
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,700
It's got to be something you actually 
feel.

1060
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:43,570
Does that make sense?
Yeah.

1061
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:44,840
But I think,
you know,

1062
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,650
Joe,
hats off to him,

1063
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,280
men,
um,

1064
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,900
the way he played his guitar and 
practice at night,

1065
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:54,610
he fucking nod out and he'd be sitting 
in his chair and the fucking chair,

1066
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,640
the couch caught on fire to,
through with a pot of water and he's 

1067
00:49:59,640 --> 00:49:59,950
laying smoke.
I want y'all.

1068
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:04,951
What the fuck man get?
He's playing this riff and we turned it 

1069
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,880
into a song.
This kind of stuff happens so much.

1070
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,610
And he did it away to me.
Fucking a obviously,

1071
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,200
you know,
Tom Hamilton,

1072
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:12,140
du Du,
Du,

1073
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:12,950
Du,
Du,

1074
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:13,390
Du,
Du,

1075
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:14,000
Du,
Du,

1076
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:14,340
Du,
Du,

1077
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:14,690
Du,
Du,

1078
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:19,000
and a sweet motion.
That's how band comes together,

1079
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:24,001
you know?
And I can't tell you any other way than 

1080
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:24,001
that.

1081
00:50:24,001 --> 00:50:28,170
Magic and every inch of the way,
the reason it doesn't feel like I'm 70 

1082
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,560
and I don't feel the time.
It feels like yesterday we just started 

1083
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,340
is because every time I'm on stage,
I'm singing those same fucking songs 

1084
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:36,740
again,
same way,

1085
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,780
same feeling,
same looking,

1086
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,640
same people,
different people,

1087
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,820
different people.
But I'm singing the same songs.

1088
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,220
Do you know the guy that's looking to.
Anyway,

1089
00:50:46,221 --> 00:50:51,221
so to answer your question,
second album sounds a little bit more 

1090
00:50:51,221 --> 00:50:55,000
Raunchy,
more in tune with Joe's guitar and I 

1091
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,720
think we found our sound second album,
third,

1092
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,200
fourth,
fifth,

1093
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:57,710
six,
seven,

1094
00:50:57,711 --> 00:50:58,070
eight,
nine,

1095
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:58,490
10,
11,

1096
00:50:58,491 --> 00:50:59,240
12.
We got it.

1097
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,750
But it took that first album,
had songs on it like walking the dog 

1098
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,310
because we were,
we ran out of songs with.

1099
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,010
That was the only played in clubs.
I remember we had a contract.

1100
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,660
What are we going to do?

1101
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,160
So we wrote moving out.
Then the guys would get stoned and drink

1102
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:17,690
boone's farm and I go,
come on you guys.

1103
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,150
We fucking wrote this song,
fuck you.

1104
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:23,660
And flick the joint.
So I remember getting pissed off walking

1105
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,100
out.
They hate me when I tell this story,

1106
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:30,101
but I remember being really fucking 
angry walking out to his piano and 

1107
00:51:30,101 --> 00:51:32,210
writing one way street.
Um,

1108
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:36,290
I don't play guitar and I wrote about 
don't go on and do it,

1109
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,020
make it,
don't break it first on the first album.

1110
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,850
So some great shit because I feel like,
you know,

1111
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,780
in anger,
you know,

1112
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:46,880
I didn't know what to do but I just 
bought a,

1113
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,940
used that.
So I wrote a bunch of songs and I think 

1114
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,190
it late everybody's fuse.
I think that Joe certainly lit mine.

1115
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,490
Tom Hamilton,
his outtakes as he called him.

1116
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:04,270
Sweet emotion.
That's Tom Hamilton now through 

1117
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:04,880
throughout this whole time.

1118
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,550
Were you exercising back then?
Did you do things?

1119
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,330
How do you move around back then?
Or were you just living life because you

1120
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:16,331
say you,
you're always trying to be an out of 

1121
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:16,331
breath.
You're always doing things physically.

1122
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:16,410
No,
no.

1123
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:19,190
What I'm saying now is just like,
it's like when I started getting sober I

1124
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:19,940
thought,
fuck,

1125
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:24,941
I got a treadmill and I got into shape.
And you didn't do that before you got 

1126
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:24,941
sober?
No,

1127
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:25,340
because we were on tour three,
three shows a week.

1128
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:29,870
I was 127 pounds.
I was just skinny,

1129
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:32,390
Minnie and just trying to.
There was no MTV.

1130
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:36,440
We had to play by.
Just check this out,

1131
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,160
you to wonder what drugs I took and why 
people get enamored by that.

1132
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,830
But take it out of the picture.
We got high.

1133
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,610
I got high because my manager was 
getting stoned too.

1134
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,180
They loved it when bands were stoned 
because they can hand us a piece of 

1135
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:52,400
paper and we would sign it.

1136
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,520
Uh Oh.
Fifty percent of all of our publishing.

1137
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,880
Thanks pal.
And words like in perpetuity,

1138
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,930
he's fucking managers back then.
I can tell you the dark secrets.

1139
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:08,050
Please.
Do you do your own urine or do I just 

1140
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:08,850
told you the dark secret is they'd get 
your high and get you to on.

1141
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:14,080
We all got high together,
but they knew when you were getting 

1142
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,080
fucked up.
You know here.

1143
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:14,150
Sign this.
No.

1144
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:20,190
Oh,
managers loved it when their bands were 

1145
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:20,190
fucked up.
Think about it.

1146
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,380
Hendricks stoned out of his fuck here.
Sign this.

1147
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,100
Yeah.
John Lennon thought what was his name?

1148
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,900
New Broom when he got a new lawyer and 
Paul was with,

1149
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,450
with the lender.
You know,

1150
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,630
it's,
it's what happens back then.

1151
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,730
You get your conference today too,
right?

1152
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,950
I mean,
the record business has always been that

1153
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:42,000
way always because artists are impulsive
and they're not business wise and people

1154
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,260
come along and exploit that.

1155
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:48,260
Yes.
Very impulsive to think of what it 

1156
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:48,260
takes.
If you study this for a second,

1157
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:52,410
what does it take for a bunch of guys 
were not in love with each other.

1158
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,290
Um,
we love.

1159
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,280
I love.
I love.

1160
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,020
I really love what you just said.
What's your name again?

1161
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,450
Young.
Young.

1162
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,560
Jamie.
I love what you just said.

1163
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:03,380
Can we talk after this?
Can I.

1164
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:08,390
w,
w we tell me that again so I can write 

1165
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:08,390
it down.
So,

1166
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:11,950
you know,
say get five guys together to love what 

1167
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:11,950
each other's doing.
I love it with Joey Kramer.

1168
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,460
Place Brad Whitford.
Plays Guitar like a madman.

1169
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,500
Joe Perry,
Tom Hamilton,

1170
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,670
you know,
to love what these guys do and then 

1171
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:22,080
write songs.
Who are we?

1172
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,360
Who are.
We were fucking in writing songs for 48 

1173
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,910
years.
Still want to turn on the radio one.

1174
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,550
I hear sweet emotion and that fucking 
song I don't want.

1175
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,060
What is it?
I didn't want to kiss your thing.

1176
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:39,880
No,
no.

1177
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,780
I don't want to miss a thing.
I just fucking.

1178
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:44,380
Here's our turn.
So turn around here.

1179
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,130
That old shit.
What magic we had,

1180
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:51,510
what magic it takes for David Grohl to 
sit down and scribbling.

1181
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:54,600
He's a fucking for as old as he is.
He's 12.

1182
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,450
I loved when I walked into Paul 
Mccartney's party,

1183
00:54:57,451 --> 00:54:59,530
you know,
uh,

1184
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,280
what's his name was walking out,
present me help.

1185
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,530
Dr Dre was walking out.
I walked in and there was rainbow and it

1186
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:12,420
was oprah and there was,
I mean everybody that I live on Maui.

1187
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:15,380
So I lived there with live in Maui.
Oh yeah.

1188
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:20,540
Really you don't get because everybody 
thinks mallory's.

1189
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,310
Maui Wowie back in 70.
That's still.

1190
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,270
Well,
I don't know,

1191
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:24,790
in seven,
eight,

1192
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,340
10.
Think that I could buy.

1193
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:30,960
I could buy a case of Maui buds and have
it sent right to my house.

1194
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:35,310
I did it all the time from Maui.
It was called Maui Wowie.

1195
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,260
I've heard that name before.
Anyway,

1196
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:39,210
everybody you lived there right now?
I live there right now.

1197
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:40,380
Okay.
Look at.

1198
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,510
That's got to be.
But I'm in an old fashioned band.

1199
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:43,620
We all get paid the same.

1200
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:46,990
You okay?

1201
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,120
Oh,
what an old fashioned fucking man.

1202
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:57,121
Who does that?
He paid Rhiana how much you think she 

1203
00:55:57,121 --> 00:56:00,040
makes a night in this and the dancers?
I don't think.

1204
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,990
Well,
there's a big difference between the 

1205
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:05,990
dancers and the dancers.
And you got married.

1206
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,700
What were the band?
It's all.

1207
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:07,820
We all get paid the same.
Right?

1208
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:13,120
When I took idol,
could you started making some paper?

1209
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,630
Get that paper?
Fuck yeah.

1210
00:56:15,631 --> 00:56:17,610
That's what everybody made fun of me 
and.

1211
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:19,270
But believe me,
did you do it just for the money?

1212
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,560
No,
but,

1213
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:22,630
but no.
You know what?

1214
00:56:22,631 --> 00:56:23,350
I did.
Why?

1215
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:28,770
Because I thought nobody knew who I was.
Everybody knows this guy singing and 

1216
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
nobody knew you ever use this guy.
Oh my value as a human.

1217
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:40,500
My Mom's passed away and she said,
she said they need to see that side of 

1218
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,550
you.
You as a person,

1219
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,830
but you decided that American idol was 
the best way to show that.

1220
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,370
I thought that was the first thing was 
what else was.

1221
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,240
I had no managers back then that had the
good sense to offer me anything.

1222
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,060
I got the offer from Marti Fredrickson.
I got,

1223
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,200
how long ago was this?
How long have you been on this for?

1224
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,700
Two thousand.
Two thousand.

1225
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,190
10.
11.

1226
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:11,250
Eleven to 12.
I got to sit next to j Lo and Randy 

1227
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,420
Jackson at motherfucker.
Beautiful Guy.

1228
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:15,530
Jj Long.
J.

1229
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:19,000
Lo's beautiful.
You know what else may need.

1230
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,370
I think what everyone needs some word 
called incentive,

1231
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:23,080
right?
Is it her ass?

1232
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,750
It was her assets time.
I looked at it a little time,

1233
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:27,580
but she'd say,
you're harassing me.

1234
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:30,850
And I'd say who's asked her ass?
Yeah,

1235
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:35,851
I know,
but the funniest fucking thing is we 

1236
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:36,670
would do all three of us and I think 
that's missing now,

1237
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:40,610
but all three of us,
you know,

1238
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,510
to do American idol,
you got to go to des Moines,

1239
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:48,511
Iowa in a gym and you're all set up with
a whole crew and you know,

1240
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,760
three people with these microphones,
you know,

1241
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,910
the 12 foot mics hanging down over your 
head like this.

1242
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:57,950
And 12 cameras in high def up Europe was
who?

1243
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,650
And but,
but in 50,

1244
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:05,380
40 people a day would come through all 
these 15,

1245
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:10,381
16 year old 17 year old little trollops 
with red lipstick on and push up Ross 

1246
00:58:11,891 --> 00:58:16,891
and going to an a kid outta here,
you know,

1247
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:20,350
after the eight ft,
after the 30th 40th one.

1248
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:22,000
You're sitting there doing this.
Right.

1249
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:23,390
You know,
so he just got,

1250
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:28,570
he got to do,
you need that incentive from each other 

1251
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:31,210
and sometimes they will get.
So it was just shit burned out after the

1252
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:32,860
40th person,
50th person.

1253
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,740
But that's what people liked though.
There's something about American idol.

1254
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:40,741
We'd like really talented people,
but we also like people who are 

1255
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:40,741
delusional.
Yeah.

1256
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:45,031
And we trust me,
it took me about two weeks to get into 

1257
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:49,750
it because I told myself I am never 
going to tell some young girl can't sing

1258
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,640
that she can't say get the fuck out of 
here.

1259
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,490
Like that other guy.
You know what I don't like?

1260
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,020
Yeah.
Simon,

1261
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:01,110
I don't like your music.
Besides which it's country and I don't 

1262
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:01,110
like country.
I heard him say that.

1263
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:04,690
That seems not that super,
but that's also foolish.

1264
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,430
He's a weird case,
isn't him,

1265
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:08,170
because he's not a singer.
Well,

1266
00:59:08,171 --> 00:59:08,800
you know what,
he's.

1267
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:10,060
Whatever he is.
I said,

1268
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,520
I'm singer.
How can I say that to a girl?

1269
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:14,800
It's going to be.
There may be some days breastfeeding her

1270
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:16,540
baby and wants to sing.
Maybe she wants to.

1271
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,650
Her baby's sick and she's sitting on her
bed on the bed and wants to sing,

1272
00:59:21,651 --> 00:59:24,920
but J-lo told her she can't.
I didn't have it in me.

1273
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,930
I'd rather like.
You shouldn't have it in.

1274
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:28,820
You mean that's his Shtick,
right?

1275
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,030
His shtick is to be a mean guy.
And people liked that.

1276
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,150
They liked that mean guy shit.

1277
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,280
They would,
they would say to me,

1278
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,220
it kind of take it up a notch.
Say that,

1279
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,370
that the producers send them.
They don't want the fuck they're doing.

1280
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,060
They're the ones who,
uh,

1281
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:47,110
they got me a couple times ago the day 
they got you to turn it up and then you 

1282
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,440
feel bad about it.
Disingenuous.

1283
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:49,190
Well,
you know what I mean,

1284
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:54,191
like there will be,
it will be moments where we were in,

1285
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,490
like I said,
were some Texas.

1286
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,770
I look over and the boom started going 
like this,

1287
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:05,500
right.
And we started getting it in.

1288
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,600
They would say number one because it was
in the shot,

1289
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,140
you know,
and then so I would whip out my,

1290
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:12,950
a Limerick,
you know,

1291
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:17,951
those.
I got time for a lumberjack and stop 

1292
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:19,130
everybody when we stop,
I say something like,

1293
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,630
you know,
a metaphor from Dallas.

1294
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,120
She's a dynamite stick for a Phallus.

1295
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,720
They found her vagina in North Carolina 
and her asshole and Buckingham Palace 

1296
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,620
and the fucking,
you'd see the boom going like this,

1297
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,220
the place where it was just enough to 
bring it up.

1298
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:40,880
And we finished two more than we leave,
but it was fun like that.

1299
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,690
And it was a good payday.
So when you're asking me to have a house

1300
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,500
family.
Yeah.

1301
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,300
And I was made fun of,
for doing that.

1302
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,070
Well,
who made fun of you for doing that?

1303
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:51,320
Joe Perry didn't think it was a smart 
thing.

1304
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:55,640
He said that's one step under Ninja 
turtles and he's my bro.

1305
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:58,630
And I read that and I thought I went,
what the Fuck Joe?

1306
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:01,250
Keep in mind when I'm alone by myself,
I went,

1307
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:02,930
does he?
Right.

1308
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,710
When do I thought to myself what?
Bob Dylan do this.

1309
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:09,350
Oh yeah.
I had those thoughts were.

1310
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:14,351
I kind of fucked me up for a minute,
but then I went saw dylan doesn't have a

1311
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:15,390
house on my way,
does it?

1312
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,160
No,
I didn't have one.

1313
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:18,080
Then what?
I wanted one.

1314
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:19,900
Got a house.
He's like much,

1315
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:20,960
much money.
That guy has got.

1316
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:25,160
I'm sure he's probably got a house in 
the middle and I know I never.

1317
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,800
I see.
Bought a house on malware with the money

1318
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:29,590
from idle.
This is where we started.

1319
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,520
You have kids right now,
your youngest is what?

1320
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,470
She just turned eight.
Eight.

1321
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:34,700
Okay.
I have,

1322
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:38,750
I have my two last kids,
Chelsea and Taj.

1323
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,430
We lived in Marshfield,
Massachusetts and when it could,

1324
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:48,431
I would take them to either Disneyland 
or world or Maui.

1325
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,490
Go to the four seasons and discoverable 
right with your kids.

1326
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:58,270
But every morning I'd wake up and they 
would run to the right and go all the 

1327
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,511
way down to La perouse and I run back,
I think five miles down and five years 

1328
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:05,410
back.
How we saw this house I thought is that 

1329
01:02:05,410 --> 01:02:06,470
we're,
I need to know who lived there.

1330
01:02:06,471 --> 01:02:11,471
But I thought somebody was the lead 
singer of the grateful dead and Jerry 

1331
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:11,471
Garcia.
So I.

1332
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:15,010
Rumor was he lived there.
I kept looking at it and I just use this

1333
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,020
beautiful house.
But it was a ridiculous amount of 

1334
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:20,020
millions.
You,

1335
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,450
I don't have that,
you know,

1336
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:22,590
you don't have that when you're in a 
band,

1337
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,980
you share all the money plus management 
publishing.

1338
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,710
And then that contract was signed.
I mean,

1339
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:32,370
come on.
So you're into mma?

1340
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,740
Yeah,
we're going to slip.

1341
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:36,860
What a segway.
Right.

1342
01:02:36,861 --> 01:02:39,440
Beautiful.
So I'm looking at.

1343
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:42,380
I'm to fuck my notes.
Help me.

1344
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:46,280
I want to talk to you about aliens.
Oh really?

1345
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:47,540
Let's go with that.
And her.

1346
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:52,810
Where the fuck is.
You've got a lot of notes in front of 

1347
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,660
your mat,
but the most.

1348
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,750
I never even finished that week.
That's okay.

1349
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,950
Okay.
We can do whatever you want,

1350
01:02:57,951 --> 01:02:58,460
man.
No,

1351
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:01,320
we're good man.
This,

1352
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,470
this radio is really important.
She's giving.

1353
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:09,730
So when did you compile these?
This morning.

1354
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:12,910
Just decided that.
Yeah,

1355
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:17,000
I finished a vocal last night.
Eleven up Nuno Betancourt's house.

1356
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,940
Got to bed.
I couldn't sleep until four.

1357
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm going,
what the fuck?

1358
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:24,530
What the fuck?
Oh Man.

1359
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,320
You're sweet man.
Your sweet tooth.

1360
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,500
It's mean one format to talk truth.
Not only that,

1361
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:38,801
when people watch your show,
they know whose default the shit and 

1362
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:39,230
who's not.
I'm for sure after awhile.

1363
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,390
Yeah,
yeah,

1364
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,710
yeah.
Once you.

1365
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:47,790
But the ones that are telling the truth,
they know that too and I think you're 

1366
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,040
taking it up a whole shit load of 
notches.

1367
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:54,150
Well,
this is what you were saying about 

1368
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,010
American idol.
Like before they knew you was just the 

1369
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,041
guy behind the microphone.
You sang songs that touched people and 

1370
01:03:59,041 --> 01:03:59,041
move people.
She,

1371
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,550
she just put it right over there.
Oh,

1372
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:06,570
she wants a different stack.
But even that,

1373
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,480
like this,
having a conversation like this,

1374
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:14,510
it's a,
this is not enough of these out there or

1375
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,580
will.
There is now,

1376
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,020
you know,
now there's more of them,

1377
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,940
but,
but for the longest time,

1378
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:21,670
but you would never be able to have this
kind of conversation because of the same

1379
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:24,130
people that would tell you to turn it up
a notch on American idol.

1380
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,320
That'd be producers around.
It'd be people trying to fuck with 

1381
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:29,890
things,
adding their recognition,

1382
01:04:29,891 --> 01:04:32,200
and this is my,
the studio notes.

1383
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,110
We have notes is what we want you to do,
Steven,

1384
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,530
and then we want you to talk about this 
and stop doing that thing where you keep

1385
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:40,090
singing.
People don't want to hear that anymore,

1386
01:04:40,270 --> 01:04:41,470
but we want you to do is this

1387
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:47,310
and for you to speak your mind like you 
do your truth and have someone across 

1388
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,270
from you to speak their truth in their 
words,

1389
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:54,520
in any language they want and not be 
edited or audited is unreal.

1390
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,160
Isn't that weird though that?
That's unusual.

1391
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,900
Just think about it.
Forty years ago you couldn't.

1392
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:03,250
Couldn't say ass on the radio.
I don't know if you can now.

1393
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,760
I think you can now,
but I hear a shit hole.

1394
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:09,820
I'm on CNN.
I watch don lemon.

1395
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,130
Don Lemon.
Yeah,

1396
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,850
yeah.
One of my favorite guys,

1397
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,390
you know,
for for like three weeks,

1398
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:20,710
quoting trump news and shit hole 
countries was great.

1399
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:25,711
I went to Divi up,
well it is a new freedom in terms of 

1400
01:05:25,711 --> 01:05:29,431
that,
but I think it's because of the 

1401
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:30,601
Internet.
People are getting used to swears 

1402
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:30,601
they're going to use to people just 
speaking on edited.

1403
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,380
They're getting used to uncensored 
video.

1404
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,240
They're getting used to things.
Well,

1405
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:36,700
it's just words.
There's this uncensored behavior,

1406
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,280
right?
Is beyond his way past the word.

1407
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:44,281
Fuck sure.
The words are just representative of 

1408
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:44,560
thoughts and intent.
Just noises.

1409
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:49,180
It's like the best way to describe 
what's going on in your head is used all

1410
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:50,580
the words.
Use them all.

1411
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,390
Use the ones that are really coming out 
of your head.

1412
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,840
Don't hold them back and give me some 
watered down version of what your real 

1413
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,141
thoughts are so I have to decipher it 
and sort of put it through a filter and 

1414
01:06:01,141 --> 01:06:01,300
try to figure out what it Steven mean by
that.

1415
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:07,850
I got so angry at the way things were 
going about that I want to say six years

1416
01:06:09,311 --> 01:06:10,720
ago.
Then I quit management,

1417
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:13,180
I got my lawyer,
Dina Lapolt,

1418
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,280
equip management to management.
Well,

1419
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:17,570
I got the management that was managing 
the band right,

1420
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,860
and they're also going now,
God bless,

1421
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,570
one of them passed away.

1422
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:27,630
Rest his soul.
He was a good man and the other one 

1423
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:29,800
didn't have a lot of good things to tell
the wrong direction all the time.

1424
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,880
And now my band is with my management.
We're together a fucking game.

1425
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,300
So six years ago I would talk to people 
that go,

1426
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,350
you know what?
Fuck you.

1427
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,350
I'm going on Rogan next week and I'm 
going to fucking say your name.

1428
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,710
I mean I just built a house up in Laurel
Canyon.

1429
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:53,250
He's fucking guys.
I come home and I'd have water wall and 

1430
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:53,250
you know,
this guy,

1431
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:57,860
Lee and people would come and go and go,
don't tell fucking tire.

1432
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,140
I want to lean back so the water wall 
wouldn't rolls down,

1433
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:04,990
rolls down,
and wouldn't spray on the bridge.

1434
01:07:04,991 --> 01:07:06,760
That goes across,
not a chance.

1435
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,990
So after a year I get there and they go,
no.

1436
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:12,730
You know what I heard?
They hired him.

1437
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:14,230
Say,
fuck tyler.

1438
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,010
No,
I'm just,

1439
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,130
I'm just saying so that's the kind of 
stuff I went.

1440
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:20,590
I'm on Rogen.
You're fucking toast Powell.

1441
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,590
That manage your story is a story that 
you hear.

1442
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:28,650
I just heard it from a friend of mine.
She was telling me about her manager is 

1443
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:28,720
given a shit advice and she just dropped
them.

1444
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,320
Why is it so many people in management?
That gives shit advice like.

1445
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:32,980
Well,
because.

1446
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:38,120
Because out of 10 out of 10 of them to 
to have know the answers and they may 

1447
01:07:38,351 --> 01:07:39,370
be.
They may be right.

1448
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:44,560
Yeah.
The rest of them knew how to play the 

1449
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:44,560
game.
If you read the book,

1450
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,600
it's easy to management.
It just got to tell them what they want 

1451
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:48,600
to hear.
Yeah.

1452
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,440
Sweet.
Talk them.

1453
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,480
Well,
no,

1454
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:50,800
no,
no.

1455
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,190
It's a hard thing to be a manager's.
It's to.

1456
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,150
To manage your band.

1457
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,810
It's even harder.
The hardest thing is to know direction,

1458
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,950
to look at people's feelings,
right?

1459
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,880
Know what they're about,
why they're about what w,

1460
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,060
W,
what guy in the band should do this 

1461
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:09,060
interview,
what interviews to do,

1462
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:12,820
which ones do which ones not to do,
which ones not to do?

1463
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:17,970
Well,
don't do anyone where they're going to 

1464
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:17,970
stop it in four minutes.
You know those tonight?

1465
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,160
Show one.
Sometimes you have to.

1466
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,960
That's all they gave you.
GotTa take.

1467
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:23,910
It just seemed so fucking forced and 
fake.

1468
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,690
Weird.
Your book sell books stands for me.

1469
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:29,420
I wrote a book on how so fucking pissed 
I wrote.

1470
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:32,930
Does the noise in my head bother you?
Right to people.

1471
01:08:32,931 --> 01:08:34,700
I would say that I go,
what the Fuck's wrong with you?

1472
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:36,710
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

1473
01:08:36,711 --> 01:08:38,570
Did I write lyrics?
What did you do last night?

1474
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:43,280
The guys would give me shit for not 
writing lyrics or finishing a song.

1475
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,720
They were upset that you were writing a 
book.

1476
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,120
No,
no,

1477
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,440
no,
no,

1478
01:08:45,441 --> 01:08:45,740
no,
no.

1479
01:08:45,741 --> 01:08:47,360
Back when you're writing a song and 
being in band,

1480
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:49,640
right?
We were in a studio.

1481
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:53,090
We put the song down,
you lay the track down,

1482
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,480
and then Stevens got to go and write the
lyrics,

1483
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,940
right?
W If I don't,

1484
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,790
then next day they go,
what the fuck man?

1485
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,090
And I say,
well I'm trying to get my wife pregnant.

1486
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,190
Okay,
I have life.

1487
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:09,500
I get it.
What were you doing last night?

1488
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:12,980
You know?
But those are kind of,

1489
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,890
that's kind of shit that happens.
You get a lot of pressure on you.

1490
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:19,340
And then because they did that,
I went and wrote,

1491
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:22,160
walk this way,
the lyrics had them in my bag,

1492
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:25,670
finished the whole record,
gotten a fucking cab,

1493
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,290
went to 3:50,
one west,

1494
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:28,880
3:21
west,

1495
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:32,390
40 the record plant in New York right 
out of the cab.

1496
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,170
Went upstairs,
went,

1497
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:36,950
I got it.
And I f I fucking went white.

1498
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:39,650
I left the lurks in the camp,
the whole album.

1499
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,450
And my producer goes,
we're doing walk this way tonight.

1500
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,090
So I went upstairs,
took a pencil,

1501
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:52,210
listen to the track like I did the night
before that wrote the lyrics and wrote 

1502
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,120
them on the wall.
And that's what happened.

1503
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,130
But whoa,
but you know,

1504
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,880
no one in the band thought I,
I left the box.

1505
01:09:57,881 --> 01:10:00,230
Has got those lyrics in that cast 
somebody.

1506
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:05,570
But the.
But he thinks you fucked off the worst 

1507
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:05,570
part yet.
The band went.

1508
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:05,570
Yeah,
right.

1509
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:07,820
He left the lyrics in the cabin.
You know what?

1510
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,740
Maybe when you're stoned on coke and 
when you're still a coke,

1511
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:14,270
nothing's funny.
It's really a suck ass drug.

1512
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,730
That's why I avoided it.
Good for you.

1513
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:19,060
Thank you.
Speed could get you.

1514
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:19,240
Well.

1515
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:19,730
You know what,
I'm,

1516
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,490
I think the move to speed,
but we'll.

1517
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:27,470
Well this coffee right here.
What I'm saying.

1518
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:32,550
It's good.
I can feel it downers for me and how I 

1519
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,090
look at you.
You're shaking your head stem cell 

1520
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:37,090
shots.
Put my shoulder today.

1521
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:37,460
Uh,
come on.

1522
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,640
That's what it is because they take him 
out of here.

1523
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,950
I,
there's some new process they do.

1524
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,650
I'm in serious pain right now.
Oh Man.

1525
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,120
That's why I'm shaking.
Like watch.

1526
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,940
I could barely breathe.
I thought fuck his coffee.

1527
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,810
I'm doing it stops.
Look,

1528
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,440
if you just caught me five hours ago,
I don't believe it.

1529
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:58,370
Like a perfect.
Something like something.

1530
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:02,870
Suppose I'll be okay in a day.
What do I take for my feet?

1531
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:04,850
Get?
Yeah.

1532
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:06,590
Gabba.
Gabba.

1533
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,170
Gabba panic.
It's a great drug.

1534
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,530
It's not.
You don't get high from it,

1535
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:13,220
but it kills me.
This is to alleviate some shoulder.

1536
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,050
I have some

1537
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,770
tears.
She's work out.

1538
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,210
Yeah,
I can see.

1539
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,680
Yeah,
so she's a great.

1540
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,080
By the way,
let's go quickly back to your book.

1541
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:22,490
Yeah,
no,

1542
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,600
it isn't always in my head.
While you.

1543
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:28,850
I wrote this and I wrote you a little a 
suite that you averse.

1544
01:11:30,530 --> 01:11:35,530
We just remember the less hair I got.
The morehead you get,

1545
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:42,860
the more,
the less hair you got the morehead you 

1546
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:42,860
get.
That makes sense.

1547
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,900
Do you think love Steven Tyler Stevens.
What I say?

1548
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,360
He said Steve,
I think I said Steven Tyler,

1549
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,460
let's go back pay,
but I'm pretty sure I've never seen 

1550
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:56,100
Steve Tyler ever so I don't care,
but thank you man.

1551
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:59,070
I really appreciate that.
If you put me down in the worst way,

1552
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,160
I still love you.
I didn't do that.

1553
01:12:01,161 --> 01:12:06,161
I'm just saying because because of the 
show and because of the trails you've 

1554
01:12:06,161 --> 01:12:06,990
left in life.
I love you.

1555
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,830
I love you too,
man.

1556
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:12,831
I'm just telling you,
I've been a fan of yours since I was a 

1557
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:12,831
kid.
You're fucking monumental.

1558
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:13,110
I love you man.
Love.

1559
01:12:13,111 --> 01:12:14,810
It's getting weird.
No,

1560
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:19,890
I just fucking love your truth.
So you were telling me about this 

1561
01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:19,890
fucking shoulder shit.
Why are you so big?

1562
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:21,660
Wrestling and stuff?

1563
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:27,180
No,
I switch it up a mostly right?

1564
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:28,890
Yeah,
for that.

1565
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:32,100
No.
Are you going to martial arts?

1566
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,890
Jujitsu?
Mostly,

1567
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:40,550
but uh,
my shoulders or they've got some issues 

1568
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:43,860
from some years of abuse and tears and 
some minor arthritis.

1569
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:48,570
And this one's been.
Apparently I had some sort of separation

1570
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:52,310
on this one some time in the past and I 
didn't know it was a lot of tears.

1571
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,260
So,
uh,

1572
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,380
I've had some great success with stem 
cells.

1573
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,310
Mesenchymal,
how do you say it was?

1574
01:12:58,330 --> 01:12:59,880
Cycle.
Whatever.

1575
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:04,000
Anyway,
stem cells had that sucked out of my hip

1576
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:06,180
bone and hip bone and they put it in my 
knee.

1577
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,740
I had a knee replacement.
Oh,

1578
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:11,790
you had to replace whole thing.
You walk very well though.

1579
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,340
Well,
what was wrong with your knee?

1580
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,490
It had a 99 degree valgus.
It was like this.

1581
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:18,390
Ooh,
from.

1582
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,910
Because I had an acl reconstruction.

1583
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,960
I had both of those done.
Don't try.

1584
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:25,170
Don't believe that the doctors don't.
Nine years,

1585
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,540
nine years.
I said for someone like you,

1586
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:28,580
nine years.
No,

1587
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:32,640
no.
I've one in my left knee that's 24 years

1588
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,710
old and still working awesome kicks with
everybody.

1589
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,090
It's,
it's all about meniscus.

1590
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:44,091
It's about the amount of cushioning and 
whether or not they do a good job 

1591
01:13:44,091 --> 01:13:46,761
replacing the ligament.
But I had very good doctors on my left 

1592
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:46,980
and right knee.
Shout out to Dr Getelman.

1593
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:48,240
Wow.
Good for you man.

1594
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,580
Mine.
It didn't work.

1595
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,830
So it started going inwards or did you 
get it done?

1596
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:56,370
Forget what?
Ninety eight.

1597
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:57,480
Mm?
Yeah,

1598
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:59,090
mine was 94.
Um,

1599
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:04,160
I have a buddy 93 actually.
I have a buddy of mine who had one done 

1600
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,391
though and his knee is really fucked up 
to the point where he is about to get a 

1601
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:11,961
replacement and he actually got a hip 
replacement on one of his hips because 

1602
01:14:11,961 --> 01:14:12,040
of the damage in his

1603
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,490
knee.
Yeah.

1604
01:14:12,491 --> 01:14:17,491
Because if the knees going in,
then this is pushing that way and I 

1605
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:18,880
didn't know any of this shit.
I just.

1606
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,530
I knew I couldn't take vicodin or 
percocet one.

1607
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,260
That's how long ago did you get your 
knee replaced?

1608
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,190
Six years.
Yeah.

1609
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,890
It's rough.
Last five,

1610
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,500
six years old.
Now I got to get the right one done.

1611
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,230
So now I'm going to Europe with my love 
of loving merry band.

1612
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:38,320
I got a country album.
So you need to get your right one done.

1613
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:43,321
Yeah.
Because what's going on with the left 

1614
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:43,321
knee?
Never hurt.

1615
01:14:43,321 --> 01:14:44,050
Right?
But never.

1616
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:45,550
Never pinching.
No nerves.

1617
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:46,740
Nowhere.
No.

1618
01:14:46,741 --> 01:14:49,690
How right knee.
It's fine.

1619
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,430
Except the US.
The right side.

1620
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,310
If it pinches on the nerve,
it goes out like that.

1621
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I can't be doing that on stage.
We've seen a rolling stones going to be 

1622
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:00,000
gone.
He's fucking stone again.

1623
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,210
Look at.
Do you think they would say that?

1624
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,390
No.
I don't know.

1625
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:03,730
Pictures.
Rolling Stones.

1626
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:05,580
A bunch of different people though.
You can't really attribute it to them.

1627
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,450
No,
I'm not worried about that.

1628
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:09,940
I'm just worried about it doesn't.
Do you sure that that's the only way to.

1629
01:15:09,941 --> 01:15:12,220
Do it though,
have you talked to other doctors because

1630
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,540
what they're doing now with 
regenerative,

1631
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,850
regenerative,
regenerative,

1632
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,500
or can I say that?
Virginia regenerative.

1633
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:21,550
Why did that one stumble with 
regenerative medicine?

1634
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:25,090
They're able to replace meniscus,
cartilage,

1635
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:30,510
regrow shit you might want to hang on.
They're able to do some shit now where 

1636
01:15:30,701 --> 01:15:35,701
they can.
They can fix things they've never been 

1637
01:15:35,701 --> 01:15:37,681
able to fix before and every year it 
gets better and I'm pretty close to the 

1638
01:15:37,681 --> 01:15:38,850
cutting edge of this stuff.
Yeah.

1639
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,680
I've had a bunch of doctors on my 
podcast talk to me about it,

1640
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:46,681
particularly Dr Neil Riordan,
who does a lot of work down in Panama 

1641
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:50,920
that they can't do in the United States,
and he did a Mel Gibson and Mel Gibson's

1642
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:55,390
dad who was 92 at the time and on 
death's door in a wheelchair.

1643
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,310
Now he's a hundred and he's walking 
around.

1644
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,180
Yeah,
I know about those people down there are

1645
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:06,460
people up in the go go to Panama,
but pen and Berg is one name that did my

1646
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:11,581
knee and my knee is so fun.
You wouldn't believe it if you saw so 

1647
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:11,581
it's fine moves good.
The lefties good,

1648
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:12,950
but it's so pinches,
right?

1649
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,840
Fuck.
I mean it just goes out so I can't go on

1650
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,590
a tour with aerosmith jumping around 
like a like I do you know,

1651
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,280
if there's other.
I'm just saying this,

1652
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:24,520
I'm going to try.
I don't know how your knee is.

1653
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:26,550
I don't know what's going on with it.
You got to give me names.

1654
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,560
I will 100 percent,
but there's other options now and 

1655
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:31,840
there's.
It's one of those things where according

1656
01:16:31,841 --> 01:16:34,540
to the doctors that I've spoken to,
the longer you can hold out,

1657
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,200
the more likely you are to never need 
surgery that there,

1658
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:43,230
especially when it comes to replacements
and they're able to do a lot with hip 

1659
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,850
replacements now with Regena keen and 
stem snow's yeah,

1660
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:49,480
the longer you can wait because what 
they're able to do now is different than

1661
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:54,481
what they're going to be able to do in 
five years and in 10 years and the 

1662
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:54,481
longer you wait,
the more elite is.

1663
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:56,770
They can regenerate tissue.
Yeah.

1664
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,200
They're doing all kinds of crazy shit 
now with stem cells.

1665
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,360
Well,
now that they're in La,

1666
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:05,110
they're allowing this a guy alive that 
isn't your telomeres.

1667
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,120
Telomeres.
Yeah.

1668
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,110
That's your longevity gene.
Sure.

1669
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:13,440
And he says that people that are like 
found the Lord hire excellent people 

1670
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,760
that you conduct bands.
He's silly guys and shit.

1671
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:20,210
Silly musicians who silly,
silly,

1672
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:22,430
silly me Comedians,
right?

1673
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:26,630
People that are able to let,
let a childish side of them out,

1674
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:31,430
those little Tali tells stay longer old 
people.

1675
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,950
They grow shorter,
at least close to finding that out.

1676
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,050
So I love,
I love today.

1677
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,450
I love what's going on.
I'm going to look into this.

1678
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,460
Do,
we'll talk afterwards.

1679
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:42,260
I'll give you names,
numbers and shit to,

1680
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,390
to look up.
But.

1681
01:17:44,391 --> 01:17:46,670
So,
so I'm,

1682
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,990
I'm,
I'm a,

1683
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,230
I'm looking at it and one of the girls 
that works for me,

1684
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,780
um,
said,

1685
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,700
well that's the same thing as what 
you're into right now.

1686
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:59,690
MMA for me,
I'm a diamond may only use.

1687
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,680
It's something.
None of it's something I got into in the

1688
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,640
last year with my lawyer Dina lapolt and
it's called.

1689
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,970
I'm sick and fucking tired of getting 
beat and ripped off for the songs I 

1690
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:13,670
wrote in the seventies and where's the 
money?

1691
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:15,710
Where's the money?
It's not even a joke,

1692
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,830
right?
It's not even a joke and now that 

1693
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:23,150
there's a format that's digital,
it's even less of a joke.

1694
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:28,900
You want to fucking go break into these 
buildings and take a gun and shoot 

1695
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,871
people because they're not paying you.
You mean things like spotify and they're

1696
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:37,871
not paying you.
They're taking the money for plays of 

1697
01:18:37,871 --> 01:18:39,760
your song.
They're giving you what?

1698
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,120
First of all,
publishers,

1699
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,110
you know what?
It's all about.

1700
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,680
100 years ago,
50 years ago,

1701
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:50,740
20 years ago,
publishers take the money we make on 

1702
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:50,740
toys in the attic.

1703
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:50,740
Millions,
right?

1704
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,030
They keep that money for a year.
They put it in the bank.

1705
01:18:57,020 --> 01:19:02,020
They keep the interest right.
Then they pay you after they keep the 

1706
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:02,780
interest.
Of course,

1707
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:05,000
that's one of those members before is 
here.

1708
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:07,010
This so many things.
I can tell you.

1709
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,030
How about us,
how it finding out managers by the first

1710
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:16,031
three rows of your shows and get the 
money from the fucking promoter in their

1711
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:20,150
pocket,
brought to them in a paper bag.

1712
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,670
You want to fucking go there.
That what does.

1713
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:24,360
Is that what happened with that kind of 
shit that.

1714
01:19:24,361 --> 01:19:29,361
No,
it's kind of shit that happens in a 

1715
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:29,361
business.
So they buy the first three rows.

1716
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:30,470
Then so how simple.
That is.

1717
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:33,540
Simple.
They go up to the guy that's the eyes.

1718
01:19:33,541 --> 01:19:34,700
Assuming that the show,
right?

1719
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,890
If you have a 90 slash 10 deal,
fucking great.

1720
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:40,190
The manager goes and goes to first three
rows,

1721
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,180
see you later or you don't get 
aerosmith.

1722
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,550
Wow.
Well you don't get Bob Dylan.

1723
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:51,110
Well you don't get Jimmy Buffett and 
they're just depending upon those people

1724
01:19:51,111 --> 01:19:52,010
to not tell you.

1725
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,760
Yeah,
I mean,

1726
01:19:55,850 --> 01:19:59,360
who's going to tell you?
Because here's what happens.

1727
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:04,630
You only find that shit out afterwards 
if you're going out with a girl that 

1728
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:08,021
says,
I'm the one that brought the money back 

1729
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:08,021
to him.
Oh Shit.

1730
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:10,510
Is that how you found that?
I still have.

1731
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:13,170
I found out somebody found out that way.
The story I heard,

1732
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,210
oh,
let's keep it like that.

1733
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,880
This a story of this woman is willing to
talk about it.

1734
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,140
Oh,
but,

1735
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,820
but the deal,
here's the deal,

1736
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,850
you know,
you know,

1737
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,920
I'd love to get angry and shit about 
stuff.

1738
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,480
I love that.
I'm gonna tell you and you kidding.

1739
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,370
You know what's so funny?
I got sober,

1740
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:34,371
right?
And then when you have an anger 

1741
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:34,371
management problems giving,
once you get sober,

1742
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:34,650
I fuck you what you want.
You know what I mean?

1743
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:36,250
Here's the,
you know,

1744
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:38,340
you,
you think when you get sober,

1745
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:43,020
you're off the drugs,
your isms or wasn't bullshit all.

1746
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:46,950
You're all the reason you drank for all 
the reasons that you drank.

1747
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:48,540
They come out even more,
right?

1748
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:50,220
And then you have to manage all that and
you gotta learn.

1749
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,400
You gotta.
Learn how that's a good thing.

1750
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:53,700
We'll exercise.
Right?

1751
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:54,470
Well,
you know,

1752
01:20:54,471 --> 01:20:59,471
you just got to read certain books,
PML and you don't feel your 

1753
01:20:59,471 --> 01:20:59,471
codependency.
No more shit.

1754
01:20:59,471 --> 01:21:00,090
Shit.
You know,

1755
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:02,040
shit stuff.
Spiritual stuff.

1756
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:04,530
How to rise above your,
your,

1757
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,490
your abnormalities.
It's not so good to smack your wife when

1758
01:21:08,491 --> 01:21:10,020
you get angry.
Definitely not.

1759
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:13,260
No,
he is it you to learn how to,

1760
01:21:13,261 --> 01:21:15,720
what to how to manage that anger for 
sure.

1761
01:21:16,470 --> 01:21:19,020
While it wasn't too about.
I got sober and 88.

1762
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:22,540
So you do the math.
Um,

1763
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,550
because it had enough for those years,
right?

1764
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,340
I was out of my fucking mind.
Eighty one,

1765
01:21:26,341 --> 01:21:28,320
82 83.
So he got sober in [inaudible] 88,

1766
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,260
[inaudible] 88,
14,

1767
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,960
15 years.

1768
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,590
Then I had,
you know,

1769
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:35,580
don't want to kiss you.
Don't miss a thing.

1770
01:21:35,581 --> 01:21:39,240
Came out right.
And I'm up and I'm up in A.

1771
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,070
I know we're jumping around but disagree
show.

1772
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:42,840
He's good to use these as bites,
you know?

1773
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:45,180
Right.
Let's just talk.

1774
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:50,270
I think so man,
we went up to a place where he'd never 

1775
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,130
played.
So what I was getting to before point,

1776
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:54,540
I really want to make strongly no cell 
phones,

1777
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,460
no Mtd,
nothing.

1778
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:02,870
I used to buy these plastic stickers and
I got to go around to each guy's room 

1779
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,210
with 13,
25 comment and ask them for 20 bucks and

1780
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:11,211
we'd get 60 bucks.
I get these stickers with aerosmith on 

1781
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:12,330
it and I would put them on people's 
windshields,

1782
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:17,370
piss them the fuck off because it was 
really sticky and I put them where you 

1783
01:22:17,370 --> 01:22:18,550
throw the money when you go through a 
toll booth.

1784
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:21,980
Right?
I put them to good mood so everyone will

1785
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:22,830
say,
what's that?

1786
01:22:22,831 --> 01:22:24,120
What's that mean?
Aerosmith?

1787
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:26,280
What does this Arrow you come up with a 
name.

1788
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,790
We just sat around.
Hookers,

1789
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:33,670
shit stains,
jets,

1790
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,130
you know,
just he just,

1791
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,820
he throws shit around.
Someone said Aerosmith,

1792
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,340
Joey Kramer goes,
how about aerosmith?

1793
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,740
And I went,
the fuck does that mean he goes,

1794
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:46,000
well you.
I used to be in a band and we were.

1795
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:49,640
We were called Arrowsmith for awhile and
so there was another aerosmith before.

1796
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:54,830
Well,
it wasn't that I heard from the drummer 

1797
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:58,520
who was always bad.
It was just a really short lived club 

1798
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,990
thing as an idea.
So maybe there was a band that performed

1799
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:02,700
a couple of times called arrows.
Maybe.

1800
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:05,030
Maybe,
maybe who know me.

1801
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,610
Are they alive still?
Well,

1802
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:09,730
all I know is this.
For all the names I heard and thought,

1803
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,010
that's a good one.
I didn't see anything into it.

1804
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:17,090
Like I,
I have this knack of looking at someone 

1805
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,590
and not necessarily remembering their 
face,

1806
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,210
but,
but I feel you.

1807
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:25,210
I'm like stupid.
I had explain this.

1808
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,860
It's a vibe.
It's like,

1809
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:33,120
oh,
you don't have one of these.

1810
01:23:33,121 --> 01:23:33,690
No,
I don't.

1811
01:23:33,691 --> 01:23:34,350
Yes,
you do.

1812
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:35,520
I definitely do.
You do.

1813
01:23:35,521 --> 01:23:39,150
Now.
I definitely don't.

1814
01:23:39,151 --> 01:23:41,660
You don't have this,
you know,

1815
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:44,940
I guess I'll leave that.
I'm going to show up.

1816
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:48,660
It's your thing.
But where the fuck were we?

1817
01:23:48,661 --> 01:23:50,370
So,
so when you kind of.

1818
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:54,060
I kind of feel things I feel.
I don't remember.

1819
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:59,061
It's like Brad Pitt's got this disease.
I don't know what Brad Pitt as a 

1820
01:23:59,061 --> 01:24:03,381
disease.
He's got this thing where I can't 

1821
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:03,381
remember people.
Propofol Fabia.

1822
01:24:03,381 --> 01:24:04,650
He can't remember faces.
Is that what it is?

1823
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,230
I'm still looking.
That's a good way to tell people.

1824
01:24:07,231 --> 01:24:08,730
If you're Brad Pitt,
like,

1825
01:24:08,731 --> 01:24:09,870
I'm sorry man,
I have a disease.

1826
01:24:09,871 --> 01:24:14,871
I can't remember you because you 
probably meet so many people that are 

1827
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:15,090
like,
Brad a fucking met you 15 years ago.

1828
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:16,200
Starbucks.
You don't remember,

1829
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:17,940
dude,
I swear people come up to me and say,

1830
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:20,010
yeah,
I'm sure you remember.

1831
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

1832
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:26,331
You said I have proper.
That's fucking written down everywhere.

1833
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:28,050
Everywhere,
but right here.

1834
01:24:28,051 --> 01:24:31,170
Let's start telling people I got that 
shit pro portfolio via.

1835
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:32,780
You can look it up.
Look it up.

1836
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:35,990
It's ridiculous.
Developmental Pros.

1837
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,870
So pag,
nosy face blindness.

1838
01:24:39,871 --> 01:24:41,610
Yeah Bro.
That's what I got.

1839
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,120
Yeah,
but,

1840
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:44,220
but,
but you know,

1841
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,840
not on a large scale,
but I'm backstage and they,

1842
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:52,390
you know,
it took me like 25 years to be able to 

1843
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,390
go,
you know,

1844
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,390
I just don't remember.
Fill me in on it.

1845
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,270
You know what I mean?
It took me three years to.

1846
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:56,500
Do you know what dunbars numbers?
No.

1847
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:59,490
What does a number that you can keep of 
intimate relationships,

1848
01:24:59,491 --> 01:25:04,491
like friendships and close ties with 
people that you know in your head and 

1849
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:07,601
then somewhere around 150,
which they think is roughly about the 

1850
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:11,790
size of tribes that people lived in back
when we were developing the human.

1851
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:17,330
Your genes really take a long time to 
change and they think that we 

1852
01:25:17,330 --> 01:25:20,190
essentially have very similar genes to 
people that live roughly 10,000

1853
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:21,510
years ago,
10,000

1854
01:25:21,511 --> 01:25:23,520
years ago.
That's essentially how people live.

1855
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:25,320
They live in these small groups of 
people.

1856
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,690
One hundred and 5,200
people max.

1857
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:30,660
And that stuck in your head.
That's it.

1858
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:33,930
Then there was another million people 
here a million years ago.

1859
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,150
There was another million people.
If you don't think so,

1860
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:41,210
what do you mean you don't think there 
were people here before the last ice 

1861
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:41,210
age?
They went underground?

1862
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,950
Yeah.
That's not what you want underground,

1863
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,370
don't you think?
I don't know.

1864
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,130
The Grand Canyon goes cage shit.
Places they went underground.

1865
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:49,530
I don't know.
I think so.

1866
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,020
Well,
from just talking to and watch people,

1867
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,880
just people,
people that live 10,000

1868
01:25:53,881 --> 01:25:55,350
years ago,
we can go back to that.

1869
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:57,330
It's just the number.
There's a reason why you can't remember.

1870
01:25:57,331 --> 01:25:59,370
So many people.
You believe that.

1871
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,400
What do you believe?
Uh,

1872
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:03,920
I,
I feel feel as though

1873
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,870
there were people here a long,
long time,

1874
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:06,920
long,
long time ago.

1875
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,960
I read Graham Hancock and that stuff,
he makes a lot of sense that there's 

1876
01:26:13,041 --> 01:26:18,041
been periods of massive loss of life and
cataclysms and comments passing by.

1877
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:23,280
Yeah.
Um,

1878
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,890
I believe that we're having not watched 
unacknowledged.

1879
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,380
What is unacknowledged?
You gotTa Watch unacknowledged.

1880
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:31,580
What does that one?
Okay.

1881
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,440
You got to watch you and ignore what is 
it?

1882
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:36,950
You got to watch her and acknowledged.
Is that that Steven greer movie?

1883
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,120
No,
it is.

1884
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:38,930
Yes.
Yeah.

1885
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,620
Listen to me,
man.

1886
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:40,810
No,
no,

1887
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,590
no.
This is this.

1888
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:47,600
An industry and the industry is in 
people wanting to get mystery solved.

1889
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:51,470
The great mystery of is there life out 
there and nobody has any answers.

1890
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:54,890
I did this show for Saifai called Joe 
Rogan questions,

1891
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:56,630
everything.
And before that show,

1892
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:00,530
I was a hardcore believer in a lot of 
wonky conspiracies,

1893
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,270
like big foot and aliens.

1894
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:05,470
I just loved them because they see foot.
You don't live in big fund.

1895
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:08,110
I don't believe it's the most plausible.
He thinks so,

1896
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:09,070
yes.
Why?

1897
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,500
Because there was an animal called a 
gigantic pithy kiss that lived alongside

1898
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:15,320
human beings as recently as 100,000
years ago.

1899
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:20,321
It was a real.
Absolutely real animals and there's 

1900
01:27:20,321 --> 01:27:20,660
found fossilized bones,
these things,

1901
01:27:20,661 --> 01:27:25,661
and they found teeth from an apothecary 
shop and China there was a real animal,

1902
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:31,130
was a gigantic bipedal hominid.
There was somewhere around eight to 10 

1903
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:36,221
feet tall.
So this thing lived at the same time 

1904
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:38,921
people did.
So this is probably the reason why 

1905
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:39,950
there's this myth of big foot that at 
one point in time this was a real thing.

1906
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:41,930
And what about the.
What about the.

1907
01:27:41,950 --> 01:27:43,760
They're walking around now?
Probably not.

1908
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:45,080
I sort of.
Most likely not.

1909
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,510
That was what I was saying.
Yeah,

1910
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,060
sure it was.

1911
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:51,230
Jerry put this,
you know about aliens.

1912
01:27:51,231 --> 01:27:54,410
Tell me about the most is a business.
Most of it is.

1913
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:58,010
What about,
what about the air force general consent

1914
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,100
to Kate,
did that tape,

1915
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:03,650
gave it to his wife and said,
don't put this out until I'm dead.

1916
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:05,860
Did you not feel as though when he was 
speaking?

1917
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,570
Any of that was real.
I think you've seen that way.

1918
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,390
I think too many of you seen that.
I've seen a lot of those.

1919
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:13,280
I've seen a lot of those people is a lot
of.

1920
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:18,400
There's a lot of former military people 
that say they've seen crazy things that 

1921
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:18,400
it's entirely possible that they really 
did.

1922
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:23,350
It's entirely possible,
but it's also possible that they're 

1923
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,830
crazy.
It's possible that they love attention.

1924
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,720
It's possible that they're bored.
It's possible their schizophrenia.

1925
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:31,810
It's possible that they have memories 
that they've concocted over the years 

1926
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:35,670
and enhancements,
gotten them attention and it's putting 

1927
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:36,590
them in documentaries and it gets them 
interviews on television programs,

1928
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,870
but that there's no evidence,
you know,

1929
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:42,860
and the problem with all these peoples,
they're all have this same feeling about

1930
01:28:42,861 --> 01:28:43,910
them and then not.

1931
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:48,470
There's very few of them to come across 
as rational and objective.

1932
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:51,500
Most of them come across as there's 
something wrong.

1933
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:54,110
There's A.
There's wires that aren't connecting.

1934
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:57,080
If you talk to them about other things 
in life,

1935
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:59,270
like if you had a chance to talk to them
for a long period of time,

1936
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:02,760
sit down with them for three hours,
ask them about ghosts,

1937
01:29:02,820 --> 01:29:06,210
psychics and all kinds of other shit.
They almost all believe in that stuff.

1938
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,440
This is,
they're believers.

1939
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:10,890
They want to believe in nonsense.
I hear you as soon as that crops up,

1940
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,010
I'm out of the room,
but it's possible.

1941
01:29:13,130 --> 01:29:14,610
I mean,
not just possible.

1942
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:19,700
It's 100 percent likely that this alien 
life out there like 100 percent more 

1943
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:21,750
scared me for a second.
No,

1944
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:26,780
I think it's likely that the movie,
because it kind of had a nice thread 

1945
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:30,020
that movie's horseshit.
There's a lot of those movies that are 

1946
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:30,840
horse shit and that guy,
he knows some of that's horse shit.

1947
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:34,590
Like there's a little baby that they had
found as an aborted fetus.

1948
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:37,440
They were trying to pass that off as an 
alien baby for a long time,

1949
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,250
but they have generally,
if there were,

1950
01:29:39,251 --> 01:29:40,680
uh,
there were hybrids.

1951
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:46,580
No hybrid.
Can you tell me about the link between 

1952
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:48,960
monkeys and us?
Seriously?

1953
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:54,020
Well,
between the frontal lobes and the full 

1954
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:58,070
one monkey.
Well we are hominids mean we are 

1955
01:29:58,070 --> 01:29:58,830
primates and we're just the most 
advanced primary.

1956
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,190
The real question is how did we get to 
be so much more than that?

1957
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:02,160
I'm just,
that's why I asked you.

1958
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:07,220
Well,
it's more likely when we found fire and 

1959
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,670
our diet change and hunting,
and then the stoned ape theory,

1960
01:30:08,671 --> 01:30:13,671
which is a very fascinating theory.
The stoned ape theory is Terence 

1961
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:17,270
Mckenna's theory.
They're human beings found cell site 

1962
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:19,590
siliciden mushrooms and that through the
use of psilocybin mushrooms,

1963
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:22,890
which in low doses increases visual 
acuity,

1964
01:30:22,891 --> 01:30:27,891
produces these ecstatic states that it 
might've helped us develop language and 

1965
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:33,081
communication and creativity and that 
this term was the reason why the human 

1966
01:30:33,081 --> 01:30:34,890
brain doubled in size over a period of 2
million years,

1967
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,320
which is the greatest mystery in the 
history of the fossil record.

1968
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:42,470
They don't know why they did it,
but there's a very clear path here to a 

1969
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,680
million years ago.
Humans,

1970
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:48,360
well,
some form is some form of of primate was

1971
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,730
certainly here tons of years ago as was 
dear dear.

1972
01:30:51,731 --> 01:30:54,240
We're here millions of years ago.
There's a lot of animals.

1973
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:55,630
You mean through our peer plate?
Oh,

1974
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,380
it's okay.
I don't know if I feel that.

1975
01:30:58,410 --> 01:30:59,730
I feel like,
you know,

1976
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,280
just because there was an ice age that 
took part that took.

1977
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:03,210
It was a company,
hundreds,

1978
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:05,460
100,000
years was the ice age,

1979
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,650
well,
there's been a bunch of ice ages,

1980
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,920
but the most recent one ended somewhere 
in the neighborhood of 12,000

1981
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:12,150
years ago.
That was nothing.

1982
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,040
Nothing from beginning to end and we 
don't know what caused it.

1983
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,690
Well,
when the ice age exists,

1984
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:23,691
we have to remember that some parts of 
the world aren't experiencing the ice 

1985
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:24,350
age and then humans thrived in Africa 
during parts of the ice age.

1986
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:29,610
I mean there's,
there's a lot of human beings that live 

1987
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,241
all over the world.
The real question is where they start 

1988
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:35,061
most likely from Africa,
but they could have possibly started 

1989
01:31:35,061 --> 01:31:35,210
from some other places too and we're 
starting to learn that the people,

1990
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,380
the people that are learning.
No,

1991
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:39,630
not really.
I mean there's that too,

1992
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:44,660
but I mean mostly just people traveling,
but what you really learned from his 

1993
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,770
archeologists,
those,

1994
01:31:46,771 --> 01:31:48,600
the people you learn from and 
biologists,

1995
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:51,780
people that really understand the human 
genome,

1996
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:56,781
they really understand the differences 
between people that emerge from China 

1997
01:31:56,781 --> 01:32:01,191
versus people that emerged from western 
Europe versus people that emerged from 

1998
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:01,930
or native Americans.
I mean,

1999
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:06,010
there's so many different types of human
beings that came from different climates

2000
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:09,610
and that our bodies evolved from these 
places and there's real science to that.

2001
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:12,220
You're not going to get that from these 
goofy fucking documentaries.

2002
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:17,250
These goofy fucking documentaries are 
basically a business and the businesses 

2003
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:17,650
to.
There's a bunch of people out there that

2004
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:20,380
want to want to know the answers,
what is the truth?

2005
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:25,500
And so you get a board to secret UFO.
I saw the magnetic controller that makes

2006
01:32:25,841 --> 01:32:28,840
us travel through the cosmos and bend 
time and space.

2007
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:32,230
It's like a wormhole and they'll say a 
bunch of sciencey sound and shit,

2008
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:35,170
but there's no evidence.
Does nothing.

2009
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,820
When they talk about there's nothing.

2010
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,920
Will you let David know that guy says 
that he is the reincarnation of Edgar 

2011
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:47,630
Casey?
Do you know that?

2012
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,070
Um,
did you know that?

2013
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,470
I've heard,
you know Edgar Casey?

2014
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:51,470
Oh yeah.
Of course.

2015
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:56,500
Famous psychic who never really figured 
out anything and thought to be a fraud 

2016
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,780
most widely by scientists and kept 
drinking too much loud,

2017
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,510
loud them.
Don't you think?

2018
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:04,400
I don't know.
I don't know what everything was written

2019
01:33:04,401 --> 01:33:07,950
in.
Everybody was stone Psychedelic,

2020
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,870
second Siliciden,
mushrooms,

2021
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:15,940
opiates.
Now last hundred years you get loud,

2022
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:16,670
loud,
loud.

2023
01:33:16,671 --> 01:33:19,730
Glum allowed them.
Everyone was drinking that shit,

2024
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:22,220
but.
But look,

2025
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:25,730
there's,
you know,

2026
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,750
there's.
Yeah.

2027
01:33:26,751 --> 01:33:28,680
That shit was in that.
A Japanese there.

2028
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:33,760
They never left the island to.
A lot of Japanese have the same ice 

2029
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,370
shapes.
Yes,

2030
01:33:34,371 --> 01:33:35,840
they do.
Is there a reason?

2031
01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:41,230
Well,
there's a reason why I didn't leave the 

2032
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:41,230
island and come back after meeting with 
anybody else.

2033
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,230
So stayed on the land.
Do you think they're from alien?

2034
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,300
No,
absolutely not.

2035
01:33:44,301 --> 01:33:46,070
It's just that they stayed on that,
that,

2036
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:47,330
that,
that plot of land.

2037
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:52,331
Sure.
But when you agree to American Indians 

2038
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:53,150
from Asian look fairly similar.
Yeah,

2039
01:33:53,151 --> 01:33:55,100
I do.
There's variations in the similarities.

2040
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:57,620
It was similar,
but I think it took millions of years.

2041
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:00,030
That's my take look at.
I can't prove anything.

2042
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,400
They do believe it took millions of 
years.

2043
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:06,420
We always finished up by saying I didn't
see it right when I go out at night 

2044
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:07,130
knowing walks,
walk around,

2045
01:34:07,370 --> 01:34:09,740
I'm dying to see with Ufo.
Me Too.

2046
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:12,350
So were you every second.
I see one.

2047
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:17,870
The second right.
That will make clear shit like you know 

2048
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:24,430
the song I wrote called back when Kane 
was able way before anyways about a 

2049
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:26,750
mothership and chip way before I knew 
anything about Ufo.

2050
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:29,330
Did you ever see anything when you did 
psychedelics,

2051
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,540
when you did drugs with,
whether you did mushrooms,

2052
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:36,750
saw anything that wasn't there for sure.
Not the kind of people I'm not for kind 

2053
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:36,750
of people.

2054
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,960
People have though and the idea is that 
there are things that are out there and 

2055
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,960
neighboring dimensions that you really 
not capable of accessing them.

2056
01:34:45,170 --> 01:34:46,870
That that's where the real alien slip.
Yeah.

2057
01:34:47,730 --> 01:34:52,730
I don't know man,
but I just know that all these people 

2058
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:52,730
that are pushing it,
they're all.

2059
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,930
They all have this fuckery involved and 
all these people.

2060
01:34:54,970 --> 01:34:56,300
No,
that's a real problem.

2061
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,050
I hear you.
I hear because

2062
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:59,810
it's fun.
It's fun.

2063
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,370
You want to believe,
right?

2064
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:03,800
You want to believe that there's a 
general out there that seen a spaceship.

2065
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:05,480
It's under the mountain.
Tell me about it,

2066
01:35:05,481 --> 01:35:10,481
Mr.
General and he goes on a lecture tour 

2067
01:35:10,481 --> 01:35:12,461
and that you've got to pay money to see 
him and he's in a documentary and 

2068
01:35:12,461 --> 01:35:12,461
there's a lot of those people out there,
man,

2069
01:35:12,461 --> 01:35:14,960
and I live with it.
I was backstage with Joe Perry.

2070
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:17,990
What'd you do know my home life.
Yeah,

2071
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,650
so I get what you're saying.
The wow of the thrill of the story,

2072
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:23,390
but you know,
people love to tell stories.

2073
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:25,060
Something inside me that says,
you know what?

2074
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:28,610
They still haven't found that,
that missing link,

2075
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:33,810
that betweens if you talk to biologists,
but they do.

2076
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:37,070
They have all through Australia,
pithy fossils.

2077
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:42,190
They have the things that were like us 
that are different from a long fucking 

2078
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:42,190
time ago.

2079
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:44,390
They have those in the size of the 
brain.

2080
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,470
Yeah.
To frontal lobe brain changed.

2081
01:35:46,471 --> 01:35:49,430
It doubled over a period of 2 million 
years mean that that did happen,

2082
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:52,790
but the.
They know what we used to be.

2083
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,830
There are simple hominids that were,
or rather ancient hominids that are very

2084
01:35:57,831 --> 01:36:02,000
similar to human beings and they slowly 
became human beings and there's also.

2085
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,270
They keep finding all these different 
versions of human beings.

2086
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,140
Like,
there wasn't just human,

2087
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:10,040
there wasn't just homosapiens and of 
course there was neanderthals and.

2088
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,630
But there was that,
the one from Russia.

2089
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,730
What was that called?
That was in that mood,

2090
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,730
that book?
Um,

2091
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:19,750
Hominid what,
what is that a deal?

2092
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:22,070
Dee Dee.
And I can't remember that it starts with

2093
01:36:22,071 --> 01:36:27,071
a d,
but it's one that they've found very 

2094
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:27,071
recently,
very recently.

2095
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:28,370
You find a jamie?
Yeah.

2096
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:33,040
Here it is.
Dennis Sovan Dennis.

2097
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:38,050
So Dennis Sullivan did a Sovan hominin 
extinct species of sub or subspecies of 

2098
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,800
archaic humans.

2099
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:43,480
They found in the 19 seventies by the 
Russian paleontologists,

2100
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:49,330
Nikolai old golf.
So there's been a bunch of different 

2101
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:50,870
forms of humans were just the most 
successful form of human.

2102
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:54,350
The idea that it's just alien,
DNA connected with people.

2103
01:36:54,351 --> 01:36:56,360
It's sexy.
It sounds fun,

2104
01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:00,710
but there's no evidence here.
You isn't what we are as humans.

2105
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,020
Well,
we are mutations.

2106
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:07,370
We are an ancient thing that slowly 
figured its way out and we became better

2107
01:37:07,371 --> 01:37:09,560
at seeing things.
We've gained better at hunting.

2108
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:14,710
We became better at harnessing fire.
Freewill came from a lot of people that 

2109
01:37:15,651 --> 01:37:20,651
don't even believe it's real.
They believe they believe in 

2110
01:37:20,651 --> 01:37:20,651
determinism,
they don't.

2111
01:37:20,651 --> 01:37:20,780
Don't even believe that free will is an 
actual thing.

2112
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:25,781
I mean,
I've heard Sam Harris arguing pretty 

2113
01:37:25,781 --> 01:37:28,601
successfully,
that there is no such thing as free 

2114
01:37:28,601 --> 01:37:30,581
will,
that you are an accumulation of your 

2115
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:30,581
genetics,
your life experiences,

2116
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,090
all the things that have happened to the
people that you've come in contact with.

2117
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:37,070
That's true behavioral and that that 
four year old psychology behavior.

2118
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:42,130
Think about your behavior and how much 
of your behavior is shaped by millions 

2119
01:37:42,130 --> 01:37:44,930
of adoring fans and people screaming and
cheering you on and singing.

2120
01:37:44,931 --> 01:37:49,931
Songs that move people and literary 
changed generations give people 

2121
01:37:49,931 --> 01:37:52,940
goosebumps when they hear.
I mean all that stuff has shaped who you

2122
01:37:52,941 --> 01:37:57,941
are.
I mean all that stuff changes who a 

2123
01:37:57,941 --> 01:38:00,591
person is and who you are now and the 
way you behave now is in many ways 

2124
01:38:00,591 --> 01:38:05,061
shaped by your life experiences as much 
as as it is by your genetics and you 

2125
01:38:05,061 --> 01:38:09,981
wouldn't be this person if you hadn't 
lived that life and the decisions that 

2126
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:12,210
you make from this moment on right now.
Leave the studio and have a conversation

2127
01:38:12,211 --> 01:38:15,900
with someone who will be shaped,
at least in part by this conversation,

2128
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:17,970
and mine will be my conversation with 
you.

2129
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:22,220
This is the idea behind determinism.
I would ask what was.

2130
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:24,060
Who said this?
Who was into this many,

2131
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:26,220
many people that come up with this 
concept,

2132
01:38:26,221 --> 01:38:29,910
but I've heard it that it was really 
argued to me by Sam Harris,

2133
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:31,470
the most successful.
Wow.

2134
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:34,950
Interesting.
I just wonder why then,

2135
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,680
you know,
certain monkeys,

2136
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:39,560
certain breeds of monkeys,
smart ones,

2137
01:38:39,570 --> 01:38:41,580
Benobos.
I love them because I'm a Panola.

2138
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:47,780
Have stickers.
They'll put a stick in something and 

2139
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:47,780
pull out [inaudible],
but you know,

2140
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,320
well that's also haven't taken going.
Well wait a minute now.

2141
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,320
Then they haven't got any favorite.
We've gone past that.

2142
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:57,350
So do you know primatologists actually 
believed that chimpanzees have entered 

2143
01:38:57,350 --> 01:39:01,161
the stone age.
This is one thing that's being 

2144
01:39:01,161 --> 01:39:01,200
considered now that they've started to 
use of tools on a regular basis.

2145
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,830
They think that they're learning from 
each other and they think that they're.

2146
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:07,020
If they are evolving,
right,

2147
01:39:07,021 --> 01:39:09,270
and if human beings evolved over a 
period of millions of years,

2148
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:13,200
we are actually watching chimpanzees 
evolve in real time.

2149
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:18,490
This a long,
long process that'll take millions of 

2150
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:19,620
years,
but they have entered the stone age,

2151
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:23,970
so they think that who knows,
with a series of mutations,

2152
01:39:23,971 --> 01:39:26,250
if natural selection with a bunch of 
different things happening,

2153
01:39:26,370 --> 01:39:29,970
what a chimpanzee is today,
most likely it will be a different thing

2154
01:39:29,971 --> 01:39:31,350
and 2 million years.
Of course it will.

2155
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:36,370
Yeah,
and that totally agreeing that these 

2156
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:36,370
intelligent animals,
they're going to experiment with things.

2157
01:39:36,370 --> 01:39:40,940
Here it is.
Macaques often use stolen tools have 

2158
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:40,950
been living in the stone age for 50 
years,

2159
01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:43,950
so for 50 years these animals,
just 50.

2160
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,600
Okay.
That actually about that.

2161
01:39:45,601 --> 01:39:47,640
That's when somebody first saw them 
using the stone.

2162
01:39:47,720 --> 01:39:48,540
It true.
Well,

2163
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:53,630
in terms of primatologists behavior,
so these archeologists have uncovered 

2164
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:57,600
stone tools they believe these animals 
have used or other humans?

2165
01:39:57,680 --> 01:39:58,700
Yeah,
or other humans.

2166
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:01,140
Either your stone out right now.
When you look,

2167
01:40:01,141 --> 01:40:04,040
what do you think about when you look up
and look at?

2168
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:05,760
I don't know the answers.
That's where I got my girls.

2169
01:40:05,761 --> 01:40:10,761
Well,
I definitely don't know the answers 

2170
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:10,761
either.
Again,

2171
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:11,130
remember I just said I just repeat shit.
Smart people figure it out.

2172
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:16,310
That's all I'm doing.
What about the stones that are cut cut 

2173
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:19,190
up and not much.
You tube it up and I know what you're 

2174
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,190
talking about.
Yeah,

2175
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,960
those laser cuts.
Well,

2176
01:40:19,980 --> 01:40:21,100
not laser,
but yeah.

2177
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,660
Very precise cuts.
Yeah.

2178
01:40:22,661 --> 01:40:27,661
Yeah.
Whoever was likely advanced 

2179
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:28,710
civilizations that have been wiped out 
by cataclysm and that's what I'm saying,

2180
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:31,590
so my mind goes to fuck.
Yet we were here.

2181
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:35,160
Simply wasn't run.
There's places I saw movies of it.

2182
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:38,290
Where are you going to the mountain?
You go back three miles in the mountains

2183
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:39,840
seeing this.
Yeah.

2184
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:43,260
There's this incredible cases,
natural caves,

2185
01:40:43,710 --> 01:40:46,440
rooms like this and is a natural cave 
systems in Texas.

2186
01:40:46,441 --> 01:40:47,310
They go back miles.

2187
01:40:47,330 --> 01:40:48,600
So mountains.
So I'm just saying,

2188
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:51,060
so I should say that's where my head 
goes with this.

2189
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,130
You know,
ghosts.

2190
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:53,410
Come on.
That's your own fear.

2191
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:55,000
I don't know,
but you know what you're talking about.

2192
01:40:55,001 --> 01:40:56,220
Muscle shoals,
those,

2193
01:40:56,420 --> 01:41:01,420
the feeling in that room.
There might be a similar feeling when a 

2194
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:03,880
violent encounter happens in a house.
That might be what a ghost is,

2195
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:09,030
what a ghost is,
might be this thing that you can't 

2196
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,030
capture.
You can't put it in a box,

2197
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:12,510
can't wait on a scale,
but you get a feeling when you're in a 

2198
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:13,420
place where something horrible happened 
and you could feel it.

2199
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:18,900
It's not.
It's not impossible to imagine this is 

2200
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:21,930
the case and Rupert sheldrake was the 
guy that I told you believed that and 

2201
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:23,740
he's a scientist and some people would 
argue against it,

2202
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:27,340
but that he believes that things have 
memory and then it's impossible.

2203
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,500
It's possible that even this table has 
memory.

2204
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:31,030
All the people that are sat where you 
sat.

2205
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,520
I think it's got a vibe.
I'm not sure if this memory,

2206
01:41:33,521 --> 01:41:34,780
you know,
it's got memory water.

2207
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:38,410
Nobody knows about that border because 
it never goes anywhere.

2208
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:40,090
You can never get rid of water.
It's true.

2209
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:42,270
You can boil it steam and it goes up,
comes back down.

2210
01:41:42,290 --> 01:41:45,460
So I think when they find out the memory
one or I also got to tell you,

2211
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,020
for the billions of babies that was,
this is terrible or new,

2212
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:55,470
strangled people with their heads bashed
in murdered wars,

2213
01:41:57,610 --> 01:42:00,100
billions were there,
ghost.

2214
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:02,080
Where's that?
Where's that energy?

2215
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:05,410
Where is that energy?
Because in New York City alone,

2216
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:10,411
there were hundreds of thousands of 
people murdered that Neil's apartment 

2217
01:42:10,411 --> 01:42:14,731
building should be going like this 
because maybe it's accumulation of all 

2218
01:42:14,731 --> 01:42:14,760
experiences,
positive and negative,

2219
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:18,760
and the negative experiences are 
outweighed by the positive experiences.

2220
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,890
For the most part,
most of the time,

2221
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,160
life is pretty good.
Most of the time life is not filled with

2222
01:42:24,161 --> 01:42:29,161
war.
Life is not filled with cannibalism and 

2223
01:42:29,161 --> 01:42:29,620
murder and animals eating you most of 
the time.

2224
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:34,770
So most of the memories accumulated in 
these individual areas were probably 

2225
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:38,971
positive,
but sometimes the idea behind like 

2226
01:42:38,971 --> 01:42:41,761
haunted houses and shit like that is 
that something so extreme happened that 

2227
01:42:41,761 --> 01:42:45,100
the remanence of that experience are 
trapped in the very fiber of the room.

2228
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:49,150
I don't know if I believe it or not,
outside the realm of possibility.

2229
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:51,280
I don't either because I'll tell you who
thinks about it.

2230
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:52,720
Some human.
Yeah.

2231
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:54,000
They knew that.
Right.

2232
01:42:54,210 --> 01:42:57,010
Here's what I would test.
I would find out somewhere.

2233
01:42:57,011 --> 01:43:00,040
There's some unbelievable murder was 
taken place.

2234
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:03,250
Don't tell anybody and let 10 families 
sleep in there.

2235
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:04,370
See what I had taught at.
Duh.

2236
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,670
I'm sure they have be cool.
Go shows.

2237
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:08,700
You got more notes.
Have you are supported.

2238
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,570
I just wanted to finish that thing about
mma.

2239
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,440
I want to ask you about little tay.
It.

2240
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:17,410
Yeah,
I did that for Jamie.

2241
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:21,460
Little is a nine year old shit talker 
who flashes money and talks about her.

2242
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:24,010
Uh,
bentleys and Rolls Royces is old,

2243
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:25,030
nine years old.
It's fake.

2244
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:25,630
You know,
she's,

2245
01:43:26,020 --> 01:43:27,550
her parents talk.
So,

2246
01:43:28,650 --> 01:43:29,260
so,
but anyway,

2247
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:33,100
mma for me is a music monitors 
modernization act.

2248
01:43:34,030 --> 01:43:36,010
So about five,
about five,

2249
01:43:36,011 --> 01:43:41,011
six years ago,
Dean will uphold and I just started 

2250
01:43:41,011 --> 01:43:41,770
looking at that and she's beautiful 
blonde lawyer woman,

2251
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:43,330
great woman.
Very smart,

2252
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:48,331
very intelligent.
Speaks over here at Brandeis or 

2253
01:43:48,331 --> 01:43:48,460
somewhere.
She's my lawyer,

2254
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:52,100
was my manager for the longest time,
but she and decided to go to

2255
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,680
Washington has started flashing this 
shit around and saying,

2256
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:58,730
you know what's fair and what's not.
Wire musician is not getting paid.

2257
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:03,500
So I just thought MMA.
It's the same thing.

2258
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:06,260
Music modernization,
so I won't forget this.

2259
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:09,170
I sometimes forget it because my mom 
can't forget.

2260
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:14,680
So to attain fair market value,
royalty rates and treatment for music 

2261
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,270
creators in the digital era.
The digital,

2262
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:21,300
the digital era right now is where they 
can play my music was this digital over 

2263
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:22,250
air,
you know,

2264
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:25,640
spotify and I don't get paid that.
The artists.

2265
01:44:25,641 --> 01:44:27,410
Fuck me,
I got enough money.

2266
01:44:27,890 --> 01:44:30,730
I'm the happiest guy came along.
I got move kids.

2267
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:34,250
I go to sleep right fucking with a smile
on my face.

2268
01:44:34,460 --> 01:44:37,270
I get to do Joe Rogan.
Well,

2269
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:41,750
I'm happy you just recognize the name.
Full name aerosmith with Joe Perry.

2270
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:45,040
I'm happy as can be,
but I look at these poor folks like doe.

2271
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,140
You gotta hear this well today too.
They get,

2272
01:44:48,141 --> 01:44:53,141
they have to give up merchandise.
They have to give up a piece of their 

2273
01:44:53,141 --> 01:44:53,141
concerts.
Sales,

2274
01:44:53,141 --> 01:44:53,480
they have to give up everything.
Well,

2275
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,570
yeah,
that's,

2276
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,500
that's what's going on because there's 
no more money in actual record sale.

2277
01:44:57,530 --> 01:45:02,530
It's called 24 slash seven or some kind 
of bullshit like some crazy thing where 

2278
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,560
they have a piece of everything because 
manager see it and they want your money.

2279
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,720
Right?
Well they also realize that their avenue

2280
01:45:05,721 --> 01:45:08,990
of revenue is gone.
So then they locked onto merchandise.

2281
01:45:08,991 --> 01:45:11,870
They locked onto ticket sales,
which used to be all yours,

2282
01:45:11,871 --> 01:45:12,590
right?
Yep.

2283
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,690
Like when you used to do concerts back 
in the day,

2284
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:17,180
used to get paid for your record.
Even if you got fucked over,

2285
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:19,910
you got some money from the record,
but then you would get all the money for

2286
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:20,450
the concerts.

2287
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:21,050
Right?
But,

2288
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:24,050
but well not unless we were own 
managers.

2289
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:28,130
Ninety 10 means we take 90 percent out,
10 percent of the Mucosa there.

2290
01:45:28,131 --> 01:45:31,760
So you make $800,000.
Company gets it.

2291
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:33,200
Oh God,
that's different,

2292
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,550
right?
Isn't that a different thing?

2293
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:38,000
Well the record company gets,
gets publishing,

2294
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:43,110
you know,
with all these digital outlets of 

2295
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:43,110
course.
And then the,

2296
01:45:43,110 --> 01:45:46,240
then the record company company decides 
to give whatever is left to the artist,

2297
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,780
which is usually little to nothing.
Smokey Robinson,

2298
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,450
my dear friend,
I go up to this guy and I go,

2299
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:54,860
ah,
don't.

2300
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:01,750
But I love you seeing if that all these 
songs phenomenal.

2301
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:07,990
This fucking guy went to the digitals,
said you only $250,000

2302
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:12,400
with proof they offered.
They offered for,

2303
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,560
for the,
for his music being played while the 

2304
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:17,560
last five years.
Why do they owe him that?

2305
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:20,110
Because he was getting nothing back.
Nothing was coming to him.

2306
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:21,050
Okay.
He's gone.

2307
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:22,550
Shit.
The coffers are empty,

2308
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:24,200
you know,
it says what the fuck?

2309
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:25,770
I'm smokey Robinson,
right?

2310
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:29,720
I hear my music and his music is covered
by thousands of people.

2311
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:34,670
The guy knew legally $250,000
was owed to him.

2312
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:36,050
Okay,
okay.

2313
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:40,100
He was offered 12,000
and he said,

2314
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:43,700
if you don't like it,
suicide now smokey,

2315
01:46:44,240 --> 01:46:49,240
you don't have that kind of money.
So what we've done is the smokey 

2316
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:49,920
Robinson doesn't have that kind of 
money.

2317
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,740
So smokey Robinson should be just 
wealthy.

2318
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:56,250
Look at King.
And this is not to say he's not.

2319
01:46:56,670 --> 01:47:00,420
If he had no money at all,
he's one of the happiest guy in his wife

2320
01:47:00,421 --> 01:47:05,421
is the sweetest and maybe he's a town 
attained something that you and I don't 

2321
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:07,380
recognize yet or,
or the mass media,

2322
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:10,290
but he's got something.
He's rich.

2323
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:16,250
But when it comes to him getting paid 
actually for songs that's really fucked 

2324
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:16,250
up.

2325
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:18,150
So what did he do?
So he decided to do a,

2326
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:19,410
I don't know,
I don't know where it's going.

2327
01:47:19,411 --> 01:47:21,120
I got to talk to him.
But David Israelite,

2328
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:26,310
the president and CEO of the National 
Music Publishers Association and Dina,

2329
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,050
we went to,
went to Washington magic,

2330
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:30,030
this beautiful blonde in this fucking 
guy.

2331
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:34,250
Now we're in Washington and in me,
you know saying what's up with this?

2332
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:38,070
This money is going right out the window
and knocked to the artist.

2333
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:43,850
These new artists getting nothing.
So we decided to do something for the 

2334
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:48,621
first time songwriters will have 
representatives overseeing 

2335
01:47:48,621 --> 01:47:51,390
administration of mechanical licenses 
and administration.

2336
01:47:51,391 --> 01:47:55,290
So someone's now,
at least not only can he complained,

2337
01:47:55,291 --> 01:47:56,690
but there's someone watching that goes,
no,

2338
01:47:56,691 --> 01:47:57,060
no,
no.

2339
01:47:57,630 --> 01:48:01,480
You do in fact legally owe him $250.
Smoke.

2340
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,680
You come here,
sit down and for the first time.

2341
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,890
So this is something we're trying to get
passed in the next.

2342
01:48:08,610 --> 01:48:11,850
Don't you think it should be that?
No,

2343
01:48:11,851 --> 01:48:14,370
I do think you know,
that's the reason why we're not on that.

2344
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:16,890
We're not on spotify and the reason why 
we're not on it,

2345
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:18,990
it's because it didn't make any sense.
They were like,

2346
01:48:18,991 --> 01:48:20,820
we want to put you on what it's going to
be great for you.

2347
01:48:20,821 --> 01:48:21,360
I'm like,
how's it?

2348
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:22,170
Great.
Yeah,

2349
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,150
you guys are going to make money like 
you guys are making money.

2350
01:48:24,151 --> 01:48:29,151
You don't give us any.
It's that whole streaming thing is this 

2351
01:48:29,151 --> 01:48:30,780
weird smoke and mirrors song and dance 
they put on.

2352
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:32,280
You're going to be a part of something 
big.

2353
01:48:32,300 --> 01:48:32,640
You're like,
yeah,

2354
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:35,700
but what are you selling?
All you sell is artists work.

2355
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:38,200
You don't have anything to sell yet.
And I say to them,

2356
01:48:38,201 --> 01:48:40,260
artists get paid so little,
so little.

2357
01:48:40,261 --> 01:48:45,261
So where's the money going?
Because there's all these ain't fucking 

2358
01:48:45,261 --> 01:48:45,261
pockets.

2359
01:48:45,261 --> 01:48:47,310
Public companies and they're traded and 
they're worth millions and billions.

2360
01:48:47,311 --> 01:48:48,480
Like,
where's all that money?

2361
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:51,050
Where's it going?
What's generating it for you?

2362
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:54,120
You need to say to them,
what if I'm bigger than you are a mother

2363
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,290
fucker,
mother fucker.

2364
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:58,950
Well,
1,919.

2365
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,440
The laws were written.
Check these out in 19.

2366
01:49:01,441 --> 01:49:02,880
Oh,
nine on track.

2367
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,720
Not paid attention to until fucking 
yesterday.

2368
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:07,800
Yesterday.
I mean,

2369
01:49:07,801 --> 01:49:08,670
you know,
five,

2370
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:13,700
five reasonable.
So we're trying to get the shit of 

2371
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:13,700
organization act gains momentum and the 
Senate,

2372
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:16,410
old smokey Robinson.
Powerful yesterday.

2373
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:17,910
Yesterday.
Jesus Christ.

2374
01:49:17,911 --> 01:49:18,690
Jamie,
you're on the ball.

2375
01:49:19,530 --> 01:49:21,240
Wow.
So this is it right here.

2376
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:21,750
I mean,
you know.

2377
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:24,240
Well yeah,
there's been some fuckery.

2378
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,240
There's been some illegal fuckery and 
he,

2379
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,690
you know,
he continues.

2380
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:30,570
He created magic sky.
I said,

2381
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,700
I said to him,
what do you mean?

2382
01:49:32,701 --> 01:49:34,170
I like you,
but I love you.

2383
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:36,390
Seems that I'm always thinking of you.

2384
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:41,720
I said,
what the fuck did you come up with a 

2385
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:41,720
line like I've said to Paul,
you know,

2386
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:41,720
what was,
what was this?

2387
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:43,740
You know,
he says,

2388
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:49,070
well,
I was sent to New York to do some kind 

2389
01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:51,141
of publishing thing with and I was 
sitting in a hotel in New York right 

2390
01:49:51,141 --> 01:49:52,330
before I went in and I thought I wrote 
those lyrics.

2391
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:58,050
Somehow him being young black men with 
songs 50 years ago in New York with 

2392
01:50:02,040 --> 01:50:03,340
lawyers,
probably white,

2393
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:08,610
not just saying he was put in a 
situation where he had the magic.

2394
01:50:09,870 --> 01:50:11,560
He had the magic.
He wrote a paper,

2395
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:13,540
I don't like you.
I love you.

2396
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,990
Seems maybe the hate that he had for 
what was about to happen.

2397
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:20,230
Created the opposite.
I don't know,

2398
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:25,231
but that's what he told me.
He said I was down there and waiting to 

2399
01:50:25,231 --> 01:50:25,231
meet my lawyers and I'm.
I said that.

2400
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:26,790
Let me ask you this.
You never know when,

2401
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:31,030
when napster came along,
fucking hated that prick.

2402
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,330
Yeah,
he still might.

2403
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:34,530
You say they started stealing our songs?
Yeah.

2404
01:50:34,531 --> 01:50:36,840
Great.
Take all the albums we've ever done.

2405
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,480
Take all the albums.
Nuno,

2406
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:39,200
Betancourt,
nick,

2407
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:41,280
all the albums that fucking,
you know,

2408
01:50:41,281 --> 01:50:44,190
the rolling stones ever did put them in 
a box over there.

2409
01:50:44,760 --> 01:50:47,130
Now all my friends going to have access 
to that box.

2410
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:49,980
Anybody can do it.
It's peer to peer.

2411
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:53,100
Everyone's sharing songs and I'm sure 
people are listening to me and say,

2412
01:50:53,101 --> 01:50:54,900
what a prick.
He's fucking rich old fuck.

2413
01:50:55,380 --> 01:51:00,120
But what's happened is,
is it's become the norm.

2414
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:03,870
What's the norm is that people recognize
that you can't do that with movies.

2415
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:09,020
Right.
They recognize that if you're stealing 

2416
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:09,020
movies,
it's illegal.

2417
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:09,480
Like if you get caught with a bit torn 
account,

2418
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,970
you got a bunch of movies on there and 
you're letting people download them.

2419
01:51:11,971 --> 01:51:13,150
You can get prosecuted.
Yeah.

2420
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:17,040
Let me ask you why so much for that and 
not for somebody songs.

2421
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:18,990
Well,
there is a thing with songs too,

2422
01:51:18,991 --> 01:51:20,790
but it's just not as common.
Right.

2423
01:51:20,791 --> 01:51:24,120
Jamie is the case.
People have been sued for having tons of

2424
01:51:24,121 --> 01:51:25,050
songs.
Right?

2425
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:29,260
I for sure the movie industry has gone 
after that way.

2426
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:33,050
If you're doubling their movie.
Yeah.

2427
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:36,210
It's just songs,
for whatever reason,

2428
01:51:36,211 --> 01:51:41,211
after napster became something that 
people think that you should just be 

2429
01:51:41,211 --> 01:51:44,211
able to get for free and then we'll pass
them in the USAC and spotify and what's 

2430
01:51:44,971 --> 01:51:46,340
the other one?
Spotify.

2431
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:48,450
What's the other?
There's another one say titles.

2432
01:51:48,451 --> 01:51:53,451
Getting in Trello right now is title.
The company that Jay z owned with a few 

2433
01:51:53,451 --> 01:51:53,880
other.
They're getting charged for streaming to

2434
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:58,320
faking streams and not paying people and
all new bakery.

2435
01:51:58,650 --> 01:52:01,140
My daughter Chelsea,
she's in a band with John Foster,

2436
01:52:01,141 --> 01:52:06,141
her husband.
They put something out and it's fucking 

2437
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:06,141
ridiculous.
The Great.

2438
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:06,330
Where's the money go?
Well,

2439
01:52:06,331 --> 01:52:11,331
this is what I'm saying to you.
When napster came along and then things 

2440
01:52:11,331 --> 01:52:15,741
change.
Do you think that's when the music 

2441
01:52:15,741 --> 01:52:17,160
business really got crazy?
That's when they really say,

2442
01:52:17,161 --> 01:52:18,390
look,
we got to start.

2443
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:20,670
We're not getting money from record 
sales anymore.

2444
01:52:20,671 --> 01:52:23,010
When the record business,
they can do the shit digitally.

2445
01:52:23,130 --> 01:52:24,870
We gotta get a piece of that concert 
sales.

2446
01:52:24,990 --> 01:52:26,580
We've got to get to pick a piece of 
those tickets.

2447
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,010
We've got to get the merchant.
We've got to get everything we've got to

2448
01:52:29,011 --> 01:52:34,011
solidify and we've got to make still 
make it a big deal and the perks and the

2449
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:37,320
money grabbers from artists just 
rethink.

2450
01:52:37,470 --> 01:52:42,470
Yeah,
streaming through streaming and 

2451
01:52:42,470 --> 01:52:42,930
streaming seems like a more hostile 
version of it,

2452
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,830
but let me ask you some money.
The end of the day,

2453
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:46,490
somebody,

2454
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:51,490
executives your it goes somewhere.
You know when I watched this movie 

2455
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:55,451
called Vinyl,
you see that I haven't seen a 

2456
01:52:55,451 --> 01:52:58,610
documentary on whatever when it was out 
for a bit.

2457
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:03,770
Mick Jagger and a Martin Scorsese,
they did a pretty good job.

2458
01:53:04,610 --> 01:53:08,630
They just got too into the characters 
bring going fucking crazy and not enough

2459
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:10,700
of what was really going on.
It was a New York dolls.

2460
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:14,330
Mick Jagger song was called the squeaky 
parts.

2461
01:53:14,331 --> 01:53:19,331
There's the nasty parts and it showed 
the manager's snort and below and 

2462
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:22,070
thinking how they can fucking take this 
and that.

2463
01:53:22,071 --> 01:53:24,530
It was so easy.
All the money was coming in to them.

2464
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:27,110
They were making deals with the nasty 
parts.

2465
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:32,440
Weren't even signed to the label,
but you hear that are assigned to the 

2466
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,931
manager and the manager at a secret deal
rather than Sony.

2467
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:38,380
But you hear that about boxers have 
shitty.

2468
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,040
Can everybody,
creepy managers.

2469
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:43,550
You hear it about musicians,
comedians and everything.

2470
01:53:43,551 --> 01:53:48,551
It's,
I hope there's kids out there right now 

2471
01:53:48,551 --> 01:53:48,551
listening to this.
They're want to become lawyers and say,

2472
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:53,630
did it.
It should be the wild wild west with 

2473
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:53,630
these nasty,
completely new,

2474
01:53:53,630 --> 01:53:54,970
a new type of lawyer.
My,

2475
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:56,570
my uncle used to say,
oh really?

2476
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:57,200
You have a,
you know,

2477
01:53:57,201 --> 01:53:59,240
another way.
When I would say things to him like,

2478
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,500
you know,
what about these lawyers?

2479
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:07,460
They took on a case,
they find out after a year and a half,

2480
01:54:07,461 --> 01:54:09,470
the case is still going on.
Grand jury,

2481
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:12,540
but they find out that the guy that 
they're tech,

2482
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:14,690
they're handling really murdered the 
girl.

2483
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:21,130
He's not allowed to speak.
They're not allowed to speak because 

2484
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:21,130
that's the way we are.
Shit's got to change.

2485
01:54:21,570 --> 01:54:22,310
They,
they can,

2486
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:24,830
they can bow out,
but usually they don't.

2487
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,990
You know,
you know when,

2488
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:29,260
uh,
when Oj Simpson was,

2489
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:29,900
was,
was,

2490
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:31,860
was in a,
was caught,

2491
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:36,880
right and they chased him around and our
dear friend of aerosmith's when we got 

2492
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:37,610
sober,
we get sober and 88,

2493
01:54:37,611 --> 01:54:38,270
the whole band aid.

2494
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:43,270
We have a guy to come out with us every 
month and we'd have meetings and make 

2495
01:54:43,270 --> 01:54:44,120
sure everything was right and beautiful 
and cool.

2496
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:46,590
Or in Germany has everybody feeling girl
in the room?

2497
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:47,390
You cool?
Yeah.

2498
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,850
Everybody good?
Feeling like using fuck.

2499
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:50,900
Yeah.
Are you going to know,

2500
01:54:50,901 --> 01:54:51,650
you know,
Shit like that.

2501
01:54:51,651 --> 01:54:56,651
It's really cool guy.
He was asked to go in and see Oj toxic 

2502
01:54:56,651 --> 01:55:01,481
psychosis out of his fucking mind.
Snorted so much cocaine speed.

2503
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:04,940
Oops.
Didn't mean to do that.

2504
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,740
Hold on.
Who had toxic psychosis?

2505
01:55:06,770 --> 01:55:08,270
Oj Simpson.
He did.

2506
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:10,310
My Guy,
he's passed away since.

2507
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:14,090
Came out of there and coke and speed.
Oj Simpson.

2508
01:55:14,100 --> 01:55:15,650
You don't think he was on coke that I 
know.

2509
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:18,150
You tell me.
You tell me about.

2510
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,940
You're the one who brought it up.
It's not out there.

2511
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,360
I didn't hear that.
Did you hear him?

2512
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:26,420
Was So.
I never got that far in the document 

2513
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:26,420
that.

2514
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:26,420
Well,
I can only tell you that your hearsay.

2515
01:55:26,450 --> 01:55:27,780
Did I see in myself?
No,

2516
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:28,830
no.
Um,

2517
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:30,190
my sense,
my,

2518
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:35,200
he was,
my guy was brought in there and I'll 

2519
01:55:35,200 --> 01:55:35,270
tell you why because he was one of 
those,

2520
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:40,570
uh,
Aaa Gurus that the court system saw as 

2521
01:55:42,021 --> 01:55:46,260
somebody that if he says Joe Rogan,
he was on drugs that night.

2522
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:49,170
He didn't know what he was doing and now
the judge goes,

2523
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:54,171
okay,
let's get him into Rehab and he's not 

2524
01:55:54,171 --> 01:55:54,870
new,
but you can't do that with murder.

2525
01:55:55,200 --> 01:55:57,210
Nobody's going to buy that toxic 
psychosis.

2526
01:55:57,211 --> 01:56:01,020
You cut your wife's head off day.
He was on drugs.

2527
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:03,080
There's some kind of law.
Anyway,

2528
01:56:03,081 --> 01:56:07,610
the lawyers were looking to find someone
to say that if he was caught,

2529
01:56:07,910 --> 01:56:11,600
they never did a blood test on him.
But my dad was arrested.

2530
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,400
My guy came out,
he was in jail.

2531
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:19,060
He was fucking toxic.
Psychosis is when you do too much 

2532
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:20,240
cocaine or too much speed or too much 
anything.

2533
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:25,470
He also had a history of domestic abuse.
It was a very violent toward,

2534
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:30,490
to hit her a bunch of times and it 
could've just been that he went crazy 

2535
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:32,951
and just stabbed her,
but didn't all his friends that he was 

2536
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:35,621
doing blow all the time.
Didn't that guy that he jumped out the 

2537
01:56:35,621 --> 01:56:36,090
window so he was selling them blow.
I don't know.

2538
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:37,970
I do look it up.
I would have to.

2539
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:43,420
Anyway.
So I'm just telling you sometimes these 

2540
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:43,420
things do exist.
Yes.

2541
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:46,610
That's sad thing.
The managers.

2542
01:56:47,330 --> 01:56:48,150
Uh,
I dunno,

2543
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:49,790
I know.
I'm not sure how I got there.

2544
01:56:49,810 --> 01:56:51,910
It's okay.
What was the lawyers?

2545
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,640
The lawyers.
Fucking lawyers.

2546
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:57,380
Fucking lawyer.
So the lawyer brought in this,

2547
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:01,280
a guru as a guy that knows about drugs 
and says,

2548
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:02,930
Hey,
he was on drugs at a.

2549
01:57:03,170 --> 01:57:04,850
It kind of softens the blow of the 
murder.

2550
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:06,590
He didn't know what he's doing if he was
convicted,

2551
01:57:06,650 --> 01:57:07,550
if he was conducted.

2552
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:09,530
So you never know,
look at,

2553
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:14,560
come on.
So that was what they were going to 

2554
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:14,560
probably use on appeal.
Uh,

2555
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:14,560
yeah.
You know,

2556
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:16,400
lawyers in a sentence,
lawyers will bring in but bring them,

2557
01:57:16,401 --> 01:57:18,830
bringing them in.
So because we now trump won't say,

2558
01:57:18,890 --> 01:57:23,890
I apologize to John Mccain because if he
does doesn't everything else.

2559
01:57:24,591 --> 01:57:28,210
He said then come into light.
I don't know why you telling me that's a

2560
01:57:28,211 --> 01:57:29,060
good point.
But he didn't.

2561
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,840
He never apologizes about anybody.
Remember.

2562
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,750
So what did you say he did?
Now he's got lawyer.

2563
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:38,020
Least fucking lawyers.
They tell him don't.

2564
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:38,330
No,
no,

2565
01:57:38,331 --> 01:57:38,860
no,
no.

2566
01:57:39,310 --> 01:57:44,310
Don't apologize now because if you do,
it's going to shed light on all the 

2567
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:45,640
other shit you said about mccain.
I don't think he listens.

2568
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:47,800
I think trump does whatever the fuck he 
wants.

2569
01:57:47,801 --> 01:57:49,180
I don't think he's going to listen to 
any.

2570
01:57:49,270 --> 01:57:53,830
He's a 72 year old billionaire and I 
don't think he listens to anybody.

2571
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:55,330
I think he does whatever the fuck he 
wants.

2572
01:57:55,780 --> 01:58:00,780
That's what I think.
That's the only thing that explains his 

2573
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:00,780
tweeting and all that crazy shit that he
says all the time.

2574
01:58:01,120 --> 01:58:02,260
Perhaps.
Yeah.

2575
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,260
I mean that's just complete guessing.
No,

2576
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:06,490
I know him.
I knew him.

2577
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:11,670
Did you fuck here?
Does it feel weird that he's a 

2578
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:11,670
president?
Very.

2579
01:58:11,670 --> 01:58:12,220
He called.
Okay.

2580
01:58:15,990 --> 01:58:20,990
Amy over there worked for his wife for 
seven years and then I got her

2581
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,910
and I was in Maui sitting on my bed and 
I get a phone call it song.

2582
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:32,240
She was Jesus Christ is Donald.
She hands me the phone.

2583
01:58:32,390 --> 01:58:34,850
Did you save the Donald or just on know?
She said it's Donald.

2584
01:58:34,851 --> 01:58:36,970
She,
when we were free vodka.

2585
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:38,630
I'm just kidding.
Malaria.

2586
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,090
She worked for Melania in the family for
seven years.

2587
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:45,010
Um,
I get the phone call,

2588
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:47,220
I pick it up,
I'm sitting down and they said,

2589
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:48,880
hey donald,
because we,

2590
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:54,170
I've been down to Mar Lago and offered 
money to do shows.

2591
01:58:54,371 --> 01:58:56,470
One offs for him and just stuff I've 
been up,

2592
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:59,260
been up to his little castle.
And um,

2593
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:01,750
he calls me up and I said,
Donald,

2594
01:59:02,140 --> 01:59:06,610
you can't use dream on as for causes not
campaigns.

2595
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:10,390
And he did anyway,
he did anyway.

2596
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:15,600
And I had to sue him.
I got dino's whom send them a letter of 

2597
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:15,600
cease and desist.

2598
01:59:15,600 --> 01:59:17,530
So I've been through that shit.
So I kinda know where lawyers live.

2599
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:19,990
You don't have this whole world's run by
lawyers.

2600
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,380
And Donald's got 90 lawyers that are 
telling them what the fuck.

2601
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:25,270
Okay.
Maybe he's not listening.

2602
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,610
Right?
But when everyone is saying,

2603
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:31,300
if you just say John Mccain is a fucking
hero,

2604
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:31,960
if,
if,

2605
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:37,200
if we don't see John Mccain is a hero,
then how do you expect any young people 

2606
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:41,461
to want to ever join the armed forces?
Because for everything they do in 

2607
01:59:41,461 --> 01:59:44,971
bullets they take,
they're going to be laughed at by 

2608
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:44,971
president trump.
Right?

2609
01:59:44,971 --> 01:59:48,250
What the fuck are you saying Donald?
Well he said something crazy like,

2610
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:51,460
but you see what I'm saying?
Soldiers that don't get caught thinks he

2611
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:53,380
said but,
but they do.

2612
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:55,150
War is war.
Who wants to.

2613
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:57,010
Soldiers don't get caught because they 
want to.

2614
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:59,920
Exactly.
So I just tell you that,

2615
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:04,950
you know,
he's not saying anything because he's 

2616
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:04,950
being told what to do.

2617
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:05,570
Ah,
see,

2618
02:00:05,571 --> 02:00:07,460
I think he just does whatever the fuck 
he wants.

2619
02:00:07,461 --> 02:00:09,230
And if the lawyers tell them,
Steven says,

2620
02:00:09,231 --> 02:00:10,670
you can't play dream on.
He's like,

2621
02:00:10,671 --> 02:00:11,330
fuck him.

2622
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:12,910
He did.
He played in way.

2623
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:15,980
So I had sent them a cease and desist.
Then he sends a letter and said,

2624
02:00:15,981 --> 02:00:19,190
what,
when I'm playing kid rock or something,

2625
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:23,510
what did he found?
A better song goes,

2626
02:00:23,570 --> 02:00:25,270
I found a better song.
Actually.

2627
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,680
I went with them freely.
That's his thing.

2628
02:00:27,710 --> 02:00:30,810
You know he likes insulting people and 
you know what I see.

2629
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:33,230
I see how that,
how people get off on his.

2630
02:00:33,590 --> 02:00:37,280
What it is is I get this isn't here 
present for this time though?

2631
02:00:37,460 --> 02:00:42,460
I mean this is the time we were talking 
before the show about people trying to 

2632
02:00:42,460 --> 02:00:45,101
drag people down and social media and 
there's so much hostility and people 

2633
02:00:45,101 --> 02:00:48,970
looking to be angry and insult.
This is the time for that in a lot of 

2634
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:48,970
ways.
Unfortunately

2635
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:50,870
I wonder if he's opening something good 
pr.

2636
02:00:50,890 --> 02:00:53,960
He's opening Pandora's box for good or 
is he opening Pandora's?

2637
02:00:54,030 --> 02:00:54,880
Our choice voice.

2638
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:57,590
I think it's our choice,
but he's our president.

2639
02:00:58,520 --> 02:01:03,520
He's the president,
but I think we can respond to this bad 

2640
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:05,450
feeling that we have about those kinds 
of actions in a positive way.

2641
02:01:05,480 --> 02:01:10,480
I think that's where there's an opening.
I think the opening is for people to 

2642
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:11,060
recognize that you're not going to live 
forever.

2643
02:01:11,090 --> 02:01:13,910
You can't insult people into the grave 
and feel good when you're dying.

2644
02:01:13,911 --> 02:01:16,640
It doesn't matter like what makes you 
feel good right now.

2645
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:22,000
If something makes you feel good to 
constantly be knocking people down and 

2646
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,420
shitting on their grave that you'd 
probably a terrible person.

2647
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:26,330
Nobody wants to be a terrible person.
Least the majority of people don't.

2648
02:01:26,630 --> 02:01:31,630
So I think the majority of people are 
gonna recognize that this path is a bad 

2649
02:01:31,630 --> 02:01:35,171
one,
that it might feel good in the short 

2650
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:35,171
term to say,
fuck you,

2651
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:36,200
I'm going to make America great again.

2652
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:37,880
We're gonna fucking light the world on 
fire.

2653
02:01:37,881 --> 02:01:42,560
But I think after awhile when the tide 
goes in and the tide goes out,

2654
02:01:42,561 --> 02:01:44,540
people are gonna realize this is not the
way to go.

2655
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,520
I hope.
I hope we're going to learn.

2656
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,130
I think the world's getting better 
overall.

2657
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:54,160
I think there's terrible moments that 
have always existed throughout human 

2658
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:54,160
history,
but I think overall,

2659
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,090
if you look at the period of time we 
live in now,

2660
02:01:56,690 --> 02:01:59,180
you know,
and Steven pinker wrote a great big book

2661
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:00,920
about this and there's a lot of 
evidence.

2662
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:02,180
I read his book.
Yeah,

2663
02:02:02,181 --> 02:02:03,590
there's a lot of evidence that points to
that.

2664
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:05,680
Every now and then I'll find somebody 
on.

2665
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:07,200
I'll preach something,
see something,

2666
02:02:07,201 --> 02:02:09,590
and I call my managers,
gave me his number,

2667
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,720
called Steven up.
I'm from Boston.

2668
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:15,170
I met him and had lunch.
He's great at what he call crab,

2669
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,360
you know you know Boston?

2670
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,280
Yes.
One of the best restaurants on planet.

2671
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:24,820
The barking and crab fucking met him.
Had lunch with him and my marriage on 

2672
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:25,700
Macra.
What a fucking slamming guy.

2673
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:30,730
Yeah,
he's a really is fucking smart as can 

2674
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:30,730
be.
Friendly.

2675
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:31,060
This is the kind of people.
This is the.

2676
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:36,220
This is the.
I agree with you when it's time for 

2677
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:36,220
lifting up.
Yeah.

2678
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:39,370
Well I think that's going to happen.
Is it really natural homeowners?

2679
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,750
Well,
the more you know,

2680
02:02:40,790 --> 02:02:45,790
the more stupid shit goes on like this.
The more people are to recognize that 

2681
02:02:45,790 --> 02:02:45,860
this is not.
It's not good.

2682
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,590
Does it make people feel good and it's 
not even good for conservatives,

2683
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:52,120
but conservatives just like it because 
it's their turn now and they're turned.

2684
02:02:52,121 --> 02:02:54,470
They got a bully on their side.
Just the boat is going to kick ass.

2685
02:02:54,471 --> 02:02:56,240
It's going to fucking do things the way 
we want.

2686
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,400
Yeah,
but even they're going to realize like,

2687
02:02:58,401 --> 02:03:00,740
this isn't the way you would admire 
people.

2688
02:03:00,741 --> 02:03:02,250
This is the way to go.
There's,

2689
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:07,260
there's A.
There's a possibility to be kind and 

2690
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:07,260
conservative at the same time.
These,

2691
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:08,130
this is possible.
Yeah.

2692
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:10,970
I think things will balance out that 
well.

2693
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,350
You know,
only time will tell.

2694
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:13,050
Yeah.
Look,

2695
02:03:13,850 --> 02:03:16,370
overly optimistic at times,
so don't listen to me.

2696
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,650
No,
that's the best way to be.

2697
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:20,900
I think so.
You definitely don't want to go into the

2698
02:03:20,901 --> 02:03:21,980
whole.
That's what I'm saying.

2699
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:25,310
Don't look at the music business at 
hunter s Thompson.

2700
02:03:25,700 --> 02:03:30,020
Quote the music business.
You know when it comes to streaming,

2701
02:03:30,050 --> 02:03:30,690
you know,
you know this.

2702
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:35,810
I love this quote.
It's a cruel and shallow money trench 

2703
02:03:35,810 --> 02:03:38,530
along plastic hallway.
We're thieves and pimps run free and 

2704
02:03:38,530 --> 02:03:40,010
good men die like dogs.
There's also a negative side.

2705
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,330
I fucking hunter and I,
we were good friends for a bit.

2706
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,550
I love that guy.
Yeah.

2707
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:47,030
Yup.
I'm a giant fan.

2708
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:48,020
Yeah,
he's a menu.

2709
02:03:48,500 --> 02:03:50,060
Yeah.
Let's wrap this up right here.

2710
02:03:50,120 --> 02:03:51,560
Dude.
You're the best.

2711
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,260
I fucking hope he says we to do this 
again.

2712
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,600
I hope we opened up some doors here.
We did.

2713
02:03:56,601 --> 02:03:59,300
We had to open up some doors with me 
about Ufo and shit.

2714
02:03:59,301 --> 02:04:04,301
I'm not going to a crystal ball.
I got to rethink my ship that it's 

2715
02:04:04,301 --> 02:04:08,051
totally possible that Ufo is a real,
but be aware of people that tell you 

2716
02:04:08,051 --> 02:04:09,920
they know the truth because people want 
to know the truth.

2717
02:04:09,990 --> 02:04:12,740
So the people that come along and tell 
you I know the truth,

2718
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:15,250
too many of them are full of shit.
It's too easy.

2719
02:04:15,251 --> 02:04:18,270
It's an easy con game.
That's my thought on it.

2720
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:21,250
Steven Thailand,
motherfucker.

2721
02:04:21,251 --> 02:04:22,400
Yeah,
respect.

2722
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:28,110
Can I get A.
hmm?
