1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,900
Four three, two, one,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,940
two that didn't even get a picture
of you are going to get a picture.

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:09,420
Would you go with the Blow Torch or
the Samurai sword and found the flag?

4
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,990
What do you, um, I don't know. What does
everybody else do that mix it up. Some,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,870
some folks go blow torch. It's that Elan
Musk blowtorch. I'm going to Eli Musk.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,680
That's a good mood. Like that. You know,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
why would I want to be like
Elon Musk and I'm saying this,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,680
I don't want to be that smart. I
think that's bad for, you know,

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,980
when I was talking to him
and you know like one,

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,750
there was a moment where I said like,
what's it like being you? And he's like,

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,080
it's not easy.
Like he was,

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,380
he was like talking about
like the thoughts that are
bouncing around in his head.

13
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,310
I think his head is like a,
like a runaway train. Like,

14
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:46,410
cause his brain's just constantly
going. Well yeah, I mean but,

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,020
but to be that smart man,
you can come up with anything.

16
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:52,950
You could make anything to make things
work for you in life. Well that is true.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,840
I guess. I guess. I Dunno man.
I want a little peace and quiet.

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,370
Kinda dumb be really ignorance is bliss.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,170
You can just kick back and relax
sometimes. You know? I don't,

20
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:09,780
sometimes I just like to come home,
put the headphones on,

21
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,290
just lay back on the couch and listen to
music. Just just listen to some music.

22
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,620
I don't want to think about having
to fix the environment. Yeah,

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,250
I mean I see that too. I mean
I'm the same way. Don't get it.

24
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:24,090
I'm an introvert so like don't get me
twisted. Are you really never thought that

25
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,780
I could play the role though?
You know, I can play the role.

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,220
I mean that's all a part of like life.

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,590
Well I think you're both cause like
you're really good at being friendly and

28
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,120
like your fun guy. Like, like your
extra, you have extrovert qualities.

29
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,970
Well you need those to survive in life.
But is that what it is?

30
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:46,200
Like you prefer to be introverted? Yeah,
I prefer to be introverted. Like I like,

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,500
I love my alone quiet time
where I just sit back and chill.

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,990
But you seem to love being out and
being around people to too. Hang on.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
I love that too. Yeah, you love that
too. It's like, no, it's kind of weird,

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,630
but it's good. That's a balance. That's a
healthy thing. Well, because you know, in,

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
in order to survive in life,

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,910
you have to be out there cause you
ain't gonna make money sitting at home

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,810
listening to music. That's true. You
got to get out there and showcase.

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,610
But you enjoy it though. Yeah. Well I
mean I, I want to enjoy everything I do,

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,340
but you're really good on Dana
White's looking for a fight. Oh, you.

40
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,100
Thanks for very good at that. Yeah. I
didn't know if anybody even watch that.

41
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,880
I've watched it. We have fun on it. Yeah.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,830
It looks like it's a good time. Silly.
Nah. Yeah. Well, you know, me and Matt,

43
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,130
we have a good time. I love
Dana too, but like, you know,

44
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,440
me and Matt really have a good
time. Yeah, Matt's Hilarious.

45
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,870
And Him and Ray Longo who should
have their own reality show.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,170
And everybody was saying
that from him for year.

47
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:44,171
Like Matt and Ray are like the
best duo ever there in the corner.

48
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,820
The absolute should be one camera
that's on them all the time. Right.

49
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,500
I know the fight pass. How's that? Right.

50
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,990
They have the option to go to the corners.

51
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,780
You can listen to the
corners do you don't,

52
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:58,530
don't fight pass has some
pretty cool audio options.

53
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,010
But with Ray Longo and Matt Serra,
that's a, that's a plus. I know, I know.

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,420
I love hanging out with them like they're
so fun. They're so long. All right.

55
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:10,570
Let me know. So long. I mean the
epitome of long. I'm one of them.

56
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,160
I'm going to go up there next week and
hang out with them actually. Yeah, that's,

57
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,351
yeah.

58
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm a find it to find time cause I'm going
not for Brooklyn so I'm going to find

59
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,530
time. Oh that's right. That's right.
Yeah. Um, who do you have on their card?

60
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,040
Greg Hardy. Oh, interesting.
Yeah. Okay, cool.

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm always nervous when I say that.
I know. Yeah. Cause everybody,

62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,890
everybody's already cast judgment
for people. Don't know the story,

63
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,690
explained the story like key,

64
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,380
but he was an NFL player and
it was a very high profile,

65
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,390
high profile NFL player and something
happened. Domestic violence.

66
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,640
He had, um, allegedly, you know,
beaten up this girl and you know,

67
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,410
did some horrific, horrific
things to her. And um,

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,680
but somehow he never was convicted
of it in the case was thrown out.

69
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,680
What does he talk about it? No, no.

70
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,710
And that's the thing is that we don't
talk about it because I'm sure that's

71
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,900
something that he wants to
forget about in his life.

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,700
So I'm not going to be the
one to bring it up to him.

73
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,130
And I just know the experiences I've
had with him have all been positive.

74
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,460
Yeah, it's hard, right? Like you're not
a girl and you're not alone with them.

75
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:18,790
You don't know what happened. Yeah, that's
what I'm saying. Like I wasn't there so,

76
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,460
and I don't know how he is around,
you know, with his girls and,

77
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,330
but I just know how he is with us and how
he is with me. It's fucking hard. Right.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,390
And it's also hard because you
don't know what really happened.

79
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,160
Maybe something happened, maybe nothing
happened. Maybe a lot happened, you know,

80
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,860
maybe it's exaggerated.
Maybe it wasn't exaggerated at all.

81
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,390
They'd be lost his fucking mind. Maybe
it's just you don't. The other thing is,

82
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,610
this is something that people don't
like to discuss, but fucking Tbi, man,

83
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,760
traumatic brain injury causes people
to do terrible things. There's desks,

84
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,160
just a fact that's just no,

85
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,180
don't even know why they're doing it and
they're there. They do wild, violent,

86
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:02,170
impulsive shit. I mean we see it with
fighters. We see it with football players.

87
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,330
I don't know what's worse for you,
but I feel like football's worse.

88
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,220
Oh Man. Them guys head to head
all day long. It's way worse.

89
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,890
Way Worse.
Even boxing is worst in MMA.

90
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,140
I think football's worse
too because of the,

91
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,270
the kind of impacts when dudes are
running each other to full speed super

92
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,750
athletes, you know, 250 pound man fucking

93
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,480
renting
some of those collisions.

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,490
You Watch me just your whole body aches.
Just looking at it like Ha.

95
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,610
And they have to do that. Like, that's
what the whole thing is predicated on.

96
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,670
Like MMA. Like for me,
I'm always saying, listen,

97
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:46,540
if you get hit twice you need
to grab. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

98
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,980
And it's just a fist swinging right.
Not a whole body. Just like you said,

99
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:55,540
250 pounds. Just yeah. Even
like the hardest kick I guess.

100
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:58,820
If you get like neck kicked somebody
roundhouse kicks you in the neck.

101
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:02,700
I mean this probably
as bad but like, yeah,

102
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,130
or like wheel kicked. Like
when Edson Barboza wheel kicks
people. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

103
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,520
When he did Terry Adam Rice.
Yeah. Yeah. We'll kicks you.

104
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:15,080
That's like full rotation of your body
weight ended at one kicked oh onto your

105
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:19,040
neck. Yeah. That's pretty bad dude.
His fight with Dan Hooker. Holy Shit.

106
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,421
Holy Shit.

107
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,380
It's hooker tough cause I got tried
to keep going but his body was just,

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,520
I would his Oregon's must've
just been a nylon lated yeah,

109
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,080
cause Barbosa don't play no train
with us now too. It he, yeah,

110
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:35,790
he trained the top team now. That's
right. He went to Florida, right.

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,880
He came Moodle flood.
Why did he decide to move to Florida?

112
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:42,380
Is Moitai coach was in Florida.
We, cause he was with Mark Henry,

113
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,070
Mark Henry. But it's Moitai
coaches, the guy who brought them,

114
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,080
who taught him everything from a kid.

115
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,580
And I know we reached out to his Muay
Thai coach to come down and work with our

116
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,640
team and you know, cause I think
he was in Brazil, whatever.

117
00:06:55,641 --> 00:07:00,530
So he came with our team and then Edson
just followed him. Wow. Yeah. That bond.

118
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,400
Yeah. Well I'm telling you man,
he looks fucking good. I know.

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,700
I mean he's an amazing athlete.
He's so fast.

120
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,560
His switch kick is probably the
fastest I've ever seen. Yeah.

121
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,380
I don't think I've ever seen anybody
throw a switch kicked off fast. Yeah.

122
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,320
I remember watching a
switch kick and I was like,

123
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,930
it's like someone took a frame out
of it. Yeah. You know what I mean?

124
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:22,460
Like a Bruce Lee movie. And not
only that, but he does like,

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
he's got a pretty high level of
intelligence in terms of fighting.

126
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,900
He makes that stuff work. Yeah. You
know, I mean, and I, I look at this like,

127
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,850
cause I've worked with, uh, with
mark the Khasi in case. Yeah.

128
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,160
Physically.
I mean just God given abilities,

129
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,050
but he just doesn't have the intelligence
to like make all that shit work.

130
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,860
He's screaming at the TV right
now. I know. I know. And I say that

131
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,810
and I, and I say that with all due
respect because he's my main guy.

132
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,970
Isn't he a young guy? Yeah. He's,
I mean early to mid twenties. Yeah.

133
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,540
Maybe he's just trying to figure it
out. Yeah. And that's what it is.

134
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,540
He's trying to figure it out and it
kind of pushed him a little fast.

135
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,560
So he didn't even have a,
you know,

136
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:04,870
a lot of time and have some Edsons
had some ups and downs, you know,

137
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,310
cowboy fight was a big down,
I mean,

138
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:11,240
he's had a fight that was a big down.
Oh yeah,

139
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,130
that was terrifying. Fight doesn't even
realize how goddamn good could be. Oh,

140
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:19,580
I know. That was like, that's the fight
that I put [inaudible] on the map.

141
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:23,660
Really for everybody to say, Matt, who's
going to beat this guy? He did to him.

142
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,300
Who's going to beat this guy.
Yeah.

143
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,320
But that's what I've always said is that
like if you had to pick like one thing

144
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,390
that you're good at,
like what's the most important thing?

145
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:36,140
It seems to me to be wrestling
because the wrestlers can just,

146
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,460
if you get a like a real high level
wrestler, they just dictate what happens.

147
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,830
They dictate where the fight takes place.
I don't think there is,

148
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,190
I mean you have to know how to strike.
You have to know the other things as well.

149
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,910
But I feel like if you have a
pyramid of shit that's important,

150
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,980
it feels like at the bottom is wrestling
and that motherfucker wrestles better

151
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,480
than anybody in that division. Yeah. I
mean, but see, I disagree kind of. Okay.

152
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,780
And here's why. Um, I don't necessarily,
because when we talk about wrestling,

153
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,030
I don't think it's necessarily
the techniques of restaurant.

154
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,090
I think it's just a waiter are brought
up dope, brought up different Stan.

155
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,130
Not only he,
they're definitely brought up differently,

156
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,740
but like any wrestlers just brought
up different, oh, toughness.

157
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,610
A different level of
toughness, a different level,
a level of competitiveness.

158
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,060
So like when you go to a Jujitsu school
was first thing you learn how to do his

159
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,000
bowel to Matt and kiss the
instructors ass. That's it.

160
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,790
You know you bout a mat and then you're
learning self defense and you learn to

161
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:33,120
respect and wrestling. It's not
about that, it's about dominating.

162
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,920
It's about winning,
dominating.

163
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:40,200
So there they have years of experience
of doing that. Like just that mindset.

164
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,530
It's also about being uncomfortable all
the time and it's like it or just the

165
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:47,340
room is always rough. It's always
tough. Like you go to a Jujitsu school,

166
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,710
it's a bunch of dudes smoking pot,
land back.

167
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,070
They roll five minutes, sit
back, smoked for 30 role.

168
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:57,090
Another five minutes you go to
a wrestling room is hot, sweaty,

169
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,310
they're all uncomfortable or all grinding.

170
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,480
So you take that guy and you
teach them some basic Jujitsu.

171
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,990
You got a champ. Yeah.
This is the mindset for me.

172
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,370
Physical strength to Aa, they got
physical strength. The grip strength.

173
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:14,370
I guess so important. Like for me like
grips is everything. And in wrestling,

174
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,600
you learned a lot of that early.

175
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,400
So I feel like that's kind of the
different searches brought up different.

176
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,440
Yeah, I definitely think
there's something to that.

177
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:26,750
And then also being able to cut weight
and still compete. Yeah, I mean,

178
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,410
so I'm always telling my fighters now,

179
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,210
like when you have that
restaurant experience,

180
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:32,010
especially if you wrestled in college,

181
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,840
like you go all your high school years,
you got 50 matches a year,

182
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,320
so you competing 200 times before you
even graduate high school and then you go

183
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:43,980
to college.
If he wrestled in college,

184
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,880
you compete against the best of the best
in the best room and then you fight MMA

185
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,960
is nothing.
It's nothing to you and now you,

186
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,720
and then you take a kid off the
street who's never competed before,

187
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,040
they're nervous,

188
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,880
they don't perform well there always
at a disadvantage and as somebody who

189
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,660
wrestled, right, because of the
experience in competition. Yeah. Yeah.

190
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,900
That makes sense. The only thing about
with some wrestlers, because of the,

191
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,870
there's like a tightness to wrestling
and some wrestlers just never learned how

192
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:17,160
to be loose with Ca. And some, some
pick it up quick. It's weird. What else?

193
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,650
The difference. And that's what makes
some of them better than the other ones.

194
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,480
When I look at, you know, obviously
Tyron Woodley, he's got it. He's loose.

195
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,920
He's got it. Yeah. Michael Chandler, when
he throw his right hand, it's loose. Yeah.

196
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,770
Yeah. Uh, but you're right.
Some of them just can't get it.

197
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,820
And that's why they struggle.

198
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,100
And they struggle if they fight a wrestler
who can strike. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:42,030
It's terrifying for a wrestler who
can't strike to fight a wrestler who can

200
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:45,240
strike is terrifying. Oh
yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

201
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,020
Some dude who can keep it standing
and can fuck you up special.

202
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,190
They can kick too. I know. I know.

203
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,110
But I think that's another
problem with wrestlers.

204
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:56,320
They fall in love with striking
early. Yes. Jujitsu guys
too. Yeah. Yeah. And that's,

205
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:58,470
and that's, and, and that's
what messes them up, man.

206
00:11:58,471 --> 00:12:01,360
He Fall in love with it and think,
oh, I have to be well rounded,

207
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,270
so I have to dedicate all my time
to doing this. I'm like, man,

208
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,740
but you getting worse.
It what you're good at.

209
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,230
Why I used to watch the George
group Shell fight. I'm like,

210
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:09,270
if you watch that guy fight,

211
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,810
you never know that he was a Brazilian
jujitsu black belt. Oh come man.

212
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,280
I used to get so mad at him.
I'm like, dude, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

213
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,420
Like he,
yeah,

214
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,780
I don't know if it was like
fan expectation or just
like in his mind he wanted

215
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:29,140
to be a striker, but I'd
be like, dude, what are you
doing? I think he liked it too.

216
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,350
And you think there's something to
that too? Something that they like?

217
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,650
I don't know. It gets weird when they
have that new tool. Yeah, I mean,

218
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,820
but it's ruined a lot of good fighters.
Careers.

219
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:44,260
I mean you look at Johnny Hendricks.
Yup. Or Josh Koscheck. They, Josh,

220
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,580
he fell in love with that right hand.

221
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,550
Hendrick's fell in love with that left
hand and then when it caught up to him,

222
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,730
Hendrick's is an interesting case
cause something switched off.

223
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,650
Something,
something changed with dark.

224
00:12:56,651 --> 00:13:01,570
I like that guy used to knock everybody
dead and then it just stopped happening.

225
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,910
Like you watch his Martin Kampmann fight.

226
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,810
Mark Cameron went flying like
he had the death touch. Yeah.

227
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,340
John Fitch went flying like the death
touch. Yeah. Like he was some mash.

228
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,570
I mean he caught him early. Boom. Yeah,
they were flying. Yeah. Like if you,

229
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,420
if he touched you,

230
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:19,840
you are getting fucked up like something
happen and then all of a sudden

231
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,900
everybody surviving. Yeah.
I'm not sure. I'm honestly,

232
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:26,860
I'd have to look back and watch,
but um, I don't really know man.

233
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:29,860
He started throwing a lot of leg kicks
and just like taking a little bit of

234
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:33,730
steam off his shots, off his punches. I
don't really know. It could be injuries.

235
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Like sometimes you see a guy, they as
they get older or they get injured,

236
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,120
they just, they don't throw
the punch the same way anymore.

237
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,890
It's almost like they can't throw it
straight. It's like they're kind of Yay.

238
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,030
Shoulders are fucked up. Their mechanics
are off. He handed it mechanics change.

239
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,350
You see that with our Lawsky
when our Alaska was young dude,

240
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:57,280
his right hand was up fucking piston.
Oh Man. He was great, wasn't he? Yeah.

241
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:59,050
Have you ever watched his
fight with Paul Blend Tello?

242
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,210
It's been a while since I've seen that.

243
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:05,110
But it's like the perfect
example of an ar Lawsky knockout.

244
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,100
He Kl Paul Bentel with a straight
right hand. It was just black.

245
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,750
It just came knocking off the shoulder
and it doesn't come off the shoulder

246
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,580
anymore. Now it's like it comes up almost.
Yeah. Like is he doesn't, he can't,

247
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,590
he doesn't throw it straight anymore.
It doesn't,

248
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,750
it doesn't seem the
same when he throws it.

249
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,090
Well I see him in the gym all the time.
He changed with us too.

250
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,830
So I see him in the gym all the time.
And,

251
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,460
and I mean obviously it's kind
of sad because you see them,

252
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,090
it's like you remember how great he
was and now like with age and injuries,

253
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:34,540
you know,

254
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,900
he's just trying to get through a
workout and that's not a knock on him.

255
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:41,290
It's just, it just happens when you get
older. He's 40 yeah. You're 40 years old.

256
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,020
So like your workouts are different.
Well it's also,

257
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,030
he's 40 years old with 15 plus
years of world class combat.

258
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,190
Yeah. I mean, if you look at some of
the knockouts that he suffered against,

259
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,630
like Sergei Keratan off against
Francis and gone. No, I mean he's,

260
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,410
he suffered some brutal fucking
knockouts. Oh, I know. I mean,

261
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:04,160
but just the fact that here's
our Lawsky this is, this is like,

262
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,560
I want to say he's like UFC
fucking 37 or some shit.

263
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,480
Boom. Look at that. Oh yeah. That was
straight down the pipe. Show that again,

264
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,200
real quick. This boom. I mean,

265
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,520
just the timing precision.

266
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,540
He was a fucking savage
back then. Yeah, that was,

267
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,360
you couldn't really do
it better than I am.

268
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,510
He was the scariest fucking
heavyweight on the planet for a while.

269
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,220
I made and he had a,
you know,

270
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:37,640
you gotta respect his career because he's
done a lot and he's still good. Yeah.

271
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:42,470
Yeah. And he's still good. He's still,
yeah. I mean, he loves to fight.

272
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:45,450
He still, he still fights
with enthusiastic. Yeah.

273
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,940
He just can't get his body to do
what it used to do in the gym.

274
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,160
Like it took him a while for
them to kind of lighten up a bit.

275
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:54,640
I remember he'd come in the gym, you
know, he's, you know, he's got that,

276
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:55,474
that Russian,

277
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,480
that scary Russian look to him and he'd
come in a jam and wouldn't say nothing

278
00:15:59,481 --> 00:16:02,660
to nobody. But now he's
now he smiles. Smile.

279
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,430
It's hard to get these
guys to smile sometimes.

280
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,440
So as he down in Florida
now he's down to Florida.

281
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,040
When did he start going down there?
It's been like two fights, right? Yeah.

282
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,350
Maybe a little more than that.
He works a lot with Mike Brown and uh,

283
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,250
and they've been working together for
maybe long, maybe two years maybe.

284
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:18,080
So here's a Jackson's for quite a bit.
Yeah.

285
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,910
And then he just decided to just keep
moving. That's the life of a room.

286
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,420
Fucking rambling fighter.

287
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,120
Moving different towns and trying to
simulate, man, it's so hard. Single,

288
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:33,140
no kids yet. But they ended up doing it.

289
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,560
They get in girls and like they ended
up shacking up with a girl because it's

290
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:40,800
easier for him. And in
what way? Like when you,

291
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,280
you are struggling to fight or you
got nothing, hardly nowhere to live.

292
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,510
You find a girl and you shack up with
her and she'd pay all your bills.

293
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,650
Oh really? And that's what a lot
of fighters ended up going on.

294
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,270
That's why you see him end up like,
would they grow a young paying the bills?

295
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,090
That's never a good relationship.
Now girls paying the bills. No.

296
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,410
Especially when you're a fighter
and then you lose a fight.

297
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,960
She looking at you like this
mother fucking job, get a job,

298
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,500
get a job.
You got brain damage.

299
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,700
He's still eh,
yeah.

300
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,963
Yeah.
It's a,

301
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,320
it's a weird road when it's a weird road
when you don't think that you could win

302
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,460
a title.
Right.

303
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,550
Like every fighter wants to think that
they can one day be like a title holder

304
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:30,900
or be one of the elite of the
elite. Yeah. And then the hunt,

305
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,390
it starts out like that. It
starts out like that. Yeah.

306
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,570
It don't always end up like that
though. Yeah. But that's the weird,

307
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,270
the weird world is the world of the
journeyman. Like when a Touro God,

308
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,140
he used to fight Micky
Ward and we both knew,

309
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,290
everybody knew that these guys were
not going to win any titles. But yeah,

310
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,980
but you still wanted to
see them the fuck out of

311
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,920
each other. Still want to see
them go to war. Well, I mean,

312
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:56,880
but that's where we got to kind of draw
that line between like sport and event.

313
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,050
Right? Yeah. You know,

314
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:03,051
because like when we and fighters have
to also be real with themselves to is are

315
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,320
you doing this for the sport?

316
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,030
You chomp be a champ or are you just
trying to be a fan favorite and you should

317
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,760
train the way you want it on what
you want to project to the world.

318
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,770
And a lot of fighters don't do that well,

319
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,080
but if you're trying to be a fan favorite,

320
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,070
like if you're a guy who
just wants to bang it out,

321
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,460
like how many of those you got it in
you. It's not many, but some, you know,

322
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,610
Donald's Serone, you know,
he's, that's his robe now. Yeah.

323
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,760
In a way. But I think Donald's
still thinks he can win a title

324
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,200
as tough. Now. It's going to
be tough for him. Well, they
were trying to get him, um,

325
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,680
he was trying to get the Conor McGregor
fight. That had been a tough fight. Fam.

326
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,300
It would've been a tough fight for him.

327
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:46,620
But at 155 pounds is not a bad
fight for him. No, not really.

328
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,400
But I mean, the problem is
stylistically, he just does,

329
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,850
he doesn't move his head enough.
Yeah. You know, and Nate, I mean,

330
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:58,200
Nate doesn't either, but Nate took a lot
of shots, you know, to the hit. So I mean,

331
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,520
it's kind of a bad, I don't
know. Yeah. But Nate, Nate is a,

332
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,230
Nate is a very good boxer.
Yeah. Make a box. Nate Diaz is,

333
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,340
it frustrates the shit out of me
that he's not fighting. Why is that?

334
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,680
Because I like to see him.
I want to see him get in there.

335
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:15,450
I want to see him make
money while he can too.

336
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,690
I mean you're only going to be able
to live this lifestyle for, I mean,

337
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,880
I know he made a couple of million
dollars off of the Conor fight,

338
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,290
but he hasn't fought in two years
more than handling anything else.

339
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,380
Like put the dust employee a
fight that was going to happen,

340
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:29,580
but then [inaudible] got injured,

341
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,400
he's got some hip issue and then he
pulled out of that fight. I just,

342
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,070
I was looking forward to that
fight. I want to, I want to
see him back in it. Yeah.

343
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:41,640
But I mean I would have loved to seen
that fight and then never supposed to find

344
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:46,230
Mazda doll. That's, that's not
going to happen. Oh, why? I Dunno.

345
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,660
That's the perfect fight.
Great fight. The fight.

346
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:52,620
Where you going to got like the Hispanic
culture, the civil war and that's fine.

347
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:57,120
Yola going at it. Yeah. That
would have been a great stylistic,

348
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,520
they would have talked trash to each
other. It would have been crazy.

349
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,440
Whoever dropped the ball
on that needs to be fired.

350
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,930
I think nick just decided not fight. I
don't know. I do not know. I don't know.

351
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,180
I'm talking out of my ass.
I don't know the specifics,

352
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,110
but I was looking forward to it.
But then I saw an article that said Nate,

353
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,360
Nick Diaz confirms he's not going to
be fight in the UFC two 35 I'm like,

354
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,450
ah, what? What? Get in there.

355
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,920
Oh, come on man. Last time we fought
was Anderson Silva. That's crazy.

356
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,250
That is crazy. That's crazy. But I
don't know. I mean, I don't know Joe.

357
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,720
And this is something that we
kind of kind of stopped doing man.

358
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:39,480
Like maybe they ain't got it no more.
Well I don't know if it's,

359
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:42,030
he doesn't have it anymore because
we haven't seen him not have it.

360
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,210
He fought well against Anderson
and Anderson is 185 pounder.

361
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,130
I wouldn't lead down. Yay. Yeah, I mean,

362
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,563
I mean,

363
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,560
I mean honestly if anybody could still
fight in their older age to weigh those

364
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:58,120
two Diaz brothers fight their style
will allow them to fight longer cause

365
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:02,860
they're not like the best athletes.
City rely on skill and just endurance.

366
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,780
Endurance. Yeah. So they can fight longer.

367
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:09,640
So I'm assuming that they
still have something left in
the tank. I'm sure. I mean,

368
00:21:09,641 --> 00:21:12,290
they're obviously not out of
shape. They're both things. Yeah,

369
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,400
they look like their fit.
I see them training,

370
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,510
I see pictures of them with Jujitsu
gies on and hitting the bag and shit.

371
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,780
This is, you know, who knows man.

372
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,830
I mean it's also like they want that
big pay day, you know? Especially now,

373
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:30,220
and they should get that big payday.
But goddamn, if I was the UFC,

374
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,450
if I am fuck yeah,
I think those guys are superstars.

375
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,800
I think the UFC doesn't know.

376
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,000
I think one of the reasons why Nate
Diaz versus Conor McGregor was so big is

377
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:44,330
because people love Nate Diaz too.
Yeah, yeah. Conor Mcgregor, no doubt.

378
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,990
Conor Mcgregor,
no disrespect to Eddie Alvarez,

379
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,060
but when Conor McGregor
fight Eddie Alvarez,

380
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,570
the vast majority of the
eyes were on Conor McGregor.

381
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,470
When Conor McGregor fights Nate Diaz,
you,

382
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,120
you're looking at a lot of
people who love Nate Diaz. Yeah.

383
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,580
But how do you think that happened?
Like,

384
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:02,620
how do you think Nate got
that says that star power.

385
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,910
You think he legitimately doesn't give
a fuck? He smokes weed all the time.

386
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,810
People love it. They love the fact
that those guys are like that. No Man,

387
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:14,590
but what does that say about our
fan base and our society? Well,

388
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,430
I don't know.
You know what does,

389
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,880
here's what's disappointing to
me that for whatever reason,

390
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,920
mighty mouse never became
a giant superstar. Yeah.

391
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,970
That confused the shit out of me.
I'd watch that guy fight,

392
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,600
you know when he took Ray Borg and suplex
him and caught him with an arm bar on

393
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,530
the way down and was like,

394
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:36,820
what the fuck does this guy have
to do to become a superstar?

395
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,550
I mean his skill levels
off the chart for sure.

396
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,330
It doesn't get hit for sure and put it
on it. He's a dazzling fighter. Puts,

397
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:45,160
puts on show skill for skill.

398
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,550
There's nobody on the planet who can do
what he does now. He's the best ever.

399
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,770
He's the best physically ever.
Yeah.

400
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,120
When the only thing that keeps him from
being thought of as universally the

401
00:22:55,121 --> 00:23:00,121
greatest of all time is Jon Jones and
Jon Jones has been able to beat better

402
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:05,710
guys like John Jones, fight fights
a better caliber of competition.

403
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,980
Cause the 205 pound weight class
at least at one point in time,

404
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,040
had a deeper talent pool. Yeah,
but do you think of this? Ah,

405
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,840
yeah. I mean, I'm going to agree
with you there, but I will say this,

406
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,340
I think that sometimes we confuse
popularity. Actual talent.

407
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,570
Well,

408
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,570
I say yes and no because if you think
about like Daniel Cormier ne Daniel called

409
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:33,010
me twice day. Humble for sure.
Rumbles this rumble. Yes.

410
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,860
Knockout artist in the history
of that division. Okay.

411
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,750
Nobody Merck's people like rumble.
No Kid. Fuck that guy hits hard.

412
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,450
I know Jesus Christ. He's one of the
scariest, I would not want to mess it.

413
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,010
Piss him off.
I wouldn't want to piss him

414
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,380
off. Yeah. Fuck yeah. I see
him in Florida. I want some.
I'm always like, hey, yeah.

415
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,220
Hey, how you doing buddy? You good?
Can I get you anything? Stayed tight

416
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,240
as a scary motherfucker.
Rumble. Beat him twice.

417
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,600
Think about that and think of what he
did to Gustafson and what he does to

418
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:05,270
everybody. What he did. I mean, fuck man,

419
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,290
he did a little nog or whoa.

420
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,050
He just smashes people. Yeah,
yeah. I mean, you're right.
I mean, Jon Jones. Yeah,

421
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,270
you're right. John Doe the beat
a better caliber guys easily.

422
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,300
And he did it easily. I, I was
really looking forward to that fight.

423
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,050
John Jones versus rumble. Very. I
was looking forward to that fight.

424
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,430
I wish that fight took place,

425
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,100
but for whatever reason rumble couldn't
beat the best of the best. You know,

426
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,820
it's unfortunate, you know, I think,
I mean, he and he wrestled too,

427
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:38,720
so I don't know really know what is
performance anxiety was based on,

428
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,440
but he had it. But you know what, for
some reason he said after he retired,

429
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,780
you know, in the fight with when he lost
a DC, he goes, I'm just good at this.

430
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,200
He goes, I'm not really a fighter.
He's like, I'm an athlete. He goes,

431
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:54,140
I'm just real good at this. Yeah. Like,
how the fuck are you not a fighter?

432
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,430
You smash people.
I mean he's a terrifying fighter,

433
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,090
but he just does not his thing.
But that's the thing, Joe and I,

434
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:02,750
and I had to tell you,
cause when I'm coaching guys,

435
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:07,400
I have to identify that early and what
I'm working with. Are you a fighter?

436
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,400
You are an athlete, right? You're a
competitor or are you artists? Right.

437
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,290
I put them in four categories and they
have to be trained all differently.

438
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,820
If you had to train an artist, artists,
you got to let them get creative.

439
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,460
Like give me an example of
artists like uh, as a fighter,

440
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,930
I look at somebody like prime example,
we just saw them. Ryan Hall. Yes.

441
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,950
Ryan Hall is, and artists would, he
did that was like art. That's poetry.

442
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,720
What he did to Bj and fight the fight
world ain't really ready for that yet.

443
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,440
You don't think so? No. It's getting
there. But they're not ready for that yet.

444
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:41,840
Because when you saw him,
when he fought a gray Maynard,

445
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,760
he's trying to perform his
art gray. Maynard wouldn't
let him. So who do we blame?

446
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,440
We blame the artists. Everybody said all
bad Ryan Hall and kick them out of here.

447
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,340
He's a pussy.
He can't fight the smart way for sure.

448
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:58,130
He Maynard hits hard for sure.
So he fought him. He dove
for his legs. 15 minutes.

449
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:01,820
But when it works, we can
appreciate the art. Yeah,

450
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,000
we'll just gray Maynard was
prepared and he shrugged them off.

451
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,730
Here's an example of
an artist style bender.

452
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,200
Stop and artists or artists or
artists. Pure artists. Yeah.

453
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,860
Anderson Silva artists.
Artists. Like these guys are
artists and they can't treat,

454
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:19,940
you can't train them the same way you
train like a fighter or Natalie. Yeah.

455
00:26:19,941 --> 00:26:20,920
You can't train on my deck.

456
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,950
Perry's a app and I know Mike Perry since
the first day he walked into a gym and

457
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,570
he's always had like does edge on
him and this chip on his shoulder.

458
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,690
I think he'd make it this far to be honest
with you. I thought he'd be in jail.

459
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,650
I swear to God. Wow. Yeah.
Wow. What made you think that?

460
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,190
Just says he had like,
he had a little chip on his shoulder.

461
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,560
He was always getting in trouble, getting
arrested, getting in trouble. But um,

462
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,160
I'm proud of him man. Like he really
turned it around and you know,

463
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:50,510
he's got a good head on his shoulders
while he's still in the hunt. Yeah, yeah,

464
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:54,570
yeah. I mean, he can recover from
the cowboy fight. He's, you know,

465
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,870
he's got some holes in his game,
but he could shore those up.

466
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,790
But he's got the one thing that you need
in order to cover up holes and that's

467
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:02,850
power. Savage. Yeah. Power.
Yeah. You know what I'm saying?

468
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:06,460
Like even though he got
holes, he got power, not just
power. He takes it well, yeah.

469
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,500
Yeah. He's got a great chance. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. He's got a great chance.

470
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,040
Toughest Shit. Talk his mind like he's
an absolute fighter. You absolute,

471
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,450
so he's the type of guy you just, hey man,
get on a heavy bag for 30 minutes now.

472
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,840
Takes raw meat. Go fight. Yeah. That's how
you train him. You know what I'm saying?

473
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,450
You just let them go. Right.
But don't you like it?

474
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,830
It seems like what they've
done at Jackson's dough is
made him more calculated.

475
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,760
Made it more technical, like if you
see some of his more recent fights, uh,

476
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,740
before the cowboy fight, he's, he's
fighting a more calculated style.

477
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,790
I liked the way it looks better.
Yeah. I mean, so that works.

478
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:46,590
But the problem is sometimes it takes
time to develop and that's okay.

479
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,870
Like my parents still has time,
so that's okay.

480
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,990
But the thing is you don't want to
calculate his authentic too much.

481
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,760
Calculate his defense, make
him more aware. But then
when it comes to all offense,

482
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,010
man, just punch him mother fucker in
the face, punch him in the fucking face.

483
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:05,280
That's it. Right. So offensively you
keep them aware and calculate it.

484
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,340
It's like his attitude. You just want
to like keep it the same. Yeah. Yeah.

485
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,051
And that's a problem.

486
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:13,160
Is it like some coaches and I'm not
blaming nobody over there, but um,

487
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,480
but you just have to make sure
you communicate with them to look,

488
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,460
I don't want to change the way you think.
Right.

489
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,130
I just won't make you more aware and
you going to be a better fighter if you

490
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,060
don't just run out there swinging wildly.
You,

491
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,200
we need something to do
before you can swing wildly.

492
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,070
What was it like for you to transition
from being a fighter to being a coach?

493
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,050
Is it it, was it a seamless process or
were there some hiccups along the way? No,

494
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:37,950
it was, it wasn't a seamless, I mean
it was seamless as, as, as it could be.

495
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:41,550
It was no hiccups really.
Because I can, I can identify it,

496
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:45,650
I can relate to a rumble because
I wasn't a fighter. Really? Yeah.

497
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,040
I always thought I was
an artist. Hmm. So when,

498
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,600
when I was time for me to transition,

499
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,900
I said I no longer want to
express myself by punching people.

500
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,840
I'm going to show people how to do it.
Hmm.

501
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,470
Do you like taking people that are already
good and making them better or do you

502
00:29:03,471 --> 00:29:05,150
like taking people that don't know shit?
I don't,

503
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:09,110
I think people that don't know shit
real. Yeah, I liked it. I like taking,

504
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:11,420
people don't know shit cause
like if you already good.

505
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,780
So I mean that's hard because like if
the already good and then you like,

506
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:18,500
you win a world title with them, right.
That's damn, you know what I'm saying?

507
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:22,250
Like there's no real, let me,
let me ask you, let me tell
you a guy like this. Okay.

508
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,870
What would you do with
Gustafson Gustafson? Yeah,

509
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,520
cause Gustafson that weird
spot, right? Can't be DC.

510
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,350
Can't be John flux up Glover to sharer.
Yeah.

511
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:35,000
It looks like a world beating
repeats. Jimmy Manoa. I mean he,

512
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,360
he's got world class talent for sure,

513
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:43,690
but it seems like it's just shy
of world championship caliber.

514
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,910
See but this, but as something that he
might have to like go soul searching for,

515
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:52,660
cause he might not have it, you
know, so if he don't have it.

516
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,370
So you just started going,
you know what,

517
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,260
I need to get vices and
make a bunch of money.

518
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,790
Do you think maybe it's where he trains?
Do you think maybe it's he, you know,

519
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,410
he's training overseas with,
you know,

520
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:05,800
he trains with the Leer Latifi
who was really good. Yeah.

521
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,910
I mean does he have World Class
coaching over there? I mean does he,

522
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:13,870
does he have worldclass sparring partners?
People that recognize patterns.

523
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,540
So that's, that's what I
think too. Is it in Europe?

524
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,690
And somebody mentioned this to me a couple
of a couple of months ago, is it in,

525
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:21,520
you're up to coaches are better really.

526
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,290
And I don't necessarily think that they're
better, but they're more attentive.

527
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,410
They're more attentive to
their fighters so they know.

528
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,170
So if Gus would leave his
coaching team as coaching staff,

529
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,080
I think he'd be at worst fight. I think
he needs to keep his coaching staff,

530
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,830
but maybe add something else to it.
We spent some time in alliance. Yeah.

531
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,790
And I think he needs, he needed that
he might need or just better partners.

532
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,960
He might just need a few better guys
to give him some different looks.

533
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,800
But I think the coaching staff
or his coach Steph is fine.

534
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,850
I've worked with someone before cause
Lro Latif he used to come to the top team

535
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,050
and I met all of them guys.

536
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,740
They're smart and they're more attentive
to their guys and American coaches,

537
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,970
American coaches, sometimes Guy Guy
Roller. Do what you gotta do it.

538
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,610
It's a bunch of good guys in a room. I
don't need to tell you nothing. Hmm. No.

539
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,120
So I think that's the biggest difference
between like America and then like in

540
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:13,810
Europe they're more attentive.
Do you think 10 of what is,

541
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,790
what's the reason for that? Just not
many. Not many guys to work with,

542
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,700
you know? So, um, you know, it was,

543
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,810
you go to the states here so big as
you go to a room, there's one coach,

544
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,290
20 fighters, right. Nicole is just
like, well you guys are good. Go ahead,

545
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,810
spar and whoever's left and going to
get you a fight. Yeah. And you're,

546
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,500
yeah. You know this, that's a
similarity with comedy managers.

547
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,210
It's a very similar thing.

548
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:43,630
Like there's some comedy managers that
have like a hundred clients and they just

549
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:48,190
like go out there and figure it out.
And if you take it to the top, yeah,

550
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:51,170
I've Seen Kevin Hart, oh yeah. Most had a
great manager. Look how good he got. No,

551
00:31:51,171 --> 00:31:54,280
it's just fucking Kevin Hart. You can
have Megan no matter who was his manager.

552
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,270
And then there's some that have like a
small amount of clients and I spent a lot

553
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:02,410
of time with them. Yeah. And they,
they, they calculate a career together.

554
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:06,370
They map it out. You know, I think
with fighters a lot of times you just,

555
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,880
it is a lot of like who's who's
left, who's still standing. Yeah.

556
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,090
Who's still standing. And I think,
you know, being a coach, a top team,

557
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:17,260
we have a lot of coaches so I think
that helps us. That place is so big.

558
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,480
It's so big.
It's so big.

559
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:23,820
We have a lot of fighters but we also
have a lot of coaches so we can give a man

560
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,480
a Nunez a hundred percent. She gets
whatever she wants so she can get,

561
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,370
she gets the attention and um,

562
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,790
and I think it's just great because she
can get that attention like in different

563
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:37,240
places. She might not be able to get
it. I mean she would still get it,

564
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:41,410
but with the level of our coaching
expertise is just ridiculous to them.

565
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,450
That sure is a savage.

566
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,850
I know she's a savage when she,

567
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,990
she had a smile on her face when
she was fucking upside Borg.

568
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,400
I know she had like a half a grin when
she was digging and like is a half grit

569
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,900
teeth half smile when she was fucking her
up. See, Ooh, it's a, people are like,

570
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,050
they never, I don't think they gave her no
credit. I did. Yeah. I mean at all. Yeah.

571
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:06,080
She hits her, she knocked out
Rhonda. She'd knocked out,

572
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,160
you know what we should do?
She beat him.

573
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:10,910
He states you're Nakita goes out but
enable. Oh yeah, she fights like a dude.

574
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,870
But she felt like a brother. Yeah, she
gets the swag. You know what I'm saying?

575
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:17,330
She finally like a brother.
But you know what, to me,

576
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:21,240
I think one of the most impressive
performances was Raquel Pennington. Yeah.

577
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,750
Cause I don't think people give
Raquel Pennington enough credit.

578
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,060
I think Raquel Pennington
was one of those girls.

579
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:28,010
Like you see her first
fight with Holly Holm.

580
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,400
She almost beat Holly Holmes
lost by split decision.

581
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:35,960
Her fight with the Ashley Evan Smith.
Holy Shit was that chaos.

582
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,260
And she gets her in that bulldog choke
and chokes her unconscious like one

583
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:42,920
second left. Like it was mad.
That's blood everywhere. I mean,

584
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,430
that girl is tough a shit. She's
a super, you're right, man.

585
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:50,630
She's super tough and when Amanda
fucked her up, I was like, good Lord.

586
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,790
There was like, this is a
different Amanda. She's,

587
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,930
she's got everything now
before she had the power,

588
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,170
but she didn't have the endurance
and she would fade and you know,

589
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:04,290
like perfect example was the cats and
ganel fight. She fucked cats and gone.

590
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:06,560
Oh well pat in that first round so bad,

591
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,080
that cat's head was fucked
up for years afterwards.

592
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,500
She was having problems with
their cortisol levels are
hormones were all fucked

593
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:16,010
up. She gave her hypo
thyroid. She gave her who?

594
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:19,070
She killed her thyroid in
that fight. Oh my God. Yes.

595
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,460
Like she talked about it on my podcast.
She's like, that girl hit me so hard.

596
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,730
She fell. She gave me a thyroid
condition. Oh my God. Yeah.

597
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:29,600
She went to all sorts of serious
fucking traumatic brain injury therapy

598
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:33,050
afterwards. They did the shit they
do for soldiers down in San Diego.

599
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,070
They did it with her. She, she
went about it in detail with my,

600
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:40,070
on my podcast from Amanda. She's
like, that bitch hits hard.

601
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,900
So hard, like different than anybody
else. I mean she's just, I mean,

602
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,390
she's really good at hitting home runs.
Like she's swaying,

603
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,430
her swing to contact ratio on the
money on the button is just high.

604
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:57,100
Yeah. And the, the force behind it you
saw when she clipped sideboards? Yeah.

605
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,770
I said, what am I god, I know it was over
as soon as he, soon I saw it. I said,

606
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:05,510
this is over. This is all busy. Crazy. But
Amanda is another one. It prime example,

607
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,620
because I've worked in,

608
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,040
I've worked in all Amanda's camps
except for maybe like this last one. Um,

609
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,540
but she's not a fighter,
believe it or not. Really?

610
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,790
What?
What does she,

611
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,040
she an athlete or is she's an artist.
She's an athlete.

612
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:26,090
She's an athlete and a competitor.
So here's the thing, like, you know,

613
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:29,320
you can't just put Amanda and
go, all right, spark, she's not,

614
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,800
and you try to push Amanda,
she's not gonna, she's not
gonna respond well to that.

615
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,190
And that was why I think, you know,
in a fight she would out because like,

616
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:39,990
she didn't train properly.
She wasn't happy.

617
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:43,500
What really what her training cause it
was like everybody was trying to push her

618
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:48,210
like a fighter. But when you let her
do her thing, she pushes herself.

619
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,420
Oh yeah.
She pushed herself to the limit.

620
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,920
But when you try to take control
of her, no, you need to do this.

621
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:57,900
You knew that she's not gonna respond
water that, but you let her do her thing.

622
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,570
Coach, I got this. Go ahead. You do
it. Well class, best of weird. Yup.

623
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,950
So for her,

624
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:09,030
what was the missing ingredient when you
looked at it like the early Amanda too?

625
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,050
Like w s champ, champ. Amanda. I think
it wasn't necessarily missing agreement.

626
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,590
I don't think it was just everybody
was pushing her too hard. Really? Yeah.

627
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,720
Believe it until you're pushing her too
hard. All you need to come in, you know,

628
00:36:19,721 --> 00:36:22,230
you come in and Russell for two hours,
you need to come in and do this.

629
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,770
You can't be a world champ if you don't
really train hard. And she was like,

630
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,280
oh no, I'm good. You know I'm good.
And I don't know if I'm down for that.

631
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,920
Just let me, let me do it. Let
me, let me figure this out.

632
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:35,130
Let me figure what my body needs and what
she figured out, what her body needs.

633
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:35,700
She said,
hi,

634
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,030
I'm a push myself and she gives no less
effort than what she would have gotten

635
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:39,864
before.

636
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,590
But she made a decision so maybe she
just doesn't like people telling her what

637
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:47,480
to do. I think I, yeah, I think
that has a big part of it. Yeah.

638
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,300
Cause like she's now the best of all
time. Yeah, no doubt. How does she,

639
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,180
she knocked out Cyborg in 50 fucking
seconds. She beat everybody. Yeah.

640
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,010
She fucked up. Me should take, I
mean she fucked up Ronda Rousey.

641
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:06,030
I mean she fucks up everybody. I know
she's the best. She is. No doubt about it.

642
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,810
No doubt about it. Beat
Valentina twice. Yeah. Yeah.

643
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,480
Anybody is other than her, who
is the best? It's Valentino.

644
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,050
Valentino is a beast.
She's a beast.

645
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,710
But I think that the more
confident Amanda gets,

646
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,890
she just walks Valentino down a beach.
She walks her down and beats her up.

647
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,280
If they fall, he's too big. Yeah. She's
just too big. Too good. Too quick.

648
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,280
So God damn long. But Valentina
so skillful. She's, yeah,

649
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,070
and that's like stylistically it
doesn't make for a great fight because

650
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:36,430
Valentina is so skillful, so like
it can show some Adderall. Yeah,

651
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,610
she gets the raw water and she's got
good defense and she moves her feet wet.

652
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:46,170
Yeah, she's really good. Yeah. I feel
bad for them. Other girls flyweight yeah.

653
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,380
Well she might take over that division
for a long fucking time. Yeah, for sure.

654
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,220
I mean,
if you look at what she did,

655
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,320
she shut you on Jay check down and Yung
j check was way healthier, way healthier.

656
00:37:55,321 --> 00:37:58,590
Flyweight then she wasn't straw way and
I feel like Straw weight, she just sucks.

657
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,590
Too much weight. You know, drains
or too much just she doesn't,

658
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:06,390
she's not as durable because you look
at the shots that she got hit with by

659
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:10,350
Valentina, they're probably
arguably harder shots. Yeah,

660
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,440
but she just, you're right.
She's more durable. Just not,

661
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:16,290
she can't cut that weight and
perform at the same level. Yeah.

662
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,020
I don't know why fighters feel
like best to answer all the time.

663
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,750
Cutting away at and weight cut
and wake. I hate it. I hate,

664
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:26,070
I'm like if you're going to allow seven
pounds to dictate whether you can beat

665
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:30,140
this guy or not, you got a problem. Yeah,
that you're not that good then. Yeah.

666
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,200
You should never allow like seven
pounds to dictate whether you could beat

667
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,034
somebody or not.

668
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,500
Do you think that the sport would be
better if they eliminated weight cutting

669
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:42,670
the way one fc did? I think so. I think
so too. I think I wish they would.

670
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,090
I think the performance would be better.
I think guys would be more durable.

671
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,540
They'd be able to take shots better
and I think there'd be less bullshit.

672
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,060
I think they just need more
options in terms of weight classes.

673
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,740
I think that's one. I think because
there's just too many giant jumps,

674
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,600
like a five to two oh five like what
the fuck is that? 20 pounds on lot.

675
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:06,580
Well, I mean that's just one issue with
the sport is like incredibly antiquated.

676
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,320
The weight class, I mean this stuff
was 20 years ago. I mean it was,

677
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,430
and we keep it at the same, like the
pay structure antiquated when bonuses,

678
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:20,140
but not when I'm like,
why are we have a window guy for winning?

679
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,470
You paying them double to
win. Yeah. Well not only that,

680
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:27,430
you're paying these assholes to judge.
Yeah.

681
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,750
Judging is terrible.

682
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:32,300
You paying people who don't know what
the fuck they're watching. There is.

683
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,320
I would love, I mean there's some
great judges, don't get me wrong.

684
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,960
If you're listening and you're a
judge and you're great, thank you.

685
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:40,720
There's some terrible judges and I want,

686
00:39:40,721 --> 00:39:44,380
I would like to know how many
of them have ever even trained.

687
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,010
Probably not many. If you,
if you're watching someone,

688
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,260
there's some crazy scramble and some guy
almost catches someone with something

689
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,430
and the guy gets away and almost catches
someone and it gets way the person who

690
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:01,030
doesn't train. Do they even understand
how close it was? Like how do they, yeah,

691
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,990
they don't, they don't know. How
could they know? How could they know?

692
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,760
They can't add. They can't. But, and,

693
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,880
and sometimes I get in arguments
with people about this too.

694
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,820
Another thing is like this,
you know, to open scoring.

695
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,630
I feel like we need open scorn.
I love that idea. I'm like,

696
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:20,800
cause as a coach you go into a fight
and like there's certain things that you

697
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:24,070
want to do and certain rounds based
on where you are in the fight. The

698
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,390
only argument against it is
that a guy would coast. Yeah.

699
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:30,650
Then the other guy would go crazy.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah.

700
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,480
I think it would be more exciting and go,
oh he's going to coach,

701
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,401
but this was happening.

702
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:36,340
Now it's both fighters are coasting
because they thought they won. Right.

703
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,520
That's both fighters are coasting
because they thought they won you.

704
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,640
You have to be crazy to think
that these judges got it right.

705
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,400
You have to be crazy. Yeah. I feel
like you won the first two rounds.

706
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:50,170
Like I got this. Yeah. You gotta be crazy.
Yeah. Hey, you never know. You never know.

707
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,280
Guessing. Yeah. I think sometimes they do.
I think they do too, but I'm like, man,

708
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,130
if I knew what the score was
going into the third round,

709
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,090
I would be have be able to tell
you better what you need to do.

710
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,410
Do you know Doug Looks Crosby?

711
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,600
You know he's a referee or judge whether
he told me once they're in the middle

712
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:07,630
of a fight and some
woman looked over at him,

713
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:12,040
a guy had another guy in the Komora and
he's like, what is he doing? What is that?

714
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,090
Oh my God. Like what
is a Kamora? Oh my God,

715
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,800
this is not something crazy.

716
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,360
And I mean he said a guys that are
in charge of your life, your career.

717
00:41:22,361 --> 00:41:24,940
Career. Yeah. And especially
in MMA. I mean, look,

718
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,670
it's terrible in boxing as well
as terrible decisions in boxing,

719
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:32,671
but this one is insane because it's
50% of your purse when bonus is 50%

720
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,400
in most cases. Yeah. I don't even
know why we still do that. Hate it.

721
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:39,770
Why do they still do that?
I hated guys fight their heart out.

722
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,630
They should get what they're
supposed to get paid. Yeah,

723
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:45,320
you should get what you get paid and the
only bonuses should be for finishing.

724
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,260
The idea that someone's
not going to fight hard,

725
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,280
like the knock going to fight
as hard as they would if they,

726
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,960
the guys want to win. Yeah.
Everybody wants a win for sure.

727
00:41:56,961 --> 00:42:00,980
Fight any harder, right, because
there's a wind bonus. No, that never,

728
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,710
I've never come back to a guy in
the corner and be like, hey listen,

729
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,260
you got that win bonus.
You got to win,

730
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,760
but you got to witness because of the
wind, but no, you want to win anyway.

731
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Some advice to fighters to stop
asking for those performance bonuses.

732
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,470
You're not going to get them when you ask.

733
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,590
It just doesn't work
that is that what it is?

734
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,790
They never get it unless they
need. It's obvious. Yeah.

735
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:28,310
You know there's some like
some wind bonuses where
you're like, of course. Yeah.

736
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,080
Well Connor started that whole thing,
didn't he? Did it? I think he did 50 g's,

737
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:37,550
baby. I think he might've been the one
to start that. Maybe he did, but again,

738
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,770
it was probably a performance
where he was going to get it.

739
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,750
[inaudible] he would have probably got
to, anyway, he had a probably got it.

740
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:44,760
Anyway. There was some guys do it on
fight pass prelims and I'm interviewing,

741
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,580
I'm like, man, I to get with shoes didn't
say that. You're not going to get this.

742
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:53,530
You might have gotten it if you didn't say
nothing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's this, uh,

743
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,590
I don't like that either.
I don't, I, I feel like the
performance bonuses, I'm like,

744
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:02,030
ah, I think they should give everybody a
bonus if you finish because then you're

745
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:05,360
going to get guys looking to finish.
That's a great idea. That's a great idea.

746
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:09,340
Having a finished bonus. Yeah.
Oh, on every fight, every fight.

747
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,750
If you finish here,
you get paid what?

748
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:15,560
You get paid when a loss and then there's
a few finished amount of dollars for

749
00:43:15,561 --> 00:43:20,390
every finish, finish, 20 grand, whatever
it is. You finish it. I agree with that.

750
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,320
That's great. I think that, uh,
I, I do think that there's a real,

751
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,800
I think it's unfair that
you don't fix the judging,

752
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,080
but yet you also have wind bonuses.
I think that's unfair. It is. Ah,

753
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,520
I don't like it.
The fact that you just told me that story,

754
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:38,750
I got breaks my heart to think that
these guys are judging and control of

755
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:41,390
everybody's career and he don't know
where to come more is there's a lot of

756
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:43,580
people like that out there. There's
a lot of people. I thought it,

757
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,360
I mean we've seen,

758
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,680
we've seen scores where it's just so like,

759
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,690
this is what I think. I think first
of all three people is too few. Yeah.

760
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,980
I think seven should be the number.
That's a good number.

761
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,390
I would think I would like this.
I would like, like a good number,

762
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:03,380
like seven maybe. But then on top
of that, I want an online score.

763
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,160
I want to see what people, and
I want to get like, you know,

764
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,440
just experts like get a bunch of
fighters to give their input on it.

765
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,490
Like have a pool of experts. Yeah. You
know, it's like what it Tyron Woodley.

766
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:18,650
Think about that fight.
Oh Tyron is watching it at home.

767
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:22,040
He felt like it was this what, what did,
what did mighty mouse Johnson thing.

768
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,950
What did, what did Jon Jones thank
like if whoever wants to contribute,

769
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,270
who wants to contribute to the pool,

770
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:30,230
like have a verified account and say
this was, I'm scoring it at home.

771
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,500
It was this, you know, this, it was that,
and then you look at this online pool,

772
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,520
like 90% felt it should have gone this
way, but the judges went the other way.

773
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shit. Yeah. That kind
of shit would be very telling. Yeah.

774
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:46,560
And I don't get it like, cause we
all look at fights and go, all right,

775
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,980
that shit was not, that's not
how it went. This guy won.

776
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,940
But we all know he didn't win that
fight. What's like the bay? Can you put,

777
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:56,760
I'm trying to think of like what's the
most egregious example that you could,

778
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,320
you could come up with? Well I just saw
a fight in a, where was I? It was a,

779
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:05,310
Justin Scoggins fought a kid this recently
and I think he had dropped from USC

780
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:09,360
from that loss and it was a bad decision.
Oh the terrible. I'm thinking, Oh yeah,

781
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:11,890
I went, in fact I left to get something
to drink cause I was like I am.

782
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,140
He wanted that got dropped. Yeah. He just
fought in like Japan or somewhere. Yeah,

783
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,320
he's good. Yeah. He got
weird style tip sideways.

784
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,540
Looks like a small like Wonderboy boy
to go wrestle. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

785
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,930
What else? From the same area? Like I
do a lot of karate up in the Carolinas.

786
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,130
I think it's interesting.
Yeah.

787
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,160
Did you see that Robin black
breakdown of the dude this,

788
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:36,510
I've always said that one thing that I
used to see in sport karate and I see in

789
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:41,460
taekwondo was sliding. Like guys knew how
to lift up that front leg and slide in.

790
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:46,170
Yeah, it doesn't, I don't see that a lot
in MMA, but if someone was good at it,

791
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:48,150
there was like,
there was a guy that I used to train with.

792
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:52,020
His name was Larry Jones and Larry was
a, he was tall. He was like six too,

793
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,120
but his legs went up to his
armpits, man. It was crazy.

794
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,670
Which is fuck people up with his
front leg and taekwondo tournament.

795
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:05,520
He would just slide across blam yes.
Slide across.

796
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:08,100
And people just didn't know
what to do with that front leg.

797
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:11,670
They were trying to figure out
that front leg and Robin Black, uh,

798
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,240
see if you can find this. I think
it's on his Instagram. This dude,

799
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,280
I don't know who the guy is.
I never seen him fight before,

800
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:20,790
but he slides in with a sidekick.
Plam slides in again.

801
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,550
Blam and then goes to the
guy's face with this. I mean,

802
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:28,551
he's covering like 15 feet with his one
leg up in the air and one leg down just

803
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:31,500
sliding in with his hips and his momentum.
We'll see.

804
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,660
That's a unique skill to have. And I gotta
tell you, and like when me and Tyron,

805
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,990
when we first started training
for the one boat Wonderboy fight,

806
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,290
we couldn't find anybody
that could do that really.

807
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,370
And that's why a lot of people have
problems with Wonderboy because, oh yeah,

808
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,350
just get a bunch of guys. I could strike
posts of his striking is different.

809
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,290
It's different. It's different for
it. And here's the guy. Look at this.

810
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,380
Watch this guy do. Is it this
one? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do it
from the beginning though.

811
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,960
Yeah, but just reset it. Watch this
guy. Watch how this guy does this.

812
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:02,430
This is crazy. This is your one minute
CIA slides. Yeah. Look at this slide.

813
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:06,420
Watch this. Boom. That's some
serious slide. My goodness.

814
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,950
Serious coverage.

815
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:12,930
The distance of that incident that you
see a lot in those sport karate guys,

816
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,870
especially guys that know how to
correctly throw a front leg side kick.

817
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,820
And this dude, whoever this gentleman
is, he really knows how to do it.

818
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:24,540
What is his name? Jamie
folding. Jamie phone.

819
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,830
Click on his shit. I got to follow
that dude. Oh, he's a guy too.

820
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,370
Dang. He's gonna be tough. So I'm serious.

821
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:36,970
Fucking power would that front leg.
But it's, he's also, if you watch,

822
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,540
go back to that original clip again.
You watch what he does when he does it.

823
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,600
Watch how he lifts his knee up.
Waist Height,

824
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,950
which is critical because everybody,
the, the people that do it wrong,

825
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,370
their knee is low,
their knee is low and they're kicking up.

826
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,170
He's his Nigos high.
His nigos like when he throws it,

827
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:59,000
it comes off straight. See,
look how high his knees,

828
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,470
his knee is like upwards hip is,
and then as he throws it,

829
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,770
he throws it in a straight line
and you just get all this power.

830
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,540
See he even delay like he
just hop, hop, hop range.

831
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,370
Danny delivered.
Yeah man.

832
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:16,750
I used to see a lot of people in the the
taekwondo days that we're real good at

833
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,870
this and very few in MMA
until this guy like bang,

834
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,560
like that is a fucking look
at that stretch on this dude.

835
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,370
That's some serious flexibility to and
to fuck a guy up at the front leg side

836
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,350
kick to the dome like that.
That's incredible.

837
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,640
But it's the slide that's the most
impressive. The distance he goes. Yeah,

838
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:36,550
you're not used to that. You think
you're okay cause you're outside,

839
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,290
but you're not even nearly outside.
You're,

840
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:41,800
you're right in the wheelhouse and like
he doesn't have to change his position

841
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:45,580
and he's not, he's not vulnerable to
a lot of attacks weighing like that.

842
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,550
Wonderboy has an interesting way of doing,
it's a little bit different.

843
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,720
Wonderboy does a slide but he,
his leg comes up from the ground,

844
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:56,140
like he's lifting his foot up and
you're not even sure what it is.

845
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,690
And then as he's extending it, it's
still low and then he brings it up. Yay.

846
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,070
Stabs you in the stomach with
it. And you're like, what?

847
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,950
The Johnny Hendricks fights
a great example of that.

848
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,670
Johnny didn't know what the fuck he was
doing and then Johnny smiled and then he

849
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:12,250
got roundhouse kicked in the face.
Like what? Well, I'll tell you,

850
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,170
I mean it's just because like the way
Johnny came up a little bit later,

851
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:19,420
he came up after I did, but when I was
coming up, nobody, you couldn't do karate?

852
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,870
No. So karate, no karate. You do karate.

853
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,100
So like that,
that whole stigma towards karate,

854
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:31,220
just like it carried on for so long that
now like if you do karate, you got up,

855
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,930
you got an advantage because nobody
knows how to defend it. Right? Yeah.

856
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:38,470
There's definitely something to some
stuff. As long as you do the other shit.

857
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,670
Yeah. Something to some styles of karate.
Yeah. Connor does a lot of karate. Yeah.

858
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:46,300
You could tell me you see it in his style.
When we fought Aldo,

859
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,540
he'd tried to front leg,
so I kicked to the thigh back,

860
00:49:49,541 --> 00:49:52,990
but he's got a karate style. He's
moving in and out. Karate watches.

861
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,340
Not Moyie Thai. No. He's very elusive and
then, but when he gets him boxing range,

862
00:49:57,341 --> 00:50:00,790
he'd put them hands on. Yeah, the boxer.
Yeah. That's an interesting style.

863
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,830
That's an interesting way of doing it.
There's a,

864
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:06,670
there's just a bunch of different ways.
That's the beautiful thing about MMA.

865
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:10,150
There's a bunch of different ways to
do it, man. There's Ben aspirins way.

866
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,030
Just grab a hold you in. Gorilla fuck.
Begged me to the ground is my man.

867
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,340
That dude, I've known Ben since before
he started fighting. Like he, he came,

868
00:50:18,341 --> 00:50:21,740
stayed at my house, my dog bit
him and shit. Your dog to him,

869
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,270
you had a little Chihuahua.
Beethoven Shit. Ben. Yeah.
Ben Is my homeboy man. And,

870
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,000
and I think that,
uh,

871
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,000
I was nervous about him going into UFC
because I was thinking it, you know,

872
00:50:31,001 --> 00:50:34,760
they was gonna get him too late. Yeah.
You know, because like when he, you know,

873
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,440
but I still, I think he's still
easily, he's never taken any day.

874
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,780
He never takes no damage. So I was just
nervous that they get them too late.

875
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:45,560
But you know, Ben has been instrumental
entire Woodley's camps. I mean, he's just,

876
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,460
his brain is just like, we
think on the same lines, but
he's, he's a brilliant guy.

877
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,480
He's always sending me books. Justin's
like, he's smarter shit. Yeah.

878
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,380
But he's also very analytical in his
approach, you know, like he's not,

879
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,550
he's not gonna, you know, no disrespect
to George Groh Gel, but George go gel,

880
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:05,260
abandoned his Jujitsu and to start
banging. Ben's not, no, no. He,

881
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,550
he's never going to do
that. Yeah. Never happened.

882
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,070
And I liked the way he thinks too.
He's like, you know, like he didn't,

883
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:14,210
he doesn't spend time away from what
he's good at. He stays in that row.

884
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,190
Always coaching. Constantly
wrestling. Yeah. Yeah.

885
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:22,460
He's always coaching kids. But I mean
even even with himself like we'll go,

886
00:51:22,461 --> 00:51:26,960
we'll go up there bending China for
nothing will go up and Ben will give Tyron

887
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:29,540
how ever many rounds he needs. Real. Yeah.

888
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,010
You know most guys I've got to bring it
like two or three guys and they get time

889
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,750
or some work battle,
give them work no matter what.

890
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,570
No matter what kind of shape he's in,
he give tower and work.

891
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:43,610
Well he was talking about, you know if
they do open up that 165 pound division,

892
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:46,350
which I guess they're talking about
because there's so much talent in that

893
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:46,701
division.

894
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:51,020
I really think if they moved it to 75
and they had a 65 75 85 I think that's

895
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:55,010
better. Yeah. And then Ben would fight
at 65 cause he doesn't want to, you know,

896
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:57,440
fight Tyron,
tell him and tire and a real good friends.

897
00:51:57,441 --> 00:52:01,550
But I like a lot of match ups with him.
I really love the Robbie Lawler fight.

898
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,540
I mean, I know they pulled off that fight
because of the Anaheim card fell apart,

899
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,920
but they're going to fight.
Um, is it on Brooklyn?

900
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:11,360
I think they're fighting March 2nd. Is
that what it is? I think Sissy Robinson,

901
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:15,980
him and Robbie and I felt like they were
going to make that a headliner for a

902
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:16,814
fight night.

903
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,440
I felt like I saw a
Robbie's face as a head.

904
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:26,210
I don't know if that's been
solidified text and ask. Yeah, right.

905
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:30,800
Or Text Dana. Um, it's a,
it's a great matchup though.

906
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:35,990
That's where you see where Ben fits in is
against worldclass competition. I mean,

907
00:52:35,991 --> 00:52:40,650
you'll see where he fits in against world
class competition or see if Robbie is

908
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,360
done or not. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
It's a great fight for both guys.

909
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,680
Or if Robbie is still a savage.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean,

910
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,530
I like Robbie taking the time off too.
Yeah. I think that's important for Robbie.

911
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:54,290
I mean, you look at the wars. Yeah.

912
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:59,730
I went through the Carlos Condit fight
before the fucking Rory Macdonald fight

913
00:52:59,731 --> 00:53:04,120
to me. Good. Jesus Christ. I don't know
who gets out of that unscathed. Oh,

914
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,730
not a single human that's ever lived
gets out of that. And he needed that.

915
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:11,630
He needs time off. Yeah. Yeah. Cause
we didn't get hit like that and just,

916
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:16,880
he's a savvy, he's a fighter. When he
was screaming and his lip was split open,

917
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,230
I mean it was like a zipper was open.
Yeah.

918
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,550
And scream and I'm interviewing him
after the fight and I'm like, dude,

919
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:26,010
I could see your teeth.
Like literally see his teeth right

920
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:30,540
through his, his mouth right through
his lips. Oh yeah. My God. Yeah.

921
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:34,650
And he didn't give a fuck. No.
Stitch it up. No. Like, yeah, he's,

922
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:37,740
he's a fighter man. Like that's, that's,
that's the type of guy like, Hey,

923
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,690
get on that bag. Yeah. And those meat
at you. Well he used to not even spar,

924
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,260
which is really crazy when he's fighting
in Strikeforce. He wasn't even sparring.

925
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,750
And I asked him about, he goes, man,
I already know how to fight. Okay,

926
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:53,760
questions are over. Thank you.
Well, I mean also till you got an a,

927
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:56,160
but you got to look at it too, like
where he can, where it comes from.

928
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:59,130
Like you know them dudes in the
Midwest don't got no filter.

929
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,993
You know what I'm saying?

930
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:02,730
They was just trying to kick the shit out
of each other. Every spar and practice.

931
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,080
That was every practice, every
practice days, just knocking guys out,

932
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:10,200
drag him off the floor until they wake
up and then bring another guy and then

933
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:12,630
when you wake up,
bring them back in the back end.

934
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,290
It's really crazy when guys get KOD.
I remember that from boxing gyms.

935
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,240
You'd watch guys get dropped and then
they'd be sparring like 10 minutes later

936
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:24,280
like what are you doing?
You should be in the hospital.

937
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,090
Do you understand what just
happened to your brainstem? See,

938
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,120
I don't like that part of the game.
You know what?

939
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,970
I don't even know if it's even necessary.
It's not necessarily necessary.

940
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,080
It was ignorance because if that guy
gets hit again, he could get like,

941
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,220
do you know Joseph Valtellina after
he beat marked a bond and glory,

942
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,350
he won.
He won the title.

943
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,390
He was fucked up for months like he could,
he couldn't have any lights on.

944
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,381
He got to be in a room.

945
00:54:49,381 --> 00:54:53,340
He said that the light from like a
charger from a cell phone charger,

946
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:56,850
that little tiny little light would fuck
his head up. He'd give him headaches.

947
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,960
He had a severe concussion
of a, from a fight. He Won.

948
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:05,880
He got clipped with a giant knee
in that fight and just boom,

949
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,940
send his head back.
And even though he won the fight,

950
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,230
he still was fucked up for a long
time afterwards. I was looking at,

951
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,710
you sort of see two 35 takes shape,
but to title fights in three x UFC champs.

952
00:55:18,711 --> 00:55:21,780
So is that on the cards? It
says it's Jones. Anthony Smith.

953
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:26,040
Who Tyron versus Kamar who smile
and then ask her an and Lawler.

954
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,570
Whoo. That's it. There we go.
Is that March 2nd you, uh,

955
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,380
that's in Vegas, right? Yeah.
God Damn. Pray to the MMA.

956
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:35,580
God's Keith that card together.

957
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:40,100
Keep that a and then don't forget a
Pedro Munoz and I'm Cody Garbrandt. Ooh.

958
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,640
Wow. Wow. That's a fucking card. I know.

959
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,390
Fucking card.
Julio homes also on it.

960
00:55:50,391 --> 00:55:53,290
It's about Holly Holm. Aspin
lad. Don't get rid of that Ad.

961
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,730
Does that beat and Jeremy Stevens.
Holy Shit.

962
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:02,340
Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Mickey Gallen Diego Sanchez.

963
00:56:02,341 --> 00:56:07,010
Jesus OVN St Pru.
Aronov man,

964
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,790
that's a great car. That's a fucking
crazy card. That card bombs away, man.

965
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,180
That is a bomb's away card.
I um,

966
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,870
I don't know about the Anthony
Smith and John Jones. Wow.

967
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,320
I wonder why they, I don't even know why
they made that fight in the first place.

968
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,060
They probably just wants to needed

969
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:27,130
John wants to fight again. Really?
Yeah. John's probably won't look,

970
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,470
he had to take two years off.
No money.

971
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,040
All that bullshit finally gets
his title back. Cause like,

972
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:35,040
let's keep this ball
rolling. Yeah. You know,

973
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:40,050
and then probably also feels like the
best way to get back to like his top form

974
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,430
is to compete regularly,
you know,

975
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,730
gets loose so he could really
show what he can do. Yeah. I mean,

976
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,360
although the fucking pressure that
must have been on John from that fight,

977
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,370
you know, I mean, pardon me, that
wants to feel bad for him. I mean,

978
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:57,760
there's a lot of pressure on this young
man, but then a part of me is like, man,

979
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,910
will you stop fucking up?
Yeah. It's, it's, again,

980
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:04,930
I think it's what we're talking
about with fighters and you know,

981
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:10,120
they're crazy impulsive.
The why make mistakes so you stupid shit.

982
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:13,800
Especially if they like to party. Yeah.
You add that into the mix. I'm like, Ooh,

983
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,420
you're gonna make some piss.
Poor decisions.

984
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,340
And I should've saw the
science how hung out with John.

985
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:19,720
This was before he was big time.

986
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,450
It was in buffalo is like
some small show in Buffalo.

987
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:24,500
Like I don't even know why he was there.
And like,

988
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,840
he was just doing like fucking Jack
Daniel's like out the bottle. I was like,

989
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,850
what the fuck?
But that's also why he's so good.

990
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,610
He's such a wild motherfucker. That's
Po. I mean there's, there's, uh, an, uh,

991
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,820
an ingredient list and great champions,
you know,

992
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,560
and part of it is they just don't give
a fuck. They just are good. They go.

993
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:49,120
And that was what I was
saying about Amanda,

994
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:52,960
when you allow her to not give a
fuck and don't try to control her,

995
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:57,010
she's going to fucking
rise to the occasion. And,

996
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,430
but the problem is it doesn't work for
everybody because some people need to be

997
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:03,180
controlled because they can't rise
to the occasion like that. Right.

998
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:06,550
When you let them do their thing,
man, he just rise to the occasion.

999
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:11,440
It's fun trying to figure out what
is that, what's the right mix? Yeah,

1000
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,430
it's a Mike, Right. Mix of discipline and
conditioning. But then just being free.

1001
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,210
You know, Dominick Cruz brought
this up. We're doing commentary.

1002
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:22,600
It's like some guys fight better with
like a week's notice. Yeah. They just,

1003
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:26,020
no pressure. Just, she'll just
show up and they're good. You know,

1004
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,930
some people fight better
than the underdog. Nobody's,

1005
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:30,410
nobody's thinking they're
going to win that.

1006
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,640
Or I'll show you motherfuckers and
you go out there and put on a show.

1007
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,540
I also think it was part of a man at
that part of existing Amanda too. Is it?

1008
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:40,600
When she's the underdog, it's just
less pressure on her. So again,

1009
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:44,810
as another distraction away. So she's just
like, all right, watches the underdog.

1010
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,460
Watch how I fuck y'all. Y'All put
pressure on me to be the change, you know,

1011
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:51,760
to win this fight easily.
You know, I think she can
hold back a little bit. Well,

1012
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,580
she was this favorite
against Raquel Pennington.

1013
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,430
She's a favor against for cal and I think
that was one of our best performance.

1014
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,040
But Raquel hung in there a little
bit, you know, she did a little bit,

1015
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,013
but she didn't had a threat.

1016
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,650
We kind of had around her two and I don't
think she did. She had a chat around.

1017
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:06,910
You think she went around?
She,

1018
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:11,850
she took a man down at one point and had
around maybe? I don't think so. I mean,

1019
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:13,180
I don't get it.
I don't think he was,

1020
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,900
I don't have to think of man it was in
trouble or anything, but, hm. Interesting.

1021
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,100
I think Amanda won every round. If I
was, if I'm recalling it correctly,

1022
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,710
I'd have to go back and look at it. But
I remember thinking it was like a slow,

1023
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:29,210
steady beat down. It was, I mean it was,
I mean it was pretty, it was convincing.

1024
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,290
It was pretty easy fight for her,
but what the fuck is what's left for her?

1025
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,340
Especially like there's what one
legit featherweight size wise,

1026
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,210
it's Meegan Anderson,

1027
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,650
but Meagan got exposed a little bit by
Holly because Holly took her down and

1028
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:49,910
really dominated her in the clinch and
got her Kinda to the ground at will and

1029
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:54,500
I'm sure she's tightened up a lot
of that, but Nah, she doesn't.

1030
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,090
She's,
she's too slow.

1031
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:00,410
You think so a lot of
people don't understand like
speed is everything in this

1032
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:03,500
game really more so than size. That's
why I was saying about I cutting weight.

1033
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,680
Speed is key in this game and a lot of
people get exposed when they're not fast

1034
01:00:09,531 --> 01:00:10,760
enough. You know, because,

1035
01:00:10,761 --> 01:00:13,740
and I don't mean necessarily even just
speed and physically I guess heavyweight

1036
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:18,560
speed physically, but like
speed and decision making
speed, all that speed is key.

1037
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,480
And I don't think Megan
Hamson is going to be,

1038
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,760
have enough speed to deal with Amanda.
Well,

1039
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:25,490
you also have the thing to Megan
Anderson when she fought Holly Holm,

1040
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:28,040
that was her UFC debut.
Right.

1041
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:32,600
And that is that Octagon Shanae
legit. It's fun. We've all had,

1042
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,013
we've all had it.

1043
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:38,380
You see that moment where the bright
lights hit you for the first time and

1044
01:00:38,381 --> 01:00:42,200
you're like, whoa. And then also her
first fight is against Holly fucking home.

1045
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:44,040
I know. Jesus Christ. Yeah.

1046
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:49,270
I mean that's as experienced as you
get. I mean, Holly is, she's Woo.

1047
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:52,650
She like an 18 time world boxing champion.
Yeah.

1048
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,040
She was like 27 and two.
She has one of,

1049
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,970
until Amanda knocked outside board,

1050
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:03,680
she had the greatest highlight reel Kayo
and a championship fight. Well yeah,

1051
01:01:03,681 --> 01:01:08,681
in a championship fight because I
think that a Jessica on drudge when she

1052
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:14,030
knocked out Catalina Catalina
Kovacevich yeah, that was,

1053
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:19,120
that was a bigger than
knockout then. Yay. One, well,

1054
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:23,000
not bigger. It was right up there.
Yeah, it was right up there.

1055
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,860
But Amanda just took the fucking cake. It
was like, she's like out, that's my bed.

1056
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:29,721
She's like,

1057
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:34,340
you think he saw the best women's MMA KL
ever hold my beer because it's who she

1058
01:01:34,341 --> 01:01:39,090
did it too. I know. I know. Ah, it's
everything. And she did it as someone,

1059
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,260
I mean, I ain't gonna lie
man. I was surprised. As
much as I love Amanda, she's,

1060
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,080
you know, she's, I hold
her dear to my heart.

1061
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:49,030
I was even surprised who she
throws bricks. I know she throws,

1062
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,560
you know what she's like, she's like a
bowling ball on the end of a rope. Yep.

1063
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,500
Boom, boom. But, but if you,

1064
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,850
have you ever spent time around her and
hung out a little bit out the, you know,

1065
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:01,640
at the fights when she's not
fighting backstage? Very friendly.

1066
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:04,790
But this is what I'm saying. You know,
like a lot of fighters are like, you know,

1067
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:08,250
they can have kind of
aggressive personalities. She's
nothing like that. Right?

1068
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:11,670
I mean she likes to sit at home like she,
she's got an Instagram picture,

1069
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,480
like she's cutting the grass
and sand and flip flops.

1070
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:20,130
I mean he's just so
carefree. She just like, she

1071
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,780
likes to play with her dogs in the
backyard and well I was upset when she was

1072
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:29,310
fighting Ronda that all the promos
were about Rhonda coming back. Yeah,

1073
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,900
that pissed her off. I said
before that, before when she,

1074
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,400
when Rhonda was about to fight Holly Holm,

1075
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:38,010
I said that I disagreed with that fight.
I said,

1076
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:42,010
I really think Amanda Nunez is the most
dangerous challenge for Ronda. I see.

1077
01:02:42,011 --> 01:02:45,900
Cause Amanda has a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
black belt and her hands or what's really

1078
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:49,860
scary, like when Rhonda has to close
the distance to get ahold of you,

1079
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,540
when she gets you on the ground,
she's armed Barney.

1080
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,730
I'm going to felt like Amanda
like sizes up with her.

1081
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,250
But that's the most dangerous
challenge in my opinion.

1082
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,400
But then Holly knocked her out and then
when you saw Amanda Knock Out Rhonda,

1083
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,510
I was like, well this, how did you
guys not see this coming? Like,

1084
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:08,300
this is not a good match up.
And you,

1085
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:13,301
you spent the entire Promo talking about
this one person who's not the champion,

1086
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,860
who's coming back after
a devastating knockout.

1087
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,760
And then you didn't show anything about
the one person who is the champion,

1088
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:25,950
who's the first openly gay
women's champion in the
history of the sport, right?

1089
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,400
She's, she's the first
gay UFC champion. Yup.

1090
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:33,060
And she's a fucking destroyer.

1091
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:37,800
I mean she's exciting as shit and all
you're showing is Rhonda pacing around her

1092
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:39,270
mansion.
You know,

1093
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:43,170
Rhonda getting excited about this fight
and thinking I'm going to go out there

1094
01:03:43,171 --> 01:03:46,500
and like Jesus Christ and then
backstage here was what, it was crazy.

1095
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,460
I was listening to these agents
talk because Rhonda is fights.

1096
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:53,520
One of the things that was interesting
about it was a, she was such a force,

1097
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:58,521
such a cult of personality that she had
all these agents and shit around like

1098
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,160
all these,
like it was all agent to find backstage.

1099
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:07,050
So I hear these guys talking and one
agent Dork is talking to the other agent

1100
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,350
door and he goes, who's
Ronda fighting? And he's,

1101
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,520
I'm paraphrasing, but it, his base
that he said, I don't know who she is,

1102
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:18,650
but she's a victim. Like I don't know
who it is, what's called our facility.

1103
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,670
So they really thought that that
dot. Good idea. They had no idea.

1104
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:27,630
I mean, look, that's what
they were hoping. They were
hoping that Rhonda winds,

1105
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:30,900
because she's his gigantic superstar.
Like if Ronda comes back,

1106
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:35,790
beats Amanda Nunez wins a title back.
Rematches Holly Holm. Pete's Holly Holm.

1107
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,410
Yes,
she's back.

1108
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,190
But instead she gets
marked and 48 seconds.

1109
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:45,840
I mean Amanda just, and I was
saying to them afterwards, like, I,

1110
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:49,050
this is what I was telling you, like
how the fuck are you not promoting her?

1111
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,950
Like [inaudible] who she just did.
If you put equal time promoting her,

1112
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,890
now you got a new star in your hands.
Instead,

1113
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,770
the story is Rhonda Rousey got smashed.

1114
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:03,520
The story's not Amanda Smashwords.
Even afterwards they didn't,

1115
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:07,950
they didn't pick up what Amanda. Yes.
Yeah, I agree. It's crazy to me. Like,

1116
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,700
it's crazy to think that they thought
that this was going to be Rhonda come back

1117
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:14,870
to start him because, and I
thought you to break down. I said,

1118
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:15,721
I don't know if you saw it,

1119
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:19,540
but cause I scout or Amanda its
opponents and I do the breakdown.

1120
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,410
I come up with strategies for her
and after scout and Rhonda, I said,

1121
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,380
there's going to be easy fight for
you. And I told her that. I said,

1122
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:27,280
this isn't gonna be easy.

1123
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:32,500
And it turned out to be easy and it
just surprises me that they thought that

1124
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:35,290
this was going to be the come
out party for Rhonda. I don't,

1125
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:37,570
I didn't talk to Tina about it.
I told Dana before,

1126
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:38,950
I thought it was a
terrible mantra for Rhonda.

1127
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,070
But that was before the Holly Holm fight
and no, no, no. She got this. Well,

1128
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,890
he was saying you need, I don't know. He,

1129
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,360
he thought that I was saying that Holly
Holm, Ronda was going to beat Holly.

1130
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:51,410
I mean, well I'm not saying that's easy
either. That's a tough fight too. Yeah.

1131
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:54,040
But the thing about
Amanda is punching power.

1132
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:55,750
How he's not knowing for punching power.

1133
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,970
She's known for speed or kicks her
timing. Her technique. Her, her toughness.

1134
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,010
Yeah. She's known for all her
athleticism. Physical strength. Yeah.

1135
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:04,871
She's known for all those things.

1136
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:08,230
She's not known just to go in there
and blast girls. Yeah, like Amanda,

1137
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:11,020
the last people.
She puts them into another dimension.

1138
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:15,630
She's different in that respect, but they
didn't concentrate on that at all. Mike,

1139
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:18,880
how are you not concentrating on this
destroyer that Rhonda is about to face,

1140
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,630
but show them you should take fight and
people would just be like, Jesus. Yeah,

1141
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,180
beats stuff. Fuck out of her. And
then it's triangles around. I'm like,

1142
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:27,880
and you're like, God, I know.

1143
01:06:28,030 --> 01:06:30,750
That's why it surprised me that
they slept on Amanda. I'm like,

1144
01:06:30,751 --> 01:06:33,870
how y'all sleeping on her? Cause
it's Hollywood, man. They, they, the,

1145
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,550
the narrative that they had
was Rhonda was the best ever,

1146
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,180
which she was when she was
the best until she fell.

1147
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:44,260
But if you looked at the way she
fought Holly, this is my opinion.

1148
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:48,400
I feel like there was a million things
going on other than just fighting.

1149
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,590
There's a million things going on. There's
movie offers, this television shows,

1150
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:53,540
there's everybody's,

1151
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,280
there's agents in deals and books
and all this shit is happening.

1152
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:01,930
And then she's with Edmond. Okay. She's,
she's not an American top team. She's not,

1153
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,810
she's not dealing with a bunch of people
that are being a hundred percent honest

1154
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:09,990
and people who have a deep background of
experience of training worldclass mixed

1155
01:07:10,091 --> 01:07:13,510
martial arts fighters who recognize that
the holes in her game, the strengths,

1156
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:13,990
the weakness,

1157
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:18,910
someone like you who can like categorize
who she is and had a molder, there's no,

1158
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:22,390
there's no great minds
behind her orchestrating.

1159
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:24,730
This is just some guy telling her, oh,
you're great, you're getting better.

1160
01:07:24,731 --> 01:07:27,580
And she's holding him Manson shakes
great on the meds and she does a great on

1161
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:28,414
the minute.

1162
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:31,620
There's times when she didn't look too
bad on the meds when she fucked Batchko

1163
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:36,340
Hey, I'm pat pat, Pat, pat,
and she's in Brazil. You like
damn fucking kick box. Yeah.

1164
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:40,720
Right. But that's, there's a
big difference between that.

1165
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:45,130
And then being able to do that on
Amanda Nunez is a big difference. Yeah.

1166
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,200
And you need world class coaching.

1167
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:51,250
You need someone who's going to recognize
there's hiccups in what you're doing.

1168
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:54,910
There's, there's miss, there's
stages missing all. I mean,

1169
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:57,460
one of the things that Greg Jackson's
him when they prepared her for Holly Holm

1170
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,660
or per prepared Holly Holm for, they
said, if you look at how she, she engages,

1171
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,390
it's always grab with the left arm.

1172
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,110
It's always grabbing the left arm and
they were just move out to the side and if

1173
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:11,800
you lock when she ducked under Rhonda as
punch and she went to that right side,

1174
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:14,680
she's always going to that right side
and then boom, there's that head kick.

1175
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,070
That might've been one of the
funniest moments in the history. Okay.

1176
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:22,640
Duck de UFC was, he ducked that punch
and she hit the knee and hit the fence.

1177
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,500
Did I ain't gonna lie.
That was pretty funny.

1178
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:29,550
Well it was indicative of like some
serious errors and preparation and also I

1179
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:35,060
think the way she fought was just so
reckless. Just charge for champions.

1180
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:38,120
Don't fight like that. Right. But
I mean, but it's understandable.

1181
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,570
I'm going to say this in her defense is
understandable because that's who she

1182
01:08:41,571 --> 01:08:43,370
was at a time.
Like say she was the greatest ever.

1183
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:46,220
So she didn't expect to
ever be in this position.

1184
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:49,760
But true,
she got an opera,

1185
01:08:49,761 --> 01:08:53,060
she had an opportunity to correct
it and she dropped the ball on that.

1186
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,530
Well here's the thing about Ronda, she's
very smart. She's very, very smart,

1187
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:01,110
but she's also very strong minded.
And if wield,

1188
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:05,510
I believe there's probably very few
people that can pull her aside and go,

1189
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,700
you got to listen to me because you get
knocked the fuck out. This is real. Okay,

1190
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:13,100
you're the greatest.
You're the greatest ever have of course.

1191
01:09:13,101 --> 01:09:15,650
But this is not how you do this camp.

1192
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:19,070
This is not how you prepare for
this person. We need more. We need,

1193
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:19,881
we need different than,

1194
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:23,000
we don't need you to sparring boxing
with people cause you're not boxing.

1195
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,290
You're not going to have these gloves on.
We Need World Class MMA coaching.

1196
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:32,050
We need to figure out how to shoot and
landed double. You can't just be grabbing,

1197
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:35,440
clenching cause that shit doesn't work
on everybody. Right. And, and, and like,

1198
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:37,100
she almost got choked
out by Liz Carmouche.

1199
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:40,750
Remember that Liz had her
back a little bit. Yeah. That
she was ahead of the, yeah.

1200
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,480
Rhonda just gutted it
out and got out of it.

1201
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:46,190
She's such a great grappler in
her neck are so God damn strong.

1202
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:49,300
She gutted it out and made it out of
there. But that was dangerous. Yeah.

1203
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:52,670
Her job was fucked up after that
fight for a long time. Really? Yeah.

1204
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,660
From just getting cranked, just
getting, I mean, Liz Carmouche is, uh,

1205
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,660
she's, she's just strong.
I saw her, the ballet,

1206
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:03,050
they bitchy strong as strong as fuck.

1207
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,310
And she almost pulled it off. I mean,
she almost pulled it off from that.

1208
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:09,020
That headlock position is a very
dangerous position, right? Yeah.

1209
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:11,100
You headlock someone and their,

1210
01:10:11,101 --> 01:10:15,180
their legs go around and if that head
pops out were on your back. Yeah.

1211
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:19,280
It's the worst position if you can't pull
it off. Yeah. And that was her thing.

1212
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,430
Her thing was headlock people flipping
into the ground and it worked on almost

1213
01:10:22,431 --> 01:10:26,260
everybody, but it's like, Ooh, eventually
he's going to catch up eventually. Was in,

1214
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:29,330
maybe, maybe not, but the phone,
the thing is you need, look,

1215
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:33,440
you could look at a guy like mighty
mouse who we both agree is like the best

1216
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:36,830
expression of mixed martial arts talent.
That guy does everything.

1217
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,590
He shoots doubles. He'll
ankle pick, he'll fucking,

1218
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,290
he'll hit you with the flying arm bar.
He'll do whatever the fuck he wants.

1219
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:44,870
He could do everything you can't have,

1220
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:48,830
like you can't have only one approach
to success because as soon as someone

1221
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,960
figures out,
oh she grabs it that left arm,

1222
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,160
I'm just going to get
the fuck out of there.

1223
01:10:52,161 --> 01:10:55,490
I'm not going to be anywhere near that
left arm. Right. Yeah. Well that's,

1224
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,720
and I was saying about speed too.

1225
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:58,680
Like when you look at like got
like mighty mouse, like yeah,

1226
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:03,820
he's doing all that with speed and the
precision of his technique is just like

1227
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:07,730
unstoppable, ridiculous
speed. I grabbed him once,

1228
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,820
just joking around backstage and he
hit me with two knees to the body.

1229
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,570
I was like,
Geez,

1230
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:18,840
it was so fast. I was like, my brain
is too slow to even calculate that.

1231
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:23,280
You know that, that kind of
the Brit pop, I was like, oh,

1232
01:11:23,281 --> 01:11:24,390
you imagine the BDN Henry said,

1233
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:27,750
who when he fought him and had to
experience that and re the first fight in

1234
01:11:27,751 --> 01:11:31,800
particular realize like, oh Jesus,
I know, but Henry Henry came back,

1235
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:35,400
I was just made a joke. He
made an adjustment. But I
think in a rematch, I think,

1236
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:39,240
I think he's a beats him in a rematch.
Do you think Dj beats him in the rematch?

1237
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:43,110
I wonder if, because it was very
close. Very close. What I'm saying,

1238
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,340
it was a vague again,

1239
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:47,940
eventually it catches up to you to
get caught up to how did he win?

1240
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,330
He won by taking him down. He
didn't win by dominating on, right.

1241
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:55,890
It's not like mighty mouse beat him. He
destroyed him. Right. It's like he could,

1242
01:11:56,430 --> 01:12:00,180
he has a much better chance of finishing.
So who though then?

1243
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:03,480
So who doe has a finishing? Yeah, no
doubt. Yeah. So that's why I think Dj,

1244
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:04,380
if they fought again,

1245
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,570
I think DJ finishes and the only guy I
think gives DJ a problem. He might not,

1246
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,710
you might not know who. Um, well
we haven't seen Tj at one 25 yet,

1247
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,930
but uh, killed you whore. Gucci. Really?
Oh, mighty beat. Or Gucci. He did. Yeah,

1248
01:12:18,931 --> 01:12:22,350
but that was, that was years ago. Really?
Yeah. That was years ago. Yarn Barn.

1249
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:26,150
He dominated them and then
he did, he did, but fuck

1250
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:31,320
this guy. But this guy has got
speed coaching heart, Gucci. I,

1251
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,910
I've worked with them a little bit,
but I'm not like his main guy. Right.

1252
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:38,580
But this guy has got speed. Unbelievable
speed. It's got serious knockout power.

1253
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,930
Serious knockout power.
I have to say. Yeah,

1254
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,380
I believe you. I think he gets shit.
I think he gives, I think he gives Dj.

1255
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,990
I'm not saying that he will beat him
if they were fine, I'm just saying,

1256
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,010
but he could,
he could.

1257
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,480
I would thought Scoggins was a real threat
when I first saw Scoggins. I was like,

1258
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:57,600
he should've done, he should've been.
Yeah. I was like this guy with that style,

1259
01:12:57,601 --> 01:12:59,790
that karate style,
but also can wrestle.

1260
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,660
And Lena had to do it more with
coaching and anything. Now,

1261
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,520
and I hate to say that because he's
probably got a coach right now and listen

1262
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:06,354
and go down.

1263
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,220
But I really do think that it's like
maybe not really filling in his holes.

1264
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,360
You know, cause he's got a
lot to work with. Like you
said, like that karate style.

1265
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,480
He can wrestle.
I'm sure he's got decent submissions,

1266
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,150
but he's probably got some holes.
Coaching is so critical.

1267
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:25,860
Coaching can take a guy who could be a
journeymen and turned them into a world

1268
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:30,810
champion. There's, there's, there's
this pivot, like the fights you choose,

1269
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:34,500
the things you do when you
do them, you know, when,

1270
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:39,360
when to say no to things, when to say yes
to things. Yeah. Guidance and coaching.

1271
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:43,530
But the problem with fighters,
man is so damn hard headed. Yeah.

1272
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,000
You have to be right. Yeah. You have
crazy beliefs. Yeah you do. You got to,

1273
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,010
you have to. And that's like, like
we were saying earlier, like Amanda,

1274
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,820
she hard headed sometimes, you know, like,
but that's what got her, her success.

1275
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,750
But most fighters are hard and are
in a position to be hardheaded.

1276
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,140
And that's like the hard part. It's
like you tried to tell them, listen,

1277
01:14:01,141 --> 01:14:03,420
you need to listen to me right
now. And like, no, I got this.

1278
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:04,530
And then their careers just,

1279
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,980
it's crazy cause that's what made them a
fighter in the first place where I tell

1280
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:12,070
else to fuck all that father beat
their ass. They left the house

1281
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:14,260
and there's 16 fucked you.
I'll show the world

1282
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:20,410
that happened to me
as I have to me.

1283
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:21,870
And then next thing I know I'm out there

1284
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,510
fucking get in the cage. I feel bad
for dudes who didn't get dumped. I do.

1285
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:28,750
Why that? Cause it's good for you.
Yeah, it taught me a lot, man.

1286
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,850
I remember my girlfriend in
high school and dumped me.

1287
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:34,570
I was devastated for months.
Just devastated.

1288
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,210
But then I realized like what the
Fuck is wrong with me? And I thought,

1289
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:40,680
imagine if I married that girl.
Ooh Magic.

1290
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,580
I've had kids with her and Ooh.

1291
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:47,870
And every day was just
torture her bitching at me
and controlling and oh I got

1292
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:51,390
light, I got off light. Well
here's one for you to enjoy.

1293
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,780
Well same thing happened to me. I
got dumped in high school. Yeah.

1294
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,980
The girl started dating another dude.

1295
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,710
I ended up hitting this motherfucker
in here with a ranch of rent. Yeah.

1296
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,450
I had a hit the fucking hit with a wrench.

1297
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:07,970
Why'd you hit him in the
head with a wrench? He pissed
me off. Oh, he pissed me.

1298
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:09,250
He made me so mad.

1299
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,830
Did he make you mad cause he was banging
the girl or do you make me mad on top

1300
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,680
of that? Oh, on top of that.
Yeah. So I ended up hitting him.

1301
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:18,580
Then I ended up going to jail to him and
I ended up doing 52 weekends in jail.

1302
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:22,420
Damn. But within that time, every week,

1303
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:26,860
every weekend I had to go in on Friday,
four year, come out on Sunday for a year.

1304
01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,960
So I couldn't leave.
I couldn't leave my city.

1305
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:33,490
So in that time I taught myself how
to fight. That's why I'm here today.

1306
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,430
Wow. And during the weekends? No. So, uh,

1307
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:41,060
during the week, cause I couldn't
leave so I would just, I work.

1308
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:45,790
And then me and Paul Rodriguez, he fought
20 to Susan. You see 30 to me and him,

1309
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,070
we trained and we taught ourselves
how to fight in the backyard,

1310
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:52,490
watching videotapes. Wow. Tony D'souza,

1311
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,840
the originator of the Peruvian necktie.
Yep. Yep. That's what I came from.

1312
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:59,320
Is that really what I came for
us? He's Peruvian. No kitten.

1313
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:02,740
That's where it came from.
That Peruvian necktie is a mother fucker.

1314
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:04,770
That's a great move.
That was Tony Shit. Yeah.

1315
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,000
I incorporate that and on
one of my systems, man,

1316
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:09,750
I loved that movie was a hell
of a grappler. Yeah. Yeah.

1317
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,490
So he ended up choking
out a Paul Rodriguez,

1318
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:16,360
UFC 32 and I was in that.
I got knocked out by Bj.

1319
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,380
Wow.
But it all happened because I got dumped.

1320
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:25,630
Wow. That's crazy. He hit him
with a ranch, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

1321
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:29,370
I know. I ain't proud of
it. Yeah. How old were you?

1322
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:34,300
17 yeah. The frontal cortex not even
fully formed. That's what I'm saying.

1323
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:36,160
Like making dumb decisions.

1324
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:40,660
You 17 like you with the girl is 17 for
two years. That's half your damn life.

1325
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:45,160
I know, right. You know? So you thinking
that's the one also like the heartbreak.

1326
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:48,200
If you're not accustomed to it,
like everybody experiences heartbreak.

1327
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:51,370
Somebody breaks, breaks up with
you, like I feel like shit.

1328
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,560
But then you call your friends up
like, come on man, we'll go out,

1329
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,800
get a couple of drinks and then you
have a couple of dreams I, I whatever.

1330
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:59,080
And then you get a text from
an x and you're like, oh

1331
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:03,260
yeah, here it goes back in the
game and you'll be all right.

1332
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,210
That girl. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I,

1333
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:09,320
I think it's good to get broken up with
it is you learn, you know, you learn,

1334
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,100
you also,
you learned

1335
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,230
why you were annoying to her.
You know,

1336
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:15,050
like there's some stupid shit that
you're doing and you don't even realize

1337
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:15,884
you're doing,

1338
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,890
but you're doing it and then it becomes
a pattern and you do it again and again

1339
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:22,250
and again. Then finally they'd dump you
and then you get some reflection time.

1340
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:24,230
You're like, Ugh, why am I so annoying?

1341
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:28,610
I remember you said talk about that
before about like self reflection and

1342
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,470
awareness and like that's so important,
man.

1343
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:35,090
It's critical being real to yourself and
aware and being aware of where you are

1344
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:39,380
in relation to everybody else in the
world. I try to coach myself d yeah.

1345
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,760
I tried to sit down with myself and when
I do like meditation sessions and Shit,

1346
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:47,840
I try to pretend that I'm like a coach
and I'm looking at myself. Honestly.

1347
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,200
I was like, all right dude, you ain't
spending nearly enough time doing this.

1348
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,720
Well you need to fix that. Like,
hey, you're right. And they're like,

1349
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,170
no bath and that's great.
I had to start doing that.

1350
01:17:57,230 --> 01:18:02,230
It's a skill like you have to like
develop it because I think that's part of

1351
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:08,300
most people's problems is that they're
not aware of where they are in life.

1352
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,750
You know, one other product problem
that people have to his momentum,

1353
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,790
they get caught up in momentum of doing
stupid shit or momentum of being lazy or

1354
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:21,430
momentum of eating bad or
drinking or whatever it is
that does. That's bad. Yeah.

1355
01:18:21,450 --> 01:18:25,790
And they can't break that. You get caught
up and you need to stop reflection.

1356
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:29,870
And that's one of the reasons why I think
meditation is so important. Oh yeah.

1357
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:33,230
I meditate every day. Do you? Yeah.
How do you do it? What do you do? Um,

1358
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,110
I lay down and close my eyes.

1359
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:39,620
So what I'll do is I'll start with some
self talk first just to get me going.

1360
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,410
Self talk,
positive affirmation statements.

1361
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:46,910
Just lay down quiet for about 10 minutes
example. Like what kind of self talk?

1362
01:18:46,911 --> 01:18:50,810
Like what do you, what kind of positive
affirmation, you know, just um, uh,

1363
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:56,100
you know, I appreciate life,
appreciate where I'm at. Yeah. I'm,

1364
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:00,890
I'm gonna keep going. I'm doing
my, you know, just um, every day.

1365
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:05,300
Strive to be better, you know, or I'll
get even more detailed, you know. Um,

1366
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,010
you know, uh, you know,

1367
01:19:07,011 --> 01:19:09,080
I do a lot of entertained Chad to
do a lot of entertainment stuff,

1368
01:19:09,081 --> 01:19:11,900
so I want to get better at public
speaking, so I'll, you know,

1369
01:19:11,901 --> 01:19:14,510
trying to talk myself until a
little stand up. Yeah. Do standup.

1370
01:19:14,570 --> 01:19:18,890
I do every so often. Very funny. Ah,
already funding, not at the diamond bar.

1371
01:19:18,891 --> 01:19:23,750
Last time I was there. That's tough. That
time. Bars sketchy. Is it really good?

1372
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:26,930
That makes me feel better. Yeah. Yeah.
Jeremy Pivot said the same thing. He said,

1373
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:31,430
yeah, I bombed. I was like
not when I was at. Yeah. But
um, but not so I've tried to,

1374
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:37,010
you know, I'm intelligent, I'm
smart, I'm going to make it,

1375
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,050
I got this, I'm making
lots of money. You know,

1376
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:40,900
I tried to talk myself
into that and then I,

1377
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:45,100
and then for the next 20 minutes or so
I just sit in silence and just let all

1378
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:50,060
that Soakin do you concentrate on your
breathing or anything? Cause you know,

1379
01:19:50,061 --> 01:19:53,780
like if I get distracted like noise or
whatever at center, back to my breathing.

1380
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,310
Yeah.
That's the big one for me.

1381
01:19:55,311 --> 01:19:57,410
I've tried a bunch of
different styles of meditation,

1382
01:19:57,411 --> 01:20:02,180
but one that I liked the best,
especially in the tank is a breathing.

1383
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:06,940
You bring shorts with you
today. Yeah. No, but yeah.

1384
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,070
Have you done the tank?

1385
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,320
No. What is that? You never heard
about it? No, I never done that.

1386
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:14,570
You could do it today. I want to go time.
Okay. We'll set it up. I want to do this.

1387
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,490
Yeah, I try it out here. I'll show it to
you as someone assessed on by some tank.

1388
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,470
Yeah. What is that? Yeah. I
don't even know what that is.

1389
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:21,990
There was only one guy who's
uses tank other than me.

1390
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,650
And Jamie's been sneaking here in the
middle of the night is a Dan Harris from

1391
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:28,920
good morning America. He's used it
cause he's a, he's a big meditator.

1392
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,680
I set him up with it, but it's amazing.
It's a tank that's filled up with,

1393
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:37,350
it's a flotation tank. It's a, it was
made by this guy named John Lilly who was,

1394
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:41,340
uh, a psychedelic adventure and a
pioneer, an interspecies communication.

1395
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:44,430
He was a working on trying
to communicate with dolphins.

1396
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:48,900
He was take acid and getting the tank
and take acid and give dolphins acid and

1397
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:53,490
he was out of his fucking mind.
Lily was a real trip.

1398
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,530
You know, his books are amazing. He
was a, uh, like a super genius who was,

1399
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:03,210
um, he was going through his career
during this psychedelic revolution,

1400
01:21:03,211 --> 01:21:06,570
like the Timothy Leary's and
all those people have the time.

1401
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,010
Terrence Mckenna and he did.

1402
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:13,160
He was trying to figure out a way to
separate the mind from the body. And one,

1403
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:16,020
one thing that he realized
is like sensory input.

1404
01:21:16,770 --> 01:21:19,740
Like you and I are sitting here, you're,
you're, but it's touching the chair.

1405
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:23,160
Your feet are touching the floor.
You feel the table, all that stuff.

1406
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:26,520
Those are signals. Those signals go to
your brain, your brain's processing that.

1407
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:27,210
And the way I,

1408
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:30,450
the analogy that I was making is
imagine if you and I were having this

1409
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:32,960
conversation, but right over there
there was a dude with a jackhammer that,

1410
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:34,860
that that data,
we can still talk,

1411
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:37,920
but it would be super distracting and
maybe wouldn't be able to express yourself

1412
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,580
the right way because you would be
taking in the input of all that noise.

1413
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:42,691
So we'd be like,
hey man,

1414
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:45,120
let's go talk over there where it's
quiet and you go talk over there.

1415
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:47,490
And it would be easier because
it'd be no distraction.

1416
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,610
Well your whole body's a distraction.
Everything is a distraction sitting down.

1417
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,100
So distraction the lights in
this room or a distraction.

1418
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:57,180
The fact that Jamie's here and the tables
here and you're taking into account

1419
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:02,070
all the objects around you and
this is all input without input,

1420
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:05,850
your brain becomes a very different thing.
So when the tank,

1421
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:08,730
the water is heated to 94 degrees,

1422
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:10,530
that's the temperature of
the surface of your skin.

1423
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:14,100
Then there's a thousand pounds
of Epsom salts in the water.

1424
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:17,910
So which is really good because your body
gets the magnesium from that but also

1425
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:20,520
really good because you
float like a motherfucker.

1426
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:24,360
You lie in that thing and half the, your
body is above the surface of the water.

1427
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,790
You're just floating cause there's
so much salt, it's so dense.

1428
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:30,870
And then you lay back and then he
closed the door. Total darkness.

1429
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:33,990
You don't see any that you open your
eyes just as dark is when you close your

1430
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:37,230
eyes. Then total silence,
your ears are underwater.

1431
01:22:37,231 --> 01:22:41,310
You just lay in there floating in this
water. And once you, once you send her,

1432
01:22:41,311 --> 01:22:44,520
cause you kind of wiggle around a little
bit cause of waters swishing you cause

1433
01:22:44,521 --> 01:22:47,880
you step into it and you know you gotta
you gotta let the water settle in,

1434
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:52,530
relax and then let your arms settle and
you can't tell where the water is and

1435
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:53,131
where the error is.

1436
01:22:53,131 --> 01:22:56,110
Cause it's all the same temperature
cause the water's the same temperatures.

1437
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,220
Your skin, you don't feel the water
after awhile and you get relaxed.

1438
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,540
So then when I'm in the tank,

1439
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,840
then I concentrate on my breathing on
concentrating is in with good out with the

1440
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:08,800
bad in with the good out with the bad.

1441
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:13,540
I'm just concentrated in breathing
through my nose, out through the mouth

1442
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:18,520
and I'm only letting myself
concentrate on the nose.

1443
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:23,350
But I'll think about stupid shit like oh
I gotta clean my closet and I got to do

1444
01:23:23,351 --> 01:23:27,310
this and I haven't been to yoga in a
week and I have all those thoughts.

1445
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:30,490
Eventually will go away. I just got
to go [inaudible] don't do that.

1446
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:33,400
Don't do that. Don't think about that.
Like man I need my thick by Lisa.

1447
01:23:33,401 --> 01:23:36,830
My car's up soon and you
can't let those venire. Right.

1448
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:38,890
Just got to think of the breath
breathing in through the nose,

1449
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:42,640
out through the mouth. And you ne. I
never in all my times of doing this,

1450
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:46,540
I've never had a pure experience where I
didn't have to fight off those thoughts

1451
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:48,460
and something for sure.
Think they all.

1452
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:51,630
One day you'll get to a point where
you just hold that in and a half.

1453
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,130
Never had that. Never been
there. Never. I try all the time.

1454
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:58,540
But when you have the absence,
an absence of any sensory input,

1455
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:02,470
your brain becomes supercharged.
You could see your life much more clearly.

1456
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:05,290
There's nothing there but
you and your thoughts.

1457
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:09,400
Your mind is detached from your body.
And this is what Lilly figured out.

1458
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:14,230
He figured out a way to separate
the body from the mind. Damn.

1459
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,460
But you show how I'm a float.

1460
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:18,380
Cause you know black people don't swim
to announce when we either really sink

1461
01:24:18,381 --> 01:24:21,040
like a rock. All right, good.
Yeah. Did I send like a rock?

1462
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,540
I barely could tread water.
Barely even in the ocean.

1463
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:29,140
I struggle trying to die.
Your dense man, I'm sure.

1464
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:32,770
But that thing is so there's
so much salt in that water.

1465
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:34,630
Everybody floats every afloat.
Yeah.

1466
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,050
It's basically like it has
to be stirred up every day.

1467
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:39,910
There's a pump that
constantly circulates it.

1468
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:43,870
It's got all these old water purification
tanks that are attached to it.

1469
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:47,830
There's purification filters rather for
like, uh, they're, they're these giant,

1470
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,520
the guy who made it is my friend crash
who runs the float lab in Venice,

1471
01:24:51,521 --> 01:24:54,520
which is the premier
distributor of float tanks.

1472
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:58,600
They make the best shit on the planet
bar none. He's a mad scientist.

1473
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,070
When you see the whole setup back there,

1474
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:04,150
you realize like there's so much salt
in it that it has to constantly be

1475
01:25:04,151 --> 01:25:05,740
recycled and move through.

1476
01:25:05,741 --> 01:25:08,970
Otherwise it will crystallize and
you get these giant salt rock,

1477
01:25:08,971 --> 01:25:12,730
so he gets pulled out of it. So it's
going to constantly, you're gonna float,

1478
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:15,100
you'll float. Look, it's
going to be beautiful.

1479
01:25:15,101 --> 01:25:17,470
It will be like that baby in
Nirvana just floating around there.

1480
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,830
You're going to love it. It's amazing.
I definitely want to try. Yeah, it's,

1481
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:25,570
but I feel like att could benefit
from having one of those down there.

1482
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:28,000
It's a really good thing for fighters.

1483
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:31,360
It's really good thing for relaxing
like Epson salt baths. Right.

1484
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:35,770
And that's does giant for just loosening
your muscles and relaxing good therapy

1485
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:36,610
after you train.

1486
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:40,120
That's the more Epsom salts and you're
ever going to get in a fucking bathtub.

1487
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:43,570
Yeah. That is real Epsom salts. Do you
put that thing around a bunch of fighters?

1488
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:48,010
This Stasha Miss Jason in their
[inaudible] going to steal it.

1489
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,710
Att has a, you guys have dorms too,
right? We got dorms. That's crazy.

1490
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:58,810
That's great though.
I mean it really,

1491
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:01,810
it's really helpful to the guys because
we got all the times we got like

1492
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:03,850
presents and Dagestani.
Yeah.

1493
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,380
And Greg live in there, so it's
crazy. Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing.

1494
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:12,680
I mean, it's good though, man. I mean
it's uh, it's the best gym on the planet.

1495
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,530
Can't complain. But certainly
one of them. I mean, yeah.

1496
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:18,560
In terms of the actual overall facility,

1497
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:22,970
I don't think there's another facility
like it on earth. No, it's number one.

1498
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,960
Right. In terms of the size and size
and all what Dan Lambert has done.

1499
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:31,280
Like fucking God blessed Dan Lambert guys
put more money into the development of

1500
01:26:31,281 --> 01:26:33,910
MMA than anybody other than the fatigue.
And there's,

1501
01:26:34,220 --> 01:26:36,080
there's absolutely no doubt about that.

1502
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:39,740
I can't think of another guy who has
been around as long and as pumped more of

1503
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:43,730
his own money into just helping
guys. And he's such a good guy. Yeah.

1504
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:47,660
He's such a good guy
in a fucking real man.

1505
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:49,010
A man's man,

1506
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,550
but not just a rich guy that's throwing
his money and he fucking trains,

1507
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:55,610
trains his black belt legit
like he had in his house.

1508
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,250
He had a gym and he used to have all
the dudes come over back in the day.

1509
01:26:58,270 --> 01:27:01,700
Moral boost to mice and the come over.

1510
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,600
Logan are brothers be that training with
him. He's a legit, yeah, he loves it.

1511
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:09,200
I mean legitimately loves the sport. Like
when Amanda One and he was in the cage,

1512
01:27:09,201 --> 01:27:12,230
he was so happy he passed.
She had a tears crying and shit.

1513
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:15,020
He say he's a legit dude,
man. He's very legit.

1514
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:18,350
But what he's done is amazing because he
had an amazing gym already and then he

1515
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:21,140
built this gigantic fucking facility,

1516
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:25,710
built it from the ground up specifically
like, yeah, you're right. Yeah.

1517
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:29,870
Bought the land and built the
gym on top of it. Fuck does that.

1518
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:33,260
Everyone else just goes to a
warehouse and go, yeah, okay,

1519
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:36,650
we'll set up the cage over here.
No, he designed it. I know.

1520
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:38,990
I wish they had designed it a little
differently though because I would like to

1521
01:27:38,991 --> 01:27:43,370
have seen the um, the pros
separated. How so? Um,

1522
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:45,950
from like general population. Oh,
I see what you're saying. You know,

1523
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,550
like that's not that it might, I mean
it's easy to look back, hindsight and say,

1524
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:52,040
yeah, it was better if they were
separated. But like now it's kind of like,

1525
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,850
you kind of want to separate
your pros from like, you know,

1526
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:58,780
five year olds taking class. You know,
you're right. You know, uh, you know,

1527
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,500
our Lawsky walking around with no shirt
on and hairy chest bumping into like

1528
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:06,800
some old lady who was there with her
grandson. You know, you look at his nose,

1529
01:28:06,801 --> 01:28:10,860
he's like, yeah, that's a bit scary,
you know. So I mean it just, you know,

1530
01:28:10,910 --> 01:28:12,380
my selfish and this is like,
yeah man,

1531
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:15,040
we need to get to stay on the
side so we can, yeah. Yeah.

1532
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:19,910
Well how many regular folks do you have
coming into the gym? I regular folks?

1533
01:28:19,911 --> 01:28:23,480
Yeah. Oh, I mean it's a whole thing
of like regular folks. Real. Yeah.

1534
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,020
So like classes for little kids,
classes for little kids,

1535
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:32,480
regular Jujitsu, banging
out and the same, I mean,

1536
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:35,240
we do a good enough job of having
to bang out sessions in the morning,

1537
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:38,210
like at night, you know, it
was still running to, you know,

1538
01:28:38,211 --> 01:28:40,970
the fighters are still
running around acting a fool.

1539
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:46,310
Is there good pictures of what it looks
like online? Yeah. Yeah. I think Google,

1540
01:28:46,450 --> 01:28:49,910
American top team, top team,
the new gym in particular.

1541
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:54,450
Fucking incredible facility, man. Yeah.
How much of that shit cost? I don't know.

1542
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:59,940
I don't know. I just a landlord to
think about it. I hear that place.

1543
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,040
I mean it's,
you know,

1544
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,990
south Florida too. So yeah,
it's expensive as shit that,

1545
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,550
that's a amazing facility too.
And they have a giant,

1546
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,910
well how big the math
space says holy shit.

1547
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:15,660
Stadium stairs or seats did they have,
um,

1548
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,340
they have a whole
strength and conditioning.

1549
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:20,620
So I've on that go on the other end of
that where you see that Manhattan, they,

1550
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:24,630
the condition is not over there and wow,
that's amazing.

1551
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,780
Yeah. I mean that's what
everybody hopes for. I mean,

1552
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,380
how many people must move down there
just to be able to train there?

1553
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:33,750
You know,
honestly we don't,

1554
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:36,870
I mean we do get a lot of people that
move down there just to train there.

1555
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:41,610
But I think we do better with guys
who come and just do camp billing.

1556
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:46,500
Yeah. How come? I Dunno.
I Dunno. We just seem to,

1557
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:50,490
cause we can provide for them. We
have dorms. Yeah. So we have dorms,

1558
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:55,700
so it seems to work out better for most
guys where they live somewhere else and

1559
01:29:55,801 --> 01:29:57,330
then they want to just come do camps.

1560
01:29:57,331 --> 01:30:00,900
They come for six weeks a stay in a dorm
for six weeks. We tightened them up.

1561
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,300
Boom. Yeah. Does that

1562
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,530
all lot of people do to Robbie
was doing that right now.

1563
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:11,020
Robbie actually moved down. He moved
down, but yeah, robbing move now. Um,

1564
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:13,860
Tyron was doing that,
right? Not really sweet.

1565
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,780
Tyron comes down whenever
he feels like it,

1566
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,450
but he does his camps it in Milwaukee
wit and we'd go to Duke. Roufus is,

1567
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:25,690
what do you think about him fighting
it loose man? I like loose man.

1568
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:29,280
It was great fun. Yeah. I've always liked
loose mine. I like him as a fighter.

1569
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I don't know him as a person,
but as a fighter he's fucking
terrifying. Yeah. He's,

1570
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:37,590
he's super smart. He's really
good. He's very versatile. Briefly.

1571
01:30:37,890 --> 01:30:41,970
He can do everything. So that's why I
think it's more of a challenge than Colby.

1572
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:42,930
Yeah.

1573
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:47,930
Because Uzman spin brings more to
the table striking power wise power.

1574
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:53,150
And the Colby thing though was in
terms of like a marketing fight,

1575
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,240
like I felt like that was a
very good fight marketing wise.

1576
01:30:57,660 --> 01:31:00,580
I think they could have had that
fight stand alone. Yeah. You know,

1577
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:03,870
I don't wonder why they didn't do
though. They I think, but you know,

1578
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:05,300
don't think it could have
had that fight standalone.

1579
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:08,820
They didn't need John Jones and Anthony
Smith. I think Colby talks a lot of shit.

1580
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:12,590
Other than that, he doesn't just talk
shit when the cameras are on a bet.

1581
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,860
He Talk Shit all the time.

1582
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:19,320
Like we had Kobe and camp sometimes and
like I remember when he first started

1583
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:22,200
fighting and we was always cordial,
but now, you know what I'm saying?

1584
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:25,620
Like I don't even talk to him. He, he
goes his way in a gym. We pass each other.

1585
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,040
Why is that? Just as
awkward. Yeah. You know,

1586
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:32,880
it's like he's talking about my homeboy
tiring, you know, 10 he's dogging him out,

1587
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:35,980
you know? And, but you also know
that he's got to do that. Yeah,

1588
01:31:35,981 --> 01:31:38,730
I knew it was going to get the fight.
I'll say this too.

1589
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:41,970
Like even though I know that
I'm still like happy for him,

1590
01:31:42,570 --> 01:31:45,180
I'm happy did he was able to
get to success. He's gotten,

1591
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:47,990
whether it was from talking or not,
they still wanting to fights.

1592
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,270
He's still beat dos Anjos and he
beat those on Jill's convincingly.

1593
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,150
He beat Joe site. Yes. So he's still won.

1594
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:59,130
He talked a lot and I'm happy for him
but, but I was just hoping that, you know,

1595
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:00,340
it's time to face the music.

1596
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,230
Yeah, you deserve. Does ass woman.

1597
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:07,590
Well I think the UFC offered him
loose mon and I think he said no.

1598
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,560
I see. I think he said he wants
to fight Tyron and they'll like,

1599
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:13,690
you're not in any position to the side.

1600
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:17,680
And even though they had promised
him a shot at the title before,

1601
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:19,900
Ben Aspirin said,
did you believe Dana white

1602
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:25,820
ass good tweeted to him. And
he said, I love Ben. He's,

1603
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:29,680
he's the most ruthless when
it comes to Twitter. Yeah.

1604
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:34,030
He's the most ruthless honesty.
That's hilarious. To check it.

1605
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:37,330
Check onto your skirt,
man. Ben, I'll get you.

1606
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:42,490
It's a great fight though.
Uzman entire and I'm not mad at the fight.

1607
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:46,190
I do kind of wish that Colby was getting
a shot because I want to see that fight

1608
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:49,480
and I don't know if I will ever
see that fight. Tyron. Tyrons Matt,

1609
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:53,370
he doesn't like Colby.
He doesn't like degree yet.

1610
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,680
And angry Tyron is a scary human being.

1611
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:01,880
He might be the fastest, hardest hitting
170 pounds of that's ever lived. Yeah.

1612
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,560
Who the fuck is faster than tiring?
Who the fuck hits harder?

1613
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,060
You look at his fights with Wonderboy.

1614
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:10,570
Wonderboy recognizes one of the
greatest strikers in the sport ever.

1615
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:15,920
The only person who got hurt and those
fights was Wonderboy. The same thing with,

1616
01:33:15,921 --> 01:33:19,210
with Darren till Darren tills
a motherfucker on the feet.

1617
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,680
Tyrant shut that shit up quick.
Blam one big right hand drop.

1618
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:26,050
Some beats the fuck out of him
and chokes the shit out of him.

1619
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,460
Well here's the thing man, is
it, you know it's coming to Yup.

1620
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:32,310
Like every like you just can't
prepare for it. It's so fast. Yeah.

1621
01:33:32,311 --> 01:33:35,230
You'd know it's coming. You're like, here
it comes. Here it comes. Oh, there it is.

1622
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,060
Well you got to engage.

1623
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:40,660
And the thing about Tyron too is
he's intelligent and patient. Yeah.

1624
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:43,120
And he'll just,
he'll just hang around on the outside.

1625
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:45,910
He'll hang around the house. Come on.
Yeah. No, you want to do, make a mistake.

1626
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:48,820
Make a mistake, a mistake. The
Wonderboy fights, like you were saying,

1627
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:53,710
all those fights are boring.
You have to fight Wonderboy that way.

1628
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:55,060
Yeah.
How else do you fight them?

1629
01:33:55,061 --> 01:33:57,310
There's not another way to fight him
because it's like another way you're going

1630
01:33:57,311 --> 01:34:00,820
to lose. This is the way to find
them. You have to fight that way.

1631
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,550
If you don't fight that way,
you get fucked up.

1632
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:08,440
If you fight the way you know
fucking Jake Ellenberger yeah,

1633
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,440
yeah. You, you can wheel
kicked in the head. Yeah.

1634
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,460
You fight the way Hendrick's fondom
yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you fucked up. Yeah,

1635
01:34:15,461 --> 01:34:17,980
you gotta fight that way.
You got to stay on the outside.

1636
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:20,530
You can't give into those faints
and he's going to hit you with them.

1637
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:25,330
Little pity paths and tips and taps cause
he's just trying to tag you and touch

1638
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:28,120
you for the big ones
coming in. And he's, he's,

1639
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:32,440
he's elusive and he's clever and
he's a lot quicker than you think.

1640
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:36,160
He also bends at the waist like
a god Damn Kolbe. Yay. Woo.

1641
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:40,600
He's very good at bending at the waist
and then coming back with punches.

1642
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,140
He's a dangerous fighter and Woodley
fought him the perfect way and he did it

1643
01:34:44,141 --> 01:34:47,830
twice. Yeah. And people are like, oh,
that's boring. But that's Wonderboy.

1644
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:50,530
That's what to be exciting.

1645
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:55,150
And you get fucked up or you fight
in a cautious, intelligent way.

1646
01:34:55,390 --> 01:35:00,040
And the fans, boo. See, I see Joe,
I got you all wrong. Oh, sorry.

1647
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:02,430
I thought you hated Tyra.
Why would I hate talking?

1648
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:06,420
I don't know what I'm saying because
like everybody kind of always had hiring

1649
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:10,070
things. Everybody hates time. Yeah.
Maybe we talk now. We never go now.

1650
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:12,820
The Shit I'm talking about
Tyron, it's all positive. We,

1651
01:35:12,821 --> 01:35:15,050
we've never actually talked about it,
but um,

1652
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:20,150
but it just seems like everybody wants to
jump on him no matter what. No. Yeah, no.

1653
01:35:20,151 --> 01:35:24,560
I mean, no, I, I think he's, if he's not
the greatest welterweight of all time,

1654
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:27,410
he's in the running
cause like Matt Hughes,

1655
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,970
I feel like you have to give legend
respect to his. Matt Hughes was the first.

1656
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,270
Matt Hughes was a powerful wrestler.

1657
01:35:35,271 --> 01:35:37,730
That was the first guy
to embrace submissions.

1658
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,000
You only go when Matt Hughes beat George
Saint Pierre and he hit him with that

1659
01:35:41,001 --> 01:35:44,490
far side arm bar. That spirit. Yeah,

1660
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:48,170
that's some high level shit that
we fucked up. Frank Trigg twice.

1661
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,760
It took his back and strangle them.

1662
01:35:49,970 --> 01:35:54,560
Matt Hughes was the first high
level wrestler, tough as shit,

1663
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:59,650
strong as a God damn gorilla who embraced
submissions and he and and did it in a

1664
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:03,650
really intelligent and you know,
effective way. He was like,

1665
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,200
I feel like he was the first day,
so you got to give him his props.

1666
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:07,980
He's the lead legend props.

1667
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:11,390
Then George Saint Pierre is number one
after that because George St Pierre was

1668
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:14,420
the fucking full package.
He could do everything.

1669
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:18,320
He figured out how to beat everybody
and he beat everybody for a long time.

1670
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:22,700
Then this Woodley and I feel like I
look at Woodley and George St Pierre.

1671
01:36:22,701 --> 01:36:26,150
I feel Woodley matches up very well
with George Saint Pierre and I would,

1672
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:29,300
I would have loved to see, I
think Georgia's still, look,

1673
01:36:29,301 --> 01:36:31,280
if you look the way George
looked against Michael Bisping,

1674
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:34,680
he still looks like he's in his
prime and he hasn't, he didn't even,

1675
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,690
he fought very well in that fight and I
think his submissions are probably even

1676
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:42,560
better the way he took Michael
Bisping's back and choked him.

1677
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:45,880
Like motherfuckers still got it. Well,
you know, he's working when Donna her.

1678
01:36:45,881 --> 01:36:49,850
So like that guy is a wizard
wizard. Yeah, that fight.

1679
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,570
I'm very curious to see and I feel like
if George really wanted to come back

1680
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:56,360
with a big challenge and have a,

1681
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:59,780
a big gigantic,
you know,

1682
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:04,810
epic Superfight I feel like Tyron Woodley
a deserves it and B matches up with

1683
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:09,620
him very well. I mean, know, that's
a very interesting fight to me.

1684
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:12,650
The other interesting fight to me with
George has could beep if he could really

1685
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:16,850
get down to 155 pounds, which he says
he can't. That's super interesting.

1686
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:22,130
Yeah. I'll say, what do you think about
George and Ben? I like that too. Yeah,

1687
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:25,960
I like that too. I looked at a luck ban
against, I like Bennigan's could beep.

1688
01:37:26,420 --> 01:37:30,380
Yeah, it got a lot. I liked that
a lot because Ben is bigger,

1689
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:34,910
he's strong as shit and you don't get
better wrestling Katrin credentials now

1690
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:37,460
the problem like what MMA is like,
you get all these fights,

1691
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:40,910
he's like fantasy fights that you want
to make but you can't make them. Yeah.

1692
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:45,530
Because a lot of politics involved,
but at least everybody's under the roof.

1693
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:49,790
Right? Like before it was like when
fader was over in pride like God damn,

1694
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:52,580
I want to get him over here.
I wanted to get him over there so bad.

1695
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:55,830
But that never happened.
You know? And then when he

1696
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,630
finally made it to strike force, he was
kind of, it wasn't the same guy anymore.

1697
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:03,900
He had had some miles on him,
long fights.

1698
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:08,100
Slu didn't look physically the same as
he looked like back when he fought like

1699
01:38:08,101 --> 01:38:12,630
Mirko Cro, cop or Nogueira. I
mean he was a God damn destroyer.

1700
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:15,120
Yeah. I always wanted to
see him fight in the UFC.

1701
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:18,660
I think he could have been UFC champion. I
really do. Yeah. Back in his prime. Yeah,

1702
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:23,350
for sure. Cause he was like the first
dude. It was really like mauling guys.

1703
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,970
He was mauling and like
what his ground and pound.

1704
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:27,150
And that's something that they're like,

1705
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,930
I don't think with the exception of cubby,

1706
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:33,950
nobody else has actually recreated the
type of violence did he put when he got

1707
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:38,190
on top of people,
hurl himself into you and throwing bombs,

1708
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,530
he would fuck people up,
man.

1709
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,860
And it also could catch some missions
in a blink of an eye half his back yet.

1710
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:51,070
And when we fought Randleman random and
sent him flying suplexes and he lands on

1711
01:38:51,121 --> 01:38:51,930
his head,

1712
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:55,560
he lands on his neck and the shoulder
and then seconds later he catches rent.

1713
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:58,710
Randleman Kamora and physics.
He's like, watch this

1714
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:05,760
now. Watch my turn. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Fado was demand like it sucks.

1715
01:39:05,761 --> 01:39:10,761
Like this generation of MMA fans that
we have today don't have that type of

1716
01:39:11,551 --> 01:39:15,870
history. Yeah. And they don't know.
They don't know, like the real fate or,

1717
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:19,620
and they see him now and Bella
tour and just thinking, yeah,

1718
01:39:19,720 --> 01:39:22,410
you're not getting the chance to
see the real faint or you know,

1719
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:27,060
you're not seeing fade or from
the early days, you know. Yeah.

1720
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:32,250
He was, he was so good and he was so
fast too. Yeah. You know what I mean?

1721
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:36,090
He was just everything. He had it up
here. The full package you get smashed,

1722
01:39:36,091 --> 01:39:36,924
you standing up,

1723
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:39,720
he submit you on the ground ground
and pound the fuck out of you.

1724
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:44,010
He could do everything. And he was just
terrifying cause it looks like a robot.

1725
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:47,820
I know. There's no, no
expression, no emotion.

1726
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:52,590
I was with Jeff Munson when Jeff months
and fought him in Russia and when Jeff

1727
01:39:52,591 --> 01:39:57,180
was walking out, it looked like a man
walking to his death. I swear to God.

1728
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:58,590
And then when they fought,

1729
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,020
it was the worst beaten I've ever
seen a human being take. Yeah.

1730
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:04,980
Monson took some beatings to man
and he was getting kicked in.

1731
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:09,180
Like he broke his femur. He was from
getting from lakes. Really? Yeah.

1732
01:40:09,181 --> 01:40:14,160
He was getting kicked in the leg so bad
and just fallen down and oh, it was,

1733
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,920
it was a scary night.
I've felt so bad for,

1734
01:40:16,921 --> 01:40:19,620
Munson is Monson in Russia now,

1735
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:24,510
doesn't he speak Russian and he wants
to be communist does, right? He does.

1736
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:29,400
Um, I'm not sure if that's
the term he would use, but
he's socialists, socialists,

1737
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:33,090
Marxists, whatever he wants to call
himself. But he's in between like Russia,

1738
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:36,750
England,
and south Florida bounces around

1739
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,900
and every so often I'm like,
yeah,

1740
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:43,770
I got a weird fight and I'm fighting
in Russia or I'm fighting in Africa.

1741
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,790
Or like these weird places where
they're fighting or he liked,

1742
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,500
just had like a wrestling
match against like Tim Silvia,

1743
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:54,820
he's doing like all this weird stuff
that no other human being does do.

1744
01:40:54,821 --> 01:40:57,820
When he was at the top of the,
the grappling world,

1745
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,540
he was like wrestling a building.
Yeah. It was like wrestling a building.

1746
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:06,110
He was so jacked, so jacked,
and he was so good. Yeah.

1747
01:41:06,111 --> 01:41:09,540
What he did. But he has a diverse
skillset, but he was sick.

1748
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:12,460
He'd beat everybody to, to nothing.
Yeah. You know when he did,

1749
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:16,930
he also was one of the first guys
to use the north south choke,

1750
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:18,940
but he was so strong.

1751
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:22,360
Like I talked to some Brazilian Jujitsu
guys and I was like, is that legit?

1752
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:26,670
He's like, I think he just gooned
them grab a snack and gooned them.

1753
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:29,710
But then Marcella Garcia started hitting
people with that and then everybody's

1754
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:32,830
like, okay, wait a minute. What's
going on here? What is this guy doing?

1755
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:37,840
And then you realize like, oh you
can, you can get it in the right way,

1756
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:42,520
right? You can north south choke
a real black belt. You can,

1757
01:41:43,260 --> 01:41:46,300
Monson was one of the first guys to
show that, but he's so big and strong.

1758
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,550
He was just, yeah, he would
just like just squeeze it.

1759
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,930
What is sweaty armpit but me,
right. Marcella Garcia. In fact,

1760
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:56,890
Marcella Garcia taught me how he did it
and how he does it and he showed me like

1761
01:41:56,891 --> 01:42:01,060
the finer details of it and I was actually
working with honey Yahya yesterday.

1762
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:03,410
That kind of gets squeezed them
that and I got can squeeze,

1763
01:42:03,411 --> 01:42:06,010
that guy's got to squeeze and he was
doing it to me yesterday too. I was like,

1764
01:42:06,011 --> 01:42:09,280
you've got this. He's weird too
because you look at his body like,

1765
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:13,060
how is that guy a grappler? He doesn't
like if you look at Monson you're like,

1766
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:15,270
oh that guy was here.
Grab our honey. Yah, Yah.

1767
01:42:15,271 --> 01:42:18,190
It looks like a like a kid
who plays soccer. Not even,

1768
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,150
he looks like he's never done
anything athletic in his life.

1769
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,060
Like he's like really?
Yeah, he's like flimsy.

1770
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:28,150
Just gets a hold of grappling ability.
His,

1771
01:42:28,151 --> 01:42:32,650
the way he moves and I think he's a
black belt on her Hixon. Is He really?

1772
01:42:32,651 --> 01:42:35,560
If he's either is either a black belt
on her Hickson or just most certainly

1773
01:42:35,561 --> 01:42:38,650
coached by Hixon cause I remember Hickson
was with him and some of those early

1774
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,790
fights. Ah, he worked with Hickson's.

1775
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:46,570
There was some sort of connection
between him and Hixon, but his, uh,

1776
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,660
his, his strangles in
particular, unbelievable.

1777
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:55,360
So seeing him, I've seen him tap out a
lot of good guys in the gym. I believe it.

1778
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:59,010
A lot of good guys and it's like
they're just different. It just,

1779
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,680
you know what it is. It's not that
they're different. They do it right. Yeah.

1780
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:07,540
You know they do it right. They develop
a skill like whatever it is. You know,

1781
01:43:07,541 --> 01:43:10,840
some guys just have a triangle is
stay the fuck out of his guard.

1782
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:13,350
The guy just has a triangle
that you just can't get it.

1783
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,800
There's certain guys who just get really
proficient at one particular maneuver.

1784
01:43:17,820 --> 01:43:21,610
Yeah. And honey, I was like,
cause just chokes were just nasty.

1785
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:25,930
So I'm working with them now on some
some ground and pound stuff to try to

1786
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,680
incorporate that and see in south
Florida as well as cell phone. Wow.

1787
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,780
South Florida. Goddamn hotbed. Now what
do you think about altitude training?

1788
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:40,750
I mean obviously it has to work,
right? Yeah. I mean I tried it.

1789
01:43:41,050 --> 01:43:43,780
I don't think it worked for me. Maybe I
just didn't believe in it at the time.

1790
01:43:43,781 --> 01:43:47,950
But it has to work because I mean,
I dunno, maybe everybody does it.

1791
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:50,770
So it has to work. It seemed like
it would work scientifically. Right.

1792
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,370
Increases red blood cells

1793
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,550
should work, it should definitely
increase your endurance.

1794
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:58,460
But TJ Dillashaw disagrees really,

1795
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:02,900
and he's got an incredible endurance and
he know he works with that Kalvia guy.

1796
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:08,530
And what was their take is that your
ability to work is compromised when you

1797
01:44:09,171 --> 01:44:10,760
perform and train it out to it.

1798
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:16,370
So even though your body
produces more red blood cells,

1799
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,460
you don't, you're not working
as hard because you just can't,

1800
01:44:19,490 --> 01:44:23,950
there's not enough air. So
the idea is, I've heard the,

1801
01:44:23,951 --> 01:44:28,951
you should train at sea level but
then sleep at high altitude and Tj,

1802
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,570
I believe Tj said that that's not even,

1803
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,280
they don't even think
that's the case anymore.

1804
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:36,860
I think you better off
just with all that air,

1805
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,800
just for recuperation and
just higher work output,

1806
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,760
higher work output and heart rate
monitoring and making sure that, you know,

1807
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:46,090
you're doing like,
like Tabata intervals,

1808
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,510
things like that where you recover and
making sure that all that's monitored,

1809
01:44:49,511 --> 01:44:53,540
that it's done scientifically.
Yeah. I don't know, man.

1810
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:58,040
It's hard to go as hard to go against
Tj because I've never even seen him

1811
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,280
breathe harder to fight.
So incredible. Yeah.

1812
01:45:00,281 --> 01:45:03,050
So like it's hard to go
against what he's saying. Um,

1813
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:06,170
but I kind of liked the idea of that,
you know, I mean, I just, you know,

1814
01:45:06,171 --> 01:45:08,870
I'm kind of an old school guy so I don't
really believe in all the bells and

1815
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:13,130
whistles and gadgets. And I guess
when Tj San is just work harder.

1816
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:16,820
Yeah. Well he, he does
a lot of calisthenics,

1817
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:20,410
a lot of explosive stuff,
a lot of like plyometrics.

1818
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:24,860
And you ever see the shit that he
does down the, in the garage? No,

1819
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:29,810
the guy's names Colivida right
Sam. Yeah. And he's apparently,

1820
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:31,490
I've never worked with a
guy or even talk to him,

1821
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:35,390
but massive respect from so many
different fighters to train with him.

1822
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,510
Aaron Picos down there with,
yeah.

1823
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:40,400
And this guy's just a master of
strength and conditioning looks.

1824
01:45:40,401 --> 01:45:43,600
They're doing a bunch of
this kind of Shit Jumpin uh,

1825
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:48,680
over over a strings and Bob and
weave and under him. And I mean,

1826
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:53,450
and Kalvia is like, got them all wearing
a heart rate, monitors this, this,

1827
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,250
there's no guesswork to the training.

1828
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,580
The training is all really well thought
out and it's all like mostly that kind

1829
01:46:00,581 --> 01:46:05,390
of stuff. Plow metrics, box jumps,
medicine ball work, that kind of shit.

1830
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,980
And you know,

1831
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:12,040
I mean you can't deny that
t J's in phenomenal shape
and that kind of never gets

1832
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:17,090
fat. Never takes time off. Isn't just in
Colorado? No, it's here now. Oh it's hair.

1833
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:22,050
Yeah they're doing, they have a new gym,
they call it the training lab but the,

1834
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:25,280
the word train is,
has the word reign in it.

1835
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:29,750
Like Mark Munoz style like
rain gym. So t, r, e. I n.

1836
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:34,780
Yeah and they put together a gym and so
he's down here now and Dwayne goes back

1837
01:46:35,211 --> 01:46:37,070
and forth from Colorado to here.

1838
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:40,070
Dwayne still as a school in Colorado
and he comes back here to train TJ.

1839
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:45,090
So by who does Tj do work with as
far as skill wise while these hair,

1840
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:47,750
the Munoz and him are doing wrestling,

1841
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:50,310
he's got a bunch of people down
there and punched the Jujitsu people.

1842
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:54,840
And then also like I said, Aaron Peko
is down there. It was very high level.

1843
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:59,010
Bunch of a bunch of different
guys training them and I'm
really interested in to

1844
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:02,760
see how he does at one 25 how his body
does with that massive weight cut.

1845
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:08,520
I mean, and this is the one
thing I like about t j is it?

1846
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:11,100
I don't think he's doing it just because
he feels like he's going to be better

1847
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:13,790
at one 25 things and then he's doing
it because it's a challenge. Yeah.

1848
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:17,940
Because he's also said he's willing to
go up to one 45 to fight Max Holloway.

1849
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:22,890
So I'm kind of rooting for him.
I'd love to see Haley performs at one 25,

1850
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:27,330
you know? Um, he says he can
make it. No problem. Wow,

1851
01:47:27,331 --> 01:47:29,740
that'd be interesting. We so
lean. You look at him now.

1852
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:32,130
He's leaner than he's ever looked before.
I mean shredded now.

1853
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:35,390
He looks like he's ready to weigh in now.
You know what I'm saying? Like, you know,

1854
01:47:35,430 --> 01:47:38,490
guys look so lean when they're weighing
in and then they fill up a little bit

1855
01:47:38,491 --> 01:47:41,220
when they add water. He looks
like that now. Yeah. I mean,

1856
01:47:41,610 --> 01:47:44,910
whether or not he's got two
little body fat, I mean,

1857
01:47:44,911 --> 01:47:47,970
is there a point of diminishing
returns? You know what, that's,

1858
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,460
that's a big question and that's
the way I always see it too.

1859
01:47:50,461 --> 01:47:53,670
Whenever guys cut too much weight, the
returns aren't the same. Like you just,

1860
01:47:53,671 --> 01:47:57,330
you're depleting yourself towards almost
like the same concept is that if you

1861
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:58,950
are so concerned about your weight,

1862
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:03,090
your output as far as like
skilled training and physical
training isn't the same.

1863
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:08,070
Look at them. They're
shredded. That's yesterday

1864
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,830
shredded. Well, look at that.
That's ridiculous. Is He,

1865
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:19,400
is he working with some on his
weight cut or is it just a,

1866
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:22,590
I think Kalvia works with them on
that as well. It works with them.

1867
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:27,000
With the nutrition. I mean that guy is
supposed to be a real mad scientist.

1868
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:31,560
I need to talk to that gentleman and
have been here. But he's um, you know,

1869
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:36,510
this is in the garage to get any
videos them training together.

1870
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:41,130
Yeah. So He's nutritional analysis. Oh,
this is what he has set up for it. Oh,

1871
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:45,270
he's got an APP. Jesus. Jesus. Yeah.

1872
01:48:45,271 --> 01:48:48,840
Become a fat burning machine. Ooh,
I want to be a fat burning machine.

1873
01:48:50,790 --> 01:48:51,960
Virtual training.
Yeah.

1874
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:55,560
I'm interested to see how he performs
against a Soho because Soho has a hard

1875
01:48:55,561 --> 01:48:57,150
time making that weight as well.
Yeah.

1876
01:48:57,690 --> 01:49:01,080
I could imagine that he made him fight
at one 35 for a bit because he kept

1877
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:04,280
missing weight. I mean, I've
seen the sides of his head.
It's a big ball on a Tito.

1878
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:08,310
Yeah. It's got to Tito head, big head.
So it takes a good one. Yeah. You know,

1879
01:49:08,330 --> 01:49:13,290
it was big headed, but he's, you
know, for, um, for a wrestler man,

1880
01:49:13,291 --> 01:49:17,490
like he could box. Yeah. Well
the, uh, Wilson Hayes fine.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

1881
01:49:17,491 --> 01:49:18,850
Any fuck karate style on that,

1882
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:23,610
when you could wrestle that good.

1883
01:49:23,611 --> 01:49:27,220
You can afford to be in any stats you want
because you can always just, you know,

1884
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:31,290
adjust and revert back to your restaurant
position. But yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1885
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,590
But I'm, that's interesting fight
I'm looking for, so that's next week.

1886
01:49:34,591 --> 01:49:38,160
I can't wait til that man. I'm on. That
is next week. It's the 19th, right? Yeah.

1887
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:42,240
Are you going out to that? No, that's
Brooklyn. Yeah, that's a ESPN card.

1888
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:46,440
I'm not doing that one. I only do North
American paper view now. That's it.

1889
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:47,710
Ah,

1890
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,370
big timing. Too busy. Too busy.
Too busy. Yeah. Shows on the road.

1891
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:57,960
I traveled too much as it is and you know,
I don't wanna I don't want to do that.

1892
01:49:58,140 --> 01:50:01,000
I'm not, I don't want to go on Australia
and shit anymore. I love Australia,

1893
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:04,700
but yeah, but you know that fucking,
that wrecks you for two weeks. Yeah.

1894
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,840
I feel you. Yeah. No, I know you got,
I know you'd be, I saw you do, um,

1895
01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:12,690
stand up in Boston. Yeah. I'm just
open for shop. Yeah, it was fun.

1896
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:16,960
Yeah, that was fun. I was proud
of him, man. Shots killing it.

1897
01:50:16,961 --> 01:50:20,530
He's about to do a special, that's
why, where I'm going to be on the 19th,

1898
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:24,550
I'm going to be with him. He's recording
a showtime special done San Diego. Yeah.

1899
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:26,840
Yeah.
Cause I'm like Dan this cause he was like,

1900
01:50:26,841 --> 01:50:30,130
it only done comedy for like a
year or something. Two years now.

1901
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:34,030
Two years over two years. And I saw him
like, it was like a year ago. Maybe not.

1902
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:35,261
Yeah,
maybe a year ago.

1903
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:39,070
And he was like doing comedy for a year
and he had an hour show and it's good.

1904
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:41,890
Yeah. And it was good. Yeah.
And I'm thinking like, you know,

1905
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:46,750
I've dabbled in it for a couple of years
and I got five minutes. Not even I got,

1906
01:50:46,751 --> 01:50:49,120
I got a week five.
He's out there doing it every night.

1907
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,160
Then you gotta do it every night.
I mean,

1908
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:54,400
he's performing with me tonight at
the Improv. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:50:54,401 --> 01:50:57,840
You got to do it every night. It's
like, it's, it's sort of like,

1910
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:01,800
like you can't be good at Jujitsu if
you don't have insurance from rolling.

1911
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,810
Right. You've got a role, you've
got to do comedy all the time.

1912
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:09,160
You got to get in that mind zone. There's
like a US hypnosis, a zone of standup.

1913
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:13,030
Yeah. That same thing Jim Norton told me.
Yeah. But I mean, my whole thing was like,

1914
01:51:13,031 --> 01:51:17,320
I'm not really in love with stand up like
that to go out and want to do it every

1915
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:21,820
night. You gotta love it, grind you and
shit like you bombed the diamond bar.

1916
01:51:21,821 --> 01:51:26,480
You know what that feels
like? Yeah. I was like, damn,

1917
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:30,850
that shit work one time. One
time, not as shit, don't work.

1918
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:32,793
We'll shop.

1919
01:51:32,890 --> 01:51:36,940
Treats it like a professional athlete
and this is one of the things I say to

1920
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:39,520
young comedians when they say,
how's he doing so good so quick,

1921
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:44,350
I won't listen to me. You Lazy. Fuck.
You don't even write. You barely perform.

1922
01:51:44,351 --> 01:51:47,560
You do leave the same five minutes over
and over again night after night without

1923
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:48,760
any improvements.
I go,

1924
01:51:48,761 --> 01:51:51,310
this guy is treating it like a
professional athlete would treat it.

1925
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:55,270
That's the difference is having being
a funny guy already. He's funny.

1926
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:57,670
Having a good mind and
then having discipline,

1927
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:01,990
just discipline where you analyze your
shit and you work on it and you get

1928
01:52:01,991 --> 01:52:06,330
better. It's possible. He's on an
accelerated program. The most accelerated.

1929
01:52:06,331 --> 01:52:09,070
I never heard of anybody doing a
our special two years in. Yeah,

1930
01:52:09,071 --> 01:52:12,430
that's why I was like, damn, he's
killing it. Killing it. Yeah.

1931
01:52:12,431 --> 01:52:16,810
At least he's cool too, man. Like he
responds to my texts and shit like that.

1932
01:52:16,811 --> 01:52:17,880
You know what I'm saying?
Like you know some,

1933
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:22,390
some people you know they'd get all high
big time, big time. He's a great guy.

1934
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:24,700
He like a genuine good person.
Yeah,

1935
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:28,630
you look forward to seeing him succeed
and I like this is like you said,

1936
01:52:28,631 --> 01:52:29,950
it was funny but it was honest.

1937
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:33,430
You know what he's talking about his
career and his life is honest and like a

1938
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:37,570
lot of people aren't willing
to be that vulnerable.

1939
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:41,740
They want to be the cool guy. Yay.
Always trying to be too to cool.

1940
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:46,010
The cool guy has not funny.
It's not funny to be the cool guy so

1941
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,040
that's why like, yes.
Why? Because that lay man,

1942
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:51,560
every batch has to be the cool guy and
he'd get out and get away with that.

1943
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:58,520
All the actors try to be the cool guy or
rappers may be actors and maybe singers

1944
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:02,090
and musicians. Maybe they tried to be
the cool guy but then comedian world,

1945
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:05,680
there's no room for that. You know,
people paid money to hear you talk about,

1946
01:53:05,681 --> 01:53:08,330
I have some funny shit to say.
If you have some funny shit to say,

1947
01:53:08,331 --> 01:53:11,750
but you don't have any funny shit
to say about you. That seems weird.

1948
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,780
It seems weird. Yeah. So you
gotta be kind of Self Katen.

1949
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:21,280
Open it up, open up Pandora's
box. Let's see this,

1950
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:25,610
those zombies. What's in
there? What are the demons?

1951
01:53:25,970 --> 01:53:28,140
Let them out. Let them out. You know,

1952
01:53:28,141 --> 01:53:32,150
you can only do so many specials before
you let the demons out and he might be

1953
01:53:32,151 --> 01:53:36,290
able to get away with one special
making fun of stuff outside of you.

1954
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:40,250
But you gotta you have to have ever,
you have to be able to see everything.

1955
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:42,380
If you're going to be a comedian,
you're going to keep going.

1956
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:46,160
You could be how you're looking at the
world and if how you're looking at the

1957
01:53:46,161 --> 01:53:50,690
world, none of it is reflecting
on you. None of it. Yay. Yeah.

1958
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:54,770
If it's reflecting on you and you're
funny, you gotta be able to be a fool.

1959
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,640
You have to be able to be a fool.
You have to every, every great comic.

1960
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:01,640
Makes fun of themselves.
Yeah. I mean, I so,

1961
01:54:01,641 --> 01:54:06,370
I mean I do more Improv Shit, you know,
mass air always gives me shit for that.

1962
01:54:06,371 --> 01:54:10,030
Cause I hang out with nerds and
fucking Improv Improv troupe.

1963
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:15,250
I do more of that shit. Matt Serra, it
gives you a hard time. Oh my God. Oh,

1964
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:20,810
fucking lemon improv troop.

1965
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:28,340
I'm a theater nerd, man. I hang out
with a little Improv nerds and shit,

1966
01:54:28,341 --> 01:54:32,500
so I do that. But um, but I guess why I
didn't really dig into stand up as much.

1967
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:34,340
I don't know. It was for some
reason I was just like, man,

1968
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:37,460
I don't got time to be going out there
and fucking every night get my fucking

1969
01:54:37,461 --> 01:54:39,630
teeth kicked in buddies.
Yeah.

1970
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:43,320
I know it's necessary and it's
part of the process. Yeah.

1971
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:45,790
But it's not necessarily, if you
don't want to do it, like it's,

1972
01:54:45,791 --> 01:54:49,520
it's not something everybody
should do. Yay. You tried it,

1973
01:54:49,700 --> 01:54:53,330
you didn't like it. And it's not that I
don't like it neither. That's the thing.

1974
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:56,000
It's like I don't mind
it. Yeah. It's just, yeah.

1975
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:59,280
But I feel like if you want to be good
at it and get to the next level, right.

1976
01:54:59,420 --> 01:55:01,960
Did you have to fucking
go through that process?

1977
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:03,980
You would say the same thing to a fighter.

1978
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:05,570
If you had a fighter that was coming in,

1979
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:08,360
like I like to train but I don't
have to train that much. Like don't,

1980
01:55:08,420 --> 01:55:12,110
you're not fighting you gotta
you gotta love this thing.

1981
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:14,270
If you want to be a
professional fighter man,

1982
01:55:14,271 --> 01:55:15,830
do you have to have a singular focus?

1983
01:55:15,831 --> 01:55:19,760
Like you have to be really driven and
dedicated and the difference between that

1984
01:55:19,761 --> 01:55:23,000
is with comedy. Yeah, you
might get your teeth kicked in,

1985
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:28,250
but with fighting you're going to get
your teeth kicked in like really good and

1986
01:55:28,281 --> 01:55:29,900
I'm really fucking banged up.

1987
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:34,970
And you have to be able to suffer almost
every day in order to get yourself into

1988
01:55:34,971 --> 01:55:38,510
kind of condition that you need to
be in to fight. You need to have,

1989
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:42,380
there's a level of discipline that you
need to have to be a professional fighter

1990
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:44,280
that's almost unequaled in sports.

1991
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:49,670
Yeah. Cause, I mean it can like that
because it's not just discipline like you,

1992
01:55:49,671 --> 01:55:50,820
you have to have great discipline.

1993
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:54,180
If you want to be a runner and you
want to be a marathon runner or a great

1994
01:55:54,181 --> 01:55:54,511
discipline,

1995
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:58,050
if you want to be a professional football
player or a professional basketball

1996
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:01,740
player, but the difference
between fighting is you have
to have great discipline,

1997
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,320
but you also are going to get fucked up.

1998
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:06,960
You're also going to get
your face punched in.

1999
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:10,450
You're gonna get your liver kicked, you
know you're gonna get a LIMS pulled. Yeah.

2000
01:56:10,750 --> 01:56:15,570
You going to get your legs thumped with
shins slamming into the meatier leg

2001
01:56:15,571 --> 01:56:20,310
where everything goes numb. Oh,
don't remind me. Thump and arm.

2002
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:24,390
I don't do that shit no more.
I don't do that shit no more.

2003
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:25,740
Do your legs go back to normal,

2004
01:56:25,741 --> 01:56:27,990
to the point where you don't feel
like you could take it anymore.

2005
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:31,860
I can't take kicks no more. Isn't that
a weird thing? Like he did develop,

2006
01:56:31,861 --> 01:56:33,630
I could ability to absorb those.

2007
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:36,510
Like if you watch like Robert van but
reus smiling or something like that.

2008
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:40,110
Robin van Moose Mile and look,
I'll take a leg kick and it's like,

2009
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:44,370
it doesn't even seem to affect him, but
when you stop doing it, you can't go back.

2010
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:48,210
Right. I mean do you you spa
around a little bit? No. Yeah.

2011
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,110
No I haven't kickbox Barden forever.
I was,

2012
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:56,570
I just think like getting hit in the
head should be something that you should

2013
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,560
decide. Okay. No more of that.

2014
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:01,890
Like this should be a time where like
you could spar Jujitsu and you can keep

2015
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:03,140
going pretty much forever.
I mean,

2016
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:08,240
Leo was sparring when he
was in his nineties he was
still rolling but striking.

2017
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:12,840
It's like at a certain point in time
you got to stop. Yeah, I don't do it,

2018
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:17,130
eh? Yeah. I barely, I mean honestly
I barely role to be honest with you.

2019
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:19,650
Like I just study,
study,

2020
01:57:20,060 --> 01:57:22,710
study to gain work out a little bit.
Like,

2021
01:57:22,711 --> 01:57:26,260
I mean I still have to roll at times
to drive the kind of workouts. Do you

2022
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:32,430
guys know that happens? A lot of fighters,
they stop fighting and they see, I mean,

2023
01:57:32,431 --> 01:57:35,130
he spent so many years like
running and doing all this stuff.

2024
01:57:35,131 --> 01:57:37,140
Like when you're done,
like the last thing you want to do is run.

2025
01:57:37,320 --> 01:57:39,720
If that like Tyron Woodley, we going
to camp and I said, hey listen,

2026
01:57:40,050 --> 01:57:43,560
you got to buy me a bike if you want me
to go alongside of you by your running.

2027
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:45,820
I ain't running with joy ass.

2028
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:51,720
It's gotta be hard for him to
run too. Cause he's so thick.
Yeah. Yeah. He's, I mean,

2029
01:57:51,721 --> 01:57:53,730
he hates running,
but like I think that part of,

2030
01:57:53,790 --> 01:57:57,330
part of that motivates him to go to smoke.
Fucking made me run fucking him up.

2031
01:57:57,440 --> 01:58:00,930
Yeah. So he, but yeah, so it's tiring now.

2032
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:05,370
35 35 maybe 36 how many more years
do you think he's kind of left?

2033
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:10,470
Hey, be bullshitting. He be like, yeah,
another three years. I don't think so.

2034
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,520
You know his rap career about to take off.
So you think so? I don't know. I mean,

2035
01:58:14,521 --> 01:58:17,730
you know, I mean, he's such, he's
the most hustling guy I've ever met.

2036
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:21,600
He's always on TMZ. He hustles. He
always doing something. The castles.

2037
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:26,190
So does he have a podcast? Well, me and
him had one together, but we got one now.

2038
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:31,140
Yeah. But we don't have a record
because he'd be, what is it?

2039
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:34,940
What's it called? It's uh, it's the,
it's the morning wood. Oh, okay.

2040
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,850
I've heard of that before. So, but we, we
ain't recorded in like a year. Oh, well.

2041
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,980
So he'll really have
inconsistent consistent

2042
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:45,790
to say the least. That's the
number one thing about podcasts.

2043
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:48,480
You've gotta be consistent. Well,
yeah, so like I do one now with, uh,

2044
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:52,240
with Tj to San has called the beat down
and like, and I'm like, dude, wait,

2045
01:58:52,241 --> 01:58:54,060
let's record. We've got to
record. Because like you said,

2046
01:58:54,061 --> 01:58:57,820
consistency is key to everything.
There's too many out there.

2047
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:01,460
People get bored with you. Yeah. If you
don't, if you don't give them call like,

2048
01:59:01,461 --> 01:59:03,190
you gotta make them addicted.

2049
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:07,180
And the only way to make them addicted
is you got to first of all be addicted.

2050
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,140
You gotta be enjoying all these
conversations because it's the,

2051
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:15,100
it's the only way that it is, um, that
it's contagious. There's no other way.

2052
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:17,050
Like if you're half asking or faking it,

2053
01:59:17,051 --> 01:59:18,490
you really don't want
to talk to these people.

2054
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:22,660
Then that comes through people's
ears. They hear that, you know,

2055
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:25,610
like I always love talking
to people. I like, I'm,

2056
01:59:25,650 --> 01:59:29,170
I've always been like when I was in the
brief amount of time I was in college,

2057
01:59:29,171 --> 01:59:31,960
the only thing that interests
me with psychology. Really?
Yeah, I was interested.

2058
01:59:31,961 --> 01:59:34,150
I W W because I knew my own mind.

2059
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:38,260
Like I got into psychology because I'm
the same reason why I got into philosophy

2060
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,260
because I was scared, scared of fighting.
I was like, what's wrong with my brain?

2061
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:43,300
Like why am I was scared like why am I,

2062
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:45,970
why am I scared before every tournament
and scared before all these different

2063
01:59:45,971 --> 01:59:48,310
things. Like what? And then I
realize everybody's scared. Okay,

2064
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:52,080
well how do people manage that? Like what?
What did, is there a right way to think?

2065
01:59:52,130 --> 01:59:54,880
Cause I knew that sometimes I would go
in there with a perfect mindset and I'd

2066
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:57,040
win that feel great and
then I couldn't recreate it.

2067
01:59:57,041 --> 01:59:59,770
Like two weeks later I'm like,
well what the fuck is wrong with my head?

2068
01:59:59,950 --> 02:00:01,000
How do I figure this out?

2069
02:00:01,270 --> 02:00:05,530
So I was wanting to talk to people
and find out like what makes you tick?

2070
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:08,290
Like what, what, what, what
motivates you? How do you,

2071
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:09,850
how do you discipline yourself?

2072
02:00:09,851 --> 02:00:11,740
Like what are you thinking about
when you're pushing yourself?

2073
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,450
Like what are you thinking
about when you're calm?

2074
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:15,400
Do you spend time reflecting on your work?

2075
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:19,130
Do you just keep going and keep doing
it or do you analyze it? Like what,

2076
02:00:19,140 --> 02:00:21,760
what is happening with you?
Like what do you do? And then,

2077
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:24,640
so a podcast to me almost came
naturally because I'm always,

2078
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:28,060
I'm always talking to people and
I'm always trying to do, I want to,

2079
02:00:28,061 --> 02:00:31,450
I was trying to like get behind the
doors of the eyes, like what's in there.

2080
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:34,840
But that's said Jim Norton said
that about you too. He's like,

2081
02:00:34,841 --> 02:00:37,240
it's a great conversation.
Lessons. It's blinking and shit.

2082
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:45,400
Well, I'm curious, I'm like, I don't
want to just talk. I want to, I want to,

2083
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:46,630
I want to hear people,

2084
02:00:46,631 --> 02:00:50,080
like sometimes comedians are just waiting
for their turn to talk and they're not

2085
02:00:50,081 --> 02:00:51,510
listening to you.
Like,

2086
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:56,710
I've always tried very hard to listen
to people and trying to like see what,

2087
02:00:56,740 --> 02:01:01,480
where they're coming from, trying to get
into their head. So let me ask you this.

2088
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:05,450
Did you ever figure it out?
But, uh, why you couldn't, uh,

2089
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:08,970
manage wow. Those emotions.
Yeah. I was young. First of all,

2090
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:10,960
I stopped fighting when I was 21 or 22,

2091
02:01:10,961 --> 02:01:15,730
somewhere in that range
between 21 and 22. Um, I, um,

2092
02:01:15,790 --> 02:01:18,370
there was also no future.
That was a problem too.

2093
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:20,920
It wasn't like I was working towards
something when I was fighting.

2094
02:01:20,921 --> 02:01:24,280
It was stopped in 88,
89 I think.

2095
02:01:24,281 --> 02:01:28,030
Maybe I had my last kickboxing
fights and there was no,

2096
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,560
there was no future. There was no
nowhere to go. Like kickboxing,

2097
02:01:32,561 --> 02:01:35,680
you got like $500 for a fight.
You get your brains punched in.

2098
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,250
There was no money in taekwondo. And then
the Olympic scoring system, the Olympics

2099
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,640
were incredibly corrupt.
Like the scoring was terrible,

2100
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:46,460
especially if you fought
a Korean, Oh, good Lord.

2101
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:50,090
And not window and not winning at
a beat the living fuck out of them.

2102
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:53,690
In order to Orient to stop them,
had a k o them. And then, um,

2103
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:57,440
I was also seeing brain
damage. I was seeing people
in the gym with brain damage,

2104
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:00,620
especially when I started kickboxing
because I was spending a lot of time in

2105
02:02:00,621 --> 02:02:01,454
boxing gyms.

2106
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:07,240
I've seen guys that were slurring and
stuttering their words and they just acted

2107
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:10,710
weird. And you see guys that
acted different after a Kol,

2108
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,270
they got KOD and then you see them
just a little bit more distant,

2109
02:02:14,540 --> 02:02:18,620
a little bit more glassy eyed and slack
jaw and you're like, oh Jesus Christ.

2110
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:21,500
Like you see it. Yeah. I
mean, I hate it, man. It,

2111
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:25,710
it breaks my heart every time I see a
guy take unnecessary punishment. Yeah.

2112
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:26,631
And not even,

2113
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:29,690
even if he's not slur of just like taking
unnecessary punishment as you know,

2114
02:02:29,691 --> 02:02:30,260
where it leads,

2115
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:33,980
I know where it leads and it really
breaks my heart when I see like the fans,

2116
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:38,960
like expect it from fighters. Yeah. They,

2117
02:02:38,961 --> 02:02:42,380
um, you know, they don't know what
they're watching. You know, they're just,

2118
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:45,590
they're just watching violence that it's
almost like it's not really their, yeah.

2119
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,400
It's not really happening. They don't,
they don't know what it's like. Yeah.

2120
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:52,610
Where the guy gets knocked out. And then,
because if for them it's over, they just,

2121
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:55,610
you know, they going back to
the regular life. But for me,

2122
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:59,810
I'm going to the hospital with this
motherfucker got knocked out and he's got

2123
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,630
his fucking eyes,
you know,

2124
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:06,670
busted open and he's all busted up orbital
bone and, and for the next, you know,

2125
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:07,880
three or four months,
you know,

2126
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:12,560
this guy's depressed because he was trying
to cater to the fans and put on this

2127
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:16,460
exciting fight and yet he
then went through all this
punishment and that's just

2128
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:19,880
then, and then if you do
that, have a career of that,
you're going to be fucked up.

2129
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:24,440
Yeah. There's no, I
don't like it. You know,

2130
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:26,480
it's, uh, it's just,

2131
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:30,500
it's hard when guys don't know how to
get out or where to go when they get out.

2132
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:34,010
And this hard, when you see them
knowing that they have to get out,

2133
02:03:34,011 --> 02:03:38,690
but they're still fighting. Oh yeah.
That's the worst man. I'm always like,

2134
02:03:38,691 --> 02:03:42,650
damn, what do you do when you have
a fighter that you know should stop?

2135
02:03:43,370 --> 02:03:47,810
I'm pretty honest with them. I'm always
honest. I'm always like, man, listen,

2136
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:52,250
this ain't for you no more.
And I always have to tell them like if I,

2137
02:03:52,251 --> 02:03:55,840
if I feel like it's going to affect
them physically and hurt them,

2138
02:03:55,841 --> 02:03:58,340
but by continuing to fight, I
tell them, hey, you need to stop.

2139
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:00,590
And more often than not,
they kind of listened.

2140
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:03,410
They probably kind of know where they
kind of know and they just needed somebody

2141
02:04:03,411 --> 02:04:06,740
else to say it. And I'm more willing to
tell them. I always try to tell them,

2142
02:04:06,741 --> 02:04:11,030
but sometimes if they don't want to do it,
then I can't really be a part of it.

2143
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:15,740
Like when you saw Tito versus
chuck? Yeah, that's one of the,

2144
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:20,690
my opinion.
And no disrespect to chuck,

2145
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:25,400
he should do whatever he
wants to do. Maybe he enjoys
it, maybe wants to compete.

2146
02:04:25,401 --> 02:04:30,360
But that was one of the worst examples
of a guy who used to be a fuck and a

2147
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:34,710
stroller. Chuck was a district. Hello?

2148
02:04:35,170 --> 02:04:38,970
Oh man, dude. Randleman CalEd Randleman

2149
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:41,640
failed everybody. He was
out. He was a killer.

2150
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:47,070
Chuck was a straight up
killer and watching him fight
fucking Palae Landy bare

2151
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:50,880
knuckle in Brazil. Yeah. When
they had the net and the ropes,

2152
02:04:50,881 --> 02:04:55,200
he had knocked down with three times with
head kicks and still pay Paleo. Yeah,

2153
02:04:55,201 --> 02:04:59,010
man, that's, yeah. And then the
watch him and then again another,

2154
02:04:59,011 --> 02:05:02,940
another cases scenario where like young
fighters see him and go on his old guy.

2155
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:05,700
Yeah. But he shouldn't be fighting. Yeah.

2156
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:10,290
You shouldn't be fine at 50 and he
clearly can't take a punch anymore.

2157
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:13,500
She like whatever it is.
Like when Tito connected on him,

2158
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:16,440
everything just shut off.
Yeah. You see it just shut off.

2159
02:05:16,441 --> 02:05:19,050
And then Tito smashes him
and we tell him about Tito.

2160
02:05:19,051 --> 02:05:22,800
We're not exactly talking about
fucking Anthony Johnson. That's true.

2161
02:05:22,801 --> 02:05:26,230
But I think Tito's punches are a lot
better than they used to be. Yeah.

2162
02:05:26,270 --> 02:05:30,300
And I think Perillo Jason Parillo is a
fantastic coach and I think he did an

2163
02:05:30,301 --> 02:05:34,500
amazing job. And I think Tito, you
know, he's just not a natural Stryker.

2164
02:05:34,501 --> 02:05:38,700
It's not like his thing. He's
a wrestler, but it's the way,

2165
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:41,820
the way it happened. It
just, chuck couldn't connect.

2166
02:05:41,950 --> 02:05:46,500
He is like everything
looked off his timing,

2167
02:05:46,501 --> 02:05:49,560
his movement, he just looked,
is balanced, looked off.

2168
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:55,280
And when you talk to people that are
neuroscientists and they understand what

2169
02:05:55,741 --> 02:06:00,050
happens to the brain after repeated brain
trauma over and over and over again,

2170
02:06:00,051 --> 02:06:03,150
and then what we're seeing
is just in the cage.

2171
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:07,130
We don't have no idea how much brain
trauma he took in camps and it's probably

2172
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:11,400
pretty magnificant. Yeah, I
would assume his style was so,

2173
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:15,870
he's such a brawler and he had an iron
chin for the beginning of his career.

2174
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:20,160
It was, it just one of the greatest
chins of all time. So when it failed him,

2175
02:06:20,190 --> 02:06:24,840
there was no, there was no escape
clause. There was no, there was no way.

2176
02:06:24,841 --> 02:06:27,800
There was no back door. This
was the style. The style wasn't.

2177
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,270
All of a sudden you're going to be like
mighty mouse and not get hit and switch

2178
02:06:30,271 --> 02:06:34,170
stances and become slick.
That shit is just not available.

2179
02:06:34,680 --> 02:06:39,120
And when you saw him with
this hampered movement,

2180
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,710
he just doesn't,
is balanced doesn't seem right.

2181
02:06:41,730 --> 02:06:45,150
Like I was watching him hit the
pads when they were preparing,

2182
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,310
when he's getting ready, I was
watching hit the pass. I was like,

2183
02:06:47,311 --> 02:06:50,910
what is happening here?
Because balance looks fucked up.

2184
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:52,500
Like it didn't look right.

2185
02:06:52,860 --> 02:06:56,640
Like even when he's throwing kicks he
like threw a kick and then fall back like

2186
02:06:56,641 --> 02:07:01,410
it didn't look right. We have what I
mean. And I feel that even with myself,

2187
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:04,720
like I don't have the same
balance I had when I was 20 right.

2188
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:09,270
And I could imagine him
like, cause he probably never
even focused on that. Right.

2189
02:07:09,570 --> 02:07:11,670
He just did it. He just, he
was just throwing punches.

2190
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:16,950
So for him that like I watch a video of
him shadow boxing, horrendous, rough,

2191
02:07:16,980 --> 02:07:20,400
horrendous. But then you go back
and watch him when he was the champ.

2192
02:07:20,401 --> 02:07:22,920
It's like Jesus Christ. Hey, harder. No,

2193
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:26,760
I watched him hit the bag and he's
like a fucking murderer. He had speech,

2194
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:29,970
our power,
everything,

2195
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:33,420
putting it together and just
that style. Just a, I mean,

2196
02:07:33,421 --> 02:07:35,070
the reason why he became
such a fan favorite,

2197
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:38,020
you knew chuck Liddell was
coming to kill you. I mean,

2198
02:07:38,021 --> 02:07:42,610
he was coming to kill you and that cage
door shut and they said, let's get it on.

2199
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:47,200
He just stepped forward and just looking
at smash. And that was his style.

2200
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:49,900
And it was the reason why
the UFC became so famous.

2201
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:54,190
One of the big reasons why the UFC
became so popular with chocolate Dell,

2202
02:07:55,480 --> 02:07:58,360
he was a guy who everybody
could identify with. Yeah.

2203
02:07:58,810 --> 02:08:03,810
And the fan base at a UFC saw
themselves in chuck Liddell will,

2204
02:08:04,451 --> 02:08:06,280
they wished the wished
that could be that guy

2205
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:11,260
to save had the Mohawk.
The Tattoo was fearless,

2206
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:15,030
was knocking people out and
it scream afterwards. Yeah.

2207
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:18,550
It's like they saw what they saw it.
I said, I won't be that guy. Yeah.

2208
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:23,490
And you're right. And that's how the UFC
became so popular so fast. As with Joe,

2209
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:27,400
when you see him now at 50 fighting
the way fought against Tito,

2210
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:31,030
you're like so hard to watch.
But then the other hand it's like,

2211
02:08:31,031 --> 02:08:33,400
I don't want to tell the guy what to do.
He's not going to live forever.

2212
02:08:33,890 --> 02:08:37,140
Like if this is what he really enjoys
and he wants to do that, I mean,

2213
02:08:37,141 --> 02:08:39,730
and maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea
in the world for him to keep going.

2214
02:08:39,731 --> 02:08:43,600
I don't know. I don't know. I'm
not, his dad got him, you know,

2215
02:08:43,601 --> 02:08:45,430
I don't know what to tell
him. I mean, it also,

2216
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:47,800
you got to think like he
probably does worst thing.

2217
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:48,680
He's in his life and

2218
02:08:50,240 --> 02:08:55,120
then getting in the cage with an old
buddy. You know? You think so probably.

2219
02:08:56,330 --> 02:09:01,060
I mean, I never hung out with the dude,
but I'm just saying you heard stories?

2220
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:02,643
Yeah.

2221
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:05,340
Yeah. Well you does.
Hanging out at the church.

2222
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:09,500
He definitely did his share of partying.
Yeah. Which doesn't help. Yeah. Yeah.

2223
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:12,750
Depending upon what your
partying with too, you know,

2224
02:09:12,751 --> 02:09:15,540
I'm sure there's certain substances that
are worse than others when it comes to

2225
02:09:15,541 --> 02:09:16,374
your brain.

2226
02:09:18,380 --> 02:09:19,950
See,
that's why I can't ever live in La.

2227
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:25,290
I'm staying my ass in Florida.
Well, what's in Florida?

2228
02:09:25,291 --> 02:09:29,600
It's the cocaine capital of the world. I
know, man, but I'm not as much access. He,

2229
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:31,560
yeah.
I don't know.

2230
02:09:31,561 --> 02:09:36,010
The party scene just seems it's not
the same as Florida fucking Florida,

2231
02:09:36,011 --> 02:09:40,560
if not of Miami's got to have the craziest
party scene on the planet and you can

2232
02:09:40,561 --> 02:09:41,430
stay away from that though.

2233
02:09:42,020 --> 02:09:45,890
Yeah. Well you can because of the gym
and hanging around with the right people,

2234
02:09:45,891 --> 02:09:50,540
but whenever I'm down in Miami, I'm like,
this is the most chaotic place ever.

2235
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:55,220
Yeah. Miami, like I never go to Miami.
I don't ever go down there. Really?

2236
02:09:55,310 --> 02:09:59,240
Yeah, it's fun place. Last time
I did a gig there though, I was,

2237
02:09:59,241 --> 02:10:01,700
it was right before I was
filming my Netflix special,

2238
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:06,800
and so we have these yonder bags. Yonder
is a cell phone bag that they use. Well,

2239
02:10:06,801 --> 02:10:10,520
you have to put yourself
on this magnetically sealed
bag to get into the room

2240
02:10:10,730 --> 02:10:12,830
and the only way to use your phone
as you got to leave the room,

2241
02:10:12,831 --> 02:10:14,420
they opened the bag for you.
They give you your phone,

2242
02:10:14,421 --> 02:10:17,030
you hold onto your phone the whole time.
You have possession of it,

2243
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:20,630
but it's sealed in this bad key people
from texting and filming and all that

2244
02:10:20,631 --> 02:10:23,450
kind of shit while the show's
going on every other place.

2245
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:26,180
It accentuated the show because it made,

2246
02:10:26,240 --> 02:10:28,850
it made the show like 10% better
because people were just focused.

2247
02:10:28,970 --> 02:10:32,240
They weren't staring at their phone.
They're just focused at the show in Miami,

2248
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:34,010
all people kept doing is just getting up

2249
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:38,570
to go outside, do use their
phone. It was like the, no,

2250
02:10:38,571 --> 02:10:41,710
it sat down on the wholesale then
pop it up and move and pop up.

2251
02:10:41,711 --> 02:10:43,400
Just made it worse.
It made it worse.

2252
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:47,360
Put like when Tiffany Haddish,
she just bombed in Miami.

2253
02:10:47,380 --> 02:10:50,580
It was like this big TMZ deal that
she bombed there. I'm like, yeah,

2254
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:55,010
in Miami you got to grab those
motherfuckers. You got to go, hey,

2255
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:56,150
here's the show.

2256
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:57,760
What I did,
I tell you know,

2257
02:10:57,800 --> 02:11:02,210
south Florida is probably the
most unfocused place on earth.

2258
02:11:02,360 --> 02:11:07,100
Like nobody's focused on
anything. Nothing. I said, if
you want to starve to death,

2259
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:11,180
open a bookstore in Miami.
Yeah, that's true, man.

2260
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:14,150
People Miami, like they
don't, they don't have no,

2261
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:15,910
they don't have no football team.
They got the dolphins,

2262
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:19,160
but Dane Tam dealt Miami Dolphins.
They pay, they'll pay attention,

2263
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:21,020
pay attention to the Florida Marlins.

2264
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:26,240
Nothing but having fun and partying and
that's all they want to do. Fuck. Yup.

2265
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:30,540
That's all they do. Like on South
Beach. It's great for that. Yeah.

2266
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:31,940
That's your sport.
Yeah.

2267
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:36,140
But for him to dancing and
fucking Miami is the place to be.

2268
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:40,790
They got great food in Miami.
Great food, great food. Yeah.

2269
02:11:40,820 --> 02:11:43,730
Fantastic. Cuban buddy. Yeah. Cuba
food. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

2270
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,050
There's some great restaurants in Miami.

2271
02:11:45,130 --> 02:11:48,220
Bunch of great restaurants.
Yeah. I mean it's a great spot.

2272
02:11:48,310 --> 02:11:51,040
It's just not the best spot for everything

2273
02:11:53,080 --> 02:11:58,080
other than it's not best buy for anything
other than partying and fucking party

2274
02:11:58,341 --> 02:12:02,400
to fucking and apparently
and eating Cuban food.

2275
02:12:02,460 --> 02:12:04,190
You ever watched those documentaries on

2276
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:07,500
uh, on a cocaine, the cocaine
cowboys document I've seen.

2277
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:11,220
Oh, Dan, you're going to be so happy.

2278
02:12:11,790 --> 02:12:14,820
You got to watch these
cocaine cowboys one and two.

2279
02:12:14,821 --> 02:12:16,930
There are some of the greatest
fucking document and you,

2280
02:12:16,931 --> 02:12:21,930
you're going to realize why
Miami is so fucking bananas.

2281
02:12:22,290 --> 02:12:24,570
The amount of cocaine
that went through Miami,

2282
02:12:24,720 --> 02:12:26,700
they said that at one point in time,
I don't know if that's still the case,

2283
02:12:26,701 --> 02:12:30,930
but at one point time Miami had more
banks per capita than anywhere else in the

2284
02:12:30,931 --> 02:12:34,680
continent and it's all because the
cocaine money was being laundered through

2285
02:12:34,681 --> 02:12:39,450
Miami. These areas, 100% there was,
this is all Billy Corbin's documentary.

2286
02:12:39,451 --> 02:12:43,410
He's got two documentaries, fantastic
documentaries, cocaine cowboys wanting to,

2287
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:48,870
but one of the things that it talked
about is one year every single member of

2288
02:12:48,871 --> 02:12:53,871
the graduating class of the police academy
either was murdered or went to jail

2289
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:58,710
every single member. Dot. Entire
Police Academy. It was corrupt.

2290
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:03,660
They were all deeply involved in the
drug game. Yeah, yeah. It was chaos.

2291
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:04,481
It was chaos.

2292
02:13:04,481 --> 02:13:07,470
It was just people were making
millions of dollars in burring holes,

2293
02:13:07,530 --> 02:13:09,510
be putting bags of it in their backyard,

2294
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:13,130
just digging holes in the backyard
and drop in fucking big ole sack,

2295
02:13:13,131 --> 02:13:16,560
some money in there. Are you sick
garbage bags filled with cash? Yeah,

2296
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:17,610
probably still out there,

2297
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:22,380
but probably guys died and there's garbage
bags filled with cash that they left

2298
02:13:22,381 --> 02:13:26,730
in their backyard. They forgot
about it because they got
shot. Oh yeah, it's there.

2299
02:13:26,731 --> 02:13:28,520
Great documentaries, but
I need to find out. Right.

2300
02:13:28,680 --> 02:13:29,513
They lived.

2301
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:36,350
I'm going digging shovel by some sketchy
looking at houses and start digging in

2302
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:40,830
the backyard. Oh my God. I didn't
know it was that crazy. So crazy.

2303
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:43,380
I didn't know it was that
crazy. He's until I watched
all the documentaries. It's,

2304
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:48,000
there's so good. Probably if I had a top
10 list of documentaries of all time,

2305
02:13:48,120 --> 02:13:51,420
cocaine cowboys is on
there. That good. No Shit.

2306
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:56,160
100% must watch. Yeah. Especially
if it's on Netflix. Right?

2307
02:13:56,310 --> 02:14:00,300
I'm sure you don't dent flicks.
Cocaine cowboys. Certainly on iTunes.

2308
02:14:01,050 --> 02:14:05,240
It's so good. You just go, oh
my God. It's like you shut up.

2309
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:10,470
You don't know about Grizelda. Who says
held a Blanco? She's this pitch that was,

2310
02:14:10,770 --> 02:14:14,940
she was running everything back then.
It was a woman and a woman,

2311
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:18,570
evil woman that was running everything.
Murderer.

2312
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:23,700
Just a straight killer hired all
these savages. Just gun people down.

2313
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:27,960
Babies, women, children,
everybody dead. Dead.

2314
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:32,640
Ruthless. Yeah. So what happened to
her? She still, she's dead. She went,

2315
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:36,780
she went to a jail in Columbia and uh,
she got out.

2316
02:14:37,290 --> 02:14:40,620
They let her out. There was pictures of
her with her girlfriend. She was like,

2317
02:14:40,621 --> 02:14:42,450
sometimes she was a lesbian,
sometimes she wasn't.

2318
02:14:42,690 --> 02:14:46,080
But there was a pictures of her with
her girlfriend and Bogota after she got

2319
02:14:46,081 --> 02:14:46,501
released.

2320
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:50,010
Like that lady is responsible
for the death of who knows
how many fucking people,

2321
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:55,080
millions of dollars moved
around in money. Yeah. Yeah man,

2322
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:59,820
it's a fucking Dick. Great documentaries.
Great Shit. Can't recommend them enough.

2323
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:03,420
Oh yeah. I got to see this. You
got to see it. Yeah. You're gonna,

2324
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:08,340
you're gonna text me afterwards even
go, oh shit. I had no idea that, I mean,

2325
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:12,480
I knew Miami was bad. I mean obviously I
get so close to, you know, South America,

2326
02:15:12,481 --> 02:15:14,070
so I'm sure that's Kinda gotta be a hub.

2327
02:15:14,071 --> 02:15:17,490
But I didn't know it was like Jennifer
Lopez is playing her in a movie,

2328
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:22,510
isn't she? Did that movie came out? No,

2329
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,350
it was like it might,
it didn't.

2330
02:15:24,380 --> 02:15:27,950
Maybe they didn't make it really or
maybe not yet. She's too hot. Who?

2331
02:15:27,951 --> 02:15:31,350
Jennifer Lopez to play this girl.
This girl wasn't costing. Oh really?

2332
02:15:32,150 --> 02:15:34,580
Well how is she going to get
some Joey Diaz with a wig on?

2333
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:42,350
She was evil man.
Super Evil.

2334
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:45,340
It's just interesting with a whole crime
syndicate run by a woman, you know,

2335
02:15:45,350 --> 02:15:49,170
cause you like see that in the movie
in a movie. The fuck out of here? No,

2336
02:15:49,190 --> 02:15:54,180
this is happening for real cause all the
Blanco. Yeah. Damn put on power though.

2337
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:57,690
She killed everybody at 2016
she was labeled with it.

2338
02:15:57,691 --> 02:16:01,610
But then 2017 there's article saying
that Catherine Zeta Jones and her work

2339
02:16:01,611 --> 02:16:06,480
competing for it. Oh, but it's an HBO
TV movie that has yet to be made. So

2340
02:16:08,370 --> 02:16:11,610
pull up a picture of her.
The real Griselda Blanco.

2341
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:16,380
I'm telling you too much. You need
to watch it. Just need to watch it.

2342
02:16:16,670 --> 02:16:19,830
There she is right there. Joey Diaz.
What are were gone. Yeah, it is.

2343
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:22,240
See how has the,
that's how I would make up.

2344
02:16:22,620 --> 02:16:25,410
Imagine where she looks like in the
morning. We're just taking a shit. Yeah.

2345
02:16:25,411 --> 02:16:29,770
That was her boyfriend.
Yeah.

2346
02:16:29,771 --> 02:16:32,300
He got in trouble because he was
banging some chicks while she was, uh,

2347
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:35,040
in the pokey. Can you
blame him? Nope. Nope.

2348
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:40,000
Look at her evil damn evil evil.

2349
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:41,970
They talked to her hit man.

2350
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:45,790
Her hitman gets interviewed in the
movie from jail and like, you know,

2351
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:50,140
talk about like what the
rules were and how she,

2352
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:51,250
how she ran things.

2353
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:56,740
The amount of money that those people
made is just ungodly sums of money and

2354
02:16:56,741 --> 02:17:00,400
nobody knew how to get out. It was like
once that money's flowing and you know,

2355
02:17:00,401 --> 02:17:03,190
you're making $30 million a week
or whatever the fuck you're making.

2356
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:06,470
Like when do you get out? When, when
you get out, how do you get out? Yeah.

2357
02:17:06,471 --> 02:17:09,580
You can't get out of that. And if you
do get out, like who takes over? Yeah.

2358
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:12,820
Who takes over the distribution and then
everybody I think probably just says,

2359
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:16,240
AH, next year. Yeah, next year.
This is my last year doing this.

2360
02:17:16,310 --> 02:17:21,220
Then the match to catch bullets. The only
way out is death. Yeah. I have a friend,

2361
02:17:21,221 --> 02:17:24,250
a very good friend. My friend
Steve Graham, who did his right,

2362
02:17:24,280 --> 02:17:25,180
he's an ophthalmologist.

2363
02:17:25,181 --> 02:17:30,181
He did his residency in Miami and was
doing his residency in the emergency room

2364
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:34,180
in Miami while the cocaine
days were going on.

2365
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:39,150
He said every day just blown up.
Heads, bullet holes, cocaine,

2366
02:17:39,210 --> 02:17:42,490
the godmother review stuff.
They made it brown face casting.

2367
02:17:42,491 --> 02:17:46,390
It's just one of many insults. And this
Schlocky Narchos rip off. What? Oh,

2368
02:17:46,391 --> 02:17:49,070
that is brown face.
Look at that.

2369
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:52,000
That lady's supposed to be
resolved to block out Zeta Jones.

2370
02:17:53,330 --> 02:17:55,980
That's not Catherine Zeta.
Yeah. Jones is it? Yeah,

2371
02:17:56,110 --> 02:17:59,000
but it doesn't look like
her at all. Does it? Yeah,

2372
02:17:59,001 --> 02:18:03,570
but it doesn't look like the lady at
all. A wall. You didn't even get fat. No,

2373
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:08,480
you didn't even get fat. Come on man.
That's the difference between her and uh,

2374
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:13,100
the uh, what's her face from,
um, who was in monster? Oh,

2375
02:18:13,101 --> 02:18:17,840
I'm honest. My Curl. Charlies.
Charlies. They're on. Yeah, she got fat.

2376
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:21,620
She did it the right way. She played
that lady the right way. Rector,

2377
02:18:21,621 --> 02:18:25,250
body code called cocaine godmother.

2378
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:29,680
Eh, that was a lifetime movie.
She needed to give it a day.

2379
02:18:29,681 --> 02:18:33,120
How'd you not give it an f?
Anything you want to lifetime.

2380
02:18:33,440 --> 02:18:37,850
Is it a d or f at least, but I think
Catherine Zeta Jones is Latina,

2381
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:41,920
so that's kind of fucked up that they
said they whitewashed or cause isn't that

2382
02:18:41,921 --> 02:18:45,770
Shane is in Catherine Zeta Jones
from Columbia. I said that.

2383
02:18:47,480 --> 02:18:51,950
I don't know. She's also apparently
losing her marbles. Really? Yeah.

2384
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:55,760
I read that. So you asked the, I don't
know about this Hollywood shit, man.

2385
02:18:55,761 --> 02:19:00,490
It just scares me to get out of
here outside. I noticed that.

2386
02:19:00,491 --> 02:19:04,630
I'm like, man, you, this is often the cut
a little bit. So she's Welsh, Welsh. Oh,

2387
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:08,200
sorry. Oh, sorry. Sorry. From the
United Kingdom. My, my apologies. Yeah,

2388
02:19:08,201 --> 02:19:12,910
they whitewash the shit
out of it. Yeah. Yeah.

2389
02:19:12,970 --> 02:19:15,760
How could you not give that
role to a fat Mexican lady?

2390
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:22,000
How could you not Colombian
lady can find a fat lady. Yeah.

2391
02:19:22,001 --> 02:19:26,020
Why not? I'm working anyway. He, here's
what you do. You have some stars.

2392
02:19:26,110 --> 02:19:29,610
You put them in supporting positions.
Yeah. And have her played a role. Yeah.

2393
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:34,100
I mean, go to Telemundo at channel.
They got many of them on there.

2394
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:37,880
Kevin's into John's was Welsh.
That don't even make no sense.

2395
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:41,990
I thought she was like Latino Columbia.
She was so hot when she was young.

2396
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:48,560
She's still married to old boy. What's
his name? Mike Douglas. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2397
02:19:48,561 --> 02:19:49,940
Look at that out.

2398
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:53,960
She come on and tell me she doesn't look
like Colombian or something. Which does,

2399
02:19:53,961 --> 02:19:57,940
right? Yeah. Well what
are you gonna do? Yeah.

2400
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:02,780
Whitewash. Yeah. That's Kinda
crazy. You can't do that anymore.

2401
02:20:02,781 --> 02:20:06,660
That's cultural appropriation, son.
What's wrong with that kid? Do it. Yeah.

2402
02:20:06,760 --> 02:20:11,330
You can't do it right now. Well, listen,

2403
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:14,720
anything that offends people may need
stay away from it just because it's too

2404
02:20:14,721 --> 02:20:17,820
much work. Yeah, that's the, yeah.
It's just too much work. It is.

2405
02:20:17,840 --> 02:20:21,290
It's just too much work. I sl, I
feel about the talent. You can say

2406
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:27,380
it's like talking to people about
politics. Like, yeah, I'm done.

2407
02:20:27,381 --> 02:20:29,340
I'm not talking about this
interested and I don't,

2408
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:33,500
and I'm not in a position to tell
anybody. We can offend them in, you know,

2409
02:20:33,530 --> 02:20:36,410
Snow Flake. I'm not in, I'm not going
to do it. I ain't call nobody snowflake.

2410
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:38,420
Listen,
something's going to offend somebody,

2411
02:20:38,421 --> 02:20:41,540
but it's just too much work and
it's too much work. This too.

2412
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:44,420
Especially for someone like
you. You're busy. Yeah.

2413
02:20:44,421 --> 02:20:46,100
I ain't got time for this shit shit to do.

2414
02:20:46,101 --> 02:20:48,860
You don't want to be arguing with
people all day on Twitter. Oh,

2415
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:53,360
about foreign policy.
Oh Man.

2416
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:57,290
I try. I try to stay off of Twitter banner
and sometimes I'll be in the middle of

2417
02:20:57,291 --> 02:21:00,620
writing a tweet and I go, I ain't, you
know, sending this shit good for you man.

2418
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:04,160
Good for you. I'm more friends. And that
Bert Kreischer just deleted his shit.

2419
02:21:04,520 --> 02:21:08,560
He deleted his shit off his phone. He
go, he, yeah, he deleted the APP. Yeah.

2420
02:21:09,430 --> 02:21:11,630
Twitter, Twitter at. Yeah. I don't
know why people are doing that now.

2421
02:21:11,631 --> 02:21:14,180
I know a lot of people are deleting
Twitter and they just don't,

2422
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:16,580
they don't read it anymore.
Don't pay attention to it anymore.

2423
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:19,230
I go in every now and then,
but I, the way I describe it,

2424
02:21:19,231 --> 02:21:22,040
it's always like peering into a
haunted house. Like, Whoa, yeah.

2425
02:21:22,290 --> 02:21:23,560
Fuck's going on in there.
Well,

2426
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:26,120
the problem is that it puts
everybody on the same level.

2427
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:29,420
So like you'd have shit,
you know what I'm saying?

2428
02:21:29,570 --> 02:21:34,250
You work your hardest to get something
and then you let these fucking guys just

2429
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:39,140
sign in and talk shit to you, you
know? Right. They don't do nothing.

2430
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:42,980
They'll do nothing in life but get on,
sign their name in and just talk shit.

2431
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,140
There's a lot of that.
There's a lot of that.

2432
02:21:45,141 --> 02:21:47,870
And sometimes someone would talk shit
to me and I'm like, who's this guy?

2433
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:51,110
I'm like, what is going on with this
guy's life? And then I'll, I don't,

2434
02:21:51,470 --> 02:21:54,740
I don't get upset, but I will click
their profile and then I look, oh,

2435
02:21:54,741 --> 02:21:57,040
they just talk shit to celebrities.
Yeah, that's what they do.

2436
02:21:57,070 --> 02:22:01,670
They talk shit to Nas and Jay and fucking,
you know,

2437
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:05,900
but it's hard sometimes
you just like, I see a,

2438
02:22:05,901 --> 02:22:09,650
what's the name and your boy Chris
Delea, right? Yeah. Crystal Lee.

2439
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:11,990
And like he'd be on that. Most of
people. Shit. Yeah, he loves it.

2440
02:22:13,390 --> 02:22:18,050
But his board is that what it is? Doesn't
do anything. This is what Chris does.

2441
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:22,730
Writes Jokes, goes to gym,
Talk Shit Online all day.

2442
02:22:22,731 --> 02:22:25,100
He's like making little funny videos.

2443
02:22:25,110 --> 02:22:28,080
And like he just can't wait
to do stand up his wishes.

2444
02:22:28,081 --> 02:22:32,310
Comedy clubs were operating
at noon. Really? Yeah. To
Leah loves doing stand up.

2445
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:33,810
If comedy clubs were open at noon,

2446
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:36,390
he had the store like almost
every night of the week.

2447
02:22:36,690 --> 02:22:38,220
He just can't wait to stand up again.

2448
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:41,910
Can't wait to go up there and kill
just the most fun. Really? Yeah.

2449
02:22:41,911 --> 02:22:43,470
So when he's not doing that,
he's talking shit.

2450
02:22:43,471 --> 02:22:47,850
The Logan Paul and fucking this guy
and that guy anyway. And He's good too.

2451
02:22:47,851 --> 02:22:51,430
So anyway, he says he'll crush
you. Crush it. I watched him,

2452
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:56,100
I watched him embarrassed Logan. Paul
felt so. I feel bad for Logan Paul,

2453
02:22:56,101 --> 02:22:59,940
but I would just like, you'll hurt
your feelings. Yeah, it will hurt.

2454
02:22:59,941 --> 02:23:02,790
You feel so good at that.
But I'm thinking like, man,

2455
02:23:02,791 --> 02:23:06,180
don't you got anything else to do? He
doesn't do off the day. He doesn't,

2456
02:23:06,181 --> 02:23:08,220
he doesn't read.
He's not doing anything.

2457
02:23:08,250 --> 02:23:13,210
He's not interested in like bettering
himself at all. It's doesn't care of me.

2458
02:23:13,211 --> 02:23:17,820
That's just who he is. He just likes being
funny and he likes talking Shit. Like,

2459
02:23:17,821 --> 02:23:20,820
if you look at his videos,
like he puts videos up on Instagram.

2460
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:25,990
They're just funny. This is
him, Dan. Fucking ridiculous
and being silly. I mean,

2461
02:23:25,991 --> 02:23:27,600
it's, you got going on
here. What's he doing here?

2462
02:23:27,690 --> 02:23:31,630
Talking Shit about the Coachella. That's
very short. Okay, we hear this again.

2463
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:40,970
The people and the bands played
Coachella this year are fuck.

2464
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:49,470
So sorry.

2465
02:23:49,820 --> 02:23:52,670
Three to the lobby were just like,
this is the perfect way to it is,

2466
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:57,350
is it that bad? What is going
on with Coachella? Was it bad?

2467
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:01,040
Sure. I don't know. Sure. What are
the names? I mean it's just hold,

2468
02:24:01,130 --> 02:24:04,850
I got the arguments people were making.
It's just that I can Instagram concert.

2469
02:24:04,851 --> 02:24:08,300
People are just going to have pictures
up. There's always a lot of that, right?

2470
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:10,463
Oh,

2471
02:24:11,510 --> 02:24:14,740
also someone that Coachella lineup?

2472
02:24:15,710 --> 02:24:16,850
No,
not that one.

2473
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:20,370
What do we got here? Hmm? Who Do we got?

2474
02:24:21,060 --> 02:24:25,260
Childish Gambino can't go wrong
there. Um, who are these other people?

2475
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:30,200
I don't know who these people are.
Kid Cuddy.

2476
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:33,500
Weezer I'm trying to see
people that I recognize.

2477
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:37,350
Uh, Ariana Grande Day. What?

2478
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:42,120
I'd be really mad if I was a DJ Khalid
and I saw Ariana Grande's names so much

2479
02:24:42,121 --> 02:24:45,510
bigger than mine. Oh, that's color. That's
a different, that's a different one.

2480
02:24:46,170 --> 02:24:48,080
He's a singer. How are you,
how do you have the same names?

2481
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:52,490
The other guy because the other
one was a DJ Cuban Dj. Ah,

2482
02:24:52,590 --> 02:24:57,510
get on what yourself. Who
is Boy Paulo? Pablo boy,

2483
02:24:57,511 --> 02:24:58,490
Pablo,
way down there.

2484
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:02,550
Tiny little name and then this dude
smaller name than him whose razor bumps.

2485
02:25:03,510 --> 02:25:06,420
I think that's part of what he is.
Maybe laughing at razor bumps is a,

2486
02:25:06,421 --> 02:25:09,300
that's what you get when you shave your
pussy. Nope. Don't make that as a name.

2487
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:10,883
That's ridiculous.

2488
02:25:13,550 --> 02:25:17,820
There's US girls and then I trust are
both also there. Um, social house. Okay.

2489
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:22,020
No disrespect to any of these bands.
I'm sure they're really good. But yeah,

2490
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,340
Chris is right along super organism.

2491
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:29,380
Oh super. Organisms are that. They're
working again. What serpent with feet.

2492
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:31,890
Okay. Shut this up. Before
I become crystal Leah

2493
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:37,330
music today, man, everybody had
to come out with music these days.

2494
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:40,360
A lot of musicians. I'm not in that
business. I don't understand it.

2495
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:42,310
I have them on here. I don't
know how they do it. I'm like,

2496
02:25:42,311 --> 02:25:44,620
I don't know what you're doing,
but you have him on here all the time.

2497
02:25:44,621 --> 02:25:46,570
Musician musicians all the
time. But I'm like, I just,

2498
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:49,630
that world is just such a difficult,

2499
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:51,880
it's so difficult to break through.

2500
02:25:52,030 --> 02:25:55,510
Like it seems like the most difficult
world to break through because of the

2501
02:25:55,511 --> 02:25:59,680
competition. Does everybody thinks they
can do it. There's a lot of competition,

2502
02:25:59,830 --> 02:26:01,900
especially rappers.
You don't have to hold a note.

2503
02:26:02,140 --> 02:26:03,840
All you have to do is just make Shit Ryan.
Yeah.

2504
02:26:03,910 --> 02:26:07,240
And you don't even really have to do that.
Not Anymore. Now I can mumble your way.

2505
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,250
Things. Yeah, you're right.

2506
02:26:09,251 --> 02:26:13,570
Like the rap industry got like,
at least in fighting,

2507
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:18,940
you can win. You keep going.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And fighting.
You just fuck people up.

2508
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:22,840
Yeah. And if you fuck everybody up, you
win. Yeah. You win and you're going to be,

2509
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:23,950
you're going to be the greatest ever.

2510
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:27,420
Nobody has to like you once
they lock that cage door show,

2511
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:29,320
you just fucked that person up.
I'm sorry I didn't like it,

2512
02:26:29,321 --> 02:26:32,380
but I fucked your boy up. Cut
and dry. That's what it is.

2513
02:26:32,381 --> 02:26:36,210
And rap or music
industry. It's like, yeah,

2514
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:41,530
I'm the best I can. There's a lot of
biting, a lot of stealing, stealing wraps,

2515
02:26:41,531 --> 02:26:44,260
and stealing rhymes and does a
lot of that in that world too.

2516
02:26:46,350 --> 02:26:47,770
It's rough and comedy.

2517
02:26:48,760 --> 02:26:53,260
If people are laughing and then
you keep going in that, I suppose.

2518
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:57,910
Yeah, but also in comedy,
there's so many places to work.

2519
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:03,010
Like the, so many comedy clubs. There's
so many comedy clubs. Oh really?

2520
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:07,150
So you can work a lot. As a
comedian, you can work every night.

2521
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:12,760
You might not get booked as a beginner,
but once you get going at once,

2522
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:17,530
like you name a guy who's, who's a good
colleague, Adam Hunter. Perfect example.

2523
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:20,800
Good comments. Like how it works
everywhere. He's always working.

2524
02:27:21,850 --> 02:27:25,600
He's always got something going on
and you could, if he was a rapper,

2525
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:30,100
he would be fucked. You know what I mean?
It's like if you're that level wrapper,

2526
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:33,730
like there's not a lot of options for you.
Where are you going to work?

2527
02:27:33,731 --> 02:27:36,670
There's no rap club. I'm going to go
to the rap club. Do a five minute set.

2528
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:40,350
That's shit's not real.
I you're right.

2529
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:43,900
But comedy. Yeah. I, but I didn't know,

2530
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:47,770
but I thought it was kind of hard to get
put on though. Like as a, it's not, well,

2531
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:50,020
not for Adam obviously because
he's pretty successful,

2532
02:27:50,021 --> 02:27:54,490
but in the beginning there's plenty of
little tiny places and bring her shows

2533
02:27:54,491 --> 02:27:59,350
where you do like, you know, a couple
minutes and then once you're good comedy,

2534
02:27:59,380 --> 02:28:03,870
uh, one thing about comedians, they
help each other. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

2535
02:28:03,880 --> 02:28:07,600
I heard it was like the
opposite. What'd you hear that?
Well, Norton, no, no, no, no,

2536
02:28:07,601 --> 02:28:10,530
no. Wasn't Tim didn't today said,
um, it's different in New York. Yeah.

2537
02:28:10,570 --> 02:28:13,810
There's some comedians they
get jealous of other ones.

2538
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:18,230
Did have a hat that are successful. Yeah.
Those are the ones that suck. Yeah. Okay.

2539
02:28:18,280 --> 02:28:21,980
That makes sense. The good ones support
other ones that are good because

2540
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:25,940
you realize you need them. It's almost
like you need a, if you're in a gym,

2541
02:28:25,941 --> 02:28:28,480
you need guys that are really good
around here. Pushing a chain of potters.

2542
02:28:28,490 --> 02:28:31,970
You need that with comedy too. Yeah. You
need other comedians who are really good,

2543
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:37,210
elevates your, your idea of what's
good. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

2544
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:40,970
I think in general comedians are probably
one of the more supportive of all art

2545
02:28:40,971 --> 02:28:44,480
forms, one of the more supportive
of other people that are doing it.

2546
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:47,760
I would hope so because it's such a,

2547
02:28:47,870 --> 02:28:52,520
a world where if as I should be comedian
against the audience it seems like,

2548
02:28:52,521 --> 02:28:53,960
so like you kind of need people to,

2549
02:28:54,090 --> 02:28:56,840
to support you and have your back
and go and I'll worry about that one.

2550
02:28:57,790 --> 02:29:02,240
As long as Nolan stealing from you
when they're on stage, you're not.

2551
02:29:02,390 --> 02:29:04,250
So it shouldn't affect you at all.

2552
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:08,120
And in fact you probably got into
comedy because you're a fan of comedy.

2553
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:11,270
That's how I got into it.
So if I was,

2554
02:29:11,450 --> 02:29:13,640
if I didn't enjoy other people
that were really good at it,

2555
02:29:13,641 --> 02:29:14,600
like what I took away,

2556
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:17,810
the one thing that I really love to
watch and then I started doing it for a

2557
02:29:17,811 --> 02:29:21,710
living, now I can enjoy it anymore. That's
crazy. Knowing what you enjoy it is.

2558
02:29:21,711 --> 02:29:23,960
You got to appreciate
something that's really good.

2559
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:26,870
You can't be seeing someone
go on that good. Yeah.

2560
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:29,480
It could be better shows
up to fuck that crowd.

2561
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:33,450
So do you still go watch sometimes,
like you watch your homeboys? Yes. Yes.

2562
02:29:33,470 --> 02:29:35,450
To Watch my friends.
Yeah, all the time. Yeah.

2563
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:38,060
That's one of the reasons
why if I go on the road,

2564
02:29:38,061 --> 02:29:40,370
I always bring really funny
people with me. I'm on a laugh.

2565
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:43,280
I want to laugh before I go up.
Some comedians don't want that though.

2566
02:29:43,281 --> 02:29:47,720
They want the audience to be suffering
until they get up the terrible opening

2567
02:29:47,721 --> 02:29:51,740
acts. What? Yeah, like a
terrible idea. I agree.

2568
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:55,580
But see you're coming at it
from a martial arts perspective,

2569
02:29:56,030 --> 02:30:00,350
like martial artists, like
look, you martial artists,

2570
02:30:00,351 --> 02:30:03,770
first of all, everybody supports
everybody. Everybody helps everybody.

2571
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:07,820
You have to training together. You're
working with, there's coaching,

2572
02:30:08,060 --> 02:30:11,300
there's like you're, you're,
you're advancing each other
that you appreciate it.

2573
02:30:11,301 --> 02:30:14,690
When someone fuck somebody up. Like you
realize like damn the guy is good. That's,

2574
02:30:14,700 --> 02:30:19,040
this is good. This is like a lot of props.
Like, if you see like a comedy special,

2575
02:30:19,730 --> 02:30:23,450
you'll see a bunch of comedians tweeting
about how good a comedy special is.

2576
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:24,230
You don't,

2577
02:30:24,230 --> 02:30:27,780
I don't think you see that much in the
rap world or someone is really good.

2578
02:30:27,781 --> 02:30:28,910
And then a bunch of other people,

2579
02:30:28,911 --> 02:30:32,120
other rappers or chime in about how great
that thing was. You won't see. Yeah,

2580
02:30:32,121 --> 02:30:34,250
you're right. That's, you're right
about that. But with the finders,

2581
02:30:34,251 --> 02:30:38,150
you do have some money. Fuck somebody
up and like some, some big like, damn.

2582
02:30:38,151 --> 02:30:41,240
He looked good tonight. They look
good and you'll see all this chatter.

2583
02:30:41,241 --> 02:30:45,460
All the people supporting it. Yeah. Rap
is the opposite. The opposite. Yeah.

2584
02:30:45,620 --> 02:30:48,740
Fuck everybody. Fuck, fuck, fuck the

2585
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:54,710
tro games. That's the weird
one, right? That drug game.

2586
02:30:56,200 --> 02:31:00,290
Oh Man. Do you, uh, do you
anticipate staying in south Florida?

2587
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:03,920
I don't know. I mean, so I
don't know if they have it on.

2588
02:31:03,921 --> 02:31:08,330
Where are you from originally
from Delaware? Yeah. So I
got buddies from Delaware.

2589
02:31:08,360 --> 02:31:12,050
I know. I'm the only one. I made it
to the only person ever escape it.

2590
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:17,000
Actually me and I'm, remember
it was a state, you know,
here's an interesting fact.

2591
02:31:17,001 --> 02:31:20,160
Me and Roxanne and modifier
was born in the same. Really?

2592
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:24,750
Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah.
What are the odds? I don't
know. I know, but I'm not,

2593
02:31:24,751 --> 02:31:28,770
I'm originally from Delaware,
so eventually I feel like
I want to be a snowbird.

2594
02:31:29,130 --> 02:31:33,840
Yeah. Meaning, you know, yeah. So coat
hang out in Florida during the, um,

2595
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:36,450
during the winter months. Yeah. And
where were you live? And the other time,

2596
02:31:36,480 --> 02:31:39,210
I don't know. I might go
Pennsylvania, Jersey or some shit.

2597
02:31:39,211 --> 02:31:42,810
That's a vein like Philly. Yeah. That's
a math. My focus is wrong. Really.

2598
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:47,530
Phil is nice. Yeah. I love
Philly. Philly's real, you
know what it was like? Yeah.

2599
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:51,120
I said they're really intelligent people
that will punch you in the face. Yeah.

2600
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:56,270
That's Philly. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
They're wow. Wow. Yeah. They,

2601
02:31:56,300 --> 02:31:59,100
they're real and they're
passionate and they're, wow. Yeah.

2602
02:31:59,130 --> 02:32:03,180
So you kinda have to like
that. Uh, yeah. It's, uh, in,

2603
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:05,730
they're better looking than
Boston. Sorry, Boston really?

2604
02:32:05,760 --> 02:32:09,960
Girls are better looking at Philly. Why
is that? I don't know. It's too smart.

2605
02:32:09,961 --> 02:32:14,700
And if I grew up in Boston. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't know about that. I think,

2606
02:32:14,710 --> 02:32:15,360
um,

2607
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:20,040
Boston is dealing with a lot of the
original genes of the original travelers

2608
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:21,540
didn't made it across that boat.

2609
02:32:22,130 --> 02:32:25,500
Just savage folk that didn't want
to live in Europe anymore. Yeah.

2610
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:28,440
Those genes are not the best jeans.
Bunch of animals.

2611
02:32:28,840 --> 02:32:29,790
They're still dealing with them.

2612
02:32:29,791 --> 02:32:33,580
Fucking jeans still punching each other
and a lot of fist fights in Boston. Yeah.

2613
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:36,380
You go out on a Friday,
Saturday night and go around the bars.

2614
02:32:36,381 --> 02:32:38,580
You'll see plenty of
fist fights in Boston.

2615
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:42,210
That's one of the few places in the
world where people still are going to

2616
02:32:42,211 --> 02:32:44,970
regular basis. Beat the shit out
of each other on the streets.

2617
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:49,690
That's good then you know, at least
ain't shooting drunk and savages. Well,

2618
02:32:49,691 --> 02:32:53,340
there's some shootings too for sure. But
there's a lot of law of knuckling down.

2619
02:32:53,341 --> 02:32:54,660
Yeah.
It's kind of good.

2620
02:32:54,770 --> 02:32:57,180
But I think there's something
to that gene whole gene thing.

2621
02:32:57,181 --> 02:33:00,870
When I was in Milwaukee and I was like,
damn, why these fucking people so ugly.

2622
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:02,233
Yeah,

2623
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,173
it's true.

2624
02:33:06,940 --> 02:33:11,620
Got Those old g like I need to
get some mixing going on. Yeah.

2625
02:33:12,020 --> 02:33:15,470
Well I think that's the
reason why California has
some of the best look in jeans

2626
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:18,380
because the people that
lived on the east coast,

2627
02:33:18,381 --> 02:33:20,090
like I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

2628
02:33:20,150 --> 02:33:23,120
They kept going until they got to
California and they hit that water might,

2629
02:33:24,310 --> 02:33:27,170
I don't want to live in Hawaii.
Fuck yeah. Stay right here.

2630
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:29,220
And then just the breeding.
Yeah,

2631
02:33:29,420 --> 02:33:31,460
and then there's also the
entertainment business.

2632
02:33:31,461 --> 02:33:33,290
All the pretty people from Cincinnati,

2633
02:33:33,710 --> 02:33:35,990
they got on a bus and
they came out here yet.

2634
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:40,130
I'm going to make it look at these
cheeks. Yeah, I'm going to make it.

2635
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:41,120
How many of them make it

2636
02:33:41,650 --> 02:33:45,490
very, very, very, very, very few.

2637
02:33:47,140 --> 02:33:50,100
It's almost not even worth it. Almost
not even worth it. Unless you make it.

2638
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:53,950
Then you're like, oh,
I love Jamie Bitch Dat,

2639
02:33:54,010 --> 02:33:57,460
Dat da who won. Yeah, that's right.

2640
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:01,090
Fist full of cash and throwing them
up in the air. Make an Instagram.

2641
02:34:01,091 --> 02:34:04,600
Video's rolling around in your silk
sheets filled with hundred dollar bills.

2642
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:08,770
I almost feel like it's best seen,
like in the age we live in now,

2643
02:34:08,771 --> 02:34:12,640
it's better to just stay where you're at
and put shit out online. Oh, online. Yeah,

2644
02:34:12,641 --> 02:34:14,020
for sure.
Yeah.

2645
02:34:14,021 --> 02:34:18,010
But I think people are still caught
up in the mystique of like coming to

2646
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:22,990
Hollywood, making it in Hollywood. The
even people that do big things online,

2647
02:34:22,991 --> 02:34:25,900
they still want to do like legitimate
things. Like I'd love to do movies.

2648
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:27,730
You know who love to do TV.

2649
02:34:28,250 --> 02:34:31,810
They want to do things that pay them less
money than they do piano. Youtube Star.

2650
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:35,950
Yeah. Really? Huh? Youtube
pays a lot of money now.

2651
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:38,830
Like if you're a big like Logan
Paul type dude. Yeah. They make,

2652
02:34:38,831 --> 02:34:43,260
he makes a shit load of money on youtube.
Like who fucking pays in my who?

2653
02:34:43,360 --> 02:34:46,980
Who signs his check advertisements.
So selling advocates,

2654
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:50,020
these videos on the videos get millions
and millions of hits and he gets

2655
02:34:50,021 --> 02:34:51,970
millions of dollars from
advertisement revenue.

2656
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:56,500
Probably more money than most
successful Sitcom people. Yeah.

2657
02:34:56,501 --> 02:34:59,650
If you think of like someone who's on a
successful television show, you think,

2658
02:34:59,651 --> 02:35:00,880
well that guy has gotta be palling.

2659
02:35:01,090 --> 02:35:06,010
I Bet Logan Paul makes twice as much
money as those people. Fuck, I know.

2660
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:10,150
Crazy. And in this people like Pooty
pie. How much does that guy make?

2661
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:14,050
He's got like 77 million subscribers.
So the,

2662
02:35:14,110 --> 02:35:17,740
but the only thing about that guy is he
likes to say controversial shit and he

2663
02:35:17,741 --> 02:35:21,670
gets in trouble and then sometimes they
pull ads off of him and stuff like that.

2664
02:35:21,671 --> 02:35:25,270
But I think if you're one of
those like Ninjas, he another one,

2665
02:35:25,271 --> 02:35:28,990
that video game guy, those people
make outrageous sums of money.

2666
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:32,930
Outrageous sums of money. Like playing
video games and talking shit. Yeah,

2667
02:35:32,931 --> 02:35:34,450
I sought,
it was like this little kid.

2668
02:35:34,451 --> 02:35:38,830
It was like a seven year old may
like $20 million doing toys. Yeah.

2669
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:41,710
Ryan. Oh, Ryan's toy review.
That's the kid at him.

2670
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:46,860
He made 22 million in
2018 by reviewing toys.

2671
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:49,480
This little Asian kid ran
a little kid right there.

2672
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:51,700
How much do you think the
parents let them keep?

2673
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:56,650
I'd tell my parents or suck my dick
fuck out of my room. You clean my room,

2674
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:00,520
set up that fucking video
and you cleaned my room.

2675
02:36:02,410 --> 02:36:06,840
This muffling just wiffle ball Paul.
21 million.

2676
02:36:06,841 --> 02:36:10,570
So he looked at that 21
million just by talking to,

2677
02:36:10,720 --> 02:36:12,430
he had a Disney show for awhile.

2678
02:36:12,760 --> 02:36:17,260
He was on a Disney show that my kids
watch and then he decided, fuck that.

2679
02:36:18,130 --> 02:36:20,050
I'd rather just be in my house.

2680
02:36:20,380 --> 02:36:25,270
What does it say on his wall team
team Paul 10 that's the team 10 squad.

2681
02:36:25,480 --> 02:36:27,900
He'd be like painted down on his wall.
He's got a mansion.

2682
02:36:27,940 --> 02:36:29,320
It's to all fucked up inside.

2683
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:33,270
They've got one of those
Lego installations too that
some guy came in and put it

2684
02:36:33,271 --> 02:36:38,200
like it was all and as wall.
Oh, interesting. So who's
number three? Let's see. Ah,

2685
02:36:38,201 --> 02:36:40,600
this is a group of guys,
dude, dude, perfect.

2686
02:36:40,660 --> 02:36:45,280
They make a like five man sports
crew. Oh, I've seen those guys.

2687
02:36:45,281 --> 02:36:48,010
They do stuff with bows and Arrow,
all kinds of things.

2688
02:36:48,011 --> 02:36:49,580
They've been doing it for a few years.
They kind of like,

2689
02:36:49,780 --> 02:36:52,930
they've been burning down like any
kind of chip shot you can think of.

2690
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:57,700
So they made $20 million or five of them,
so 5 million bucks each.

2691
02:36:57,701 --> 02:37:01,270
It's not nothing to sneeze at.
And then what else guys?

2692
02:37:01,271 --> 02:37:06,271
This solo like Dan TDM and he made 18
million Holla slash ball and I can go

2693
02:37:08,021 --> 02:37:11,110

Jeff makeup star makeup artists.

2695
02:37:14,441 --> 02:37:19,130
Since the era has reinvented himself
as a beauty mogul, wait a minute.

2696
02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:23,590
You say himself a you mis-gendering him.
I didn't say that article.

2697
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:26,960
Mis-Gendered I think
that's a whatever that is.

2698
02:37:27,330 --> 02:37:32,330
What is this one mark up video plier
17 nobody ever see that guy before.

2699
02:37:33,860 --> 02:37:36,650

Meanwhile, I made $17 million.

2700
02:37:38,120 --> 02:37:41,150
Vanos gaming,

I never heard another guy that just,

2705
02:37:58,041 --> 02:38:00,420
he's a famous guy. I don't
know too much about it. Dumb.

2706
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:04,610
I never watched him the most.
Followed 72.5 million followers.

2707
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:07,820
I think the reason why he makes less
money is because of the advertisers have

2708
02:38:07,821 --> 02:38:10,910
abandoned him cause he dropped
some bombs. Oh, he did? Yeah.

2709
02:38:10,911 --> 02:38:14,960
What does it say up there? What does it
say about his, uh, no below him. Below.

2710
02:38:15,020 --> 02:38:18,740
They're Swedish gamer. The most
followed. Yeah, a backlash last year.

2711
02:38:18,741 --> 02:38:23,280
Rat ranch of antisemetic videos.
That's right. Antisemetic he said he,

2712
02:38:23,530 --> 02:38:23,930
he,

2713
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:28,930
but it was like he was joking around and
he like was making fun of antisemetic

2714
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:33,350
people. But while I was wearing a Hitler
outfit, right? Something like that.

2715
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:36,980
And they were like, yeah, it's kind
of tastes, but again, too much work.

2716
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:39,980
Like you paid some people like
Mitt to makeup, Fiverr video,

2717
02:38:40,100 --> 02:38:44,510
putting up signs that they
didn't know what they just
did. It does that too. Yeah.

2718
02:38:44,511 --> 02:38:46,640
Well Anyway, point being, you're right,

2719
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:51,760
they can make a shit load of money
just being on youtube and on twitch,

2720
02:38:52,670 --> 02:38:57,050
playing video games.
I know that's real.

2721
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:01,010
That's like if you're a CEO of
a gigantic fucking corporation,

2722
02:39:01,011 --> 02:39:05,450
you work 15 hours a day, you be super
happy to make with these assholes

2723
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:11,450
with the exception that a little kid,
I'm going to give a pass.

2724
02:39:11,451 --> 02:39:15,680
But the rest of them do. They're just
assholes on youtube making money.

2725
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:19,220
I think you have to be an
asshole to get attention to.

2726
02:39:19,250 --> 02:39:23,060
I mean that's like part of the thing
you got to be. What does Miranda sings?

2727
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:26,000
Is She in that list?
Just the top 10?

2728
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:30,470
She's not in the top 10 but I mean there's
probably like a hundred people that

2729
02:39:30,471 --> 02:39:35,080
make 7 million. Oh I
know Mami. Just get me.

2730
02:39:35,190 --> 02:39:39,440
So I got my online project coming out.
Train Bjj,

2731
02:39:39,441 --> 02:39:43,480
online.com. Yeah. Nice. Um, shit to shit.

2732
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:46,130
And you're training Bjj online.com.

2733
02:39:46,131 --> 02:39:50,180
Is that just like from
white belt to black belt?

2734
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:52,880
Like you learn no curriculum?
No,

2735
02:39:52,881 --> 02:39:57,140
not even like that cause I'm really care
about belts. Okay. To be honest with you,

2736
02:39:57,530 --> 02:40:00,890
I care about being effective and you know,

2737
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:05,891
as much as I do like Jujitsu for MMA
is different for like competition.

2738
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:10,180
Sure. Very different. Yeah. So like
that's what I'm focusing on. You know,

2739
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:14,010
the differences and to make this shit
work again because I think a lot of

2740
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:17,920
people are doing Jujitsu
wrong for MMA you to use it.

2741
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:22,140
I thinking they're using it
wrong. How so? Um, you know like,

2742
02:40:22,141 --> 02:40:24,960
cause when you talk about like Jujitsu
the way it's been played recently,

2743
02:40:24,961 --> 02:40:28,410
it's like well [inaudible] just to
plate and competition all about getting

2744
02:40:28,411 --> 02:40:33,270
points, passing card, getting a back, put
the hooks in, that shit don't work in him.

2745
02:40:33,271 --> 02:40:37,800
May Hey their planet
for points. Right. So,

2746
02:40:37,830 --> 02:40:39,450
um,
I do it.

2747
02:40:39,540 --> 02:40:43,830
I've just created and developed a bunch
of positions to we fuck people up,

2748
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:48,420
we hurt people and then submit them.
That's the key.

2749
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:52,080
You should Jujitsu to hurt
people then submit them.

2750
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:53,940
When you say you use it to hurt people,

2751
02:40:53,941 --> 02:40:58,350
you mean use it to maintain a position
and land strikes, punching people,

2752
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:02,730
punching people and then submit them
and soften them up a little bit. Yeah.

2753
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:06,780
So like the mentality of it is
different. You know, I'm not, I'm not,

2754
02:41:06,810 --> 02:41:07,860
cause I think about it,
you're like,

2755
02:41:07,861 --> 02:41:09,630
if I were when you were
doing Jujitsu right now,

2756
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:13,350
like in order for me to pass your guard
it would take me fucking 10 minutes.

2757
02:41:13,370 --> 02:41:15,240
You know you have five
minutes to do this shit.

2758
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:18,570
I'm not trying to pass your guard.
I'm trying to punch you. Yeah.

2759
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:22,110
And also the other thing about it is
like there's certain positions where you

2760
02:41:22,111 --> 02:41:26,160
really just can't get away with if
someone's punching. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

2761
02:41:26,250 --> 02:41:31,250
Like especially the bottom bottom game
has suffered tremendously because it

2762
02:41:31,321 --> 02:41:32,160
hasn't evolved.

2763
02:41:32,161 --> 02:41:35,600
Like Jujitsu has an evolved from the
bottom and like that's something that,

2764
02:41:35,601 --> 02:41:39,510
like I said, when I stopped competing, I
studied, studied, studied, say what works,

2765
02:41:39,511 --> 02:41:43,140
what doesn't work and now I figured
out like all these different systems.

2766
02:41:43,170 --> 02:41:46,860
I think that Jujitsu has evolved
from the bottom in, in high level.

2767
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:51,230
Jujitsu competitions. We just haven't
seen as much of it in MMA. Oh.

2768
02:41:51,360 --> 02:41:54,330
For competition. Like Jujitsu
is as great as it's ever been.

2769
02:41:54,331 --> 02:41:57,180
It's beautiful to watch. Like the
way these guys move, you know,

2770
02:41:57,181 --> 02:42:00,450
watching Keena Cornelius like slither
on a floor. It's fucking beautiful,

2771
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:03,070
but I would do okay in a mean way,

2772
02:42:03,071 --> 02:42:06,360
but like most like just
theoretically most guys wouldn't.

2773
02:42:06,420 --> 02:42:10,140
I think Gary tone and it's going to do
very well. He's doing well already. Yeah,

2774
02:42:10,170 --> 02:42:11,670
I think so.
Tony in one FC.

2775
02:42:11,671 --> 02:42:15,090
But I think Gary Tonin has
such a high level ground game,

2776
02:42:15,350 --> 02:42:18,660
particularly with his leg locks. Yeah.
And you know, and he could do everything.

2777
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:22,500
Your back arm bar, you, whatever
you, whatever you need. And he's um,

2778
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:25,970
he's making his way through the ranks at
war. I'm very excited about one. Yeah,

2779
02:42:25,980 --> 02:42:30,300
me too. I like one FC, I'm a big fan,
Lido gay tone and like he, he came,

2780
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:32,130
I don't know if he wrestled before,
but he has like a,

2781
02:42:32,131 --> 02:42:34,440
a wrestler's mentality
when it comes to Jujitsu.

2782
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:38,790
Like he's very aggressive and he's
like, he's Fairless, you know,

2783
02:42:38,791 --> 02:42:42,520
he's fucking on the money. So I like
his chances against anybody. Yeah.

2784
02:42:42,720 --> 02:42:45,040
I liked his chances to be a
world champion. Yeah. Me Too.

2785
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:48,300
In MMA in any organization.
And, but I think on the ground,

2786
02:42:48,301 --> 02:42:52,950
like he's so far above almost everybody
else he's going to face. I know,

2787
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,960
you know, especially when it
comes to the leg lock came,

2788
02:42:54,961 --> 02:42:59,020
his leg locks are just that whole Donna,
her death squad, you know, there's,

2789
02:42:59,330 --> 02:43:04,050
they're raising some fucking killers over
and I'm studying as shit now because I

2790
02:43:04,051 --> 02:43:06,820
think there's a place for it. And
I think that in MMA people, aw,

2791
02:43:06,900 --> 02:43:08,880
that shit don't work. They just
don't get punched in the face. Yeah,

2792
02:43:08,900 --> 02:43:12,010
that's what I'm saying. I'm like,
cause MMA guys don't really know how to

2793
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:14,080
do it. Right. Right.
To not doing it right.

2794
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:16,390
They're just swinging her
leg around trying to squeeze,

2795
02:43:16,490 --> 02:43:20,490
they're not doing it right. Right.
Well, even Paul, Horace, you know, um,

2796
02:43:20,530 --> 02:43:24,190
when they were, um, when they were
talking about Gary Tonin was gonna face,

2797
02:43:24,191 --> 02:43:27,700
Paul Horace Porras is so much bigger
and so much stronger than Gary,

2798
02:43:27,701 --> 02:43:30,730
Tony and Gary Tona and still
threaten the fuck out of them.

2799
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:35,800
Hadn't been some real bad spots. And you
know, they went to a drop of the draw.

2800
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:39,000
Like if it were pointing to, I mean,
if you were to see who won wanes. Yeah.

2801
02:43:39,130 --> 02:43:41,200
First of all, they're not
the same side. Right. I mean,

2802
02:43:41,201 --> 02:43:45,940
what does Gary fighting in one fc one
50, 55 probably. Yeah. 200. 200 pounds.

2803
02:43:45,941 --> 02:43:50,230
He said go rilla. Yeah, he needs,
he's on every Mexican supplement.

2804
02:43:50,460 --> 02:43:53,470
Have an event like the
little pit bull on yeah,

2805
02:43:53,471 --> 02:43:54,850
no wicki would come to him with it,

2806
02:43:54,851 --> 02:43:58,570
but like a fucking paper towel and just
wipe his [inaudible] got everything on

2807
02:43:58,571 --> 02:44:02,920
this towel. Every fucking, every
metabolite that's every existed.

2808
02:44:03,370 --> 02:44:07,450
Yeah. He's a Jew. He's a
gigantic guy. And, but they
were saying that his leg game,

2809
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:11,230
even though it's effective in terms of
MMA, like his transitions in his entries,

2810
02:44:11,231 --> 02:44:14,050
they're very limited and they're obvious
and they were seeing them comment and

2811
02:44:14,060 --> 02:44:17,090
then he showed it and then they
competed against him. Yeah.

2812
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:20,980
But I like Gary Tone and I think he's
going to do wonderful over there. I mean,

2813
02:44:20,981 --> 02:44:23,590
it'll be interesting to see him fight.
Uh,

2814
02:44:24,190 --> 02:44:27,850
I mean obviously Eddie Alvarez, that'll
be there probably in the same division.

2815
02:44:27,851 --> 02:44:31,060
So like it would be interesting to
see that. Yes. Very, very interesting.

2816
02:44:31,090 --> 02:44:34,090
Very interesting. Yeah. Eddie
Alvarez going over there. It's huge.

2817
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:36,970
I'm mighty mouse going over there is huge.
You know,

2818
02:44:36,971 --> 02:44:38,590
Brandon verus the heavyweight champion.

2819
02:44:38,591 --> 02:44:42,850
Now you know Brenda Barrett's
fucking people up over this. Yes.

2820
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:44,410
Yes.
Under the radar.

2821
02:44:44,411 --> 02:44:46,900
Because then you don't really hear much
about him being over there fighting.

2822
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:49,420
And it seems like someone he knows
been south of the border as well,

2823
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:53,750
about 240 pounds. Oh my God. He's so
jacked. He never seen Brandon Vera.

2824
02:44:53,751 --> 02:44:55,360
Now I haven't seen him in years.
Dude.

2825
02:44:55,660 --> 02:44:59,730
I didn't even really was fighting
over this. Some mash and people. Yeah.

2826
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:03,910
Smashing people.
And he's like 240 plus pounds now.

2827
02:45:04,060 --> 02:45:07,870
No shit to giant neck fucking traps.
Jacked his fuck.

2828
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:11,410
Is he still training at alliance down?
I believe so. I believe so, yeah.

2829
02:45:12,260 --> 02:45:14,210
But I'll tell you what man, like
you were saying, that leg lock game,

2830
02:45:14,211 --> 02:45:18,230
like Ryan Hall has the ability to beat
anybody in the featherweight division.

2831
02:45:18,530 --> 02:45:22,490
Yeah. If he catches a whole of a limb.
Yeah. Yeah. I think he could beat,

2832
02:45:22,700 --> 02:45:25,790
I think he'd beat Holloway the
same as he'd beat anybody else.

2833
02:45:25,820 --> 02:45:27,080
And I'm not saying he can beat them,

2834
02:45:27,081 --> 02:45:31,440
but I'm just saying like if he gets
all done, he's, yeah, he's, yeah,

2835
02:45:32,030 --> 02:45:36,650
he could tap anybody that's, yeah. His
level of Jujitsu, his understanding,

2836
02:45:36,651 --> 02:45:40,310
his technique, his skill
levels. Very, very, very high.

2837
02:45:40,311 --> 02:45:42,890
Like World Championship
caliber, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

2838
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:47,270
But there's a bunch of garlic there.
That's Brandon vera now jacked.

2839
02:45:49,350 --> 02:45:52,680
He's jacked dude. Show me.
Show me. Yeah, look at that.

2840
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:57,100
Like when he was in the UFC,
he was skinny and slim. Well,

2841
02:45:57,110 --> 02:46:00,510
he's finding two oh five and heavyweight
in the UFC. Now he's just heavyweight.

2842
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:03,870
And so he just packed on some
meat, put up, put a video of like,

2843
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:06,840
there's a Brandon vera
highlight Kao video out there.

2844
02:46:08,390 --> 02:46:12,980
But uh, he's people up over
there, man. Let's see something.

2845
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:16,910
Just a, that one that's on
the other ago. The truth,

2846
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:21,210
Brandon Vera highlights. Don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't,

2847
02:46:21,211 --> 02:46:25,950
don't Mr Freak z's 75,
whatever the fuck that is.

2848
02:46:26,430 --> 02:46:30,210
Whoever the gentleman is to put together
this highlight reel. It says the truth.

2849
02:46:30,211 --> 02:46:33,990
Brandon Vera highlights February one
championships, highlight contest.

2850
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:39,320
Let me see some fighting parts.
Is it all now? Here we go.

2851
02:46:44,790 --> 02:46:45,623
Boom.

2852
02:46:47,260 --> 02:46:50,030
And Brandon Vera always had like
very high level striking. Yeah,

2853
02:46:50,031 --> 02:46:52,040
he was always Chris.
Yeah.

2854
02:46:52,430 --> 02:46:55,940
And they see the one fc you can head kick
and he kicked people apparently in the

2855
02:46:55,941 --> 02:47:00,650
back of the head, which is kind,
Kinda fucked up. Um, I don't know, uh,

2856
02:47:00,651 --> 02:47:04,160
what the competition is alike in
the heavyweight division at one FC,

2857
02:47:04,161 --> 02:47:05,690
like what level is,

2858
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:10,100
but I imagine with the size of the
organization about how big it is that the

2859
02:47:10,101 --> 02:47:13,820
competition is going to continue to
rise and all weight classes right now.

2860
02:47:13,821 --> 02:47:16,250
Like in terms of the number
of people that are watching,

2861
02:47:16,251 --> 02:47:20,540
it rivals the UFC does it really? It's
John and in Asia. Judge a judge, a judge,

2862
02:47:20,541 --> 02:47:23,810
a giant. But I think it's going to
continue. They're making a lot of money,

2863
02:47:24,260 --> 02:47:26,510
throwing a lot of money,
yet elite fighters.

2864
02:47:26,570 --> 02:47:29,540
I'm hoping they brings him more because
they don't really have a strong American

2865
02:47:29,541 --> 02:47:34,520
presence. Well, I think they're signaling
by having Eddie Alvarez come over there.

2866
02:47:34,550 --> 02:47:38,840
Misha Tate is running shit over there
now too, as well as a rich Franklin.

2867
02:47:38,870 --> 02:47:41,330
He's running things.
I think he's the vice president there now.

2868
02:47:41,930 --> 02:47:45,860
A lot of shit happening over there.
We need it. Then we had another pride.

2869
02:47:45,890 --> 02:47:49,340
We need something like that. Yeah,
we do. Yeah, we do. I listen.

2870
02:47:49,341 --> 02:47:51,620
I'm all for it because I hate,
you know,

2871
02:47:51,621 --> 02:47:54,560
I work with a lot of guys and I hate when
he fucking don't have nowhere to work.

2872
02:47:54,680 --> 02:47:56,570
Exactly. You know, and
like if they're just,

2873
02:47:56,571 --> 02:47:59,930
if we only rely on the UFC
and we all know how that is,

2874
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:04,880
the one bad performance means you're out.
So it's, or a bad judging, right? Yeah.

2875
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:09,320
Yeah. What did you think about the PFL?
I love the PFL. Yeah. Yeah. I love it.

2876
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:11,700
I love the structure.
What's his name?

2877
02:48:11,700 --> 02:48:15,560
Sean O'connell says something
very interesting just off the top,

2878
02:48:15,561 --> 02:48:20,561
but he said I just made $1 million and
all I had to do was win and he repeated

2879
02:48:20,751 --> 02:48:22,610
it. All I had to do was
win. So to me I was like,

2880
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:26,000
I guess he was just saying like he
didn't have to be a character and this is

2881
02:48:26,001 --> 02:48:30,200
coming from prior to the only character
in Pfl. And he said that because like,

2882
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:33,190
oh no, no, no, no, my mother guys can
fucking do that shit, you know. But, um,

2883
02:48:33,290 --> 02:48:36,530
but who's watching? I don't think
anybody was, that's the thing.

2884
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:37,460
That's the problem.
Yeah.

2885
02:48:37,660 --> 02:48:42,080
I'm surprised he'd be Vinny [inaudible]
when the whole time I thought so too.

2886
02:48:42,290 --> 02:48:44,660
But um, but then when I
thought about it, I said, damn,

2887
02:48:44,661 --> 02:48:46,190
he's been training with Jeremy Horn,

2888
02:48:46,610 --> 02:48:51,020
his probably his whole career and Jeremy
Horn is a wizard to yeah. So yeah.

2889
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:55,720
But um, but I trained a couple of
the Russians for four to Pfl um,

2890
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:59,840
bag of man. He won the welterweight
against Ray Cooper to third. Yeah.

2891
02:48:59,841 --> 02:49:04,520
Ray Cooper's they'll fucking beast.
I know. Five, seven. I know. 170 lbs.

2892
02:49:04,521 --> 02:49:08,100
Throwing bricks. I know the, when
he fought Jake and beat him twice,

2893
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:12,160
like that stopped him twice a week. Jesus
state championship wrestler. I know. Uh,

2894
02:49:12,290 --> 02:49:14,460
yeah, I was, you know, I
didn't think he was, um,

2895
02:49:14,700 --> 02:49:18,170
cause my guy took them down early and I
was kind of surprised he took them down

2896
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:21,280
as early as he did because he
has a state champ. But what? Um,

2897
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:24,720
he seems small for the division.
Yeah.

2898
02:49:24,721 --> 02:49:28,690
He could probably fight at one 55 just
going to have a little more success. Yeah.

2899
02:49:30,120 --> 02:49:32,490
But I like the fact that at
least these guys have an option.

2900
02:49:32,610 --> 02:49:36,960
It's a place they can win a million,
million dollars. Then the finals,

2901
02:49:36,990 --> 02:49:39,330
like leading up to it, they're
still making good money. Yeah.

2902
02:49:39,450 --> 02:49:44,280
Like the loser made 250 and then like
how did they get eyeballs though?

2903
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:48,000
I don't know. That's the problem.
That is the problem. Right?

2904
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:50,460
That's the problem with everything.
I mean even with Bella tour,

2905
02:49:50,520 --> 02:49:53,460
I mean the way they got eyeballs
was to have like boys crazy fight.

2906
02:49:53,520 --> 02:49:56,400
I mean that's the way they get eyeballs
to have. They have to have someone,

2907
02:49:56,910 --> 02:49:58,860
they have to have someone
who's got a name, you know?

2908
02:49:58,861 --> 02:50:02,370
I mean that's the reason why they
brought over Tito and jail and all these,

2909
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:06,830
you know, it's hard. And that's what
I was saying like Sean O'Connor,

2910
02:50:06,840 --> 02:50:10,770
like if you ever hear him talk like he's
very charismatic and charming and he's

2911
02:50:10,771 --> 02:50:14,520
the only person who probably can handle
himself on a mic. It's any radio guy?

2912
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:19,100
I think so. Yeah. I think he's got a
radio. I think he's a sports radio guy.

2913
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:23,310
And for him to say all I had to do was
win. Implying that he didn't have to talk.

2914
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:27,510
Like what does that say for, you know,
the Times Schulte who won the lightweight,

2915
02:50:27,540 --> 02:50:31,080
who can't speak, you know? I don't know.

2916
02:50:31,081 --> 02:50:33,900
I can't imagine where they go in three
years because they're not going to have

2917
02:50:33,901 --> 02:50:36,660
many stars. Well, it seems
like, what does it say?

2918
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:40,680
2018 one championship registered and
average of 11 million viewers per live

2919
02:50:40,681 --> 02:50:43,650
event across its core markets.
According to Nielsen.

2920
02:50:44,190 --> 02:50:45,870
That's a lot of fucking people.

2921
02:50:46,260 --> 02:50:51,240
2015 his figure was less than one
oh pop up ads got us son of a bitch.

2922
02:50:51,630 --> 02:50:56,130
2015 this figure was less than 1
million viewers per live events.

2923
02:50:56,131 --> 02:51:00,150
So in three years they went from less
than 1 million viewers per live event to

2924
02:51:00,151 --> 02:51:04,320
11 million viewers per live event.
That's fucking amazing.

2925
02:51:04,990 --> 02:51:07,230
Of course,
across its core markets.

2926
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:13,200
The article was comparing it
to Mba viewership in Asia.

2927
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:16,980
Dramatic increase in TV viewership.
Fantastic.

2928
02:51:17,640 --> 02:51:19,860
Can't be more happy. Hope they
keep growing. I hope they,

2929
02:51:19,890 --> 02:51:24,420
I hope they develop like real legit
stars and also they have legit world

2930
02:51:24,421 --> 02:51:26,970
championships across every
combat sport over there.

2931
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:31,560
They've got yachts and Caroline is doing,
he's doing all the time. I saw that.

2932
02:51:31,561 --> 02:51:35,550
Yeah. Nicky hold skin is doing kickboxing
over there. I saw that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2933
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:36,810
They're,
I mean they're,

2934
02:51:37,080 --> 02:51:41,790
they're bringing in world beaters
and bay basically every discipline.

2935
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:45,870
Yeah. I mean, I love it. I mean,
you know, we, we both have a field,

2936
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:49,380
our affiliation with the UFC,
but like without the other organizations,

2937
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:54,090
the game don't last. Exactly. The game
can't last. Exactly. It's so critical.

2938
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:56,460
It's so critical that
there's more opportunities.

2939
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:59,880
And then also it raises the
level of the UFC as well.

2940
02:51:59,881 --> 02:52:04,350
Raises everybody rising tide raises
all boats. Yeah. Really does.

2941
02:52:04,590 --> 02:52:06,100
Hopefully EOC kind of take a page

2942
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:10,330
from what I've seen does the weight
thing. I would love it. They sports,

2943
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:11,260
I'm into that.
But yeah.

2944
02:52:11,330 --> 02:52:13,690
Were trying to figure out what to
do about weight cutting. I mean,

2945
02:52:13,691 --> 02:52:15,770
they really are. They're trying
to figure it out. And, um,

2946
02:52:15,880 --> 02:52:19,420
I brought to their attention the
one fc plan, how the one fc does it.

2947
02:52:19,421 --> 02:52:22,250
They basically eliminated, everybody
goes up await, you know, they,

2948
02:52:22,251 --> 02:52:25,600
they moved every champion up a weight
class. They do hydration chests.

2949
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:30,220
They find out what your actual weight is
and they don't let you fuck around and

2950
02:52:30,221 --> 02:52:33,210
you fight it. What you really way, I
mean that's really what it should do.

2951
02:52:33,490 --> 02:52:34,960
And if you need to be
in a lighter way class,

2952
02:52:34,961 --> 02:52:39,710
guess what fat boy tell him to
fucking get on a bike. But listen man,

2953
02:52:40,510 --> 02:52:42,820
do it again next year to try
and get next year. I love that.

2954
02:52:42,821 --> 02:52:43,990
Like the beginning of the year.

2955
02:52:43,990 --> 02:52:47,360
This is what you're going away and
fight it for a year. Stay here. Yeah.

2956
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:51,220
If you don't like it next year fucking
get another weight class. That's right.

2957
02:52:51,950 --> 02:52:55,720
All right dude. We stayed
three hours. Damn crazy.

2958
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:59,470
Time flies by the time you see how that
is. We finally did it. We finally did.

2959
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:01,600
I'm standing,
we are here for like 30 minutes,

2960
02:53:02,230 --> 02:53:05,200
15 minutes and let's do it
again man. Yeah man. Listen.

2961
02:53:05,740 --> 02:53:10,740
Give everybody your social media
dresses at Dean Thomas at the I n t I,
