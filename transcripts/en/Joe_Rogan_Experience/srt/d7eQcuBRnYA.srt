1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,830
Here we go. Three, two,
one. My phone's off.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,470
Oh, we're live. Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,420
This is a fight companion podcast.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,250
If you've ever listened
to one of these before,

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,510
oftentimes we don't even watch the fights,
but we're talking some more things.

6
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:19,830
Yes, but we're watching the fights.
Certainly at least some of the time.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,560
There's more to life than fight.
Did you guys decide to go?

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,770
Did you call each other and say, let's,
let's double blast with the Lilac,

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:29,700
or is that just quizzes? Just luck to
happy coincidence. Geniuses were purple.

10
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:31,530
I just decided to wear a purple.
I got here,

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,470
he's wearing purple and he's got a
fucking purple car, so he doubled purple.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,330
Oh yeah. Well, that car,
if you're against me now,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,820
I've read that Lilac,

14
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,800
and I'm going to call that Lilac is
actually a head Turner with the ladies.

15
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,140
They're drawn to the color. Really? Yes.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,900
So they say if you're going to go out on
a date or you're going to go out on the

17
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,920
town, you might want to throw some
lilac on your body, or maybe ladies,

18
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:55,830
we'll see the lilac and think
you're trying too hard. Maybe,

19
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,340
but it suits my eye and I can't
take my eyes off your torso,

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,750
but yet you don't like
his car, his car. Well,

21
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,920
you told Joe that allows, let's get rid
of that. Yeah. Well that he doesn't know.

22
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,401
He looks,
he goes,

23
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,760
what do you have a wing on the back and
I finished her decubitus ask down. Fuck.

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,620
Well we don't need that fan. I do. They
actually make your touring package. Hey,

25
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,080
the gt three. You just attacked
my personage of the windbreaker.

26
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
I mean he's like one of them.
Jogging Dad. No, I'm not. I'm John.

27
00:01:23,191 --> 00:01:26,310
I'm an athlete and athletes keep their
muscles but educate them on the wing. No,

28
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,270
the wing keeps the acid down. That's
what it does. It's dying for us.

29
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,280
But here's my card.

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,740
How come you bought a car in La
traffic where you got to keep the acid?

31
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,990
Wilson traffic, but no, I
have one of those two. Right.

32
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,620
You know I have one with a wing gt three
Rs tale. Isn't that what they're called?

33
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:45,300
No, that's different. The whale tail
is like a, it's like, it's different.

34
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,090
It's like the turbos.
They had a whale tail.

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,350
It's like a flat looking kind of
thing that is a part of the rear deck.

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,430
This is lifted above the
rear deck and actual tail.

37
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,440
It's more, it is more effective than
they have whale tails anymore. No,

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,150
the whale tails went out with the
1993 turbo. Expensive to buy now.

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,680
I guess he could look in a whale, tail,
cars, cars, cars like that. Our instinct,

40
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:13,710
because it's like the psychologic
thing for all guys. It's like,

41
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,940
at least I know I have the power under
my hood. I'm never going to use it,

42
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:21,000
but I know I still have a Tesla.
We all want to know we have it.

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,450
Listen to what you're just doing. What
that text data mail bro. No, not know.

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,040
Just cause I'm in a windbreaker.
Right? Is there a Beta common? No.

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,170
Uh, drive the totality, Bro.

46
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,620
If you drive fast,

47
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:39,600
it's literally results in hundreds of
pounds of downforce fast and you don't

48
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,340
have to drive that fast
to feel the difference.

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,450
Have you ever been out of second
gear in that car? Of course.

50
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:48,210
Who'd have to go very fast
policing? Listening. I really do.

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,860
You Beta irresponsible,

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,540
but you have to that fucking Tesla that
thinks fast as shit. I, well my buddy,

53
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:58,860
you know France cap that Frank Grillo
has the hatch to put the headphones talk

54
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,390
over other,
he's got that dodge.

55
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,360
Um, here's a challenge or horsepower.
He has like a Hellcat that souped up.

56
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,620
Oh yeah, I beat him. What you
saying? I beat him off the line.

57
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,380
Posts of your racing irresponsibly
on the streets. Children,

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,880
my traffic fast and furious
started revving his engine.

59
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,100
Don't rev your engine at me. I'm
good. But if you rev your engine,

60
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:20,290
I mean I'll meet you halfway and
carry your engine. Doesn't even,

61
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:24,220
rev was actually just just be cool
about it. I let him make his noise.

62
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,650
We're going to get from it.
You're going to get that new roadster,

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,020
the one that they launched
into space soap as fuck.

64
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,870
You're going to get out of it.
He's got a 600 mile range.

65
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,080
It's lighter and they have more room
for batteries and they're more efficient

66
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,910
with the battery software and everything
is a problem with the test of the

67
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,010
roses. It looks cool. The
roads still looks dope.

68
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:49,800
It looks like a combination of a
Ferrari and Lotus. You never seen it?

69
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,360
No. Pull up that uh, that,

70
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,780
my problem with the Tesla right now is
that the battery doesn't last long enough.

71
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,540
It just doesn't have anywhere
to charge it. Get better though.

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,470
Like the newer ones that every year to
get better, better, better. There it is.

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,540
It can handle it. It's pretty
dope. Handle space that roof up.

74
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,240
Put the roof down. Shame. You draw a
picture of the roof down. Kids call it,

75
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:14,320
get the titties out. They
get that Sun. 1.9 seconds,

76
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,270
1.9 seconds. 60 that's a demon.
That car will make your fucking rs.

77
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:23,530
Porsche.
Watch your slow like mine.

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,450
We'll get one nine seconds. Zero to 60.
That is a dope call. Can I, you know what?

79
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,230
250 miles an hour to 21 mile range.

80
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,010
It just doesn't do it for me to
do it for you. Hope that car,

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,960
I need a v 10 I need a Fucking v
eight you have an inline say line six.

82
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,990
I need something pretty gnarly though.
Look at that.

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm getting that is just so I can be fast
on Brendan, just so I can laugh at you.

84
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:51,130
You'll be a lot faster. You could
drive that car to Vegas, dude,

85
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:56,090
off in that car. I wouldn't, I
wouldn't do that unless he was wearing

86
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,780
less. He was, I don't know
man. I just can't get behind
the electric car. You will.

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,230
Well, you've seen the Porsche. You've
seen the Porsche Electric car coming out.

88
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,420
If it's going to do it, it
can be Porsche, Porsche.

89
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:11,260
It looks like dog shit compared to
that dude, I don't test anymore.

90
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,700
How much does that tie can tilt the no
worse than tiny all electric one that

91
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,840
looks like shit, but Jamie
bring that shit up. Porsche,

92
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,730
I think it's called a tie can or
something like that. Take hat. It looks.

93
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:24,550
It looks very similar to that, but
way cooler. How much is that tissue?

94
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,780
How much of that roadster?
Tesla,

95
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,370
they don't know yet because it hasn't
been released, but 200 200 yeah,

96
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,190
look at that. What? That
does not look nearly.

97
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,720
That's a nice give us.

98
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:38,590
The test kept pretty similar
but it's a beautiful car.

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,610
Looks way better and I'm
not saying because my good
friend Ilan Musk makes it by

100
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:47,260
the way, we're good friends. Oh my God, I
liked it. That's not doe text each other.

101
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,790
Do you on Musk? I'm his friend is your
best friend. It's got bottom o'clock.

102
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,720
See that clock over there? I got him one
of those. Oh Shit. Tgt Studios clogging.

103
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,130
No big deal.
I think I've nothing weird about that.

104
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,540
Don't be scared of that wheat does.

105
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,120
He still trying to build that subway
underneath that mother fucker is trying to

106
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,780
sell everything. He if you, if
you like talk to him in private.

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,250
I wish I could try his brain out for a
day and find out what's going on in there

108
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,950
but it's just rattling around
information constantly.

109
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,951
Things are flying around and grabbing it
and stuffing it into boxes and digging

110
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,920
holes under the ground and shooting
things to the moon. He's just, he just,

111
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,060
his brain just doesn't stop.
He's single. He is now hollow.

112
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,910
When you talked to guys like
that who are lateral thinkers,

113
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,840
like you realize like the guy who made
me feel really dumb and almost like a

114
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,290
fraud was Brendan shop, not
breading shop. Peter Teal.

115
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,380
I tell I was listening to him
talk and I went, yeah, I met him,

116
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,270
I had dinner with at his house and I,
and I was like,

117
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,890
he was talking and I realized
that everything I say is
basically an amalgam of

118
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:47,420
the things I've read or heard.

119
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,990
And these guys are the ones
who write those things.

120
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,800
He just thinks up things on his own.

121
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,180
He started paypal with you on God. Damn.
That's all those boys got rich. Yeah.

122
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,140
Paypal. It's one of the ways, well,
whenever you think you're a black belt,

123
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:04,800
you realize you're a white belt. There
you go. By Pat, I shit. To me he's pushed.

124
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,880
Ilan. Ilan went on the podcast.
When you ask them a question though,

125
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:12,470
he really downloaded that data before you
gave it. Oh boy. He's long pauses. He's,

126
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,120
he's, I would say he's
very, uh, he's enthusiastic.

127
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,820
Almost like a child was certain
things that with his blow torch, guns,

128
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:20,600
stuff like that.

129
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,600
But when it comes to thinking about
things like he'll just sit down and pause

130
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:26,840
before he gives you an answer.

131
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,820
He wants to like really consider smart
cause I just go and then fucking Tesla.

132
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,983
He's thoughtless.

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,530
But that's also one of the charms of
you is that you say stupid shit that you

134
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:40,040
wish you didn't say right after you said
it. Right? Right after he said, I know.

135
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,700
He's like, God damn. I
probably should have said that.
Yeah, my tie crusher. Yeah,

136
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,170
but look how well it's going.
Yeah.

137
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,340
I mean you do a showtime special fucking
two and a half years into comedy.

138
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,680
Not even right.
How many years in the comedy,

139
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,220
but I just want to film it to and
change to and change at south sac.

140
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,100
That's outstanding. I say stick
with what got you to the dance.

141
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,600
That's exactly right. Verbal diarrhea
just keeps going until I get assassinated.

142
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,000
Fascinating. Things will get sick. Yeah,
it's going to be fixed on the wall.

143
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,900
You're saying funny shit.
Why do you think you'd get assassinated?

144
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,530
Mad Shit. Which guy? I say crazy shit.
What's the referee wearing? The referees?

145
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,310
Like wearing something around his
waist punch? No, no, no. It's like a,

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,960
it's an electronics are
sleazebags a fanny pack. Is it?

147
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,610
And maybe she has a fat Dick Cause he
know. See what I'm saying? Both sides.

148
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:32,570
He's carrying something. It looks like in
the front. Maybe it is a fanny pack. Um,

149
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,000
Tim, we don't know who's fighting
Jane Lane. Jinguang is a bean.

150
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,360
The Chinese a water.
Yes he is.

151
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,440
Is he in UFC folks watching at home?

152
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,770
Four minutes and 37363530430 three
seconds into the first round.

153
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,280
Dude. Fuck this card. If it
ain't chuck Tito. Oh Shit.

154
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,280
Well they find it today,
right? Guess? Yeah,

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,520
that's fine.
They're fighting tonight.

156
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,410
Is there an undercard for that or are
they just in a car with great shape,

157
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,940
right? Yes. They both look in
great shape. Chuck has a gigantic,

158
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:13,560
a vein across his bicep. They've been
tested to consign pretty straight.

159
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,670
Always had that like kind of his belly
always sticks out. We call it the power.

160
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,450
God's power gut.

161
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,480
He's always had that even when he was
at the top of the food chain yet when he

162
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,920
was the best light heavyweight. Oh
Shit. So water clipped him. Damn.

163
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:30,600
Jim Lang. Even when chuck was at the top
of the food chain, he always had that. Oh,

164
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,120
it's just, that's just how he's
built. He's just built odd.

165
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,000
Tito was pointing at it. It was really
funny. He was like making fun of him.

166
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:39,520
But he was wearing a shirt.
Yeah, he didn't have, it
didn't make any sense. Strange.

167
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,270
You were in a shirt.
The whole thing's been a little strange.

168
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,010
I think they should have done like a,

169
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,820
cause those guys should go out on their
shields as hall of famers. I think.

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,600
I wish you know trucks had, when they
wanted to do the fight he called Dana.

171
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,760
Dane was like, get the fuck out. It
ain't happening. Good luck though.

172
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,260
And so I wish they were done like a tough
finale or like a big card and they're

173
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:02,550
just like a feature of
shit. Aye. Aye. Aye Support.

174
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:05,640
Everyone's right to do whatever they
want to do whenever they want to do it.

175
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,830
As long as they're not hurting anybody.
And this goes into that, right.

176
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,390
I support your right to bull ride.

177
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,900
I support your right to sky dive
and do whatever you want to do, man.

178
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,510
And if these guys like what is,
what are, what is our thought?

179
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,760
And if they don't do this, they're going
to live forever. No, I mean they, they,

180
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,160
they know the risks. They're big boys.
Yep. You know the real question is like

181
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,840
should they be doing it and went through
all the testing because I said I truck

182
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,060
into both on my show.
I asked Chuck,

183
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm like you've gone through all the
testing with commission California.

184
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,370
Cause when I was fighting going
through California commissions,

185
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:36,630
they are by far the strictest.

186
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,630
You do not want to fight here if you're
taking protein powder, they're the worst.

187
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,330
Chuck's like I went through all
the California commission shit.

188
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,070
I'm like damn well I'm everything.

189
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,320
I'm a big fan of this guy who runs it
in California. Andy Foster, he's obese.

190
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,530
He's really on top of the ball. He's
super proactive. He's really smart.

191
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,740
He used to fight himself lifelong martial
artists for respect for the sport up,

192
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,260
super progressive about
people's weight cuts.

193
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,410
It doesn't want people cutting a
shitload of weight in his state.

194
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,220
He tries to monitor their hydration,
wants to get your weight out in advance.

195
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,400
He's ahead of it with everything.
He's not a dinosaur. He said no,

196
00:11:11,401 --> 00:11:13,140
he's ahead of it.
Also with weight classes,

197
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,110
they instituted more weight
classes in California for early on.

198
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:18,360
So you guys aware of
how one FC does there?

199
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,540
When I talked about how did they do that
and ask how do they do it? They don't.

200
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,530
There's no weight cutting man. There's
no way cutting. They do hydration tests.

201
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,730
They do hydration tests. You fight
whatever is closest to your natural way,

202
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:33,880
which I think makes a move there.

203
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,620
The one fc 100% is doing it
better than anybody else.

204
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,960
Hundred percent you know the problem with
that is though something, well Connie,

205
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,790
yes, they stopped the weight cutting.
It's not necessarily, it's the division.

206
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,490
So the division is what you weigh what's,

207
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:51,030
so Ben her and went up to one 85 he was
one 70 and they jumped him up to one 85

208
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,830
which is like his real walk around
weight, you know, and he's still,

209
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,910
and they determine what that weight is.
There's this,

210
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,670
there's gotta be an official
land has got to be, look,

211
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,050
you could always manipulate your weight
and stay healthy within a certain range

212
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:06,290
of your discipline. They say can you
would still be hydrated. So if you like,

213
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,290
say if you said your best weight is one
65 you just decided that all you would

214
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:14,320
have to do is make sure you got your
body weight down and do it over a long

215
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:17,980
period of time so that you're, you know,
you're doing cardio, you're eating right,

216
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:20,320
you're making sure and then
keep your weight in that range.

217
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,430
Like you could decide to fluctuate 10
pounds one way or the other and still be

218
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,330
fairly healthy.

219
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,800
It's just a matter of how much certain
kinds of exercise you do and how much

220
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:33,370
time. But the thing about
the certain kinds exercises,
once people got some power,

221
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,030
they don't want to give that power up.
Right.

222
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,050
And if you're like one 75 but jacked and
you really would be better off one 65

223
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,430
but a little thinner,
you know like cardio wise,

224
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,620
a lot of guys don't want to give
up that path. But also, you know,

225
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,040
some guys are huge for their weight
class and for whatever reason like there

226
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,920
until, and who's the guy in
Baltimore who, who lost Rory,

227
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:54,620
mark them in the first title fight,
Rory Macdonald, Lima, Lima, he,

228
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,310
those guys are giant for their way.
Class East.

229
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:00,100
And I think sometimes some
people have the kind of body,

230
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,760
like some people have
a body like they have,

231
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,230
they have their two 30 but their weight
on their ass and legs and they have

232
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,050
small upper bodies. And maybe
that's not as good as someone like,

233
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:12,910
I don't know who has like
there until [inaudible] until
that's all well and good.

234
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,980
But the real thing should
be what do you really weigh?

235
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:19,270
All the other stuff is bullshit.
All the other stuff is just,

236
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:22,090
we've just agreed upon this cause we've
been doing it this way for so long.

237
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,870
It should be get to a healthy weight.
What do you way,

238
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,410
and there's gotta be more weight class
from a wrestling background. Right?

239
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,820
We're getting all, there's copy and
roasting the hydration. They, they um,

240
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,080
they make you urinate and they check
your urine and they check the weight of

241
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,460
your urine.
That's one of the ways.

242
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,390
There's a bunch of different sophisticated
ways to do it, but they, yeah,

243
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,980
because the more minerals and the
more stuff is in your, your urine,

244
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,650
it indicates how much water you have
in your body. Like what, you know,

245
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,210
what percentage of of water
you have in your body,

246
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:57,460
whether or not you're dehydrated.
Just make sure that I'm,

247
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,540
I might be wrong about that.
Double up on the P uh, uh, clear.

248
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,220
That means you're more hydrated.
Yes.

249
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,720
But it doesn't necessarily know if
you've taken a bunch of vitamins,

250
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,070
you can still peek dark yellow.
My Shit will be tucked

251
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,060
to and some of it does
come out in your urine,

252
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,590
but some of it still is
getting absorbed in your body.

253
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,110
It's not all of it that's
going out in your urine.

254
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:27,140
It's still a good idea to
take multivitamins. One
FC hired a Misha Tate too.

255
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,430
I was like the, she's moving. They're
just going to move to Singapore.

256
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,210
I think it's a smart movement. She's a
smart girl. Sam is a great place to live.

257
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,070
Hey Man. I mean they might, um,

258
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,760
they might seriously be looking at
her as like a big time executive.

259
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,660
Like the female Dana White fur for Asia.
Sounds like that's what they're doing.

260
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,150
Well Rich Franklin is doing it too though,
right?

261
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,510
Isn't he have a big role over there as
well? Huge role does he do over there?

262
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,150
I'm not sure what he does,
but

263
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,130
he did.
He's got,

264
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,580
he's got like some kind of executive job
and does he live in Singapore as well?

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,930
Was headed there. They're not going to
commit to you unless you commit to them.

266
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,300
Brandon barrel just one.
Did He, was that in one ft?

267
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,200
Did you see his fight to Brian
and like two years doing it.

268
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,450
Oh monster and have you, it's
amazing dude. He looks so good.

269
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,730
Diabetes either and he wasn't
eating Olympic, a Greco guy.

270
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,800
Brandon Vera. No, he was a
very big, very high level.

271
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,690
Very good wrestler. And you know
what the funny thing is, he's really,

272
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:33,380
what he's known for is his
kickboxing. Amazing. You know,

273
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,930
he had a hard time in the UFC
dude because there was this,

274
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,040
there was this one period of time where
they were in contract negotiations and I

275
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:43,700
feel like he lost a lot of momentum there.
Cause remember he uh,

276
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,600
he beat Frank Mir,
frank man and goes and then goes,

277
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,700
I'm going to be the light heavyweight
champion and heavyweight champions. Yeah.

278
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,740
What's up and then their issues.
Yeah, he was like out for a while.

279
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,260
Long time. He got it. He knows
fucking, we came back and the didn't,

280
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:03,890
he also fight Fabricio for doom
and he got trapped under the mount,

281
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,000
wasn't it for doom? Who? Tk
outcome was it for doom. I re,

282
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,360
I remember feeling like
virgin just handled,

283
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,670
I remember you realize he had really
good Jiu Jitsu because remember he

284
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,810
submitted a us, what's that
dude's name? Brazilian cat.

285
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,850
Fuck,
I forget his name now,

286
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:24,000
but he's [inaudible] Silva
be like getting dude dude,

287
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,360
dude kills duty training.

288
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,370
I was there with him at 10 plant one
day but he was going to drop the squad.

289
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,330
He dropped in a few times but he
was also trained by a homeboy.

290
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,510
Rob Cayman. No for kickboxing, but

291
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:44,120
he was in San Diego Alliance.
He's, he doesn't last forever,

292
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,210
but he was a black belt. Who's the
black dude? Uh, Boyd Urban. Yeah,

293
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,760
exactly. He's a little boy. Brandon. Well,

294
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,340
what's crazy is how is his wrestling and
his grappling was like what you would

295
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:01,050
think if you looked at his skillset,
but it's like he,

296
00:17:01,051 --> 00:17:05,270
he just got so good at striking like
early on he was known more of a striker

297
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,650
than anything by far.

298
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,980
Do you remember when Frank Meir came
back after the motorcycle on the accent?

299
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,470
Like here's Brandon Vera and
Brandon barreling. Cool story.

300
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,980
Nay Nay and just fucked him up to my head.

301
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:21,930
Kick knock out to
like

302
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,510
in the UFC big time head kicked out,

303
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,480
knocked out Frank Mir with a
head kick who smashed his nose.

304
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:34,481
His nose got so fucked up in one fire
member knows was literally completely

305
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,310
fantastic. It was great. We
had some tough fights, man.

306
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,200
You see him soccer kid do wrong
when they let him do what.

307
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,620
I've kicked people on the ground if
first of all, he's so much, dude,

308
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:50,430
he's so jack now or soul he fought
was like other soccer kicks,

309
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:54,990
not worried June. So you're allowed to
kick that. Guys. Guys are on the ground.

310
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,690
He soccer kick drum calm water.
It's bad.

311
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,170
That's not a good look
on their back fighting.

312
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,330
But that friend,
that soccer head kicked,

313
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,970
I'll make you rethink the side your head
and think there's so much power in that

314
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,170
part of the game is probably the most
powerful kick you could do. Honestly.

315
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,910
It's like it's one of those weird kicks.

316
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,600
It doesn't really show up in martial
arts except if there, you know,

317
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:21,840
you allow someone to kick someone when
they're down because that's the only time

318
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:25,410
or ever you can generate that kind of
power because if you really think about it

319
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,450
like everything else, you've got to kind
of teach your foot to do this. Yeah,

320
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,050
you got to teach your body to do this. You
teach yourself. But this kid does that.

321
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,790
Everybody's talking
about the Charlie Brown.

322
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,110
Charlie Brown from like one foot away
and just fucked [inaudible] head.

323
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,720
He really,
everybody can do that.

324
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,090
Jamie brings Brandon verb first
of all we can somebody anyways.

325
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,430
It looks like a video game cause
he used to be flat. It was flat.

326
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,510
No Saginaw Street fighter.
Street fighter.

327
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,690
Definitely eating a lot of
steak. Yes. What do you think?

328
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:06,720
He's like two two 40 maybe.

329
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,200
Boom and that's just one.
That's just one look at this was a y.

330
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,010
Oh Jesus. But this one is
a bad, that's just one.

331
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:20,310
There's another one when he's head
kicking the guy while the guys down,

332
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:20,940
it just sucked.

333
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,960
He was like the first real like a
big time athlete that I remember.

334
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,210
But some people think that
this is a better way to
express fighting because this

335
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:34,080
is realistic,
like disagree back the head head.

336
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,820
I like Eddie guys are steady,
loves that shit too. Barbaric man.

337
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
I would like to see headbutts bring,
oh this fight is over.

338
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,630
That's Cam boot train rounds. We're not
even paying attention. It's fighter. Oh,

339
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:48,090
we're watching an extraneous fights.
This is when people get mad.

340
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,980
No one called attention to these fights.
The good fight.

341
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,560
This is actually a really good fight.
And you know,

342
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,670
UFC fight pass is working
on getting this league that,

343
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,620
I think it's in Burma where uh,
you just wrap your hands.

344
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:06,510
It's Muy Thai kickboxing with headbutts.
Yeah. Legal. What is it called?

345
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:09,900
Leche way. How'd he say it? Yeah,
it's like, it's called let, let, let,

346
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,670
let way that way or something
like that way. I think

347
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:19,020
that word [inaudible] crazy with them
in front of the ropes on their hands.

348
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,440
They wrap their hands up with something.
I'm not sure what,

349
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:25,200
I'm barely headbutts or legal holy show.

350
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,760
Frank Grillo in a fight world,

351
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:29,580
went to Cambodia and lived with
them and study with them and they,

352
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,280
the problem is they don't have
ice in Cambodia. They're so poor.

353
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,640
So when they get hit in the face and
stuff there, they just stay swollen.

354
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,300
So between rounds left way and that's why,
wonder how they search.

355
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,100
I wonder how you pronounce the shots,

356
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,650
elbows nd it against the ropes.
Boom. Just do, just drop.

357
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,010
And Are you

358
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,400
allowed hit to the back of the head? You
can do ever. I'm not sure about that.

359
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,000
You Know Eddie and I've talked about
this a hundred times, but it's,

360
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:57,490
it's an important fact that
when you watch head kicks,

361
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,030
there's a lot of the time head kicks
are lending to the back of the head.

362
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,430
Like you say, you can't hit someone
in the back of the head, right?

363
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,450
It's not supposed to be legal.

364
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,190
If I go over your shoulder
and I kick you kick in,

365
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:12,310
the back seats are Nestor who pseudo.
So two punches.

366
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:16,430
This guy at turn, it hits him, right
my fucking back. Then bring up,

367
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:18,580
bring up and there's nothing you can do.

368
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,450
Bring up Ernesto host when he hits a
Maurice Greene myth. And Maury Smith.

369
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,320
Yeah Dude.

370
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:26,860
He wrapped his head around your fucking
head and his neck just goes around your

371
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:31,450
head. His neck. Just why? Oh,
that was um, that was tough.

372
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,260
I was good friends with Maurice
when that was going on. Maurice was,

373
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,890
was fighting when,
you know,

374
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:40,810
he probably shouldn't have been done
doing the demos finest Ernesto host is,

375
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:41,530
you know,

376
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,550
but I mean he was fighting like pro
kickbox and what he's also doing MMA and

377
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:49,210
like Maurice is a worldclass kickboxer
but I really think for you to fight a guy

378
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:50,170
like Ernesto hoost,

379
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,410
you kind of have to be kickbox and all
the time and we'll see what he does.

380
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,290
Yeah.

381
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,290
And Maurice like for real was
a super skilled world champion.

382
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,470
Kickboxer but he had been doing,
oh my God.

383
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,820
How do you look at that? He lifts
his watch. This dude, he was so good.

384
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,640
It's perfect. Numbers. Fights
against Bob Sapp. Yeah, Dude.

385
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:18,460
His fucking leg kicks man. They're the
best at the way he punches though. Yeah,

386
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,180
he bought, he did everything awesome.
The thing about him didn't you know.

387
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:25,100
Here's another one. Look at him now.
Look it. He looks like a super fight.

388
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:25,931
A game too,
right?

389
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:29,500
Doesn't he look like some kind of
video game character in these images?

390
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:34,150
Well then show to him early in his
career he was a bag of bones man.

391
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,570
Really? Yeah, he was skinny.
What do you think your

392
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,380
diet for real?
He was real thin.

393
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,720
He was very long and almost
like style bender like great.

394
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,140
Then he got Super Jack
later in the cro cop dude,

395
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:54,010
his leg kicks were sensational. How
about with Bob? Sat beat him twice.

396
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,940
That was a real fight. Fuck
you. That feels real to me.

397
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,540
To add pop SAP is a giant human being.
[inaudible] 75 it's

398
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,950
a lot of fights. He's right. It
bumps up out the fuck up shoulder.

399
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,210
Was it Ernesto?
I don't remember.

400
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:14,080
They kept hitting it and that's what
stopped the fight. No, no, no, no, no.

401
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,110
That was a different fight. I think you're
thinking of a different phone. I'm not.

402
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,860
One of them had a really fucked up
shoulder and he kept kicking it and he was

403
00:23:19,861 --> 00:23:21,580
like, Nesto kip king.
He was like, no, no, no.

404
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,570
Pretty sure that's Bob had to be one that
he lost because he won the two fights

405
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,930
that he had against her Nesto that
I'm aware of. Box I did, didn't he?

406
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:31,170
Eddie pops have beat her Nesto yeah.

407
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,750
I told her I don't remember the second
fight or if they even fought twice or

408
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:40,330
three times. I guess I just
remember Bob up beating him.

409
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,740
Do you know when you
really think about it, man?

410
00:23:41,741 --> 00:23:44,200
You know Maury Smith worked
with Bob Sapp as well,

411
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,980
taught him a lot about kickboxing,
but when

412
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,711
you think about it more,

413
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:51,711
Reese was like the first real high level
kickboxer to become successful at MMA.

414
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,050
Yup. Right. The first world champion,

415
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:57,020
when you remember when he fought
Conan Silvera and head kicked him,

416
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,900
everybody was like, you can't beat
a Brazilian jujitsu black belt.

417
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:03,770
You're definitely not going to beat him.
And by Coleman Coleman Dude,

418
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:07,490
and he was so as I we were at.
That's why it's against, right.

419
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:12,080
We were there together. God Damn.
I remember being so 1996 the shit,

420
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,000
right? 96 97 I think it was 97 97 it might
have even been [inaudible] 98 he kept

421
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:21,860
saying, come on, come on,
come on. Who's come on mark.

422
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,660
How many come granted pounding
and you saw and you saw it.

423
00:24:26,661 --> 00:24:29,070
Mark at one point got
kicked one too many times.

424
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,730
It's just wet stopped and everybody went,
oh, you know he's like down Maury Smith.

425
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,573
A couple of terms.

426
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,870
Problem was Maury Smith has
a very good defensive guard,

427
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,750
high level recovery and like he
doesn't really attack cardio.

428
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,850
He's also working with you
work with Frank Shamrock,

429
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,700
first friends with shamrock.

430
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,520
He was also an easy two 30 like
just a natural Django land.

431
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,380
He actually played locked down too.
Yeah. Yeah, he did. Yeah. Look,

432
00:24:57,381 --> 00:24:59,810
Maury Smith is a smart guy and his,

433
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:04,900
his kickboxing was so high level man when
he started fighting these MMA fighters

434
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:08,810
and they realized that he could
defend himself off of his back,

435
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,910
but if you're standing up with
him, you're just fucked man. Yeah.

436
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:16,100
The problem was Mark Coleman wasn't never
really worked on is guard passing back

437
00:25:16,101 --> 00:25:17,450
then. You know what I mean? He just,

438
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,140
he just assumed that when
you take someone down,

439
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,210
you just get on top of them
and beat the shit out of him.

440
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,430
But that's true if you
don't have any kind of card.

441
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,010
But Maurice Smith had a professional
defensive guard. Yeah. Yeah.

442
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,060
And also this is the headbutt
days. I was headbutt days. Yeah.

443
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah. When I don't think they feel
different. They aren't gloves.

444
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,420
You would over hook here. They has loves,
right? Oh yeah, they definitely had kick.

445
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,000
Do you remember the gut,
the guard,

446
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,000
the most important guard position when
there's headbutts are allowed? Grabbed,

447
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:54,050
grabbed the back of the
head? No. Did he won

448
00:25:55,650 --> 00:26:00,430
when I've got sidekick or the
fully straight to the gut. Damn.

449
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,100
He's a nice man. He's got some
great fights in the UFC. Man.

450
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,790
John Jones dropped Vito Belfort with
the front leg side kick one off,

451
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,700
some amazing, I'd never seen that.
It was a front leg side kick.

452
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,940
One of the most underrated kicks.
People just don't do it that good.

453
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,740
Do you think v two or bell force
cage side tonight with chucked him,

454
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,660
rushes the cage and says, uh, I
wouldn't fight both you pussies,

455
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,600
but he's just fucking juice to
the gills. And we're like, yeah,

456
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,560
it probably will happen. They'd let
them if the UFC let them go over there,

457
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,320
if they load the right,
I've been Dana.

458
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,180
Well it and they'll put,
they'll have him too, you know,

459
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:38,570
if they just got to regulate medications,

460
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,180
make sure that everything's okay.
Come on.

461
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,250
I mean if they're testing chuck and Tito,
you gotta Test v Torque ticket.

462
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,210
Can't beat your campaign.
Kelly, let's not do that. Okay,

463
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,480
well it's only having five and like,
let's get me on an Indian reservation.

464
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,240
It was this, I don't want anyone
70 what's happening? Yeah.

465
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,460
Is a lightweight one seven
years, dude. How about Walter?

466
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,080
Wherever Hudson Nibia virtue.
Neil magnesium and he looked really,

467
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,660
maybe it was a real problem.
He looks really good. Good
man. He looks really good.

468
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,060
Maggie, I don't know if it's
the jet lag or why he's my boy,

469
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:12,660
but he was a late start and he had eight
the fuck up. Yeah. He got chewed up.

470
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,200
You got chewed up, poked in the
eye like early in the first round.

471
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,680
Then he just couldn't decide like depth.
He had no idea what to do.

472
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:24,140
So he's just always like waiting room.
That's a real problem. And you know they,

473
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,250
there is a solution in the works.
I can't talk about it. I'm a proxy.

474
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,980
I pokes goggles. Yeah,
no they fell. It's there.

475
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:36,160
But I have a better glove design that
they're working on it. But someone

476
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,710
said to try and kick,
oh hands dude.

477
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:45,250
I also heard they're doing something
about a room or is the super room right

478
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:48,870
star anything. You saw it in
2009 I'd be like permanently,

479
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
really boom,

480
00:27:51,361 --> 00:27:54,630
leave that side kick to the
body and then nasty left hands.

481
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,190
You mean they might get rid of you sat
and we're back to old days. It's crazy.

482
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,890
I don't know if they were getting
rid of it. Maybe a little.

483
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,870
That is so crazy.
Sidekick to the body,

484
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,030
but especially the way he threw it.
I mean he really got his weight behind it.

485
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:14,520
You could fuck people up with
that man set of lips on them.

486
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,330
It's like we all accept that the front
leg side or the turning side kick or

487
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,390
spinning back kick, we all accept
that puts people out. Right.

488
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,950
Well how much harder is you're turning
side kicked in your front leg side kick

489
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,160
way harder. Yeah, but significantly.

490
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,300
But how much does it take really to make
your body cave in? Because my front leg,

491
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,690
sorry, is way harder than
my left hook. Way Harder.

492
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,810
Your front foot front lakeside.
Really? So yeah. So if you,

493
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:41,700
if you think like of course you can left,

494
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,160
took someone in the body and
dropped them and fuck them up bad,

495
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,180
he hit him and liver.
Right?

496
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,210
Well why wouldn't you to think that you
could do that also with the front leg

497
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:49,960
side kick on a regular basis.
Yeah.

498
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,970
He's got to have a quicker snap to it
takes what most a long time to develop.

499
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:55,380
That's the prize it takes.

500
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:59,010
You got to develop that quick snap
and that's what most guys are missing.

501
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,460
Most guys that comes out to slow the body,

502
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,620
the body's about is more designed for
I left hook that you can keep the power

503
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:08,010
and yet I fuck probably till you're in
your sixties versus from from Thai kick

504
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:12,420
is an athletic move. Touch the state is
definitely no headway to kick that much.

505
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,283
No.

506
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,830
Well it's really definitely a con a
little bit but not like great is some fit

507
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,600
kit is a good kicker. Yeah.
Yeah. But nothing like crazy. No,

508
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,090
nothing like a cro cop type character.
Huh? There's no one in the, uh,

509
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,460
there's no one in the UFC for the big
guys. There's really not. That's a kicker.

510
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,080
Who else? Well, this must be
someone we're not thinking of.

511
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:36,230
Marcin Tibora kicks a lot,
but he's not like a stadium kids.

512
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,250
Not like a heavyweight. Barboza there's
no like just monster with the kids.

513
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,000
Yeah. I was hoping that was going to be
a something we would acquire it. Right.

514
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,990
Like get some sort of Rico
Verhoeven type character. Yeah.

515
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:56,140
Kathy's fighting MMA and he's trained
at Aka well listen, standup wise for,

516
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:01,141
he's on not just one level but so
many levels above most people in MMA.

517
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,960
Rachel for Hoover in,
it's a mine as far as strict up,

518
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:09,400
but that doesn't always
tremble. It doesn't translate
now. It doesn't translate.

519
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:13,400
You gotta have you gotta like the distance
is different. The timing, your stance.

520
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,620
Verhoeven is something special.
And he's a, he's a big giant guy.

521
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,280
Have you ever seen right now crazy
because he had obviously a Dutch guy,

522
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,020
giant milk fed Dejak Sadie.
Really? Yeah, he's uh,

523
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,520
he's about 240 plus pounds
and the guy has mad cardio.

524
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:31,900
It's one of the crazy things about him.

525
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,780
He puts a crazy pace on these
guys and he's a striker.

526
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:38,770
Have you seen some of his MMA fights? No.
Who the fuck is finding that poor soul?

527
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,620
I mean, he just area have mercy. You
want some of that be fuck is going on.

528
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:46,570
So I'm like, yeah, see if you
can find out. Oh, I mean I'd use,

529
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:49,480
I'd have to use my kicks dude.
And he's like, hey, hey, be,

530
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:52,960
and he's got an AK training
with DC. Hey guys, I've sparked.

531
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,380
Oh Bro, what the fuck are
you showing us, Jamie?

532
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,720
Don't put it out by three is boy,

533
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,310
he's like a giant Dutchman to
try and find a highlight reel.

534
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:10,740
Final highlight reel. Wow. He's a monster
dude. Oh my Lord. And great hair too.

535
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,880
And he's a young guy who's fine.
I mean,

536
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,180
I don't even know if all
behind that survived two beats
of the best in the world.

537
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,740
If all the guy, nothing. You
guys not having big contract,

538
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:22,350
my uncle now you can take a beating.

539
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,880
Now that big guy is supposed
to be super tough for sure.

540
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,970
It looks at people like that kind of shit.
You know,

541
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:32,830
it's like oof capable of when
big Roy wins by knockout.

542
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,870
They trust.
Yes,

543
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:39,060
they do look at that and it weird
like I must do fucking tons of cardio,

544
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,030
but he just, the gut just stay.
Just ate the wrong food, Bro.

545
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,210
Look at that fucking Combo.
But look at his kicks man.

546
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,800
I mean Ricoh over who don't
go to go to his MMA fight.

547
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:55,150
Some guy gets fucking starched and you,
you can't, he's not finding experienced,

548
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,510
wait, wait, what are you doing? What
are you doing? Who's running this shit?

549
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,620
Then you can't listen. I'm all over
the place. Jamie kicks herself.

550
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,800
You want to try to watch some of this
stuff? Knees kicks. Oh, Jesus Christ.

551
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,380
Jesus Christ is right.
How old is he?

552
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,550
I don't even think he's 30 17 boom.
He's 15 years old.

553
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,640
If I had no, he's Dutch.
15 if I had to guess,

554
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:22,930
I would say he's like 29 how old is he?
Stays in his thirties yep. Can't check it.

555
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,820
That's it. The tallest
people in the world, right?

556
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:28,510
They're the biggest people in the world
in general. Are they the giant people?

557
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,850
I don't know if they're the biggest
people in the world, but they add heard.

558
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,500
They're the tallest people in the world.
Dude,

559
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,390
I'd love to see him and Alistair Overeem.
Go on

560
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,770
a big boy.
I wish she would take them down for sure.

561
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,640
The officers are very good grappling that
Alister would definitely stand up with

562
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:46,130
them for a little bit, for sure. Which
is what he does, but he would uh,

563
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,700
take them down. Alster very underrated
grappler. Oh, amazing grappler. Yeah.

564
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,110
And it's grounded. Pam will fuck
you up. It's a real problem.

565
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,220
It's used. Don't feel as guilty for
a little bit. Yeah. And it's also,

566
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:02,780
he's just had so many more MMA fights
deciding for a hundred years. Yeah.

567
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,990
He's good at everything. But
Verhoeven was it. He has it.

568
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,520
He has an advantage over basically
everything. Now in heavyweight,

569
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,390
Saki has that smooth bill too, where
you just like, you know what? Oh my God,

570
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,810
I get it. But what's interesting is Saki,
what is he fighting? One 85 in the UFC.

571
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,430
Yeah, but you should be at one
80 fiber. Yeah, that's, yeah.

572
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:25,760
That's what it is, right? Yeah. He
should be finding five. What's that bro?

573
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,850
29 29 years old.
29 years old.

574
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:33,220
He in the UFC yet or no, no, no.

575
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,520
He's making his way through, you
know, smaller organizations was,

576
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:41,990
so show me one of his MMA fights. Holy
Shit. He fights on her ma. Yes Bro.

577
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,640
Some poor soul whose
fighting him? Rico. Rico.

578
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:51,310
Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a real problem
and he's training with Cain and what?

579
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,880
DEVINCI heavyweight. Why every bit of
huge dude. I mean he's like six, four.

580
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,480
You better get that Jujitsu. He's about
six [inaudible] four. He's a big boy.

581
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:04,460
Big Boy. Big Boy. And two 40 jacked.
Don't let this go a natural shape.

582
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,150
Maybe. Yeah, maybe not. Yeah,
maybe. Right. Maybe Stryker's come.

583
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:13,940
It's wait and see what happens at
Jujitsu together. Oh, for sure.

584
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:17,780
Right? Yeah. What do you
think is happening? Uh, again,

585
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:21,080
Broomer on super dark
web. Rumor is that, uh,

586
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,650
there's gonna be a change with
Usada moving forward a little bit.

587
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,890
Is this him, Jamie and this
video, the other video.

588
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,360
Oh Shit. He took the guy down. Nice. Maybe
he's good at Jujitsu. He's an athlete.

589
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,110
Holy Shit. All the body. Oh Shit.

590
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:44,000
Did you do not want that guy on top of
you growing up? County looks like in here.

591
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,240
It looks like, who knows?
Maybe he's really good on the
ground. Show me that again,

592
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:51,230
Jamie. Show me the beginning part of
it again. This has been a while ago.

593
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:52,580
If done inside MMA.

594
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,020
Cool.
I feel like

595
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,040
he's still doing that high cover up.
What's your obviously worked though,

596
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,400
man. He had to take the dude down.
Yeah, that was a wild little exchange.

597
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,570
I mean that dude did not, uh, I mean
they came to throw at each other. They,

598
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,890
that guy was not avoiding them.

599
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,310
I like how he's punching the
records from the mail. Oh, does that

600
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,030
fighty starch so hard man.

601
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,450
He could hit you said whenever you get a
real striker on top of, you know, that's,

602
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,790
it actually could turned their hips.
The forest.

603
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,920
Do you remember when a cro cop got on
top of Gabriel Gonzaga? The rematch.

604
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:33,900
The revenge fight. Elbows smashed
him with elbows. They were horrific.

605
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,760
Horrific. And then who did dank? Gabriel
got good with elbows from the bottom.

606
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,420
Didn't he fuck somebody up
from the bottom? Look in,

607
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,750
look at the euro February
in his corner there.

608
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,530
Here it is. This is, this is more, more.

609
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,020
It's the same one or the video is
more recent. This is Rico Verhoeven.

610
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,710
This looks like the same fight,
isn't it?

611
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,430
I think different than how
many have you had? Is it Jane?

612
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,970
That looks like the sense of I don't
how it'd be done. This is the same. Yes.

613
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,870
I've got it for a kickboxer
not bad passing. Yeah.

614
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,660
I mean he's got to learn,
right? Hi. He's also smart.

615
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,960
So like what got him to become an elite
kickboxer that kind of intelligence as

616
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,810
well as hard work.
He's just going to translate that to MMA.

617
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,200
He's just got to make sure that
he fixes the holes in his game.

618
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Is that the right king of risk?

619
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,280
And he likes to tease out the
right Kay Kay with the wrestlers.

620
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,100
Like these are hard fucking punches,
man.

621
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:34,570
Get this clean and room for your body.
Just lifting a leg up.

622
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,620
I think only one time ever.
Maybe twice have some,

623
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,300
someone got knocked out.
Wow.

624
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:44,140
There were a while there were mounting
somebody from the bottom. Really?

625
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,430
You're saying the guy on mount got
knocked up, somebody catches up. Yeah.

626
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:51,150
It's happened maybe twice in Paris.

627
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,930
I want to keep getting knocked out
while you're being mounted. I mean,

628
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:55,660
not while you're mounted.
Sorry. Excuse me.

629
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,280
I think Duane Ludwig and when did it,

630
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,730
wasn't that something that

631
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,133
who

632
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,750
it happened in? In Japan? Yeah. Oh Man.

633
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:12,230
I'm trying to remember this. Hello?
Dwayne load weights. Fight. Yeah.

634
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,530
Why don't I feel like Duane
Ludwig Dude. Oh, Eve Edwards.

635
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,480
Duane Ludwig did it to eve Edwards.

636
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,950
He heard him like really bad and
eve like covered it up and he was,

637
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:22,791
yeah,

638
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:26,360
he was on top and Dwayne punched or from
the bottom and hurt them really bad.

639
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,180
He talked about it on the
podcast. Now I remember, dude,

640
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:32,510
how long has this fight taken to dear
to this point? What's going on here?

641
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:36,470
You feel like, well, they're a,
they're in China, so we're there at,

642
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,330
maybe they're just giving us chance
to settle in. Isn't it weird though,

643
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:43,730
isn't just China's Communist,
right?

644
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,980
That's not really, not really. No, not
really. We're a capitalist country there.

645
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,570
Are there a command economy though?

646
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:54,680
Like so where a lot of the decisions
are made by the poet bureau, by the,

647
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,240
by the actual government,

648
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,150
and then from there their flag looks
like the Soviet Union flag. Yeah.

649
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,420
Well if Chad, it's still
red China, right. It was,

650
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:07,750
there was a communist revolution. Not
Anymore though. It's weird. That is,

651
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:12,450
it's not dang shop democracy right now.
You know when I went to new Asian,

652
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,700
uh, for Abu Dhabi and in the hotels, boom,

653
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:20,270
they have the TV on with the, with
the propaganda. Oh yeah. How long ago?

654
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,460
Your tone talking shit on the
United States. Really? Yeah.

655
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,660
There it's a documentary that's on,
you know,

656
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:30,420
it's the default setting on your
TVs and in Beijing. Fuck them.

657
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,820
Get there.

658
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,860
You sit down to watch TV and a documentary
on how bad the United is is playing.

659
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,130
This

660
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,760
is, this is why we're doing what we're
doing. Look at the amount of Shelby Cobra.

661
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,370
The United States is uh,
you know,

662
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,240
they're just going down,
down the list of all the,

663
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,600
the things that the United
States does that uh,

664
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,640
when you go there for mental to society,

665
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,680
did you have to do your fingerprints
on the machine? You have to get,

666
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,230
you get all your fingerprints are
recorded and then you're given,

667
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,100
at least when I was shooting a movie, you
were given a our adjuster, right? Yeah.

668
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:03,580
You were given a memo to say if
you and no political dissent,

669
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,700
like you will not voice your political
point of view of it's contrary to the

670
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,330
government's live. I don't know why. If
you do that, you'll be asked to leave.

671
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,620
Or You could be some American
kid like try and steal something.

672
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,510
Oh yeah. That was balls.
A son [inaudible] son,

673
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,930
Ucla basketball teams stole like some
sunglasses and fucking Trump had to help

674
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:26,240
get them out. They don't fuck
around Chinese super fucked. Ooh.

675
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,670
But Dang shall Pang said
famously to be rich is glorious,

676
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,580
which was so contrary to
the communist metallurgical.

677
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,680
It's cool as fuck the UFC in there, so
it can't be that. It's a huge market.

678
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:41,680
Everybody wants the Chinese market. Well,
that's the next big push for the UFC.

679
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:44,830
Right? I mean internationally, they're
growing like you're not getting Google.

680
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,790
You know when we tried,

681
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,240
well you'd have to keep trying
to find servers that would,

682
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,610
that would provide Google and the Internet
in China because they can't get you

683
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,540
to the access of everything. Yes. And then
they find you and they shut that down.

684
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:58,450
And then you've got to find another one.
So anybody who worked on the set,

685
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,960
who anybody worked on a set couldn't
get w you're given a phone there.

686
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:05,850
So when I was an actor, I was
given a phone with WeChat. Fine.

687
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,890
It's a phone issue to
me that I can use there.

688
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,550
I can't use technically my phone
and link into the worldwide web.

689
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,290
Too many firewalls. Yeah,
they you, and then by the way,

690
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,530
if you want to use your phone,
you download something called Wechat,

691
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,760
which is an APP which you know,
is controlled by somebody.

692
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,840
So it's,
there's a lot of group think there's zero,

693
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,040
there's zero descent.

694
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,370
And if you say something derogatory
about the government's appear like the,

695
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,710
and something like Weechat, they
probably monitor it. Jesus, man, fuck.

696
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,310
They Monitor. But of course they monitor.
Of course they do. You didn't text me.

697
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,270
It's an amazing example of how
you can control a lot of people.

698
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,840
But you know in north North Korea you
don't even, there is no Internet, correct?

699
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:53,020
No, no, it's good. They get
no internet, no TV channels.

700
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,490
I talked to a friend of mine works for
the government and his wife works for the

701
00:40:57,491 --> 00:41:01,330
government too and they had
to go to Russia for something
and he said they were,

702
00:41:01,331 --> 00:41:06,160
you were told just absolutely think
you're being followed everywhere you go.

703
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,570
Assumed they're listening to every
word you say. Assume that your,

704
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,550
your hotel rooms bugged. Yup. And then
where you go, you're being followed.

705
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,230
It's all right.
It's kind of like the states.

706
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,260
More evidence we chat is recording private
messages for Beijing to spy on users.

707
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,410
Did you even use the phone? Really be
not real. You text me every now and then.

708
00:41:25,411 --> 00:41:29,770
Tell me how bad is happening already
for a while. Don't we already know that?

709
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,250
They're like, yeah, everything
that's just confirmed like that,

710
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,530
it just freaks people out
as well. It should, but you
know, we're, we're just, we,

711
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:40,190
we forgot how this is.

712
00:41:40,191 --> 00:41:43,880
Why freedom of expression and freedom of
speech in this country is so important

713
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,740
because while this is happening here
in the United States and and freedom of

714
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:53,270
speech is, you know, something that
it, it gets up for debate sometimes.

715
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,160
It's like who gets to decide?

716
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,070
Who gets to say this and gets to
say that and what should we stop?

717
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,900
The problem with any kind
of censorship is right.

718
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,440
While we're here being able
to talk shit on the podcast,

719
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,160
there are a big giant spots of the world
filled with billions of people that

720
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:14,780
can't do this. If they did this,
they would get arrested. Locked up.

721
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,880
That's exactly right.
Deja Vu. China Theater.

722
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:24,410
We did podcasts the way we do podcasts.
No fucking chance. The Arab world,

723
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,410
I mean one of the things that will
come out my legs and in the United Arab

724
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,690
Emirates and Qatar and what,
what,

725
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,320
what's come out is that these
governments are saying these, these, the,

726
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,210
the royal family and the people
that are in power, they go, well,

727
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:36,350
there's political dissent.

728
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,950
So you've got journalists or people
have formed groups at for say,

729
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:43,400
let's say democracy or
elections, and guess what? Uh,

730
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,420
they hire American mercenaries. It was
just a whole article, blackwater dude,

731
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:48,081
guys like that.

732
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:51,500
They find hire American horse needs to
take care of their terrorist problem and

733
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:53,630
they're terrorist problem that they get.

734
00:42:53,631 --> 00:42:58,460
As long as the American company gets
issued weaponry and orders from the

735
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:01,910
standing army, then they can do
whatever they want to use this.

736
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,870
And so this all came, who was the
article I just read? It was fascinating.

737
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:05,704
It was a New York Times,

738
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:10,810
but it was just exposed where there
were these ex Badass special forces guys

739
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,050
making a fortune,

740
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,580
essentially acting as mercenaries in
countries like the United Arab Emirates,

741
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:19,040
et Cetera,
to get rid of their terrorist problem.

742
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,430
Now that's the royal family saying it's
a terrorist problem when it could very

743
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:26,660
well be just a political group, but
they're getting killed. It's terrible. So,

744
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,643
you know,

745
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,660
but the bigger issue in this country is
apparently from what I'm seeing in my

746
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:37,661
own experience is that when you put
a certain ad on Facebook and Facebook

747
00:43:37,821 --> 00:43:41,840
decides to,
that ad might be offensive to someone.

748
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,120
My count just got flagged. Yeah. Uh, okay.

749
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,230
And so even if you say get in the best
shape of your life or whatever it might

750
00:43:48,231 --> 00:43:52,580
be, that might make other people feel
uncomfortable for whatever reason,

751
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:53,510
it's either a Bot,

752
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:58,310
an algorithm or somebody is flagging
that ad or shutting down your account.

753
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,390
And I know a number of people
that that's happened too. Huh?

754
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,790
So what the fuck is going on there?
But, but you know also too is if,

755
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,970
let's say you do an ad or you do
a post on Instagram, let's see,

756
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:09,730
you have 2 million followers on
how many you have. Let's see,

757
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,200
you have 60 million and you do a post,
you know,

758
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:15,650
they limit to how many people that reach
is now you have to pay extra to make

759
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:20,330
sure it reads the Gaa. People Facebook.
Cause that's when those up to,

760
00:44:20,331 --> 00:44:24,020
so I says promote your posts. Like
why I fucking sick. That's why. Yeah.

761
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:30,770
That seems like a business model,
but hold on, but is it here?

762
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:32,190
Yeah,
it's kind of smart.

763
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,210
Yeah. Right person, let's say it's
more, doesn't mean it's not fucked up.

764
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,780
One of those fitness people that grow
their Instagram by just putting ass.

765
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,700
Very not.
There's dudes too.

766
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:45,060
There's guys that I followed that are
just like super jacked and they're doing

767
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:49,260
like one arm chin ups and Shit and you
fall flips. Yeah. Following fitness, dude,

768
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,310
settle down, man. Take
it. He's comfortable.

769
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,640
They're always in a gym where they
can work out shirtless shot, right.

770
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:57,710
Everyone's shirtless,
but they're doing an impressive shit.

771
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,550
There's like a bunch of them
that I follow them. Okay,

772
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,820
but where are you sitting on my point?
You made me nervous having know about

773
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,290
posts, man. They'll reach all these extra
people there. Their thing will grow,

774
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,960
their business will grow.
I'm a man that I'm a fan of that what?

775
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:16,270
I'm not a fan of investment. Why would
I have a question about is is there a,

776
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,470
some buddy in charge of what's,

777
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,490
what's permissible and what's
not according to a certain
code of conduct and do

778
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:25,410
they have a political agenda?
So in other words,

779
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,580
so if I put out something
that has profanity or maybe
I'll stand up clip where I

780
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:30,600
want to get people in,
it's,

781
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:35,550
it's a clip that is offensive to said
person touch possibilities. They can go,

782
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,690
nope. Flag stopping them from
doing that. Well, but see with uh,

783
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,000
with the dudes with their
shirts off flex and shit,

784
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:45,630
when they're trying to get clients,
that's fine. And they can promote,

785
00:45:45,631 --> 00:45:48,570
reach other people outside their
followers isn't what it should be.

786
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,200
But if you have 100,000 followers,
it should reach all hundred thousand.

787
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,440
That's what's crazy to me. Yeah.
They're going to lose everybody.

788
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,970
There's going to be a new Instagram.

789
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:59,700
If they started doing that shit and he
gets out of hand, people just leave.

790
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:00,721
Well there's,
you know,

791
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:05,400
it's shadow banning is right know
there's a concept of shadow banning and I

792
00:46:05,401 --> 00:46:08,520
don't know if this is, Jamie would be
able to speak to this better than me.

793
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:12,360
Is that ever been proved
that they actually do shadow
ban people? What's that?

794
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:17,390
Or is that it's they used is that if you
say we're on Twitter and maybe you were

795
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:25,101
conservative and you said a lot of rude
things about liberals that maybe they

796
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:28,410
would decide that although it
doesn't violate the terms of service,

797
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:30,780
what you do is, uh,
makes them uncomfortable.

798
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:34,500
They make a moral judgment and they
decide to limit your engaged match.

799
00:46:34,501 --> 00:46:38,910
I'm talking about, yeah, this is
somehow possible. Possible. Right.

800
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,340
Or is that like a hater?

801
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,040
It's up in what you're saying
with the paying of, of post to,

802
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:48,750
it happens similarly there too.
If you were at an account that never paid.

803
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,470
Yeah. And once you pay, once
you give him five bucks, you're,

804
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:56,160
you're like flag now as an account
that will pay and changing the game on

805
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:59,840
Twitter. It's Twitter. You don't cross the
board. Yeah. You can pay on Twitter too.

806
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,250
How do you pay on Twitter? Do you
pay on Twitter? You don't have to,

807
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:06,150
but the option you can
pay. Yeah, promoted tweets.

808
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,800
It's a promoted tweet.

809
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:11,160
The top trending topic for the
last year or two is a paid,

810
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,740
it says paid or promoted.
Yeah.

811
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,380
You just have to go into it
because they get money now.

812
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,710
That's how they're banned from
Twitter. A lot of people, man, really

813
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,160
management's been banned from Twitter
and more conservatives, conservatives,

814
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,790
but liberals like Ben to do,
liberals that are put out death threats,

815
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,653
they'd been banned.

816
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,290
But general you get should be lopsided.

817
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:42,220
You don't know. That's a good question.
We should find out what is the,

818
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,980
what is the suffering should be banned?
The backing band.

819
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,150
That's a good question too.
Is it to incite violence?

820
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,690
The violate their terms of service
and definitely if you incite violence,

821
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,700
that's definitely a no, no
racial slurs or no, no racist.

822
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:02,200
Fuckhead you can call someone a fuck head,

823
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:07,120
but you can't call him like a
Guinea fuckhead. Yeah. There's like,

824
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,000
there's certain things you can say
in certain things you can't say,

825
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,650
but it's a lot of, it's subjective. Yeah.

826
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,170
But then some of it's pretty black
and white. Like if you're like, man,

827
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:17,910
I want to go so much a blow
up that fucking school.
Fuck those cards. Of course.

828
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,950
Where the racist stuff.
Yeah. Yes. All of that.

829
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:22,390
I think you got to regulate the hate to,

830
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:26,560
if it's just bullying and shit like
that, just ban them. Wow. It's like,

831
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:32,770
here's the question and this is who gets
to decide who was hateful and what's

832
00:48:32,771 --> 00:48:33,131
not,

833
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:35,830
and then the problem is they keep pushing
it further and further and further and

834
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:40,780
then even just insults or hateful.
Even even like this guy who's a dumb ass.

835
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,200
Yeah, that's hateful. Saying
someone's a dumb ass. It's hateful.

836
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:48,160
I mean they're kind of,
there's only so far you can,

837
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:51,340
you could keep going down that road,
right?

838
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,340
You want to make sure that you have
free expression and you don't get free

839
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:55,174
expression.

840
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,790
If you banned people from saying things
that just don't seem that bad to me.

841
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:04,660
Looks Jones, you think his banning
would like to see what he says.

842
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,170
Sandy Hook stuff it sandy, but see, but
here's the thing. Getting sued for that.

843
00:49:08,171 --> 00:49:10,360
Anyway. Here's the thing. Yeah. He
was already getting sued for that.

844
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,340
Like what did he say that got them?

845
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:16,810
I think something happened that he did
had nothing to do with even what he said.

846
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,370
He confronted them at some event,
right? And he was yelling in the back.

847
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:26,371
And that happened after he confronted
people in Congress and he's got a bus.

848
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,200
Alex Jones has a regular
on a former CIA officer,

849
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,070
Dr Steve [inaudible].
He has them on like once every six months.

850
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:39,250
That's where he got the sandy
hook information was from him.

851
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,910
That dude is on volume as a
CIA guy know about sandy hook.

852
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:46,990
The fuck would he know that's the dumbest
fucking thing that Alex Jones has ever

853
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:50,350
done. It's also a moral
and there's parents, fuck,

854
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:54,990
fuck that guy. Fuck of whatever.
If he said it didn't fuck him too,

855
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,780
you have to always wonder
and you would you, I mean,

856
00:49:58,781 --> 00:50:00,550
I'm not making any accusations,

857
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,830
but you'd have to always wonder
when you hear a story like that,

858
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:05,770
why would someone say
something so ridiculous?

859
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:10,750
And why would someone tried to convince
someone like Alex Jones of something so

860
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:14,920
ridiculous? And I think there'd be
two reasons. One to discredit Jones.

861
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,370
If you could talk him into
repeating what you said,

862
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,440
if you think he's willing to do,
that's interesting.

863
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:24,250
You can easily discredit him and it
would be a really good way to do it.

864
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:27,920
Like the best way to do it. That's what
I'm saying, whether he's right or wrong,

865
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,130
but

866
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,660
whether he's right or wrong
several times on the show.

867
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:37,040
So, but he's started Alex
for Alex to believe him. No,

868
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,720
it's not that crazy.

869
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:41,080
He's hearing it from a guy who
was in the CIA started like this.

870
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,390
It's not that crazy for him to
believe in a guide from, you know,

871
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:48,540
he may or may not be right. But it
started with Alex actually saying, uh, uh,

872
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,400
he said, unfortunately he goes
something to the effect of I saw it,

873
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,830
it was very sad.
And then,

874
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:59,240
but unfortunately I've seen a lot of soap
operas and I've seen a lot of, and, and,

875
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:04,110
and I know an actor when I see one and
that's where it started with him. Yes.

876
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:06,140
And he's being,
he's being sued by,

877
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,800
he bought a farm in Connecticut and
he's in trouble. Be Good acting coach,

878
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,190
but remembering chosen activities.
He was me in court and they said,

879
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:15,470
what the fuck? Basically what the
fuck you're doing? He goes, listen,

880
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:18,200
I say a lot of things just for,
for entertainment of course,

881
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:21,050
like it's just for the during.
Is that his trial with his wife?

882
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,470
But he did admit, he's like, uh,
I don't believe it. A lot of it.

883
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,980
I just say he's got a business.
Yeah.

884
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:31,310
Well that's the thing about all a lot
of nutrition people and he's right.

885
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,600
A lot of these people is you make money.
You make money in this, in this business,

886
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,750
and whether what or whatever it is,
whether it's being a political pundit,

887
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:43,580
whether it's on an exercise guy,
you make money having answers.

888
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:46,670
If you're somebody who's more scientific
and says, I dunno, it depends.

889
00:51:46,671 --> 00:51:50,510
Maybe you're not going to make money.
When you say bone broth cures cancer,

890
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,030
you're going to sell
books. When you say, uh,

891
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:57,680
my plant based Diet is proven to
do blah, blah, blah, whatever,

892
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,680
you're going to make money.
If you say, I'm going to,

893
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,430
I'll help you lose weight and
keep it off in four months,

894
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,340
you're not going to say,
Hey, I'm a nutritionist guy.

895
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,570
It's going to take you two years.

896
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:10,730
We're going to try to change how you're
going to have bounce backs are going to

897
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:13,340
have plateaus and being realistic.
Yeah. Nobody's going to buy that shit.

898
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,350
Just you're Dong guy has all
movement, man. So, but with, uh,

899
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,690
with Alex Jones, so is he banned for life
or business? I don't know. Well, I mean,

900
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,570
he's still has his website. He's got a
big loss to just kind of worry about,

901
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:30,620
but it shows they got rid of his show
helping all the farmers and shit. No,

902
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:33,500
the only thing that had happened is
they pulled him off of youtube and they

903
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:38,501
pulled him off of Twitter and Facebook
to an iTunes and iTunes and he's got a

904
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:42,420
major lawsuit with a walker and that
doesn't compromise. There's tears.

905
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,620
There's two guys, there's two guys
that are being sued over that. Uh,

906
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:50,260
Alex Jones and a guy named a wolf gang.
Helbig great.

907
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,690
He's also, he's also being sued, that guy,

908
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,790
his job was to prepare
schools for school shootings.

909
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,110
So he came out and he started saying
that too. So He's, he's breaking apart.

910
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,560
He started saying that he's getting,

911
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,890
he's getting sued along with
Alex Jones. Oh my God. Well,

912
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,910
but they didn't show up for when you
went to court. They'd never showed up.

913
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:16,830
So they dropped the case.
What about one thing about the La law,

914
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:20,820
it's kind of weird now
that they're the parents.

915
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:25,100
Why would sandy hook be fake? Let's
not talk about this stuff. Oh, I dunno.

916
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,190
I find it fascinating.

917
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,790
Well, why in the world would it be
faked be, I know you get riled up.

918
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:34,470
Like what's the conspiracy theories? Zero
zero thoughts that it, that it's fake.

919
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:37,950
But I do have thoughts on why someone
would try to get other people to say it's

920
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:41,400
fake. And this, if there's any,

921
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,210
does anything that's ever going to
convince you that conspiracy theories are

922
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:46,044
stupid?

923
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,150
It's making up a fake conspiracy easily.
Provable,

924
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:55,030
fake conspiracy about a real tragedy.
That's a nice,

925
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,300
simple psychological
way to discredit people.

926
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,940
If I thought you were a dumb
ass but you had a big voice,

927
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:05,150
I might talk you into saying some shit
about something that's not real and have

928
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:08,100
you convinced it's real. So you spout
it out, you look a moron, right?

929
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:10,290
And that discredits everything
else you said. It's right.

930
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,510
And you have to be really careful
with a lot of these stories.

931
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,320
There's a lot of these,

932
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,680
these conspiracy theories that
literally start out a joke.

933
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:21,510
They start out in four Chan and a lot
of these chat rooms as trolls and then

934
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:22,321
before you know it,

935
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:26,010
it becomes a real thing cause his head
over and as I said over and over again,

936
00:54:26,011 --> 00:54:30,450
and then morons get ahold of. But it's
true though, right? Like he's a smart,

937
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:33,420
we can all agree he's a, I don't agree.
What do you mean is you don't think he's,

938
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,690
I don't know to do what he's doing.
Listen, I don't ever talk about stuff.

939
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,150
No, you would not say he's
a dumb person. I don't know.

940
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,160
I can't speak for you. I take it,
yeah, he's not stupid. It's, I'm very,

941
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,090
very sad that he said that Sandy Hook
isn't real, but I fuck with them.

942
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,160
But I always enjoy being around that guy.

943
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,400
You would say he's articulate smart guy.
Right? I see he's a fun guy to yeah,

944
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,200
so I'm just saying for him to,

945
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:01,040
it's not like you can just honey
dick and back dude. Sandy Hook.

946
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:04,950
Like it would have to be something you
need. Loves conspiracies, man. You know,

947
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,030
he really does.

948
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:10,050
And this is the problem with someone
who likes hunts out conspiracies.

949
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,380
You're going to love them. You're
gonna, you're gonna look for them.

950
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,100
Numerology and the Bible.
You can find any pattern.

951
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,210
This is the problem is when you have
a vested interest in them being real,

952
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,140
when it's your business, because
there are a lot of them that are real.

953
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:29,220
So the problem is if you have a vested
interest in them being real and you

954
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:33,360
exclude information that would point
to them not being real and you use

955
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:37,650
confirmation bias and you fuck up and
then you try to convince other people that

956
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:40,740
you're correct. This is something
that people will fall down.

957
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,580
I'd love to hear you super
quiet about all this,

958
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,820
but if you're a conspiracy theory,
which ones have been proven correct? Oh,

959
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:53,460
that many, right? There's plenty like,
absolutely. There's big ones like Enron,

960
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,100
you know there's big ones.
There's big ones. You know,

961
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,120
there's a many documentaries and books
have been written on the Enron conspiracy.

962
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,780
These guys got together and they figured
out how to make a kajillion dollars and

963
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:05,820
fuck people over. And it was, it was,

964
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,240
it was breaking the law and they
knew it was breaking the law.

965
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:13,020
They can aspire to do it and by mediums
and forums so you can take, take them.

966
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,250
There's wise people to think the 2008
hires, housing crisis, that that was the,

967
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,750
that was all on purpose and these
guys built this bubble up and sank it.

968
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,040
Proven though it's not
proven. It's not proven. The

969
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,270
bubble,
the housing bubble was,

970
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,730
they've been great books written on a
basketball with Michael Lewis's book.

971
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:31,340
The big short is a good book on it.
Good. Yeah. But they, you know, there,

972
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,070
there's been a lot of research on that.
Too many banks. Is there any approval?

973
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,440
One turn all that is all it all
depends. Brennan describes, no,

974
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,690
not at all. No. And he knows his shit.

975
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,100
It all depends on how much
circumstantial evidence, uh,

976
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,380
makes you throw up some red flags.

977
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,070
Like some people they just don't see the
red flags and some people are red flags

978
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:55,810
go up right away. So it all depends. Like
when you say is there any proof? Well, um,

979
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:01,240
you don't need a, I mean at, at us,

980
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,960
at a certain point when you
have circumstantial evidence,

981
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,180
at a certain point it adds up.
You know, you know, if, if, um,

982
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,660
one case pretty suspect
JFK suspect is fuck super,

983
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,550
there's no book, Jeff K's a
perfect example, right? Yeah.

984
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,250
There's no actual proof of the
conspiracy that there was, uh, you know,

985
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:24,070
multiple shooters or the CIA and the mob.

986
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:28,720
There's no actual proof, but there's a
lot of circumstantial evidence as well.

987
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:29,800
So it all depends on,

988
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:34,210
it all depends on how much circumstantial
evidence do you need for any

989
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:37,000
particular conspiracy theory where you go,
Oh shit,

990
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,180
there's enough circumstantial evidence.
Like, if there was a murder, right,

991
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:43,390
and you were being accused and
only one person said, you know,

992
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:46,810
I saw Brendan like four blocks away
from the restaurant where his friend was

993
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:48,910
killed. If just that one person, sorry,

994
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,630
that's one piece of
circumstantial evidence. That's
not enough to convict you.

995
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,010
But if a hundred people said they saw
you two blocks away in the parking lot,

996
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,250
none of it alone, none of it's
standing alone will put you in jail.

997
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,140
But at a certain point, enough
circumstantial evidence,
we'll put dudes in jail.

998
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:08,590
Or if enough people tell the
same story about you with Cosby,

999
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,300
it was the same story over and over.

1000
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:13,630
It's like not all of these women can't
be there all telling the exact same story

1001
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,300
about the same Emma Jackson.
Well, not only that caused me,

1002
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:19,970
had gone to court and had a lawsuit
sealed. Right. And paid a woman off.

1003
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:23,680
That's right. I get it. Already
been done. So that, yeah,

1004
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:27,150
so this was a part of the whole thing
was that he had to come out and uh,

1005
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,970
you know the, the headed defend that in
his most recent trial Bill Clinton too.

1006
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:33,760
I just got done watching those
Monica Lewinsky tapes. Yeah.

1007
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,010
Bill Clinton was a freak.
Oh yeah dude.

1008
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:40,360
The other problem with like being like
Alex Jones who makes a lot of money,

1009
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,320
office conspiracies and things
is that once he said something,

1010
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:47,580
I know a pretty good fan of his Alex.
And um,

1011
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,670
what the problem is once you say something
and you have that big of a following,

1012
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,950
right? So let's just say
you float out of conspiracy,

1013
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:55,600
but then you look at evidence,
you start to realize,

1014
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,420
maybe I overstepped my bounds,
we all say things we wish we had and our,

1015
00:58:58,421 --> 00:58:59,254
we all say things.

1016
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,760
But now you've got a whole movement behind
what you said now to try to pull back

1017
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
would turn that 25% of the whoever it is
against you and that can be a liability

1018
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:09,941
to two.

1019
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:12,580
So one of the things about being a
public figure as you can say something,

1020
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:15,670
and if you're selling product
and sell on your show on that,

1021
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,760
you better be all in. You've
gotta stay all in. Yeah.

1022
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,220
So you become a prisoner to your own
kind of first impulse or own first. Sort

1023
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,850
of like a matter of how it, well, it's,
especially if he's also an entertainer.

1024
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,470
It's also

1025
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:29,960
this rush to say you'd know something
when you don't know it. Yeah.

1026
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,440
There's a rush to say there's a rush to
say we, we absolutely know this happened.

1027
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,760
We absolutely know that happened.

1028
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,230
Attainment. They're getting it
from somewhere. He has his sources.

1029
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,460
She's got information on on
these, on these, you know,

1030
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,400
these tragic events or something like
that. Or you don't think there'll be,

1031
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:50,960
I just looking at me and Brandon,
listen,

1032
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,400
I think he has some people that sell
drones. No, I'm not. Don't take the bait.

1033
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:59,220
And Eddie, he's floating a fucking
huge worm out. Hey, listen,

1034
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,610
come on the show and try not to
talk about conspiracy theories,

1035
01:00:07,611 --> 01:00:10,040
but I always get sucked back into the,

1036
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,080
I always get sucked back to he spoke
that word. No, look, look, he's,

1037
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,970
they're legit question.
I don't know.

1038
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,780
You're asking super crazy legit questions.
You're asking,

1039
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:26,930
you're asking detection. Someone that
someone, you know with one eye opened up,

1040
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,653
kind of like,

1041
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:31,920
okay,

1042
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,230
Hey Brian,
so I'm not bringing up,

1043
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,500
let's talk about tidies

1044
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:44,380
it say no more fam.
I was biting my tongue just like,

1045
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,640
I'm not asking you to go down the crazy,
you know,

1046
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:50,510
and Telsia cause I'm just saying, how do
you get there? You know what I'm saying?

1047
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,290
So he has his black belt in
conspiracy theories. Bryan, you know,

1048
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:58,710
he just never brides in say that there
are no black belts and conspiracy

1049
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:03,420
theories. Alex Jones
says, hold my beer. And

1050
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,410
it was quick. All right, now
the gone where we're waiting.

1051
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:11,580
What is this hot field sign?

1052
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,440
Joe's Camaros, man. Ooh, that's his fight.

1053
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,380
I love this has been gone for a hot
second, right? It was this last one,

1054
01:01:17,381 --> 01:01:21,820
Damien Maia, I believe. Think
so. And that was a bad one, man.

1055
01:01:21,821 --> 01:01:25,810
I did not like the way they pulled him
off of mines back. That made me angry.

1056
01:01:25,811 --> 01:01:29,860
I might have that. He was standing
up and wrapped around the referees,

1057
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:32,470
separated them, and I was
like, what are you doing?

1058
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:36,810
Do you know how hard it is for him to get
to that position and the best grappler

1059
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:40,960
on fucking plan? What are you doing
as a bat? He's a really good spot.

1060
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:45,770
They're both pretty dry. [inaudible]
energy. Yeah, some bullshit bullshit.

1061
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,510
Damien Maia. Well, it's fucked up,
man. It's like that is fighting. Okay.

1062
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:52,900
He's fighting right now.
Just because it's not exciting enough.

1063
01:01:56,550 --> 01:02:00,130
No, they're fighting you. Fuck. This
is what they're doing. The grammy,

1064
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:02,410
me people that freak out
about it like you. You got to.

1065
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:05,320
Just because it's so
exciting when it's good.

1066
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,230
They want it to be exciting all the time,
but it can't be,

1067
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,260
there's going to be fights
where to to fight correctly.

1068
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,030
They have to fight in a way
that's not as entertainment.

1069
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:18,910
It's not as entertaining, but it's the
right way to fight, but you can't sleep.

1070
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:22,200
You can't find the right way.
Exactly.

1071
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:27,240
You can't not fight the right way just
because it's more interesting for people

1072
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:29,900
that don't understand what's,
how you become a 500 fighters.

1073
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,450
You when one punishment we should take.

1074
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,860
It's just not the way to fight. You never
gets the bow ever, ever. Or if you do,

1075
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:41,760
you don't keep it. It's very rare.
Who sponsor a beast? Man. Super tough.

1076
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:46,740
Super strong guy like
wrestling fighting today.

1077
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,270
No, I wish. No, it's fine.
Dos Anjos though. That's a
great fight. It's heavy man.

1078
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,650
That's a heavy fight. Design. Just have
to 70 just became a fucking beef. Yeah,

1079
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:59,160
but he didn't look that good against um,
uh,

1080
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,790
our boy Colby Covington. No,
Colby put on that pressure.

1081
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:05,880
That crazy pills.
Colby beat his ass,

1082
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,840
but now they announced Colby Woodley.
Of course you have to have that.

1083
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,280
That's the fight.
I don't,

1084
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:14,670
Woodley doesn't want to have it because
he's probably angry at the dude. Dude.

1085
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,100
I wish I had done Colby.
Ben Ask him.

1086
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,160
You're going to see angry Tyron
Woodley versus Colby Covington.

1087
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:24,390
That's going to be very
interesting. Angry. I want to
fuck you up. Tyron Woodley.

1088
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,210
What'd they say? Nightmare. Nightmare.

1089
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:30,810
Think about the fucking
guys he's fought recently,

1090
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:32,910
whether it's Darren tail or Thompson.

1091
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,390
Both guys known to be
really high level strikers.

1092
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:41,030
He dropped both those guys didn't hit him.
Oh yeah.

1093
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,920
Damien Maia. Perfect game plans
and tagged him a few times.

1094
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,590
He hit him with some decent shit.

1095
01:03:45,591 --> 01:03:49,740
He's brought but not the right tire
and hit him. Hit Tyron, fucked him up,

1096
01:03:49,741 --> 01:03:53,790
and he drops humped in both fights. And
then Dan until he knocked out. Well,

1097
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:56,660
he got to dumb. He dropped him and then
he choked him. Fucking rocked him. Yeah.

1098
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:00,600
Yeah. He dropped drawn. Any a
member. Yes. Yeah, that's right.

1099
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,940
And he didn't know what was coming.
It was so weird.

1100
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,260
It was like it'd be probably had been
rattled by all those punches and elbows

1101
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:11,730
and shit on the ground too.
And he got dropped by a super clean punch.

1102
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:13,350
Beautiful counter.
Right.

1103
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,170
Do you know there's a fight
for like nine weeks in a row,

1104
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,830
which I'm not mad at at all.
Look at this weird to be TBD.

1105
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:23,470
Tbd Tobacco because the heavyweights,
the tough heavyweight final, Oh,

1106
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,230
I've been watching tough heavyweight.

1107
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:30,090
It's actually a tough
woman's featherweight final.
This is the last tough.

1108
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,000
No,
no.

1109
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:36,630
They're handling strike you back for a
second thing I'd ever think they were

1110
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:39,420
thinking it was the last season.
Right? Well, when you say really well,

1111
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:42,840
Dana said it makes money. J says
it does. No one's watching it.

1112
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,720
I don't know if that's true.
How dare because of those,

1113
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:50,940
it's hard to tell like when someone just
watches something in the moment, right?

1114
01:04:50,941 --> 01:04:54,390
Like when they have ratings, because
almost everybody DVR shit. Now,

1115
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,040
especially when you
talk about cable shows,

1116
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:59,250
it is a fact when they're talking
about the numbers that they get,

1117
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:02,130
that shit is Voodoo. All
right? If you get a number,

1118
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,890
like say if you put up a youtube
video and it gets a million hits,

1119
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,340
that's a million hits. We know for a fact
that's a fact. That's a million heads.

1120
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,110
We don't know how many
people it is because some,

1121
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:11,940
some people will watch
it five or six times.

1122
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:17,500
I still believe that when they're doing
like Nielsen ratings, Shit that's viewed.

1123
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:17,980
Dude,
low

1124
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,500
numbers low. Now they're all
sun. Yeah, no, it's no phones.

1125
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,930
We know that shit is DVR.
Now what they do is,

1126
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,220
cause I know this from my show now
what they do is they will do Nielsen,

1127
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:34,330
but then they will look at like three
days. Do you watch it in three days?

1128
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:37,870
Do you watch it the seven days? You know,
they have all these different metrics.

1129
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,670
The metrics still coming from them having
to fill out forms or is it something

1130
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:46,840
more? It's more technologically based now,
but it's still not a, it's not, you know,

1131
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:50,620
you're still dealing with a number of
those weird definitely doesn't tell you

1132
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:54,160
shit. I find that so strange.
They don't tell you nothing.

1133
01:05:54,161 --> 01:05:57,190
I don't want to give you, the power
will just flip. How fucked up is that?

1134
01:05:57,191 --> 01:06:00,610
Because if let's say 30 million people
watched your special and like, hey man,

1135
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,760
we're just gonna run it back. The same
thing as last year. You're like, what?

1136
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,350
Because you can really look
and go in and renegotiate and,

1137
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,620
but they're very generous. Yeah.
Maybe they're very generous.

1138
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:14,480
I'm telling you. They're very generous.
No, I know they paid you well, but I'm,

1139
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:17,830
hey everybody. Well, when did they
start allowing nudity on Youtube?

1140
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:22,540
Is that new or is there a
rude real you talking about?

1141
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,850
You talking about red? No,
no, no. I'm talking about you.

1142
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:25,940
What the fuck is watching you pour

1143
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,680
hot naked chicks really
about to get a virus.

1144
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:35,260
Youtube on Youtube

1145
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:44,440
telling you, man, you can watch naked
chicks on UTA. It's legal now. Come on.

1146
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:49,120
I don't think so. Addie, where
did you uh, try us the other day?

1147
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:51,670
I'm on Youtube.
I'm like hot naked chicks.

1148
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:55,390
I want her to see how much can you see?

1149
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,580
Are you seeing this is just
testing it out. I'm like,

1150
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:02,230
I wonder if porn is making an onto youtube
and I went hot naked chicks and there

1151
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:06,730
are videos. I'm doing it right now.
Seriously. Isn't that weird that you know,

1152
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:10,630
like we'll make a distinction between top
lizard bottom on. Slick topless. Yeah.

1153
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:15,470
It's kind of racy, but bottom was, oh
God, yeah, you're showing pussy. Yeah.

1154
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,700
What are you doing? Yeah. Is everybody
here going to the Tyson purified?

1155
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,420
I get to work. I'm not. Is
that the one in December? Yes.

1156
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:28,240
It wasn't that Tyson fury. Fucking
wild. Comfort of my own home,

1157
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:33,100
sir. It's like this feed up
freed up, perhaps cocktail.

1158
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,100
This is how I'm going to watch
apps and then if I have to Poop,

1159
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,900
I'm going to pause it.
Why Shit.

1160
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:40,780
And I'm not going to look at my
phone so I'm not gonna have any idea.

1161
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:45,100
Maybe will happen. Let's do it at Joe's
house. Dude, I'm working. I'm in New York.

1162
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,820
Are you? Are you going? You can come
over. I can get you tickets, I'm sure.

1163
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:52,720
All right. Hey listen. Brian
needs tickets. Tickets.

1164
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,790
You really want to go there in
person. Maybe. I don't know.

1165
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,500
It seems like a lot of people I'd rather
look watch. Not a huge TV. I asked.

1166
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,500
That's what I'm saying. You know what I
like? Do you know what Youtube is doing?

1167
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:06,200
That's awesome. Now anytime
you punch in like, um,

1168
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:08,170
like if you punch in moon hoax,

1169
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:11,140
like if you want to watch a conspiracy
theory video on the moon hoax,

1170
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,320
they're going to put a link right on,
right under it boomed.

1171
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:19,310
It takes you to the Wikipedia of, uh, of
the Apollo landings. Like all the, oh,

1172
01:08:19,311 --> 01:08:21,950
that's cool. Yeah. Just,

1173
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,120
they're basically debunking the conspiracy
theory video right there for ya.

1174
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:30,920
I'm watching hot naked chicks on youtube.
Let's see if it happens.

1175
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:36,440
What do you got? Okay.
It's just a photo shoot.

1176
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:40,810
Fast forward a little bit. Yeah.
Dude, look at that. Did you see that?

1177
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:45,320
What's that damn jacking off to you
dude? Right. Look at that. Hello. Whoa.

1178
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:49,790
She's got to run now, but wait, I saw
Ted, you some big ass duties. Hold on.

1179
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:54,040
Come on Bro. Look at that. Oh, the houses,

1180
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,550
they can take their shirts off. Why
can't women, I guess they can, dude.

1181
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:03,520
You won't see 'em you won't
see Genitalia in San Francisco.

1182
01:09:03,521 --> 01:09:05,450
Well, and then he says, just wait at time.

1183
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:09,590
Do you know what the rule is in
San Francisco? What? Look at that.

1184
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:13,250
You guys didn't know this.
No, Bro. Wait a minute.

1185
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:17,650
You can see naked vaginas.
I kicked your Bush out of my face.

1186
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,760
San Francisco.
You can walk around naked,

1187
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:21,950
but you know what the rule is if
you're a man, can't touch me. What?

1188
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,180
What's the what? Yeah. I can't get
hard dude with the breeze kid. Hey Bro.

1189
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:29,120
Tough Schatz attention or something.
You can be naked.

1190
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:32,980
Just don't have a hard on to. Why
is this, this is crazy. Eddie,

1191
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:36,240
how'd you find out about this? I just
thought I just punched it into yourself.

1192
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:39,700
Just go. Hmm. Let me see what
I would just check with you do.

1193
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:44,300
I was just checking it cause he's,
he's a scientist Bro.

1194
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:51,660
Bro. Research row. Now what am I
going to research? That is crazy,

1195
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,260
crazy. No idea. How bout, how bout them?

1196
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,540
The bunker videos on conspiracy.
Like if you put in,

1197
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:00,810
put a punch in moon hoax right now.

1198
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:05,660
A link at the bottom of it right under
the video. But if I titled the Mood,

1199
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:10,180
but if I type in moon landing does
send me some hoax to no, no it doesn't.

1200
01:10:10,181 --> 01:10:14,900
It doesn't do that. No, no, no, no, no.
That would be good. Alistair Overeem.

1201
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:19,660
Oh, you know he changed Kansas elevation
elevation in Denver, Colorado. Christian,

1202
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:23,900
Alan Cody Donovan. And it looks good.
Like the way he looks physically there.

1203
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:28,520
He looks good. He does look good.
A lot of heavy wrestling there.

1204
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:32,240
It's so funny. It's even though he looks
great, like you look at him right now,

1205
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:33,500
you go, damn, he looks great.

1206
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:36,650
The problem with him is you always
judge him against what he looked like.

1207
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:39,890
So he came when he fought Brock,
when he was ubering,

1208
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:44,290
when he was the k one Grand Prix champion.
When the bus dude, when he was ubering,

1209
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:48,870
he was a special thing. Like he was a
special thing. No one wanted to fight him.

1210
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:52,490
No, can't beat that guy. Yes.

1211
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:57,620
Came Pete that Uber Rain. Am I
going crazy right? Cain, Cain,

1212
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:58,160
Pete,
him.

1213
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,760
[inaudible] he never had might a lot of
hard nuts or am I thinking Brock Lesnar,

1214
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:06,500
you seeing a Brock Lez guy beat the
shit out of him. Cain didn't fight Uber.

1215
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:10,200
Him Ever? No, he did it. He beat he
beat Brock. Yeah. And thinking of Brian,

1216
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:14,160
he smashed Bra. Did he ever
fight about a Hari? Yes. Yes.

1217
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:17,430
He knocked Badr Hari out with a left Hook
and Buhari stopped him in the rematch

1218
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:20,040
but high. Yes. But how he
stopped him? Yeah. Badr.

1219
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,700
Hari stopped him in the rematch in the
first fight with butter. Hari. I told him,

1220
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:26,330
I think the story was that bought
her heart was not training very much.

1221
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:28,210
Has He retired? Bought her? No.

1222
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:34,290
You could fall. Rigo Bro. Hoobin and
broke his arm. He's not trying to do,

1223
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:37,470
I'm in May though. Right? Did he go to
jail? He fought one MMA fight, I believe.

1224
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,860
Butter. Hardier management. Why do you
get it? You got to jail a couple times.

1225
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:44,860
Fuck you. Fuck the shit out of people
putting them hands on motherfucker.

1226
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:49,300
Badr Hari. So scary. I
mean, dude. He's like, Nah,

1227
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:53,690
fuck with that guy. He's a
knockout. Hemper yeah, but,

1228
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:56,740
but it pays off in fighting and he's,

1229
01:11:56,741 --> 01:11:59,910
he's got some amazing fights on his
highlight reel, dude. How about,

1230
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,270
how about your first fight in the UFC?
This Russian dude, I'll see the champion,

1231
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:06,420
this Russian organization and they're
like, hey, you got to call the UFC cool.

1232
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:10,680
Who am I fighting? Alistair Overeem,
like, can I ask you a question?

1233
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:13,290
I get those warm up.
How many times has he been knocked out?

1234
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:17,100
153 are shitting really bad every time.
I see it isn't,

1235
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:20,400
it isn't cause he wins and you know,
it's the, it's the, you know, it's,

1236
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:22,860
he's at heavyweight. That
guy used to fight. Well,

1237
01:12:22,861 --> 01:12:26,730
we just accept the fact Polish guy.
Right? Is that Christoph says Zinsky no,

1238
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:30,450
it's John Shara. Okay. Sorry. Oh,
he looks like it's Jeff Munson.

1239
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:35,580
Ciesynski had a, he had fucking
tattoos everywhere. Still
does. It's white as shit.

1240
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,990
He's a white guy. He's Russian Bro. Man.
He's white. White. That blends with snow.

1241
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,900
So like when you're looking at over him,
even though he does look great,

1242
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:46,130
you compare his looking great to
what he looked like when he was Uber.

1243
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:50,070
Did he looks fucking good though. Oh
yeah. A version of Uber Him. Yeah.

1244
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:54,570
But if he like,
well he used to be a fucking nine 11 gts,

1245
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:58,260
three Rs and now he's just a regular
nine 11 there's a good way of putting it

1246
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,600
now. He's like a career
Targa how old is he now?

1247
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:09,010
He's getting up there. He's 38
yeah, he's getting up there guys.

1248
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,820
And he's been fighting forever. Most
skilled heavyweight. Striking. Oh Sue,

1249
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:19,110
still fuck. He's highly skilled.
Highly skilled. K One champ.

1250
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,740
That's what I'm a cowboys. Toronto. He
said that he's like sparring with him.

1251
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:27,120
Is it such a joy because he's
so technical. So good. Oh Shit.

1252
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:31,800
Watch out for that. I mean he's, he's won
more than share. He's lost a bunch too,

1253
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:35,220
but he's one of the best trackers
to ever fight. Never man.

1254
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,880
I'm going with Papa Lovett. You on
this fight. I'm taking my over him.

1255
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,710
He's going to hurt. Yeah, he's gonna.
I, I'm impressed with the strength.

1256
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,650
You think he's hurt?
No.

1257
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,910
I mean he got hit but when
he's hurt you know it,

1258
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,320
it doesn't take much with the
government cause he's been hit so many,

1259
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:54,210
put out so many times he thought, oh
he's full. Still pretty good though.

1260
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,240
You got clipped there.
He just,

1261
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:01,470
he just doesn't take shots as well
as he did when he was ubering to,

1262
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:04,950
because of the size of his neck,
his neck and his traps.

1263
01:14:04,951 --> 01:14:08,910
He used to have like these built in shock
absorbers all run his head. Yeah. Isn't,

1264
01:14:08,930 --> 01:14:12,070
isn't glass Justin Drum reel though,
where your body shuts down.

1265
01:14:12,260 --> 01:14:14,500
It's your brain from so much trauma.

1266
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:19,120
So as soon as nasty trauma that Nope,
we're not doing this anymore.

1267
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,440
It's really not. I
asked, he needed a bone.

1268
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,930
It's your brain at your child's just
got some fucking knees man. Yeah.

1269
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,500
So definitely the best need.
Shadow Dude, skull shore.

1270
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:35,050
That guy that got knocked out. He had,
I dunno, I dunno how he got knocked out,

1271
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,710
but it was on the news that uh,
um,

1272
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:40,930
he had a severe concussion maybe,
you know,

1273
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,700
maybe it was in a coma and he wakes up
and he's super smart. He knows all this.

1274
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:48,550
Like he's a genius man.
My name Brendan,

1275
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,160
just Brian counts to struck by
lightening the Oliver Sacks.

1276
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:56,340
This guy got us a thing, not a
John Travolta movie. The Guy,

1277
01:14:57,340 --> 01:14:58,990
the guy who got struck by lightning,

1278
01:14:58,991 --> 01:15:03,570
who became obsessed with piano and
became a concert pianist, but down,

1279
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:06,760
it's a true story, sac study. But
there's also someone who got fucked,

1280
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,460
either lightning or a w
had a horrible concussion.

1281
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:13,660
Woke up just fluent in Chinese
so she, okay. So it happens.

1282
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,050
Shit happens when it's one of those
things where you hear about it and you go,

1283
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,720
wait a minute, wait a minute. Never
met him though. I mean read this story.

1284
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:21,860
Those stories are bullshit.

1285
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:25,480
I think there's some people
that definitely gets struck
by lightning and then

1286
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:27,520
all of sudden they're good at math.
What if it's true? What if we,

1287
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,200
what if we find out? It turns out
that the more you get knocked out,

1288
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:39,970
the smarter you get. That's what
happened to me. How, how cool training,

1289
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,210
how cool would kickboxing training
people lose?

1290
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:50,590
Just gave it be stupid. But then you'd
get to knock people over on a daily basis,

1291
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,940
ground and pound and thinking that
he's been working with Curtis Blade,

1292
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:56,200
so I'm assuming he's been
working on this a shitload.

1293
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:00,010
What I think is really cool is when
a mathematician works on a crazy math

1294
01:16:00,011 --> 01:16:02,350
problem his whole life,
it has no bears,

1295
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,300
no relevance to the physical
world in a hundred years later,

1296
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:08,530
years later they're using it to put a
rover on Mars or something like it has

1297
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:13,531
relevance a hundred years later
over Raymont top nasty ground.

1298
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:19,560
And pound man just hit me. I'm a
little high. Do you remember when, uh,

1299
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:23,530
do you remember when? Of course we don't.
Did you see that fucking missionary?

1300
01:16:23,531 --> 01:16:26,250
The Christian missionary
went to that island in India.

1301
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,450
It's still a saint and
island and he's like, no,

1302
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:31,360
I'm going to give the word of Jesus.
And Jesus loves you too.

1303
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:34,280
And he and they're like Ha.
And then killed him instant.

1304
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:37,660
I think he got shot through the glass.
I think Ireland. Is that what you said?

1305
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,770
Something like Sentinel Island,
north central island. They,

1306
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:46,000
they left Africa 60,000 years ago and
they would live it on this island.

1307
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,450
And what's interesting is to say,
Guy, I tweeted it on my page,

1308
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:54,630
there's a guy over and finish him off
cause fights or shout out till it's over.

1309
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:56,260
Powerful.

1310
01:16:56,260 --> 01:17:00,100
I always root for over him now to me the
holds on that mother fucker still doing

1311
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:04,390
it, man. 38 doing it, doing it right there
too. One more win. And he's a title shot.

1312
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:08,650
He's always that guy. Dot
over it. Well he's definitely
in the hunt for it. I mean,

1313
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:10,040
look,
when he fought steep a member

1314
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,340
when he hurts deep bay.
Yeah.

1315
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:15,560
It's just as possible that he could have
stopped [inaudible] number and they're

1316
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:19,250
like, Joe, let's bring that up,
you know? Well, maybe not there.

1317
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,620
Well that was when I decided not to
interview people that have been killed or

1318
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:24,210
just like, it's not fair. They don't,

1319
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:28,020
they have a false memory like to get
just got knocked out by steep Amy.

1320
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:31,440
Oh chick dude. I wouldn't mind seeing
him first. France, Francis again.

1321
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:36,020
You crazy son.
I don't want to see that again.

1322
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,210
I don't want to see anybody
get hit like that again.

1323
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,000
If I go through the rest of my days,
what are we talking about?

1324
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,120
Satan guy or the island. Oh, sentinel.

1325
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:48,240
So here's what's crazy.
They used to be,

1326
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:52,850
they used to be sort of uncontacted but
they got contacted in the 18 hundreds by

1327
01:17:52,851 --> 01:17:53,684
this guy.

1328
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:59,470
Now this is a guy a on Twitter posted
this amazing review with all this stuff

1329
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:04,350
is, is his name is respectable law on, um,

1330
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,510
on,
on Twitter.

1331
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:10,510
So he posted this really long detailed
history of what happened to these people.

1332
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:15,110
And a guy name Maurice Vital,
V v Dow Portman.

1333
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,790
And this guy,
uh,

1334
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:21,791
apparently stayed on the island for a
long time and people got sick because of

1335
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:25,490
these people being there. They don't
have any diaries. They have no will,

1336
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:27,510
they have no immunity to,

1337
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:31,610
but he measured their Dick Sizes and
you measured, their boss has his,

1338
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:35,210
he made them pose and all these weird
ways like it's really freaky shit,

1339
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,840
but really, really
interesting. You're like, okay,

1340
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:43,030
he's measuring the children and stuff
like treated them like in Weirdo him offs

1341
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,520
and stuff, but talked about them
like in really weird sexual terms.

1342
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:51,830
And this guy was such a bad
experience for those people that uh,

1343
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:54,650
they're the devil and it was
a bike a hundred years ago.

1344
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:57,740
So when people go back now,
they immediately kill him.

1345
01:18:58,070 --> 01:19:02,300
So because of this one Dick Wad that
landed there a hundred years ago,

1346
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:03,860
they think of white people as evil.

1347
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:08,810
So these two fishermen fell asleep and
I want to say it was like 2006 they fell

1348
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:11,360
asleep and their boat drifted
onto the island. They woke up,

1349
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:14,600
they just fucking Hatcher dumb.
And to them and killed him on the beach.

1350
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:17,840
They live, they don't fuck around
anymore. Think about this one asshole.

1351
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:18,703
If you think about it,

1352
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,390
it's really smart in a fuck
that way because if they get in,

1353
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,560
come into contact one of us,
the entire,

1354
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,450
their entire population could be wiped
out because they don't have immunity.

1355
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:31,460
They're saintliness, right? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no. Right. You sure?

1356
01:19:32,870 --> 01:19:37,310
No, no, no, no, no, no. David
confirmed them. I heard this
from good morning. I'm no, no,

1357
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:41,190
no, no, not good morning America
set the North Sentinel island dude.

1358
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,960
I'm pretty sure the last full
saintliness island. Here's the deal,

1359
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:49,430
Brendan St on even Satan, Satan
is a western concept. He just,

1360
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:51,290
they have no idea.
They just hate white people.

1361
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:55,210
Oh well is there what they don't
like foreign people who's gene?

1362
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:58,040
I Dunno by an actor it has name of,

1363
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,220
they just didn't say white people cause
that one dude came to fuck everything up

1364
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,420
and then you see a white person kill him
data. We don't even know their language.

1365
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:07,620
So to say they're satanists is crazy.

1366
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:11,010
It's like saying that you understand
what they're saying. That's the room.

1367
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:15,960
How big is, how big is that island? A
translator was in Manhattan. Really?

1368
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,100
Now they don't have a translator. Eddie,
they don't even any contact at all.

1369
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,100
The outside world. It's illegal. Oh,

1370
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:26,250
that guy got killed and he paid
illegally to go with it. What are they?

1371
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:28,500
To leave her and go to?
The fishermen got arrested.

1372
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:33,160
So there was a cargo ship that ran
a ground there many years ago here.

1373
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:36,270
There was in 1981. Uh, and uh,

1374
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:41,300
the crew radioed for assistance and then
they got 50 men with bows and arrows

1375
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:45,240
were showing up to, to try to get to the
boat and they helicoptered them away.

1376
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:49,640
The boat is still there.
So this is a crazy ass placement.

1377
01:20:49,641 --> 01:20:53,760
Sounds like an awesome movie. So I know.
And then from that, from that boat,

1378
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:57,480
they started getting metal tools because
they didn't have metal before that.

1379
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:01,480
So until the 19, was it 1980 81? Yeah.

1380
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,610
So now these,
these people took pieces of metal and,

1381
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,550
and cold forged them
into weapons and shit,

1382
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:13,020
like pounded them down with rocks and,
and created knives and stuff.

1383
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:14,310
But these people,

1384
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,920
they're essentially living the same
way people lived 60,000 years ago.

1385
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,650
They've been on this isolated
island ever since then.

1386
01:21:22,810 --> 01:21:26,100
It's of maybe we should just fly over
and drop a ton of iPhones everywhere.

1387
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:30,360
There's the problem. They don't know
how many of them, there aren't any more,

1388
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:33,120
but they know their populations
are declining. So at once,

1389
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:38,070
at one point in time there was a 150 plus
documented and now they think it might

1390
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:41,580
be as low as 39 cause disease and stuff.
They don't have any,

1391
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:44,820
just fucking probably board of
Methodist. Stop fucking, you know,

1392
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:47,790
trying to get fish.
You don't have time to raise the kid.

1393
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:49,470
Which one are you talking
about? This? Emily's, yeah,

1394
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:54,250
there their population that
he left drastically dropping.
There's no a generic,

1395
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:59,100
there's no genetic diversity there.
It's like, I'm sure, yeah, 3,900 folks,

1396
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:04,140
39 folks is a small number. If
they're really down to that few. And,

1397
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:07,350
uh, you know, they're real,
real aggressive when anybody
comes anywhere near them.

1398
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:10,890
But the thing is, now that
we all know about it be, I'm
a part of the problem too,

1399
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:13,290
right? We were all talking about
this. Now that we all know about it,

1400
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:15,510
more people are going to think
about going there. Thank you.

1401
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:17,970
A hundred bucks a year of that. And I
say, fuck leaving the United States,

1402
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:22,170
hundred percent where is that place?
It's somewhere off of India.

1403
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,100
They have bingo. They have been
gone. So it doesn't seem that remote.

1404
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:30,180
If it's an Ebay, it's pretty far. It's
far away. It's hard to it literally.

1405
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:33,330
It's illegal. It's like in the middle
of the ocean wrinkle. So homeboy,

1406
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:36,690
he was doing God's work. It was
like, no, I can do it. And even Ryan,

1407
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:40,920
his journals like, man, I hope I don't die
if I do. My parents don't be mad at me.

1408
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:44,820
I'm headed this island.
Yeah. What the fuck were you
thinking, man? Well, he's crazy.

1409
01:22:44,821 --> 01:22:48,660
He's trying to convert people. He thinks
people need Jesus the same language.

1410
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,890
They don't have any idea what he's saying.

1411
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,910
He's from oral Roberts heart graduated
from Oral Roberts University, right? Yeah.

1412
01:22:53,911 --> 01:22:56,760
See there. That's where
it is. C as well. Shit.

1413
01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,620
Way Out there and a half stars out of fun.
So let's go in there.

1414
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,740
If I go with it,
3000

1415
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:11,560
and that's given it all this
reviews, you get defeated. Go ahead.

1416
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:15,580
Then you'll go ahead and then there's a
suite four seasons. They have great food.

1417
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,950
It's called human that's going
to eat you bitch. Oh, so they,

1418
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:25,000
they killed the guy and then they
buried him right on the beach. Man.

1419
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:29,380
They just dragged his body out to the
beach and the Sherman Indian government

1420
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:31,800
said, we're not going to do anything
about it. And it was a shit there.

1421
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,590
That's all they know. Well,
yeah. I mean, first of all, they,

1422
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,610
their law is you can't visit their island.
That's their law.

1423
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:44,290
So he was violating their law,
him showing up with a this book.

1424
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:49,480
I would imagine they'd, they
have laws against people
visiting, especially whites.

1425
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:50,680
Yeah, man. That,

1426
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:54,100
that story that they tell about that
one English guy that went there,

1427
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:56,860
that was a piece of shit
fucked up for everybody.

1428
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,560
I hope that guy respectable
law on Twitter, uh,

1429
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:04,930
understands how much I appreciate
that. So that was cool. Yeah.

1430
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,650
So they're all songs.

1431
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,260
The just I need to read more navy seals.
Oh yeah.

1432
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:16,720
Take them all out. Automatic. It would

1433
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:23,380
be a cool video.
You never know.

1434
01:24:23,830 --> 01:24:28,310
They might have some crazy booby traps.
They might have some Vietcong Shit for

1435
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,610
beautiful vacation toe,
but it's Starbucks.

1436
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,560
Look at the person with the locals.
When here was my girlfriend for a holiday,

1437
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,250
I loved it. She wasn't impressed. Very
poor choice for a romantic getaway.

1438
01:24:42,370 --> 01:24:44,740
Great choice for anyone
looking to rough it up a bit.

1439
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:51,970
So silly. People are so funny. Well,

1440
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:56,200
that island though is um, there's
gotta be people going, fuck no.

1441
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,610
Under the coming century.

1442
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:04,120
Dan Bilzerian is going to be there
next month with a bikini on the house.

1443
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:08,980
It's going to just send a boatload of vape
pens. It was that I was taking a piss.

1444
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:10,960
India, India, India.

1445
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:15,130
They came from Africa
though 60,000 years ago.

1446
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,310
It's like draws closer to Thailand.

1447
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:22,100
Pretty amazing. Just kind
of, they know that how, how,

1448
01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:25,240
how would they figure that out if you're
not allowed to go on the island that

1449
01:25:25,241 --> 01:25:30,130
they'd been around 60,000 years ago? It's
a good question. I don't know. Well, it's,

1450
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:34,590
I can pop on a Guinea. Those tribes have
been isolated for, for 40,000 years. Yeah,

1451
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:38,830
still. Yeah. Not Anymore. But I mean,
when Jared diamond went and studied them,

1452
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:42,130
they'd been isolated for that long.
They practice weird things too,

1453
01:25:42,131 --> 01:25:44,380
like widow strangling and
all kinds of screening widow,

1454
01:25:44,381 --> 01:25:46,960
stranger and that one
tribe where you were,

1455
01:25:46,961 --> 01:25:51,961
the young boys suck the Cox of the older
men and take it in their ass as well to

1456
01:25:52,601 --> 01:25:54,580
become men.
So they in the sperm,

1457
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:57,860
it's not just some weird started that.

1458
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:03,010
If you don't have somebody that can,
can compete with those ideas,

1459
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:06,070
then that gets passed down as religion.
I've got to Piss.

1460
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:10,880
So tell me who wins what. I Never
Seen Him take a pee break. No. Yeah,

1461
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,950
the first, first time. Love. There
you go. That's right. We can pause.

1462
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:15,540
Go on with your little lilac.
Sure.

1463
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,170
Frances and got on boys.
I'm excited about this fight,

1464
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:26,280
which Jack does always. Yeah,
it's a big fight for a minute.

1465
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:27,980
Cause remember he beat him last time,

1466
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:31,520
but he's coming off that steep a ass
whooping and then had the horrible fight

1467
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:34,370
against Derek Lewis, which is like the
worst heavyweight fight of all time.

1468
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:35,540
No one won that fight.

1469
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,580
Obviously Derek won that fight because
the judges and then Derek goes on to

1470
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:45,190
fight for it. Since then, this is his
first fight since Derek Lewis. Oh Shit.

1471
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:49,910
I don't like it because obviously he
struggles with wrassling so like go,

1472
01:26:49,911 --> 01:26:53,120
here's Curtis plays the best wrestler
in the top five. I just don't like it.

1473
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,790
I would show the game someone
else who matched up better,

1474
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,630
no matter if he wins or loses. I just
don't think it was a great idea. Um,

1475
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:04,660
is he from Chad? Where's he
from? Ghana. Chad the Congo.

1476
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:08,870
Congo. You shoot man. I
thought he was from more west.

1477
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:14,020
I think it's the Congo. Jamie. Yeah.

1478
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:16,843
Yeah.

1479
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:20,060
Curtis placements in Ghana. That's
a French name. So it makes sense.

1480
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:24,180
He's from the Congo. I'm pretty sure it
was tango policies sees Ghana, Cameroon.

1481
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,020
Is that where he's from?
Yeah.

1482
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,503
Okay.

1483
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:34,560
Well Cameron's one of the last places
where there's like sort of continuous

1484
01:27:34,911 --> 01:27:39,900
habitat for different animals. Oh,
he's coming out to mortal Kombat but up

1485
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,520
woo,
great tune.

1486
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:48,290
Now they're fighting at three
30 in the morning our time.

1487
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,280
So it's a bit of a time Chad Shit time.

1488
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:55,280
Curtis blades just always fights on
foreign land. When did they get there?

1489
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,820
How many days do you need to adjust that?
They had thanksgiving over there,

1490
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:01,310
so I'm assuming they get,
well I imagine he gets,

1491
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:04,100
he flies in on Tuesday like any
other fight week. Right. Do what?

1492
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,460
I would want to come early. It's hard
to get used to sleeping over there.

1493
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:11,030
I can't imagine. Yeah, it,
I was in Thailand in here.

1494
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:15,800
Can't you just try to take naps and you
can but the sunset and all that fucks

1495
01:28:15,801 --> 01:28:18,440
you up.
The best way I say it,

1496
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:21,530
they say it's just fast for
like 16 hours and then eat.

1497
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:23,850
I like when you get there in the morning,
eat,

1498
01:28:23,851 --> 01:28:27,200
have breakfast and just get on the same,
your body gets used to the eating cycle.

1499
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:30,170
Fastings were they important? Apparently
for. Okay. That's what you did over there.

1500
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:31,220
I be,
I tried.

1501
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,970
I tried to work now and you're still
tired but you still thinking of moving to

1502
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:38,870
China? I am going to go to Beijing
and living in an apartment.

1503
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:42,620
Are you going to be a political dissident?
I'm mean,

1504
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:47,621
I'm marching and [inaudible] Australia
as a time change fucked me up.

1505
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:51,890
I was exhausted and he came back up.
I go in there, I was fine coming back.

1506
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:56,130
I was so fucked up in that weird that
it's going back somehow or another dose

1507
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:57,420
two or uh,

1508
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:02,220
you know what I need to try taking
Melatonin like one I land like when I,

1509
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:06,730
when I need to go to bed that night.
Yeah, I don't think so. I try to help,

1510
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:10,590
you know what helps me? CBD Oil. Yeah. It
helps me relax. I take it in the morning,

1511
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:13,480
but especially at night, at
night, it helps me without,

1512
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:18,000
without the thing that seems to be about
reset my system better than anything is

1513
01:29:18,001 --> 01:29:20,570
a serious fucking workout look like,

1514
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:24,960
show up somewhere and do a serious
workout, like to push a cardio,

1515
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,130
lift some weights,

1516
01:29:26,370 --> 01:29:31,140
like really get tired and that
seems to set me, set me up,

1517
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:33,110
did that and I've kind of
stopped because I was so funny.

1518
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,540
I said that I started when I was
in Afghanistan while we worked out,

1519
01:29:36,541 --> 01:29:39,270
me and Deb David, I've worked out
like a motherfucker and I did.

1520
01:29:39,271 --> 01:29:42,390
It helped me a lot. I felt way
better. It puts your cycle, Babs,

1521
01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:45,630
you're afraid the whole time. Usually on
the road, wherever I land I worked out.

1522
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,310
Yeah. When I land I'll work out
and I feel better. That's the moon.

1523
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,710
But there's a new scientific study range.
Crisper, like everything's better. Yeah.

1524
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,450
This, this scientific study. I'll
find it at the end of my phone. Yeah,

1525
01:29:55,451 --> 01:29:56,400
please get where we're at.

1526
01:29:56,450 --> 01:30:01,450
We're fasting for 16 hours is the most
important thing you can do and then reset

1527
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:03,140
time changed.

1528
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,470
I usually sending your clock with
however they were eating there because

1529
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:11,160
[inaudible] 91 yeah, I've heard that
you should not eat on planes too.

1530
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:15,630
I've heard that you're better off just
not eating on planes on the ground plane.

1531
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,490
When you get,
when you land like your,

1532
01:30:17,491 --> 01:30:21,450
your body will be better off falling
into this new time zone when you land.

1533
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:24,780
If you just don't need on that you
don't even know I'm playing to ever.

1534
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,120
I meditate on his position,
dude.

1535
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:30,960
When they come by with that card and they
get that snack tray. Yeah. Nice cheeses,

1536
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,710
fruits and shit. Pringles. Sometimes
I just want a banana. I me too.

1537
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:39,630
Sometimes I just want to Swedish
fish. Ah, I talked to Pat. His fish.

1538
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,790
Yeah. And Pringles smoke macro. The
sweetest fish and the little crack. No,

1539
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:49,240
no sweets Fisher though. That candies
you don't, you do sometimes if I,

1540
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,060
if I'm feeling Frisky,
damn.

1541
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:55,660
I feel like I've earned it if I'm coming
back from a long fricking couple of

1542
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:56,071
nights.
So the thing,

1543
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:59,160
I never feel like I earned those
every time he thought it was.

1544
01:30:59,161 --> 01:31:01,440
I feel like a bad boy
and I don't feel great.

1545
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,300
After I flew first class to London and
they got food and I was eating cheeses

1546
01:31:06,301 --> 01:31:08,520
and wines to get hammered.
No,

1547
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:11,040
but I just kept drinking and
eating and I just felt like,

1548
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:16,440
fuck you shit on the plane.
Um, no, I don't think so.

1549
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:21,720
You felt terrible when you landed.
I was just one big sodium Bob. Yes.

1550
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:24,980
I'll have more chase. Do you have a
wheel back there? Sure. And I'll leave.

1551
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:29,550
I know another ice cream Sundae. I just
went a little crazy and wine. Yeah,

1552
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:34,170
that's what that fucks me. I find
the do good writing on planes though.

1553
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:38,880
You get some good ideas out because
it's just you alone staring at this,

1554
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:41,940
you're not moving right. You're,
you're confined to this little seat.

1555
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:46,200
You're not going anywhere. Sometimes good
ideas come when you just sit like that.

1556
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,580
It's so easy to just fuck off. When
you're at home. I know you're writing,

1557
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:51,870
you just,
it's so easy to just get,

1558
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:55,290
let me see what's in the fridge and me
go grab a cup of coffee. I set a timer,

1559
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,830
23 minutes. I don't know why but
23 minutes and then I can't move.

1560
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:02,500
Kayla's good man. I
think I just, you know,

1561
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,530
I just forced myself to do it.
The thing is,

1562
01:32:05,531 --> 01:32:10,480
what's weird about it is for whatever
reason I resist doing it at first like,

1563
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:14,220
ah, but then once I get into it and
I catch a groove, I love it. Yeah.

1564
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,820
It's like getting into a cold bath.

1565
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:20,360
Like at first your skin's like mark
and then you're like, Oh yeah, I uh,

1566
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,700
I think everything is that way.

1567
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:26,410
I think inspiring yourself to kind of
get started and then kind of figure out a

1568
01:32:26,411 --> 01:32:27,990
way to keep it even working out though.

1569
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,090
I did did my class this
morning in that box,

1570
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,370
morning cardio class and when we start
I'm like, God, it, why did I come?

1571
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:36,940
And then halfway through I'm like, this
is great. Yeah. Well you know what man,

1572
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:40,540
I fucked myself up. But that a sober
October fitness challenge thing,

1573
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:44,110
that's a bad idea and this is what
fucks you up. Like afterwards,

1574
01:32:44,111 --> 01:32:45,910
you look regular working out.

1575
01:32:45,950 --> 01:32:50,410
It seems boring because
everything was this cycle hours,

1576
01:32:50,411 --> 01:32:52,940
five hours a day.
We're competing against each other.

1577
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:57,850
You'd get anxiety like check the APP,
see where everybody's scores. That shit.

1578
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:02,060
Fuck. You know you need, you can do that.

1579
01:33:02,061 --> 01:33:06,640
You still beating against Bert
Kreischer, Arusha, fear and Tom Segura.

1580
01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:11,530
So let's take it easy. No, I'm
not saying I'm still, you still.

1581
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:14,470
You know what I mean? Like
my competition, those guys,

1582
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:21,790
he's going to coast. The
last guy. Competitiveness.

1583
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,130
I'm telling you, man brushed him. Joe.

1584
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:27,580
Joe was like Glass Cham Haynes in that
motherfuckers would have no chance.

1585
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:31,650
Kim Haines and me and that bitch.
We should do a real fitness dude.

1586
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,940
I'm telling you, even if
you're doing it, the thing is,

1587
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:38,530
it's about how much time you spend.
It's about how hard you worked down.

1588
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,060
See, it's like how much time are you
spending at 80% of your Max heart rate?

1589
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:46,990
That's really what it's been. That's
watch how fast and Gannaway is Jesus. Oh,

1590
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,070
he's terrifying. We should probably wash.
He's laying on his feet too, right? Yeah.

1591
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:55,600
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God,

1592
01:33:55,710 --> 01:34:00,490
he just so powerful. Oh
my God. Ooh. Oh, oh, oh,

1593
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:04,940
oh, oh, oh, that's it.
That's it. That's it. Dan.

1594
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:10,420
He's back. Oh my God.
Starched him. Wow. You can't,

1595
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:15,070
that was crazy. Tad of an early
stoppage, but I don't know.

1596
01:34:15,071 --> 01:34:19,020
It looked like it was almost an early
stopped working his way back up. No,

1597
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:20,350
I don't think it was around.
I stop thinking.

1598
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,710
I was going to say it looked like it was
almost early stoppage and then they let

1599
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:27,200
it go on and then it was a
decent stop. Yeah, I agree.

1600
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:28,830
Because that's how you save a fighter.
It seem like that's,

1601
01:34:28,831 --> 01:34:31,690
how are you getting that? They were
going to stop it. Yeah. He got,

1602
01:34:31,691 --> 01:34:32,980
he got concussed right away.

1603
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:37,080
He got percent three chances Curtis
place 26 years old. Give him,

1604
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:40,300
he's got a lot of fight left in them,
so just that's a good stop. It's fine.

1605
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:44,020
He's just got caught. Literally
just got cut. Good stops. The only,

1606
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:47,770
I think it was the only way
he's gonna lose this fight.
It's getting cut. Yup. God.

1607
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:51,010
That's what happened.
Got to look fast. Listen.

1608
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,340
That's the levels of standup between them.
You know what I mean?

1609
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:57,660
Curtis blades is a good stand up fighter,
but a really good wrestler.

1610
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:01,410
His wrestling stats, so like the, some of
the best in the heavyweight division. He,

1611
01:35:01,430 --> 01:35:05,690
Beth, as far as a successful taping on
the back of the head with that hammer.

1612
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:10,430
God, boom. See like right there. It
looked like the ref was about to stop it.

1613
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:16,160
Boom. Wow. So much power runs over
there and look, he touches them.

1614
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:18,440
He touched him.
You're not supposed to touch him.

1615
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:23,360
He prayed to his friend and knew
my name. Yeah. I don't know man.

1616
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:27,740
I thought he was going to stop, boom. And
that then he decided to it. That's it.

1617
01:35:27,741 --> 01:35:31,460
That's it. That's it. That's a
dangerous job, man. Supersede that.

1618
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:34,010
A clip from the Moitai, one of the, uh,

1619
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:39,030
Moy Tai websites has it up there of
this referee is stepping in to stop this

1620
01:35:39,621 --> 01:35:42,890
fight and then it's a head
case. I saw it. He gets it.

1621
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:44,750
Takes a shin right to the dome,

1622
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:48,600
gets knocked the fuck out while he stayed
conscious, but he went down. Let me see.

1623
01:35:48,601 --> 01:35:53,430
It's moving, but he get head
kicked. That's a dangerous man.

1624
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:55,720
And the first thing you imagine
me and Curtis page right now,

1625
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,930
you took the plane for 20 hours to fly
over to get knocked down. 45 seconds.

1626
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:03,180
They'll worst. Yeah. The longest
possibility within Ghana.

1627
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:09,110
God damn good frigging in
Ghana and get back on track.

1628
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:13,310
I wasn't crazy about the fight for him.
Yeah. What did he say about that fight?

1629
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:16,220
Officially? Which one? Where
he didn't throw any punches.

1630
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:19,790
He said the carried the fear of
his last fight is confidence.

1631
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:25,280
And then Dennis was hurt. So
you get a shit show, you know,

1632
01:36:25,390 --> 01:36:27,980
it's neither one of those fault
Dick was hurt with his back.

1633
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:30,830
Francis had no confidence.
It was crazy.

1634
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,930
I mean it was the squeakiest of squeaky
margins for Derek to win because nothing

1635
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:39,710
really happened in the fight they had.
No one really won.

1636
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:43,700
It was just while we were talking about
that fight. We were like, Ho Lee Shit.

1637
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:46,500
This is going to be bombs away.
That's why I think yes,

1638
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:48,650
people say it's the worst heavyweight
fight cause you just thought it was going

1639
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:52,670
be fucking fireworks. I think I
might've even said in the commentary,

1640
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:55,730
there's not a doubt in my mind
that this is going to be crazy.

1641
01:36:56,180 --> 01:37:00,350
But who wouldn't think that? That's fair
to think with their two fighting styles.

1642
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:03,440
I didn't know thought it was going
to be chaos. I thought awesome.

1643
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:06,620
Derek is going to be throwing
haymakers trying to find his chin.

1644
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,100
I'd like to see him go at it again.

1645
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:12,890
That I would love to see that as Floyd
really fighting that one kickbox yes.

1646
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:16,350
Yeah. You Know David agreed to.
It's real but it's going to be a,

1647
01:37:16,351 --> 01:37:19,670
an exhibition boxing match.
Fake kind. It's a boxing match.

1648
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:24,920
They're probably going to wear big
gloves. No kicks, no checks. No.

1649
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:28,370
Unless it's too smart for that.
Unless the fucking,

1650
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,590
the Japanese just say Oh okay. So we
agree. Kick it too. Unless, unless,

1651
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,710
unless the accuser goes
up to that kid and go,

1652
01:37:36,711 --> 01:37:38,990
hey here fucking head kick him Kale.

1653
01:37:38,991 --> 01:37:41,650
We're going to give you a $2 million
in the middle of the first round.

1654
01:37:42,360 --> 01:37:47,010
Kind of cool to see. But they'll rush
you through some contract negotiations.

1655
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,810
Okay. He would go. It was
weird cause Floyd was like,

1656
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:53,390
that was all bullshit and we agreed to
any of this. Then a week later he's like,

1657
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,160
actually we're going to do it.
Listen the Japanese or they

1658
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,680
do a different kind of business.
They're very clever over there.

1659
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:03,420
You know the UFC got kind of the got
kind of like when you look at the,

1660
01:38:03,421 --> 01:38:07,730
the sale of pride, you know, like
what happened with all that? They,

1661
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,230
they did a smart thing,
a really smart thing.

1662
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:13,020
One thing that came over and they
pretended they were going to have pride

1663
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:16,350
fighters fight in the UFC and
UFC fighters. Frightened pride.

1664
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:19,660
Remember that in the early days,
like the EOC that shuffle the child,

1665
01:38:19,690 --> 01:38:22,680
the Dell over there and they were going
to bring fighters over to America.

1666
01:38:22,681 --> 01:38:26,070
He never did. Yeah. No, they never did.
I had to wait until they bought it.

1667
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,570
And then when they bought it, they
basically just bought a DVD library. Yep.

1668
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:33,660
And they spend like $60 million for pride.
And when they got it,

1669
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:34,560
they couldn't even run it.

1670
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:37,820
So then they had these people that were
running the office and these people were

1671
01:38:37,821 --> 01:38:41,010
in the office. They just went off and
made dream. They made their own shit.

1672
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:44,520
And so they were like sold basically a
logo and a brand and these contracts,

1673
01:38:44,521 --> 01:38:45,990
the contracts weren't even any good.

1674
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:50,340
Like they didn't like a lot of the
fighters were not bound to them, you know,

1675
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,580
like fate or like they didn't
have fade or they did this,

1676
01:38:52,770 --> 01:38:55,470
they didn't have a lot of things and
they owed a lot of guys money and they

1677
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:57,700
thought they were going to
operate in Japan. Like what?

1678
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:02,540
We're going to run pride too is what like
right, that shit. No chance male way.

1679
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,630
But what they did with those smart is the,

1680
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:09,900
the first thing pride did was they pumped
up their own value by bringing their

1681
01:39:09,901 --> 01:39:13,140
fighters over here and pretending they're
fighters going to fight you. Chocolate.

1682
01:39:13,141 --> 01:39:16,900
Dell, remember they had that crazy
stare down way back in the day, but,

1683
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:21,170
but then they never did. We, everybody's
always talking about nothing happened.

1684
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,600
But after that, what they did not
want pride mentioned on the air. No,

1685
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:30,480
they hate him.
Dre want them their name men.

1686
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:32,940
How is Bella towards to
say they fought in Japan.

1687
01:39:33,310 --> 01:39:37,860
The USC also honey dicked the WME, when
they sold their thing, like, look dude,

1688
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:41,310
we got Rhonda, we got
Brock, we got Connor,

1689
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:43,440
we're doing all this big shit man.

1690
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:47,160
And then they sold it for $4 billion
and like I run is going to retire,

1691
01:39:47,161 --> 01:39:50,340
so we can't do nothing about that Bronx
over in WWII. So we'll figure that out.

1692
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:54,680
Well the Rhonda and then college for
two years of purchase, they, that was,

1693
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:58,230
they had already purchased it.
That was the last Ronda fight.

1694
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:00,210
The Comeback Fire they
had already purchased.

1695
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,350
That's also probably why it was marketed
the way it was marketed. Correct.

1696
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,660
Because all eggs in a,

1697
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:10,010
that was one of the rare times where
I publicly was like, this is not,

1698
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:13,830
here's aren't doing the right thing
because the Amanda Nunez, the champion,

1699
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:17,340
she's a world champion. She stopped
me. Should teach you, strangled her.

1700
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,790
Like you gotta give her respect.
She still not as respect as she should be,

1701
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:23,800
but that was, that was a crazy one.
That was the worst one I've ever shows.

1702
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:24,521
All Rhonda,

1703
01:40:24,521 --> 01:40:27,930
nothing of a manager and a couple seconds
just like Amanda doing something real

1704
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:30,150
quick and that's it.
Like there should like hitting the bag,

1705
01:40:30,151 --> 01:40:35,151
but the rest was first ever women's MMA
champion that that's a lesbian first

1706
01:40:35,341 --> 01:40:38,910
ever. UFC with her girlfriend. The corner.
Yeah. Who's also a courtesy champion.

1707
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,460
So first ever gay UFC champion.
Right.

1708
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:46,830
And no one talks we know of that we
know of. Right. I think that's it.

1709
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:50,070
I think it was point we haven't that
women's and made that long for champions.

1710
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:54,120
Well, you're saying you're
saying guy or Gal? Girl. I'm

1711
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,970
just trying to be funny.

1712
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:00,520
I started thinking about what gave
champion. I was like, who could be gay?

1713
01:41:00,660 --> 01:41:03,670
But Amanda Versus Cyborgists
Hoop or interesting.

1714
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:08,830
Super interesting to me because
uh, you know, sideboards,

1715
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,860
she's way bigger.
She's bigger.

1716
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:15,430
How about Amanda or Cal Pennington and
both their girlfriends fight in the UFC

1717
01:41:15,431 --> 01:41:20,190
two and then in their corners.
Crazy. That's insane. Insane
in a bad way, but cool.

1718
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:23,620
Yeah. I mean we've come a long
ways. Yeah. It's different.

1719
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:28,990
It's fascinating to watch
her bag. Yeah. JDS fighting.

1720
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:34,530
Um, they both been out a fucking
grip. Keynes coming back here.

1721
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:37,270
That, is that real? Yeah, Dude.

1722
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,170
I'm 19 but when did they have a date?
No,

1723
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,890
just announce he's back
in DC. Posted. Hey,

1724
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:46,930
he said the belts waiting for
the champ. Whoa, he's back.

1725
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:50,110
So what do you guys think
of Amanda Against Cyborg?

1726
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:55,210
I think Amanda's got to move. I
think a only she have a chance. Sure.

1727
01:41:55,211 --> 01:41:58,780
She's got a chance. She's a beast,
but, oh shit. That's a great fight.

1728
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:02,300
Tied to a Vasa Janie. That's right.
The mother fucking fight. You right.

1729
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:05,380
Favorite could probably be Cyborg.
I don't, there's no, there's no,

1730
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:10,810
there's no girls. But she's
like Joana, man, it's not
happening. She's got a chance.

1731
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:15,600
Amanda Nunez is probably my favorite
female fighter too. I really wouldn't.

1732
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,820
She walked around that.
What do you think, Amanda?

1733
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:20,530
She's probably in the one
sixties if I had to guess.

1734
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:23,620
And what do you think cyborg walks
around that we went through this right?

1735
01:42:23,621 --> 01:42:27,430
She said she's down there. You know,

1736
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:32,890
she got mad. She was bigger. She, she's
such an animal. She is so much bigger.

1737
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,250
That's going to be a crazy fight,
man.

1738
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,150
That's on the same card as a
Gus van Jones too too. Yeah.

1739
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:45,070
Yeah. Gus, it's been a hot minute.
She can't wait for that fight.

1740
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:48,450
Yeah, I know. Right. I think the key to,

1741
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,940
to anybody that's going to be able to
beat Cyborg is you're going to have to

1742
01:42:51,941 --> 01:42:54,270
catch her coming in and having her cock.

1743
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:59,780
No girl, no girls beating the
sidebar. No girls being cyborg.

1744
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,140
There's not a girl on this
planet that can beat side,

1745
01:43:02,170 --> 01:43:05,110
but what about that one dude?
The turned into a check.

1746
01:43:05,470 --> 01:43:09,670
She would get fucking dealt with. What? Or

1747
01:43:11,620 --> 01:43:14,740
she lost her last fight?
Fallon. Fox. Ashley. Evan Smith.

1748
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:20,260
Who's in the UFC beat her
dad. Yeah. Nice sideboard.

1749
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:22,500
Beat both of them up at the
same time. Now. I mean she does.

1750
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:23,860
She's such an animal man.

1751
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,790
You seen her spar with like dude and
then that Olympian, she was a shield.

1752
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:30,900
Who's a world champion. Yeah,
like dude, she does not fuck up.

1753
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:33,070
She doesn't fuck around and she's waiting.

1754
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:36,280
This is our last fight on a contract
to, well, you know what man?

1755
01:43:36,281 --> 01:43:40,660
I mean I could easily see someone like
one fc grabbing her as well. Look,

1756
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:42,340
they're grabbing a lot of people now.

1757
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:45,630
It's really interesting to me
grabbing though they have to sign.

1758
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,460
You should tape but that's business.
Well we got Eddie Alvarez.

1759
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:51,650
He just went over there. Three guy,
Demetrius mighty mouse Johnson.

1760
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,700
We just went over there and uh,

1761
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:57,050
they're looking to expand the roster and
I think they're looking to also break

1762
01:43:57,051 --> 01:43:59,270
into the western market place.
You know they have that APP.

1763
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:01,850
You can get the APP and watch
the fights on your phone. Yeah,

1764
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:05,780
I've only seen highlights.
I've only seen highlight to one FC.

1765
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:10,840
I've never seen him watch it for free.
How, how's Belterra today in comparison?

1766
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:14,780
Yes. Bella towards not doing as well
as the UFC, but they're doing well.

1767
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:19,320
They're doing well on the paramount
network. They get pretty good ratings to,

1768
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,040
but they also with Rory
Mcdonald Gig Army Saucy,

1769
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:25,190
then with the heavyweight with bait or
fade or like the heavyweight tournament

1770
01:44:25,191 --> 01:44:26,730
was sick. Yeah, they're doing well.

1771
01:44:26,731 --> 01:44:29,750
The think about Oscar de la Hoya
promoting them and like complete shit.

1772
01:44:29,750 --> 01:44:32,980
Show this one. Not this one.
Do you see the last one I did.

1773
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:37,730
Did you see him at a press
conference? I want to see chuck
and Tito. No, no, no, not,

1774
01:44:37,850 --> 01:44:40,930
it's not a shit show cause it's chuck
and Tito. Do you see Oscar de la Hoya?

1775
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:44,050
He's like, you got, you got
chocolate [inaudible] name wrong.

1776
01:44:44,051 --> 01:44:47,880
Then he goes and then you have these other
guys. How did he go? Check window? Uh,

1777
01:44:48,130 --> 01:44:52,670
I forget it. I lie down. Lie Down.
Everyone used to say chuck lie down.

1778
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:57,530
I used to say at first,
that's what you say in a shyness.

1779
01:44:57,650 --> 01:44:59,990
He didn't know any of the
fighters and he was the first one.

1780
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:01,700
You give them a little bit of that,
but what else did he say?

1781
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:06,980
He goes and then we'll, you know, we have
other fights too. These guys behind me,

1782
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:10,640
I don't know their names, but you know,
I'm not gonna remember their shit. No Way.

1783
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:13,470
Yeah, there's just dead
silence. He's like, you know,

1784
01:45:13,471 --> 01:45:16,310
and when you think of him in May, when
you think of fighters at all, you know,

1785
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:17,180
you just think of these two.

1786
01:45:17,181 --> 01:45:21,980
There's no one else that is the dumbest
way to promote a fight. It was so nice.

1787
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:25,080
Oscar's had, you know how many
professional fights? A lot,

1788
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:29,750
and he snorts all the cocaine. Does he do
all of it? Watch this press conference.

1789
01:45:29,751 --> 01:45:33,530
He's all, and uh, he was like, whoa.
Where it's freezing it does that mean,

1790
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:37,100
is that a fact? No, he's admitted.

1791
01:45:37,101 --> 01:45:40,940
He came on there was the dad abuse prom
and pretty, it's like devil's Dandruff.

1792
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,760
I don't think his love and his Dandruff,

1793
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:46,490
I don't think his love his MMA is
love his boxing. It's just, you know,

1794
01:45:46,491 --> 01:45:49,000
he's doing this one,
you know,

1795
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:53,280
I hope it does well because Tito and chuck
will get benefit the most from it for

1796
01:45:53,281 --> 01:45:57,350
the money. So I want people to buy it
because that reason hammer stone the game.

1797
01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:01,880
No, no. He was my
manager. What? Holy Shit.

1798
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:07,070
Oh yeah, they had long talks. Great
Dude's smart dude. What happened?

1799
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:10,460
Why did he get out of MMA? Because
it's bullshit, you know? He was like,

1800
01:46:10,461 --> 01:46:12,080
why did I like money?
Fuck this sport.

1801
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:19,100
How else is he making money? A dude, he's
one of the first investors in Facebook,

1802
01:46:19,670 --> 01:46:24,440
Twitter, Twitter. So He's filthy
rich. Yeah. Oh Shit. Okay.

1803
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:26,840
He goes, and I remember
he said, he goes, well,

1804
01:46:26,841 --> 01:46:29,600
there's a difference between you and
bankrupt and be an MC hammer. Bankrupt.

1805
01:46:29,690 --> 01:46:34,610
He was, I wasn't like poor. So
you got still balling? Yeah.
Yeah. He started like 12.

1806
01:46:34,611 --> 01:46:39,050
Nine was, he's smart dude,
man. I'm sure. Interesting.

1807
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:42,950
Um, what were we just talking
about before the four MC Hammer.

1808
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:46,340
Amanda Nunez and Chris Herman. No,
no, that was way long. Devil island.

1809
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,930
If you're white, you can't go
to the island anymore. That

1810
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:54,940
will completely lost Yammer.
Uh,

1811
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:59,140
we were talking about promoting,
oh, what fc. Oh, what I've seen,

1812
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:06,690
look, I hope they all do good. We just,
you definitely need like more competition,

1813
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:10,050
more fun. There's more fighters in
there are fights. Right. And uh,

1814
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:14,520
the hard thing though is that
the UFC is like cue tips, right?

1815
01:47:14,521 --> 01:47:16,260
It's like when you think
you don't want cotton swabs,

1816
01:47:16,261 --> 01:47:18,990
give me some fucking cute tips.
They they've got the market. You're,

1817
01:47:18,991 --> 01:47:22,950
there's tissue Kleenex. Yeah, for
now. For now, but there's always,

1818
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:27,240
I don't know if there's such a, it's
such a part of the cultural landscape.

1819
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,930
Like some people go, oh
do you do you UFC? Yeah.

1820
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:34,140
How fucking dare you hoped that they
would get to the point. I would hope,

1821
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,430
this is my goal.

1822
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:40,200
My hope is that a lot of organizations
are like a lot of these boxing

1823
01:47:40,201 --> 01:47:44,640
organizations will you look at like
world champions like Deontay wilder was

1824
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:45,900
about to fight Tyson fury.

1825
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,960
You could have guys that have different
promoters and they worked together some

1826
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:51,300
sort of a deal and then they
put together the fights.

1827
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:55,040
That's better for the fighters if the
fights get in the fighters who both

1828
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:59,010
organizations get it's popular, right.
As you know, it's like Manny Pacquiao,

1829
01:47:59,011 --> 01:47:59,870
fighting Floyd Mayweather.

1830
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:03,030
They had to have these promoters figure
out how to put that fight together.

1831
01:48:03,031 --> 01:48:06,900
Sport better for everyone because we've
been asking is whooping ass over one fc

1832
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:10,320
what you love if he just fought the
champion that you have short Bella tours

1833
01:48:10,321 --> 01:48:12,290
champion like gay army
saucy fight Woodley.

1834
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:15,360
Right now we're fighting fighting
Whitaker. I'd love to see that.

1835
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:19,880
They're going to be very happy
that they signed Ben Aspirin.

1836
01:48:19,890 --> 01:48:21,480
It's going to be fun.
He's smart.

1837
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:25,650
He talks a lot of shit and it took
forever to get him over here and a lot of

1838
01:48:25,651 --> 01:48:27,910
people are in deep shit.
They're in deep shit.

1839
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:30,420
He's going to grab a
hold of them and wrestle.

1840
01:48:30,421 --> 01:48:32,290
Fuck them to the ground
and punch their face.

1841
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:36,210
Isn't that going to be much they going
to be able to do to a lot of people are

1842
01:48:36,211 --> 01:48:37,410
going to be real sharp man.

1843
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:39,850
Like you look at the well he
goes anywhere the chin from that.

1844
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:42,540
The interviews are scrum
for him. Yeah. Look man,

1845
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:44,590
people who've seen the interviews online,
uh,

1846
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:48,150
they seem the podcast that I did with
them, they've seen all of his fights.

1847
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,910
You know, if you watch highlight
reels, you could see all of his fine.

1848
01:48:50,911 --> 01:48:55,350
When I Jack Him off every show we get
every show and then the u s are in one FC.

1849
01:48:55,351 --> 01:48:57,840
They allowed him to needed
the head on the ground too.

1850
01:48:57,870 --> 01:49:01,050
He gets site control now the fuck out
of your head. I'll see. Can't damn man.

1851
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:04,350
It's a nightmare. You can also get north,
south, north, south knees to the head.

1852
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:09,020
Oh my God. Oh my God. Fuck
somebody up is fs one? Yeah.

1853
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:13,680
Oh fuck. Don't say fs. One, one FC. Oh,
when I say, I mean I know what you meant.

1854
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:18,150
Fox sports one hasn't Channel One FC.
I meant but to be able to do that,

1855
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:20,520
to be able to land knees to the
head on the ground like that,

1856
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:22,710
those giant advantage for a restaurant,

1857
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:27,000
giant advantage and to take it away from
them that you like limit like what is

1858
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:28,380
really good about being on top.

1859
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:31,590
It's really good about being on top
is you could smash them anywhere.

1860
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:36,480
It's kind of weird. Those knees. Did
you hear the rumor about Cowboy Connor?

1861
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:41,850
I did. Yeah. It could be sick. Fuck yeah.
I think hope. Can we get that fight?

1862
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,140
I think that's a possibility.

1863
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:47,070
I think that that's a moneymaking fight
and then you may sense for both the guys,

1864
01:49:47,740 --> 01:49:50,770
Connor Connor wants to Coby
rematch, but it's like, dude,

1865
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:54,790
let's get one and then go back that way.
But you got to win. That would be really,

1866
01:49:54,830 --> 01:49:56,320
I'm not saying cowboys and easy fight,

1867
01:49:56,321 --> 01:50:00,430
but it's a better match up then could be
were Tony and then Tony could be fight.

1868
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:03,640
It's going to be interesting to
see what kind of shit talking.

1869
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:09,160
Cause Cowboy did not have a good time
with the shit. Talking of Nate Diaz,

1870
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:13,330
he got in his hat or mosfet out.
He doesn't like that shit.

1871
01:50:13,331 --> 01:50:17,410
Talk doesn't like that Shit. Conor
goes, you guys did that watch.

1872
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:21,220
Then he's going to wrap it up
to 11 until I think cowboy,

1873
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:23,560
if he grabs a of the Connor
and takes him to the ground.

1874
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:25,060
Condoms in a world of shit too.

1875
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:28,350
Cause cowboys a hell of a wrestler and
a Halloween. He's a hell of a striker.

1876
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,600
To me it's a different, it's a
different words. Not An easy fight.

1877
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:34,530
It's gonna be called on the,
as far as the, the odds, I'm,

1878
01:50:34,531 --> 01:50:39,531
I'm assuming Conard barely be a
favorite if 91 55 one 55 Connors,

1879
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:45,460
the the speed that he has,
the one shot Kao power.

1880
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:50,080
Like Connor can do some
shit to motherfuckers and
when you see him fight Eddie

1881
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,400
Alvarez,
that's when you really realize it.

1882
01:50:51,401 --> 01:50:56,320
Like Eddie Alvarez is tough as fuck and
Connor just put it on him. He can start,

1883
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:00,700
he can fuck people up about
cowboy put it on navy too. He did.

1884
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:05,470
But he didn't do it the same way. He
didn't meet his legs. He beat his legs up.

1885
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:08,520
He didn't, he didn't see a
man shot. Connor Dis, Eddie.

1886
01:51:08,710 --> 01:51:11,590
Eddie might've been shots.

1887
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,530
I think that also is a little misleading
cause I feel like a lot of that is

1888
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:18,940
because Conor got into Eddie's head but,
and he's better than that.

1889
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:21,280
Look at that shit and
he's been doing it long.

1890
01:51:21,281 --> 01:51:25,810
Conor McGregor is a two to one favorite.
That doesn't make any sense to me. Well,

1891
01:51:25,811 --> 01:51:27,910
it does make sense and
not as good a wrestler,

1892
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:31,930
which makes sense because you're going
based off of how cowboy won his last

1893
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:35,830
fight. Fallen some tough times. I left
out way more than anyone in this room. But

1894
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,820
he's got the most winning record
in UFC history too, I believe.

1895
01:51:39,821 --> 01:51:43,330
So I'm also going by that. And he
did. He also has one more fun lately.

1896
01:51:43,480 --> 01:51:47,200
Well he looked fantastic
against Mike Perry, the amazing,

1897
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:52,420
but Mike [inaudible] far cry from
congressman. Big Difference. But look,

1898
01:51:52,421 --> 01:51:55,780
I like the fire fighter.
I like to fight a lot.

1899
01:51:55,781 --> 01:51:59,730
And I do agree that if cowboy gets
a hold of anybody on the ground,

1900
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:03,870
he's got crazy ground skills. Calcium,
crazy capital naked holding up a cowboy.

1901
01:52:03,871 --> 01:52:06,430
He's better off his bat.
Cause if Connor would it take him down,

1902
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,770
he would be screwed. But cowboy and tops
not a technician on top. No, I disagree.

1903
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:13,120
You think he's technician on top,

1904
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:16,930
top caliber from his back cupboard
from his back. He's good everywhere.

1905
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:24,640
Yes. Yes. But he'll fuck you up from
the top. He's got, he's got great.

1906
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,620
Most of the submissions are from his back.

1907
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:29,440
That's true because he throws a lot of
kicks and guys take them down and just

1908
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:32,440
snapchat super special off
his back. He, but he's just,

1909
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,880
he's very underrated as a grappler. Yeah.
And you saw many reversed Mike Perry.

1910
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:40,980
Fucking amazing. Fucked his arm up.
How about my parents? He's not, he's,

1911
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:43,990
he left Jackson's, he's like,
dude, I felt like it was, you know,

1912
01:52:43,991 --> 01:52:47,870
I didn't want to be part of came there
to train and all of a sudden I got put in

1913
01:52:47,871 --> 01:52:52,110
the middle of this drama. He left. He
left. Oh, was no longer there. Oh Wow.

1914
01:52:52,150 --> 01:52:54,650
You look great too. I thought
he looked good. He, you know,

1915
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:58,130
obviously you had the hiccup of taking
cowboy down, but I thought Perry,

1916
01:52:58,131 --> 01:53:01,760
like pretty fucking good man.
Yeah, no, Perry did look very good.

1917
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:04,560
He's been looking better and better,
but he just fucked up and took him down.

1918
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,570
That fight was just, cowboy had his
number. Cowboy sparred with him.

1919
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:12,320
Who knows how many times
they also Jackson's. Yeah.
And the, and the grappling,

1920
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:13,940
apparently cowboy dominated him,

1921
01:53:14,060 --> 01:53:17,690
but I guess Perry said in when in their
training camp he was taking so many guys

1922
01:53:17,691 --> 01:53:20,900
down is almost like a natural
reaction from he goes, dude, I just,

1923
01:53:21,680 --> 01:53:23,780
part of the fight just took him down.
David thinking back,

1924
01:53:23,781 --> 01:53:26,330
cause that's what I was doing in
camp. Right. And then Winkeljohn goes,

1925
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:28,760
that was not part of the plan.
We did not want to take cab way down.

1926
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:33,050
So where's he gonna go now? I don't know.
I think he was att before, right? Yeah.

1927
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,000
I don't know.
But for him it men,

1928
01:53:35,001 --> 01:53:39,080
he's getting so much better if he just
stays consistent, gets with a legit cam,

1929
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,250
maybe get his ass up to Tristar were Aka,

1930
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,280
I liked something about going to Montreal.

1931
01:53:46,340 --> 01:53:51,050
Sexy Malkai it's so cold, so
cold. The coldest I've ever been.

1932
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:53,840
Plus in another country,
you know, you just,

1933
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:57,800
it's so far you've got to also just
really super concentrate on what you're

1934
01:53:57,801 --> 01:54:02,120
doing because it's all you're doing.
Yeah. Well I liked beautiful city though.

1935
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:06,500
That's like a strip club
and food.

1936
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:10,310
I can live match allegedly. It's
amazing. I think that could happen.

1937
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:12,050
Like you gotta you gotta beat,

1938
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,860
I think got to be with
some one of the wizards.

1939
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:18,550
There's many great wizards of MMA.

1940
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:21,770
But to really maximize your potential,

1941
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:24,440
you gotta be with someone who can
put it all together. You know,

1942
01:54:24,441 --> 01:54:27,200
and you could pick your favorite wizards,
but one of my favorite ones,

1943
01:54:27,201 --> 01:54:30,440
it's for sure it's for us. I think
he's like one of the best of not him.

1944
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:33,050
Who has the best, one of
the best for sure. The best.

1945
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:38,480
Rufus Matt Hume does not have very
many high level guys that have been,

1946
01:54:38,481 --> 01:54:42,600
I mean he did work with
Maurice though. All right. Yes,

1947
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:46,760
he's in Ca AMC pankration. But he,
um, was a great fighter himself.

1948
01:54:46,761 --> 01:54:49,050
Just great knowledge of the game.
But what he,

1949
01:54:49,051 --> 01:54:53,090
just by proof of what he did with mighty
mouse and the way they talk to each

1950
01:54:53,091 --> 01:54:53,930
other in the corner,

1951
01:54:54,050 --> 01:54:57,110
and you realize like there's a system
they're operating under and they're like,

1952
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:01,190
this is very high level, very
technical, very sophisticated.

1953
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:03,740
They're staying one step
ahead of everything and they
know what they're doing.

1954
01:55:03,770 --> 01:55:07,160
For Demetrius. Demetrius, a
very cerebral, smart fighter.

1955
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:10,550
So that doesn't necessarily mean
my peers can spiel plugin and work.

1956
01:55:10,670 --> 01:55:14,210
That's true to my pastor would do
great somewhere like uh, with uh,

1957
01:55:14,211 --> 01:55:15,780
Jason Parillo in San Diego.

1958
01:55:15,950 --> 01:55:19,550
That could be fucking a dope connection
for them or to find that right.

1959
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:21,860
Coach alliance.
San Diego would be great too.

1960
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:24,860
I feel like that'd be good for him down
there. There's always good spots, man.

1961
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:28,280
But I think that uh, having a fresh look
is not the worst thing in the world,

1962
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:30,270
but I think you can't have too many fresh.
Right.

1963
01:55:30,271 --> 01:55:32,690
So you gotta you gotta
put your roots somewhere,

1964
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:37,490
otherwise you might learn his box.
Jaeger. Mark Henry. Yeah. Wow.

1965
01:55:37,970 --> 01:55:40,730
Phenomenal coach. One of the masterminds.
Yeah, he's one of the masters.

1966
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:44,610
Barboza Edgar.
Eddie Alvarez

1967
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:49,080
also owns a pizza place. Yeah. Is that,
yeah, that's my guy. That was his,

1968
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:51,300
that was his pizza place. You
said it was really good. The best.

1969
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:54,540
He actually tapped you actually send me
a text after you ate that pizza and you

1970
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:57,750
go, I hate the best cause we are
talking about choline is PTA goes,

1971
01:55:57,751 --> 01:55:59,580
I ate the best pizza in the world bro.
I was like,

1972
01:55:59,581 --> 01:56:02,430
well that's a random tax question. I
don't give a shit. It's a different pizza.

1973
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:06,120
I hate to be in that guy. But bagels
and pizza or different over there,

1974
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:08,700
different water, they say,
right. It's different.

1975
01:56:08,730 --> 01:56:11,820
It's a different moisture
in the air on my diet.

1976
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:14,430
I've been so good on my diet and getting,
you know, losing weight for my special,

1977
01:56:14,431 --> 01:56:18,840
but I've been good on my diet. What
are you doing? This special, different,

1978
01:56:18,841 --> 01:56:22,650
fascinating extra cardio. Say
How many hours a week? Uh, man,

1979
01:56:22,651 --> 01:56:26,940
I wake up at six and then I,
I quit eating at 6:00 PM at night,

1980
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:31,200
so 66 and then I don't eat until
usually 10 or 11 the afternoons.

1981
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:36,090
So wow. But anyways, um, anyway,
so, uh, I've been good on my diet,

1982
01:56:36,091 --> 01:56:40,200
but I go to New York next week and
artichoke pizza or King's pizza,

1983
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:43,650
I think it's called King Street. I just
can't turn it down. Artichoke pizzas.

1984
01:56:43,651 --> 01:56:46,990
Your Shit. No, the company's called
our children. I fucking hate artichoke.

1985
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,040
The white pizza. The white sauce.
Now that's not part of the shit.

1986
01:56:50,041 --> 01:56:53,070
You don't like that stuff? Fuck
No. I got to have red sauce man.

1987
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:55,770
But our choke pizza New York.
My mouth's watering bro.

1988
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:58,500
Just some places that
have good white pizza.

1989
01:56:58,501 --> 01:57:03,501
I didn't experience the whole pizza until
I had it at Nikki's in white plains or

1990
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,310
she's pizzeria in white plains,

1991
01:57:05,311 --> 01:57:08,520
New York on the street right down
the street from executive billiards.

1992
01:57:08,640 --> 01:57:11,130
They had white pizza that will
knock your dick write in the dirt.

1993
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:15,910
It had melted butter and garlic on it
and and ham and shit and you'd bite and

1994
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:19,100
he'd be like holding. A lot of
Italians were in white white plains.

1995
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:23,700
I mean he still to,
this is not my favorite is white castle.

1996
01:57:23,701 --> 01:57:26,910
Is White Castle still around?
I remember white castle or small burgers.

1997
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:31,920
Burgers they make are Regan one
grow. They make it Vegan. White Cow.

1998
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:34,100
Fuck yeah.

1999
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:41,280
I'm pretty sure white castle for
only then make a Vegan Burger.

2000
01:57:41,281 --> 01:57:44,490
Now White Castle does,
which is like,

2001
01:57:45,180 --> 01:57:49,770
that's literally like buying a,
a vitamin from a poison factory.

2002
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:54,080
That's a bad idea. Vitamins
too. Yeah. Yeah. Bad at night.

2003
01:57:54,210 --> 01:57:58,890
If you're a Vegan and like
you're buying Vegan Burgers,

2004
01:57:58,891 --> 01:58:01,430
soy from a company that rounders,

2005
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:06,840
millions of animals a year.
Impossible Burger.

2006
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:09,030
You feel better. Wow. How about Taco Bell?

2007
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:14,240
Taco bell puts essentially sand
it while sodium bicarbonate,

2008
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:18,230
Bro. Hey, no silicon by
carbon. I think I'll still go

2009
01:58:20,090 --> 01:58:24,060
there. There be filling. They're
not allowed to call it beef filling.

2010
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,610
They have to call it Taco
filling because it's not beef.

2011
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:31,350
That beef has silicone in it
to make it fuller and more. Um,

2012
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:35,310
look it up. That shit.
That shit is delicious. Oh,

2013
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:39,950
look up what's in Taco Bell. How
would you doubt that? Why do you,

2014
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:44,480
how would you need for
this Taco Bell Taco?

2015
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:48,520
That's a conspiracy theory.
A double decker Taco.

2016
01:58:48,521 --> 01:58:53,210
I don't give a fuck you bro.
There's no youtube blame.

2017
01:58:53,211 --> 01:58:56,290
It's not real. Is calen
true? Where'd you hear this?

2018
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,760
Silica. Silica. Brian,

2019
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:03,880
I believe you were
talking about Taco Bell.

2020
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:08,940
It's not in their isolated oat product.
Some chili pepper, onion powder,

2021
01:59:10,330 --> 01:59:15,220
silicon dioxide, anti caking Asia.
Now look that up. So carbon dioxide,

2022
01:59:15,221 --> 01:59:20,050
sugar, please. Agent, how about that?
You guys love Taco? Okay, go guys.

2023
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:23,590
What does it say? Anti kicking nature
to avoid clumping and supplements.

2024
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:26,740
It's used to prevent the various powdered
ingredients from sticking together as

2025
01:59:26,741 --> 01:59:27,610
many food additives.

2026
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:32,611
Consumers have often often have concerns
about silicon dioxide as an additive.

2027
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,083
Is it safe?

2028
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:39,340
Is it Sam to see that that they put in
there also frequently found in health

2029
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:41,510
food nutritional supplements
as an additive cells.

2030
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:45,040
Silicon dioxide primarily
functions as an anti kicking agent,

2031
01:59:45,041 --> 01:59:47,140
which prevents ingredients
from binding together,

2032
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:52,090
but it doesn't say if it's cancerous
carcinogen.

2033
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:55,860
Look at this proven carcinogen.
Well who set on Mcdonald's?

2034
01:59:55,950 --> 02:00:00,540
Answer their buns. So silk industrial
side is he proven carcinogen wives,

2035
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:04,000
Mcdonald's opt to use this in buns,
potentially hurting human health.

2036
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:07,150
Silicon is categorized
as a trace mineral then,

2037
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:11,860
which means that it's needed in minimal
amounts to maintain health as his

2038
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,480
requirement.
It's very small.

2039
02:00:13,481 --> 02:00:17,760
It's recommended daily allowance for
silicon has not been specified cause this

2040
02:00:17,761 --> 02:00:20,200
is not food.
However,

2041
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:24,580
experts suggested a daily consumption and
the range of 2030 milligrams is needed

2042
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:27,780
to stay healthy.
Who I wrote that cause that Mcdonald's,

2043
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:36,690
Mcdonald's [inaudible] I guess
just a trace mineral maybe.

2044
02:00:37,391 --> 02:00:41,440
But maybe it is. Yeah,
it's important for sure.

2045
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:44,800
But you know it has, you know, if
kid has like a slimy thing on it.

2046
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:49,330
Here's the thing. If they can't really say
all this, if it's not true, if they do,

2047
02:00:49,331 --> 02:00:50,320
they get in deep shit.

2048
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:54,700
So it might be real that
silicon is a trace mineral.

2049
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:56,650
It's an important part of our own feed.
But it also,

2050
02:00:56,651 --> 02:00:59,740
you're putting dirt in your burgers.
Crow. It's also a food food grade.

2051
02:00:59,741 --> 02:01:04,680
So maybe it's different. So it's like
why is it in there though? Even if you,

2052
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:08,530
you're saying it so Katie,
it doesn't kick up right?

2053
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:12,280
You can't have a cookie.
Can have cake filler man.

2054
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:13,640
36% beef.

2055
02:01:13,690 --> 02:01:18,690
Oh it's only 36% beef and talked to
other 64% is a wide range of fillers.

2056
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:22,780
It cocoa powder over this 36% beef,

2057
02:01:22,781 --> 02:01:25,420
64% is made with fillers.

2058
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:30,550
Don't we all know and preserve
of know that this is 100% beef

2059
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,920
cow killed. You really think it was 64%
I don't think when I eat that, I'm like,

2060
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:40,130
listen man,
this isn't

2061
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:42,140
going to be good.
I'm going to shit my pants,

2062
02:01:42,260 --> 02:01:44,290
but I love their fucking tostadas status.

2063
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:47,420
Have you heard that conspiracy
theory that Mcdonald's,

2064
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:51,440
you know it says hundred percent beef
that that's an actual trademark name,

2065
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,830
hundred percent and beef. Is
that for real? We're just not.

2066
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:59,120
Don't they can say that? Then they can
get sued? No, no, no. It was like a,

2067
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:02,520
it was like their beef.
They're called

2068
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:09,110
beef even though it's 40% right. That's
the conspiracy theory. So I don't know.

2069
02:02:09,111 --> 02:02:10,200
I don't really know if that's true.

2070
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:14,600
Is Mcdonald's is same as Taco bell in
terms of like what percentage of it is

2071
02:02:14,601 --> 02:02:19,110
actually beef up their chicken? The
one thing that's really weird about it,

2072
02:02:19,111 --> 02:02:22,210
that's not the one thing that's
fucked up about the beef.

2073
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:23,900
You getting hamburger from the thousands.

2074
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:28,100
Those cows can come from 10
different parts of the globe.

2075
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:32,780
So you're eating the the cows from
China, Argentina, United States.

2076
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:37,340
Who gives all his cows were killed and
killed. Then it's brought together.

2077
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:40,160
So one cab,
Bro.

2078
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:44,000
I don't give him my burner has come
from ice to know cow's name. I have to,

2079
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:47,090
I'll tell you though,
I think the healthiest,

2080
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:51,530
healthiest thing for you at
Mcdonald's doesn't make no oil.

2081
02:02:51,540 --> 02:02:55,700
Fish is made from real food
change. The label fishes. Awesome.

2082
02:02:55,701 --> 02:03:00,600
Have you had a MCRIB? Those are real
ribs. You know they take me to present,

2083
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:03,840
rebuild. They take me and form
it as a fucking, is that true?

2084
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:09,020
Let's read the Mcdonald Mcdonald things.
Not True. I love make that larger.

2085
02:03:09,021 --> 02:03:12,890
Please. I want a fish sandwich,
Eddie. Well, smaller again,
so it fits the screen.

2086
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,420
There you go.
Whether it's a fascinating premise,

2087
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:15,740
there is nothing to at Mcdonald's.

2088
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:20,570
Hamburger patties in the u s are
made with 100% us da inspected beef.

2089
02:03:20,750 --> 02:03:24,230
They're cooked to prepare with salt,
pepper and nothing else. No preservatives,

2090
02:03:24,231 --> 02:03:28,190
no fillers to punk. So it's
pretty healthy. It's debunked.

2091
02:03:28,370 --> 02:03:31,970
How's that possible? That's 100%
what are your top of that site?

2092
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,100
What is the title of it?

2093
02:03:33,110 --> 02:03:37,280
Our Mcdonald's hamburgers hundred percent
beef taco bell. Get on that train.

2094
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:39,810
They're just like, Nah, fuck. And
they're like, fuck it. We just get,

2095
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:43,040
you know it's Shitty for you. Yeah,
they're way worse than Mcdonald's.

2096
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:49,640
Mcdonald's buys their meat from a company
called 100% beef. That's not true.

2097
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:54,920
That's not true. Well that's the
conspiracy ball thing. It's false.

2098
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:56,990
So it is.
Look man,

2099
02:03:56,991 --> 02:04:00,020
you could probably get beef pretty
God damn cheap if you do it that way.

2100
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:01,470
Just grinded all day.

2101
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:07,100
I still like del Taco and
all that stuff is so gross.

2102
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:10,940
But if you go to a real taco spot bromine,
you have a at Mcdonald's,

2103
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:16,980
Mcdonald's fuck up. I will fuck up an
egg mcmuffin and we'll fuck of it. I

2104
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:24,740
think it's an egg. Here's the thing,
if you get egg mcmuffin with ham,

2105
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:28,760
they really can't fuck with that.
You get that sausage.

2106
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:31,210
Who knows what's in that shit on.
But if you get

2107
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:39,870
curious now the eggs actually and lately
they that they make there what the egg

2108
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:43,050
Mcdonald's said that they, that the
amount chickens and eggs they use now,

2109
02:04:43,051 --> 02:04:45,570
they don't have,
I think they don't use antibiotics.

2110
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:50,940
The kick tinny eggs that are freshly
cracked in Mcdonald's restaurants.

2111
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:52,080
That's impressed.
The chains.

2112
02:04:52,081 --> 02:04:55,230
Egg items such as scrambled eggs and
egg whites are made from liquid eggs.

2113
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,970
But so that's what you go.

2114
02:04:56,971 --> 02:04:59,750
Will you go with the regular chicken
or you go with a regular egg?

2115
02:04:59,751 --> 02:05:02,180
Mcmuffins who doesn't get
egg on their egg muffin?

2116
02:05:02,280 --> 02:05:05,930
I'm gonna just get to the sausage
patty. Well, the sausage patties,

2117
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:10,480
you don't know what you're getting
with that taste like bacon. No sausage.

2118
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:14,550
White Chase. They're scientists and
they're working on tastes for real.

2119
02:05:14,551 --> 02:05:19,230
They do a good job on it. We're do a good
job soaked in syrup. What about that?

2120
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:23,850
You're talking about, let me grill
McGriddle it's brilliant. It's brilliant.

2121
02:05:24,410 --> 02:05:28,260
It's candy. Candy had an fair
should. It's very good. I like it.

2122
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:32,880
I feel good when I eat it. Who the
fuck whores flail fish filet of fish.

2123
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:35,930
I love. I never had one. You're the
first person that we're talking about it.

2124
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:40,770
It's like dessert now lunch.
They're very good. They're good.

2125
02:05:40,771 --> 02:05:42,510
And that should post that tartar sauce.

2126
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:47,550
I send him the best cars in and out of
the best hamburgers right now. Five guys.

2127
02:05:47,551 --> 02:05:51,410
Pretty God damn good to have five guys.
Five guys would slice Jalapenos sued off.

2128
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,720
Tell you fucked shake shack is very shaky.
Jack's delicious.

2129
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:59,700
You got no shit dude. You can't
play does it? Fucking right.

2130
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:03,440
Can't know where to have Sunday. No
fucking beef. Chicken sandwiches the best.

2131
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:07,890
Which one? Chick-Filet it's good.
It's good. It's good. Fuck good.

2132
02:06:07,891 --> 02:06:09,570
That's pretty good chick.
Filets delicious.

2133
02:06:09,571 --> 02:06:12,310
They made their name off that God damn
sandwich and I'll take something else

2134
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:17,320
cause I got pickles and stuff now shake
shack that Jalapeno smoked Jalapeno

2135
02:06:18,390 --> 02:06:22,350
Bacon Burger. Now get the fuck
Outta here right now. Cash.

2136
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:27,010
I just get a whopper with cheese.
Ketchup only from campfire beef.

2137
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:30,530
Cheap shit. You can't fuck with it bro.

2138
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:35,630
I have to be fucking super hungry in
the middle of the desert on the way to

2139
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,120
Fresno for me to fuck with King.

2140
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:43,730
Be desperate to that stupid wouldn't
king that they had at that dumb ad.

2141
02:06:43,731 --> 02:06:47,580
I saw it enemies though. I'm
down with Wendy's. I love
Wendy's. I love their fries.

2142
02:06:47,581 --> 02:06:52,110
Wendy's on another level. See, I'm
a really burger king. Burger King.

2143
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:54,720
When I'm done with the show him,
there's nothing else open.

2144
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:56,610
I'll go to burger king.
You know what?

2145
02:06:56,970 --> 02:07:01,170
Get me two fucking whoppers ketchup
on over Mickey D's. Oh yeah.

2146
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:06,570
With Wendy's. Beef has never frozen.
That's how they get you squared.

2147
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:09,360
We worked at Mcdonald's for a,

2148
02:07:09,450 --> 02:07:13,530
with us for three weeks when I was a 17
year old and a bit, you were terrible.

2149
02:07:13,620 --> 02:07:17,370
We dropped the burgers and put it back
on the grill and we showed them son of a

2150
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:21,720
man ruined people's fucked up when we
were younger. We did it by accident.

2151
02:07:21,721 --> 02:07:24,220
I didn't want to waste the food.
Whatever.

2152
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:29,690
You know a good Italian sub with
like melted parmesan cheese.

2153
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:34,420
Talking about the meatball
sub from subway. Jared go bro.

2154
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:36,130
Tuna,

2155
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:39,350
at subway. I'll fuck with that.
Yeah, but not from subway.

2156
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:41,860
You're talking about a real subject.
Blimpie's

2157
02:07:44,180 --> 02:07:47,290
Deli.
Quizno's come on

2158
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:50,303
guy.

2159
02:07:51,020 --> 02:07:54,700
You go to an Italian Deli in Boston or
New York and where they have the hands

2160
02:07:54,701 --> 02:07:59,570
hanging from the ceiling where the guys
at 90 year old guy can get that base

2161
02:07:59,600 --> 02:08:00,840
cities in Vancouver,

2162
02:08:00,850 --> 02:08:04,660
the basic cracked the fucking
place on mother as good as it gets,

2163
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:09,130
have a red is shit down your throat.
It's delicious. It's unbelievable.

2164
02:08:09,160 --> 02:08:12,310
There's some spots bases. Unbelievable.
Why don't more people do that?

2165
02:08:12,311 --> 02:08:16,810
Like when you go to a real
Italian restaurant or real
Italian sub shop and you

2166
02:08:16,811 --> 02:08:21,190
get like sausage and peppers with tomato
sauce. Damn, I'm so good. You're like,

2167
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:26,110
okay, who? Why don't they figure out how
to sell this more places? No, I know.

2168
02:08:26,111 --> 02:08:30,250
Quality is expensive, Bro.
It is, but it's so God damn.

2169
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:33,970
You're like, okay, well all these
like little cheeseburger spots.

2170
02:08:34,060 --> 02:08:37,960
How come you can't have a sausage
peppers hoping in Hoboken,

2171
02:08:37,961 --> 02:08:39,940
New Jersey in the 90s all Italian.

2172
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:43,570
You'd go to those fucking Dallas
and they'd had the water Mozzarella.

2173
02:08:43,571 --> 02:08:44,530
They're making it in the back.

2174
02:08:44,531 --> 02:08:49,070
They'd make the Mozzarella and they put
that shit on a, an Italian sub get, oh my.

2175
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:54,460
What's that right there? Send genero
seats engineer's face. Yeah. Yeah.

2176
02:08:54,820 --> 02:08:58,300
That's a little little. And they
always have these big sausage vendors.

2177
02:08:58,600 --> 02:09:02,070
Just giant grill sausages laid out.

2178
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:04,780
You're walking by and you get one
and immediately just delighted.

2179
02:09:08,090 --> 02:09:12,620
Just busted in your mouse. Oh
my God. Did the bread bread.

2180
02:09:12,630 --> 02:09:15,730
It's just got this density to
it. And you're like, Holy Shit.

2181
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:18,670
You guys ever fuck with the
kitchen sink cookie? What's that?

2182
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:23,290
The kitchen sink cookies. All ingredients
are in the cookie at Panera bread.

2183
02:09:24,690 --> 02:09:27,480
They got a cookie called the
kitchen sink. It's five bucks, dude.

2184
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:30,880
This is a good thing. Only usually
fucking chocolate chip cookies.

2185
02:09:30,881 --> 02:09:33,400
I don't fuck with Colton
meal or cinnamon cookie.

2186
02:09:33,401 --> 02:09:35,320
It's gotta be a good
chocolate chip cookie. I mean,

2187
02:09:35,321 --> 02:09:36,490
maybe some peanut butter in there,

2188
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:40,960
but kitchen sink has fucking
everything and it's addicting as fit.

2189
02:09:40,961 --> 02:09:44,320
You've got to be high, right? No, no, no,
no. You know what? There was a Panera,

2190
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:48,100
Panera bread next to chipotle I,
so I go to chipotle and go get the salad.

2191
02:09:48,220 --> 02:09:52,750
No fucking no burrito. I'm going with the
south site clean. I clean it. Chipotle,

2192
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:55,390
and then the Panera bread's
right next door. And I'm like,

2193
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:59,800
should I just walk to my car and just
get in and drive the fuck away or am I

2194
02:09:59,801 --> 02:10:03,100
going to go next door and fuck
this all up and get a kitchen sink?

2195
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:04,780
So I've always had to struggle.

2196
02:10:04,781 --> 02:10:08,950
I go to chipotle and I'm eating like an
Olympian at AAA and then I walk out and

2197
02:10:08,951 --> 02:10:12,280
sometimes they get in my car just fucking
burn rubber and I'm out. But it's,

2198
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:16,360
it's been, uh, a problem of
mine. But luckily, luckily,

2199
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:21,540
luckily I struggle with the
same. Seriously. I had a
salad. No, that's not it.

2200
02:10:21,580 --> 02:10:26,170
I had a salad and I walked out and I
was know I was on the fence of whether I

2201
02:10:26,171 --> 02:10:28,330
should get a kitchen sink. And I
said, fuck it. I'm going to get it.

2202
02:10:28,510 --> 02:10:31,980
And I walked next door and the
place closed down probably for like,

2203
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,130
Holy Shit was a legit,

2204
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,770
totally, I feel good now. Now there's,
I don't, I don't have a choice.

2205
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,860
What are you showing us? These
are the rocks. Cheat meal cookies.

2206
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:43,910
Have you seen him? He goes to the
flyers to some special place in Hawaii.

2207
02:10:43,911 --> 02:10:47,220
Just for them. They're like fun cooking.
It's like a cookie instead of cookies.

2208
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:52,230
I eat
six ounces.

2209
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:57,290
I'm going to one of the islands. What
are you doing out there and comedy son.

2210
02:10:57,390 --> 02:11:01,160
Damn. No, I'm going to in Hawaii, man.

2211
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:04,080
Wow.
Who or some shit going

2212
02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:11,840
bro. Tollhouse cookies telling us
closer to the Philippines or something.

2213
02:11:11,841 --> 02:11:16,540
Right. Is it specific? Was it closer
to Hawaii or closer to the foot?

2214
02:11:16,560 --> 02:11:19,910
Closer to the, I think it's
closer to Hawaii. I think
it's like a thousand miles.

2215
02:11:20,150 --> 02:11:23,400
It's pretty far,
but how does anyone starving and yeah,

2216
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:29,570
I know him. I know a Mexican spot.
It's like a legit, a Mexican spot.

2217
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:32,390
Not that one I threw up at, right?
No, no, no. Remember that front one

2218
02:11:35,220 --> 02:11:39,590
Italian style. It's still there.
Yeah. We hit the bomb too hard.

2219
02:11:40,030 --> 02:11:44,540
We got a stomach. When was this?
Many, many, many years ago.

2220
02:11:44,550 --> 02:11:45,830
More than that.
More than 10.

2221
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:50,130
More than 10 like 18 it was
hot as fuck during the day.

2222
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:53,060
Empty stomach. We're about
to go eat, get some burritos,

2223
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:56,120
and he wanted to stop at a
head shop and get a bong.

2224
02:11:56,420 --> 02:12:01,130
So he got them bomb and all yet. And
I was thirsty as fuck. It was hot.

2225
02:12:01,370 --> 02:12:05,930
We decided to hit the bottom before I
went to the burrito place and suburbs,

2226
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,460
hottest fucking all he had in him. He
had a case of red bulls, right stomach.

2227
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:14,600
I took two cause every little, so I took
to, that was, it was high. I was thirsty,

2228
02:12:15,020 --> 02:12:19,740
hit up, got gigantic
dragon head, this bond,

2229
02:12:20,070 --> 02:12:23,900
we walked, we walked
to caffeine, caffeine,

2230
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:27,860
stomach empty sounds a big one.
That a real bad experience.

2231
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:31,040
So we walk into the Burrito shop and

2232
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:36,050
nobody was ever that. We'd walk and we
were always the only, the only people.

2233
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:37,790
So it was like,
how the fuck are they making money?

2234
02:12:37,791 --> 02:12:41,150
Are they like bringing food from home?
You know what I mean? But anyways,

2235
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:43,700
the room started spinning.

2236
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:47,690
I thought like I was gonna throw up and
I just walked out of that place and just,

2237
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:52,010
I needed to find a bush. And I, as
soon as I walked off like 20 yards,

2238
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:55,820
I saw Bush and I thought, I'm
not going to make it, man.

2239
02:12:56,090 --> 02:12:58,130
And I made a fucking beeline for the bush,

2240
02:12:58,131 --> 02:13:01,100
but then I collapsed halfway
through on my hands and knees,

2241
02:13:01,101 --> 02:13:05,180
just puking all over the sidewalk
and I'm trying to drag myself.

2242
02:13:05,390 --> 02:13:08,450
And then I puked here.
I took a couple more crawls,

2243
02:13:08,451 --> 02:13:12,230
steps had puked again three or four times.
I finally got to the Bush,

2244
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:17,240
had a couple more, a couple more,
uh, um, uh, ounces for the bush.

2245
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:20,300
And then I felt great after I
threw up, I felt great, but man,

2246
02:13:20,301 --> 02:13:24,410
I left the crime scene all over there.
Go back and eat again.

2247
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:27,310
I left the place. He's, he's freaking
out. He's like, I got to go outside.

2248
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:30,050
I gotta check, I gotta find a Bush,
I'm going to Puke. I'm like, no way.

2249
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:32,160
He goes outside of,
I wasn't sure,

2250
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,740
like, what do I do? Do I order the
fleet? Do I help them? Do I wait? So,

2251
02:13:35,741 --> 02:13:38,220
and then I was like, how serious
is this? And I went outside.

2252
02:13:38,221 --> 02:13:41,070
He's on his hands and knees.
Pukes flying out of him.

2253
02:13:41,071 --> 02:13:43,190
He's crawling behind the corner to what?

2254
02:13:43,191 --> 02:13:47,220
He's his work and he's hurl and into
the bushes. Wait, this is ridiculous.

2255
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:51,000
Jimmy Chin. We're barbecued.
I mean, so the whole is this,

2256
02:13:51,010 --> 02:13:54,440
this isn't the same Mexican place. You
were just talking about different stories.

2257
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:58,410
This the other place, they don't even
speak English to them to take you guys to,

2258
02:13:58,411 --> 02:14:01,260
they didn't even speak English.
I'm driving. It's phenomenal.

2259
02:14:01,290 --> 02:14:03,170
I'm driving from central park.

2260
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:06,670
I'm driving from Calabasas is just down
the PCH and it's just a windy, you know,

2261
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:08,910
through Topanga Canyon kind of,
well,

2262
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:11,880
I had Jimmy Burke in the car
who doesn't drive in cars.

2263
02:14:11,881 --> 02:14:15,810
He lives in New York City. So he is
used to walking or riding his bike.

2264
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:19,890
He never drives in cars.
So as we're going down,

2265
02:14:19,891 --> 02:14:22,900
I'm just taking it for granted and I'm
just seeing zing. Zing, zing though he,

2266
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,930
and he goes like this, hey,
we get to the bottom. He goes,

2267
02:14:25,380 --> 02:14:28,170
has Baba you gotta pull over
right now. I go, why? He goes,

2268
02:14:28,470 --> 02:14:32,640
I think I'm going to die.
Go. What happened? He goes,
you're swerving. He got out.

2269
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:36,480
He was on his hands and knees and we
waited there for 45 minutes cause he

2270
02:14:36,481 --> 02:14:37,320
couldn't get back in the car.

2271
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:40,080
That's how fucked up and threw
up and just kept throwing up.

2272
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:43,470
Brian Killen you ever think you
drive like an asshole? No. No.

2273
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:47,780
He just wasn't used to it. Jesus.
Maybe I just hugged you ever.

2274
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:52,730
If you're super sick, if I'm on my
phone in the car, you a driver to,

2275
02:14:52,731 --> 02:14:55,590
you're going to back on my phone.
I can read those either. Don't.

2276
02:14:55,610 --> 02:15:00,120
Don't try to read a book with ears.
I get so sick when I do that.

2277
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:03,300
You have to put my phone down
to concentrate on the horizon.

2278
02:15:03,330 --> 02:15:08,280
Just slowly dissipate, but just focus
on the horizon. I get so sick with that.

2279
02:15:08,281 --> 02:15:12,820
I can read in a car if you
ever got seasick and I can
read. I can fuck what? Whoa,

2280
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:17,870
whoa dude. While you're driving or what?
Someone else, I get sucked in the back.

2281
02:15:20,290 --> 02:15:21,123
So

2282
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:28,590
the idea that you would be driving
one of those cars and it runs out of

2283
02:15:28,591 --> 02:15:33,180
batteries is what scares me the most.
I've had it happen where a, that's a lie.

2284
02:15:33,210 --> 02:15:33,691
It never happened,

2285
02:15:33,691 --> 02:15:36,760
but I was having a cigarette and I just
made it into my driveway. I remember.

2286
02:15:36,770 --> 02:15:37,560
Yeah,

2287
02:15:37,560 --> 02:15:40,980
I remember we were someone you have to
stop and charge it to look up a charge

2288
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:44,330
plus zero gets you. How long? Uh,

2289
02:15:44,520 --> 02:15:49,290
I've only like couple miles on zero. So
you don't want to fuck with it. But I, I,

2290
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:52,140
it happened to me twice very
recently where I pulled into my,

2291
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:55,290
to Sony and they plugged it in.
I was zero and zero,

2292
02:15:55,330 --> 02:16:00,300
but soon it takes forever. It takes
forever to fucking charge. Fill up.

2293
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:03,300
Yeah, man, it's a bummer for
hours, you know, we'll get you,

2294
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:07,500
you need six hours to get a hundred for
a hundred percent. Really seven hours.

2295
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:10,740
Right. Wow. Yeah. Depending on,
and if you were on the charger,

2296
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:13,590
if you got that Tesla charger,
you got an hour here,

2297
02:16:14,350 --> 02:16:18,210
an hour even less. Can you get
this at your crib? That's like,

2298
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:23,660
I saw them at the movie theater the other
day. Yeah. They can't get those movies.

2299
02:16:23,670 --> 02:16:28,550
You see, uh, we saw the, um, the
new record mouth reg urology. Yes.

2300
02:16:28,570 --> 02:16:30,390
It's very,
take my kid out of my weird though,

2301
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:34,620
Sarah Silvermans divorce voice to this
little girl. And so obviously Sarah sub,

2302
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:38,260
she's great in it. Yeah.
But it's so obviously her to
me, I'm like, Oh, Hey Sarah.

2303
02:16:38,290 --> 02:16:42,020
I liked her one hour. I saw half of it
anyway. I really liked the shit. She all,

2304
02:16:42,050 --> 02:16:46,810
she seen her murder.
She's such a good comp store.

2305
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:53,320
Silver. Very, very good comment. Yeah. I
think maybe the best, best female female.

2306
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:56,560
That's what I mean. Yeah. Dude.
Trevor Noah's special on Netflix.

2307
02:16:56,561 --> 02:17:01,000
It's funny as fuck isn't it?
It's really funny. I heard
mixed reviews. Really? Yeah.

2308
02:17:01,001 --> 02:17:03,050
Since you said that. But I mean,
you know, it's all, it's awesome.

2309
02:17:03,110 --> 02:17:07,120
Jackie made me laugh. It's awesome. Type
of a car. Brian judges you. It's true.

2310
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:12,700
Maybe you don't like the same humor
now. Isaiah fury the purple car. Uh,

2311
02:17:12,701 --> 02:17:17,370
it's just like two peacocks.
Peacocky it's just like, hey,

2312
02:17:17,371 --> 02:17:20,590
he's the way he dresses. He just,
I know what he's going to do.

2313
02:17:20,591 --> 02:17:25,090
Like I know that that one Porsche wasn't
enough and he's like, I got a picture,

2314
02:17:25,180 --> 02:17:27,940
it'll just, he'll just send me
a random picture. And I'm like,

2315
02:17:28,090 --> 02:17:30,730
don't you fucking do it.
Of course he needs the purple.

2316
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:33,010
Do you think if you got rid of this Tesla,

2317
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:35,560
and I know you want to have a car that
has a back seat where you could take your

2318
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:38,560
kids and you drove a nine 11.
I've driven one.

2319
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:43,950
When was the last one I drove Arnold
Schwartzenegger nine 11 Porsche turbo.

2320
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:47,350
When was that? As he put it up for
sale and my friend and he said,

2321
02:17:47,351 --> 02:17:52,250
I got a surprise for you in 88
or some shit. Two thousands,

2322
02:17:52,750 --> 02:17:56,940
2000. It's a great car. But the
problem is it's, it's, it's just a lot.

2323
02:17:57,010 --> 02:18:00,520
I think it was a stick, you know, and
traffic and shit. I'm just too lazy.

2324
02:18:00,521 --> 02:18:04,460
I'm not a driver. You have to order a
stick. Most of them don't. This head, uh,

2325
02:18:04,770 --> 02:18:07,690
this had a special interior.
Like it was beautiful car. Yeah.

2326
02:18:07,691 --> 02:18:10,240
What I'm saying is it causes drove one.

2327
02:18:10,360 --> 02:18:14,410
If you drove like a nine 11 and automatic
one, amazing. You would love it,

2328
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:18,580
I'm sure. But then again, I really
love that test. I think my lease is up.

2329
02:18:18,581 --> 02:18:22,270
So the question is to really
get a Panamera. What do I
get? When's the lease up?

2330
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:24,640
March.
But I can trade it in or writing.

2331
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:28,240
Well you know there's benefits to both,
right?

2332
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:32,410
There's benefits of the electric thing
is it's pretty dope. It's fast as shit.

2333
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:36,520
Yeah. Off the line. There's no gears.
Right. So just like there's no shifting.

2334
02:18:36,550 --> 02:18:38,920
You don't care about speed.
I like pickup.

2335
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:41,950
I like pickup and I liked the fact that
it parks itself and I liked the fact

2336
02:18:41,951 --> 02:18:45,970
that it drives itself. And
once the traffic, if I'm in
traffic I'll go like that.

2337
02:18:45,971 --> 02:18:47,170
I hit this thing and I just stand.

2338
02:18:47,171 --> 02:18:51,040
The editors drives in bumper to bumper
and I never have to touch the wheel.

2339
02:18:51,041 --> 02:18:54,640
So yeah, I hear you now, but you're
going slow. You're not stop and start.

2340
02:18:54,641 --> 02:18:57,490
That's tiring. It's annoying. Yeah.

2341
02:18:57,850 --> 02:19:00,490
Have your hand on the wheel a little bit
lightly and just, you can read a book.

2342
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:03,760
I don't know about that
drive the goddamn color.

2343
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:06,820
Once you have cars driving for you,
it's the future.

2344
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:10,590
But we're all going to be
eventually it will. Yeah.

2345
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:15,270
Kids aren't gonna get drivers driver
license or way down. There's like Uber's,

2346
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:19,210
why would we drive you old fuck
really? Uber everywhere. Yeah.

2347
02:19:19,530 --> 02:19:22,410
Driver's in getting drivers. Uber, Uber.

2348
02:19:22,810 --> 02:19:26,430
It's is a little dangerous because
those Uber drivers is weird as fuck.

2349
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:28,070
Gonna have driverless. Uber isn't, then

2350
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:32,350
we're just going to get in no way. You're
going to let a car drive itself like on

2351
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:37,820
this new Tesla has so many cameras.
Like it just parked for me.

2352
02:19:37,821 --> 02:19:41,600
Like the download I, I went, I called my
buddy goes, cause you know this works.

2353
02:19:41,601 --> 02:19:45,440
My Buddy Jeff and I go, no. And he goes,
watch this. And I pushed this park.

2354
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:49,610
I stood there, it parked it
parallel, parked so fast and well,

2355
02:19:49,670 --> 02:19:53,810
so much better. I didn't have to do, I
sat there and it just went. I was like,

2356
02:19:53,811 --> 02:19:57,420
are you made me feel like less of a man?
But you get lazy.

2357
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,190
It's just easy. After a while.
That's ridiculous. Hit a button.

2358
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:05,270
That's so sounds like what people probably
said when the printing press came out.

2359
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:08,030
I know you're not going to write
your words. You're not going to get

2360
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:14,020
no, no. I'm not talking about
pride or anything like that. I'm,

2361
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:17,180
you're going to be driving
on the freeway 65 miles.

2362
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:21,740
That's eventually she's going to
get so good. No, I don't. I don't.

2363
02:20:21,790 --> 02:20:25,760
That would make me eventually fall.
That makes me way more than other people.

2364
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:29,200
There's so many accident, dumb
asses. They're reading their phone.

2365
02:20:29,201 --> 02:20:33,590
It was some lady should someone else
car that I'm in reading hard that I'm in

2366
02:20:33,740 --> 02:20:35,770
because she didn't know.
Traffic just goes in the Middle Lane,

2367
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:38,810
middle and just stopped dead.
A woman I work with,

2368
02:20:38,811 --> 02:20:42,410
her mother was killed by a
distracted rights and driving killed,

2369
02:20:42,530 --> 02:20:45,130
killed her mother. They say it's
going to take over drunk driving.

2370
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:46,600
Everything takes him driving to be number.

2371
02:20:47,570 --> 02:20:49,730
Every time I see someone
driving fucked up,

2372
02:20:49,790 --> 02:20:52,170
I always pull up next to him and
they're always on their phone. Oh,

2373
02:20:52,370 --> 02:20:55,970
it's like 89 90% of the time.
It's not the other.

2374
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:57,390
It's just people just should.

2375
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:00,900
They should make it so that your phone
doesn't work while you're driving. Right.

2376
02:21:01,360 --> 02:21:03,950
You're throwing shot this an
option in the new iPhones,

2377
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:08,440
there's an option to locks. Locks
you out of everything. Yeah.

2378
02:21:08,630 --> 02:21:12,430
When he takes those. I'm driving right
now and we'll give you a tech. Yeah. Yeah.

2379
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:16,620
I mean, one of these days it
might be mandatory. Right? Well,

2380
02:21:16,621 --> 02:21:18,950
she cannot be on your
phone while you're driving,

2381
02:21:18,980 --> 02:21:22,850
unfortunately by take a tragedy. That
is, well that is a law. That is a lot

2382
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:27,050
good hands free system.
You can do a lot of shit.

2383
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:32,060
Like I can press the little button on my
steering wheel and say Call Eddie Bravo

2384
02:21:32,120 --> 02:21:35,630
and it'll call. You can, I'll
say tech teddy probably read it.

2385
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:39,190
Will read text to you to read text.
See if you have apple carplay. Yup.

2386
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:43,900
But then the problem is if
you started making rechecks,
what does that read? Read?

2387
02:21:46,890 --> 02:21:51,890
Brian said Dick Pic. Yeah.
What'd you like to reply?

2388
02:21:52,580 --> 02:21:57,450
No. Okay. That's kind of cool.
It's kind of weird though. It's,

2389
02:21:57,451 --> 02:22:01,040
it's, it's, they're going to have
something. This is whatever this is.

2390
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:04,850
This is going to be nothing compared
to whatever they settle on 10 years.

2391
02:22:04,851 --> 02:22:08,330
When the fuck are we getting flying cars
that's never going to take it's spine.

2392
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:12,280
Remember your joke about it? Your
bitch. I haven't heard it. It's great.

2393
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:13,680
It's on your new,
you know,

2394
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:18,880
2006 no one or two.

2395
02:22:19,220 --> 02:22:22,310
Nobody else did, but it didn't
get on something. Oh, okay.

2396
02:22:22,810 --> 02:22:25,980
I went from 99 to 2005

2397
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,310
there's a lot. There was a long
gap or I didn't film anything.

2398
02:22:29,490 --> 02:22:34,200
That's where that step. It's from 99 to
2005 special. Yeah. Why'd you do that?

2399
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:38,460
Too busy. That was the fear factor.
Gotcha. You weren't grinding with comedy,

2400
02:22:38,480 --> 02:22:42,810
so you know
we're supposed to have those.

2401
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:45,930
I was doing a lot of spots
at the store 30 years ago,

2402
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:50,970
traveling on chips on
chips like 1978 1980 that,

2403
02:22:52,491 --> 02:22:56,820
that um, jet packs back then and
we still haven't mastered yet,

2404
02:22:56,880 --> 02:23:00,460
but they're getting pretty good though.
I have suggest patios. Yes. I have seen,

2405
02:23:01,290 --> 02:23:03,520
yeah, that they're getting
better now. I've seen it.

2406
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:08,490
I saw a guy in the NFL invest half
of his salary in the flying cars.

2407
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:12,150
This was in 2000 throw. No.
Yeah, he's not doing well.

2408
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:17,230
God didn't work out flying cars. Jesus
Christ. Yeah. That's not going to happen.

2409
02:23:19,230 --> 02:23:21,820
I'm going to get ahead of the curve.
Oh,

2410
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:27,120
just something like that. Getting
off the ground, getting approved,

2411
02:23:27,121 --> 02:23:31,270
getting licensed, not dropping out
of the sky. Can we structure 80?

2412
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:35,670
We didn't think, you know, in 2018
we'd still have cars with rubber tires,

2413
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:38,400
engines and basically the same thing.

2414
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:42,900
Some countries are
making gas cars by 2020.

2415
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:46,570
But what the Craig leading is,
what are you saying this? Yeah, no,

2416
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:50,280
they're not going to release the saddle
gas cars. Yeah. Don't make them illegal.

2417
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:54,270
Oh, what about retro cars? Like are you
allowed to keep your car from like 1980?

2418
02:23:54,300 --> 02:23:57,920
I'm not sure. China, China
in one year decided that uh,

2419
02:23:57,940 --> 02:24:02,310
their air was terrible and one year they
basically said that you're going to use

2420
02:24:02,311 --> 02:24:06,570
natural gas instead of like a coal
and stuff like that in your home.

2421
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:10,620
And, uh, I think it was what it was trying
to have the advantage of just going,

2422
02:24:10,621 --> 02:24:14,730
hey, all you billion plus people no more.
And they changed it in a fucking year.

2423
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:18,150
They just literally just
change the infrastructure
so that they'll be the first

2424
02:24:18,151 --> 02:24:22,970
ones because they don't think electric.
All of China. Yeah, look that up.

2425
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:28,010
We still have coal plants and shit. Well
they do but, but people were using, uh,

2426
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:33,200
things like coal and gas
are fuel to cook their food,

2427
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:39,360
to heat their homes and, and basically
the president said, Nah, natural gas,

2428
02:24:39,361 --> 02:24:42,330
clean burning gas.
No more changed it in a year.

2429
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,690
There is a lot better because
the area was pretty bad,

2430
02:24:45,691 --> 02:24:48,240
but they said the air
was the worst in Beijing.

2431
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:52,380
One thing about UC in Beijing is
nothing but unfinished buildings.

2432
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:57,670
They'll build 20 of the same exact
looking building in one area and it's so

2433
02:24:58,261 --> 02:24:58,561
ugly.

2434
02:24:58,561 --> 02:25:03,561
These giant buildings and that's the
landscape and they're empty or just cranes

2435
02:25:03,961 --> 02:25:07,170
and they're not working. They
overbuilt a lot. Why'd they do that?

2436
02:25:07,470 --> 02:25:08,490
They have ghost cities.

2437
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:11,490
They have huge cities where nobody lives
in them because they were essentially

2438
02:25:11,491 --> 02:25:13,980
saying,
let's just build as many cities as we can,

2439
02:25:13,981 --> 02:25:17,940
but they didn't have the population to
move them in or the or the economy to

2440
02:25:17,941 --> 02:25:22,770
support that city. It's like North
Korea to have a bunch of empty created.

2441
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:24,281
Is that a,

2442
02:25:24,281 --> 02:25:28,150
all somebody has to take a product
of communism versus capitalism cause

2443
02:25:28,151 --> 02:25:32,520
capitalism, they would have had to
have some sort of financial plans. Yes.

2444
02:25:32,580 --> 02:25:36,490
It's a command. It's a command economy.
Right, so, so why not just create jobs,

2445
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:40,930
create jobs. If everybody's working,
just build a bunch of buildings.

2446
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:42,640
Nobody has to live in them,

2447
02:25:42,641 --> 02:25:46,840
but just as long as we got people going
in downtown La, it's kind of like that.

2448
02:25:46,841 --> 02:25:51,841
They're building that new skyscrapers
all the Goddamn time for selling the shit

2449
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:54,040
out of them. Yeah. That's the difference.

2450
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:57,400
A marketplace dictates you have dealt
with developers to take huge risks and

2451
02:25:57,401 --> 02:26:01,690
they say, I'm going to build this in the
hopes that I can fill that retail space,

2452
02:26:01,691 --> 02:26:05,380
office space. China, Ned does
not the same pressures. You know,

2453
02:26:05,381 --> 02:26:08,560
China's an economy of influence to a
lot of times you're not doing business

2454
02:26:08,561 --> 02:26:12,910
unless you've got, you know, connections
with the people that okay, your permits,

2455
02:26:12,911 --> 02:26:16,720
et Cetera.
I mean fuck was so lucky.

2456
02:26:16,721 --> 02:26:19,510
We don't live in a dictatorship like that.

2457
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:24,940
Like if you're stuck under the boot of
something like North Korea and you stuck

2458
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:26,170
and we could,

2459
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:30,820
could've got a shit roll
the dice of course born in
there about an all the time.

2460
02:26:31,300 --> 02:26:34,620
Especially because I lived in those
countries as a kid. Right. You, you, you,

2461
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:36,910
we take a lot of our freedoms for granted,

2462
02:26:36,911 --> 02:26:40,930
but at the same time they're always
under threat. You know, I think from,

2463
02:26:40,931 --> 02:26:45,931
from companies like the fact that so much
information is it's concentrated in so

2464
02:26:46,241 --> 02:26:50,300
few companies like Facebook,
like Google, I worried they have,

2465
02:26:51,580 --> 02:26:54,850
yes, they have critical. That's the real
issue. The real issue is that they have,

2466
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:59,940
they lean politically and they almost
should be completely neutral and just

2467
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:05,590
allow or not allow things based on
whether or not it violates the rules.

2468
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:08,260
But that's not really the
case. No. And also the way,

2469
02:27:08,380 --> 02:27:13,240
the way campaign finance works,
like the way you have to have money,

2470
02:27:13,360 --> 02:27:17,230
it's changing a little, but if you
don't have money as a politician,

2471
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:21,970
you better say what your financing to
the people that are financing and commit

2472
02:27:21,971 --> 02:27:24,670
campaign. They'll tell you, they'll
give you a sheet on what to say.

2473
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:27,540
If you don't do that, you're
not in Congress. The next
time you were out you, you,

2474
02:27:27,541 --> 02:27:28,420
you know you,
you,

2475
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:32,290
you have to listen to the people that
put you there and that's a problem.

2476
02:27:32,810 --> 02:27:36,000
It costs a lot of money to get elected.
It's just you.

2477
02:27:36,001 --> 02:27:41,001
You've got to have very clear rules if
you're going to have rules in terms of

2478
02:27:41,171 --> 02:27:42,610
like what you can and can't say.

2479
02:27:42,611 --> 02:27:47,050
They have to apply to everyone
regardless of race, regardless of gender,

2480
02:27:47,051 --> 02:27:49,390
ethnicity,
and they don't like,

2481
02:27:49,391 --> 02:27:52,720
one of the things that Bret Weinstein
tweeted the other day that I retweeted was

2482
02:27:52,721 --> 02:27:57,550
some woman who, who wrote all white people
are racist and she just went on this,

2483
02:27:57,640 --> 02:28:02,260
this anti white screed. Like you
just can't say that. That's dumb.

2484
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:05,080
That's a dumb generalization.
And it's racist.

2485
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:07,990
And you don't think it's racist because
it's racist against white people,

2486
02:28:07,991 --> 02:28:11,710
but it's racist.
It's so stupid that you allow that,

2487
02:28:11,860 --> 02:28:13,990
but you don't allow racism
against other races.

2488
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:16,600
What's funny is that they're
thinking the same way.

2489
02:28:16,601 --> 02:28:20,360
Their methodology is the same as the
people they're criticizing. Yeah.

2490
02:28:20,361 --> 02:28:22,430
Susan has cracked ribs.
Is that what you think?

2491
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:24,530
It's how you think that makes
it more of a difference. Right.

2492
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:26,540
So you're thinking like a racist.

2493
02:28:26,541 --> 02:28:30,470
I know that you have a different kind
of racism, but it's still racist. Well,

2494
02:28:30,471 --> 02:28:35,270
they think it's justified their shitty
way of doing the math. Yeah, it's not,

2495
02:28:35,271 --> 02:28:38,440
they're not that smart. That's the
other thing is that one's about,

2496
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:42,310
it's been sitting there for three
hours. It's coffee, but the,

2497
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:46,410
but the way you get elected, stay
elected as you, you tow the Utah though.

2498
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:48,140
Like if you're,

2499
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:52,580
if you want to have sort of Anti Wall
Street legislation, certain things.

2500
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:56,390
So swipe fees, swipe fees
on your ATM, that was,

2501
02:28:56,391 --> 02:29:00,620
that's a huge issue and it doesn't
affect a lot of us, but it affects, uh,

2502
02:29:00,621 --> 02:29:05,000
corporations, a bank's bottom
line. And that becomes, you better.

2503
02:29:05,030 --> 02:29:07,850
You better vote favorably or you're
going to, you're going to have a problem.

2504
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:11,660
But I think more and more Americans are
realizing that money in politics is a

2505
02:29:11,661 --> 02:29:16,070
big problem. It is just how the fuck
would you ever get it out? I Dunno.

2506
02:29:16,460 --> 02:29:20,120
It's always been that way. The question
is, does your government represent you?

2507
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:25,000
Right, right. So gerrymandering
and how campaigns are financed,

2508
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:26,150
drives me nuts out quiet.

2509
02:29:26,151 --> 02:29:28,700
Eddie is turn all I'm thinking
about distinguished gentlemen.

2510
02:29:28,701 --> 02:29:31,700
Remember Eddie Murphy when
he became a politician?

2511
02:29:32,440 --> 02:29:35,480
I don't remember that one is
old school man. I see that one.

2512
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:38,120
I might not have said that might be the
one that I've never said he wanted to be

2513
02:29:38,121 --> 02:29:40,180
a politician because they
found out the damn that's,

2514
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:44,330
that's where you make the money. So he,
well you man, Tony Latex, just like,

2515
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:47,360
you know, just taking bribes and all
that shit. But then he gets a conscience.

2516
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:49,250
He does the right thing at the end.

2517
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:54,250
But a congressmen spans a US congressman
spends between 30 and 70% of his time

2518
02:29:54,291 --> 02:29:58,370
or her time on the phone to people they
don't know, trying to raise money. Okay,

2519
02:29:58,371 --> 02:30:00,830
so and you're not allowed to
do it on government property.

2520
02:30:00,831 --> 02:30:04,130
So what you do is you go across the
street, you're sitting in your car,

2521
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:05,690
you can go across to you in the capital,

2522
02:30:05,691 --> 02:30:07,880
they're in their car and
they're making phone calls,

2523
02:30:07,881 --> 02:30:12,110
they're given a list and you make a phone
call and you spend 30 to 70% of your

2524
02:30:12,111 --> 02:30:15,860
time doing that to raise money.
There's something wrong with that.

2525
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:18,450
That's kind of fucked up,
but it's, you got to do that.

2526
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:20,780
Whenever I hear people talk
too much about politics,

2527
02:30:20,781 --> 02:30:23,150
even myself included my own words,
I'm like,

2528
02:30:23,151 --> 02:30:25,670
you're talking about like a rigged game.
It's like you're,

2529
02:30:25,850 --> 02:30:27,560
it's like you're talking
about pro wrestling.

2530
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:31,520
It's like you're talking about something
that's you pretending that it's real,

2531
02:30:31,910 --> 02:30:33,860
but you know what you know,
you know,

2532
02:30:34,190 --> 02:30:37,430
of course the government
is corrupt as fuck,

2533
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:39,650
but when you're talking
about stuff like that,

2534
02:30:39,651 --> 02:30:44,420
like it are the election's
rigged or do our votes count?

2535
02:30:44,600 --> 02:30:46,460
The one thing that I learned from this,
this,

2536
02:30:46,490 --> 02:30:51,490
these midterms is that if your vote
didn't count and it was an and a,

2537
02:30:51,691 --> 02:30:53,480
it's all decided like pro wrestling.

2538
02:30:53,960 --> 02:30:57,530
Then there wouldn't be all this voter
fraud and all these computers that can,

2539
02:30:57,700 --> 02:31:01,160
you know, I'm talking to them. I'm not
sure I'm going to have to get a boat.

2540
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:05,080
I'm talking about the way once you're in
office, the way things get. Nothing. No,

2541
02:31:05,081 --> 02:31:09,860
no, no. I get it. But what I'm saying
is from, from uh, the elections,

2542
02:31:09,861 --> 02:31:12,290
you see that your vote's do matter.

2543
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:16,580
There's a lot of corruption and fraud
going on. But if it was all rigged,

2544
02:31:16,581 --> 02:31:21,410
like WWE, they wouldn't need to
do all that was, you're right.

2545
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:25,400
So it's still, it's still
the real system, right?

2546
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:28,110
Because a lot of people think it's not
a real system. Like it doesn't matter.

2547
02:31:28,111 --> 02:31:30,720
They already decided and they're just
going to put them in. No. The way they,

2548
02:31:30,810 --> 02:31:31,890
they actually decide is,

2549
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:35,120
is they decide who they're
going to rig the machines for,

2550
02:31:35,610 --> 02:31:39,790
but the vote still counts. You just got to
make sure that there's no, uh, you know,

2551
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:43,410
shenanigans going on votes. Right.
Certainly do count. But what would,

2552
02:31:43,470 --> 02:31:46,920
where it gets really squirrely, and
this is where politics get goofy, is in,

2553
02:31:46,921 --> 02:31:49,200
why do politicians do what they do?

2554
02:31:49,350 --> 02:31:52,890
Do they do what they do to support
the people or do they do what they do?

2555
02:31:52,891 --> 02:31:56,790
Because special interest groups of
infant to way more. But not only that,

2556
02:31:56,820 --> 02:32:00,270
here's what's really, wow. So, so
Capitol Hill, when you're in Congress,

2557
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:04,320
they call that the farm team. Because
in cabinet, hell, you spent six years,

2558
02:32:04,350 --> 02:32:08,640
seven years, let's just say, or a senator.
Now, when you're a senator for, I dunno,

2559
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:13,110
10 years, when you're on capital hill for
as a congressman for six, for 10 years,

2560
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:18,060
you develop real connections
and relationships with
government officials who

2561
02:32:18,061 --> 02:32:21,150
make decisions.
You also understand how government works.

2562
02:32:21,151 --> 02:32:24,480
You understand who's actually
influencing who. So now what do you do?

2563
02:32:24,630 --> 02:32:27,480
So let's say you lose an election,
or let's say you decide,

2564
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:31,320
I bet I made my hundred and 60 grand a
year, can't really live on that money.

2565
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,580
You go to k street,
you join a lobbying firm and,

2566
02:32:36,680 --> 02:32:39,750
and because you've been there
for six or nine or 10 years,

2567
02:32:40,020 --> 02:32:43,650
you know a lot of people and
that lobbying farm goes, hey,

2568
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:46,020
we'll pay $1 million now.

2569
02:32:46,110 --> 02:32:49,140
And all you gotta do is drive
to Capitol Hill every day.

2570
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:53,940
Get in there and influence,
use your connections so that we,

2571
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:56,430
we can get what we want from government.

2572
02:32:56,431 --> 02:33:01,260
So corporations hiring lobbying
firms to lobby for their bottom line.

2573
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:04,350
So now you're working
to influence government.

2574
02:33:04,351 --> 02:33:06,990
And the problem is when you're
in Congress, you know that,

2575
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:08,880
you know you have a job waiting.

2576
02:33:08,881 --> 02:33:13,560
If you can make great connections and
now Washington becomes an economy of

2577
02:33:13,561 --> 02:33:16,470
influence. That's the game,
right? Yes. I'm fucking,

2578
02:33:16,471 --> 02:33:19,890
you gotta have a Lawrence Lessig on
your Goddamn podcast. He can explain it.

2579
02:33:19,891 --> 02:33:22,740
He's a Harvard professor
and that motherfucker keep
telling me about the podcast

2580
02:33:22,741 --> 02:33:26,580
you did with him. He'll break it
down. I did. Yeah. Listen to that.

2581
02:33:26,581 --> 02:33:29,880
I'll say I sent it to you. I think
it's Lawrence Lessig. He's, he's,

2582
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:31,230
he breaks it down.

2583
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:34,500
He wrote a book called Republic lost
and he's got a couple of Ted talks.

2584
02:33:34,500 --> 02:33:35,940
But that dude,
yes.

2585
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And basically he said your government
doesn't represent you and here's why.

2586
02:33:41,370 --> 02:33:43,320
Here's how it works.
When he breaks it down and you go,

2587
02:33:44,050 --> 02:33:47,360
it's simple the way he breaks it down
cause he's a constitutional scholar at

2588
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:50,970
Harvard and you're like, fuck it, the
kid. And what he said was fascinating.

2589
02:33:50,971 --> 02:33:54,510
He said, Washington's a place
where even if you're a good person,

2590
02:33:55,500 --> 02:33:58,230
you must behave in a corrupt
manner if you want to survive.

2591
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:00,870
And that's when you have problems
when good people have to behave.

2592
02:34:00,871 --> 02:34:02,220
Corruptly yeah,
yeah.

2593
02:34:02,230 --> 02:34:06,550
The bright side of all of that then
fed the bright side of all that is uh,

2594
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:11,600
the fact that there is like people
getting suicided and bribery going on,

2595
02:34:11,850 --> 02:34:13,260
that that means that there's hope,

2596
02:34:13,261 --> 02:34:17,090
that there's good people inside the
government that you got to watch you gotta

2597
02:34:17,350 --> 02:34:18,920
your ass. You know, we're going to have,

2598
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:21,820
we got to hire someone to kill you
because we don't want to go to jail.

2599
02:34:21,910 --> 02:34:24,850
So the fact that all that's down it
kill you, they can just get you out.

2600
02:34:25,170 --> 02:34:30,170
Or what I'm saying is the fact that
there is all that bribery and suiciding,

2601
02:34:30,670 --> 02:34:35,380
that means that there's good people
in there that are, are going after,

2602
02:34:35,510 --> 02:34:39,660
uh, the bad people. But to
me, I look at the bright side.

2603
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:42,820
I used to think there was no hope.
I used to think fuck am like when,

2604
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,960
when the bushes were an office,
Clinton, Obama, I was like,

2605
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:50,860
I didn't pay attention to shit.
I just said they're all corrupt.

2606
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:54,080
It's all rigged and it's all, you know,
there's nothing you could do about it.

2607
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:57,160
But um, you know, over the
last couple of years, you know,

2608
02:34:57,161 --> 02:35:00,480
since Trump got into office now
I'm like paying attention. My,

2609
02:35:00,580 --> 02:35:03,940
there are some good people trying to
do some good shit. Like Trey Gowdy.

2610
02:35:04,300 --> 02:35:07,210
Listen to that motherfucker.
Trey Gowdy is a bad motherfucker.

2611
02:35:07,270 --> 02:35:12,060
What are you talking about? Gates? No
politician with the congressmen. Oh Man.

2612
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:14,830
They're great people going
after the bad people.

2613
02:35:14,831 --> 02:35:18,460
That's why there needs to be
bribes and suiciding and blackmail.

2614
02:35:18,580 --> 02:35:20,770
The reason there's black males,
because there's good people in there.

2615
02:35:20,771 --> 02:35:23,520
If everybody was bad, they would.
Why would you blackmail any,

2616
02:35:23,630 --> 02:35:25,810
the problem is it's really subtle
the way they can get you out though.

2617
02:35:25,811 --> 02:35:29,590
Because when your donors are
telling you which way to vote,

2618
02:35:29,630 --> 02:35:32,680
you're you as a politician going there
with all your ideas and you can't vote

2619
02:35:32,681 --> 02:35:35,620
your conscience. There's a lineup
and she got a lot of bad shit.

2620
02:35:35,650 --> 02:35:39,500
You've got to show the money. You're
preaching to the choir over here. I'm not,

2621
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:43,030
I'm not going to defend. So you fix
that. So, so Lawrence Lessig has,

2622
02:35:43,031 --> 02:35:46,660
one of the ideas he talks about
is anonymous donations. So,

2623
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:50,080
so watch your a politician.
I'm a corporation.

2624
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:54,460
I give your a or an eye through a
super PAC or whatever it might be.

2625
02:35:54,461 --> 02:35:59,020
I give your campaign a lot of money.
Now you're a regular dude.

2626
02:35:59,021 --> 02:36:01,060
You're not corrupt.
But human beings,

2627
02:36:01,061 --> 02:36:03,910
when somebody gives them a
real hand when they needed it,

2628
02:36:04,210 --> 02:36:08,050
you can't help but to feel a little
indebted. Of course. What if all,

2629
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:09,760
what if there are two ideas?

2630
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:13,420
What if you add a voucher system with
all of us were given a certain amount of

2631
02:36:13,421 --> 02:36:17,980
money every election cycle and we were
allowed to anonymously to give that money

2632
02:36:17,981 --> 02:36:21,850
to whoever we thought was a viable
candidate. It'd be anonymous.

2633
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:26,650
Or what if all donations were anonymous?
What if you didn't,

2634
02:36:26,680 --> 02:36:28,390
if you couldn't say who it was from,

2635
02:36:28,750 --> 02:36:31,720
but if you know you've got a lot of stuff
from GE or you know you've got a lot

2636
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:36,700
of stuff from Lockheed and there's a bill
that comes up for Saudi Arabia to buy

2637
02:36:36,701 --> 02:36:39,250
a bunch of tanks or
whatever or or weaponry,

2638
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:42,520
it's going to be very hard for you
to vote against that. And if you do,

2639
02:36:42,521 --> 02:36:44,830
those people that got you in power
last time aren't going to get you.

2640
02:36:44,831 --> 02:36:47,260
Empower the, basically figured
out a way to make bribing legal.

2641
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:49,280
This is just the way it works,
Bro.

2642
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:51,850
Take care of you and you
add money to your campaign,

2643
02:36:51,851 --> 02:36:54,710
but then don't exactly tell you
what to do, right? But you know,

2644
02:36:54,940 --> 02:36:59,710
read the book to read is republic lost
fucking good because it on the audio. Yes.

2645
02:36:59,711 --> 02:37:00,670
It's amazing.
And get,

2646
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:03,910
get Lawrence Lessig on your God damn
podcast to break it down. All right,

2647
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:04,763
let's do it relaxed.

2648
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:08,560
I get excited about it because when you
say campaign finance reform is so boring,

2649
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:12,100
right? Did I hear that? I go like this.
Ooh, I've had a book, two books on it.

2650
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:15,770
I'm like, oh darn, I get bored. I get
tired right away. But it's so important.

2651
02:37:17,510 --> 02:37:21,320
They've got to figure out some way
to stop these giant corporations from

2652
02:37:21,321 --> 02:37:25,220
influencing politicians. They've got to
find some way it's gotta become illegal,

2653
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:30,680
influenced your money shows and everybody,

2654
02:37:30,710 --> 02:37:34,100
there's money to be made no matter
what the idea is that they want.

2655
02:37:34,101 --> 02:37:37,160
So much so that anything
that threatens that money,

2656
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:41,330
the real true marketplace they want, they
want to put the fucking brakes to that.

2657
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:44,300
But you still have a kid supposed
to cancel each other out though. So,

2658
02:37:44,301 --> 02:37:47,510
so ideally it's nothing wrong with
petition your government that's in the

2659
02:37:47,511 --> 02:37:49,130
constitution.
So you can lobby your government,

2660
02:37:49,131 --> 02:37:50,330
it's called petitioning your guide,

2661
02:37:50,360 --> 02:37:54,610
but her laptop donating money to
your campaign. That's where it,

2662
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:59,570
that's where citizens United comes. Isn't
lobbying illegal in some countries? Uh,

2663
02:37:59,571 --> 02:38:01,630
probably the problem with lobbying,

2664
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:06,680
so says boy countries and legal
and I think maybe a Holland.

2665
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:10,700
I think so. I think lobbying
cause that's what a, but lobbying,

2666
02:38:10,730 --> 02:38:14,360
the with making lobbying illegal is,
it's part of free speech.

2667
02:38:14,870 --> 02:38:17,510
That's what it was ruled in the
Supreme Court. So citizens United.

2668
02:38:17,600 --> 02:38:20,450
So in other words,
if I want to give money to you,

2669
02:38:20,451 --> 02:38:23,720
you're a politician and you and I want to,
I want Eddie Bravo to be president,

2670
02:38:23,721 --> 02:38:28,580
right? I should be able to exercise
my right as a citizen and support you,

2671
02:38:29,090 --> 02:38:32,690
which means you want. So I want to amplify
your voice. That means you need money.

2672
02:38:32,870 --> 02:38:36,350
So to tell me I can't give money to the
person I like is a restriction of free

2673
02:38:36,351 --> 02:38:37,820
speech.
And that I think is,

2674
02:38:37,980 --> 02:38:41,090
I think that was the citizens
United Supreme Court knows
there's another problem.

2675
02:38:41,120 --> 02:38:44,330
The other problem is when
subjects like this get brought up,

2676
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:48,020
and this is one of the most important
subjects that we could ever discuss,

2677
02:38:48,021 --> 02:38:52,010
like how our world gets run. I get bored
as fuck. I know you get bored as fuck.

2678
02:38:52,100 --> 02:38:55,770
He turns out, I've been starting up
the wall for the last 30 minutes.

2679
02:38:56,420 --> 02:39:00,380
I understand it's you don't want to have,
you don't want to have to play.

2680
02:39:00,381 --> 02:39:05,300
It affects all of us. Do you want to be
like these I'm leaves over here dude.

2681
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:10,330
You going to do so into politics ever?
I'ms depo changes.

2682
02:39:10,430 --> 02:39:13,130
I love it. It's like game of Thrones, but
it's for real and it affects your life.

2683
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:14,180
It does affect your life.

2684
02:39:14,770 --> 02:39:19,700
Real Shit is real game of Thrones going
on right now and it's so entertaining to

2685
02:39:19,701 --> 02:39:23,840
find out what the fuck instead of watching
it Goddamn TV show that does nothing

2686
02:39:23,841 --> 02:39:24,770
for your life you're at.

2687
02:39:24,830 --> 02:39:27,650
It's really like game of Thrones
really going on right now.

2688
02:39:27,790 --> 02:39:29,390
If they pay attention,
attendance problem with John,

2689
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:34,250
season hundred and 11 watched TV
shows so that I could just have fun.

2690
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:36,770
Yeah. I'm not saying don't do
that. I'm not saying don't do that,

2691
02:39:36,771 --> 02:39:40,130
but I don't think you can do both.
Those things freak me the fuck out.

2692
02:39:40,131 --> 02:39:41,900
And you can do both.
You can do both.

2693
02:39:41,901 --> 02:39:44,750
But if you really start paying attention
too much to politics and I have a bunch

2694
02:39:44,751 --> 02:39:48,410
of friends that are really into policy,
especially right now, and they could talk,

2695
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:52,040
let me ask all of you this.
So,

2696
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:55,310
so as far as like not standing
out of politics or whatever,

2697
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:57,830
what if this is where it comes down to?
We off kids here,

2698
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:03,260
so now there is a legislative agenda,
whatever it might be,

2699
02:40:03,740 --> 02:40:05,810
and it's an agenda that says we want to,

2700
02:40:05,811 --> 02:40:10,040
we want to teach your kids something
like let's just say because the social

2701
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:12,920
scientists and academia wins their way.
It gets into the air.

2702
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:16,890
Politicians was happens all the time
and politicians say all schools,

2703
02:40:17,070 --> 02:40:21,420
public schools at least where my kids go
are going to teach that there's a zero

2704
02:40:21,421 --> 02:40:24,660
biological difference or zero
difference between men and women.

2705
02:40:24,810 --> 02:40:25,830
Oh and by the way,

2706
02:40:26,040 --> 02:40:30,630
ready evolution is a theory and we're
going to put it on the same standings as

2707
02:40:30,631 --> 02:40:31,790
creationists theory too.

2708
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:36,660
I eat school board in Kansas I think
at one point and had that going on.

2709
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:41,400
There are the frame each saying
the same people that say,

2710
02:40:41,490 --> 02:40:45,390
I'm just saying what happens?
What happens if you, if you,

2711
02:40:45,391 --> 02:40:47,370
if you stay out of this
debate and the wrong people,

2712
02:40:47,371 --> 02:40:51,030
when they push their ideas forward,
which usually have a political agenda,

2713
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:54,900
you might be faced with a situation where
somebody is trying to educate your kid,

2714
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:59,950
kid in things that you just not only
disagree with factually incorrect so that

2715
02:41:01,561 --> 02:41:04,320
this happens. This is where it
starts getting personal. Yeah.

2716
02:41:04,350 --> 02:41:07,500
It can get real weird. Like there was
this thing from nature of the other day

2717
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:08,190
that,
uh,

2718
02:41:08,190 --> 02:41:13,190
I retweeted cause Bret
Weinstein Weinstein had,

2719
02:41:13,231 --> 02:41:16,020
uh,
brought it up and it was like,

2720
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:20,700
this is really disturbing that these
people were making this distinction.

2721
02:41:20,890 --> 02:41:25,710
It was talking about the difference
between biological sex and uh, and real,

2722
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:29,490
I don't want to misquote it,
so I'll find out the exact thing.

2723
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:34,760
But there's essentially promoting social
justice principles over scientific

2724
02:41:35,671 --> 02:41:40,530
principles. And it's supposed to be a
company that specializes in science,

2725
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:43,470
right?
So instead of just being scientific,

2726
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:48,500
there's scientific with a very clear
progressive political twist to it.

2727
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:51,590
And you're like, well, just
because something's in convenient,

2728
02:41:51,610 --> 02:41:53,370
it doesn't mean it's incorrect.

2729
02:41:53,430 --> 02:41:57,540
Just because something's uncomfortable
doesn't mean it's not true. Right?

2730
02:41:57,541 --> 02:42:00,870
And there's things that you might have
your own personal beliefs and values and

2731
02:42:00,871 --> 02:42:03,870
ethics, but that's not what we're counting
on. When you're a science journal,

2732
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:08,010
we're counting on just facts. That's
it. And they're not doing that.

2733
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:08,873
Did you see the,

2734
02:42:08,880 --> 02:42:13,320
I think I sent you guys are to thing to
say this proposal has no foundation in

2735
02:42:13,321 --> 02:42:17,640
science is nonsense. The genitals. So
this is what it is. Like go to the pit,

2736
02:42:17,641 --> 02:42:21,180
pull up the nature one first.
I could read that the u s editorial,

2737
02:42:21,181 --> 02:42:24,810
the u s department of Health and human
services proposes to establish a legal

2738
02:42:24,811 --> 02:42:28,620
definition of whether someone is male
or female based on the genitals they are

2739
02:42:28,621 --> 02:42:29,454
born with.

2740
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:34,320
This proposal has no foundation in
science and should be abandoned.

2741
02:42:34,321 --> 02:42:35,970
And this is the journal Nature though.

2742
02:42:35,971 --> 02:42:40,971
So the problem with that is what
Bret Weinstein very succinctly says,

2743
02:42:42,151 --> 02:42:46,260
like to say in quotes, this proposal
has no foundation in science,

2744
02:42:46,261 --> 02:42:49,620
which is what they said he
says is nonsense. The genitals.

2745
02:42:49,621 --> 02:42:54,621
One one is born with show overwhelming
correlation with one self assessed gender

2746
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:58,890
as predicted by evolutionary theory.
If we grant nature's claim,

2747
02:42:58,891 --> 02:43:02,430
we condemn the study of
complex phenomena to a dark.

2748
02:43:02,670 --> 02:43:07,270
There you go and there's the
class. Exactly. Sample and
nature should know better,

2749
02:43:07,271 --> 02:43:09,550
but they have a political agenda.
Where'd that come from?

2750
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:14,380
They were influenced by forces
probably on the radical left in this.

2751
02:43:14,381 --> 02:43:16,990
In this instance, there are other
sports is on the other side.

2752
02:43:17,020 --> 02:43:19,270
That's where the wind is
going and if you support that,

2753
02:43:19,271 --> 02:43:22,180
you get way more love than you get
hate, right? There's currency to it.

2754
02:43:22,181 --> 02:43:26,500
You've lived finger you as prestige where
the wind's going to say that there's

2755
02:43:26,501 --> 02:43:30,730
no correlation is fucking bananas
were all men and that's controversial.

2756
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:33,130
It's controversial to say it well.

2757
02:43:33,131 --> 02:43:36,040
It's just a lot of nonsense going on
right now that I think will eventually be

2758
02:43:36,041 --> 02:43:40,050
sorted out once the dust settles, but I
think this is just a wave of information.

2759
02:43:40,060 --> 02:43:41,590
It goes left,
it goes right.

2760
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:44,830
Everybody's battling it out and because
people are more concerned with their

2761
02:43:44,831 --> 02:43:46,840
side winning than they
are with actual facts.

2762
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:51,460
A lot of really stupid ideas get supported
and instead of objectively analyzed

2763
02:43:51,461 --> 02:43:54,580
for whether or not they contain Tris,
push back with kids though. So my buddy,

2764
02:43:54,880 --> 02:43:59,850
my buddy's son is 15 and he was like,
it's all about gender and,

2765
02:43:59,851 --> 02:44:00,550
and you know,

2766
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:03,780
educating you on gender and high
school people choose their pronouns.

2767
02:44:03,781 --> 02:44:05,140
So when you're in college,

2768
02:44:05,530 --> 02:44:09,160
my nephew who was in college where I
dealt with 18 years old, they said,

2769
02:44:09,350 --> 02:44:10,440
I'd say your name and,

2770
02:44:10,441 --> 02:44:15,010
and please tell us what pronoun you
would like to be referred to class. Yes.

2771
02:44:15,011 --> 02:44:19,600
Right. At first, first day or so.
So now the kids, now the kids,

2772
02:44:19,601 --> 02:44:23,080
now the kids though, as they're being
taught this by their fucking teachers,

2773
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:26,980
cause they're kids, they're like the
fuck out of here. So my friend goes,

2774
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:30,550
look at that and look at,
look at butterflies and the
beautiful and his son goes,

2775
02:44:30,551 --> 02:44:34,930
Dad, do you have any idea how
hurtful it is that butterfly,

2776
02:44:34,931 --> 02:44:37,150
you have no idea what that
butterflies gender is.

2777
02:44:37,390 --> 02:44:40,630
And they're all fucking around now.
So if there's push back on that shit,

2778
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:43,690
well you know, you can't get
to create some pushback kids.

2779
02:44:43,850 --> 02:44:48,850
So some cause we can see there's some
really influenced people easily influenced

2780
02:44:48,971 --> 02:44:51,310
people that are adopting
all the stars. Wait, yours.

2781
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:54,170
So than it was when we were growing. Of
course, even if there's, especially in La,

2782
02:44:54,390 --> 02:44:59,290
indoctrination is the right word.
You can get kids to believe in anything.

2783
02:44:59,470 --> 02:45:02,560
I use some MK Ultra and my son
too. I said, you know what?

2784
02:45:02,561 --> 02:45:05,410
I'm going to make him a Cleveland
browns fan. We flew to Cleveland,

2785
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:09,400
the Cleveland browns and all he
wanted was a baker, Mayfield Jersey.

2786
02:45:09,401 --> 02:45:12,730
That's the one be like, Dad, I'm like
fucking work once and be like, like dead.

2787
02:45:12,760 --> 02:45:14,450
But that's what he likes.
But that's what happens.

2788
02:45:14,690 --> 02:45:17,050
You got into Cleveland browns on one trip.
He's,

2789
02:45:18,280 --> 02:45:23,280
it's hard though to keep a theory going
that doesn't really have any basis in

2790
02:45:24,461 --> 02:45:27,280
science. At the end of the day it's,
it's kind of banking a physical.

2791
02:45:27,281 --> 02:45:29,890
I don't think they're very smart time.
I think their political now,

2792
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:31,840
I don't think they're very smart and
I don't think there's scholarship.

2793
02:45:32,490 --> 02:45:36,670
There's this deep men,
women people born as men,

2794
02:45:36,730 --> 02:45:39,200
but think they're women. People
born as women, cattleman,

2795
02:45:40,030 --> 02:45:43,240
people that think they're both, that's
five. It's very rare. What else?

2796
02:45:43,630 --> 02:45:46,960
They said there's like 60 of them
are 78 different gender pronouns,

2797
02:45:46,961 --> 02:45:50,440
but that's because no one has agreed
on what the gender Pronoun should be.

2798
02:45:50,441 --> 02:45:54,430
So if you decide that yours is
I are and I said, no, mine is z.

2799
02:45:54,431 --> 02:45:59,380
Y. R. E like to explain,

2800
02:45:59,410 --> 02:46:04,180
it's an obsession. What it is, there's,
there are people that want to be special.

2801
02:46:04,181 --> 02:46:07,020
This is a big part in whatever you got
to go to. He's going to be Spanish.

2802
02:46:07,040 --> 02:46:09,950
If you're a guy, come on.
What do you got? Take courses.

2803
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:13,160
I know you think you're a guy. You know
what? I know you think you're a guy,

2804
02:46:13,161 --> 02:46:15,860
but we're going to, you're going
to, you know what? For sure.

2805
02:46:16,310 --> 02:46:17,630
Harris said that I fucking loved.

2806
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:22,660
He said right now the one thing to keep
in mind is that being offended is not an

2807
02:46:24,111 --> 02:46:25,790
argument and it's not a virtue.

2808
02:46:26,350 --> 02:46:31,350
So you can't just shut the conversation
down because you're offended and you're

2809
02:46:31,701 --> 02:46:33,440
taking issue with what I say.

2810
02:46:33,620 --> 02:46:36,560
That ain't an argument and it
sure as fuck ain't a virtue,

2811
02:46:36,770 --> 02:46:40,430
but that's what's going on. When, what's
her name? Heather Mcdonald's at her name.

2812
02:46:40,431 --> 02:46:44,600
She was speaking at a, she was speaking
at a college and there was a law student.

2813
02:46:44,630 --> 02:46:48,020
He was just giving you the finger the
whole time and all she was trying to do is

2814
02:46:48,021 --> 02:46:51,650
talk about, you know, something that was
based in science and Heather MacDonald.

2815
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:55,660
What's her name? No, she's a,
she's a professor at journalists,

2816
02:46:55,661 --> 02:46:58,250
a professor of journalism I think.
And uh,

2817
02:46:58,310 --> 02:47:01,610
she's a very reasonable kind of like
clear, I can't remember matter man.

2818
02:47:01,611 --> 02:47:06,020
People are struggling so hard to find
things to be offended at that they're

2819
02:47:06,050 --> 02:47:08,800
pointing at targets that
aren't viable and the,

2820
02:47:08,980 --> 02:47:11,390
they're throwing all their weight into
it and then when it doesn't work they

2821
02:47:11,391 --> 02:47:14,730
back out and they try someone new. That's
right. You know, Christina Hoff summers,

2822
02:47:14,731 --> 02:47:17,870
you were some of the things that she did
where she was trying to speak and they

2823
02:47:17,871 --> 02:47:22,010
were shouting or going and making all
this noise in the crowd trying to bu or

2824
02:47:22,011 --> 02:47:26,810
off the stage. They try to silence people
because it's something that you can do.

2825
02:47:26,930 --> 02:47:29,090
You can get it done because
they're afraid of their ideas.

2826
02:47:29,091 --> 02:47:32,720
They don't think they're [inaudible]
committee game man. It's a game.

2827
02:47:33,050 --> 02:47:36,530
They're on one side, she's in the
other, it's a road for the browns.

2828
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:40,770
She's with the Raiders, right? That's
what it is. Teams. It's 100%, which is,

2829
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:43,250
what are your feelings
on the caravan situation?

2830
02:47:43,500 --> 02:47:44,360
What do you guys think about that?

2831
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:47,660
Desperate people from all the people
that are getting in here every day.

2832
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:51,130
Like what is this a full, it's a fake
thing. We're supposed to be painting.

2833
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:52,670
Exactly happened with the Caribbean.

2834
02:47:52,730 --> 02:47:56,390
So they're making a big publicity event
out of these people that want to come to

2835
02:47:56,391 --> 02:47:59,240
America. They came from, they want asylum,

2836
02:47:59,241 --> 02:48:03,810
but they came from
[inaudible], [inaudible] and
this other gang are the big

2837
02:48:03,811 --> 02:48:06,890
employers there. If you don't join them,
you get your family killed. Nice guys.

2838
02:48:07,310 --> 02:48:09,770
And I think that, uh,
these people are desperate.

2839
02:48:09,810 --> 02:48:13,460
They're essentially refugees from
a place that's intolerable live,

2840
02:48:13,461 --> 02:48:18,140
but they're making it this really big
political deal. It's very publicized,

2841
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:20,360
total.
And apparently then always walking.

2842
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:24,440
Sometimes they get in the vans and
people drive in place and let them in.

2843
02:48:24,890 --> 02:48:26,840
I don't know who you'd say that we
shouldn't let them in or we should,

2844
02:48:26,841 --> 02:48:28,930
we'll load them in. This is what I'm
saying. I'm saying what's the issue?

2845
02:48:29,120 --> 02:48:30,260
Well yeah we definitely don't.

2846
02:48:30,261 --> 02:48:32,240
People don't want them if they're
illegal immigrants. Right.

2847
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:35,900
But what's interesting to me is like if
you come from Cuba, you can just come.

2848
02:48:36,330 --> 02:48:40,130
Yeah. You if you get on a boat
and he get over here in America,

2849
02:48:40,131 --> 02:48:44,570
but like you made it bro. Come on in. If
you tried from Guatemala, Nah, sorry son.

2850
02:48:44,571 --> 02:48:48,980
Ronald Patch at dirt. Find another.
Don't take carpool because as a man,

2851
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:53,270
because it sounds really bad,
but it's, it's fascinating.

2852
02:48:53,271 --> 02:48:58,040
Double murders in New York and there's
really made an agreement that anybody

2853
02:48:58,041 --> 02:49:02,000
who's trying to escape the kind of shitty
situation they have in Cuba will allow

2854
02:49:02,001 --> 02:49:06,080
that. Oh I got you. I got so loud
that Columbia, I mean if you,

2855
02:49:06,081 --> 02:49:10,350
if you're Yoel and you come over
from Cuba. Yes, that's true. Yeah.

2856
02:49:10,380 --> 02:49:12,600
Cause your comments,
we'll take you.

2857
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:16,260
But people think that like all Mexicans
are like for the caravan and to,

2858
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:18,600
you know, we want them,
you know, that's not true.

2859
02:49:19,200 --> 02:49:23,590
Most Mexicans are like immigration
in another country. You,

2860
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:25,500
I ain't getting on welfare.
You know what I mean?

2861
02:49:25,501 --> 02:49:28,500
Mexicans ain't down for that caravan.
They want them turned away too.

2862
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:32,400
It's a complicated emotional
issue, man. It's like,

2863
02:49:32,401 --> 02:49:34,680
I always do this joke
where I believe in borders,

2864
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:36,810
but I'd be a shitty border control agent,
right?

2865
02:49:36,990 --> 02:49:39,560
Like I do think borders are reasonable,
but I have nobody gets over.

2866
02:49:39,580 --> 02:49:42,700
And then I'd be like, oh, the
kids, fuck it. Come on on. Right.

2867
02:49:43,650 --> 02:49:45,750
I think Americans feel that
way at that. You know, it's a,

2868
02:49:45,751 --> 02:49:50,340
it's a hard to live in a gated community.
No. Okay. I mean, yes. All right. No,

2869
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:54,240
it is, it's like the idea
that there's a real country,

2870
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:57,330
that there's a place where you can go in
a place where you can't go and like you

2871
02:49:57,331 --> 02:50:00,360
have to have papers and they make
a cross this line in the dirt,

2872
02:50:00,361 --> 02:50:02,670
like they've set up fences and borders.
Well,

2873
02:50:02,671 --> 02:50:05,970
the surface needs reason
that exists, right? I mean,

2874
02:50:05,971 --> 02:50:07,650
if you think about the United States,
right?

2875
02:50:07,651 --> 02:50:10,350
The United States essentially
is not just a country,

2876
02:50:10,470 --> 02:50:12,840
it's a collection of different areas,
right?

2877
02:50:12,841 --> 02:50:17,010
In each different area has
its own culture, their own
almost their own language.

2878
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:17,401
You know,

2879
02:50:17,401 --> 02:50:20,580
the way they talk and Florida way fucking
different than the way they talk in

2880
02:50:20,581 --> 02:50:23,190
Maine. It's really weird.
It's all the same language,

2881
02:50:23,191 --> 02:50:27,060
but it's almost like they're separate
little countries and we travel amongst

2882
02:50:27,061 --> 02:50:30,320
each other. No problem. And you're
allowed to, you're allowed to bail out of,

2883
02:50:30,321 --> 02:50:31,890
I'm going to try and to Vegas for a while.

2884
02:50:31,891 --> 02:50:34,140
I'm going to get me a job at the casino.
Nobody cares.

2885
02:50:34,490 --> 02:50:36,990
You're fine as long as you're honest,
one patch of dirt.

2886
02:50:37,470 --> 02:50:41,070
But the reason why we don't allow all the
other patches that dirt to do the same

2887
02:50:41,071 --> 02:50:45,960
thing and everybody just flow freely
is because there's some spots that just

2888
02:50:45,961 --> 02:50:49,560
don't have it good at all.
And we want those people to stay there.

2889
02:50:49,770 --> 02:50:53,070
Although you haven't thought,
although your spot you haven't fixed,

2890
02:50:53,100 --> 02:50:54,570
you know what the connected extra spot,

2891
02:50:54,630 --> 02:50:57,510
but you know what the connective
tissue is for Americans besides the,

2892
02:50:57,520 --> 02:50:58,710
even though that's true,

2893
02:50:59,280 --> 02:51:03,270
the connective tissue that I think a lot
of countries don't have is that the one

2894
02:51:03,271 --> 02:51:06,690
thing we have gone for it. Even if it's,
even if it's a myth for a lot of people,

2895
02:51:07,050 --> 02:51:09,120
the one thing all Americans
have gone for him is,

2896
02:51:09,121 --> 02:51:14,121
is now is the idea that there's
a chance if I do the right thing,

2897
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:19,830
I may be poor now American, but I could
be a fucking millionaire. Their control.

2898
02:51:19,831 --> 02:51:23,220
Yeah, for sure and shit is so, and
but that's what keeps the sort of,

2899
02:51:23,250 --> 02:51:26,040
that's what I have coming from
running from creating a revolution.

2900
02:51:26,460 --> 02:51:29,400
But if we lose that, if we let people
start thinking that's not for them.

2901
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:34,560
Let everybody, right, right. You can't,
you can let everybody in from Kentucky.

2902
02:51:34,890 --> 02:51:37,290
If everybody from Kentucky
decided to move to La,

2903
02:51:37,291 --> 02:51:39,600
we would just have to deal with it.
Lots of America, they got citizenship.

2904
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:41,040
That's what I'm saying.
Like,

2905
02:51:41,041 --> 02:51:43,440
it's not the reason why we
can't have world citizens.

2906
02:51:43,450 --> 02:51:47,580
Obs to some places suck too hard.
You don't want to nationalism.

2907
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:50,130
I'm not saying that it's good or bad,

2908
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:53,520
I'm just looking at it as a thing right
now. If I had to say, do I like it?

2909
02:51:54,090 --> 02:51:54,691
Honestly,

2910
02:51:54,691 --> 02:51:59,670
I think the whole world as
the human beings as a race
would be way better off if

2911
02:51:59,671 --> 02:52:02,820
everybody could move where it's good.
And then we would figure out why.

2912
02:52:02,821 --> 02:52:05,740
There's too many people where it's good
and then he'll settle down and you move

2913
02:52:05,741 --> 02:52:09,470
to a better spot. And then eventually
even out. The reason why ever happened,

2914
02:52:09,480 --> 02:52:14,480
but we never even reason why Tesla in
segregated areas don't advance like these

2915
02:52:15,371 --> 02:52:19,120
people in Sentinel Island. So kind
of a fucked up example. So in Taiwan,

2916
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:22,900
they're not going anywhere like this is,
they're wearing leaves over there.

2917
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:27,030
Dick for six.
Do they do Joe?

2918
02:52:27,080 --> 02:52:30,640
Really European Union, by the
way. You and I are morons. Okay.

2919
02:52:30,641 --> 02:52:33,850
If we were living on that island, we
would be having leaves over our Dick too.

2920
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:36,820
It's not like, oh, I'm just going to
vet a satellite, these fucking morons.

2921
02:52:36,950 --> 02:52:38,560
Like we don't know how
to do any of that stuff.

2922
02:52:38,590 --> 02:52:42,270
So we would be with them just with a
greater understanding of what's possible.

2923
02:52:43,310 --> 02:52:45,370
But what you just said,
it's happening in the European Union.

2924
02:52:45,730 --> 02:52:49,330
I mean that's why a lot of Polish people
come out to the UK and they come back

2925
02:52:49,331 --> 02:52:50,164
and you know,

2926
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:54,100
and there's also what they're doing now
with immigration is freaking a lot of

2927
02:52:54,101 --> 02:52:57,340
people out because they're allowing so
many people of different cultures to come

2928
02:52:57,341 --> 02:53:02,140
in and then there's cities become more
multicultural than they are English.

2929
02:53:02,410 --> 02:53:03,460
And then it gets real weird.

2930
02:53:03,940 --> 02:53:05,600
The other problem is that
when you have chain currency,

2931
02:53:05,780 --> 02:53:09,730
currency is used to be based on the
productivity of their citizenry, right?

2932
02:53:09,850 --> 02:53:12,820
So when you have currency,
everybody has the same currency,

2933
02:53:12,821 --> 02:53:14,770
which means it's all value.
The same thing.

2934
02:53:15,160 --> 02:53:19,270
Problem is that people in Spain are
not as productive as people in Germany,

2935
02:53:19,271 --> 02:53:20,104
for example.

2936
02:53:20,200 --> 02:53:25,200
So the German goods and services should
be worth more or the dollar there that

2937
02:53:25,651 --> 02:53:27,970
the euro there should be
worth more than it is. Say,

2938
02:53:28,120 --> 02:53:32,650
you know space better when the state has
more power than the, than the Fed. Well,

2939
02:53:32,651 --> 02:53:36,200
it's like countries. That's basically
what, because the argument is,

2940
02:53:36,201 --> 02:53:39,810
is we're like a band of countries like
California. Was the country better though?

2941
02:53:39,830 --> 02:53:42,090
When isn't that better
for the people is better.

2942
02:53:42,850 --> 02:53:46,590
So then that would mean you
know at the same rate, you know,

2943
02:53:46,591 --> 02:53:49,960
it's better to have a country like the
United States than to be well so said the

2944
02:53:49,961 --> 02:53:53,110
Republicans with states,
you can go to any state with countries,

2945
02:53:53,111 --> 02:53:58,030
you can go to any country. You can't get
an in Japan. I mean Japan. I mean, yeah,

2946
02:53:58,031 --> 02:53:58,864
you can't get in there

2947
02:54:01,230 --> 02:54:03,580
10 Syrians I think or something.
What'd you say?

2948
02:54:03,730 --> 02:54:06,880
The Japanese took like 10 Syrians
are trying to get him to Canada.

2949
02:54:07,210 --> 02:54:11,740
I was gonna say kids
these days, they have a,

2950
02:54:11,741 --> 02:54:14,300
they have very liberal immigration.
Kevin is obese.

2951
02:54:14,360 --> 02:54:17,830
The living cause these celebrities,
like I'm so sick of Dominican, his ways.

2952
02:54:17,830 --> 02:54:20,620
I'm headed to Canada. If you have a
Dui and I'll let you win. It's true.

2953
02:54:20,650 --> 02:54:25,150
It's apiece. Got To pay. That's crazy.

2954
02:54:25,540 --> 02:54:29,230
Boys. Let's wrap this bitch that's
wrap this up. It's uh, three 20.

2955
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:33,760
We watched a couple of fights. I feel like
I'm in New York next Friday. Saturday.

2956
02:54:33,790 --> 02:54:35,860
You're doing standup comedy
in New York City, correct?

2957
02:54:35,920 --> 02:54:39,970
Are you doing Gotham comedy club? Yes. I
love that spot. You such a great place.

2958
02:54:40,890 --> 02:54:42,500
And then k.com yes.

2959

02:54:56,350 --> 02:54:57,550
just saying he's in Chicago.

2963
02:54:57,870 --> 02:55:00,730
He doesn't have like a tin foil out
comedy.com or something like that, man.

2964
02:55:00,731 --> 02:55:04,060
Not Be at the Irvine Improv for new years.
Beautiful.

2965
02:55:04,140 --> 02:55:08,780
Or ones that fucking new spot suite. I
heard it's really slow. You went to it?

2966
02:55:08,810 --> 02:55:12,200
Yeah. Yeah, I've done it. Yeah. I love
it. It's a newer than the last one. Well,

2967
02:55:12,230 --> 02:55:17,150
how new is it? Did it move a gun?
No, Bray is all, it is all new.

2968
02:55:17,180 --> 02:55:20,830
I'm talking to everybody. It's been
great. So awesome. Yeah. Done. Yeah.

2969
02:55:20,940 --> 02:55:24,830
Kevin shot a special debt. That's right,
bitch. I was there. Yeah. Okay. Fuck.

2970
02:55:24,831 --> 02:55:29,800
I was here before you even did
comedy son. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

2971
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:33,320
Until I was in the bathroom. You had done
comedy. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

2972
02:55:33,740 --> 02:55:37,700
Did you were in the crowd? Not In the
back. You were in the crowd at one show,

2973
02:55:37,701 --> 02:55:40,340
I think, weren't you sure? Oh
yeah. I was in the back then.

2974
02:55:40,341 --> 02:55:43,950
Went to the craft because I
opened up for crazy. Alright,

2975
02:55:44,540 --> 02:55:48,380
bye everybody. We love you guys
and girls and everybody else.

2976

You guys want to go see
Tito chuck the de facto?

2977
02:55:51,610 --> 02:55:53,500
No.
Is it going to be on.
