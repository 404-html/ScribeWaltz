00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,860
Hello Freak bitches to be
more considerate or more kind.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,690
It's about calling people out on doing
something wrong and stopping them.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,930
Do you think the intent matters
more than the word hundred percent?

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,060
Cause I feel like we saw that a lot with,

5
00:00:15,061 --> 00:00:15,894
um,

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,590
there's a,

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,240
there's two big youtubers
that were in the news,

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:18,780
uh,

9
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,770
or one was in the news.

10
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,970
There was a cutie pie.

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,250
Yeah,

12
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,250
let's talk about that because I saw his
response video and I kinda got sickened.

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,750
Oh really?

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,100
By what's happening to him.

15
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,611
Oh,

16
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,271
by what's happening,

17
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:30,691
I think you're saying.

18
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:31,080
Yeah,

19
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,980
no was words.

20
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,130
Well,

21
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:32,760
he was,

22
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,540
he was crazy.

23
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,260
It was crazy.

24
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,550
The whole thing is insane.

25
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,990
They're making it out like he's
a Nazi and he's not at all.

26
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,560
No.

27
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,030
He had made some,

28
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,250
some videos where he had
told people to not be Nazis.

29
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,090
Not until like two.

30
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,290
Don't you know,

31
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,770
what was his exact words?

32
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,131
I know.

33
00:00:53,131 --> 00:00:54,280
I don't want them to miss [inaudible].

34
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:54,980
They,

35
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,050
it originally started with this
whole fiber video that he did.

36
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,680
Um,

37
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
and then Fiverr.

38
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,361
Yeah.

39
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,630
So it's like a website where you can
get people to do thing for things.

40
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,730
Originally for $5 now for more money.

41
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,040
And so he went through the site.

42
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,140
It all started from this one
video that got him attention.

43
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,140
He went to Fiverr and tried to
get people to do ridiculous,

44
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,980
outrageous things.

45
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,450
Okay.

46
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,220
Um,

47
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,550
get a guy dressed as Jesus
to say something weird.

48
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,020
He got these,

49
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:19,261
uh,

50
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:21,480
the main thing that blew
up where these two guys,

51
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,020
they're like,

52
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,240
they're in like a jungle
setting of some sort.

53
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,941
They dance,

54
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:25,440
they laugh,

55
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,390
they'll hold up a sign,

56
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,233
they'll say something.

57
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,100
And so he was like,

58
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,380
it's going to be hilarious because
they're not going to do it right.

59
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:31,980
They're going to be like,

60
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,490
thank you.

61
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,323
But no.

62
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:33,751
Um,

63
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,750
but they actually made a video where
the guys were laughing and dancing,

64
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,340
held up a sign that said
a death to all Jews and,

65
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,750
and then said to subscribe
to a youtube channel.

66
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,141
Right.

67
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,974
The whole of,

68
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:44,510
uh,

69
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,700
of like someone else asked
them to say death to all Jews.

70
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,191
So he,

71
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,840
he wrote in as like a
cause in the same video.

72
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,220
He gets all these people that are like,

73
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,800
I'm not going to do the stupid
ridiculous thing that you said,

74
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,970
but then they actually did it.

75
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,281
The,

76
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:00,930
the big reason I feel like they did it
is they didn't understand what the words

77
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:02,280
they were writing in the
words that were saying,

78
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,461
oh,

79
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,420
they're from another country.

80
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
What country were they from?

81
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:05,640
I don't know.

82
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,091
I'd have to,

83
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:06,924
I'd have to double check.

84
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,201
Okay.

85
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,240
So they just essentially
wrote down the symbols.

86
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:11,340
They didn't really know
how to even say the word.

87
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,290
And so it is,

88
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,750
there it is.

89
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,390
Oh yeah.

90
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,223
And the laughing.

91
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,521
Yeah.

92
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,680
And so I think this might be
from his explanation video,

93
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,371
but in the first one,

94
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,204
he's like,

95
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,250
why the fuck did they do it?

96
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,730
How do I,

97
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,930
can I even include this?

98
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:22,740
Um,

99
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,710
and so then that sent that got that,

100
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,530
got a little traction and then people
started going through his other videos and

101
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,364
they were like,

102
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:29,941
he's,

103
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,774
he's dressed up.

104
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,021
Uh,

105
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,890
he's watching Hitler.

106
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:36,450
And this one taken completely out of
context of him saying that the Youtube

107
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:36,480
Heroes Program,

108
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,610
which was a program where people can,

109
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,473
uh,

110
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,140
uh,

111
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,710
highlight videos are not highlight them
but mark them down for deletion because

112
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:44,544
they're offensive.

113
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,031
Right?

114
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,930
And so people were like,

115
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,051
oh,

116
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:49,980
that censorship that's you're talking
about like obviously hyperbole.

117
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,090
It's like those are Nazis.

118
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,370
So he made that joke in that relation.

119
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,350
And then there was one,

120
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,050
if I want to say if it
was on the verge or wired,

121
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,230
but then they go even further there.

122
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:01,090
Like he used Leslie Jones Picture,

123
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,243
um,

124
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,160
on Harambie taken completely out
of context because he was using,

125
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,540
uh,

126
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,030
there's this Microsoft Ai Bot
like this chat Bot and you'd say,

127
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,390
uh,

128
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,760
let me see Heran as Jesus.

129
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,830
And uh,

130
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,590
either the AI was messed up or people
had manipulated it where it was putting

131
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,000
Leslie Jones his face on it.

132
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,200
And he was horrified by it.

133
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,161
And that was the whole joke.

134
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,120
But they were saying that he,

135
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,010
he was doing it.

136
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,360
So this is clear.

137
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:24,841
Like he,

138
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:27,480
you saw him use the software
and you saw the error.

139
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,720
You try and use the bot today,

140
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,690
a picture won't come up because now
they are aware that that's what was

141
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:32,524
happening,

142
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:32,861
right?

143
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:35,830
And so they took all these things
and it was this like this crusade of,

144
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,581
look guys,

145
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:37,600
we're looking at this bad guy.

146
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,800
He's the biggest guy on youtube.

147
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,634
He's the bad guy.

148
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,690
We're going to take them down.

149
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,220
So much taken out of context.

150
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,000
Some things are not
defensible where I can't,

151
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,690
I can't say it in the sense of like you
say that words don't have power based on

152
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,111
intent.

153
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,711
And I think there's a,

154
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,700
there's a lot of truth in that.

155
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,750
Not saying words don't
have power baseline tent.

156
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,180
I'm saying that words
should just convey intent.

157
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,690
Right.

158
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,490
And there are times where a word,

159
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,180
there's times where like
you see a friend and you go,

160
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,010
what's up bitch?

161
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,530
And you know you haven't and you're
both laughing and you're being silly.

162
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,450
And then there's times where you call,

163
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,560
some of them want a bitch,

164
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:11,830
right?

165
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,060
Because you think they're being mean.

166
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,330
Yeah.

167
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,790
I mean those two words exactly the same,

168
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,920
but one conveys a
completely different intent.

169
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,710
Right?

170
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,210
But out of this,

171
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:20,631
it was,

172
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:23,870
it was very obvious that they were trying
to do this take down thing and it blew

173
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:25,400
up entirely in their face I think

174
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,610
because I don't think
most people are aware,

175
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,630
I mean there was a Wall
Street Journal article on it,

176
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,220
right,

177
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,751
which was where it,

178
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:34,610
where it got really weird because three
people worked on this and they comb

179
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,080
through hundreds of hours.

180
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,261
Yeah.

181
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:36,410
I mean,

182
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,160
yes.

183
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,070
And they found like instances
of him holding his arm out
like this and they used

184
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,904
that picture.

185
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,060
Like there's a,

186
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,010
I mean that's,

187
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,873
that's weird.

188
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,950
It's very weird.

189
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,521
And then,

190
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,680
and then once all that came
out that they were like,

191
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,543
well,

192
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,800
here's the thing about the context.

193
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,150
He's just like Donald Trump.

194
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,043
And it was,

195
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,310
it was an immediate jump to,

196
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,680
he's using the same tactics
tactics has Donald Trump,

197
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,573
but it's,

198
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,950
it's,

199
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,900
it was just insane.

200
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,141
No,

201
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,130
he's very reasonable.

202
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,210
He did a video response video about
it and the way he handled it was very

203
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,044
reasonable.

204
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,600
And he explained what he was
doing and what's going on.

205
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:10,961
And you know,

206
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,640
he's doing hundreds of hours of him
playing video games and talking and being

207
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,474
silly.

208
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,540
And if you comb through those and take
these things again out of context and try

209
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,890
to make it look like he's a Nazi,

210
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,560
that's a hit piece and
100% and it's deceptive.

211
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,320
It's not indicative of
who was his overall,

212
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,730
it's hard to call it a body of work,

213
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,050
but let's call it a body of work,

214
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,470
right?

215
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,920
His overall body of performance that he's,

216
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,771
that's online,

217
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,640
whatever you want to call it,

218
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:36,990
right?

219
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,020
His talking,

220
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,550
it's not who he is.

221
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:43,300
So that for them to call him a
Nazi and say that Pooty Pie has,

222
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:43,511
you know,

223
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,570
seven videos where he's
done something about Nazis,

224
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,720
like people when they're
doing these long forms,

225
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:50,920
spit ball,

226
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,170
improvisation videos like that,

227
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,670
and you're interacting with people,

228
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,010
you're going to say all kinds
of shit that in the moment

229
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,210
is legitimate.

230
00:05:59,530 --> 00:05:59,740
Right?

231
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,050
But if you chop it up and edit it and
splice them all together and then make a

232
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,380
five minute montage of him saying Nazi,

233
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,390
like he's obsessed with Nazis and with
what kind of sucked from it was a lot of

234
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,600
people think that,

235
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,020
oh,

236
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,420
they're there articles about
the downfall of Pewdie Pie.

237
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,550
I think he's gone up half a million,

238
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,640
if not more than a million subscribers
since all of this happened.

239
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,911
Right.

240
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,620
So he's gotten all this new support.

241
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,910
He's a temporary phase for a,

242
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,630
for free speech,

243
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,750
free speech and uh,

244
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,120
persecution for mainstream media.

245
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,541
Didn't,

246
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:27,410
you'd lose some,

247
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,000
some get a matter for him though.

248
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,570
He so,

249
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,850
I mean it sucks more for the people
that we're working on that project.

250
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,020
What was the project?

251
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,490
So it was scare Cutie Pie.

252
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,121
Season two.

253
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,470
It was a youtube red series.

254
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,980
Um,

255
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,060
so they were,

256
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,650
I think there were about
to go into production,

257
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
um,

258
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,720
and,

259
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,960
and so then that got canceled.

260
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,250
So Youtube didn't want to fund that.

261
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,020
And I said it,

262
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,711
he said it.

263
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:48,320
He understands why they would have to
separate because then it becomes a story

264
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:52,370
of Youtube and beauty or youtube
and Disney support an antisemite.

265
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,160
Right?

266
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
He's not an antisense.

267
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:54,640
Right.

268
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,330
So why would they back away?

269
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,670
I think because they were scared that
the Wall Street Journal was like,

270
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,260
did you see all of this?

271
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,500
We're going to write this article out
of the Wall Street Journal at that slip

272
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:03,920
through.

273
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,530
That seems to me very irresponsible.

274
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,120
Any of them are standing by it though.

275
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,810
Many people,

276
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,141
yes,

277
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:13,760
100% and the many are touting it as
this victory because he lost a Google

278
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,350
preferred ads on youtube,

279
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:15,831
which I will say,

280
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:19,670
I don't know how he was still seeing
as family friendly cause I'm not family

281
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,250
friendly on my show his past two years,

282
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:22,820
at the very least,

283
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,653
not family friendly.

284
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,231
Uh,

285
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,064
and then uh,

286
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,903
dropped by maker.

287
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,481
Uh,

288
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:26,990
he doesn't,

289
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:27,801
he doesn't need his,

290
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:28,040
uh,

291
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,640
his MCN has his company around him
and the youtube red series is nothing.

292
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,380
He's still going to make
millions of dollars.

293
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,010
He's grown it.

294
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:35,751
It's a good thing.

295
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:37,100
I feel like it now,

296
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:37,431
if you,

297
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,510
if you have mainstream media,

298
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,440
try and take a swing at you.

299
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,000
It's some of the best
promotion in the world.

300
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,241
Okay.

301
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,200
But why did they take a swing at him
and why is anyone saying that they took

302
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,220
down a bad guy?

303
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,931
I think that it's,

304
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:50,270
it's a big thing of them
trying to label and it's once,

305
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,691
once again,

306
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,770
it's the problem with a
lot of media is there,

307
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,840
they're overextending,

308
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,230
right?

309
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,280
They all of a sudden start talking about
this narrative about outright and the

310
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:00,620
rise of white supremacy
again in this country.

311
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,020
And then they look at this
big guy and they're like,

312
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,610
we can use him as an example.

313
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,280
We can be the heroes that expose this,

314
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,540
that do the takedown piece.

315
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,260
Um,

316
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,730
and they're not and they're not.

317
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,140
And they're like so driven for that,

318
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,430
that they then just,

319
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:13,940
they go,

320
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,500
oh well maybe that doesn't add up there.

321
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,401
It's an argument.

322
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,300
But we have the power,

323
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:20,570
we have the size of the audience were
good and it just blew up in their face.

324
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,120
So they were thinking they
could get away with it.

325
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:24,470
Even though it wasn't kosher.

326
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,730
I believe so too.

327
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,230
What is the response so far?

328
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,880
Do you know?

329
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,170
Have you read anything about it?

330
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,190
But as far as like fans or
Wall Street Journal posts,

331
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,270
post chick digging their heels in and
then a lot of people started trying to

332
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:40,430
find as always a dirge stuff.

333
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,380
Turn it on like the,

334
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:43,830
the authors in the past one was like a,

335
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,060
a joke from 2015 because and,

336
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,821
and while,

337
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:47,391
pardon me would go,

338
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:48,170
well that's petty.

339
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,120
If the argument is that
context doesn't matter,

340
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,340
then fine then then look at these guys,

341
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,780
what they said a year ago.

342
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,740
Look at what they are saying.

343
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,291
Now look,

344
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,060
the writers who have
the art of the article,

345
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:57,750
like I think Ben,

346
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,900
Ben Fritz was one of the art with
the writer is where you made a,

347
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,250
I can't,

348
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,470
I never knew Jews were
so good at frying joke,

349
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,920
uh,

350
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,611
from way back.

351
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,880
And then he made another joke about a,

352
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,620
it was like a back and forth
with someone where he said,

353
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,250
you know,

354
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,900
these racial jokes are so stupid.

355
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,010
And then someone said,

356
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,551
Eh,

357
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:14,881
you know,

358
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,661
they hit everyone.

359
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,021
And he said,

360
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,290
well,

361
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,520
at least the black jokes are funny.

362
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,354
Those ones,

363
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,223
those ones are funny.

364
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:19,670
Um,

365
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,461
and so people were like,

366
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:20,641
well,

367
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:20,850
if,

368
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,160
if,

369
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,530
if context doesn't matter,

370
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,430
are you a scumbag?

371
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,400
And,

372
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,990
and then people just dismissed it as are
a lot of mainstream people dismissed it

373
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:28,350
as like,

374
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,950
oh,

375
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,400
that's,

376
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,270
that's not the same thing.

377
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,370
How could anyone say
context doesn't matter.

378
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
That's insane.

379
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:35,040
That is an insane thing to say.

380
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,390
Is that literally what they said,

381
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,010
they context it does not matter.

382
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,641
What was it?

383
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,331
It was one of the,

384
00:09:39,331 --> 00:09:40,700
one of the people I'm going to get the,

385
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,540
the problem is so many
people have written about it.

386
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,940
There was one article that
was promoted and it said,

387
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,570
uh,

388
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,860
all these are articles,

389
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,190
uh,

390
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,410
or all these people defending Felix with.

391
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:50,460
But context,

392
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,960
that's,

393
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,070
that's a bullshit argument
and that's insane.

394
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,570
If you think that that's an insane,

395
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,410
so everything exists in a,

396
00:09:56,411 --> 00:09:57,810
in a highly edited bubble.

397
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:58,440
Dope.

398
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,580
So that's ruined everyone's career.

399
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,460
If you're talking about a
mathematician discussing algorithms,

400
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,180
yes.

401
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,090
Context doesn't really mean that much
because he's talking about numbers,

402
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:07,530
but we're not talking about numbers.

403
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,820
Talking about words.

404
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,150
Yeah.

405
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,120
We're talking about the way people
express themselves and we're talking about

406
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:14,490
someone who's generally
considered to be humorous.

407
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,421
I mean,

408
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:15,991
Pooty Pie,

409
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,000
a lot of his stuff is
playful and humorous.

410
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,290
So if your humerus and you're playing
around and you say something that might

411
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,124
be,

412
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,810
I don't even want to use the appropriate,

413
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,610
it might be the thing for him to say in
that moment to try to be entertaining.

414
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,000
Right.

415
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,280
That does not mean he's a Nazi and two,

416
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,930
to label him like that is
incredibly irresponsible and it's,

417
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,770
it's really bad.

418
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,301
I mean,

419
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:40,140
I'm not a lawyer,

420
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,230
but I would sue the fuck
out of him if I was him.

421
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,380
I would sue the fuck out of them for sure.

422
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah.

423
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,000
Because what they're doing
is misrepresenting who he
is as a human being and

424
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,130
even if it's beneficial in the long run,

425
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,650
it's super dangerous
to set that precedent.

426
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:55,831
Well,

427
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:57,000
especially something in this,

428
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,530
in this climate where you say,

429
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,830
this is what he supports
and it 100% isn't.

430
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,490
How do you know someone doesn't
just see those articles,

431
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:05,310
it doesn't see as defense
and tries to kill the guy.

432
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,640
But why would the Wall Street
Journal do something like this?

433
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,040
Wait to jump back to,

434
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,030
to what you were saying about mainstream.

435
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:12,990
Do they have to go back?

436
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Matt Pooty Pie guy and Europe places
I get scared when everyone talks about

437
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,770
stuff in generalities.

438
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,071
Right?

439
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:20,670
When I talk about,

440
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,810
and I'm guilty of it too,

441
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:23,400
when I talk about like
all mainstream media,

442
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,300
it's not everyone,

443
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,110
you know.

444
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,620
Um,

445
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,550
but there are,

446
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:26,831
I,

447
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:30,960
I stopped doing interviews with mainstream
outlets several years ago because

448
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:32,220
they made everything about,

449
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,670
like I would talk about all the really
cool ventures that we're going into,

450
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:36,021
how,

451
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,590
how our space is changing things up.

452
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,630
And it would always be turned into.

453
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,530
Um,

454
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,280
one comment that maybe was somewhat
critical of let's say like a,

455
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,580
a studio and all become about that.

456
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,320
Or if all become about like the money and,

457
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:50,911
and I was like,

458
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,680
you just fucking
manipulating what I'm saying.

459
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,543
I don't want to deal with it.

460
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,420
Yeah.

461
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,870
And so the point is become,

462
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,590
uh,

463
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:56,861
when,

464
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:00,280
when the Wall Street Journal knocks
on Felix his door after they didn't

465
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:01,360
apparently approach him,

466
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,780
uh,

467
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,680
for the original story.

468
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:03,071
And they're like,

469
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:03,311
hey,

470
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:04,930
we want to give you a
platform to tell your story.

471
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:05,171
It's like,

472
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:05,920
fuck you.

473
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,820
Is that what they're doing now?

474
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,140
Uh,

475
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,331
yeah.

476
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:07,451
They,

477
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,060
after the story broke and there were all
these people that came to his defense,

478
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,463
they came to him.

479
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,303
Now I'm not going to,

480
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,260
that's what I think that's
what a journalist should do.

481
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:14,801
Right.

482
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,430
Talk to the fucking main source,

483
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,930
but not be after the fact.

484
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,793
Journalists.

485
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,241
Well,

486
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,160
so I think from what Felix,

487
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,820
uh,

488
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,180
wrote,

489
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,350
it was the Wall Street Journal.

490
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,780
They left their cards and that's
how he knew it was 100% of them.

491
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,950
Um,

492
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,980
but why does someone,

493
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,271
I mean,

494
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,760
what I mean is different journalists
from the Wall Street Journal,

495
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,960
not the same age as me to hit.

496
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,490
I don't know if it was the same ones.

497
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,061
He didn't.

498
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:34,894
He didn't say,

499
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,531
Hey,

500
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:36,400
we're super sorry.

501
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,610
We called you a Nazi in front of millions
of people and we were totally lying.

502
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:39,850
Yeah,

503
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,560
but the argument all
of a sudden is it why?

504
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,480
Why should he do an interview
with the Wall Street Journal?

505
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,100
Maybe because they have
a different audience,

506
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:49,690
but he has his own larger platform
where he controls the narrative.

507
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,650
He's not going to be selectively,

508
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,790
but he's not speaking to the people that
the Wall Street Journal risperidone him

509
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,211
in front of it,

510
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:58,960
but I would assume that there are also
covering their ass by going to him and

511
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,670
reaching out and giving him a platform.

512
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:01,420
They can say,

513
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:01,691
well,

514
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:05,050
we gave him a chance to
respond in the facts remain.

515
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,260
He did say those things
and they are valid I think.

516
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,590
I think if he was confident enough,

517
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:13,320
you should probably do what I've seen
Milo Yiannopoulos do in the past where he

518
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:14,790
had someone film at the same time,

519
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,310
so if they did misrepresent
him in some manner

520
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,760
matter,

521
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,830
it doesn't matter because
they've already done it.

522
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,140
They've already misrepresented
him in the article.

523
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:23,650
If they,

524
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,290
if he has someone film
his response to that,

525
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:26,561
I don't know.

526
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:26,980
I mean,

527
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,251
I mean,

528
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,320
just if he did something with them,

529
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:29,921
right.

530
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:30,850
If they did film something,

531
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,600
I understood the film,

532
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,111
the entire thing,

533
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:32,920
just so you can show,

534
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,250
but I'm saying it doesn't matter
because they've already done the damage,

535
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,150
the damaging thing.

536
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,810
Like how many people who read the first
thing or even going to read the second

537
00:13:40,811 --> 00:13:41,070
thing,

538
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,430
right?

539
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,880
It might even be 30%.

540
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,020
Well,

541
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,500
that's 70% people.

542
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,400
And how many people just read the Wall
Street Journal and maybe a local paper

543
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,640
and our online and aren't hearing
all these responses and they go,

544
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:51,940
oh,

545
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,280
you know,

546
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,290
he's catch their son.

547
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,030
Oh,

548
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,970
I'm watching Pooty pie.

549
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,091
Oh,

550
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:56,140
you watching that Nazi?

551
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,190
That guy's a Nazi.

552
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,431
No,

553
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:58,264
he's not dead.

554
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,470
You hate everything I like

555
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,700
and now that kid's doing meth
for the rest of his life.

556
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,490
I don't know.

557
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:03,661
No,

558
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:03,791
I,

559
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,220
uh,

560
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,120
I,

561
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,380
I think that it is sad,

562
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:07,561
right?

563
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:07,771
That's,

564
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:09,020
that's a huge problem with,

565
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:12,090
with a lot of the fake news or
just news that's false is the,

566
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,770
the crazy salacious shit.

567
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,060
If you then look at the correction half
the time that gets like 20 times the

568
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:18,870
shares,

569
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,231
you know why?

570
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,430
Cause it's fucking insane.

571
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:20,641
It's like,

572
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:21,600
did you see this?

573
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,680
Did you see this thing?

574
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,760
And it's something that I've been
critical of people I like in the industry,

575
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,890
a critical level out
of the mainstream guys.

576
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,270
I don't like it.

577
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,620
And it sucks because there's not,

578
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,730
there's not a clear answer.

579
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,400
Do you delete the false thing and
then it looks like you're hiding that

580
00:14:35,401 --> 00:14:36,234
information.

581
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,870
Um,

582
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,060
do you do what?

583
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,780
You should definitely
delete the false thing.

584
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:39,951
But,

585
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,130
so that's my argument.

586
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:41,651
But then there's,

587
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,980
there's an argument that you,

588
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,450
you leave it up because you
show that you were wrong.

589
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,351
If it's on Twitter,

590
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,250
you quote tweet it,

591
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:47,851
but that's still,

592
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,170
that's still doesn't fix it because,

593
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,040
um,

594
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,130
as much as we talk about and separation

595
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,173
that tweet,

596
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,450
that promotion of a thing is separate
from everything else in the world.

597
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,240
Tweets are problematic anyway
because it's 140 characters.

598
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:02,900
And it's very difficult to adequately
explain some subjects and 140 characters.

599
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:05,390
But if you put out some
information that's not true,

600
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:06,650
like this Pooty pie thing,

601
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,230
right?

602
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,850
You absolutely should print a
retraction and you absolutely,

603
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:11,301
if you have,

604
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,500
it's still up on your website.

605
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,800
The first thing you should say is this
is all taken out of context and it's

606
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:19,280
incorrect and it's not.

607
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:23,060
It does not represent who this guy is
and you should absolutely not have those

608
00:15:23,061 --> 00:15:24,140
writers do that again.

609
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,710
Right?

610
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,960
I mean whether you fire them
or whether you assignment,

611
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,750
who knows what they were asked to do.

612
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,170
This is another part of the problem.

613
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,300
Was this an independent thing that
they decided to pursue on their own?

614
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,490
Did someone ask them to do it?

615
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,310
Was there someone who decided
that this guy was a Nazi?

616
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:43,290
Cause that maybe they tuned in at the
very moment he was doing something right

617
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,920
and they're like [inaudible] and
some people obviously are very,

618
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,150
very sensitive to that kind of stuff.

619
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:48,560
So I think that's why it's important,

620
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:49,410
especially on a,

621
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,930
an editorial team of some sorts.

622
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:54,770
I have people with with mixed opinions
because it's very easy to all of a sudden

623
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,170
get railroaded behind
an idea of just like,

624
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:57,351
yeah,

625
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:57,771
look at these,

626
00:15:57,771 --> 00:16:00,110
look at these seven specific things.

627
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,400
We're not going to say
that it's out of context,

628
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,420
but look at this information.

629
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,850
We got this guy we got where
they got this guy dead to rights,

630
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,271
but it's,

631
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,110
it's all flimsy.

632
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,280
Well,

633
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,760
again,

634
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,451
context,

635
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:09,020
right?

636
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,853
As soon as you,

637
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,250
that is part of the problem with doing
something like you do and it's certainly

638
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:18,251
part of the problem with a co a podcast
is if you're talking for three hours and

639
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,790
you take these little snippets of
those three hours out of context,

640
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,760
it paints a completely distorted
perception of who the person is,

641
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,230
but that that's also a problem
with language in general.

642
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,420
It really is a problem with,

643
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:36,350
and it's certainly a problem with words
and that's one of the problems with

644
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,710
these quote magic words like that
you're not supposed to say anymore.

645
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,000
Whatever those words are,

646
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,200
you know,

647
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,490
the,

648
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:42,830
you,

649
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,640
you,

650
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,640
you give the weight gives so much weight
to these words that just taken alone

651
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:50,850
on,

652
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,710
on their own.

653
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:52,820
They can get you in trouble.

654
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:53,600
Just saying,

655
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,940
uttering the phrase as if it was a magic.

656
00:16:55,941 --> 00:16:56,810
Abracadabra.

657
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,100
I think it get you in trouble.

658
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:01,730
I think it's important that we stopped
trying to a got it rhymes and it's not on

659
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:02,240
purpose.

660
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,790
We have to stop just blindly
hating and we try and educate.

661
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,600
Right.

662
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,570
I think that don't blindly hate educate.

663
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,370
It's an afterschool specials.
