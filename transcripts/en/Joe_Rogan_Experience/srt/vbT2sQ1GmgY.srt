1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
Hello Freak bitches saw
that his majesty thing,

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:06,510
right?

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,080
You saw that,

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,913
huh?

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,190
Oh,

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,023
you haven't seen this.

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,090
So University of Michigan,

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,650
like a lot of universities.

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,200
Yes.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,180
Now doing this,

11
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,540
uh,

12
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:15,811
you know,

13
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,070
like you sign up for class,

14
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,460
your professor sends out an email to the
entire class and professor Joe Rogan,

15
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,530
my preferred pronouns are he him.

16
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,970
And then this one kid was able to cause
you can voluntary choose your pronoun.

17
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,240
He was like minus his majesty of it.

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,463
What a good kid.

19
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,800
His whole thing was to a
point out the absurdity of it,

20
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,634
but then people are like,

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,230
you're a fucking asshole.

22
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,180
Like they're all mad at him.

23
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:44,070
Now his name is grant Strobel.

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,670
Chairman of the young Americans Foundation
do use the new policy to update his

25
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:49,470
preferred Pronoun to His Majesty.

26
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,060
How could they be mad at him?

27
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,690
That is,

28
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,460
that is no more ridiculous than h.

29
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:53,671
I.

30
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:58,410
R of course there's like 18 different
gender pronouns now we've been identified

31
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,050
and we also know there's astral gendered.

32
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,310
If you're feeling like you're
part of the cosmos or eat Polly,

33
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,550
I'm Pauline by.

34
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,553
Yeah,

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,960
you put it on your,

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,420
your pot.

37
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,050
You put it on his podcast or
he's a Twitter page like a,

38
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,990
it was like by awareness day and then,

39
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,010
and then some,

40
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
some guy,

41
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,900
a real professor was
tweeting and he retweeted.

42
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:24,930
It wasn't something that
was so close to parity.

43
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,830
What the fuck did he say?

44
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,910
He was just like,

45
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,780
it was the wording of it was
too absurd to even recall.

46
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:31,614
But it was like,

47
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,440
remember when you're the teacher today on,

48
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,323
on um,

49
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,860
by awareness day,

50
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:42,861
your gender and your to be by
is not to be gender specific,

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,920
but your specific to city of your gender
can also dictate what your sexuality

52
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,040
might be like.

53
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,550
What,

54
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,420
like something like that.

55
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,283
Something,

56
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,933
I dunno.

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
And then it was like happy by awareness.

58
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,481
You know,

59
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:02,481
I finally used an all gender restroom in
Portland and it was at a gay bar and I

60
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:03,680
got,

61
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,010
I didn't enjoy it.

62
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,110
And it's not because of
the whole Pronoun thing.

63
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,440
It's because you've got like dude's
taking gnarly shits next to you.

64
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,363
That's an issue.

65
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
I don't need it.

66
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,623
Yeah.

67
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,450
I don't need it zooms
or is A's I'm and by,

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,100
and I'm also fluid gender.

69
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,430
My favorite thing is to be fluid gender
because you can go however you're

70
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,940
feeling in the moment,

71
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,730
but you have to,

72
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,610
people have to know what to call you,

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,510
so you have to,

74
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,500
that's my favorite.

75
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,780
Announce constantly that we want.

76
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,850
We saw this video of
this guy who was like,

77
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,661
he was like,

78
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:36,811
you know,

79
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,550
you should really respect
people's pronouns,

80
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:38,971
which,

81
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:39,540
which I owe.

82
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:39,811
I'm like,

83
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:40,590
okay.

84
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,230
Then he goes and if you see
somebody and you're not sure,

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,320
just ask them.

86
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,641
Be like,

87
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,060
Hey,

88
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,893
what's your pronoun?

89
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:46,860
To which I say,

90
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,251
no,

91
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,084
you fucking don't.

92
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,750
Like,

93
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,280
you're not going to just
see somebody and be like,

94
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,890
Hey,

95
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,080
hey,

96
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,913
I'm just wondering.

97
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,383
She pronouns.

98
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,440
I think that the elders
should be on the person.

99
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,780
The Steven Crowder.

100
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,120
Steven Crowder has a fucking hilarious
video where he actually does this and

101
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,510
he'll go,

102
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,721
yeah,

103
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:05,380
he goes out and asks people what
their preferred gender pronouns are.

104
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,240
And they,

105
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,090
there's the,

106
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,380
the looks they give him,

107
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:11,500
like he goes to like grown adults and it
goes up to them on the street and just

108
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:14,320
talks to them and just wonders what
their preferred gender Pronoun is.

109
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,090
Nobody knows what the
fuck you're talking about.

110
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,110
Preposterous.

111
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,640
I can't wait for the backlash is
what's that video of that Guy Dustin?

112
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,750
Dakota.

113
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,583
Dakota.

114
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,443
Yeah.

115
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,930
We'd have to show Joe that one.

116
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,190
Dakota is amazing.

117
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:28,990
Did you even see the thing?

118
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:29,770
Yeah,

119
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,700
to code is incredible.

120
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,040
This Zinzer Zinzer there's a,

121
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,501
Oh for the,

122
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:36,850
the different gender pronouns.

123
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,180
Why is it so hard?

124
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,650
Why can't you just do what they ask?

125
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,660
My pronouns are not preferred
c and the thing is like,

126
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,300
I feel like there's
enough people going okay,

127
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,430
really that it's kind of a legitimate
thing to not be 100% on board with us.

128
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,150
You know,

129
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,080
cause I feel a little like,

130
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,251
oh,

131
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:56,680
am I on the wrong end of
history are not preferred.

132
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,390
Ask a gender terrorist.

133
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,230
There you go.

134
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,063
Whoa.

135
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,250
This is the newest video on my Oscar
gender terrorist playlist on my channel.

136
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,570
Are we allowed to play this without,

137
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,433
Huh?

138
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,020
Yeah,

139
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,760
you can't.

140
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,593
You can't just play it.

141
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,070
Well,

142
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,580
we're not showing it on youtube.

143
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,970
Are we like picture in
picture about take it off.

144
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,431
Yeah,

145
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,264
take it off.

146
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,250
It's this dude's,

147
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,103
there's dude.

148
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,900
Whatever it is that's got a beard.

149
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,441
Not,

150
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,870
I know it doesn't have a
preferred gender pronoun.

151
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,070
Well that's what you're looking at.

152
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:30,904
We're going to get to,

153
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,500
so that's the thing now,

154
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:32,741
right?

155
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,270
You can kind of be
whatever you want to be.

156
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:34,661
Yeah,

157
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,231
which is fine.

158
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:40,231
I guess I just think it's funny that some
people are saying that you should see

159
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,870
this individual and lead with like,

160
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,090
it's like almost like it's
rude for you to assume,

161
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,830
which I think is absurd
that you're going to,

162
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,800
that it's rude to assume like if you,

163
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,290
if you're going to dictate
a different pronoun,

164
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,610
I think that should be on you.

165
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,321
Like a status.

166
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:03,820
Like you should just show people or some
people do have these little stickers

167
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,370
that they put on my
preferred gender Pronoun is.

168
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,270
That's cool.

169
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,540
Well,

170
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,050
here's a radio lab and this is
one of my all time favorite ones.

171
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,740
There's a radio lab podcast.

172
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,920
They take it so seriously
because it's radio lab and uh,

173
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,200
there's a guy on it who's clearly out
of his fucking mind and he goes back and

174
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,310
forth between male and female.

175
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:27,790
He switches while he's talking
to you because I just switched.

176
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,653
I just switched.

177
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,543
I'm the man now.

178
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,250
And you're like,

179
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:30,401
well,

180
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:30,940
okay,

181
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,980
when do you get to be a dragon?

182
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,310
Do you get to read minds when
this book tell the future?

183
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,720
Then we're supposed to respect this.

184
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,070
You have to because it's,

185
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,390
it has to do with gender.

186
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,830
So if this guy was telling
you about his past lives,

187
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,101
you know,

188
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:49,210
as a Roman gladiator or if he was telling
you about the future when the star

189
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,140
ships land,

190
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,880
you would think that he's a crazy person.

191
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,570
Right?

192
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,890
But I think it right now,

193
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,690
but we did talk about gender.

194
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,800
As soon as you start talking about gender,

195
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,820
you,

196
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,870
you really,

197
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,900
you're supposed to like give
people the benefit of all doubt.

198
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,200
Like even if you think you're switching
gender back and forth as you're talking,

199
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,710
like the idea that you're your genders,

200
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,100
like some sort of a seesaw,

201
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,790
you're on the precipice and you can just
go left or right to left or right and

202
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,680
it is you just close minded asshole.

203
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,170
You just decide.

204
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,351
Yeah.

205
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,530
You don't understand Joe.

206
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,640
But here's the thing,

207
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,220
are we different a lot of the time?

208
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,671
Yes.

209
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:26,780
Why can't be expressed in gender like
you the other day when you're cranky

210
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,710
because you didn't get your sugar.

211
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,520
Yeah,

212
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:28,850
right?

213
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,360
Yeah.

214
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,630
Like what dance,

215
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,660
right?

216
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,340
You have a different personality trait.

217
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,830
You fell into this bitchy it
doesn't like but doesn't like that.

218
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,880
That feeling that the going back like
sexist and need a fire join up jetboat

219
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,550
phobic nervous.

220
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,543
Well,

221
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,923
I'm looking forward.

222
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,020
I'm looking forward to ignoring so many
emails that are going to come into my

223
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,970
inbox about this conversation,

224
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:53,853
but too,

225
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,220
but people get mad.

226
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,491
Oh,

227
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:56,720
I know they're going to get so mad.

228
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,650
My point is like,

229
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,000
we've talked about this,

230
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,980
like if you're feeling
particularly lovie dovie right,

231
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,990
you're the pet and kittens and you're,

232
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,630
you're putting your
daughter's hair in ponytails.

233
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,150
[inaudible] it's a more feminine feeling.

234
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,670
So did you switch genders at that moment?

235
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,031
No.

236
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,590
You still specifically,

237
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,560
this guy wanted to go back and forth
to being recognized as a man and then

238
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:23,390
recommend the middle of the conversation
and then as he goes back and forth,

239
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,800
he becomes a totally different person.

240
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:25,611
Like,

241
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,240
yes.

242
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Like he's not going to
tolerate any bullshit.

243
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,410
I think usually in the military too.

244
00:07:29,411 --> 00:07:29,800
I was like,

245
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,320
it was like,

246
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,530
hmm.

247
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,970
There's a lot of weirdness to the story.

248
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,250
And he's under the care
of a psychiatrist though,

249
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:34,510
right?

250
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:34,640
No,

251
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:34,751
no,

252
00:07:34,751 --> 00:07:34,941
no,

253
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,091
no.

254
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,270
He's wondering around getting
government grants and great.

255
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,081
Oh Wow.

256
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:39,740
I have no idea.

257
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,730
I have no idea what he's doing.

258
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
But um,

259
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,303
I just,

260
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,530
you never go.

261
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,790
Like if someone goes back and
forth and pretends to be Hungarian,

262
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,380
I'm Hungarian.

263
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:51,591
No,

264
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:51,870
I'm not.

265
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,051
No,

266
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:52,281
no,

267
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:52,461
no.

268
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:53,870
I'm from Ireland right now,

269
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,670
but I feel today I'm
now I'm Hungarian again.

270
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:55,941
Right.

271
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:57,140
I'm identifying that way.

272
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,850
But

273
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,181
fine.

274
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:58,331
Like,

275
00:07:58,331 --> 00:07:58,841
here's the thing,

276
00:07:58,841 --> 00:08:01,060
if you want to identify
throughout the day,

277
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,010
sometimes I am more masculine.

278
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:05,080
When I'm at the comedy store performing,

279
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,760
I am very alpha male.

280
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,594
I'm very,

281
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,453
it's macho,

282
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,251
but I do,

283
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:13,750
I have to demand that people know
what to call me at every given moment.

284
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,310
That's a little unrealistic.

285
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,390
What's a new thing?

286
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,090
I mean it's so presumptuous.

287
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:22,080
A narcissistic that you
should know what to call.

288
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,400
Does this person at
least say like right now,

289
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,780
address me as her,

290
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,350
right?

291
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,900
Yeah.

292
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,210
My shooter for names.

293
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,220
He looks snip and you just
see the shit out of them.

294
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
Depending on who I'm,

295
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:36,200
I might be mis-gendering or not depending
on how he here or she hears it at the

296
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,390
moment when you get points,

297
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,030
if you're in a conversation
with that person,

298
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,993
yeah.

299
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,750
Would you cope like you
feel like that's a respect,

300
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,890
like something that you'd be like,

301
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,091
oh,

302
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:46,924
okay,

303
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,320
I'll,

304
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll respect your wishes.

305
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,100
I'm not changing your gender.

306
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,030
You gotta pick one.

307
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,140
Yeah.

308
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,651
If you say,

309
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:55,230
girl,

310
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,460
Oh,

311
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,960
okay,

312
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,580
you're a girl.

313
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,360
I'm cool with that.

314
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,650
I don't have any problem with that.

315
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,180
But you can't go back and forth.

316
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:00,630
Yeah.

317
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,890
Okay.

318
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,040
Where I can't talk to you.

319
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,360
Yeah,

320
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,860
it's too much work is in other words.

321
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:04,660
Yeah.

322
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,060
I think that's the whole thing.

323
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,420
Yeah.

324
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,890
It's too much fucking work.

325
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:08,671
And if you're an adult,

326
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,720
it's got a full life.

327
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,730
How the fuck are you have room in your
head for the Zim Jerseys every second

328
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,330
changing.

329
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,481
Well,

330
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,200
not only that,

331
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,340
that's somebody else's issue.

332
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:17,670
Right?

333
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,780
What about yourself?

334
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,681
You know,

335
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,640
I don't have any,

336
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,480
I don't even be room to communicate
with you because you're concentrating on

337
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,560
yourself so much.

338
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
You want people to
change how they address.

339
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,890
You just can you just change how you
feel occasionally and not have a new

340
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,220
fucking name three
o'clock in the afternoon.

341
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,450
Now I'm Bob.

342
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,560
Why did we have to label
it every moment of every,

343
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:40,951
well,

344
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,850
it's a super self indulgent thing and
that's what you're getting out of this and

345
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,260
that's what like the people that are,

346
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:46,621
you know,

347
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,810
they're being labeled as insensitive.

348
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,220
Like that's kind of the point.

349
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:50,821
The point is like,

350
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:50,971
yeah,

351
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:53,130
you're supposed to be
insensitive of nonsense.

352
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,590
This deserves a fair amount of mockery.

353
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,870
The Fairmount afraid to in part because
we're going to get shamed on Twitter.

354
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,120
People are going to call
us phobic of this and that.

355
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:07,560
Even if you say something remotely
on politically correct or whatever.

356
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,010
Yeah.

357
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,290
Look,

358
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,330
there's a bunch of people out there that
are just not happy and they might not

359
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,530
be happy with the gender.

360
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:15,390
They might not be happy
with the way they look.

361
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,340
They might not be happy
with how old they are.

362
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,290
They might not be happy with
a bunch of different things,

363
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:24,770
but we have like rules as far as like
what you can change and what you can't

364
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:30,300
change and we're allowing people now this
is like a really recent thing to just

365
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:31,560
decide to change your gender,

366
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,630
which doesn't affect me.

367
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,730
I want people to have freedom,

368
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,983
doesn't bother me,

369
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,730
but what?

370
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,953
What is this?

371
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,840
There's an addendum to
the radio lab story.

372
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,400
She made them edit out the references
to her actually changing her identity.

373
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,234
I guess she stopped,

374
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,450
she stopped switching after all this
right here and she no longer flips.

375
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,373
Interesting.

376
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,633
Hmm.

377
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,900
She now remains comfortable
as a queer trans woman.

378
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,560
What does,

379
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,393
what does that mean?

380
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,220
What's like,

381
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,560
it's not queer.

382
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:05,490
There's not gay though.

383
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,811
No,

384
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:09,600
I thought it meant that
queer is like weird.

385
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,980
Like you can do both,

386
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:11,850
right?

387
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,510
Isn't it?

388
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,230
What does queer then let,

389
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,323
how do you

390
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,610
know gay is gay?

391
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,260
Queer is not gay.

392
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,210
Queer.

393
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,630
It's like non defined.

394
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,493
Okay,

395
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,370
so and not a non defined trail on binary.

396
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,360
That's Tom's domain.

397
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:30,751
Tom,

398
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,770
can you explain this?

399
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,460
I mean basically,

400
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,201
well you guys,

401
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:39,210
you fall on the binary spectrum.

402
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,590
Cisgendered privileging.

403
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,121
Okay,

404
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,810
here we go.

405
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,071
Shit.

406
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:43,801
A queer feeling.

407
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:44,011
Nope.

408
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,820
That's not it.

409
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,810
A homosexual.

410
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,620
No,

411
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:46,951
no.

412
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:48,690
See they're using a different,

413
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,240
now see it used to be homosexual,

414
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,500
but it's not just a homosexual anymore.

415
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:53,801
Okay.

416
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,790
Terms and definitions.

417
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,080
Lbgt right there.

418
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:56,770
Click on that one.

419
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,060
Lgbtq now.

420
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,601
Oh No,

421
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,750
there's an I and an a in
there to look at that.

422
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,050
See,

423
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
look at that.

424
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,230
Make that largest fucking shitty.

425
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:05,860
Ask you read it.

426
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,461
Bisexual,

427
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,540
transgender credit.

428
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,141
Yeah,

429
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:08,471
look at it.

430
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:09,310
But look at above.

431
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:09,850
Above,

432
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,170
above the top loop.

433
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,223
LG,

434
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,380
LGBT,

435
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,303
ga.

436
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,810
What is TB?

437
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,723
Lg.

438
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,431
Queer.

439
00:12:17,431 --> 00:12:18,241
Asexual,

440
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:22,790
queer or asexual or
questioning and asexual or,

441
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,410
but there's intersexual too.

442
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,244
There's I,

443
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,270
some people choose.

444
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:27,470
I wait,

445
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:27,920
what's that?

446
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,470
What does that all,

447
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,090
no,

448
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,810
let's get to Q queer,

449
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,170
Intersex as Jamie,

450
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,610
an umbrella term used by l g B t Q.

451
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,140
A people to revert to the entire L.

452
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,140
G.

453
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,230
B t community and alternative that some
people used to queer is the idea that

454
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,970
labels and categories such as lesbian,

455
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:47,211
gay,

456
00:12:47,211 --> 00:12:47,811
bisexual,

457
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:51,530
etc. Similar to the concept
of Queer of gender queer.

458
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,040
Oh,

459
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,360
okay.

460
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,640
Gender.

461
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,473
Queers different.

462
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,470
Hmm.

463
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,490
What's Gender Queer?

464
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,331
I think that'd be like me.

465
00:12:56,331 --> 00:13:00,650
Like nonbinary don't fall under
the spectrum of male or female.

466
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,270
Gender Queer is a term which refers to
individuals or groups who are queer or

467
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,910
problematize what they're making,

468
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:08,780
a fake words,

469
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,360
hegemonic notions of sex,

470
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:11,751
gender,

471
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:12,411
and desire.

472
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,460
In a given society,

473
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:18,461
gender queer people possess identities
which fall outside of the widely accepted

474
00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:20,360
sexual binary.

475
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:20,931
You're not mine.

476
00:13:20,931 --> 00:13:21,410
Your area,

477
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,161
your gender queer,

478
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:22,640
Bro.

479
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:22,881
Yeah.

480
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:23,620
Gender Queer.

481
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,320
Jan Mueller may also refer to
people who identify as both trend,

482
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,080
gendered end queer.

483
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,920
I individuals who,

484
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,300
Huh?

485
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,170
This is a lot of work,

486
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:33,620
man.

487
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,180
That's a lot of work time.

488
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,370
This is what you do when
you don't chop firewood.

489
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,233
Yeah.

490
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,420
She was a fucking easy to get water.

491
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,660
It's too easy.

492
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,110
Just get bottled water too easy society.

493
00:13:45,111 --> 00:13:48,430
We have to invent all of these things
now and they didn't have taken that

494
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,030
Muskrat shit in my mouth.

495
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,060
This is a real hate mail episode.

496
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,740
We always bring the hate
the gender stuff this time.

497
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,960
You know what the real
gender stuff though.

498
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,650
No,

499
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,160
no,

500
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,580
no,

501
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,090
no.

502
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,840
The fake stuff.

503
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,051
No,

504
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,160
not the legit people.

505
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:04,581
They're like,

506
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:04,881
dude,

507
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:05,331
I'm a,

508
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:06,590
I'm a man trapped in a woman's,

509
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,690
but that I do obviously.

510
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:09,590
Right,

511
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,560
but just keep yourself,

512
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,560
take your weird shit.

513
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,720
That shit suppressors.

514
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,053
Exactly.

515
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,943
Persons good.

516
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,340
I'm telling you the 1950s not all bad.

517
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,731
No,

518
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,151
but you know,

519
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:23,491
there was,

520
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:24,230
keep on the right track.

521
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,570
Gender people pour in
the turn of the century,

522
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,680
the turn of the 20th century.

523
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,860
There's a lot of photos of
transgender people from back then.

524
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,910
It's always been a thing.

525
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,290
I used to see them more and in Hollywood
where I live there about 15 years ago,

526
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,850
I just don't buy the going back and forth.

527
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,410
Sorry.

528
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah,

529
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:38,871
I,

530
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:39,140
yeah.

531
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,590
I don't,

532
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,210
I don't think most most people do.

533
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,340
I think it's an attention seeking,

534
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,090
uh,

535
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,791
some something,

536
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,130
something else is going on there.

537
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,000
I think not all your feelings
should be acknowledged by agree.

538
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,190
That's important.

539
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,460
Right.

540
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,050
I agree.

541
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,883
That's important.

542
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,671
You like this.

543
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,050
The guy wants to be the six year old girl.

544
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:54,261
I mean,

545
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,960
they have all these specials on
him and now he's 57 years old.

546
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:57,794
I can't,

547
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,880
I can't,

548
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,000
they don't have specials on him
because he's an extraordinary story.

549
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,740
They have specials on
him because you know,

550
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,330
it's ridiculous and
you're going to watch it.

551
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,571
Yeah.

552
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,180
It's funny.

553
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,620
Yes.

554
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:06,980
Yeah.

555
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,490
It's weird.

556
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,690
Yeah.

557
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:07,770
You,

558
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,060
you'll let,

559
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,830
you can't go back in time.

560
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,761
Right.

561
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:12,050
You lived a long time.

562
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,000
You have to be responsible.

563
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,120
You have a special on him.

564
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,730
The same reason they have a special on
a lady who doesn't cut her toenails.

565
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,213
Like,

566
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,740
these are my special name.

567
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:26,300
It's so true and I can't get a job.

568
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,740
Right.

569
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,020
Right.

570
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,340
And they can never get a job.

571
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:29,650
That's the downer.

572
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,060
Nowadays,

573
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,920
people are employable.

574
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,830
That is the one common denominator.

575
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:42,850
Okay.
