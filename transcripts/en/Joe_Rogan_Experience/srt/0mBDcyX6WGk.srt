1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,890
What is that a record for?
Consecutive ones.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:03,990
20 some?

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,250
Yes.
We live campaigns.

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,310
Flip that sucker over.
She don't get in distraction.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:14,920
Oh,
sorry.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,753
See,
that's what I had jet already checked 

7
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:18,274
in.
This motherfucker is right in the other 

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,130
room.
He's got a texture.

9
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,680
Make sure you sort of loose.
Make sure we were.

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,620
We just got back from an epic El con in 
the mountains.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,990
We did.
That was.

12
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,430
Epic is the right word.
You know,

13
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,890
I think people throw around epic a 
little loosely.

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,860
They do it this time.
Not this time now.

15
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,060
No,
man.

16
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,110
It was amazing.
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,040
First of all,
the place was incredible.

18
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,370
The mountains up there,
which is the scenery was just stunning.

19
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:44,350
Like everywhere you look,
your jaws dropped.

20
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,920
Like whoa.
He has amazing everything about it.

21
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,893
Yeah,
I mean but,

22
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,260
but especially the scenery,
the mountains that they live in there,

23
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,840
they're rugged,
they're beautiful.

24
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,970
And you know,
the quakers haven't even turned yet.

25
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,030
Normally it seems like by this time 
they're at.

26
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:03,550
That's all yellow.
Like all those white trees.

27
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,600
Yeah.
The aspens.

28
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,141
Yeah.
Why?

29
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:08,770
Why do you call him quickies?
Why does the quaking aspens quaking?

30
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:09,604
Aspen?
I've never heard them called quickies 

31
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:13,510
until this past weekend or this past 
week.

32
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,890
Rather.
Everybody's calling quakers and like,

33
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,120
what are you guys talking about?
Yeah,

34
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,480
that's a photo that I took from up 
there.

35
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,450
Fuck man.
Everywhere we look.

36
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,463
It was just like there was too many 
moments with elk that I couldn't film 

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,233
because it was just.
I was just so engrossed in the idea of 

38
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,084
like getting it done and the hunting 
aspect of it that I didn't want to pull 

39
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:34,210
my phone out and be taken pictures in 
five minutes.

40
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,620
I did the tourist.
Yeah,

41
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:36,454
I took a few here and there,
but there were so many moments that I'm 

42
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,830
so glad that under armour filmed this 
whole thing.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,840
Yeah.
So we're going to have a film of it.

44
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,683
The.
It's going to be released online so 

45
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:46,804
people are going to get a chance to 
check out how just incredible and epic 

46
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,344
and maybe just get a tiny sense of what 
we talk about when we talk about how 

47
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,310
amazing it is to do this.
Yeah,

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,810
and we had the right guys filming it 
because,

49
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,763
you know,
there's all sorts of different levels 

50
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:01,840
of,
especially hunting films.

51
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:03,700
I mean there's guys out there just with 
a handicap,

52
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,763
you know,
just trying to do the best I can to 

53
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,304
share their experience.
And then there's guys like mark womack 

54
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,910
and his crew with sub seven that make 
films.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,640
I mean,
you know,

56
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:16,240
he's filling me.
Um,

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,533
there's an episode called Roy's Buck,
a whitetail hunting Colorado the time 

58
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,230
episode time.
Yeah,

59
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,180
that one's amazing time.
That's really good.

60
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:28,120
Oregon el Con.
And so those are not just your typical,

61
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,040
what people might think of as a hunting 
film.

62
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,630
Those were just,
you know,

63
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,760
or hunting video.
These are true films.

64
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,940
Well,
it's a short film and it,

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,873
it's really like almost like a mini 
documentary of how you're trying to 

66
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:40,804
balance your life and training and 
running and competing these ultra 

67
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:44,764
marathons and then also working a full 
time job and then also going out and go 

68
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,011
on it.
I mean it's,

69
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,520
it's,
uh,

70
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,530
it's really well done.
So those same guys filmed us.

71
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,720
Yeah,
man,

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,220
we got some epic footage.
Just epic.

73
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,330
Yeah.
And,

74
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,070
and like you hopefully gives

75
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,760
a glimpse for people that haven't 
experienced at or aren't hunters.

76
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,603
Maybe just to see I'm at everything 
that's involved in the hunt and you 

77
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,980
know,
how powerful it is and,

78
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:10,814
and just to add the wild animals out 
there interacting with each other and 

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,950
then how we fit in that.
It's crazy.

80
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,903
It is.

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,673
It's one of those things that I really 
think are words like people will be 

82
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:28,000
intrigued by the words,
but I don't think we're ever going to be

83
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,834
able to put it in their head what we 
experienced because there was one point 

84
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:33,724
in time where Jamison,
Colton and I were together in the woods 

85
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
and uh,
I just stopped and as we were walking 

86
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,300
towards his elk that was screaming and 
screaming,

87
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,134
alc all around us.
And you hear these cow elk that are 

88
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,014
making it

89
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,930
and screaming is bugling screaming.
We call it screaming.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,150
But there is,
it's a,

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,280
it's part of the mating ritual basically
of a male elk bugling in it.

92
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,040
We call it screaming because it's just 
like,

93
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,260
it's like going,
there's a little higher,

94
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:08,490
a couple higher notes in there.
But yeah.

95
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,740
Well,
some of them are like that,

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,510
some of them have a growl to it,
starts deep,

97
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,700
it goes high,
usually comes back deep.

98
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,130
And then the grants,
we heard

99
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,070
the one bull that I wound up killing 
that sounded like Jurassic Park.

100
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,163
And it was a crazy scene because jamison
and I'm Colton and I were talked into 

101
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,043
Jamieson was the guy was filming at 
Colton was the guide and me and were 

102
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,410
tucked into this one small area,
this,

103
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,323
these trees that was at the edge of this
creek and we were watching these dose 

104
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,560
and we saw three dose.
So we knew and there's a lesson in this.

105
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,400
I said,
Dale,

106
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,900
I said those cows,
sorry,

107
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,980
wrong terminology.
Um,

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,833
there's a lesson in this for regular 
people for life and this is the lesson 

109
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,790
in life because we saw these cows and we
snuck in and we were like,

110
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
wow,
there's got to be a bull here because 

111
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:58,630
there's like three cows.
And we saw three

112
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,700
one more time a year.
There's no cows unattended.

113
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,540
So there was 30 cows,
the cows cap file and in.

114
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,130
And we were like,
where is this bowl?

115
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,140
Like where is he?
And all of a sudden out of the creek,

116
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:14,141
bottom steam coming out of his mouth are
away 60,

117
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:16,830
70 yards.
Some point,

118
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,460
like through the trees and couldn't end 
up screwed.

119
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:21,740
The bugling is deafening.
It feels like at that,

120
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,360
at that distance.
So close.

121
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,760
So loud.
And he was just letting everybody know.

122
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,500
Yeah,
don't fuck up.

123
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

124
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,240
I mean it's like a grand entrance.
So this gives you chills,

125
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,920
doesn't it?
Oh yeah.

126
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,210
But this is the less.
Okay.

127
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,920
There was one cow.
He had 30 cows.

128
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,330
Yeah.
And one cows.

129
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,460
Like I didn't want to be here.
I'm tired of being number three.

130
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,294
There's always wanted this and she takes
off and he could not just be satisfied 

131
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,950
with this.
Thirty nine.

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,720
I think he had more than 30.
It was so hard to count.

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,583
There were everywhere,
but he could not be satisfied with the 

134
00:05:56,531 --> 00:05:57,440
cows.
He left.

135
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:57,771
He's like,
no,

136
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,030
no,
no,

137
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,280
no,
no,

138
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,821
no.
Where are you going?

139
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,654
Baby?
And went chasing after her and when he 

140
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,624
went chasing after her,
these other cows that were left behind 

141
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:09,560
started going.
They make this noise like they want some

142
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,600
Dick.
And when that was happening,

143
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,540
this other bull behind us was like,
oh,

144
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,080
felt that bill.
I'm the man for you girls.

145
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:18,970
Yeah,
well what?

146
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,510
Fuck that dude.
I'm right here.

147
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,880
So he started screaming and then the 
other bolts started screaming.

148
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,953
So he decided it's too much.
And so he takes all of his cows and he 

149
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,430
moves them over the top of the hill.

150
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,440
When he moved him over the top of the 
hill,

151
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,380
we went after him and when we went after
him,

152
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,590
he turned around because he thought we 
were that other bull.

153
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,300
He heard you.
He heard us walking.

154
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,680
Yeah.
So there's the thinking here.

155
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,543
I'm sure he just thought it was the bull
coming hurt their sticks breaking in 

156
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,860
footfalls and things like that.
Yeah.

157
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,750
And that's how he gone.
Um,

158
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,783
yeah.
So if he just let that girl go get out 

159
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:53,060
of here baby.
So let's a lesson.

160
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,370
The lesson is you got to let things go 
sometimes.

161
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,233
Oh,
is that a 30 cows and one of them takes 

162
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,810
off?
Or you might take an arrow in the chest.

163
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,840
You might.
Yeah.

164
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,450
Yeah.
Let him go,

165
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,930
I'm going to jot that down.
And actually it's a very strong lesson.

166
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,690
It's a lesson for life.
Like sometimes you can't be greedy.

167
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,840
He got greedy and when we probably got 
them anyway,

168
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,030
but he got greedy.
It's tough.

169
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,930
You know,
those things,

170
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,900
they only have one thing on their mind 
and that's breeding,

171
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,970
you know,
so there is no,

172
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,590
uh,
29 is good enough,

173
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,090
you know,
if we're rough numbers,

174
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:23,924
but let that one go.
They're fighting for everything they 

175
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,960
got,
you know,

176
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:27,950
and it's,
you know,

177
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,110
we did see bulls fighting,
um,

178
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,310
you know,
it's uh,

179
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,530
we see the,
the,

180
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,410
the big herd bulls posturing,
you know,

181
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:41,090
so there bugling they get Kinda swole up
sometimes if they're uh,

182
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,010
you know,
if there's a subordinate bowl,

183
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,940
they'll kind of walk a little sideways 
to say see how big I am.

184
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,774
I mean,
is all of this is body language that 

185
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,950
goes on with these elk,
but it's what they do.

186
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,120
That's all they care about right now.
When we were cutting the bull open,

187
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,160
he had cuts and holes all over his rib 
cage and his ass,

188
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,360
like everywhere marks from fighting like
a couple of the skin.

189
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,490
You see all this like punctures.
Yup.

190
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,890
Yup.
Their antlers are uh,

191
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,010
I mean,
and they're big and big solid muscle.

192
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,440
I'm eight,
900 pound animals.

193
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,240
Barely any fat living in the mountains 
in.

194
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,163
And you know how tough those mountains 
were to get around in their everyday 

195
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,110
sleeping on dirt.
Tough,

196
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,930
strong and fighting and yeah,
they get beat up.

197
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,210
Yeah.
I mean sort of what a crazy existence to

198
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:32,750
that for one month out of the year,
everything goes haywire.

199
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,870
Everything's going to f your friends.
Are you now your enemies.

200
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,913
You're ready to fight to the death with 
guys who were just hanging out with a 

201
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,710
couple of weeks.
Summer.

202
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,910
All summer.
All summer.

203
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,803
Yeah.
You weren't at the lake but you were 

204
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,040
hanging out at the lake,
but you guys are eating grass.

205
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,123
We're just looking out for wolves,
but actually they don't have walls up 

206
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,311
there.
Well,

207
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,260
they had a wolf came through real 
recently.

208
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,940
Rather.
There's a lot of bears,

209
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,953
but they don't have a ton of predators,
which is one reason why the elk are 

210
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:59,580
doing so well up there.
It was incredible.

211
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I've never seen so many elk in one 
place,

212
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,730
like you had told me about it,
but when you get there and you hear them

213
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
all screaming,
we heard 100 different elks screaming in

214
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,340
this one basin.
Yeah,

215
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,471
yeah.
Oh,

216
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,740
I mean it's a,
it's unlike anything I've ever heard.

217
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,020
And I've.
Elk hunted a lot of different places and

218
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,290
that's the,
you know,

219
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,870
if you.
And I said,

220
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,820
if you're an elk hunter,
I said one morning,

221
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,490
I think it was the morning that it was 
snowing and we were in on bowls,

222
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,370
you know,
crazy red activity,

223
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:31,740
amazing footage.
I'm cold,

224
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:35,250
Wet El Camino and I said,
told Mark,

225
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,950
and the guy said,
if you're an ell connor,

226
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,540
this is as good as it gets.

227
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,770
I mean,
it's,

228
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,080
you couldn't,
couldn't be any better.

229
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,981
No,
it was.

230
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,410
The terrain was beautiful.
The weather was beautiful.

231
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:51,411
There was one time where we had snuck up
to this one bull and he was younger.

232
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,130
He was still a big bull,
but he was.

233
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,310
You wanted to shoot every of the ranch 
where we were at.

234
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,460
They were really smart in how they 
manage the wildlife.

235
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,313
Yeah,
and one of the things they do is you're 

236
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,940
supposed to only kill an animal that's 
over eight years old.

237
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,020
Eight years or older.
Yeah.

238
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,240
So that way they've had many,
many,

239
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,480
many years to breed.
They're really like,

240
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,460
they're in the later years of their 
life.

241
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,520
Like how,
how long does an elk live in the wild?

242
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,700
This it's lucky.
They thought that the bull I killed last

243
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,550
year was 15,
but that's rare.

244
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,850
That's crazy to me.
At a 10 year old bull was old,

245
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,100
so they figured out eight.

246
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,870
Then it starts going downhill,
so it's,

247
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,763
it's been past its prime that's past its
prime and that's passed this breeding 

248
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,140
prime.
So that's when you want to take it out.

249
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,123
Yeah.
Colton said that mine was between eight 

250
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,490
and a half and nine and a half.
He didn't.

251
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,550
They're trying to get specific and I 
guess they have to take the jaw and send

252
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,730
it to a biologist.
Yep.

253
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,930
Teeth were and things like that.
So the,

254
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,990
the estimate was eight and a half to 
nine and a half years old.

255
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:52,470
It's an old bull.
It's an old bull,

256
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,390
but yeah,
the tank this up.

257
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,900
So that property,
it's about a quarter million acres,

258
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:58,734
250,000
acres and they figured there's almost 

259
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,130
3000 elk,
you know,

260
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,730
and that's actually a little bit more 
than optimum,

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,090
a carrying capacity for that amount of 
property,

262
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,640
that many l.
So they'd like to get that number down a

263
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,680
little bit and just increase the habitat
and,

264
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,810
and the elk herd health.

265
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,060
But uh,
did they ever think about capturing some

266
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,740
of those.
I know the Rocky Mountain Elk Federation

267
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:23,250
does that.
Is it a rocky mountain elk foundation?

268
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,084
What does foundation they,
they capture them and then they'll 

269
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,264
release them to places like Kentucky and
they've sort of reestablished like a 

270
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:32,960
real herd there now.
So for people,

271
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,823
for people that don't know,
at one point in time elk were 

272
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,073
essentially all over the United States.
But then Europeans came and then market 

273
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,930
hunting came and of course we had rifles
and it's not we,

274
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,220
we didn't do it.
They're people,

275
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,340
people that are like us out of hippo.
Yeah.

276
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,190
But they,
the market hunters essentially almost

277
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,390
wiped out the elk and at the turn of the
century there are very few elg,

278
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,224
very few deer.
And then they had established some 

279
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:06,751
protocols and some wildlife conservation
ideas in place in order to try to revive

280
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,344
them.
They've done an amazing job since then 

281
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,880
and now kind of foundations like the 
rocky mountain elk foundation.

282
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,550
What they've done is move elk into areas
where they had been extricated.

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,850
So they were.
They had been driven out of the area,

284
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,310
essentially extinct,
extinct in this one particular region.

285
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,830
And now they have healthy populations.
They're hunting.

286
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,270
Yeah,
I mean they got enough to where they can

287
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,550
manage them.
Pennsylvania has a lot of elk now.

288
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,810
Big Bulls there.
Yeah,

289
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,280
I've seen them on,
on,

290
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,260
on the Internet.
A lot of.

291
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,110
Yeah.

292
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,980
No.
And it's,

293
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,733
you know,
we talk about this every time about 

294
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:41,720
hunters and conservation and the rocky 
mountain elk foundation,

295
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:42,554
but those are the groups that have 
fought to protect elk and elk habitat 

296
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,280
and that's why they're doing so well.
But so I think,

297
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,280
in fact,
here's a gratuitous crotch shot.

298
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
Let me see that.
Oh,

299
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:54,794
that's a rocky mountain elk foundation.
Steps back a little bit so people could 

300
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,550
see the glory.
That is your belt buckle.

301
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,010
That is my belt buckle.

302
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Yeah.
So that they've done an amazing job.

303
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,423
And then obviously there's companies 
that have other foundations that have 

304
00:13:11,971 --> 00:13:15,570
done an amazing job for waterfowl and 
protecting wetlands.

305
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,493
And then for white tails,
I mean there's more white tail deer in 

306
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,230
America today than the war when Columbus
came,

307
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,060
that's what most people hunt is,
is white tail too,

308
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:30,061
because they're in eastern southern us.
You now were elk are mostly out west,

309
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,950
but they are moving back east again.
But yeah,

310
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:33,784
most,
most hunters are white tail hunters and 

311
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:35,700
uh,
those,

312
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,600
those,
that animal's doing amazing.

313
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,250
Yeah.
I mean so amazing.

314
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,400
So that they actually have to hire 
people to kill them in some places where

315
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:46,210
they get too close to urban environments
and they have a ton of car accidents.

316
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,000
There are some states,
and God,

317
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,863
I wish I could,
I don't know every state and in the bag 

318
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:51,900
limits,
but uh,

319
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,580
I'm thinking Alabama or somewhere down 
in there where he can kill a deer a day,

320
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,490
as many as you want.
There's no predators.

321
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,120
There's no winter so that these animals 
aren't dying on their own.

322
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,370
So I mean we just don't have unlimited 
habitat because humans take up space.

323
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,680
So down there at the back and limit is a
deer a day.

324
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,930
Wow.
And I don't know if it's Alabama,

325
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:14,190
so don't,
don't quote me on that,

326
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:15,480
but that's one of those states.
Yeah.

327
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,320
Yeah.

328
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,153
I think they have something like that 
similar in some parts of Pennsylvania 

329
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,280
and New Jersey where they're in the 
suburban areas.

330
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,290
I was watching a television show about 
it.

331
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:29,520
I think it was one of those reality 
shows where they hired people to come in

332
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,600
to hunt in suburban neighborhoods.
Yeah.

333
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,643
Yeah.
I've,

334
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,550
I've seen something about that too.
She's not back.

335
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

336
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,180
Well,
I saw an episode of a show the other day

337
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,450
with t bone was doing that.
T boned.

338
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,720
Turner was shooting.
Uh,

339
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,600
I love Tivo and he's a great guy.
Yeah.

340
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,453
He's shooting deer in this backyard in 
between an above ground swimming pool 

341
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,490
and swing set.
He shot a deer.

342
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,210
Yeah.
It was a swing movie.

343
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,530
No,
because here's a good shot.

344
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,040
Yeah,
sure.

345
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,983
Yeah.
He's,

346
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,281
yeah.
Time at.

347
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:04,750
That'd be kind of fun to.
Million car accidents happen every year.

348
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,210
Just in North America with deer.
Yeah.

349
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:10,930
I'm sure at 150 people die every year in
car accidents.

350
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,090
Wasn't there a guy that died in your 
neighborhood?

351
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,933
Yeah,
a deer went through a windshield of a 

352
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:20,380
van or something like that,
and a right in Eugene.

353
00:15:20,381 --> 00:15:23,500
There.
Didn't like hit the car in front of it,

354
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,630
hit it,
and then it flew into his.

355
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,640
I don't know now.
I can't remember the.

356
00:15:27,641 --> 00:15:29,360
Do you think that's what you told me?
Yeah,

357
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,300
but it happens a lot.
Yeah,

358
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,290
it does.
I mean it's,

359
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,293
that's the.
There's always that balance of a animal 

360
00:15:35,981 --> 00:15:39,610
numbers and habitat and where we live 
and making it all work.

361
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,683
Yeah,
and that's where people get super 

362
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,480
emotional.
People get very emotional about animals,

363
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
you know?
I mean,

364
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,500
what does this whoa buck deer crashes 
through suv?

365
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,120
Wouldn't she'll drive or hurt?
Yeah,

366
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:50,000
that.
That's crazy.

367
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,880
He didn't even do that guy didn't die.
Apparently.

368
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:53,940
He just got hurt.
Yeah.

369
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,850
That is crazy.
That looks like a mule deer.

370
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,140
It's a big,
big deer.

371
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,760
Yeah.
Come flying through your windshield.

372
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,560
Yeah.
People get sued

373
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,810
promotional about this.
This is one of those subjects wherever,

374
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:05,644
whenever we're talking about hunting,
like there's one way that we normally 

375
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:10,264
talk about it when it's just like you 
and I or maybe some other hunters when 

376
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,014
we talk about how great it is,
how much we love and how great the meat 

377
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:17,254
is,
and then there's a way that you talk 

378
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:22,600
about it in public where you have to 
sort of temper that knowing that there's

379
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:23,434
a bunch of people that are listening 
that are going to get very emotional 

380
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:29,830
that are maybe anti hunters and some of 
them where it gets really weird.

381
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,353
Also eat meat.

382
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,720
Yeah,
I got,

383
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,380
you know,
I,

384
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm,
I'm a sucker.

385
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:38,220
I read the comments on social media and 
it's like,

386
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,630
you tell me,
don't read them,

387
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,310
but I think you do too.
But anyway,

388
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,573
and there's just some people.
It's like I saw one today and I think 

389
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:50,910
you mentioned that I was going to be on.
Somebody said something like Joe for his

390
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,440
whatever.
I can't remember it.

391
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,140
Intelligent or in tune or something.
You are,

392
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,590
I can't believe you hunt,
you know,

393
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,433
or whatever.
It's just like check that dude's 

394
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:01,970
instagram for a cheeseburger.
Yeah.

395
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,070
I check to see if he's got a cat,
but he's feeding murdered animals too.

396
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,960
To me,
I think if you are in tune with actually

397
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,960
how the world and nature in,
in how we live and what we need it,

398
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,040
the more in tune you are,
the more accepting you are of hunting.

399
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,940
Not,
not the more you,

400
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,960
you slide it because it's how it works.
It's how it's how we survive.

401
00:17:24,781 --> 00:17:25,830
It's,
you know,

402
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,610
life eats life and it's just like,
it seems weird for people to think that,

403
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:30,050
oh,
I'm,

404
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,230
I'm evolved past that and I'm smarter,
more intelligent and urine neanderthal.

405
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,120
It's just,
it's opposite really

406
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,580
well what they're trying to do and I 
understand it and I appreciate it.

407
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,473
What they're trying to do is move past 
the idea that we have to be cruel and 

408
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:48,364
that we have to kill animals and that we
have to live off the suffering of other 

409
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,830
living creatures in our survive.
So this is like the Vegan idea,

410
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:58,830
right?
So what they want to do is live off only

411
00:17:58,831 --> 00:17:59,664
plants

412
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,293
and you know,
and not participate at all in any sort 

413
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,520
of slaughter of animals or any sort of 
cruelty.

414
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:10,450
And in theory,
it's a great idea.

415
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,150
It's a great idea because nobody wants 
to be cruel,

416
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,370
vicious.
I don't like to be her.

417
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,470
I don't want.
My goal isn't to be cruel.

418
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,530
I don't like seeing animals suffer,
right?

419
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,460
That's the worst thing in my life is to 
see an animal suffer,

420
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:23,294
which sounds very contradictory.
Coming from a guy who killed a lot of 

421
00:18:25,391 --> 00:18:26,920
animals,
a hundred percent true.

422
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,570
I mean I don't,
I don't enjoy it.

423
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,000
If the animal suffers,
I feel bad.

424
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,190
Right?
But if it's okay,

425
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,083
clean kill,
it's better than anything that animal's 

426
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:39,070
going to get in the wild,
in the wild,

427
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,900
that animal's going to die either by 
freezing to death or being torn apart by

428
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,823
predators because it's old or it's going
to get injured and it's going to get 

429
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,980
torn apart.
Antler,

430
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:47,843
I found a dead bull last year that took 
an hour in the neck from fighting and 

431
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,750
who knows how long it took to bleed out.
You know,

432
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,030
maybe it broke its neck,
maybe it was paralyzed and it laid there

433
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,750
and it took days to die.
But a hunter and what I do,

434
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,920
the term I like to use is being 
merciful.

435
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I want to be ethical,
quick and merciful when I kill an animal

436
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,980
because that's a 100 percent the 
opposite of how nature works.

437
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,300
Well,
this is one thing that you have

438
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,210
said to me in private when we've talked 
about it,

439
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,810
you know,
we were saying that what you trained for

440
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,913
and what you strive for is so that in 
that moment you can make the most 

441
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:26,384
precise shot and killed that animal as 
quickly and as ethically and as 

442
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,470
efficiently as possible,
and that,

443
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,920
that sounds that's on your mind every 
time you release an arrow

444
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,880
every time.
Yeah.

445
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,790
And yeah,
so I just think people.

446
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,640
I know it's hard to understand.
I get it.

447
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,474
If you haven't hunted and you haven't 
been in the mountains and you haven't 

448
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:48,030
seen how cruel nature can actually be,
it's,

449
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,070
it's hard to comprehend.
Yeah,

450
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:50,840
it is,
is,

451
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,110
and it's also the reason why human 
beings are today,

452
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,930
are here today.
The reason why we survived is because of

453
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:57,764
hunting.
Does it mean that you can't be a 

454
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,890
vegetarian,
can't go vegan or.

455
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,520
No?
It doesn't.

456
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,353
You can do whatever you want to do,
but the reason why human beings have 

457
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,960
made it to the top of the food chain is 
because we consumed animals.

458
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,123
It's one of the primary reasons that 
biologists believe that our brains 

459
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:17,330
evolved past that have lower primates.
We figured out fire,

460
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,403
we figured out how to cook meat and the 
nutrients from that cookie meet along 

461
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:22,184
with the complex problem solving issues 
that come up and hunting and one of the 

462
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:27,524
reasons why we evolve because to be 
smarter and more clever than these 

463
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:33,370
animals that are faster than you,
smell better than you here,

464
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,730
better than you see,
better than you,

465
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:35,630
stronger than you.

466
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,880
They have more endurance.
Knew these elk,

467
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:39,950
run up that mountain.
Like it's a joke.

468
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,173
I was huffing and puffing.
I mean I've been running a lot since we 

469
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,170
did that.
Um,

470
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,003
your keep hammering five k last year and
I realized what a pussy and then the 

471
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,043
times that we've hunted together too,
I've just been really out of breath and 

472
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,920
even though I work out,
do another things,

473
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,990
I realized I have to run hills.
So there's no way around it.

474
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,230
So it helped me a lot.
That was very nice to see.

475
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,580
It was very nice to see a big difference
in my endurance now where I can keep up.

476
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,450
Whereas before it was like a huge 
struggle because every day we were doing

477
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:11,830
10,
12 miles,

478
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,950
but these health go up there like 
nothing.

479
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,063
It's nothing so for a human at one point
in our evolutionary past to figure out 

480
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,830
how to beat these things at their own 
game,

481
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:28,600
trick them and get meat from them and 
survive and then develop strategies,

482
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,463
strategies for that and then teach other
people in their community these 

483
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:32,404
strategies and this evolved and this is 
the reason why you and I are talking 

484
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,694
today on microphones that are powered by
electricity that in this room that's 

485
00:21:39,571 --> 00:21:40,404
shelter in this city,
this complex series of buildings that 

486
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:47,920
we've built a lot to protect us from the
environment and from other animals.

487
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,731
Yeah,
yeah,

488
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:48,930
yeah.

489
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,763
It's,
it's been quite a journey and the part 

490
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:53,630
of that.
So yeah,

491
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:54,650
we have evolved.
Yes,

492
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:55,484
we've got better and we are.
That's why we're different than an elk 

493
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,540
and other animals.
That's.

494
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,510
And we take advantage of that 
superiority and we use it to kill them,

495
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,700
to eat them,
to hold them at home.

496
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,430
But I just,
for me,

497
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,400
it's,
you know,

498
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,580
if it was about the killing,
just killing,

499
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,460
I wouldn't bow hunting.
Bow Hunting is very hard.

500
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,463
Um,
I would rifle hunt if I just want to go 

501
00:22:18,661 --> 00:22:19,970
out there and kill something that would 
be,

502
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,790
that's usually the most efficient way to
get it.

503
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,040
Kills you.
So maybe 10 times easier,

504
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,920
I don't know.
But with a bow I just know how difficult

505
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:28,550
it is.
And,

506
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,770
and you know,
you talked about the improvements you've

507
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,960
made.
He'd been bow hunting now for four years

508
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,740
and um,
I just wanted,

509
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,430
I do want to touch on,
um,

510
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:42,070
it's been awesome to see the dedication 
you have to the craft of bowhunting.

511
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,630
It is not easy.
I mean,

512
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,450
I know people who don't hunt see it and 
say,

513
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:48,284
oh,
you just enjoy killing animals out 

514
00:22:49,521 --> 00:22:50,271
there.
I just said if I,

515
00:22:50,271 --> 00:22:51,260
if I just want to kill,
I'd,

516
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,970
I'd use a gun.
It's,

517
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,893
it is about the challenge about the 
experience and it's not easy and the 

518
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,640
improvements you've made in four years 
and it's basically through obsession.

519
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,530
I mean,
to be great at anything,

520
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:05,930
you need to be slightly obsessed.
And you have been,

521
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,270
but that learning curve for hunting is 
so steep is sometimes people,

522
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,253
you know,
because of how we've talked and you 

523
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,410
know,
the,

524
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,360
the stories we've shared on social 
media,

525
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,310
it looks intriguing.
It looks,

526
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,110
um,
I don't know,

527
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,460
I mean it's just,
it's powerful.

528
00:23:22,461 --> 00:23:24,110
So people,
they want a piece of that.

529
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,740
They want to know what that feels like 
to be ingrained in that world.

530
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,290
And you know,
we get messages,

531
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,124
Hey,
I want to get started in bowhunting and 

532
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,740
part of me is going,
God,

533
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,010
I want you to.
But it's a long journey.

534
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,350
It is hard.
That's almost too much.

535
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,383
It's not too much.
I don't want to discourage anybody but 

536
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,210
God,
it's tough.

537
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,830
I mean,
just good enough.

538
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,710
Listen,
I've been doing this for almost 30 years

539
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:49,730
now.
Nineteen 89.

540
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:52,220
I killed my first bull.
Elk is a spike bull.

541
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,863
And so since 1989,
so this is 29 years of bowhunting and I 

542
00:23:57,141 --> 00:23:57,974
go into this season just like I go into 
every season and I wonder is this going 

543
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,180
to be the season where I don't get any 
kid?

544
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,570
I have no success because it could 
happen.

545
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,973
It's that hard because I've killed 
before and had success for all these 

546
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:12,590
years.
Doesn't mean anything right now.

547
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,460
Doesn't mean anything to an animal that 
I was pursuing it in Utah,

548
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:18,590
a big bull,
that big bulk of care.

549
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,030
Less about.
Oh,

550
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,930
you know,
oh,

551
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,660
he's had a lot of success over the years
means nothing,

552
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:24,643
you know,
and like,

553
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,380
so I always wonder is this gonna be the 
year where I can't get it done?

554
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,483
And it completely changes your 
relationship to your food because all 

555
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:34,910
your meat that you're getting in your 
house is coming from your success.

556
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,833
Bowhunting.
Yeah.

557
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,683
So when you are entering into a season 
and you're wondering whether or not 

558
00:24:40,191 --> 00:24:41,024
you're going to get success,
you are literally worrying whether or 

559
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:46,580
not you're going to be able to provide 
for your family the way you have been.

560
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,920
And it's not like we're starving.
Right.

561
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,540
Okay.
So this is the way you've chosen to meet

562
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,910
though,
and this ethical,

563
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,710
humane,
wild way.

564
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,590
One of my family goes to the freezer and
opens it.

565
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,950
There's always elk meat in there.
Always.

566
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,650
That's what I do.
I make sure we have,

567
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,543
my family has meat to eat,
so when they go to the freezer and open 

568
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:10,520
it and there's no elk meat,
that's not good.

569
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,421
I mean,
yeah,

570
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,940
we're not going to starve,
but that's what we're used to.

571
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,220
That's,
that's I've provided like that.

572
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,250
My family,
friends and family have called,

573
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,440
Hey,
you got any elk meat you could spare.

574
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,760
Got Any hamburger,
you know,

575
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:24,050
whatever.
Always.

576
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,860
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

577
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,580
Love to.
That's,

578
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,000
that's what I love to do.
So I don't want the.

579
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,340
I don't want him to face the prospect of
not having that.

580
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,300
Right.
Yeah.

581
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,460
I give away a lot of it.
I'm constantly giving it to Brian Cowen.

582
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,610
Yeah.
Brian.

583
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,453
And to get back on the horse,
he hasn't had any success haunting in a 

584
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,800
couple of years.
So he mooches off me.

585
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,490
Did he?
He's killed then.

586
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,870
Yeah.
He's got a few deer.

587
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,550
Oh,
okay.

588
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,750
All right.
He's never shot a bow before.

589
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,610
Um,
but he's rifle hunted.

590
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,040
I figured that's why he was so ripped 
his from all that,

591
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,690
that a lean meat meat,
lean protein because he's,

592
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,120
he is a beautiful man.
He's beautiful.

593
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,201
Um,
yeah.

594
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,034
He wants to get into bow hunting,
but it's another one of those things 

595
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:03,620
like,
you know,

596
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,570
you say you do,
but do you really,

597
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,950
you know,
because if you do,

598
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,850
it's going to take it all in and you 
can't go halfway.

599
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,243
No.
And,

600
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,350
and there's another thing that people 
love to say,

601
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,410
you know that meat is terrible for you 
and you're going to get cancer and heart

602
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,930
attacks and diabetes.
People keep repeating that.

603
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,620
Stop saying it because it's not true.
You're wrong.

604
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,573
I know you like to say that because it 
sounds good and it sounds like a really 

605
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,810
good argument for people that eat meat.
It's absolutely untrue.

606
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:35,150
And if you go back and look at the real 
studies,

607
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,373
the only thing that they've shown is 
there's a connection between cancer and 

608
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:40,454
processed food.
There is a connection between 

609
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,100
preservatives,
nitrites

610
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,490
and a lot of the things that we use to 
make processed meat.

611
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,533
So if you're talking about things like 
hot dogs and processed meats and you 

612
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,560
know,
kind of like beef sticks,

613
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:56,520
you might get at the gas station.
Yeah,

614
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,220
eat enough of those and your body's 
going to revolt.

615
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,203
It's not good for you,
but wild game meat is some of the most 

616
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:04,554
nutritious and healthy things that you 
can put in your body and that's just a 

617
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:12,420
fact and so people that keep putting 
these comments on campaigns,

618
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:15,180
his instagram page and occasionally on 
mine and all these different,

619
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,733
they always want to say this,
Kay k nutrients are good luck with your 

620
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,503
heart.
It's not true in every study that has 

621
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:22,854
shown that it is true is bullshit.
They've all been debunked by actual 

622
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:26,964
science.
If you look at the real people that are 

623
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:32,070
putting together these documentaries 
that show that meat causes diabetes,

624
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,560
they are fools and it's not true.

625
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,820
It's been widely debunked.
What they are as proselytizing vegans,

626
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,913
they're vegans who want everyone to 
become vegan so they are distorting 

627
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,493
truth and making documentaries that have
no basis in actual reality and science 

628
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,540
and if you just google like it was the 
most recent one.

629
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,750
Those guys did the hell yeah.
What the health.

630
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,490
Google what the health debunked and 
there's a ton of scientists that have no

631
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:02,880
stake in the game.
They're not like from the meat industry.

632
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,410
They're just people that have seen,
the doctors have reviewed it.

633
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,573
There's people that have seen the actual
facts and seeing this documentary and 

634
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,810
go,
this is nonsense.

635
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,090
And so people regurgitate that stuff all
the time.

636
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,330
I just want to tell people like,
go,

637
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,610
just do some research,
read some of the actual studies.

638
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,590
Here's,
here's what's bad for you.

639
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,160
A sedentary lifestyle,
sedentary lifestyles,

640
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
terrible for you,
sitting in your office chair,

641
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,330
one sitting in a cubicle,
eating too much bad for you.

642
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,300
High carbohydrate diets,
bad for getting too fat,

643
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,040
bad for you,
drinking a lot of alcohol,

644
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,990
bad for drinking,
sugary sodas,

645
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,033
bad for you.
All those things are way worse for you 

646
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,760
than an elk stake.
Way Worse.

647
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,833
So if you're eating any of those things 
or doing any of those things and you 

648
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,080
say,
good luck with your hood,

649
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,140
took fuck off because you don't know 
what you're talking about.

650
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,400
Yeah,
it's true.

651
00:28:51,401 --> 00:28:52,610
And I,
uh,

652
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,150
since we're central talking about one 
thing that I get,

653
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,370
I think we have to be careful on is a 
slamming,

654
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,600
I guess the,
uh,

655
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,160
the beef industry because I'm not,
we're not trying to do that.

656
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,240
You know,
people always say,

657
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,783
you know,
there's cattle ranchers out there that 

658
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:10,930
work hard,
that it right.

659
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,793
And you know,
there is factory farming which people I 

660
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:14,904
feel like almost,
I've been guilty of it maybe thrown 

661
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:18,604
around factory farming,
almost like a Vegan will throw around 

662
00:29:20,571 --> 00:29:24,160
and good luck with that heart attack.
And they're most,

663
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,970
there's a lot of ranches that do it 
right that have the cattle out there,

664
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:28,804
free ranging and the only time that 
they're there in a small enclosure is 

665
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:33,430
when they are killed.
Slaughter.

666
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,211
Yeah.
Brought to slaughter.

667
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:35,510
So I mean,
um,

668
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,610
you know,
I buy,

669
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,650
I buy steaks still occasionally from my 
buddy at e three.

670
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,180
Uh,
there's plenty of places that have,

671
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,950
I don't know if you're gonna look at 
ethical beef production.

672
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,360
There's a lot of places that do it.

673
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,273
I agree.
And the same thing can be said with 

674
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:54,450
chicken and same thing you'd say with 
poultry,

675
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,643
Turkey,
there's a lot of free range and it's 

676
00:29:57,241 --> 00:29:58,074
more of an emphasis.
I think that's one of the reasons why 

677
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:01,950
people become more and more interested 
in hunting today.

678
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,993
They're doing well,
but people are more concerned with the 

679
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:10,230
ethics behind how their food is raised.
You know,

680
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:11,064
there's a lot of farm to table 
restaurants that are opening up which 

681
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:16,080
are really amazing.
You can go and you can,

682
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,943
you know I'm and there's a place near me
and you get these eggs and they're dark 

683
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:21,444
yolks,
like a dark orange yolk at this 

684
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,760
restaurant and they have like grass fed 
beef that tastes healthy.

685
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:30,390
It tastes really good and that's the 
stuff we're supposed to be eating.

686
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:35,391
We've gotten into this crazy situation 
as human beings where we're getting food

687
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:37,224
that is in a lot of ways tasteless 
because it's been engineered to last 

688
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:43,074
forever on a shelf.
We've gotten this meat that's gotten 

689
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:46,194
super fat because they're pumping them 
up with antibiotics and feeding them 

690
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:49,944
grain until they just become these fat,
unhealthy things that are in no way 

691
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,580
resemble a wild creature.

692
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,613
Well,
we had a steak last night at the 

693
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,910
airport.
No,

694
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,190
I've tastewise is like,
I could barely taste it.

695
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:05,123
Yeah.
It was nothing.

696
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,390
Not much to it.
Yeah,

697
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,370
and I think there was also probably the 
way it was cooked,

698
00:31:08,371 --> 00:31:12,150
but what was really weird is the 
difference in the connection with that.

699
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,163
Right?
Like when you sit down and you cook an 

700
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,074
elk steak,
you remember where you were when you 

701
00:31:19,471 --> 00:31:20,304
shot that,
you remember how hard it was to get to 

702
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,840
that elk.
You remember the stock,

703
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:29,520
you remember maybe made me several blown
stocks where the wind shifted on you and

704
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:34,521
the elk spooked and took off and how 
difficult it is and the intense success.

705
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,270
And that's another thing that people 
don't like.

706
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:40,410
The idea of the happiness that comes 
with success when you kill something,

707
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,580
but

708
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,850
it's hard to understand,
I think.

709
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:43,810
Yeah.
But it's.

710
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,523
Yeah,
I mean it's an achievement and it has 

711
00:31:46,981 --> 00:31:47,561
not like,
oh,

712
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,120
we're selling,
we murdered something.

713
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,290
So we're celebrating,
but it's,

714
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,630
it's so hard.
We talked about the difficulty.

715
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,810
Um,
you have achieved something of,

716
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,370
of great difficulty with that animal's 
dead.

717
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,670
And then your skinning it,
you're cutting the meat off.

718
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,710
I mean,
you know,

719
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,630
I took out the tenderloins of,
uh,

720
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,300
of the bull I killed,
you know,

721
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,050
and smelled it and made sure the meat is
always just making sure that,

722
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,780
that is the fruit of the labor,
right there is that meat,

723
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,643
so you just,
you're holding a big slab of steak and 

724
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,100
like you said,
you remember everything,

725
00:32:24,101 --> 00:32:27,100
but most of what I'm thinking of there 
is how clean it is,

726
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,260
how pure it is,
does it smell good,

727
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:31,990
smells perfect.
And that's just kind of the process.

728
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,240
It goes in the meat bag,
it goes on my back,

729
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,660
it comes off the mountain,
it goes in the cooler,

730
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,270
it goes to the process or it gets cut 
and frozen

731
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:43,970
wrapped and then then I cook it.
That's a lot of,

732
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,140
I mean,
a lot of steps.

733
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,660
We go to the airport,
we say,

734
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,830
uh,
yeah,

735
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,990
can I get the Sirloin?
It's it.

736
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,280
Yeah.
That's it.

737
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,200
And that's how most people do it.
Yeah.

738
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,340
And that's a weird place that we've 
gotten into as human beings.

739
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,363
Hunters are judged negatively for having
just that whole emotional thing and all 

740
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,130
the,
the meaning and the feeling.

741
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,770
And the,
and the connection to it in,

742
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,203
and we're judged negatively for that.
The but the person who sits down and 

743
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,170
says,
I'll take the sirloin.

744
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,243
That's good.
Uh,

745
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,750
good to go.
It's like,

746
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,400
it should be opposite.
It should,

747
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,970
but you know what it is too.
It's like the building is faceless,

748
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:20,631
right?
Okay.

749
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,630
The restaurant is faceless.
The supermarket is faceless.

750
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,290
You have no idea who did the actual 
killing of the cow.

751
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,933
When you go to the woods and you come 
out with an elk steak and you kill it 

752
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:36,710
and you're wearing a rocky mountain elk 
foundation belt buckle.

753
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:38,990
And your campaigns like people can look 
to you.

754
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:41,530
Well there I found one right there like 
you are.

755
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,050
And your connection to death.
Meanwhile,

756
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,453
if someone was outside protesting you 
like they found out we're doing this 

757
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:50,780
podcast near like you son of a bitch.
Yeah,

758
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,440
we're,
we're,

759
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,273
we're the ones who put up the petition.
We want to get you banned from under 

760
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,760
armor.
You're a terrible person.

761
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,740
You're a trophy hunter.
You're out there killing animals.

762
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,053
All around them is dead animals.
Every gas station is filled with beef 

763
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:03,674
sticks.
Every restaurant is filled with dead 

764
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:05,444
animals.
Every supermarket is filled with dead 

765
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,560
animals.
In this area where we're at,

766
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,693
there are 100 places that you can walk 
to inside of three minutes that have 

767
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,170
dead animals in them.

768
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,033
Yeah,
but they're.

769
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,110
They'd be protesting here,
testing here.

770
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,003
You because you're the face.
And meanwhile that's what's so back ass 

771
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:25,340
words about it and it's because we're 
doing the right way.

772
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,650
You're doing not saying you have to do 
it that way,

773
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,890
but if you wanted to have the most.
This is weird word,

774
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,070
spiritual connection to your food.
It's,

775
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,953
there's no this,
there's nothing else I've ever 

776
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,490
experienced that's even remotely close.
Right?

777
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.
I mean,

778
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,580
and there's I guess to some people,
some people are getting it,

779
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,773
you know,
there's some people that would be 

780
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,093
protest.
I hear it wouldn't matter what 

781
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:51,283
justification you had.
They are never going to see it and 

782
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,260
that's fine because we're all different.
We all have different passions,

783
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,630
so that group of people,
whatever.

784
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,990
But there's a people in the middle that 
we have,

785
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,273
they have heard and they have thought 
about it and they have realized that 

786
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,190
does make it actually make sense.

787
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,023
And those are the people that want to 
know what it'd be like to be a provider 

788
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:16,340
for themselves to go to go into the 
mountains and,

789
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,640
and become loaded,
loaded out with a,

790
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,290
you know,
a pack full of meat.

791
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,600
And so those are the people I guess 
we're talking to.

792
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,790
We're never going to get the extreme.
People know.

793
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,683
I mean,
and that's always going to be the case 

794
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,274
with all arguments.
There's always going to be radical 

795
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,340
people on all sides,
you know.

796
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:32,640
And I think,
uh,

797
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,160
our job as human beings communicating to
human beings is

798
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,160
to try to relay our own experiences as 
clear and as honest as possible.

799
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,260
And that's why I was trying to look at 
it from the other point of view.

800
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,360
I always try to look at it from what 
people that I think are good people that

801
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,223
become vegans because they're good 
people because they want to have no 

802
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:58,860
cruelty.
And I think they just have a perspective

803
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:03,861
that I don't share and that perspective 
is I've actually been involved in.

804
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,430
I've gone through the ritual of the 
hunting,

805
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,660
we've gone through the trials and 
tribulations of hiking many,

806
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:16,500
many miles and trying to find these 
things and trying to figure out the wind

807
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:16,870
and.

808
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,880
And it hasn't all been success.
No,

809
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,770
it's a lot of failure.
It's a lot of failure.

810
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:21,604
It's more successful lately than ever.
But that's just because I've worked 

811
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:26,170
harder than ever.
And then it be more and more dedication,

812
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:28,960
more time being obsessed.
More time practicing.

813
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,540
I practice every day.
Yeah.

814
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,570
I'm shooting every day.

815
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,560
It's a,
you know,

816
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,770
people see the success,
they see the pictures.

817
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,710
If it's something they want to hate me,
they hate.

818
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,360
I'm sitting there with the dead elk.
But hunting is such a rollercoaster.

819
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:47,570
It's like everything is magnified.
The success is magnified because it's so

820
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:48,404
hard.
The failure is magnified because it 

821
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:52,370
hurts so bad because you've worked so 
hard.

822
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,050
I mean,
I just,

823
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,250
I,
it took me.

824
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,240
I started,
like I said,

825
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:57,074
in 1989,
it took me to 1996 to kill my first six 

826
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:04,490
point bull elk in the wilderness and,
and it would have been,

827
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,560
we wouldn't even look at it on this last
time.

828
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,580
It would have been like,
ah,

829
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:09,050
there's a little bowl.
I mean,

830
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,123
but when I,
when I got that six point bullel I felt 

831
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,240
so proud I'd finally achieved.
I mean,

832
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:18,074
that's,
that's a bull on this buckle right here 

833
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:22,310
is a six point and I thought I finally 
did it,

834
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,043
but in between there had been so many 
disappointments and devastations and in 

835
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:28,844
the wilderness.

836
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,260
I remember one time I had been in there 
by myself.

837
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,123
I'm thinking like day eight as in this 
dry creek bed and here comes these cows 

838
00:37:38,661 --> 00:37:39,494
come across,
here comes this big bowl and I don't 

839
00:37:41,751 --> 00:37:44,030
know how big he was.
He was pretty big for their three,

840
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:46,460
2130,
which is a scoring number.

841
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,213
It would,
which is calculating the length of the 

842
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,550
antlers of the antlers.
Right?

843
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:56,480
So it would have been still slightly 
smaller than the Bulls we just killed.

844
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,350
And he came across there and I'm on my 
knees and I shoot and uh,

845
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,800
I,
I hit,

846
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,530
if you hit him in the shoulder back 
then,

847
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,633
um,
the bose weren't as efficient as they 

848
00:38:09,651 --> 00:38:10,484
are now,
but if you hit him in the shoulder 

849
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:13,820
blade,
it went in about,

850
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,463
I would say an inch inch and a half 
Arrow hit his shoulder blades stopped 

851
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,813
and basically fell out and he went 
running off and I went up and picked up 

852
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,990
my Arrow and there's blood on the 
broadhead and to them,

853
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:29,540
you know,
something like that is they might have a

854
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,800
sore shoulder for a little while.

855
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,190
They take antlers and the guts and neck 
and all the time.

856
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,850
So they heal up there.
They're amazing.

857
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:40,210
So that was nothing centrally,
nothing more than a flesh wound.

858
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,130
But I remember sitting there looking at 
my Arrow,

859
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:42,964
looking at little bit of blood on my 
broadhead and I mean eyes welling up 

860
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:51,790
with tears because eight days just 
there.

861
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,653
But working all year towards that moment
and having that opportunity at 43 yards 

862
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,653
and being inches off because inches 
further to the right back would have 

863
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,310
been doubled.
Long Dead Bull.

864
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,153
Biggest bull ever.
All the hard work paid off to being 

865
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,803
devastated.
So people see the success some 20 years 

866
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,240
later or whatever it's been.
They don't to be,

867
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,103
to feel as disappointed as I was to,
to wonder if all the work was worth it 

868
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,520
to hurt that bad.
They don't see that.

869
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,820
But that's why hunting is so powerful.

870
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,840
That's why hunting has changed my life 
because it's so difficult.

871
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:35,350
And because there's those ups and downs 
and you know,

872
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,963
we try,
we do a better job of sharing the 

873
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,780
complete journey now than back in the 
day.

874
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:41,520
You just,
you know,

875
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,280
just be like,
hey,

876
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,600
killed his bull.
That's it.

877
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,790
You know,
you'd go to the archery pro shop,

878
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,040
you put your picture up of the bullies 
you killed.

879
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,890
And that was it.
Now we're a little more in tune.

880
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,020
I see all sorts of people on social 
media now.

881
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:53,854
And they,
they,

882
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:56,460
they showed the picture of their bowl 
and they get down,

883
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,790
you read the caption,
it's about,

884
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:59,470
you know,
providing for their family and,

885
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,563
and pure protein in their freezer.
So we were doing a better job of 

886
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,500
explaining it.
But still,

887
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,334
until you've been there,
it's really hard to grasp what it all 

888
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,630
means.
No,

889
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:10,980
I don't

890
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,920
to anybody's going to.
I don't think it's possible.

891
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,550
It's also,
it's something more,

892
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:18,750
it's a,
it's a discipline,

893
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,063
but it's something more like sometimes 
people call bowhunting a sport and I 

894
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:24,720
always kind of cringe.
Yeah,

895
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:27,510
I don't like that either because I think
it's not a word for it now.

896
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,270
I don't think there's a comparative 
word.

897
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,823
I think it's bow hunting.
I think it is what it is because I 

898
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:34,760
don't,
I don't.

899
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,750
It's a lifestyle is what I say.
You have to be immersed in the lifestyle

900
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,560
to really understand it.
A sport makes it seem like,

901
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:45,060
you know,
keeping score well,

902
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:47,350
to me it's a lot like Jujitsu in that 
way too.

903
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,440
Where if you talk to people who train in
Jujitsu a lot,

904
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:51,483
they understand how difficult it is and 
they understand the struggle and they 

905
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:58,410
understand that in that struggle.
Like all struggles every day.

906
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,510
I think people need struggle.
I think it's very important.

907
00:41:01,511 --> 00:41:02,980
Yeah,
like you.

908
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You get better not just at the Jujitsu 
or not just at the bowhunting.

909
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,243
You get better at being a person and I 
feel better today after this trip in 

910
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:17,680
Utah than I felt before I left.
Not that I felt bad before I left.

911
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,570
I felt great,
but I feel energized.

912
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,130
I feel energized because the experience,
a fear,

913
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,030
analgesia energized because of the 
struggle.

914
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,900
I feel energized because of how 
difficult it was to hike those mountains

915
00:41:28,901 --> 00:41:31,220
up and down and chasing those elk around
and,

916
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,000
and having things blow out and getting 
back to the,

917
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,880
to the lodge and being so tired that you
could just barely eat your food.

918
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,590
And then I'm passing out almost like out
of as I'm done eating and then I crashed

919
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,020
and the alarm goes off at 5:00
in the morning and then you're out there

920
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:45,854
in the dark.
Doing it again and then have success so 

921
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:49,884
to to understand that you can push 
through things and you can get better 

922
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,213
and you can practice things and you can 
get better and that applies to 

923
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,450
everything in life.
It does.

924
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,370
It's a discipline,
but it's discipline like almost no other

925
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,900
because it's not just a discipline.
It's a discipline that also sustains you

926
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,730
and your family and it's a discipline 
that involves like real critical moments

927
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:14,564
of life and death.
Like when I was drawn back on that bowl 

928
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,153
and I'm looking at this bull through a 
very small window where I could shoot 

929
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,460
between these two trees 32 yards away 
and Colton,

930
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,323
who was the guy paused,
this bully made a cow sound like being 

931
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,670
like right where that bull needed to 
stop.

932
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,320
Like the bulb walked in.
He,

933
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,413
he called it stopped and that critical 
moment where you have to make a perfect 

934
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:42,400
shot in a split second and intensity 
intensity roxane.

935
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,110
It's like nothing else.
Yeah,

936
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,223
it's,
it's end to do it and to do it 

937
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,464
successfully and then have that elk 
dying seconds and have that elk wander 

938
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:53,900
off 20 yards.
Like seeing it bleed out of both sides,

939
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:56,240
knowing this is it,
and this is probably.

940
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,530
No,
not probably,

941
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,900
definitely.
Unless he falls off a cliff.

942
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,093
This is the cleanest,
fastest death this thing is ever going 

943
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,504
to have.
Yeah.

944
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,640
Yeah.
No,

945
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:08,470
and I'm.
And I'm going to eat it tonight.

946
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:11,043
Yeah.
It's,

947
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,720
I don't know.
There's so much reverence in the moment.

948
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:14,554
I what I like and we talked about this 
film and in and capturing it and 

949
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,950
hopefully with the message we can convey
with a film,

950
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,640
but you did a great job after that shot 
of really just a,

951
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:32,490
I guess verbalizing how you felt in and,
and kind of everything you just said,

952
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,430
but more authentic because it was,
it was.

953
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,720
You were there in the bowl,
was laying there dead and uh,

954
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,770
it's um,
I don't know.

955
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:46,983
It's intense.
I wish there's a way people could get 

956
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:49,324
it.

957
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,183
I think these kind of conversations help
a little bit and I know for people 

958
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:54,750
listening,
there's some people that go,

959
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,920
oh,
you guys are redundant.

960
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:57,720
You're just defending hunting,
hunting again.

961
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,050
So boring next.
Anytime

962
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:03,020
it's your guy with the baseball hat on 
sound.

963
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,870
I almost didn't wear a hat today,
but why baseball hats?

964
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,390
They don't like baseball.
I got it.

965
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,100
I've been coughing forever.
I'm like,

966
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,480
Huh?
What about,

967
00:44:12,481 --> 00:44:14,460
what about baseball hats?
They don't like baseball hats.

968
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:15,750
What do you.
Where's this coming from?

969
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,270
I saw it on your comments.
You got to stop reading those.

970
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,203
I think mostly Kinda say like berets.
I'm a painter of the arts one tee shirt 

971
00:44:27,661 --> 00:44:29,620
I wanted to make up.
Now I'm not going to say it.

972
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,160
Going to say my,
uh,

973
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,660
my tee shirt ideas sometimes aren't the 
greatest hitter.

974
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,920
Hilarious when no one's around.
They can be on money.

975
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,120
The one about rain gear is awesome.
Oh my God.

976
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,970
So I tried to,
I try to be positive.

977
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,830
I mean,
I.

978
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,893
Yeah.
Anyway,

979
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,580
except when you're just being funny.
See,

980
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,040
that's like,
that's what I do for a living.

981
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,320
Like when people say,
well that's pretty negative.

982
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,090
Well it's not really because I don't 
mean it,

983
00:44:58,210 --> 00:44:59,043
you know,
like my friends will say some of the 

984
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:00,964
rudest shit about me and I'll laugh my 
ass off because I need to just paint me 

985
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,070
a little bit.
You've made it a little bit,

986
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,530
but that's what makes it funny.
He didn't mean that at all.

987
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,400
If there was no truth to it at all,
it'd be no humor

988
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,170
to it at all.
Had I wanted to touch on this a,

989
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,770
you know,
we talk about the struggle and the,

990
00:45:18,771 --> 00:45:19,890
uh,
the hardship.

991
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,260
I'm Adam Green tree,
our friend,

992
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,973
you know,
he,

993
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,433
he had a in a lot of people here have 
followed along on his journey and what 

994
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,550
would happen.
Yeah.

995
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,160
In his journey will be.
So he hunted three different states over

996
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:38,310
the course of about three weeks and,
uh,

997
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,250
by himself,
by himself solo in the back country with

998
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:43,370
a tiny little tent.
Yeah.

999
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,500
He hunted Colorado.
Then he went to Montana,

1000
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,600
then he ended up killing a bull on 
Idaho.

1001
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,530
If you look on the surface of it,
if you didn't understand,

1002
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,790
you think,
oh,

1003
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,040
he undid three states and he killed a 
five point bull.

1004
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:57,660
Wow.
That was,

1005
00:45:57,710 --> 00:45:59,220
you know,
that's a lot of effort for that.

1006
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,740
But to him and to people who,
who embrace struggle,

1007
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,800
it's not just the,
a five point bull died.

1008
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,910
That was a journey and that was the end 
of the journey and they were success and

1009
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:13,140
there was,
you know,

1010
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:15,690
there was tons of failure along the way.

1011
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,110
Well,
the best part about it was it.

1012
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,000
He documented the entire thing on 
instagram.

1013
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,133
He did it on his instagram story and I 
let people know I put up a bunch of 

1014
00:46:22,241 --> 00:46:23,074
posts about it and one of the posts that
sent his followers skyrocketing was him 

1015
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,593
holding a pistol and then in the 
distance he took a photo of this crazy 

1016
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:36,301
bastard in the moment there's a fucking 
giant grizzly standing on its hind legs.

1017
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,640
Looking at him from it looked like no 
more than 50,

1018
00:46:39,641 --> 00:46:40,474
60 yards away and he's holding up a 
pistol that I said that it's one of the 

1019
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:45,070
most,
like you could see it there.

1020
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,963
Yeah.
That looks like it may be at the most 

1021
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:49,510
probably 100 videos.
So I think it stands out.

1022
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,470
Oh,
is this video?

1023
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,333
Yeah,

1024
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,530
she comes with that.

1025
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,260
Look,
that gun looks like it's 200 years old.

1026
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,003
I don't think it is.
I think it's just out of focus how it's 

1027
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,920
got,
but yeah,

1028
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,050
I mean that,
you know,

1029
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,033
that's a phone video,
so I mean it's way closer than the 

1030
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,414
looks.
It keeps standing up to try to figure 

1031
00:47:14,051 --> 00:47:16,180
out where he is,
what he's doing,

1032
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,100
and in a moment like that

1033
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:25,870
she keeps standing up.
Shoot,

1034
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,180
I'm may lie that his head office,
she comes for me one more time.

1035
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,513
I just can't imagine what it'd be like.
They're welling out there for 20 plus 

1036
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:50,700
days by yourself.
A moment like that is,

1037
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,573
you know,
we're pretty used to being around 

1038
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:55,150
people.
I mean,

1039
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:58,450
if something happened here,
I know you do whatever you could.

1040
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,620
Jamie would do whatever he could to help
you know,

1041
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,640
if we needed help with in that nobody's 
coming your bike 100 percent.

1042
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,500
He's by himself and that,
those types of experiences,

1043
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:13,450
where else are you going to get that?
So he's in,

1044
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:18,480
he's in the mountains.
There's a bear that the bears just doing

1045
00:48:18,491 --> 00:48:20,260
what barriers do right?
And,

1046
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,223
but that.
And he's immersed himself into that 

1047
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,510
world and that's all part of this whole 
process,

1048
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:28,590
that whole journey.
But that's what intrigued everybody does

1049
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,390
following along is because that's as 
real as it gets.

1050
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,283
Yeah.
You know,

1051
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:35,620
and he surviving and we talked about,
you know,

1052
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,360
in our house we got back tired.

1053
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,690
We were able to go to be dry and 
everything else in that intent,

1054
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,160
you're getting in a tent if you were wet
when you got into the tent,

1055
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,620
you're going to be wet in the morning.
You know what I mean?

1056
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,670
Yeah.
I mean it's uh,

1057
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:51,160
it's,
it's uncomfortable,

1058
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,023
it's uncomfortable.
And I know that's what I grew up doing 

1059
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:59,821
because I had no other option that has.
I mean I could hunt Oregon for $25 on an

1060
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,723
elk tag and hunt public land and that's 
all I did for decades because I was the 

1061
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:08,260
only option I have.
And that is,

1062
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,770
that is difficult.
And like I said,

1063
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:15,220
you question why you're doing it.
And people would say no,

1064
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:17,350
I'd kill like a.
If I saw five point bowl,

1065
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,350
like what Adam killed,
I'd kill it and be happy.

1066
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:23,560
And people say you don't need to work 
that hard to kill an elk.

1067
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,563
You know,
you could kill that bull off off a 

1068
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:30,661
gravel road and a truck camp,
but to me that's not what it was about.

1069
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:32,643
It was about the,
the whole journey in the wilderness and 

1070
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:35,974
surviving and,
and navigating and problem solving and 

1071
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,253
yeah,
maybe it wasn't the biggest bull in the 

1072
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:44,920
world,
but that's just one piece of the puzzle.

1073
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:45,810
Yeah,
there isn't.

1074
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:45,860
There's a

1075
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,160
difference between,
and I have done this a few times between

1076
00:49:49,161 --> 00:49:54,161
camping and staying a lodge standard 
lodges nicer.

1077
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,700
Oh yeah.
We were,

1078
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:56,583
we were in Utah.
We would go back to the lodge and it 

1079
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:00,230
was,
you know,

1080
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,123
you and me and our buddy Ben O'brian was
there and was lots of laughs and we're 

1081
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:07,934
having a good time.
We'd all eat dinner together and just 

1082
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,653
shoot the shit.
When you're in the woods and you're 

1083
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,700
camping,
you're still in the woods.

1084
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,580
There's no like with the largest 
civilization,

1085
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,350
there's electricity,
there's hot water.

1086
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,690
You can take a shower when you're in the
woods,

1087
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,330
you stay in the woods when you camp,
you wake up,

1088
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,370
you're in the woods,
you're,

1089
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:31,760
it's a more immersive experience.
And then there's the next level,

1090
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:35,720
which is what Adam did in the woods by 
himself for manny,

1091
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:36,531
manny,
manny,

1092
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:38,480
manny,
days before he had success.

1093
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,600
And then there's video of him after he 
shot that elk 20 whatever days in when,

1094
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,530
you know,
he's like,

1095
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:50,930
it's finally over.
It's finally over.

1096
00:50:50,931 --> 00:50:52,970
It's like,
that guy just went on a vision quest,

1097
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,133
you know,

1098
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:56,090
so much respect for that,
you know,

1099
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:58,490
I mean,
he is so tough.

1100
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,410
And he's um,
bowhunting means,

1101
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:07,310
I don't know if you,
if you tried to explain to explain what,

1102
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:08,720
how,
what does one mean to you?

1103
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:11,150
You couldn't do it with words for 
somebody like him,

1104
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:11,980
you know?
And,

1105
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,660
and I,
I would lock myself in there.

1106
00:51:13,661 --> 00:51:17,600
It's like bawling defines who I am,
who he is.

1107
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,340
But uh,
you know,

1108
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:20,174
it's,
it's.

1109
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:23,120
I know I've done seminars before and 
I've asked people,

1110
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,210
okay,
if there's a 100 or 200 people there,

1111
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:27,223
how many people stayed out in the woods,
in the mountains by themself for one 

1112
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,290
night.
Her never,

1113
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,840
hardly anybody.
I mean,

1114
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:36,674
how many people do you know that have 
stayed out in the woods by themselves 

1115
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,190
for night?

1116
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,023
I just know a few because I know 
hunter's like remy new and green tree 

1117
00:51:43,811 --> 00:51:45,000
and a few other folks,
right?

1118
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,893
So most people,
they don't like to be by themselves and 

1119
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,610
they want to feel safe.
So for Adam to do that for three weeks,

1120
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,520
that says something because hardly 
anybody ever does it.

1121
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,900
Right.
You know,

1122
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,750
and so he did that.
Loved it.

1123
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,330
I think he loved it.
His video said he loved it.

1124
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,250
He didn't always love it,
but no,

1125
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:08,641
I,
I,

1126
00:52:08,641 --> 00:52:10,350
I,
I can't speak for him,

1127
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:13,080
but I can speak for myself and know that
you don't always love it.

1128
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,550
Um,
there's times where I,

1129
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,390
I would question,
like I said,

1130
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,790
what am I doing?
Is this worth it?

1131
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,433
But you'd fight through that and then,
and then you come out stronger and be 

1132
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:30,810
ready for the next challenge and 
hopefully paid off.

1133
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,810
I think any experience in nature is good
for people.

1134
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,673
I think we spent entirely too much time 
and cities entirely too much time 

1135
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:41,040
indoors and buildings and artificial 
lighting and all that stuff.

1136
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:45,150
I think any experience in nature at all 
is good for you.

1137
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:48,360
It's just good to be grounded and 
literally grounded,

1138
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:51,130
like to feel the ground and to 
understand that this is,

1139
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:54,540
this is the wild world,
this is the real world because the other

1140
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:59,040
thing is this out thing that we've sort 
of concocted as human beings,

1141
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,203
but the more time you spend in there,
the more it reveals itself to you and 

1142
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:06,900
there's a weird empty loneliness to true
wilderness.

1143
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,883
Like when you're at the top of a 
mountain and you don't have any cell 

1144
00:53:09,601 --> 00:53:13,440
signal and you don't see a building 
anywhere as far as the eye can see.

1145
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,274
You don't see there's no.
We're nowhere near city when we're out 

1146
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,124
there.
When you sit up there and you look out 

1147
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:23,790
and you hear a coyote howl and you see 
an eagle fly overhead and you know,

1148
00:53:23,791 --> 00:53:25,710
you hear an elk bugle,
you just.

1149
00:53:25,711 --> 00:53:28,200
It's just,
there's nothing like it.

1150
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,480
Now.
It's the real wild.

1151
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,940
I mean these things,
they don't.

1152
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,080
They don't know you're a real thing.
They don't care.

1153
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,200
They care.
If you get close to them,

1154
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,034
they'll run away.
But what they're there to do is what 

1155
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:41,280
they've been doing for thousands.

1156
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,580
Yeah,
and that's it set.

1157
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,463
It's so different.
You talk about how we got to lax last 

1158
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,650
night and I'm just walking around going 
and I don't know,

1159
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,840
100 percent feel this way,
but I'm like,

1160
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:54,890
I told,
told you,

1161
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,733
I'm like,
I hate people just there was so many 

1162
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:03,740
because we went from no people and 
that's,

1163
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,730
it's so enriching.
And so,

1164
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,250
I dunno what I keep saying,
powerful.

1165
00:54:10,251 --> 00:54:14,300
I don't know word,
but is it all the time by Stag stag.

1166
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:16,340
Powerful Joe Rogan.
Um,

1167
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:19,750
but in the mountains it's A.
I dunno,

1168
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,800
it's so simple.
Life is so simple.

1169
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:22,870
It's like it isn't,
it isn't.

1170
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,870
Right.
Because it's super complicated.

1171
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,370
Like to survive out there you have to 
have a lot of things work in your favor.

1172
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:30,343
Yeah.
But it's simple because either you 

1173
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,750
survive or you don't.
Yeah.

1174
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:37,070
But it's not because it's either you 
kill the bull or you don't,

1175
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,620
or you eat berries,
automate a lot of berries.

1176
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

1177
00:54:40,401 --> 00:54:41,310
So,
I mean it's a,

1178
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,183
that's where I,
like,

1179
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,210
I like about that.
It's simple.

1180
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,150
There's no,
you know,

1181
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:49,700
there's no different social classes of 
people.

1182
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:50,534
There's no

1183
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,570
very important.
Right?

1184
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:52,230
Yeah,
that's,

1185
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,063
there's a,
there's a thing that happens out there 

1186
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:59,481
where you're clearly defined by your 
ability to perform under pressure.

1187
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:00,684
Only if you're,
if you go out there and you're some 

1188
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:06,480
famous rock star or something like that.
Here's some,

1189
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:07,463
you know,
some guy who lives in a giant mansion 

1190
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,730
and flies around and private jet and you
own an island,

1191
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,953
but you choke when you're going to shoot
a ball and you shoot it in the Dick and 

1192
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:19,830
everybody knows you're a loser.
You're a loser.

1193
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,790
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?

1194
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,630
Yeah.
Is A,

1195
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,310
there's a leveling.

1196
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:24,443
There's out there.
It's like the people who get respect 

1197
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,620
hunters get re.
I mean if you,

1198
00:55:29,621 --> 00:55:31,060
uh,
um,

1199
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,980
you know,
if you can navigate,

1200
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:35,320
if you can see elk,
if you can,

1201
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,510
uh,
read blood.

1202
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,650
If your blood trailing you can,
you,

1203
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,420
you got woodsmen ship,
you can unravel a blood trail.

1204
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:46,600
You can start a fire.
You're here.

1205
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,493
Yeah.
It doesn't matter about how much money 

1206
00:55:48,671 --> 00:55:49,504
you have or who you are.
If you can't do any of that stuff while 

1207
00:55:52,451 --> 00:55:52,850
you're

1208
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,650
your lower.
To me,

1209
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,873
it was incredibly important to be able 
to perform during crunch time because I 

1210
00:56:00,471 --> 00:56:03,230
wanted the respect of the people that 
also do it.

1211
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,680
I wanted to get that was very important 
to be able to in that moment and I spent

1212
00:56:10,071 --> 00:56:15,071
so much time thinking about it,
going over podcasts and all that.

1213
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:19,850
Joel Turner stuff about target panic and
about the closed loop,

1214
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:20,684
an open loop mind systems and how your 
brain functions pressure and thinking 

1215
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:25,054
about all these different things.
A lot of thought to this might sound 

1216
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,960
ridiculous to somebody who has that 
shot.

1217
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:30,920
A bow that like what?
No,

1218
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,680
you just pull back and shoot,
right?

1219
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,893
No,
no,

1220
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,290
no.
It's when you look at a 900 pound forest

1221
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:43,291
horse was spears grown out of its head 
and screaming and there's one shot.

1222
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:44,974
You have one opportunity and by the way,
you only have one tag and if you wound 

1223
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:49,900
an animal,
it's over.

1224
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:50,711
Yeah.
If you.

1225
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,290
If you just shot in the ankle and it 
starts bleeding,

1226
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,153
guess what?
Your tags over the money that you spent 

1227
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:59,600
is done.
You failed and that thing lives to be,

1228
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,453
you know,
lives to be an elk and lives another 

1229
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:02,944
day,
another day,

1230
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:03,881
and you,
uh,

1231
00:57:03,881 --> 00:57:07,450
you go back disappointed and you have to
start from scratch and rebuild yourself.

1232
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:11,770
And that's good too.
The failure in the feeling of failure is

1233
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,600
the real motivator.
That's what,

1234
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,463
what makes you run more miles,
more arrows worked hard to think about 

1235
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,050
it.
Think your way through this thing.

1236
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,213
And to me that,
that leveling of the social classes is 

1237
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:25,600
very important.
You know,

1238
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,730
it's something that I think Jujitsu does
as well.

1239
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:30,520
Um,
there's another parallel in that because

1240
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,850
even comedy does that as well because if
you're not funny,

1241
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:36,000
people don't laugh and they don't like 
you,

1242
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,163
you know,
you have to be able to do the thing and 

1243
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:43,270
sometimes the thing doesn't work out and
then you feel like fucking terrible,

1244
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,380
you know?

1245
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:49,380
And that leveling of the classes that 
happens in bowhunting is a,

1246
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:51,663
is it's hard as I keep saying,
it's hard to describe because it really 

1247
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,104
is.
I think anything that's very difficult 

1248
00:57:58,781 --> 00:57:59,614
to do.
You find out more about yourself and 

1249
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:03,460
when you find out more about yourself,
you have two options.

1250
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:07,330
Either you can go into denial or ignore 
it or you know,

1251
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:08,164
fade back or you could face it and 
struggle more and get better and really 

1252
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:18,511
work at it and that's where I think 
bowhunting shares a lot of,

1253
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:22,023
a lot of its aspects with other 
difficult but yet important things in 

1254
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,014
life that become.
They become a vehicle for developing 

1255
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:29,680
your human potential.
Yeah,

1256
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:33,580
and that running is like that too.
We'll look what it's done for you.

1257
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:34,693
I mean your,
your passion and obsession with elk 

1258
00:58:37,421 --> 00:58:42,010
hunting is what led you to being this 
crazy ultra marathon runner.

1259
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,020
I mean that's really what started it 
all.

1260
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,440
I wanted to be better in the mountains.
Yeah,

1261
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,290
better at it.
I never really understood until I hunted

1262
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:54,910
with you because when you would run up 
the top of the fucking hill when the elk

1263
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:58,420
would go over the top and you'd run up 
the hill and I would just speech,

1264
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:01,900
struggling to go a quarter of the way 
and I'd have to take a break and then to

1265
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:02,734
go a little further and take a break and
you already are or up there and you 

1266
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:07,090
weren't even out of breath.
And then I thought about it.

1267
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:07,691
I'm like,
okay,

1268
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:09,060
I get it.
I get this.

1269
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:09,910
No,
like this.

1270
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:11,350
There's a lot to this.
Yeah,

1271
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,270
yeah.
That.

1272
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,960
And that's um,
you know,

1273
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,833
you talked about it is,
it's crazy to bowhunting has done what 

1274
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:22,220
it's done.
I've been on Joe Rogan

1275
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,220
nine times,
Jamie nine times and you know,

1276
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,600
I don't for me personally because I just
feel like I'm okay about.

1277
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:33,434
I'm decent at bowhunting and it's just 
the fact that I was even here one time 

1278
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:39,400
seems surreal.
But what I,

1279
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:40,870
I just,
I want to thank,

1280
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:42,193
I don't know,
I was thinking about this earlier is 

1281
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:47,000
because of bowhunting.
My people,

1282
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,570
I know people will say,
because I,

1283
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,910
again,
I read the comments,

1284
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:53,030
but don't read the comments.
They'll talk about that a,

1285
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,343
Oh,
it must be nice for Joe to be able to 

1286
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:57,530
hunt wherever.
I mean where we were,

1287
00:59:57,531 --> 00:59:58,970
it was amazing.
Is like,

1288
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:03,740
that's where we all kind of just where I
feel like I've had to work my whole life

1289
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,060
to get to,
to dream,

1290
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,450
to killing bulls on public land,
to,

1291
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,373
to starting with the spike bowl to 30 
years of this and it's a dream and it's 

1292
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,234
like I,
I will never take for granted what it 

1293
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,800
means to where we were hunting in Utah.

1294
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:25,090
But it seems crazy to think that you 
grew up in Massachusetts,

1295
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:25,910
right?
Yeah.

1296
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,880
Right.
You had the whole different journey.

1297
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,743
You weren't some kid bowhunting,
but you were a comedian and a fighter 

1298
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:34,184
and a whatever.
But bowhunting brought us together and 

1299
01:00:37,791 --> 01:00:38,624
we shared this,
this life changing time and Utah from 

1300
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,390
completely opposite paths.
And so whether that's,

1301
01:00:47,391 --> 01:00:49,190
um,
you know,

1302
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,743
you,
you took your path to get to the best 

1303
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:56,120
outcome in the world.
I took my path.

1304
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:58,070
It doesn't matter.
We were hunters.

1305
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:58,904
They're sharing the mountain and taking 
on the challenge together and that's 

1306
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:05,690
what bowhunting does is it eliminates,
you know,

1307
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,543
you're here in la.
It eliminates everything and we're the 

1308
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,350
same.
Yeah,

1309
01:01:09,351 --> 01:01:10,184
all very difficult pursuits,
but we're limited in their bullshit and 

1310
01:01:13,241 --> 01:01:14,074
it's a,
it's,

1311
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,480
there's not very many things I can do 
that we named a few of them,

1312
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,420
but it's just like when you think about 
it like that,

1313
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:22,370
it seems unreal

1314
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,243
real,
but it also sort of really clearly 

1315
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:28,740
defines why this discipline is so 
important to you and I

1316
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:31,840
[inaudible] well and it's,
I don't know.

1317
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:32,674
I think it's.
And hopefully we've opened the eyes of 

1318
01:01:34,751 --> 01:01:38,040
others to see that I don't know,
to,

1319
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:40,630
to want that same type of experience.
You know,

1320
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:42,130
you might not be the same.
It might not.

1321
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:45,290
Not Everybody's going to get to where we
hunted in Utah because it's great

1322
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,390
public land hunt.
I mean,

1323
01:01:46,391 --> 01:01:48,220
I was listening to Brian Barney's 
podcast,

1324
01:01:48,221 --> 01:01:49,054
the Eastman elevated podcasts where he 
took a couple of buddies when I was 

1325
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:54,490
actually cutting up meat today.
I was listening to this,

1326
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:59,200
took a couple of buddies with him on a 
public land hunt in Montana and they got

1327
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,840
into some elk and they seemed like they 
had an amazing time.

1328
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:02,720
They got rained out,
Mrs.

1329
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:05,290
Same sort of thing.
It's an amazing adventure,

1330
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,333
you know?
It's available in a lot of different 

1331
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,850
forms to a lot of people and there's a 
lot of people that go,

1332
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,900
Oh,
you know,

1333
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,150
this is bullshit.
You know,

1334
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,993
joe gets to do this and chose low key 
and this and I think it's Hashtag 

1335
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:16,840
bullshit.
Hashtag bullshit.

1336
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,890
Yeah.
Guess what?

1337
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:20,310
I'm lucky.
I've always been lucky.

1338
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,410
I don't know what to do.
You want me to be unlucky?

1339
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:23,723
I can't.

1340
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,050
I'm just lucky.
I mean,

1341
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:28,860
maybe I'll be unlucky off.
That's also part of luck.

1342
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:32,110
Part of luck is you have to.
It's what is that,

1343
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,690
that phrase like luck is when 
opportunity meets preparation.

1344
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,060
You know,
that's what some people say.

1345
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,010
It's that,
but it's also luck.

1346
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:41,910
You know,
there's,

1347
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:43,650
there's people that are luckier than 
you,

1348
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:44,281
you know,
and,

1349
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:45,114
but by the way,
there's people that are way fucking 

1350
01:02:46,051 --> 01:02:46,884
luckier than me.
You don't think Justin Bieber's lucky 

1351
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:49,620
than me,
that little cunt.

1352
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,603
He's never been poor in his life.
He's worth 100 million bucks and he's 

1353
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:55,530
like 20 years old.
He probably has no comment.

1354
01:02:55,531 --> 01:02:58,920
His body,
he's probably everyday just drained.

1355
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,210
He probably just has to eat raw eggs all
day just to try to just try to keep up.

1356
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,410
Yeah,
stay hydrated.

1357
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:05,900
Justin.
Stay hydrated,

1358
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:06,760
kid.
Yeah,

1359
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,793
we're counting on you.
I mean that little fuckers way more 

1360
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,650
lucky at Cameron.

1361
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:15,680
There's always literally there's always 
going to be people that are luckier than

1362
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:20,040
you and some of it is luck and some of 
it is courage.

1363
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,170
Some of it is putting your ass out 
there.

1364
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:23,004
Some of it is trying things.
One of the things that I always like to 

1365
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:29,460
tell people that I think you should do 
is do shit that's difficult.

1366
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,730
It's very important to struggle and it 
doesn't mean bowhunting.

1367
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:36,660
I liked yoga class for the same reason I
go in there,

1368
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:41,661
it's me and a bunch of housewives and 
they're kicking ass more than I am.

1369
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:42,633
I mean,
I watched these ladies and I watched 

1370
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:48,000
their mental strength and fortitude.
While they're grueling their way through

1371
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:48,834
this 100,
four degree temperature holding these 

1372
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:51,474
poses,
I'm watching the sweat poor off their 

1373
01:03:53,221 --> 01:03:56,250
face and they're not complaining,
they're just in there grinding,

1374
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:57,630
you know,
and that's,

1375
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,240
that's fucking so important in this 
life.

1376
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,540
This life doesn't have enough of that.
There's not enough struggle.

1377
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,120
You don't get to know yourself without 
struggle.

1378
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,610
You don't get to know your boundaries 
unless you push them.

1379
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,650
You don't get to know who you are 
really,

1380
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:14,910
unless you're tested and there's too 
many weak pussies pussies out there.

1381
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:15,923
And so those are the people that drive 
me crazy because everything you just 

1382
01:04:18,571 --> 01:04:19,404
said is so true.
But there are so many people that would 

1383
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:24,570
rather stand on the sidelines and say,
Oh,

1384
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,170
must be nice to be able to blah,
blah,

1385
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:29,820
blah.
Shut up.

1386
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,810
Yeah,
it is nice.

1387
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,270
It's also,
you worked your ass off.

1388
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,470
Come follow me,
bitch.

1389
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,000
Come,
come do what I do.

1390
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:36,930
Yeah,
good luck.

1391
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,793
Those are the people.
When you were talking about running was 

1392
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:40,854
so you were involved in,
someone was behind you and they were 

1393
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:45,510
like running right on your,
your your tail and you're like,

1394
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:47,250
oh,
let's see how this works out for you.

1395
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,330
Like it's not.
It's not even a cocky thing.

1396
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:55,410
It's like there's no way a regular 
person is going to keep up with you in a

1397
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:57,480
race.
It's just not going to happen.

1398
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:58,763
Let's see how this works out and that's 
just because they're not getting up at 

1399
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:03,241
5:00
in the morning.

1400
01:05:03,241 --> 01:05:06,810
I follow your instagram,
your your fucking running before work.

1401
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:10,630
Right now you're running a marathon a 
day for people that don't know you run.

1402
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,400
They're literally preparing right now.
Why?

1403
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:14,700
Cam is in the middle of bow hunting 
season.

1404
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:17,920
He takes a little bit of time off of 
this fucking insane preparation,

1405
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:20,260
which is good because it allows his body
to heal,

1406
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,340
but he's going to compete in the Moab in
October.

1407
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,080
That is 238 fucking miles.
It's a straight rate.

1408
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,540
It's not 238 miles over the course of a 
month.

1409
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:31,811
No,
no,

1410
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:35,650
no.
It's 238 miles from beginning.

1411
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:39,370
Ready go to the races.
Over 238 miles.

1412
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:40,840
It'll take what?
Three days?

1413
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,820
I don't know.
We don't know.

1414
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:44,350
Seven,
eight hours to do two.

1415
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:44,771
Oh,
five,

1416
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:45,790
right foot.
200.

1417
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,800
And did he ran 205 fucking miles in 78 
hours.

1418
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,580
So shut your mouth.
Moves.

1419
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,230
Moves.
Printers.

1420
01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:00,110
There's levels this life,
there's levels to this.

1421
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:03,940
This dedication to discipline,
to drive,

1422
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:05,920
to focus,
to obsession.

1423
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:06,754
There's levels to it,
and if you're sitting on the sidelines 

1424
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,780
will most be noise.
Guess what,

1425
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:14,830
Pussy you're not doing this.
This is my lab here.

1426
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:18,190
God Damn.
Look at this horrendous fucking terrain.

1427
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,920
They're running on a mountain.
GS.

1428
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:21,910
As quite.
Look,

1429
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:26,911
look at this video for people who are 
listening only I urge you to please go.

1430
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:30,460
Jamie,
what does the video official trailer for

1431
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:31,900
the Moab?
Two Hundred Moab.

1432
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,070
200.
And I love that.

1433
01:06:33,071 --> 01:06:35,140
They call it 200.
Meanwhile it's 238.

1434
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:36,020
Like,
no,

1435
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,500
you're not pissy.
He got out of the 38 miles.

1436
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:43,030
No,
but the terrain is fucking insane.

1437
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:44,290
It's insane.

1438
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,110
So that,
that.

1439
01:06:45,110 --> 01:06:47,270
That's my lab,
I've never run in Moab,

1440
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:49,190
which is the draw for me,
you know.

1441
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:50,690
Um,
I've been in the mountains a lot.

1442
01:06:50,691 --> 01:06:53,900
I haven't been.
What's going to be tough about this race

1443
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,200
specifically is you see how there's no 
shade.

1444
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,140
So that's what we call that as it's 
exposed,

1445
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:03,770
you're exposed the whole time to the sun
and that,

1446
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:06,020
that looks like candace right there.
Who's a race director.

1447
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:08,150
She's running this in this trailer right
here.

1448
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,790
Um,
so this was her brain child basically.

1449
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,940
And uh,
she must be a savage.

1450
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,200
She is,
she's a total stud.

1451
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,063
I mean,
she's,

1452
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,360
she's,
she's running a bunch of,

1453
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:23,870
done really well in hundred mile ultras.
This terrain is fucking magnificent,

1454
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,910
right?
So being exposed like that,

1455
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:30,050
that just sucks everything out of you.
The son can just sap you and,

1456
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:31,410
uh,
keeping your,

1457
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,180
your skin covered as well as you can,
keeping hydrated,

1458
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:37,820
keeping fueled up.
That's just a,

1459
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,990
the name of the game,
you know,

1460
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:41,820
what shoes will you be running on?
Um,

1461
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:42,740
it'll be,
you know,

1462
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:47,060
my under armour fat tires is what I'll 
be running in because that much pounding

1463
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:51,350
for that long.
The cushion for my body is important and

1464
01:07:51,351 --> 01:07:52,480
imperative basically.

1465
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:54,580
And the fat tires,
the underarmour fat tires.

1466
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:55,414
How much different are they than the 
under armour fat tire hunting boots 

1467
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:00,530
because I know they have those two that 
the souls are similar.

1468
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,650
Similar as much cushioning.
Yeah.

1469
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,633
Okay.
So you get a good amount of cushioning 

1470
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:06,310
and also a good amount of traction,
right?

1471
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:08,590
Because basically the fat tires,
the way they're,

1472
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,440
the reason why they're named that way is
because they essentially,

1473
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:15,830
the bottoms of them are like a bmx rode 
mountain bike,

1474
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:18,200
mountain bike tire.
They had a mountain bike tire called fat

1475
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:18,970
tire

1476
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:22,220
and I think Michelin made it so Michelin
makes these,

1477
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,680
these same souls for the under armour 
shoes.

1478
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,660
And that's what I generally trained in 
because running a marathon a day as you.

1479
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,620
That's what I was trying to do before 
season season is Kinda,

1480
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,400
um,
hopefully it's context.

1481
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:36,683
Yeah.
Hunting season is his interrupted my 

1482
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:39,560
training.
But I,

1483
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:40,483
I sorta had this,
this game plan where this would be the 

1484
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:45,470
time I'd recover.
So,

1485
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,090
um,
my whole training slogan is a train hard

1486
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:50,924
hunt.
Easy meaning that I want my training to 

1487
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:57,260
be harder than any hunt I could go on.
And so the hunt seems like it's easier,

1488
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,370
easier than my training and that's,
that's kind of what's been going on.

1489
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,740
The.
I mean the Utah country was tough.

1490
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,990
It was high,
it was steep.

1491
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,853
There's lots of walking,
but it was easier than running a 

1492
01:09:09,501 --> 01:09:11,920
marathon a day.
So I felt I felt good.

1493
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,220
There's the fat tire.
Yes.

1494
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,353
So those shoes also will allow you to 
run over elect sharp rocks and things 

1495
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:22,340
and it'll absorb that.
So it'll give your feet some protection.

1496
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:25,630
Obviously this is an incredibly 
difficult pursuit that you're about.

1497
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:26,570
Yeah,
there they are.

1498
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:27,050
There.

1499
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:29,090
That was a photo back home.
But uh,

1500
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,560
um,
yeah,

1501
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:33,110
those shoes,
they've worked well for me.

1502
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:33,981
Uh,
they're great.

1503
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:36,080
They've kept my body healthy with all 
the pounding.

1504
01:09:36,081 --> 01:09:38,420
You know,
people always ask about knees and hips.

1505
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:39,480
Anything else?
You know,

1506
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,370
I've run a lot in those minimalist 
shoes,

1507
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:43,080
but I don't,
I don't think you could.

1508
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,340
I mean,
maybe you could.

1509
01:09:44,341 --> 01:09:48,450
Does anybody run these fucking ultra 
marathons in minimalist shoes now?

1510
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,610
You can just can't write.
Not that I've ever seen,

1511
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,950
it just seems like it's too much,
but there's,

1512
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,810
you know,
everybody's different,

1513
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:55,733
right?
There probably is somebody who can 

1514
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:01,560
because they're 20 some years old and 
they feel great and therefore whatever.

1515
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:04,230
Maybe it's been doing it in those shoes 
for a long time.

1516
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:06,120
Their body mechanics are different than 
mine,

1517
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:07,830
you know,
they're lighter than me,

1518
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,000
so yeah,
maybe they could.

1519
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:11,010
So it's,
I never loved anybody in like,

1520
01:10:11,011 --> 01:10:11,970
Oh,
you can't do this.

1521
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:13,470
You can do that.
They might be able to.

1522
01:10:13,471 --> 01:10:14,304
I can't.
That's another thing too about you is 

1523
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:19,470
that you're lifting a lot of weights too
because you need it for you.

1524
01:10:19,471 --> 01:10:22,860
You also need strength for hunting.
You need strength to pull the bow back.

1525
01:10:22,861 --> 01:10:24,870
You need strength to be able to pack out
the meat.

1526
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:26,093
There's a lot of other aspects to like 
what you need out of your body that 

1527
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:32,810
maybe the regular ultra marathon runner

1528
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,000
doesn't.
Yeah.

1529
01:10:34,001 --> 01:10:34,631
It's,
you know,

1530
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:38,140
I've tried to.
I've tweaked my training over the years.

1531
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:41,200
There was a time where all I was doing 
was running 20 miles a day,

1532
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,180
not lifting,
hardly eating,

1533
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:46,450
and I was down to 157 pounds,
so now I try to,

1534
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:47,543
I that didn't work that great for 
hunting because I'm trying to pack meat 

1535
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,840
and in the mountains.
You guys felt tired?

1536
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,250
Yeah,
I just didn't feel.

1537
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,380
I just didn't feel at my best.
I could still kill.

1538
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:58,150
I could still get,
get the job done,

1539
01:10:58,151 --> 01:11:03,151
but I felt like I wasn't at my best.
So now I feel like what I do now,

1540
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,430
this is a small shirt,
so it's like,

1541
01:11:06,431 --> 01:11:08,180
don't,
don't be tricked by that.

1542
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,190
I'm filling out the shirt

1543
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,540
that's a size small size,
small Ontario.

1544
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,140
That's because it jed

1545
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:15,990
fucking judd.
I'm grateful.

1546
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:17,340
Dead Shirt on.
I'm like,

1547
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:18,174
Hey,
you got any.

1548
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,790
You got any size mediums for me?
And he's like,

1549
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,840
oh,
they're all gone.

1550
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,240
So here I am.
I stuck with the smallest am I look like

1551
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:26,370
a more jack that I really am pretty 
jacked.

1552
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:27,360
Dude.
I've worked out with you.

1553
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,270
Stop.
But it's just unusual for someone who,

1554
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:32,700
an endurance athlete who does these 
long,

1555
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:33,563
you know,
200 plus mile races to be packing a lot 

1556
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:37,224
of muscle.
Yeah.

1557
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,143
It's one of the reasons why whenever 
someone would talk about UFC fighters 

1558
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,070
not being able to make the weight or,
you know,

1559
01:11:44,071 --> 01:11:45,160
whatever,
you know,

1560
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,550
complaints they have about not being 
able to make weight.

1561
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:52,580
I'm like my friend Cam literally you 
make your body eat itself to drop down.

1562
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,750
You were at 180 plus pounds before you 
started.

1563
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,210
And then when you went to run the big 
foot,

1564
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:02,400
200 you had do,
you were,

1565
01:12:02,430 --> 01:12:03,263
you were burning 3000 calories and 
eating 2000 or a thousand calorie 

1566
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:07,860
deficit.

1567
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,840
So if it was,
if I was burning for 83,

1568
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:12,450
so are far as burning three 82,
something like that.

1569
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:13,800
So I try to to,
uh,

1570
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,080
be at a deficit,
a thousand calories every day.

1571
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,180
And your body was just eating itself.
Yeah.

1572
01:12:18,181 --> 01:12:19,014
So when I went into that race,
I was 160 165 and I had been in 

1573
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:26,910
[inaudible] 84.
So I lost 19 pounds of just that calorie

1574
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:31,470
deficit and just the key with those is 
being light,

1575
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,420
you know,
the lighter you are,

1576
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:37,440
the best ultra runners are generally 140
pounds,

1577
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:38,940
maybe six foot,
you know,

1578
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:42,390
I mean just light and that's just to be 
efficient.

1579
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,253
The longer legs is more efficient.
Is that why it's better to be six foot 

1580
01:12:46,291 --> 01:12:47,570
and really skinny?
Nah,

1581
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:48,413
I've just,
I mean maybe I'm just kind of 

1582
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,720
generalizing,
but a,

1583
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,690
that seems like those are good runners 
are about that size.

1584
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,560
Is that like Goggins David Goggins 
would.

1585
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,320
I think he's a little bigger.
He,

1586
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,010
he's,
he's more muscular than most and he's.

1587
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,410
But he's a freak.
He's a mental freak.

1588
01:13:04,411 --> 01:13:05,430
He's a freak.
I mean,

1589
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,810
so,
so inspiring.

1590
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,640
You ever listen to him talk about the 
time,

1591
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:10,800
mental toughness?
I listened to a.

1592
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:15,270
He did a podcast with a rich roll.
Oh,

1593
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:16,560
there's another guy I love.
Yeah.

1594
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:18,390
And so I listened to him on that 
podcast.

1595
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:22,110
I've listened to it like three times 
because anytime you think that,

1596
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,190
oh,
you got a harder,

1597
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,630
you can't do this,
you can't do that.

1598
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,290
Come on.
There's levels come on,

1599
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,750
there's levels he is,
and that's another one.

1600
01:13:30,751 --> 01:13:33,330
You can't lump everybody into the same 
category and say,

1601
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:35,010
well,
if David Goggins did this,

1602
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,600
you can't do what Dave and David Goggins
if you want to become David Goggins.

1603
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,940
Good fucking luck.
I don't stop when I'm tired.

1604
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:42,930
I stop when I'm done.

1605
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,280
Yeah,
he's,

1606
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,113
he's intense.
He has another saying that I think of 

1607
01:13:46,561 --> 01:13:49,380
all the time when I'm running that most 
people quit at 40 percent.

1608
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:50,580
Yeah,
I know.

1609
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,770
And that's,
that's 100 percent true.

1610
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,210
And uh,
I found that,

1611
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,183
you know,
there's lots of times will I want to 

1612
01:13:56,161 --> 01:13:56,994
quit.
And I think if I click on that picture 

1613
01:13:58,081 --> 01:13:58,711
right there,
Jamie,

1614
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:00,180
the where he sees abs,
they were just,

1615
01:14:00,181 --> 01:14:01,560
you had just had your cursor.
Yeah.

1616
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,850
That's a Jack Dude for someone who runs 
hundreds of miles and he did,

1617
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:06,684
you know,
he was over 300 pounds twice in his 

1618
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,231
life.
Yeah.

1619
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:12,070
Fat and lethargic.
And

1620
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,790
he wanted to be a navy seal.
He's over $300 there.

1621
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:16,953
They said he had to lose something like 
100 or 80 pounds and just a number of 

1622
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:21,724
months.
And he did.

1623
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,093
Yeah.
And didn't he also break a world record 

1624
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:29,060
in suffering is the true test of life?
No.

1625
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,560
He,
he broke the world record in whole.

1626
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,990
Yeah.
Yeah.

1627
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,070
How many pull ups did he do?
4,000.

1628
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:39,070
30 in how many minutes?
Seventeen hours.

1629
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:42,160
Yeah.
He fuck.

1630
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,980
But he did it and I've seen some video 
in 17 hours.

1631
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:45,650
What,
uh,

1632
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,160
his shoulders look like.
What's the inside?

1633
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:50,500
It's just all scar tissue holding that 
thing together.

1634
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,630
Let's see if they could find a video,
Jamie,

1635
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:58,060
because I've seen a video of him doing 
David completed 2,588

1636
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:03,710
pull ups in five hundred sixty six cents
for a total of four point six pull ups.

1637
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,753
Preset 1000 pull ups in two hours.
Forty eight minutes and 2000 pull ups 

1638
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:10,720
and 3034 minutes.

1639
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,853
But at 13 point five hours in,
he felt something in his wrist snap and 

1640
01:15:14,501 --> 01:15:19,360
was not able to go on an x ray at 10:30.
Confirmed a partial tear in his forearm.

1641
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,320
Wow.
So that's,

1642
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,183
that's when he fell.
He failed twice to break the record and 

1643
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:27,000
then ended up getting it.
Wow,

1644
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:30,490
so you can get to a video because 
there's a video of him doing it and it's

1645
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:35,491
just savage.
He would do like a set a forearm apart.

1646
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:40,690
He would do sets of five,
so he'd do five then dropped down,

1647
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,150
take a break for a sec,
do five more.

1648
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:45,310
And he kept doing that is what I.
When I saw that,

1649
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:46,263
well you know,
that's that Pavle taught celine's idea 

1650
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,464
of a strength training.
I think I've told you that he believes 

1651
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:58,150
that you should only look if you can do 
sets of more than five,

1652
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,040
that what you're doing is bodybuilding.

1653
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,340
You should do five with very clean 
technique,

1654
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,233
take a big break and then do another 
five and then just keep doing it for 

1655
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:07,174
long periods of time.
Like ideally maybe some people don't 

1656
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:10,480
have the time to do those kinds of 
workouts,

1657
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:11,523
but he believes you should do like with 
five to 10 minute rest in between 

1658
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:18,160
workouts sets and just do a bunch of 
sets like that.

1659
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:21,850
And I've been doing that for awhile now 
and I feel less sore,

1660
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,713
less fatigue.
It can do it more often and I just feel 

1661
01:16:25,091 --> 01:16:27,700
like he make better progress that way.
Yeah.

1662
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,563
I think there's something to it.
I think we have a lot of like meathead 

1663
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,473
ideas in our head of what you're 
supposed to do as far as working out as 

1664
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:38,370
far as you know,
going to failure all the time with heavy

1665
01:16:38,371 --> 01:16:40,000
weights.
That's the only way to get strong.

1666
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,460
I don't necessarily think that's true.
No,

1667
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,280
and,
but I will say everyone's different.

1668
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,140
Yeah.
But this the thing where I should have a

1669
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:49,870
caveat.
If you're a power lifter,

1670
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,580
I should shut the fuck up because if 
you're off,

1671
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,890
all you're trying to do is like massive 
amounts of weight.

1672
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:59,360
Like a lot of these guys do.
Well then you know,

1673
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,203
they're,
they're gonna push their body quite a 

1674
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:02,350
bit more than I am.
Yeah.

1675
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,393
I see guys all the time do things that 
most people would say you should never 

1676
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:09,100
do.
And they have a lot of success.

1677
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,023
You know?
I mean,

1678
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:14,630
nobody's going to say you should run a 
marathon everyday during your say that's

1679
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:17,510
a good way to get injured and that's too
much in your body.

1680
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:18,344
You're not,
you're not getting the most out of your 

1681
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:20,720
body.
Nobody's like,

1682
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,270
when I lift,
I try to do tons of reps,

1683
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,490
you know,
at least 20 reps per set.

1684
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,260
But you're doing lighter weights.
Yeah.

1685
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:29,680
You're not trying to go to failure with 
heavy weights,

1686
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:33,560
trying to go to failure with everything.
And so if 20 doesn't get it then I'll do

1687
01:17:33,770 --> 01:17:34,790
40.
You know?

1688
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:35,624
So it's been a unit.
You're not trying to go to failure with 

1689
01:17:36,801 --> 01:17:37,281
like three.
Oh,

1690
01:17:37,281 --> 01:17:38,460
five for Ben.
No,

1691
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,790
no,
no,

1692
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:39,870
no.
See that's what I'm talking about.

1693
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:41,480
And that's where people get hurt.
No,

1694
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:46,250
but so people need to find what works 
for them basically.

1695
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:47,143
I mean there's all,
there's a lot of schools of thought on 

1696
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:49,131
like,
okay,

1697
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:53,510
for the average person do this and that 
works for most people,

1698
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,523
but it's not going to work for David 
Goggins or depends on your goals and 

1699
01:17:57,171 --> 01:17:58,004
your body and your ability and what 
you're trying to accomplish and your 

1700
01:18:00,561 --> 01:18:01,394
dedication.

1701
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,190
What is the standard routine for someone
who's trying to run an ultra marathon?

1702
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:06,920
So if you're running a marathon a day,
is that,

1703
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,140
is that a normal thing?
Like what do they,

1704
01:18:09,210 --> 01:18:10,890
what do you guys communicate with each 
other?

1705
01:18:10,891 --> 01:18:12,630
Because it was only a handful of yet.
Yeah.

1706
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,820
I don't know.
Have you talked to those people are just

1707
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:16,740
doing what you think you should do?
Yeah,

1708
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,630
I have never talked to anybody about 
training.

1709
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,830
What?
No,

1710
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,903
you don't talk to any of those people.
So you just go out there and do your 

1711
01:18:22,771 --> 01:18:23,604
shit.
Yeah.

1712
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,450
What a freak.
Now I,

1713
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,280
I,
there's guys,

1714
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,770
you know,
there's guys that train,

1715
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:34,120
I'm trying to think of.
Oh Jim Walmsley and he,

1716
01:18:34,121 --> 01:18:36,910
uh,
he's a amazing.

1717
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:39,650
I mean I have zero ability compared to 
this guy.

1718
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:40,484
I think he's about 26.
He lives down in Arizona and he's been 

1719
01:18:43,901 --> 01:18:46,690
trying to break the uh,
western states.

1720
01:18:46,691 --> 01:18:49,570
100 ultra marathon record for two years 
now.

1721
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,433
Last year he was on pace to break it.
He was like at a mile 90 and I don't 

1722
01:18:56,161 --> 01:18:57,960
know,
20,

1723
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,500
40 some minutes ahead.
Of course,

1724
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,830
record pace took the wrong turn because 
this is in the mountains,

1725
01:19:02,831 --> 01:19:07,780
it starts at squaw valley and ends and 
Auburn took her the wrong trail and went

1726
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:12,010
off course and ended up finishing 20th,
you know,

1727
01:19:12,011 --> 01:19:15,550
because he had to backtrack and it's 
mentally broke him.

1728
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,313
So he was going to come back this year 
better than ever and his training and 

1729
01:19:20,711 --> 01:19:25,711
he'd be like running 140 mile weeks,
so 20 miles a day,

1730
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:27,243
a 100,
150 mile weeks or some guys that have 

1731
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,390
that do more than that.
But anyway,

1732
01:19:32,410 --> 01:19:35,470
this year he came in and he went again.
Went ahead.

1733
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:36,773
A was ahead of course record pace and an
ultra marathon term or maybe a running 

1734
01:19:40,811 --> 01:19:44,380
term in general as he blew up at mile 76
I think.

1735
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,300
And had to drop.
She went to hard.

1736
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,160
Yup.
Wow.

1737
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:48,940
So.
And he's,

1738
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,030
he's doing record.
What,

1739
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:52,840
what is he trying to break the record 
for?

1740
01:19:52,841 --> 01:19:57,280
That is like 14 something.
Fourteen hours now.

1741
01:19:57,281 --> 01:19:57,770
What is the,
is that

1742
01:19:57,770 --> 01:20:02,740
there's a guy who just broke the ultra 
marathon record for a flat,

1743
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,560
like a flat 100.
Not In the mountains like you do,

1744
01:20:05,561 --> 01:20:09,630
but a flat one and he's on an off like a
high fat diet.

1745
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,980
Right?
Isn't he on Jamie?

1746
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:11,993
We talked about that guy recently.
He's on a ketogenic diet and he broke 

1747
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:16,463
the was on the track is a 24 hour record
and he ran a 100 and I can't remember 

1748
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,130
how many,
how many miles it was.

1749
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,063
Yeah,
but you felt like maybe for the 

1750
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:30,090
mountains you might want to alter your 
diet.

1751
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:33,750
Like maybe that's not the for me.
Yeah.

1752
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:37,620
I mean have you ever tried to like a fat
based diet or a Ketogenic Diet?

1753
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:40,570
I don't know what you call it,
but my buddies I've,

1754
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:43,950
I lived with back home,
Nick Hammon and Eric Mccormack there.

1755
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:46,890
They both do bodybuilding competitions,
strengths,

1756
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,830
but exactly outlaw strength.

1757
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,350
I love that Guy Dude and nick the 
trainer dude.

1758
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,950
Yeah.
And so to get lean for those shows,

1759
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,173
basically you cut the carbs out and this
is many proteins in Greens as you want 

1760
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:02,183
so you can have salad and steak.
So I've done that and I've got down to 

1761
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:05,634
six percent body fat just to see what it
was like and that's essentially what 

1762
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:09,474
that is.
And do you feel like you perform any 

1763
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:12,890
differently?
Terrible,

1764
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,670
terrible,
terrible.

1765
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,860
It felt terrible about it.
Oh,

1766
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,960
no strength,
no endurance.

1767
01:21:19,050 --> 01:21:20,810
Because no carbs.
Hmm.

1768
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:22,840
So zero carbs like.
No,

1769
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:23,190
no,
no.

1770
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:24,023
Like just vegetables for the know on a 
low carb day it'd be 50 to 75 grams of 

1771
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:29,484
carbs.
Did you ever get your blood sugar check 

1772
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:33,990
to see if your key to genic and.
No.

1773
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,913
No I don't.
It's interesting because I feel I feel 

1774
01:21:37,461 --> 01:21:39,600
like this.
It's very important to talk about that.

1775
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,260
Everybody's body is different.
Yeah.

1776
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,263
You know who's a great proponent of this
is robb wolf and one of the really 

1777
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:47,910
interesting things about rob was a 
scientist and a very,

1778
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:50,520
very smart guy when it comes to 
nutrition and health rights,

1779
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:52,050
about books,
about Paleo diets,

1780
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:53,213
but one of the more interesting things 
that rob does is he will eat the same 

1781
01:21:55,531 --> 01:22:00,270
thing as his wife and they'll both to 
test themselves,

1782
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,133
test their blood and he'll do it on 
video and his wife is consistently more 

1783
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:08,490
adaptive than he is like they're eating 
the same thing like it should,

1784
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:12,680
but but his body for whatever reason,
doesn't perform as well.

1785
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,270
Processing carbohydrates as hers does 
and I say,

1786
01:22:15,360 --> 01:22:19,740
and she didn't stay in a ketogenic state
and eat far more carbs than he can.

1787
01:22:19,770 --> 01:22:22,410
Okay.
I'm gonna let you in on a,

1788
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:24,390
on a little secret.
Oh,

1789
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:27,150
I don't even know what the hell 
ketogenic means.

1790
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:30,840
I've heard Quito,
Quito,

1791
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,703
jet.
I'm like,

1792
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,270
okay,
well what is it?

1793
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,000
Okay.
In a state of Ketosis,

1794
01:22:36,090 --> 01:22:36,923
your body burns off fat instead of 
carbohydrates and you have to have an 

1795
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:42,773
adaptation period where your body goes 
from carbohydrates to fats as a fuel 

1796
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:53,151
source and your brain uses ketones in 
your body,

1797
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:56,640
uses ketones for fuel instead of 
carbohydrates and glucose.

1798
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,520
Is there an advantage?
Yes,

1799
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,130
and I would suggest that anybody who's 
interested in this,

1800
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:05,740
um,
go to my podcast with Dom D'agostino,

1801
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,040
it

1802
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,873
was four months ago maybe,
or Tim Ferriss podcast with Dom 

1803
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:15,160
D'agostino is also an excellent 
resource.

1804
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,260
And there's advantages in terms of the,
uh,

1805
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:21,310
your body's ability to fight off disease
and cancer.

1806
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:24,670
Cognitive ability improves and we'd be 
smarter,

1807
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,170
Bro.
I doubt it.

1808
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:29,680
But could I be better?
What's that?

1809
01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:30,523
Nine 94.
Not episode nine slash 90 for this 

1810
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:34,030
podcast.
And Yeah,

1811
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:36,140
you'd Bowhunt Austin minute.
Well,

1812
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,900
I just think you need a lot of fat 
though.

1813
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,280
And maybe with your diet you're not 
taking in enough fat.

1814
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:45,610
Like you have to have a lot of fat 
animal fat.

1815
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,410
That's the Cahtos yeah,
that's one thing.

1816
01:23:47,411 --> 01:23:50,290
Coconut oil told me the other day 
because I was just like,

1817
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:55,030
we lifted and I'm so weak because I was 
running so much.

1818
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,250
Right.
And so we did it.

1819
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:58,143
We did a just a few quick calculations 
and if you run a marathon a day at my 

1820
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:05,050
way it was.

1821
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,290
And then just living because just 
living,

1822
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:12,310
you're going to burn 1700 calories a day
or me then plus the 3,300

1823
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:15,010
or something that I'd burn when running 
a marathon.

1824
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:18,950
So it was like 5,000
calories and as eating three row,

1825
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:22,030
2000 deficit,
um,

1826
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,320
that's too much.
Yeah.

1827
01:24:23,321 --> 01:24:27,160
So he said I needed to just ramp up the 
fats,

1828
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:29,320
you know,
so it started hammering nuts,

1829
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:31,030
Avocados,
things like that.

1830
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,560
And um,
I actually did.

1831
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:34,870
I was feeling better.
We lifted again and I felt better.

1832
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,793
So I think that's the big part of the 
key to genic died that people get wrong 

1833
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:39,993
is that ketogenic diet is primarily fats
and then you have an adequate amount of 

1834
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:46,570
protein dependent upon how much activity
you do.

1835
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:51,400
You obviously do a lot of activity.
You would need more protein than most.

1836
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:55,090
And I think you would also probably need
more actual carbohydrates in most.

1837
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:56,950
Yeah.
And still stay in Ketosis.

1838
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:57,784
I think if that's probably one of the 
reasons why you were so tired and you 

1839
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:01,054
felt weak.
But also I think this thing that you're 

1840
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:07,750
doing most people are just not going to 
do not going to burn three and eat too.

1841
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:11,410
They're just not going to do print print
for getting ready for 200 mile race.

1842
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:12,710
Yeah.
So it's,

1843
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:16,600
I'm trying to figure it out as I go.
So you don't talk to this is what freaks

1844
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:17,434
me out.
So you don't talk to other ultra 

1845
01:25:18,401 --> 01:25:23,401
marathon people.
I hate people like me.

1846
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,320
I do know,
I like,

1847
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:28,890
I like,
I like a lot of people,

1848
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,560
man.
I like um,

1849
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,940
most people fall short of your 
expectations.

1850
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,410
Yeah,
I like winners.

1851
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,333
I like strong people.
I like people who don't judge other 

1852
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:39,274
people.
I like,

1853
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:41,860
you don't like me,
then I judge everybody know,

1854
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:43,150
judge you,
I just Jamie,

1855
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:48,210
no fucking shirt he's wearing now.
I mean I just don't like complainers.

1856
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,200
Right?
And so there's not a,

1857
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:55,210
there's not a lot of people who,
I'm,

1858
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:58,210
I dunno,
I want to respect people.

1859
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,103
Well,
I think that with the level of output 

1860
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,980
that you are putting out and the amount 
of focus and dedication to these things,

1861
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:08,150
the amount of obsession to performing at
a 200 plus mile race,

1862
01:26:08,990 --> 01:26:13,990
a whiny bullshit that you hear is just 
so much more magnified than what I hear.

1863
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:15,340
Yeah.
You know,

1864
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,500
like if I hear whiny stuff for my seven 
year old,

1865
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:21,890
it becomes funny because I start going 
or you're going to be okay.

1866
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,780
Are you going to be okay?
And she's like,

1867
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:25,040
stop it Daddy.
I go,

1868
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:26,360
what are you going to do?
You're going to beat me up.

1869
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,770
I go,
come on punk.

1870
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,530
And she'll get off the couch and she'll 
kick me and then we'll have a little fun

1871
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:33,320
and play around together.
But she's savvy them.

1872
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,173
Yeah.
If I hear whiny stuff from a grown 

1873
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:36,591
adult,
I'm like,

1874
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:37,424
Jesus fucking Christ.
We live in a world where if it's cold 

1875
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:42,830
out,
you press a button and it gets warm.

1876
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,033
And we live in a world where water.
The thing that keeps us alive that 

1877
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:50,330
people struggled to find in most of the 
free world comes out of a fucking.

1878
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:54,110
You have a lever and you're sinking 
every sink in every bathroom.

1879
01:26:54,111 --> 01:26:56,270
We could just drink fresh water.
Glug,

1880
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:56,871
Glug,
glug,

1881
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:57,530
glug,
glug.

1882
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,110
Think what are you complaining about?
Fuck.

1883
01:26:59,111 --> 01:27:00,110
Are you complaining about them?

1884
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:00,983
Planning about because Joe Rogan and can
go elk hunting here and you can hashtag 

1885
01:27:04,111 --> 01:27:05,040
bullshit.
Yeah,

1886
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:06,090
I mean,
so that's,

1887
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:08,010
that's the kind of stuff that's been 
nice.

1888
01:27:08,070 --> 01:27:08,903
I pretty much don't listen to anybody 
except people who I know share my 

1889
01:27:12,931 --> 01:27:15,480
mindset about not just on running or 
whatever,

1890
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:16,350
just about in life.

1891
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:17,283
Well,
that's why I'm just confused as to why 

1892
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:19,324
you don't have a group of people that 
you're close to that are also ultra 

1893
01:27:22,061 --> 01:27:23,830
marathon runners.
You can compare notes with.

1894
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,960
There's not a lot of people that do 
those.

1895
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:26,531
I mean,
yeah,

1896
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:28,180
ultra.
My brother does ultras.

1897
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,360
My brother is a stud.
So how odd he,

1898
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,893
he,
uh,

1899
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,700
some genetics in that family.
Huh?

1900
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:40,380
Was Your Dad is a big time athlete to 
actually my dad.

1901
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:45,630
I have no talent compared to my dad.
So my dad was an ultra,

1902
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:47,830
just not ultra marathon,
ultra freak.

1903
01:27:47,831 --> 01:27:49,560
He was just an athletic freak.
Um,

1904
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,580
so,
but my,

1905
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,810
my brother,
um,

1906
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,500
he does a lot of miles.
We don't really even,

1907
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:58,150
we just kind of do our own thing.
We know what it takes.

1908
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,373
You got to pound out miles.
You Dad was trying to compete in the 

1909
01:28:00,941 --> 01:28:01,774
Olympics,
right?

1910
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:02,441
No,
no,

1911
01:28:02,441 --> 01:28:02,921
no.
He,

1912
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:07,000
uh,
I think he had Olympic potential.

1913
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,640
So what happened is,
uh,

1914
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,760
he was a high jumper and a long jumper 
and uh,

1915
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:13,191
you know,
I,

1916
01:28:13,191 --> 01:28:14,440
I just,
I took,

1917
01:28:14,441 --> 01:28:19,441
my daughter was doing pole vaulting last
year in and they kinda hurt.

1918
01:28:19,630 --> 01:28:23,710
My Dad was a awesome pole vaulter at 
South Eugene high school.

1919
01:28:23,711 --> 01:28:28,711
He was the first athlete inducted in the
hall of fame and uh,

1920
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:32,490
they did that right before he died.
But uh,

1921
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:36,220
in the south Eugene Hall of Famer,
that high school there in Eugene is,

1922
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:37,540
um,
anyway,

1923
01:28:37,541 --> 01:28:39,340
so he,
uh,

1924
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:43,090
these coaches at where my daughter was 
doing pole vaulting,

1925
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,373
they said,
you know,

1926
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,213
after a few different practices they had
heard about her and me and her grandpa 

1927
01:28:50,021 --> 01:28:51,300
was.
And so he's,

1928
01:28:51,301 --> 01:28:52,660
he comes up and he's like,
he goes,

1929
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:53,513
was your,
uh,

1930
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,870
your dad Bob Haynes?
And I'm like,

1931
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:56,920
yeah.
And he goes,

1932
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,510
uh,
yeah,

1933
01:28:58,511 --> 01:29:01,350
he was a,
he was a legend around here because they

1934
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:03,970
went to high school together and now 
they've been coaching rather.

1935
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,000
And he just said that everybody knew Bob
Hanes and he could do things nobody else

1936
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:09,834
could do and what it is,
I think where he would have his success 

1937
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:17,340
was in high jump and he could high jump 
six four.

1938
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,520
And what he did at that time was called 
the western roll.

1939
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,533
And so you just kinda roll over the bar.
And then he'd competed against Dick 

1940
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:27,840
Fosbury and he invented the Fosbury 
flop.

1941
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:31,470
So you'd go with your back to the bar 
and then kick your legs over.

1942
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,780
And so they would compete.
And my dad got earned a scholarship at,

1943
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:37,733
at Oregon for gymnastics.
And then Oregon State for track when 

1944
01:29:40,441 --> 01:29:41,274
they had track and um,
ended up dropping out of both of both 

1945
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:46,770
schools.
And,

1946
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:49,190
um,
they said that he would,

1947
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:51,990
he get high jumped six floor during the 
western roll.

1948
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:52,824
And they said,
well,

1949
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:53,783
we're going to teach you that the 
Fosbury flop and we should build to add 

1950
01:29:56,551 --> 01:29:57,384
eight to 12 inches onto your jumps.
So that'll put them at seven feet and 

1951
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:04,000
that would have been up there with Dick 
Fosbury and um,

1952
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:05,423
and Dick.
So my dad ended up dropping out of 

1953
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:09,930
school or in whatever happened in I was 
born.

1954
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:11,430
And then my brother was born,
you know,

1955
01:30:11,431 --> 01:30:12,264
how life gets in the way.
And then meanwhile a Dick Fosbury went 

1956
01:30:15,271 --> 01:30:16,104
to the Olympics and won the gold medal.
So it's just who knows what would 

1957
01:30:19,381 --> 01:30:21,750
happen.
But the fact is,

1958
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:23,880
he was an amazing athlete.
You know,

1959
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,753
what,
if you just want to say just in high 

1960
01:30:25,711 --> 01:30:26,544
school,
that's fine.

1961
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:27,540
But,
uh,

1962
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:28,373
you know,
he was a d one athlete in two different 

1963
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:31,590
sports.
So I didn't,

1964
01:30:31,591 --> 01:30:33,870
I never had that.
I don't have that potential.

1965
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,730
What I have is just a hard work ethic.
And um,

1966
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,980
that's what I've translate.
So I,

1967
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:44,250
without the Olympic or without the 
athletic talents,

1968
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:45,084
maybe that he has,
I might have the words work ethic that 

1969
01:30:49,171 --> 01:30:52,920
might match a talent.
And that's what I've used to do.

1970
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:54,930
Ultras because basically that's just 
been tough.

1971
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,780
I mean I think,
I think it was just grinding and,

1972
01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:58,883
and put in miles and training and then 
getting where everybody else wants to 

1973
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:04,860
quit and pushing through in the races.
So you don't.

1974
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:05,983
I have a few friends like I know.
What was the woman's name that runs 

1975
01:31:09,291 --> 01:31:11,390
candice?
Candice Bergen friends with her.

1976
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,450
And he and your friends with your 
brother obviously who also runs ultra?

1977
01:31:14,451 --> 01:31:15,284
Yeah.
Do you have other friends that do this 

1978
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:19,790
that you like email with or text 
message?

1979
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:22,220
No.
One is that normal?

1980
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:25,450
No,
I mean ultra runners in general are,

1981
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:28,690
are a fucking Weirdos,
Weirdos,

1982
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:31,480
but I'm independent.
Right.

1983
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,710
You know,
you have to be,

1984
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,810
you can't rely on anybody,
you know,

1985
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:38,950
you can't see who's going to tell me to 
go run a marathon every day.

1986
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:41,200
Right.
Everybody's gonna say that's too much.

1987
01:31:41,201 --> 01:31:42,034
You don't need to do that.
So it's like ultra runners are 

1988
01:31:44,621 --> 01:31:45,454
independent.
How long have they been doing ultra 

1989
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:49,000
marathons?
Well,

1990
01:31:49,001 --> 01:31:53,800
the western states 100 started in 1974.
Whoa.

1991
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:55,233
And what was the old times like?
What was like a good time back then to 

1992
01:31:57,911 --> 01:31:58,744
do 100?
What they seeing the western states 

1993
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,440
started as a horse race and they still 
do it.

1994
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,440
It's courses yet the [inaudible] Cup and
so it's,

1995
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:10,800
it's the same course with the same goal 
is covered 100 miles in under 24 hours.

1996
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:16,120
So if you do that,
you get the buckle and it says 100 miles

1997
01:32:16,121 --> 01:32:20,140
one day and that's like the gold metal 
full for an ultra runner.

1998
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:26,070
So they have that same thing for horses.
And Gordon Ainslie was,

1999
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:31,300
he was in the horse race,
his horse came up lame and he said,

2000
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,460
well I'm going to finish it on my own,
on his,

2001
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,050
on his feet,
Jesus.

2002
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:36,393
And so he did that and that's where 
western states endurance race or run 

2003
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,370
began because it's like,
well let's just,

2004
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,560
let's just do this on our feet.
What a fucking animal.

2005
01:32:44,561 --> 01:32:45,394
That guy.
Yeah.

2006
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:47,890
And he still competes in the western 
states right now.

2007
01:32:47,891 --> 01:32:49,300
He's.
How old is he?

2008
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:51,110
But he can.
He can't break 20 week.

2009
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,083
He can't even break.
So you can get a buckle 100 miles one 

2010
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:59,521
day if you break 24,
if you break 30 you get a cookie and you

2011
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:02,590
get a buckle up.
Just is western states endurance run.

2012
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:07,510
But if you don't break 30 you get 
nothing.

2013
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:13,330
So he's tried for I think when,
when I ran it in 2010.

2014
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:19,350
God what was he 60 some.
Probably he at the 30 mile cutoff.

2015
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:25,231
He was at like the 90 some mile cutoff.
So the 30 hour cutoff.

2016
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:27,543
Yeah.
And so he was at the 97 mile at 30 

2017
01:33:30,341 --> 01:33:30,920
hours.
So that it,

2018
01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:32,020
he was done.
Right.

2019
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,003
But anyway,
so he tries every year and he gets a 

2020
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:39,040
long way from being 70.
I think he's over 70 now.

2021
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:40,210
Wow.
Yeah.

2022
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:41,343
But anyway,
so he started that and that was in the 

2023
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,450
seventies.
And then nowadays there's more races.

2024
01:33:46,451 --> 01:33:47,284
Every state,
pretty a lot of states out west have 

2025
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,531
hunter,
you know,

2026
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:51,364
that's Kinda the ultra scene is in the 
mountains out here as they do the ones 

2027
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:56,713
the mountains will.
That western states is in the mountains 

2028
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:00,220
and mountains that starts at squaw 
valley.

2029
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:05,200
So it was a lot of elevation,
there's a lot of that race has 41,000

2030
01:34:05,201 --> 01:34:06,370
feet of elevation change.

2031
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:09,080
Wow.
So you're gaining 18,000

2032
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,203
and you're losing 21 overall.
The course goes from squaw valley down 

2033
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:13,654
to Auburn.
But in the course of that it's up and 

2034
01:34:15,581 --> 01:34:16,121
down,
up and down,

2035
01:34:16,121 --> 01:34:16,954
up and down.
And so you're gaining 18 or over the 

2036
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:22,260
course of 100 miles and losing 21 wow.
Or something like that.

2037
01:34:22,261 --> 01:34:23,094
It's 41,000
different and even running down still 

2038
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:28,810
difficult because you're decelerating.
You have to stop your momentum.

2039
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,600
So for us,
a 70 plus year old guy to do that,

2040
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:32,523
that's one thing about.
So you start at that race and they 

2041
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:37,650
always say once you get into the canyon 
there,

2042
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,090
um,
don't bomb downhill too fast,

2043
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:43,000
which is sort of early in the race as 
before mile 50.

2044
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:46,330
But if you bombed down hill too fast in 
the canyons,

2045
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:49,300
you'll blow your quads out.
You won't be finishing the race.

2046
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:51,760
So you pound your quads too much.
So you got to,

2047
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,970
even though you could go fast,
downhill,

2048
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:56,470
you gotta take it easy because you've 
got to preserve your quads.

2049
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,040
So your quads are getting

2050
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,840
used and the decelerating.
Yep.

2051
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,170
Interesting.
Yeah,

2052
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,330
they're getting pounded.
So,

2053
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:04,570
and,
and where we are now.

2054
01:35:04,571 --> 01:35:06,260
And candace,
Bert with her,

2055
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,330
she has um,
thing is.

2056
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:12,860
So she's got bigfoot Tahoe,
Moab.

2057
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,770
Yeah.
She's got three to hundreds.

2058
01:35:16,070 --> 01:35:21,070
So now her thing is too high.
Two hundreds of the or wait 200 years of

2059
01:35:21,401 --> 01:35:23,570
the new 100 or whatever.
But anyway,

2060
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:26,740
it's the next level is $200.
Well,

2061
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,100
yeah,
she calls up to hundreds.

2062
01:35:28,101 --> 01:35:29,650
I'm like 2:38.
Yeah.

2063
01:35:29,651 --> 01:35:32,840
You gotta say to 38 district rounding.
I don't know.

2064
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:34,250
That's silly.
Rounding.

2065
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:35,084
She should call the 2:38.
The Moab to 38 is what it should be 

2066
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:38,421
called.
Jesus.

2067
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:39,740
Candice.
And it's.

2068
01:35:39,770 --> 01:35:40,750
Hey,
it's her race.

2069
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,270
Hate numbers.
It's her radar.

2070
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:46,490
It is Arctic Antarctic ice marathon.
Jesus Christ.

2071
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,840
First of all,
it's only 100 k.

2072
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:49,640
that's what I could do that on his 
hands.

2073
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:51,830
Yeah.
60 slash 62 miles.

2074
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:54,493
Yeah,
I know.

2075
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:55,543
That'd be fun.

2076
01:35:55,820 --> 01:35:56,820
Yeah,
I guess.

2077
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,130
Yeah,
I'm stupid.

2078
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,820
What are,
you don't see anything but white,

2079
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,430
at least Moab.
You're looking at epic landscape.

2080
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:05,820
It's a challenge though,
you know,

2081
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:07,370
so it's,
it's all about the,

2082
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,740
a new challenge.
Now,

2083
01:36:09,741 --> 01:36:13,520
how many people enter into mobe or big 
foot?

2084
01:36:13,521 --> 01:36:14,600
200.
How many people?

2085
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:19,190
Um,
this year when I did it last year,

2086
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:22,250
there was 74.
I think this year there's over 100.

2087
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:25,400
And how many people finish when I did 
it?

2088
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:27,190
Forty seven.
Finished imodium.

2089
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:27,640
Press.
Yeah.

2090
01:36:27,640 --> 01:36:30,090
Most of people.
I mean if you sign up for $200,

2091
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:31,640
it's not like you're doing that on a 
whim.

2092
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:33,103
I mean,
you're prepared a 100 mile on a whim 

2093
01:36:34,670 --> 01:36:35,390
recently.
Yeah.

2094
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:36,590
God,
that was terrible.

2095
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,553
Yeah.
But the idea that you could do a 100 

2096
01:36:39,471 --> 01:36:43,280
mile race on a whim,
it was the most painful pain.

2097
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:46,640
Painful pain is most painful pain I've 
ever felt.

2098
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:50,030
Was that why you started going to a 
marathon a day afterwards?

2099
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:52,610
Yeah,
I mean I just knew that was in a,

2100
01:36:52,700 --> 01:36:55,400
that was the ledger Brisa 24 hour run 
and that was in June.

2101
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:56,151
And I'm like,
God,

2102
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:58,850
I'm behind on my schedule,
on my training.

2103
01:36:58,851 --> 01:37:02,120
I gotta just,
I gotta grind out a big one so I'm like,

2104
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:02,954
I'm going to do it.
So you decided to grind out a big one 

2105
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:07,910
just to boost your training,
just to get you over the hump myself up.

2106
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:08,840
And so,
uh,

2107
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:10,130
why,
how does that benefit you?

2108
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:13,850
Just mentally?
Or does it do it physically as well?

2109
01:37:13,860 --> 01:37:16,250
He asked me questions like that.
It probably doesn't,

2110
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:17,443
but in the time were you thinking like,
this'll get me over the hump and it'll 

2111
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:24,590
get in shape just like Derek's going to 
do it?

2112
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,930
Yeah.
During that race I was turning into,

2113
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:27,793
remember I said I,
most people are weak pussies you became 

2114
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:33,280
a week because he definitely.
So uh,

2115
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:37,340
I was in that race and a feeling 
miserable.

2116
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:38,780
So I had,
I was like,

2117
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:40,700
well,
okay,

2118
01:37:40,701 --> 01:37:43,430
maybe I'll quit at 30 miles.
Thirty miles is still good run,

2119
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:46,280
right?
I hadn't run 30 miles by June,

2120
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:47,880
so I'm like,
okay,

2121
01:37:47,881 --> 01:37:48,714
that's,
I'm just going to say this is just a 

2122
01:37:49,491 --> 01:37:50,324
training day tomorrow I'll go home,
rest up and maybe I'll do another long 

2123
01:37:53,901 --> 01:37:56,160
run.
And that will be good back back because

2124
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:58,380
that's what you need for those,
for those.

2125
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:03,030
The 200 mile races is Moshe running is 
your beat to shit.

2126
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:04,590
So I mean you,
you know,

2127
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,453
you gotta be able to push through.
So the back to back training days are 

2128
01:38:07,111 --> 01:38:07,944
key.
So at 30 miles I was about at six hours 

2129
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,180
and I'm like God,
maybe I feel,

2130
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:20,181
I feel awful,
but maybe I'll quit at 50 so I got to 50

2131
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:23,580
miles and I'm like God,
okay,

2132
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:24,593
maybe I'll run 12 hours.
So at 12 hours as at 61 miles and a is 

2133
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:31,350
at night and night the race starts at 
nine in the morning.

2134
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:35,700
Nine at night I was at 61 miles at 
feeling awful.

2135
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,593
But I'm like Oh my God,
I'm going to be such a pussy if I quit 

2136
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:40,883
because my not because there's anything 
wrong with running a 12 hour race in 

2137
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:45,870
[inaudible] 61 miles.
That's awesome.

2138
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:46,770
That's,
that's,

2139
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:48,900
that's hard.
Super hard.

2140
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:51,810
But for me,
my goal was 24 hours.

2141
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:56,340
I signed up for the 24 hour race,
so 12 hours isn't 24.

2142
01:38:56,610 --> 01:38:57,630
So I'm like,
well,

2143
01:38:58,950 --> 01:38:59,783
I got 12 hours to get 39 miles,
I just did 61 miles in 12 hours so I 

2144
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:07,860
could just milk it out and still get my 
hundred,

2145
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,930
which was my goal,
24 hours,

2146
01:39:09,931 --> 01:39:11,430
100 miles.
So I thought,

2147
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:15,120
well I got,
I got 12 hours to get 39 miles and uh,

2148
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:19,410
it was the worst 12 hours,
but it,

2149
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:21,720
I barely got it.
I mean it was.

2150
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:26,730
So I did 61 and 12 and then it took me,
took me 12 to get the 39,

2151
01:39:26,731 --> 01:39:29,070
but I got 100 miles done and it was,
you know,

2152
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:30,660
wasn't trained up,
wasn't ready,

2153
01:39:30,661 --> 01:39:31,494
but uh,
had all these reasons and I was 

2154
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:34,201
thinking,
I was running,

2155
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:36,300
thinking of all these excuses I could 
say,

2156
01:39:36,301 --> 01:39:40,230
and I can say that I cramped up and you 
know,

2157
01:39:40,231 --> 01:39:42,840
this is a good example of why you 
shouldn't,

2158
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:45,660
what not,
you know,

2159
01:39:45,661 --> 01:39:48,420
push your body passes limit.
And I could just be all,

2160
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:53,070
get all these Kudos for being smart and 
in everybody just say it's okay,

2161
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:54,840
you did great.
But I would know,

2162
01:39:55,470 --> 01:39:56,303
I would know that I pushed out.
So I kept going and didn't you run 13 

2163
01:39:59,341 --> 01:40:00,990
miles the next day?
Yeah,

2164
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:05,380
because you have to.
So,

2165
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,910
so my,
my whole thing was see this

2166
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:08,803
going 200 mile distance and an ultra 
marathon may be healthier than stopping 

2167
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:13,880
at $100.
Holy Shit.

2168
01:40:13,881 --> 01:40:15,410
How does that make sense?
Scroll up.

2169
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,440
The pacing is different for the people 
that studied that.

2170
01:40:18,441 --> 01:40:20,990
We're going just 100 that were going 
slower,

2171
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,460
which led to lots of different 
interesting scroll.

2172
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,550
I could do that.
The reason 200 milers,

2173
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:29,433
uh,
aren't as fatigued as the hundred mile 

2174
01:40:30,561 --> 01:40:34,370
group was due to pacing the tour desk.
Yawns how do you say that?

2175
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:35,383
G E a n t s toward dig.
Gaulle's runner's average three point 

2176
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:42,380
four miles per hour.
During the course.

2177
01:40:42,381 --> 01:40:47,180
While the 100 mile runners took a faster
four point five miles per hour pace.

2178
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:51,560
Rich Roll was saying that was it.
When he runs ultra marathons,

2179
01:40:51,561 --> 01:40:53,980
like when he was training that one of 
keys was never

2180
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,530
get his heart rate over 140 beats per 
minute.

2181
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,611
Yeah.
See,

2182
01:40:57,611 --> 01:40:58,444
I wish I was smart because if I was 
smart I wouldn't go out because like 

2183
01:41:02,231 --> 01:41:03,130
when big foot,
I'm like,

2184
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,790
I'm going to break the course record.
Right.

2185
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,830
So was killing it.
I was up.

2186
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,670
I was ahead by hours.
Really?

2187
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:10,900
Yeah.
Hours.

2188
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,820
But you fucked up at that one place.
We didn't have any water.

2189
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:13,450
Right,
right.

2190
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:16,870
So died.
So if I could go out and be smart,

2191
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:20,700
that's what I'm going to try to.
Do you think he can win this mob?

2192
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:22,880
I Dunno know.
I doubt it.

2193
01:41:23,820 --> 01:41:25,410
I know.
No,

2194
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,880
I mean it's.
Why can't you?

2195
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:33,610
Um,
well there's freaks out there.

2196
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:36,620
I mean like Cameron Hanes.
No,

2197
01:41:36,890 --> 01:41:39,090
I don't think you're a freak.
No,

2198
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,880
I don't.
I just think uh,

2199
01:41:40,910 --> 01:41:43,280
I can push.
I think I'm good at pain management,

2200
01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,840
uh,
or ignoring pain.

2201
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,063
But,
uh,

2202
01:41:46,700 --> 01:41:49,910
I had a lot of confidence when I was 
doing a marathon a day.

2203
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,040
I was,
my confidence was bar.

2204
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:53,730
I've never been able to do that.
I,

2205
01:41:53,731 --> 01:41:54,590
I mean,
I could've done it.

2206
01:41:54,591 --> 01:41:57,420
I just never did it because I just,
I'm,

2207
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:59,860
but isn't season's basically over now 
for you,

2208
01:41:59,890 --> 01:42:02,950
except for doing a little blacktail 
hunting Oregon.

2209
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:05,440
So when will you ramp back up to a 
marathon?

2210
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:06,274
A day?

2211
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:07,953
Well now it's a time of should I do it 
or should I just just think my 

2212
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:14,250
training's

2213
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,083
the bank and manage till the race 
because now I could hammer too hard and 

2214
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:20,680
go into the race.
Fatigued.

2215
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,000
What is the,
what day of the race?

2216
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:25,510
I think it's the 13th of October.
So what does that four weeks.

2217
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:26,800
Three weeks.
What's today?

2218
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:28,240
Three,
three weeks.

2219
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,940
Twenty seconds.
So how will you know?

2220
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,580
What's the right way to do and what's 
the wrong way to do it?

2221
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:36,490
I don't know.
How would you know?

2222
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,650
I don't know.
I wouldn't know.

2223
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:39,513
Nobody knows,
but I was in their ways or people tell 

2224
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:44,380
whether or not they're overtrained they 
monitor.

2225
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,850
Here's what people say.

2226
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:46,953
If you run a marathon,
you should not run another one for six 

2227
01:42:50,111 --> 01:42:53,920
months.
So should I listen to them?

2228
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:56,963
So yeah,
there's really no know because it's so 

2229
01:42:58,201 --> 01:43:00,300
hard on your body and so on and so 
forth.

2230
01:43:00,301 --> 01:43:02,550
So it,
so how do you,

2231
01:43:02,570 --> 01:43:05,430
what,
when you built up to a marathon a day,

2232
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:06,900
how long did it take you to build up to 
that?

2233
01:43:06,901 --> 01:43:09,240
After the 100 mile race,
which was in June,

2234
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:10,170
is that what you said?
June?

2235
01:43:10,171 --> 01:43:11,670
Yeah.
So that's not a lot of time.

2236
01:43:11,671 --> 01:43:12,451
July,
August.

2237
01:43:12,451 --> 01:43:13,284
We're in September.
So you're talking like during July and 

2238
01:43:14,911 --> 01:43:17,000
August you managed to build yourself up 
to a marathon.

2239
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:19,740
And I did a under armour,
had a mayor,

2240
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:23,040
an ultra at mount bachelor in July.

2241
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:23,963
Well I didn't like July 20 something.
So it was about a month after the 24 

2242
01:43:30,171 --> 01:43:31,190
hour race.
I didn't take a day.

2243
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:32,623
I think I took one day off.
So I ran every day from the 24 hour 

2244
01:43:36,891 --> 01:43:41,510
trying to beat my body up and then I 
went into that ultra and I ran that.

2245
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,720
I don't know,
I didn't got,

2246
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:47,750
took the wrong course for a couple of 
miles.

2247
01:43:47,751 --> 01:43:50,570
So I didn't think I got seven.
I don't know what I got,

2248
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:54,500
but that was 100.
Now that was a 50 k,

2249
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:59,320
so that was 31 miles.
And then um,

2250
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:03,920
the next day I ran the south sister,
which is a,

2251
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:07,940
it was 16 miles with 5,000
feet of gain,

2252
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:08,774
so I got really good mountain back to 
back days there with no break after the 

2253
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:13,544
24 hour and then went,
then took a little break I think a day 

2254
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,800
and then started trying to get at really
at least a half marathon a day.

2255
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:28,400
But then I went on a run I think of nine
days where I did a marathon every day.

2256
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:29,623
And so if that time,
if you had asked if I had a chance to 

2257
01:44:31,611 --> 01:44:33,530
win my lab,
I would have said yeah,

2258
01:44:34,060 --> 01:44:34,893
I,
because my confidence was amazing 

2259
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:37,483
because I've never been able to do that.
And maybe I'm not being realistic about 

2260
01:44:40,731 --> 01:44:42,220
it because there could be,
you know,

2261
01:44:42,260 --> 01:44:45,380
Jim Walmsley show up who,
who knows what he could run it in.

2262
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:48,440
And uh,
and so maybe it's not realistic,

2263
01:44:48,441 --> 01:44:50,960
but,
but at that time I had confidence.

2264
01:44:50,961 --> 01:44:54,230
Now after not running that much and 
being gone hunting,

2265
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,153
I don't know.

2266
01:44:56,030 --> 01:44:59,960
So when will you decide when or when we 
decided like how you're going to train,

2267
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,480
like you going to start running tomorrow
when you get back home.

2268
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:06,530
I'll do a marathon tomorrow and then 
once you do a marathon tomorrow I'll see

2269
01:45:06,531 --> 01:45:09,800
how I feel.
But in my body feels awesome right now.

2270
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:11,360
Yeah,
you're rested up.

2271
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:12,283
Oh God.
I feel I feel as good as I felt in a 

2272
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:16,880
long time right now.
Well that was the idea though,

2273
01:45:16,881 --> 01:45:19,070
right?
That you were going to train super hard.

2274
01:45:19,071 --> 01:45:19,904
Beat yourself up and then take a few 
weeks off for hunting and he would 

2275
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:22,970
recover and recuperate.

2276
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:24,900
Yep.
Looked good on paper.

2277
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:25,680
Yeah.
Well,

2278
01:45:25,680 --> 01:45:26,513
when you,
uh,

2279
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:28,133
when you run that marathon tomorrow,
you're going to feel like a fucking 

2280
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:33,510
animal even better than before.
Maybe I won't.

2281
01:45:33,570 --> 01:45:34,590
Invigorated.
Well,

2282
01:45:34,650 --> 01:45:35,281
come on.
What's,

2283
01:45:35,281 --> 01:45:38,490
what the negative self doubt talked.
Now I'm not,

2284
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:41,280
it's not,
it's just how it is sometimes.

2285
01:45:41,550 --> 01:45:42,383
Do you think there's any advantage to 
your diet that you eat all this wild 

2286
01:45:45,331 --> 01:45:46,164
game?

2287
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,503
Yeah.

2288
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,610
There's gotta be like some sort of end 
up with anything.

2289
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:55,600
Do I can just say science,
but I think it's,

2290
01:45:56,710 --> 01:46:01,210
it's obvious like I was cutting up some 
meat and my wife was looking at it.

2291
01:46:01,211 --> 01:46:03,250
She goes,
it almost looks like organ meat.

2292
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,200
Yeah.
Because it's,

2293
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:05,640
it's so rich.
I mean,

2294
01:46:05,641 --> 01:46:10,140
it's dark as dark and rich.
It's like if,

2295
01:46:10,141 --> 01:46:10,974
uh,
if you're not used to eating that type 

2296
01:46:13,651 --> 01:46:16,380
of me,
it can affect your stomach because it's,

2297
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:21,410
it's so it's rich protein and so it's 
definitely more.

2298
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:25,103
I don't want that

2299
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:28,330
more nutrient dense and I want to say 
potent almost then,

2300
01:46:28,331 --> 01:46:29,980
right than like a steak you'd buy at a 
store.

2301
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,840
Like dolce always likes to use that 
word,

2302
01:46:31,870 --> 01:46:34,630
nutrient dense.
I love it's super smart.

2303
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:35,653
Um,
but if you look at the protein per 

2304
01:46:38,171 --> 01:46:40,040
ounce,
like they do,

2305
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,500
there's a chart,
Jamie,

2306
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:43,090
that they do,
um,

2307
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:45,430
they compare beef,
chicken,

2308
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,820
salmon and elk and Moose and it's off 
the charts.

2309
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:50,100
It's double.
So

2310
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,130
you could get the same amount of protein
that you get in a 16 ounce steak,

2311
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:55,410
I think in like an eight ounce piece of 
elk.

2312
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,040
So you need less and it's more potent 
and it just,

2313
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,420
it just looks different.
You know,

2314
01:47:01,450 --> 01:47:04,530
I've,
I've shown it to friends that have never

2315
01:47:04,531 --> 01:47:09,030
eaten out before the like Jesus because 
it's just read it just,

2316
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,160
just dense,
you know,

2317
01:47:11,161 --> 01:47:14,100
you're eating a super athlete and that's
what it's like.

2318
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:14,963
No,
and that's what I feel like I feel like 

2319
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:17,640
when I'm eating at,
you know,

2320
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:21,330
those elk are amazing animals,
powerful,

2321
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:24,060
strong endurance.
Um,

2322
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:25,133
you know,
everything I would like to be as far as 

2323
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:31,890
of taking on anything that happens and 
uh,

2324
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:33,050
you know,
when you eat it,

2325
01:47:33,050 --> 01:47:33,883
how could you not have confidence or 
feel better by just think it's the best 

2326
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:38,340
food for you?
I really do.

2327
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:40,530
I mean,
I feel fucking fantastic.

2328
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:44,190
I feel better now at 50 than I've ever 
felt like probably in my life.

2329
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,140
Right.
I feel better at 50 than I did at 40.

2330
01:47:46,530 --> 01:47:47,190
Really?
Yeah,

2331
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:48,023
for sure.
Definitely just brought a lot of it is 

2332
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,160
eating really healthy,
really running,

2333
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:55,040
managing my,
um,

2334
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,820
my sleep,
that's a big one.

2335
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:57,683
That's one that you don't do that very 
good and you don't really get a lot of 

2336
01:47:59,470 --> 01:48:01,680
sleep.
It's that stupid job.

2337
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,220
I'm supposed to be at work right now.
So when you get to Friday,

2338
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:07,083
but you make more money outside your 
stupid job than you do on your stupid 

2339
01:48:09,271 --> 01:48:10,104
job.

2340
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:13,800
Son,
I need to manage.

2341
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:16,800
You need to listen to me.
Yeah.

2342
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:20,130
Every time we talk about this we do,
we talk about it a lot.

2343
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:21,773
You're the opposite of me in that regard
because I'm like captain cut ties and 

2344
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:29,580
burned the bridge and fucking throw 
kerosene on the house.

2345
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:31,800
Light on fire and drive away.
Woo.

2346
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,510
Yeah.
And you're not.

2347
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:35,100
I know.
Opposite.

2348
01:48:35,610 --> 01:48:36,570
Yeah.
I'm a,

2349
01:48:37,230 --> 01:48:38,580
you know,
in part of it is,

2350
01:48:38,581 --> 01:48:40,260
um,
I've never,

2351
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,153
like I said,
I've never felt special so I've always 

2352
01:48:42,931 --> 01:48:47,510
feel like I should appreciate having a 
good job and uh,

2353
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,473
I'm loyal to,
to where I work and so I feel like all 

2354
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:53,094
this opportunity and these things that I
do and being on your show and all that 

2355
01:48:56,911 --> 01:48:58,240
could go away tomorrow.
And then,

2356
01:48:58,241 --> 01:48:59,760
uh,
if I quit the job I'd be like,

2357
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,900
Oh my God,
I knew it.

2358
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:01,920
I'm going to fricking loser.

2359
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:02,753
And I quit it.
The best job I've ever had in my entire 

2360
01:49:04,141 --> 01:49:06,390
life.
And that's an interesting way of looking

2361
01:49:06,391 --> 01:49:08,610
at it.
But it's,

2362
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:13,620
I'm part of your strength is the fact 
that you can endure.

2363
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,083
Right?
And so I think you're in during this 

2364
01:49:18,031 --> 01:49:21,150
job.
Maybe I like being miserable,

2365
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:23,550
but I'm not because I liked the people 
at work.

2366
01:49:24,090 --> 01:49:26,550
Do you do,
but you would like it more if you didn't

2367
01:49:26,551 --> 01:49:27,900
have to be there.
Yeah,

2368
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:30,000
I would like just to check in with them 
every once in a while.

2369
01:49:30,001 --> 01:49:31,020
Hey,
how's everybody?

2370
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:31,854
Yeah.
How's,

2371
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:34,650
how's that place where I used to work 
for my whole life?

2372
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:36,391
Yeah.
I mean,

2373
01:49:36,391 --> 01:49:37,440
so I,
I missed.

2374
01:49:37,441 --> 01:49:40,100
I miss the people when I'm not there.
I'm,

2375
01:49:40,290 --> 01:49:43,290
I miss problem solving and,
and,

2376
01:49:43,291 --> 01:49:44,760
uh,
helping people,

2377
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:45,960
um,
you know,

2378
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,070
achieve goals.
So I,

2379
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,903
I like being there for that.
I've been thinking about this a lot and 

2380
01:49:50,951 --> 01:49:53,320
I've been trying to figure out what,
what a solution is,

2381
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:57,040
but you know,
maybe we could talk to a hoyt about this

2382
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:58,720
or some,
you know,

2383
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:01,840
some company about this,
maybe you under armour,

2384
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:03,273
but the idea of putting together like 
almost like camps where people could 

2385
01:50:09,431 --> 01:50:13,150
learn archery and maybe you could give 
seminars.

2386
01:50:13,240 --> 01:50:15,790
Guys like Dudley can show some archery 
techniques.

2387
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:20,080
Guys like Remy Warren can talk about 
things and putting together these almost

2388
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:22,590
like introductory camps.
Yeah,

2389
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:24,550
where people don't know where to start 
or where to start.

2390
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:26,920
I didn't know where to start.
If it wasn't for Steve Rinella,

2391
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:28,900
I would've never got to start in 
hunting.

2392
01:50:28,980 --> 01:50:31,380
It wasn't for you.
I would've never got started behind.

2393
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:32,703
It's just sometimes you need someone and
there's not a lot of resources out 

2394
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:36,514
there,
but there's a lot of people that are 

2395
01:50:36,671 --> 01:50:37,140
listening.

2396
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:39,380
There's a lot of people that they're 
hearing all this and that,

2397
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:40,750
wow,
this sounds crazy.

2398
01:50:40,751 --> 01:50:42,670
Like I want to get involved in this,
and again,

2399
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:44,013
a lot of what we're talking about,
like I was talking about Brian Barney's 

2400
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:46,593
podcast,
like he's hunting public land over the 

2401
01:50:49,031 --> 01:50:52,060
counter tags in Montana.
You could go get them.

2402
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,980
They don't cost that much.
You Go,

2403
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:57,910
you pay your license fee,
he buy a tag and you can go out into the

2404
01:50:57,911 --> 01:50:58,744
wilderness.
You just need a tent and a backpack and 

2405
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:03,520
a bow and Arrow and guts and just go out
there and you could.

2406
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:04,770
You could handle it.
There's,

2407
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:05,643
there's,
there's a lot of opportunity like that 

2408
01:51:07,030 --> 01:51:07,863
in this country is amazing for that.
It's one of the few countries in the 

2409
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:10,834
world where we have literally millions 
of acres of public land that are all 

2410
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:14,464
yours and mine and I was wearing that 
back country hunters and anglers tee 

2411
01:51:17,441 --> 01:51:19,470
shirt yesterday that says public land 
owner.

2412
01:51:19,500 --> 01:51:22,460
Yeah.
We're all public land owners and it's,

2413
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,680
it's,
it's a very,

2414
01:51:23,681 --> 01:51:27,940
very important thing to support and it 
is an amazing resource.

2415
01:51:27,941 --> 01:51:29,650
So yeah,
like where we're at.

2416
01:51:29,651 --> 01:51:32,500
Utah is super rare and not a lot of 
people get to go there,

2417
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:34,450
but guess what?
You could go to Idaho,

2418
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:35,343
Idaho.
You can go into the back country in 

2419
01:51:37,481 --> 01:51:40,780
Idaho and get amazing public land 
hunting.

2420
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:45,580
If you're willing to hike in and go deep
and you go to google earth and you could

2421
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,414
go in and look at all these basins and 
mountains and you could go online and 

2422
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:53,470
ask people and there's ways to move 
around.

2423
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:54,333
There's ways to do this,
but getting started is insanely 

2424
01:51:57,101 --> 01:51:57,934
difficult and I've been thinking about 
this that maybe we could do something 

2425
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:02,441
like,
you know,

2426
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:05,230
how they have that total archery 
challenge that they did in Utah.

2427
01:52:05,290 --> 01:52:06,880
What were there I was is awesome.

2428
01:52:06,910 --> 01:52:07,743
Amazing.
Right.

2429
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,583
So maybe there's like a gathering that 
we could put together like maybe once a 

2430
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,980
year,
maybe during the off season,

2431
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:19,390
just once a year where people can get 
maybe fitted for a bow.

2432
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,470
You sign up for this in advance and 
maybe it's a couple day thing,

2433
01:52:23,490 --> 01:52:28,490
like maybe one or two days where you go 
through an introductory course of,

2434
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:29,513
of archery,
understanding it and then maybe someone 

2435
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:37,090
can talk about shot placement and maybe 
someone else like someone who does a lot

2436
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:37,924
of soul hunting,
like remy or maybe even Adam can talk 

2437
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:41,044
about like woodsmanship and things that 
you can learn and here's some books you 

2438
01:52:44,441 --> 01:52:45,274
could read like your book back country.
What was your country bowhunting and 

2439
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,870
that's still in print,
right?

2440
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:52,490
Because to by that,
is it on Amazon?

2441
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,900
No,
it's on Cameron Hanes.com.

2442
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,210
Au put,
powerful shout out to Cameron Hanes.com,

2443
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:00,490
but to have those kinds of things like 
s,

2444
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:01,880
like set out like,
Hey,

2445
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:05,190
this is something you can do,
this is something you could read.

2446
01:53:05,220 --> 01:53:07,110
This is something you can listen to be 
awesome.

2447
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:09,210
I mean,
we've done gatherings,

2448
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:11,340
you know,
Wayne at the Iraq,

2449
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:12,330
he,
we used to do this,

2450
01:53:12,331 --> 01:53:13,164
bell hunters,
I can't remember what we used to call 

2451
01:53:14,551 --> 01:53:15,384
it,
but six or 700 people would show up at 

2452
01:53:17,071 --> 01:53:18,690
the sale rack in the parking lot,
big tent.

2453
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,033
And we do things.
We could do it out where I practice out 

2454
01:53:22,381 --> 01:53:23,910
of his property,
you know,

2455
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,043
um,
and get together and have people in and 

2456
01:53:27,391 --> 01:53:29,190
it would just be,
it would be amazing.

2457
01:53:29,250 --> 01:53:30,083
Why don't we do that.
The reason I know that there's so much 

2458
01:53:33,301 --> 01:53:34,134
interest in Pat,
my book back country Bolony and I wrote 

2459
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:41,601
in 2006 cases of that go out every day.
I mean,

2460
01:53:41,611 --> 01:53:46,020
before I left on this hunt,
I sat at my kitchen table and sign books

2461
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:47,280
for on,
uh,

2462
01:53:47,281 --> 01:53:50,280
cases of books because those are all 
going to be gone when I get home.

2463
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,760
Do you have a time machine,
a time machine?

2464
01:53:54,570 --> 01:53:56,100
Why?
Where do you get the time?

2465
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,063
I don't understand how the fuck you have
time to run a marathon and then signed 

2466
01:54:00,741 --> 01:54:05,210
books and then practice bowhunting.
Do 100 reps and fucking this.

2467
01:54:05,211 --> 01:54:06,044
And I've done that with your family than
dinner and go to sleep and then work a 

2468
01:54:08,931 --> 01:54:10,220
full time job and then

2469
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:12,840
he is tough.
But uh,

2470
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:16,860
but that's how I know that um,
there's so much interest in that is that

2471
01:54:16,861 --> 01:54:18,390
book is,
you know,

2472
01:54:18,780 --> 01:54:19,613
I think sold almost 40,000
of them and people have that dream just 

2473
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:27,150
you have to.
Oh Nice.

2474
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,700
Um,
and uh,

2475
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:35,370
I just,
I'm a good example of people living that

2476
01:54:35,371 --> 01:54:36,720
dream.
This guy at work,

2477
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:37,733
two guys at my work,
they wanted to do the back country 

2478
01:54:39,931 --> 01:54:43,140
thing.
So we got maps and Wyoming.

2479
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:45,840
I said,
here's [inaudible].

2480
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:46,703
Roy went there at one time,
I've killed a couple of bowls in the 

2481
01:54:48,301 --> 01:54:49,134
back country.
Their public land is a pretty easy tag 

2482
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:52,230
draw.
You can get a,

2483
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,970
you put in for the,
for the premium tag.

2484
01:54:54,971 --> 01:54:55,804
It costs a little more to put in,
but the odds of getting it or you can 

2485
01:54:58,891 --> 01:55:01,200
get it on.
I got it almost every year,

2486
01:55:01,201 --> 01:55:04,050
a couple times and then or a year in 
between.

2487
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,290
And so they put in for the tag.
They got the tag.

2488
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,770
I sat down with him,
said showed them the drainage's,

2489
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:13,050
showed them I'd hunt here,
I'd camp here,

2490
01:55:13,051 --> 01:55:14,940
I do this.
And they went in there,

2491
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,133
killed a bull.
I mean public land never been there 

2492
01:55:18,901 --> 01:55:22,680
before.
I had a dream of doing it.

2493
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:24,420
Made it happen.
So it's,

2494
01:55:24,450 --> 01:55:27,030
it happens guys do it every year.
It can be done.

2495
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:27,930
Yeah,
for sure.

2496
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:28,993
Can go from the beginning.
From no knowledge of archery to 

2497
01:55:31,331 --> 01:55:32,490
eventually doing it.
Yep.

2498
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,640
And stomps.
Done it.

2499
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:34,720
I know,
I know.

2500
01:55:34,721 --> 01:55:36,820
He texted me today and he's a fucking 
animal.

2501
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:38,750
Yeah.
I love Andy's Austin.

2502
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:42,370
He got obsessed with bowhunting from 
listening to us talk about it.

2503
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:43,860
We'll was talking archery.

2504
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,990
He got a toy.
He got set up.

2505
01:55:45,991 --> 01:55:48,060
Dudley gave him some coaching.
I know you hang.

2506
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:48,953
You hung out with them and he went 
hunting with Dudley and he got a giant 

2507
01:55:52,441 --> 01:55:53,880
fucking black bear.
Two of them.

2508
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:55,650
He got.
He got a bear.

2509
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:58,290
He killed a couple of days.
Yeah.

2510
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,120
Oh,
excuse me.

2511
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:04,260
And then he,
he went on a bad run.

2512
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:07,590
Had a frustrating elocon centralized.
Yeah.

2513
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:09,750
Five shots.
But he did a podcast,

2514
01:56:09,751 --> 01:56:10,800
I guess,
about it today.

2515
01:56:10,801 --> 01:56:12,930
He,
he told me that today's podcast,

2516
01:56:12,931 --> 01:56:13,764
I think it's about failure and about bow
hunting and about failure and a cleared 

2517
01:56:17,941 --> 01:56:19,330
hot.
This is a name of his pocket,

2518
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,400
cleared hot.
But,

2519
01:56:20,810 --> 01:56:21,840
um,
man,

2520
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:23,730
I love that guy.
I told him I'm on the way home.

2521
01:56:23,731 --> 01:56:25,500
I was going to listen to his podcast 
today.

2522
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:26,910
He said he,
he talked about,

2523
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:30,240
he mentioned to me or something like 
that for people who don't know.

2524
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:32,910
He's been on the podcast before and he 
is,

2525
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:33,744
um,
he's a retired navy seal who has the 

2526
01:56:36,541 --> 01:56:37,374
world record holder in the distance of 
one of those fucking crazy squirrel 

2527
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:43,890
suits.
He's a maniac.

2528
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:47,220
He's a real maniac.
And he's become completely obsessed with

2529
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:48,390
bow hunting.
In fact,

2530
01:56:48,391 --> 01:56:50,280
moved to Montana.
Yeah,

2531
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:51,810
that's how savage that guy is.
He's like,

2532
01:56:51,811 --> 01:56:53,250
fuck this,
I'm out of California,

2533
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,420
moves his family from San Diego to 
Montana and he's doing,

2534
01:56:57,421 --> 01:56:58,254
you know,
over the counter what Montana is one of 

2535
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:00,354
the best places in the world where you 
can get over the counter tags for elk 

2536
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:04,524
hunting.
Yeah.

2537
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:05,900
And just the wilderness.
They're like,

2538
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,760
I told you when I went there last summer
with my family,

2539
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:14,060
we had to stop the car and I brought by 
nose and I was given it to my kids.

2540
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:15,180
I'm like,
look,

2541
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:15,461
look,
look,

2542
01:57:15,461 --> 01:57:15,930
look,
look,

2543
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:18,000
there's 100 elk out here in this field.

2544
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:20,250
And we were just sitting there staring 
for like,

2545
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,233
Shit.
We pulled over for like a half an hour 

2546
01:57:22,170 --> 01:57:25,200
just looking out the window at a hundred
hours just hanging out on this field.

2547
01:57:25,490 --> 01:57:26,970
It was amazing.
Yeah.

2548
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:28,560
Uh,
Montana's awesome.

2549
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:29,320
No,
no,

2550
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:30,180
Andy,
he was,

2551
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,970
wasn't he seal for 17 years?
Yeah,

2552
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:34,260
I mean,
so just savage stud.

2553
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,990
Just a great guy too.
You know,

2554
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:38,163
just got a great mind for success and 
this is why he became obsessed with bow 

2555
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:44,280
hunting as well.
It's like he,

2556
01:57:44,310 --> 01:57:49,020
he recognized the things that we were 
talking about and he decided to start it

2557
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,213
to start the process and see what it was
like and then immediately became 

2558
01:57:52,741 --> 01:57:53,600
obsessed.
Yeah.

2559
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,840
And then as we talked about also hit.
I mean,

2560
01:57:57,841 --> 01:57:58,680
it's tough.
Yeah.

2561
01:57:58,681 --> 01:57:59,670
He had a hard time.
Yeah.

2562
01:57:59,810 --> 01:58:02,730
I mean he had some good success when 
Dudley was coaching him.

2563
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:03,623
Is that his place there to get that many
people have asked why we moved to 

2564
01:58:07,291 --> 01:58:08,640
Montana and the other questions.

2565
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:10,380
The only regret is not making the move 
sooner.

2566
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:11,910
Yeah.
Look at that view.

2567
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,260
I know.
It's insane.

2568
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,210
Alex.
he's just got his truck parked there and

2569
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,250
saw some amazing,
amazing view.

2570
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,293
He said something.
I think I saw common lake kind of looks 

2571
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:24,330
like it has a yard.
No fucking Amen.

2572
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:25,890
Yeah,
that's amazing.

2573
01:58:25,891 --> 01:58:27,810
I think he said something about,
um,

2574
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:30,530
and maybe it was on that queered hot,
that other posts there.

2575
01:58:30,531 --> 01:58:31,980
The second post.
Yeah,

2576
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:33,780
about that.
Maybe on his last shot,

2577
01:58:33,781 --> 01:58:38,781
he would have been better off throwing 
his bow one week a to two in one week of

2578
01:58:40,021 --> 01:58:42,190
choice.
I have to take in talking about failure

2579
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:43,023
in episode 13,
I had one of the best weeks I've ever 

2580
01:58:44,591 --> 01:58:46,240
had.
I have in a long time.

2581
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:49,990
My mind kept drifting back to motivation
and purpose,

2582
01:58:49,991 --> 01:58:52,570
which my opinion is the opposite side of
the coin.

2583
01:58:52,571 --> 01:58:53,404
That failure sits on,
hopefully something in it clicks for 

2584
01:58:55,871 --> 01:58:57,070
you.
So this is,

2585
01:58:57,071 --> 01:58:57,904
um,
he's talking about his episode of a 

2586
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:03,580
cleared hottest podcast,
which is an excellent podcast.

2587
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:08,581
She go and check that shit out.
He's just good at verbalizing and I mean

2588
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:12,340
it's just so easy to listen to.
He's a very smart dude.

2589
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:14,640
So that's him out there with his bow.
Yeah,

2590
01:59:14,641 --> 01:59:15,940
just to.
And he says he.

2591
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:19,660
What did he say about humble pie?
That's bell hunting right there.

2592
01:59:19,930 --> 01:59:20,763
Well,
it's fucking hard and anytime you think 

2593
01:59:23,291 --> 01:59:24,580
you're good.
Yeah.

2594
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:26,433
So I mean,
something happens and you just feel 

2595
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,520
like,
I don't know.

2596
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,070
Well,
you know,

2597
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:30,903
Douglas talked about that,
like Dudley who was a guy who literally 

2598
01:59:34,451 --> 01:59:38,590
gets flown out to Europe to coach 
international teams.

2599
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:39,423
He's coached Olympic teams.
He was talking about like one time he 

2600
01:59:42,831 --> 01:59:45,730
went with an outfitter and he just 
hadn't been practicing enough.

2601
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:48,970
He felt like he was fine and he just 
fucking missing.

2602
01:59:49,530 --> 01:59:50,310
He's like,
what?

2603
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:52,150
And he's like,
he took a whole day.

2604
01:59:52,420 --> 01:59:53,170
He goes,
look,

2605
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:54,790
tomorrow we're not going out.
And he goes,

2606
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:58,570
I'm just going to sit here and I'm going
to put up a fucking block target and I'm

2607
01:59:58,571 --> 02:00:00,550
going to practice.
I'm going to get my mind,

2608
02:00:00,590 --> 02:00:01,423
get back on.
And then he got back on track and then 

2609
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:05,230
the next day killed really next time 
shooting.

2610
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:06,064
Perfect.
But it's like he needed to have that 

2611
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:10,600
wake up call that even though he's John 
fucking Dudley,

2612
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:14,140
world class professional archer,
if you don't practice,

2613
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:15,590
it doesn't matter the,
the,

2614
02:00:15,591 --> 02:00:16,424
the,
the Arrow doesn't care to animals don't 

2615
02:00:19,091 --> 02:00:20,880
care if you think you're a bad 
motherfucker.

2616
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:23,710
It doesn't mean you have to have 100 
percent dedication,

2617
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:25,990
100 percent focus all the time.

2618
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:27,153
And that was one of the things that I 
really loved about this week is that 

2619
02:00:30,371 --> 02:00:33,160
even though there was times that it was 
kind of,

2620
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:34,503
it was exhausting for sure.
And there was times it can be kind of 

2621
02:00:36,941 --> 02:00:41,440
frustrating where you're on an animal.
Like I didn't feel frustrated.

2622
02:00:41,441 --> 02:00:45,340
Like I wanted to quit,
I felt frustrated like I wanted to press

2623
02:00:45,341 --> 02:00:48,070
on and I wanted to get successful 
income.

2624
02:00:48,490 --> 02:00:51,640
Being friends with guys like you guys 
like remy,

2625
02:00:51,940 --> 02:00:54,940
Adam Green Tree.
Just knowing these people that have done

2626
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:58,270
all this and gone through all this 
already,

2627
02:00:58,850 --> 02:01:01,300
just.
And also for people that are listening,

2628
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:02,313
having podcasts where people like you or
like remy or Steven Rinella can talk 

2629
02:01:08,621 --> 02:01:11,460
about the struggle.
Yeah.

2630
02:01:11,590 --> 02:01:13,030
It's so important,
right?

2631
02:01:13,130 --> 02:01:16,270
Because what gets attention is this 
success.

2632
02:01:16,330 --> 02:01:17,710
Yeah.
Like when you watch a TV show,

2633
02:01:17,711 --> 02:01:20,350
what do you see guys shooting animals so
easy.

2634
02:01:20,710 --> 02:01:21,490
Yeah,
it does.

2635
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:23,210
Because you get,
you get a TV shows,

2636
02:01:23,230 --> 02:01:24,063
21 minutes,
you got some sponsors you've got to 

2637
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:26,344
mention,
you get a few minutes of hunting and 

2638
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:28,803
I'll hear they killed something.
That's one of the things that I'm 

2639
02:01:30,311 --> 02:01:33,220
worried about with these films because 
these films are brilliant.

2640
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:36,160
Like your film,
that time film that under armour made.

2641
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:38,830
They're brilliant.
But man,

2642
02:01:38,831 --> 02:01:41,090
it seems like everything just kind of 
happened in that.

2643
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:43,190
Like all of a sudden there's the elk.
You passed up,

2644
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:44,270
you were at full job.
Nah,

2645
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:46,520
not that one too young,
and then there's a perfect one.

2646
02:01:47,120 --> 02:01:49,100
Perfect shot.
He's down in seconds.

2647
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,140
Everybody's happy,
but that's not.

2648
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:52,393
That's not the thing.
The thing is the hours and hours and 

2649
02:01:56,060 --> 02:02:00,200
hours of hiking and the disappointment,
the fucking wind goddess,

2650
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:01,163
goddammit.
Like we were in on this bowl and the 

2651
02:02:02,511 --> 02:02:05,750
wind shifted and the cows go milk the 
cows.

2652
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:09,050
Bark bark for people don't know a cow 
elk.

2653
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:13,610
When they hear things or smell things 
and see things and they know something's

2654
02:02:13,611 --> 02:02:14,444
wrong,
they go

2655
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:20,050
and it reverberates through the woods 
and everybody knows what that sound is.

2656
02:02:20,421 --> 02:02:21,254
Sucks of fat Dick.
Everybody went when a cow wouldn't just 

2657
02:02:24,471 --> 02:02:27,980
one cow something or smell something 
barks.

2658
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:29,510
Everybody's like,
oh,

2659
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:31,430
I mean that was it.
It's over.

2660
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,470
There was a time,

2661
02:02:32,690 --> 02:02:36,570
Jamison and Colton and I,
before I killed that bull.

2662
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:40,320
We were standing there dead still for 
five minutes.

2663
02:02:40,321 --> 02:02:43,710
What?
Cows are just staring at us just staring

2664
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:46,320
and you're not moving like your feet are
going numb.

2665
02:02:46,321 --> 02:02:49,590
Your knee hurts because you're kind of 
like leaning on the side of a hill.

2666
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:50,813
You can't move.
You just get to stay and they're just 

2667
02:02:52,771 --> 02:02:55,440
looking right at you because for them,
look,

2668
02:02:55,441 --> 02:02:56,460
for me,
it's a pursuit.

2669
02:02:56,461 --> 02:02:57,560
It's a discipline.
It's,

2670
02:02:57,561 --> 02:02:58,231
it's,
it's.

2671
02:02:58,231 --> 02:03:01,080
I don't want to say fun.
It's exhilarating and intense.

2672
02:03:01,081 --> 02:03:03,110
It's amazing.
It says that I'm attracted to it.

2673
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:07,530
For them it's life and death and they 
don't have a language.

2674
02:03:07,531 --> 02:03:10,920
They don't have a brain that processes 
all these variables.

2675
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:13,470
They just know that's fucking danger.
Yeah.

2676
02:03:13,471 --> 02:03:14,750
It might be dangerous.
That's not.

2677
02:03:14,790 --> 02:03:17,400
Is that something that looks to eat me?
They know they're delicious.

2678
02:03:19,860 --> 02:03:20,693
They must,

2679
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:22,080
yeah.
Um,

2680
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:23,603
one one thing you know,
on that hunt and we had basically a 

2681
02:03:27,891 --> 02:03:31,400
lifetime worth of experience for a lot 
of guys in a week,

2682
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:33,190
you know,
up there and um,

2683
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:35,690
because the,
the timing was perfect.

2684
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:36,623
It,
there's a few reasons why it was a 

2685
02:03:37,401 --> 02:03:41,000
perfect storm up there is the weather 
was a storm obviously,

2686
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:42,500
but a lot of snow.
It was awesome.

2687
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:45,230
Yeah.
One day we got hammered with snow,

2688
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:46,243
but the moon phase,
the moon was basically nonexistent the 

2689
02:03:51,830 --> 02:03:52,663
last few days.
And that's a big thing when the moon is 

2690
02:03:53,361 --> 02:03:55,310
full.
Animals are out at night feeding.

2691
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:59,200
Most of their feeding is done at night 
and a little bit during the day to.

2692
02:03:59,370 --> 02:04:01,380
I'm on this week,
they're,

2693
02:04:01,381 --> 02:04:02,214
the moon phase was down,
so they were feeding mostly out during 

2694
02:04:05,721 --> 02:04:06,800
the day.
So that was big.

2695
02:04:06,801 --> 02:04:07,634
The weather was good and then at the 
time of year so that the bulls were 

2696
02:04:09,561 --> 02:04:10,394
reading.

2697
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:14,720
But um,
I just remember one specific and I can't

2698
02:04:14,721 --> 02:04:17,540
wait to show this on the film,
but we were,

2699
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:20,030
there was a bowl bukedde when we heard 
it up there in the,

2700
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:22,160
in the quake ease.
And he was going crazy.

2701
02:04:22,161 --> 02:04:24,290
We want to try to get a good look at 
them.

2702
02:04:24,650 --> 02:04:29,650
So we're standing there and mark womack,
who sub segments his company,

2703
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:32,270
he was filming me and he looks over and 
he says,

2704
02:04:32,271 --> 02:04:32,851
he says,
Ken,

2705
02:04:32,851 --> 02:04:36,590
there's bull bedded right there.
And it was about a little over 100 yards

2706
02:04:36,591 --> 02:04:40,340
away.
There was a six by six bedded and uh,

2707
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:41,273
with the wind the way it was a Michael,
I'm going to go see how close I can get 

2708
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:44,874
to them.
So I snuck up there and got within 10 

2709
02:04:47,851 --> 02:04:51,840
feet of this six by six bowl and I got 
so close,

2710
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:55,750
there was a,
there was a tree blocking his,

2711
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:57,300
his eye wear.

2712
02:04:57,330 --> 02:04:58,880
Normally he'd be able to see me,
but he,

2713
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:01,440
where he bedded the tree was blocking 
that.

2714
02:05:01,441 --> 02:05:06,441
So I use that tree and uses the cover of
the wind to get in close and that's on,

2715
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:09,653
like you said,
a wild animal that only cares about 

2716
02:05:11,431 --> 02:05:14,850
staying alive essentially and for the 
bull breeding.

2717
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:16,043
But that is a,
that was an experience I got so close 

2718
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:20,640
that I was like,
okay,

2719
02:05:20,641 --> 02:05:22,920
if he,
he's going to know I'm here eventually,

2720
02:05:22,921 --> 02:05:24,480
what am I going?
How close am I going to get?

2721
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:26,320
What's he going to do?
Because they're,

2722
02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:27,960
they're aggressive.
This time of year,

2723
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:30,990
testosterone is skyrocketed because our 
breeding and they're fighting.

2724
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:31,824
They're doing all of this thing.
What's he gonna do when he sees me this 

2725
02:05:33,631 --> 02:05:35,640
close?
So I didn't really know for sure,

2726
02:05:35,641 --> 02:05:40,050
but I felt that wind shift a little bit 
at and I felt it on the back of my neck.

2727
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:41,573
So I came to full draw.
He's 10 feet away and he stands up and 

2728
02:05:44,941 --> 02:05:49,080
he's like,
he knew right then I'm standing plain as

2729
02:05:49,081 --> 02:05:49,914
day.
Once he stood up and we've got an image 

2730
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:52,254
I'll post up here in a second of me at 
full draw 10 feet on this big bull 

2731
02:05:56,080 --> 02:05:56,913
elephant.
Credible.

2732
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:59,370
But the footage is amazing.
That's going to be cool to show.

2733
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:03,590
Now the footage is going to be amazing.
And we also got footage of a bullet.

2734
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:05,770
Um,
we couldn't shoot because even though he

2735
02:06:05,771 --> 02:06:06,604
was a huge bowl,
he was a younger bull who was probably 

2736
02:06:08,501 --> 02:06:13,330
five or six years old and it was in the 
snow and it was 40 yards away,

2737
02:06:13,331 --> 02:06:15,550
broadside,
screaming his lungs out.

2738
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:17,590
We're just standing there going,
wow,

2739
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:18,513
this is crazy.
He's just standing on top of the 

2740
02:06:19,811 --> 02:06:21,930
mountain going,
where's my batch?

2741
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:22,903
Has to.
Most people like when you're on public 

2742
02:06:28,731 --> 02:06:29,564
land,
like when I used to hunt the Eagle cap 

2743
02:06:31,431 --> 02:06:32,264
wilderness,
that bull's dead or I'm going to try to 

2744
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:38,234
kill that bowl or you gotten.
There's all sorts of things that can 

2745
02:06:39,831 --> 02:06:40,401
happen,
you know,

2746
02:06:40,401 --> 02:06:42,150
when you're shooting an arrow.
But uh,

2747
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:43,483
the reason why where we were hunting and
so good is because it's so well managed 

2748
02:06:46,630 --> 02:06:49,280
because normally,
so it's five or six years old,

2749
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:52,700
that's a hell of a trophy for anybody on
public land.

2750
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:55,250
But when everybody can come together and
say,

2751
02:06:55,251 --> 02:06:56,900
okay guys,
here's what we're going to do,

2752
02:06:56,901 --> 02:07:00,080
we're only going to kill the eight to 10
year old bulls.

2753
02:07:00,440 --> 02:07:03,050
You let those bulls grow and then you 
get an amazing.

2754
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:06,710
That's,
that's one reason why Arizona so good.

2755
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:07,660
Um,
they,

2756
02:07:07,660 --> 02:07:08,493
they do,
they manage it for trophy animals and 

2757
02:07:11,211 --> 02:07:12,740
uh,
some places in New Mexico,

2758
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:14,770
Mexico is good.
Um,

2759
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:15,703
there's a place in Oregon is the 
[inaudible] or I put in for and it's 

2760
02:07:19,851 --> 02:07:20,684
public land,
but it's a really hard tagged drop and 

2761
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:24,440
putting in for,
for 17 years now,

2762
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:27,830
but they only give they,
they were getting 10,

2763
02:07:27,831 --> 02:07:28,664
I think now they give 20 tags a year and
there's big bulls there and it's just 

2764
02:07:32,421 --> 02:07:33,254
because it's managed.
So there's a few different places that 

2765
02:07:34,641 --> 02:07:35,474
are managed older animals,
but if you're just going straight up 

2766
02:07:37,331 --> 02:07:38,164
public land,
it's really hard to pass up a five or 

2767
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:41,120
six year old boy.

2768
02:07:41,120 --> 02:07:43,760
Now how do they make that decision to 
only give 20 tax?

2769
02:07:43,761 --> 02:07:46,160
Because it's probably,
I would imagine thousands of people that

2770
02:07:46,161 --> 02:07:47,320
are trying to draw.
Yeah,

2771
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:50,160
these tags and only 20 people get an 
opportunity to.

2772
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:51,013
How do they make that distinction just 
by the biologists pick the number of 

2773
02:07:54,051 --> 02:07:54,930
animals.
Yeah.

2774
02:07:55,850 --> 02:07:56,683
They just do some sort of a survey and 
find out how many of their animals and 

2775
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:00,573
also some places managed for better 
genetics and higher potential of what 

2776
02:08:03,981 --> 02:08:05,020
they would call.
You know,

2777
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:07,880
there's a real problem with that word 
trophy because people think,

2778
02:08:07,881 --> 02:08:09,710
oh,
you just want to decorate your wall.

2779
02:08:09,711 --> 02:08:11,050
That animal's body.
No.

2780
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:14,720
You trophy hunter or do you eat?
I'm like both.

2781
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:15,733
Yeah.
Well the truth is an intense experience 

2782
02:08:19,461 --> 02:08:22,570
with a mature animal that has a lot of 
x,

2783
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:26,050
a lot of lifetime of surviving.
You know,

2784
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:29,910
like it's a way different animal.
Like if when you're around a young bold,

2785
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:31,490
they don't know anything.
They're like babies.

2786
02:08:31,590 --> 02:08:35,100
Well they know spike,
they barely know what's going on.

2787
02:08:35,101 --> 02:08:37,530
Like what are you a spikes been alive 
for a year and a half.

2788
02:08:37,590 --> 02:08:40,440
Right?
So that's where the herd protects them.

2789
02:08:40,730 --> 02:08:43,200
Elk are herd animals,
they look out for each other.

2790
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:44,213
So when you have an eight to 10 year old
bull that has a protection of the herd 

2791
02:08:49,830 --> 02:08:50,663
but also has,
has been around for eight to 10 hunting 

2792
02:08:53,701 --> 02:08:55,530
seasons.
That's a smart animal.

2793
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:56,393
He seen some shit.
He's seen some stuff and it's a smart 

2794
02:08:58,201 --> 02:08:59,034
animal.
So,

2795
02:08:59,190 --> 02:09:00,023
um,
there was a guy in camp also that has 

2796
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,750
hunted the San Carlos,
um,

2797
02:09:04,830 --> 02:09:08,760
Indian reservation and he talked about 
this big bolt there.

2798
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:12,090
That new is being hunted,
circled around them,

2799
02:09:12,150 --> 02:09:17,150
came in from the backside of the hunters
to look at him because he was that,

2800
02:09:17,161 --> 02:09:17,994
that bull had been around and knew what 
was going on so much and so they were 

2801
02:09:21,571 --> 02:09:25,350
able to track them and see what he did 
and he went around behind the hunters.

2802
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:29,880
And so these animals would imagine,
I mean,

2803
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:33,450
this is where they live every day for 
eight to 10 years.

2804
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:35,190
You,
you see some stuff,

2805
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:39,240
you learn where humans as hunters like 
to go.

2806
02:09:39,630 --> 02:09:44,190
So we're probably a minor threat in 
comparison to the mountain lions.

2807
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:44,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

2808
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:47,370
We're talking about how many cats are on
this ranch,

2809
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:48,440
right?
There's,

2810
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:51,600
there's,
but they know humans are danger.

2811
02:09:51,990 --> 02:09:53,850
I mean they know that.
And then like I said,

2812
02:09:54,030 --> 02:09:55,500
they know.
So,

2813
02:09:56,010 --> 02:09:58,620
so there are certain places where 
hunters,

2814
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:01,200
regardless of who's there,
go to glass,

2815
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:03,900
go to call.
And those elk know that,

2816
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:06,390
okay,
I see something there.

2817
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:07,493
That's where I've seen a human.
Whatever they think a human is before 

2818
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,740
I'm not going there,
you know.

2819
02:10:13,741 --> 02:10:16,980
So it's um,
once you get an age on an animal,

2820
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:17,963
it gets tough.
It gets tough to get him killed and I 

2821
02:10:20,201 --> 02:10:21,034
would imagine

2822
02:10:21,650 --> 02:10:23,630
mountain lion population as high as it 
is,

2823
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:24,523
like they have to be on point 24 slash 
seven with something that's faster than 

2824
02:10:28,011 --> 02:10:31,070
them killed.
Kills them with its teeth.

2825
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:33,140
Yeah.
Something that can leap up and literally

2826
02:10:33,470 --> 02:10:34,220
a hold of its neck.

2827
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:37,640
Remember we were talking to Johnny in 
Colorado and he was telling us about the

2828
02:10:37,641 --> 02:10:41,240
footprints that he found.
They found a bunch of cat footprints and

2829
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:42,074
then they found a bunch of elk 
footprints and then they only found the 

2830
02:10:44,631 --> 02:10:45,464
elk footprints and then a couple hundred
yards later they found a dead bowl with 

2831
02:10:49,191 --> 02:10:51,860
a giant mountain lion clinging to its 
neck.

2832
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:53,173
Like that's,
that's a hard life when a fucking 150 

2833
02:10:56,121 --> 02:10:58,790
pound cat and bring down a thousand 
pound bull.

2834
02:10:58,910 --> 02:10:59,690
Yeah.
So the.

2835
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:01,680
So the line was on the Bulls back,
so,

2836
02:11:01,820 --> 02:11:03,430
so that's why it's,
it's uh,

2837
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:04,733
it,
some prince were gone and the snow 

2838
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:09,050
because he was up on the bull trying to 
get it killed.

2839
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:11,060
The bull was taken off for a couple 
hundred yards.

2840
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:14,750
Finally the cat club down on probably 
it's wind pipe.

2841
02:11:15,080 --> 02:11:19,100
Got Killed and that's happening outside 
of season.

2842
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:21,280
That's tiny.
That's happening every day,

2843
02:11:21,281 --> 02:11:22,010
every day.

2844
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:23,840
That's not,
that's not hunting season.

2845
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:26,690
That's just real life out there.
So airs.

2846
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:28,240
Yeah.
Um,

2847
02:11:28,940 --> 02:11:29,600
yeah.
So it's.

2848
02:11:29,600 --> 02:11:33,830
But we kind of started to talk about the
trophy hunting aspect of what people,

2849
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:36,120
you know,
when they have that,

2850
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:36,973
that trophy hunting moniker that is,
it has negative connotation and that's 

2851
02:11:40,791 --> 02:11:41,624
what we talked about this a little bit 
last night on the way back from the 

2852
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:47,450
airport,
the grizzly hunting in British Columbia,

2853
02:11:47,480 --> 02:11:51,590
you know,
that they're stopping that November,

2854
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:55,880
there'll be no more grizzly hunting.
They were killing 250 barrels a year out

2855
02:11:55,881 --> 02:11:56,714
of 15,000.
So they're basically just managing the 

2856
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:00,050
population,
you know,

2857
02:12:00,051 --> 02:12:00,884
you have to take a certain amount of 
animals out given the habitat and the 

2858
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:04,364
carrying capacity of the land,
especially predators because they don't 

2859
02:12:06,621 --> 02:12:07,880
have predators.
Right,

2860
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:08,743
right.
Because what else is going to kill a 

2861
02:12:09,441 --> 02:12:10,274
Grizzly,
right?

2862
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:11,360
Nothing,
nothing.

2863
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:12,620
So people say,
well,

2864
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:13,550
the,
you know,

2865
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:14,384
they'll,
their numbers will drop down on their 

2866
02:12:15,681 --> 02:12:16,514
own if they're,
if they eat all the deer and all the 

2867
02:12:19,011 --> 02:12:19,850
moves,
you're right,

2868
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,730
their numbers will drop down,
but it will take decades.

2869
02:12:22,730 --> 02:12:24,470
Yeah,
and if you're in that time,

2870
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:27,080
you're going to destroy two different 
things,

2871
02:12:27,081 --> 02:12:29,420
right?
You're going to destroy the ungulates,

2872
02:12:29,650 --> 02:12:33,740
they're going to get devastated and 
you're going to also destroy the economy

2873
02:12:33,741 --> 02:12:34,574
that comes with hunting.
[inaudible] like the economy that comes 

2874
02:12:36,801 --> 02:12:38,720
with hunting,
those ungulates because they're going to

2875
02:12:38,721 --> 02:12:39,554
get devastated by the overwhelming 
population of grizzly bears in the 

2876
02:12:42,411 --> 02:12:44,690
economy that comes with hunting.
The grizzly bears,

2877
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:45,733
which in managing them,
what they're going to have to probably 

2878
02:12:47,901 --> 02:12:48,734
do is what they've done with mountain 
lions in California where people don't 

2879
02:12:51,351 --> 02:12:53,690
know because mountain lion hunting is 
outlawed in California.

2880
02:12:53,691 --> 02:12:57,440
So what they do is they hire hunters to 
kill mountain lions and they've killed,

2881
02:12:57,770 --> 02:13:00,290
I believe they killed almost a hundred 
last year.

2882
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:02,810
I think it was like 97.
Most of them,

2883
02:13:02,811 --> 02:13:07,130
they find pets in their body.
They find like their primary food source

2884
02:13:07,131 --> 02:13:09,060
more than 50 percent of dogs.
Right?

2885
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:12,980
And they just killing people's dogs.
So the lions are still getting killed.

2886
02:13:13,030 --> 02:13:13,863
Yeah,
but there's just not a hunter is doing 

2887
02:13:14,511 --> 02:13:16,910
it.
It's government basically shoot,

2888
02:13:17,590 --> 02:13:18,423
they can run dogs with them,
they can do all sorts of things to get 

2889
02:13:20,071 --> 02:13:22,670
them killed.
But it's a government paying somebody to

2890
02:13:22,671 --> 02:13:23,504
do it as opposed to hunter's pain for 
the opportunity to do it to kill the 

2891
02:13:27,051 --> 02:13:29,660
same amount.
So instead of money going to the state,

2892
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:32,130
the state's paying money and it's a lot

2893
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:32,963
of money,
especially when you're talking about 

2894
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:35,730
something like grizzly bears,
grizzly bear,

2895
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:37,430
what they're saying up there.
And I,

2896
02:13:37,470 --> 02:13:38,250
I,
you know,

2897
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,083
did some research on it just because I 
want to know how this works because why 

2898
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:44,970
it got was being stopped.
It's just public outcry.

2899
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,560
And the new government in British 
Columbia said,

2900
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:50,490
I'm in this day and age,
you know,

2901
02:13:50,491 --> 02:13:53,850
the public just can't stomach grizzly 
trophy hunting.

2902
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:56,630
So the public,
what the hell does the public know?

2903
02:13:56,631 --> 02:13:57,464
The public doesn't even.
They're not even out there where they 

2904
02:13:59,461 --> 02:14:00,294
have a misconception and their their 
ideas all based on them being in the 

2905
02:14:04,321 --> 02:14:09,321
cities and the major population center 
of British Columbia in Vancouver.

2906
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:12,380
It's a big urban liberal.
Yeah,

2907
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,220
probably a lot of different people.
Their camera.

2908
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:16,320
You don't have to be generalizing to 
find.

2909
02:14:16,321 --> 02:14:18,660
Probably they could have voted for 
Obama.

2910
02:14:18,661 --> 02:14:23,370
They would've.
So these people that live in Vancouver,

2911
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:24,233
they come comprise the majority of the 
people that are voting in British 

2912
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:29,873
Columbia,
and so they voted out the grizzly bear 

2913
02:14:30,691 --> 02:14:31,524
hunting,
but these people like that I know like 

2914
02:14:33,181 --> 02:14:35,370
my friend Mike Hawk Ridge who lives in 
BC.

2915
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:36,253
Yeah.
Mike's had a lot of experience with 

2916
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:41,880
grizzly bears and wolves.
Wolves up there are so plentiful.

2917
02:14:41,881 --> 02:14:45,480
They don't have a bag limit on them.
You can shoot as many wolves as you want

2918
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:46,333
to encourage you to shoot wolves.
There's even a bounty in some places on 

2919
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:50,380
wolves.
Well,

2920
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:51,233
and do you know,
so I think this was a little different 

2921
02:14:54,031 --> 02:14:57,810
up there with the bears.
I don't think they voted it out per se.

2922
02:14:58,140 --> 02:14:58,973
I think the new government came in.
They took a poll and said who supports 

2923
02:15:04,531 --> 02:15:08,370
grizzly hunting and whatever 71 or 74 
percent said they were opposed,

2924
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:11,490
so the new government just said,
okay,

2925
02:15:12,090 --> 02:15:13,740
we're going to make the decision to stop
it.

2926
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,090
Well,
they didn't stop it.

2927
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:18,210
This is what they did.
You can hunt the grizzlies for meat,

2928
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:22,590
but you can't keep the rug or the skull 
or the skull,

2929
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:23,520
the hider,
the skull,

2930
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:25,170
which people consider trophies.

2931
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:26,053
Right.
But what the problem with that is that 

2932
02:15:27,301 --> 02:15:29,310
is also a resource.
You're,

2933
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:30,153
you're eliminating a resource.
If you shoot a bear and you eat the 

2934
02:15:32,881 --> 02:15:35,220
bear,
why wouldn't you keep the rug,

2935
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:38,760
like have a bear rug in your house to 
commemorate that experience.

2936
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:41,070
And also it's,
you know,

2937
02:15:41,071 --> 02:15:44,640
people have bare skin rugs.
It's always been.

2938
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:47,990
I had about 50 of them,
but it's,

2939
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:49,900
it's something that people,
you know,

2940
02:15:49,901 --> 02:15:53,400
like if you're eating the animal that is
also a part of the animal,

2941
02:15:53,401 --> 02:15:55,860
why would you be compelled to throw that
away?

2942
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:58,140
That seems incredibly wasteful.
No,

2943
02:15:58,141 --> 02:15:59,430
it's disrespectful,
right?

2944
02:15:59,431 --> 02:16:03,420
It's also disrespectful to just shoot an
animal just for its skin.

2945
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,000
If you're a type of person was to shoot 
an elephant,

2946
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:08,520
just take the tusks and let them meet 
Rod.

2947
02:16:08,550 --> 02:16:10,290
A lot of people think that's 
disrespectful.

2948
02:16:10,440 --> 02:16:13,580
That's where trophy hunting gets its bad
monica.

2949
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:16,890
So what they've done is the opposite of 
what makes sense.

2950
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:17,843
You've or you've removed part of the 
value of that animal and you've also 

2951
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:25,140
removed most of the economy of people 
hunting that animal.

2952
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:26,400
So most people are not going to hunt 
them.

2953
02:16:26,430 --> 02:16:30,310
What they said was,
so they were killing 250 a year and

2954
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:35,340
they could get like out of country or or
whoever,

2955
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:40,090
whatever hunters to pay $25,000
to hunt those bare.

2956
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:43,320
So it was 25,000
times 250.

2957
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:46,270
It's like a lot.
I don't know,

2958
02:16:46,271 --> 02:16:48,160
it's like stupid.
Over a thousand dollars

2959
02:16:48,170 --> 02:16:49,190
it seems.
They're both stupid.

2960
02:16:49,850 --> 02:16:51,440
But anyway,
so that money,

2961
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:54,050
just like the lines of dollars,
just like the lion hunting.

2962
02:16:54,170 --> 02:16:56,450
Oh God,
I should be able to figure that out.

2963
02:16:56,451 --> 02:16:59,690
I don't want it to Jamie a hundred.
How many tags they give?

2964
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:03,670
Two hundred and 50.
Two hundred 50 times 20 slash 25,000.

2965
02:17:03,950 --> 02:17:06,600
What does that smart people say?
Figured it out.

2966
02:17:06,601 --> 02:17:07,910
I'm going to get take.
Yes,

2967
02:17:09,930 --> 02:17:12,420
I don't know.
Fifty dollars million.

2968
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:14,970
You'd have to have a pen and paper,
say $50 million,

2969
02:17:15,800 --> 02:17:17,580
6 million,
250,

2970
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:19,560
6 million,
250,

2971
02:17:19,561 --> 02:17:22,200
whatever dollars always wrong,
so think of that.

2972
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:23,463
Now think that's the money that's gone.
That money is now no longer going into 

2973
02:17:26,611 --> 02:17:29,310
the economy.
Now they're going to have what they call

2974
02:17:29,340 --> 02:17:30,173
problem bears.
Now problem bears are bears that attack 

2975
02:17:31,921 --> 02:17:34,530
people,
which is very frequent bears that attack

2976
02:17:34,531 --> 02:17:35,940
animals,
livestock,

2977
02:17:35,941 --> 02:17:36,774
bears that encroach upon people's 
established residences and communities 

2978
02:17:41,311 --> 02:17:42,144
and start eating garbage cans and 
killing pets and things along those 

2979
02:17:44,641 --> 02:17:45,474
lines.
Then they have to hire people to go out 

2980
02:17:46,981 --> 02:17:47,814
and kill these bears,
and that's going to cost thousands of 

2981
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:51,323
dollars a day.
You're going to have to pay for 

2982
02:17:52,141 --> 02:17:52,974
equipment dogs.
They usually have to track them with 

2983
02:17:54,781 --> 02:17:57,410
dogs.
These dogs have to be trained.

2984
02:17:57,430 --> 02:17:58,263
You have to get specialists.
Who knows you're doing tends to be more 

2985
02:18:00,361 --> 02:18:03,270
than one because they need backup 
because you didn't know a thousand pound

2986
02:18:03,271 --> 02:18:03,780
animal.

2987
02:18:03,780 --> 02:18:05,430
I don't know if you want dogs on a 
grizzly.

2988
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,340
I think that's how they find them.
I don't know.

2989
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:10,260
I think that's black bear.
No.

2990
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:11,123
One of the guys that was on a Grizzly,
a greedy Bowman podcast was totally 

2991
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:17,580
about it.
Dogs at the grizzly.

2992
02:18:17,581 --> 02:18:18,840
Yeah.
That they use dogs.

2993
02:18:19,350 --> 02:18:21,030
Dogs wouldn't last long.
Well,

2994
02:18:21,031 --> 02:18:24,630
I don't think they engage the grizzly.
I think they find them,

2995
02:18:24,730 --> 02:18:28,470
you know,
and bark at him and obey him up and then

2996
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:29,121
you know,
they,

2997
02:18:29,121 --> 02:18:32,040
they locate them and then that's when 
the hunter comes in.

2998
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:32,903
Okay.
But that's the other thing that people 

2999
02:18:34,771 --> 02:18:38,520
don't like.
That idea of using dogs to hunt animals,

3000
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,180
but that's one of the more effective 
ways to find these animals.

3001
02:18:42,181 --> 02:18:46,590
It's one of the best ways they use in a 
lot of states to find mountain lions and

3002
02:18:46,591 --> 02:18:48,570
people think it's fucked up and cruel.

3003
02:18:48,620 --> 02:18:51,080
The only effective way to hunt mountain 
lions to be,

3004
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:52,370
to be honest.
I mean,

3005
02:18:52,371 --> 02:18:54,470
you can gamble,
you might see one,

3006
02:18:54,471 --> 02:18:56,930
have a tag.
I mean I buy a tag in Oregon every year.

3007
02:18:57,320 --> 02:19:00,340
I've seen about.
I said,

3008
02:19:00,510 --> 02:19:03,680
I think I've seen three mountain lions 
in 30 years.

3009
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:04,813
I have a tag.
I mean I've had a shot one time didn't 

3010
02:19:07,431 --> 02:19:08,264
get killed,
but if you have dogs then you can say 

3011
02:19:11,271 --> 02:19:12,140
okay,
we have,

3012
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,870
we have 10,000
mountain lions,

3013
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:17,030
um,
we need to take out,

3014
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:18,740
you know,
$500 a year.

3015
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:19,933
So like a lot of states have once 
because once you kill a lion then you 

3016
02:19:24,201 --> 02:19:26,990
have to go to game and fish and get it 
checked in.

3017
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,950
They do measurements to do all this,
all these different things.

3018
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:35,120
And so once 500 lines of come in,
the season stops,

3019
02:19:35,660 --> 02:19:37,110
right?
So they have a,

3020
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:40,720
a mortality threshold.
You have to have that.

3021
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,320
Once they reached that limit,
they said,

3022
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:44,930
well we have 10,000,
we need to kill 500 a year.

3023
02:19:44,931 --> 02:19:45,764
So once we kill 500 season's over.
And why would you want to kill them 

3024
02:19:48,270 --> 02:19:49,580
online?
I don't understand.

3025
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:50,320
Well,
first of all,

3026
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,120
you,
you,

3027
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:51,953
you to control again the population of 
predators because nothing else does and 

3028
02:19:55,671 --> 02:19:57,350
to,
you can eat mountain lions and there are

3029
02:19:57,351 --> 02:19:58,880
apparently delicious.
Yeah.

3030
02:19:59,210 --> 02:20:00,610
You had it.
No,

3031
02:20:00,611 --> 02:20:01,940
I never have.
No.

3032
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:05,180
I know people that have written,
Allah says it's absolutely delicious.

3033
02:20:05,181 --> 02:20:07,220
He shot them out in line last year for 
the first time.

3034
02:20:07,221 --> 02:20:09,870
He's had it before,
but he's never had his own instead.

3035
02:20:09,950 --> 02:20:11,870
It was sensational.
Now I definitely eat it.

3036
02:20:11,870 --> 02:20:12,703
I want.
I'd like to hunt lion and never have 

3037
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:17,210
before and you know,
using the dogs.

3038
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,870
The dogs are a tool.
They're a tool,

3039
02:20:20,900 --> 02:20:22,820
like a bow,
like a rifle.

3040
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
It's just those dogs have been trained 
so well and love what they do.

3041
02:20:28,850 --> 02:20:31,970
The owners love the dogs and that's 
just.

3042
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:34,250
I mean there's,
I don't know,

3043
02:20:34,251 --> 02:20:39,251
it's such a special bond between them 
and then just being part of that is just

3044
02:20:40,910 --> 02:20:44,720
another amazing hunting experience.
It's just a different tool to use.

3045
02:20:45,050 --> 02:20:45,883
Yeah,
well I think people think of dogs as 

3046
02:20:47,241 --> 02:20:52,010
being only pets and that's what they 
should be used as in dog shouldn't work,

3047
02:20:52,011 --> 02:20:53,970
but you know,
that is an.

3048
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:56,260
I understand that because I have pets 
and no,

3049
02:20:56,450 --> 02:20:59,180
I wouldn't want Marshall to go out and 
get attack.

3050
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:01,490
Barsha would shit his pants if even saw 
a bear,

3051
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:02,803
but this.
There's different kinds of dogs that 

3052
02:21:05,841 --> 02:21:07,850
were bred for a very specific purpose.

3053
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:10,400
That's what those dogs want to do.
They do it.

3054
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:11,234
That's one of the things that Aaron 
Schneider talked about in the podcast 

3055
02:21:13,071 --> 02:21:13,904
where he was standing in the wrong place
when they opened up the pen to let the 

3056
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:22,010
grizzly dogs out and the dog just leaped
and slammed him in the chest.

3057
02:21:22,011 --> 02:21:23,750
And it just about really,
I'm unconscious.

3058
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:27,650
Which podcast is this?
It's one of the Gritty Bowman podcasts.

3059
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:30,290
The more recent ones.
Let me see if I could pull up the number

3060
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:32,390
because I was listening to it recently.
Oh,

3061
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:35,510
greedy bowman is a very good podcast,
uh,

3062
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:36,403
by these guys that have Ryan as far as 
Brian call and Aaron Snyder and I'm the 

3063
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:46,060
number episode two 81 to 82.
And um,

3064
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:51,770
and there was another one in there,
but to 82 is the,

3065
02:21:52,010 --> 02:21:52,843
I think the big one.
It's about Predator management with a 

3066
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:57,080
bark.
Bart Lancaster,

3067
02:21:57,081 --> 02:21:58,700
and that's the one where they really 
talked about.

3068
02:21:58,910 --> 02:21:59,743
They talked about guys who lived there 
in British Columbia who were talking 

3069
02:22:02,361 --> 02:22:06,080
about how when he's not home and he has 
to go somewhere,

3070
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:09,830
he has to leave his dog with his wife.
If his wife goes riding a horse,

3071
02:22:09,831 --> 02:22:10,664
he has to bring.
The wife has to bring dogs with her 

3072
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:15,240
because there's so many fucking grizzly 
bears out there.

3073
02:22:15,530 --> 02:22:17,900
They have to have something that's going
to protect him,

3074
02:22:17,901 --> 02:22:21,620
warn him,
and these dogs are not just pets.

3075
02:22:21,621 --> 02:22:25,470
They're also a first line of defense.
The let them know that there's danger in

3076
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:26,304
the area,
let them know that bears near and also 

3077
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,520
keep the bears away because the bears 
here,

3078
02:22:29,521 --> 02:22:30,354
dogs,
they don't want to fuck around and the 

3079
02:22:31,531 --> 02:22:34,680
dogs start barking.
That means people are going to know that

3080
02:22:34,681 --> 02:22:35,970
means outcome the guns.
Right?

3081
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:36,930
Right.
Yeah,

3082
02:22:36,930 --> 02:22:38,550
yeah.
Good deterrent for sure.

3083
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:40,890
People in Vancouver didn't understand 
this.

3084
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:41,723
They're not there.
They just sitting there eating Tofu and 

3085
02:22:44,281 --> 02:22:44,991
you know,
and,

3086
02:22:44,991 --> 02:22:45,824
and,
and talking about spirituality and you 

3087
02:22:47,731 --> 02:22:49,230
know,
and then they,

3088
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:54,060
they pass these bands and they upset the
entire balance of nature.

3089
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:58,800
They upset the economy,
the economy of hunting of conservation.

3090
02:22:58,801 --> 02:23:01,640
All these things get good all lopsided 
and it's.

3091
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:04,620
I understand where they're coming from.
I understand the sentiment,

3092
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:05,813
but it's a lot of it is entirely based 
on the images that people have seen in 

3093
02:23:10,411 --> 02:23:14,700
movies and Disney films and the 
anthropomorphization of these animals.

3094
02:23:14,701 --> 02:23:18,690
Will you attach human characteristics to
these ultra predators,

3095
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:22,440
these enormous monsters of nature,
which are amazing.

3096
02:23:22,441 --> 02:23:24,210
We don't like.
I can speak for myself,

3097
02:23:24,211 --> 02:23:27,330
but I know I'm speaking for you too.
We don't want bears to not be there.

3098
02:23:27,331 --> 02:23:29,970
We don't want wolves to not be there.
They're amazing.

3099
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:33,390
I'm glad that they exist.
They're fucking awesome.

3100
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:36,480
I mean to be outside.
I've never heard a wolf howl.

3101
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:39,660
Well I did once.
I did it with Hawk Ridge in BC,

3102
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:42,270
but they were like way in the distance,
heard wolves howl,

3103
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:47,100
but to see them and be there when it's 
happening and I saw a grizzly bear wants

3104
02:23:47,101 --> 02:23:49,440
in in Alberta and just to look at it,
it's like,

3105
02:23:49,441 --> 02:23:51,570
Holy Shit.
You see those things.

3106
02:23:51,571 --> 02:23:52,910
It's amazing.
I mean it's,

3107
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:54,030
it's magical,

3108
02:23:54,570 --> 02:23:59,040
but that doesn't mean that they don't 
need to be managed in that weird word.

3109
02:23:59,041 --> 02:23:59,920
Right.
That's,

3110
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:01,770
and that's what people say is like,
well,

3111
02:24:01,771 --> 02:24:03,610
why are we interfere,
interfering?

3112
02:24:03,640 --> 02:24:04,473
Why can't they had figured out 
themselves they have forever and what 

3113
02:24:06,931 --> 02:24:07,764
people don't fail to realize,
I guess is no man's always been 

3114
02:24:12,091 --> 02:24:13,110
involved.
Yeah,

3115
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:14,840
we've always hunted.
Yeah.

3116
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:15,810
We've,
you know,

3117
02:24:15,811 --> 02:24:18,080
we've been involved in how many animals 
are,

3118
02:24:18,081 --> 02:24:18,914
are sometimes we've been involved 
natively like when we almost wiped out 

3119
02:24:21,601 --> 02:24:22,434
the elk or the Buffalo,
but lately we've been involved 

3120
02:24:26,251 --> 02:24:27,780
positively and we manage them

3121
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:31,310
and this is the other thing they talked 
about on the greedy Bowman podcast where

3122
02:24:31,311 --> 02:24:32,144
they really emphasize the difference 
between a biologist who's not in the 

3123
02:24:35,091 --> 02:24:37,070
field and these,
these,

3124
02:24:37,071 --> 02:24:39,620
all these different people,
whether it's the,

3125
02:24:39,621 --> 02:24:40,454
uh,
uh,

3126
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:41,453
the,
the hunters themselves or whether it's 

3127
02:24:43,881 --> 02:24:44,714
the guides or whether it's the people 
that are outfitters that are there 24 

3128
02:24:48,951 --> 02:24:50,300
slash seven,
three 65.

3129
02:24:50,330 --> 02:24:53,810
They can give you more data.
They understand the real numbers is very

3130
02:24:53,811 --> 02:24:54,644
difficult when you're dealing with,
especially something like British 

3131
02:24:57,170 --> 02:24:58,003
Columbia,
intensely wooded area to get a real 

3132
02:25:00,591 --> 02:25:02,180
number.
I mean,

3133
02:25:02,181 --> 02:25:03,014
there's no map.
There's no like you can't just pull up 

3134
02:25:05,121 --> 02:25:05,954
the social security numbers of the bears
and find out how many of them are still 

3135
02:25:08,091 --> 02:25:08,800
alive and he

3136
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,960
can't.
He can't fly over and get account,

3137
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:15,000
like to do a lot of animals like Caribou
or something who will caribou or it even

3138
02:25:15,010 --> 02:25:17,320
elk where they winter,
so elk,

3139
02:25:17,450 --> 02:25:18,940
you know,
once once winter hits,

3140
02:25:18,941 --> 02:25:21,760
they get pushed down to where they can 
get feed in the winter.

3141
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:24,310
That's where they get to the counts

3142
02:25:24,370 --> 02:25:25,203
right now and so that's where they can 
get a pretty good number or an idea of 

3143
02:25:27,611 --> 02:25:30,520
how many elk are in that area.
Bear don't do you.

3144
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:33,430
You're never going to fly over there.
No wintering grounds for bear.

3145
02:25:33,580 --> 02:25:35,200
Well,
that's another important thing that Adam

3146
02:25:35,201 --> 02:25:36,034
found out.
What Adam Green tree was on this crazy 

3147
02:25:38,681 --> 02:25:40,720
walkabout that he was doing for the last
month.

3148
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:44,350
He found mountain grizzlies would.
He believes and he says,

3149
02:25:44,351 --> 02:25:46,810
and I know that he's a very smart guy.
He's been around a lot of animals.

3150
02:25:47,050 --> 02:25:49,930
He believes is 100 percent mountain 
grizzlies in Colorado.

3151
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:53,110
That's what he said.
He took pictures of them and he even put

3152
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:53,944
up photos.
They're really hard to see pictures way 

3153
02:25:56,141 --> 02:25:58,630
off in the distance,
but even put a photo up of,

3154
02:25:58,690 --> 02:26:00,230
you know,
online.

3155
02:26:00,231 --> 02:26:03,540
He did online searches for that mountain
range in Colorado.

3156
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:06,190
They said that it's like people who see 
big foot,

3157
02:26:06,280 --> 02:26:07,930
they say they see grizzlies,
but he's like,

3158
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:08,380
he's.

3159
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:09,890
He spotted four of them.
Yeah.

3160
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:11,770
Yeah.
So I mean that,

3161
02:26:11,780 --> 02:26:13,270
that's a good example.
I mean,

3162
02:26:13,271 --> 02:26:16,030
if those were grizzly,
then there's grizzly.

3163
02:26:16,031 --> 02:26:16,864
We didn't know about how many people are
going to do with Adam did and actually 

3164
02:26:18,851 --> 02:26:23,170
go out there 20 plus miles deep into the
woods with a fucking tent and find these

3165
02:26:23,171 --> 02:26:24,004
things.
It's incredibly difficult to get real 

3166
02:26:26,021 --> 02:26:28,470
world numbers on these animals.
Yep.

3167
02:26:28,630 --> 02:26:30,190
And that's.
So once you,

3168
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:31,790
once you take,
um,

3169
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:34,430
once you take the science out of it and 
the,

3170
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:37,990
the people with boots on the ground 
actually weighing in on,

3171
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,340
hey,
here's how,

3172
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:42,730
here's how many animals are,
here's how many we need to kill.

3173
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:43,773
Once you do,
like they did NBC and the Government 

3174
02:26:46,061 --> 02:26:49,330
just decides that the public can't 
stomach it anymore because they did.

3175
02:26:49,331 --> 02:26:52,090
Some poll at stars,
they have starbucks in BC,

3176
02:26:52,091 --> 02:26:52,924
right?
Yes.

3177
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:53,933
A pole at starbucks and uh,
which is where I went in today by the 

3178
02:26:56,981 --> 02:26:59,350
way,
but I still kill stuff.

3179
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:01,310
Um,
uh,

3180
02:27:01,630 --> 02:27:04,900
that's when,
that's where we cause problems.

3181
02:27:04,930 --> 02:27:06,460
We create issues.
We,

3182
02:27:06,510 --> 02:27:09,790
you know,
we use the wrong tools to.

3183
02:27:09,850 --> 02:27:13,000
We're still managing the,
the animals but not correctly.

3184
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:14,013
Well,
it's also the decisions are based on 

3185
02:27:15,521 --> 02:27:16,354
emotions without real information based 
on the actual environment that these 

3186
02:27:21,341 --> 02:27:22,580
animals live in.
Like you,

3187
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:23,913
you could never imagine if you lived in 
Vancouver and which some of the best 

3188
02:27:27,191 --> 02:27:28,024
restaurants in the world and drove some 
of the nicest streets and I mean 

3189
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:31,953
Vancouver is an amazing city.
If you live there and you had this idea 

3190
02:27:35,710 --> 02:27:38,500
of what wildlife is,
but you never left Vancouver if you.

3191
02:27:38,501 --> 02:27:39,130
Did you.
Oh,

3192
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:41,020
we visited Chicago.
Beautiful.

3193
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:42,490
Yeah.
Now like you don't know,

3194
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:43,533
like you literally have to be there to 
just kind of get a sense of it and you 

3195
02:27:47,321 --> 02:27:50,470
wouldn't get a sense of it in one trip.
You'd have to be there all the time.

3196
02:27:50,471 --> 02:27:51,304
You'd have to,
you'd have to take multiple excursions 

3197
02:27:53,021 --> 02:27:56,170
into the forest to really understand 
what you're talking about,

3198
02:27:56,171 --> 02:27:57,004
what you're dealing with.
So to make those decisions based on 

3199
02:28:00,161 --> 02:28:02,950
people who are completely ignorant about
that situation.

3200
02:28:03,060 --> 02:28:03,893
Right?
It's like,

3201
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,411
it's crazy.
I mean,

3202
02:28:05,411 --> 02:28:05,750
it's,
it's,

3203
02:28:05,750 --> 02:28:06,780
uh,
it's,

3204
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:08,680
it's a ridiculous way to handle it.
So,

3205
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:09,543
so thankfully here in the United States,
we do have a great system for wildlife 

3206
02:28:14,351 --> 02:28:15,184
management and our government,
except for here in California with the 

3207
02:28:19,001 --> 02:28:22,550
mountain lions trust the professionals,
the biologists,

3208
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:23,960
the people out,
you know,

3209
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:25,990
boots on the ground as I said,
and we,

3210
02:28:26,720 --> 02:28:31,690
we trust those people to allocate tags 
to give us numbers to,

3211
02:28:32,070 --> 02:28:37,070
to help manage the hunt seasons and,
and how many tags are for each area.

3212
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:39,920
So thankfully that's continued to happen
here,

3213
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:42,150
but even here it's,
it gets protested.

3214
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:44,970
It gets the delisting of wolves and area
where they're starting to desert,

3215
02:28:45,060 --> 02:28:47,900
desolate or devastating of grizzlies 
surface.

3216
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:51,210
And that's going to get pushed back to 
and people are going to sue against it.

3217
02:28:51,211 --> 02:28:55,560
But the idea is not to kill all these 
animals.

3218
02:28:55,561 --> 02:29:00,240
The idea is not to to satisfy the 
bloodthirsty urges,

3219
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:01,133
some fat redneck that people have in 
their mind as being the stereotypical 

3220
02:29:07,081 --> 02:29:09,570
hunter that they see as a bad guy in a 
movie.

3221
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,280
Right?
Like in a movie,

3222
02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:12,473
it's always like,
remember the scene of Wolverine where 

3223
02:29:13,771 --> 02:29:14,604
there's are the bad guys that killed the
bear and he goes and fucks those bad 

3224
02:29:17,671 --> 02:29:18,504
guys up,
but you shoot that bear with poison or 

3225
02:29:20,600 --> 02:29:21,890
or something like that.
Drinking.

3226
02:29:22,220 --> 02:29:24,390
It's lighthearted.
It's so stereotypical.

3227
02:29:24,391 --> 02:29:27,720
It's like the idea that every beautiful 
woman has to be stupid.

3228
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:30,090
It's just as offensive.

3229
02:29:30,090 --> 02:29:30,923
Right?
And this is the stereotype that we've 

3230
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:34,403
been fed because it's a,
it's a classic cliche sort of a 

3231
02:29:38,761 --> 02:29:39,960
scenario,
right?

3232
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:41,850
It's easy.
You see it in the movie,

3233
02:29:41,851 --> 02:29:43,170
right?
Jocks are big,

3234
02:29:43,171 --> 02:29:44,400
dumb,
stupid guys.

3235
02:29:44,770 --> 02:29:47,170
A hot girls are bimbos.
You know,

3236
02:29:47,180 --> 02:29:49,350
the nerdy guy with glasses is always 
smart.

3237
02:29:49,410 --> 02:29:51,960
Sometimes those nerdy guys with glasses 
are fucking idiots.

3238
02:29:51,961 --> 02:29:52,730
Yeah.
You know,

3239
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:56,520
it doesn't sometimes a hot girls hot 
girls way smarter than us.

3240
02:29:56,610 --> 02:29:57,443
It's all hunters aren't.
Most Times that's the thing that 

3241
02:30:01,771 --> 02:30:02,604
frustrates the shit out of me.
My experience has been like what we 

3242
02:30:05,341 --> 02:30:08,790
experienced this past weekend.
People like Lee and Tiffany,

3243
02:30:08,791 --> 02:30:12,270
people like you and Ben.
Really good people.

3244
02:30:12,600 --> 02:30:14,430
Really good.
Nice people.

3245
02:30:14,490 --> 02:30:15,241
Yeah.
I mean,

3246
02:30:15,241 --> 02:30:19,710
we know so many people that are involved
in the outdoor world,

3247
02:30:19,740 --> 02:30:21,420
whether the hunting world street,
yeah.

3248
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:22,353
Yeah.
Whether it's John Dudley or remy or 

3249
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:26,700
Steve Rinella.
These are great people.

3250
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:27,563
They're exceptional human beings.
People with exceptional character and 

3251
02:30:30,841 --> 02:30:31,674
exceptional discipline right there.
It's not the fat redneck that wants a 

3252
02:30:35,521 --> 02:30:36,354
poisoning.
Grizzly bear that Wolverine has to beat 

3253
02:30:37,771 --> 02:30:39,270
up in the stupid movie.
Right?

3254
02:30:39,330 --> 02:30:40,290
But that's all you see.

3255
02:30:40,390 --> 02:30:41,090
No,
and I,

3256
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:43,090
I even,
I did a call out on,

3257
02:30:43,091 --> 02:30:43,924
um,
it was like some triple x movie or 

3258
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:49,420
Xander's cage.
Somebody,

3259
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:50,583
I don't know what it was,
but they had the girl on there said 

3260
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:57,430
there's the,
they show these bowhunters getting ready

3261
02:30:57,431 --> 02:30:58,264
to shoot.
Did we talk about this on the last time 

3262
02:30:59,740 --> 02:31:00,573
getting ready to,
or maybe I just put my on my facebook 

3263
02:31:02,290 --> 02:31:05,350
getting ready to shoot a lion with a 
bow.

3264
02:31:06,190 --> 02:31:09,610
She's with a rifle with the rifle scope 
on his head.

3265
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:10,623
She shoots the hunter and she says,
so a vin diesel calls were on the phone 

3266
02:31:15,851 --> 02:31:18,160
about some mission they're going to do 
for the stupid movie,

3267
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:21,010
and he says,
what are you up to?

3268
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:22,860
She's like,
even in the odds.

3269
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:27,360
So she was shooting a hunter and that's 
on a,

3270
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:30,330
on a regular movie.
So corny.

3271
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,690
He talked to people in Africa.
They want lions

3272
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:35,550
dead.
[inaudible] lions killed their friends.

3273
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:36,473
Yeah.
Like I know a woman who lived in South 

3274
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:42,270
Africa who lost a friend to a lion.
Yeah.

3275
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:46,350
And when you talk to her about,
she has that South African accent.

3276
02:31:46,351 --> 02:31:49,720
She's born and raised and you know,
when she talks about lions,

3277
02:31:49,730 --> 02:31:51,960
she goes,
they just never been around lions,

3278
02:31:51,961 --> 02:31:53,250
you know,
see what she goes.

3279
02:31:53,251 --> 02:31:54,600
You don't know what it's like.
There was a,

3280
02:31:54,601 --> 02:31:55,434
there was an article that was written by
a guy from Zimbabwe right after the 

3281
02:31:58,621 --> 02:32:01,920
whole season will cecil the lion thing 
that was in the New York Times that said

3282
02:32:01,921 --> 02:32:04,560
in Zimbabwe,
we do not cry for lions.

3283
02:32:05,060 --> 02:32:05,620
Right?
Yeah.

3284
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:08,610
And this was about people that have had 
to deal with these things.

3285
02:32:08,611 --> 02:32:10,680
It's not saying that we want all mine's 
dead.

3286
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,250
No,
I don't know,

3287
02:32:12,251 --> 02:32:14,490
but you got to hunt them so they're out 
of the ordinary

3288
02:32:14,650 --> 02:32:16,270
but live well,
people don't understand.

3289
02:32:16,300 --> 02:32:21,300
It's the same thing as with the grizzly 
bears when they made lying hunting.

3290
02:32:21,580 --> 02:32:22,413
Such a dangerous proposition for people 
that do it because you're going to get 

3291
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:28,450
ostracized people,
gonna show up at your house and protests

3292
02:32:28,451 --> 02:32:31,990
like they did that dentist guy,
they've had a call lions now.

3293
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:35,530
Now they have to hire a hitman to go in 
there and shoot all these lines and they

3294
02:32:35,531 --> 02:32:38,260
make no money.
So instead of making $50,000

3295
02:32:38,261 --> 02:32:40,300
per line,
which helps the community,

3296
02:32:40,510 --> 02:32:44,770
helps fund their schools and gives them 
money and there's been a lot of articles

3297
02:32:44,771 --> 02:32:48,730
written about the,
the lie of conservation when it comes to

3298
02:32:48,731 --> 02:32:52,390
lying hunting and how little of it 
actually goes to the people,

3299
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:55,510
the community and how much of it 
actually goes to the outfitters.

3300
02:32:55,810 --> 02:32:59,440
But you know how much of it goes to the 
community if you don't have hunters?

3301
02:32:59,920 --> 02:33:01,010
Zero,
right?

3302
02:33:01,030 --> 02:33:01,511
Zero.
You know,

3303
02:33:01,511 --> 02:33:02,344
how much of it goes into community if 
these people protest the people that 

3304
02:33:05,201 --> 02:33:07,810
don't want line,
how much did they put in zero?

3305
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:09,700
Right.
They don't help those people at all.

3306
02:33:09,730 --> 02:33:11,580
Most of them just are,
you know,

3307
02:33:11,620 --> 02:33:12,453
Hashtag activists or Internet people 
that are just posting pictures up on 

3308
02:33:18,491 --> 02:33:22,060
instagram and facebook and getting 
people riled up and starting petitions.

3309
02:33:22,061 --> 02:33:25,090
But how much of you actually doing 
there?

3310
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:26,560
Are they doing anything?
No.

3311
02:33:26,710 --> 02:33:28,650
You gotTa Manage Lions?
Yeah.

3312
02:33:28,750 --> 02:33:29,583
Nobody likes to hear that.
But if you want people to live in the 

3313
02:33:32,261 --> 02:33:33,094
same vicinity as lions,
you have to make sure the lion 

3314
02:33:35,321 --> 02:33:37,270
population doesn't get too crazy.
Right.

3315
02:33:37,660 --> 02:33:39,940
And also they devastate the unused 
population.

3316
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,680
They devastated.
That's one of the reasons why they had a

3317
02:33:41,681 --> 02:33:42,700
column in Zimbabwe.

3318
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:43,623
You know,
there,

3319
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:44,813
there's not,
not like they have a bunch of stores 

3320
02:33:47,021 --> 02:33:49,330
with stock fall me.
So they have cows,

3321
02:33:49,420 --> 02:33:51,790
you know,
that's kind of what they have.

3322
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,200
They have cows and their domestic 
animals that they used for food.

3323
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:59,110
This lions come in and kill a bunch of 
those.

3324
02:33:59,111 --> 02:34:03,610
So I mean to them a $600 a cow,
that's huge.

3325
02:34:03,730 --> 02:34:06,050
You know,
at $600 a cow is,

3326
02:34:06,580 --> 02:34:08,530
could be,
I'm not going to say life or death,

3327
02:34:08,531 --> 02:34:13,000
but if that gets killed by a lion,
drastically impacts their life.

3328
02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:13,893
I think

3329
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,880
a lot of people have ideas about 
wildlife.

3330
02:34:16,881 --> 02:34:17,714
They're shaped by movies and by 
television shows and we have this 

3331
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:27,060
unrealistic depiction and that this is 
not in support or against hunting.

3332
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:29,260
This is just a,
I think,

3333
02:34:29,261 --> 02:34:33,610
the reality of humans and our war,
our view of the wild world.

3334
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:36,400
Did you,
you saw that woman last year in,

3335
02:34:36,401 --> 02:34:37,370
um,
she was a,

3336
02:34:37,371 --> 02:34:38,204
uh,
an editor for game of thrones and she 

3337
02:34:41,291 --> 02:34:44,350
was in the wild in Africa.
Oh yeah.

3338
02:34:44,351 --> 02:34:47,050
You got drug out,
decided to roll down her window to get a

3339
02:34:47,060 --> 02:34:49,090
better photo.
And the cat said,

3340
02:34:49,091 --> 02:34:50,710
thank you.
He just reached in,

3341
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:52,690
grabbed her,
pulled her out of the car and killed her

3342
02:34:52,691 --> 02:34:54,280
in front of everybody.
He drug her out.

3343
02:34:54,340 --> 02:34:56,880
That's what a lion does.
Yeah.

3344
02:34:57,120 --> 02:34:59,770
Now it's a,
the lions not doing that because she was

3345
02:34:59,771 --> 02:35:03,640
antagonizing or because it was hungry 
because it's a killing machine.

3346
02:35:03,641 --> 02:35:06,490
It's nature's killing machine is the 
reason why we're not,

3347
02:35:06,750 --> 02:35:09,100
that you don't have to hack your way 
through a river of gazelles.

3348
02:35:09,101 --> 02:35:11,590
Get your fucking car is because those 
cats,

3349
02:35:11,650 --> 02:35:12,790
those cats exist.

3350
02:35:13,130 --> 02:35:14,260
Well,
it's um,

3351
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:15,181
I don't know.
I'm,

3352
02:35:15,181 --> 02:35:16,014
I'm glad.
I'm glad for this forum to talk about 

3353
02:35:19,251 --> 02:35:20,084
things like this because I know we've 
made an impact and because of you and 

3354
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:24,943
you reach so many people and you're 
wearing an under armour shirt right now 

3355
02:35:27,921 --> 02:35:32,570
with a big bowl on it and a and a white 
bow hunting hat and it's just like,

3356
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:34,153
I feel like there's been education 
happening for a few years now and we're 

3357
02:35:38,450 --> 02:35:39,283
slowly turning the tide and people do 
care more about where their food comes 

3358
02:35:43,191 --> 02:35:44,024
from.
Kind of the process of how my had this 

3359
02:35:45,591 --> 02:35:47,480
food get to my.
Not everybody's thinking that,

3360
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:50,020
but a lot of people are.
And uh,

3361
02:35:50,480 --> 02:35:55,480
it just feels like also like bowhunting 
is just a cool thing to be involved.

3362
02:35:56,121 --> 02:35:57,050
Shooting a bow is

3363
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:59,040
cool.
Bose awesome.

3364
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:00,200
It's fun,
it's exciting.

3365
02:36:00,201 --> 02:36:01,034
And I always tell people,
even if you want to eat plants for the 

3366
02:36:02,311 --> 02:36:04,170
rest of your life,
you never want to kill an animal,

3367
02:36:04,171 --> 02:36:06,870
ever just try archery just for 
meditation.

3368
02:36:06,871 --> 02:36:07,704
It's an amazing relaxing thing because 
to release a perfect girl and have it 

3369
02:36:11,401 --> 02:36:12,234
hit that bull's eyes so difficult and 
involves so many different things that 

3370
02:36:15,091 --> 02:36:19,260
you have to manage and control that 
inducing that it's sort of cleanses your

3371
02:36:19,261 --> 02:36:20,100
mind.
Yeah,

3372
02:36:20,220 --> 02:36:21,060
I love it.

3373
02:36:21,130 --> 02:36:22,540
Oh,
nothing better.

3374
02:36:22,541 --> 02:36:25,630
I mean we were,
I post a video yesterday and we were,

3375
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:28,130
you know,
we had success on her act

3376
02:36:28,140 --> 02:36:30,070
out.
We have got elk,

3377
02:36:30,370 --> 02:36:31,203
so our hunt was done and we were still.
Umi and jed were having a great time 

3378
02:36:34,751 --> 02:36:35,584
just shooting arrows and having fun.
Shooting at targets and just laughing 

3379
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:42,400
and making little bets with each other 
and stuff and having a great time.

3380
02:36:42,820 --> 02:36:44,780
Do you owe me now you know,
we're,

3381
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:47,230
we're even where he shadowed me 100 
bucks,

3382
02:36:47,231 --> 02:36:49,750
but I let it slide because under armour 
paid for the hunt.

3383
02:36:50,930 --> 02:36:51,763
But it's just,
I think what's important about podcasts 

3384
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:57,693
and it's not just for hunting.
I think it's important for almost every 

3385
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:02,643
really difficult complex and nuanced 
subject is you have to discuss all the 

3386
02:37:08,021 --> 02:37:11,620
aspects of it and you can't do that on a
regular television show.

3387
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,753
You can't.
Then you also have to remove a lot of 

3388
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:16,933
unrealistic programming that we have in 
our head because of anthropomorphism 

3389
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:22,363
anthropomorphization of animals,
attaching human characteristics that 

3390
02:37:25,371 --> 02:37:28,490
we've seen in Disney movies and all of 
our lives.

3391
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:29,323
Animals had been.
Our friends have had teddy bears that 

3392
02:37:30,741 --> 02:37:33,500
are our friends.
Polar bears are selling us Klondike bars

3393
02:37:33,501 --> 02:37:34,334
and Coca Cola.
We have all this in our head that these 

3394
02:37:36,471 --> 02:37:39,560
are these cute,
awesome things which they are awesome.

3395
02:37:39,561 --> 02:37:42,860
They are beautiful,
but we don't know what they really are.

3396
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:45,440
We have an unrealistic idea what they 
really are.

3397
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:47,510
We might see them in the zoo.
Oh,

3398
02:37:47,511 --> 02:37:49,310
there's the bear in the zoo.
High Bear.

3399
02:37:49,720 --> 02:37:50,553
This is not what they really are and 
unless you have real world experience 

3400
02:37:55,191 --> 02:37:58,700
and where they really are.
Like I was saying to Tom,

3401
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:01,430
the guy who owns the ranch and tell them
land that was saying,

3402
02:38:01,730 --> 02:38:02,563
you get this an amazing place and I 
think you should take people on guided 

3403
02:38:06,951 --> 02:38:09,530
tours that have no intention whatsoever 
of hunting.

3404
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:12,110
Just show them the Rut,
wild elk.

3405
02:38:12,170 --> 02:38:15,350
It's so much greater than any experience
you'll ever have at the zoo.

3406
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:16,543
With me and Colton and Jameson,
we're out there covered in the bushes 

3407
02:38:18,801 --> 02:38:20,100
hiding and hearing,

3408
02:38:23,350 --> 02:38:26,050
hearing these elk scream all out as were
saying,

3409
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:29,080
this is amazing how many people get to 
experience this?

3410
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:33,460
They had these elk had no idea we were 
there and we got to creep in on them and

3411
02:38:33,461 --> 02:38:36,080
watch them just be wild elk and it was 
amazing.

3412
02:38:36,110 --> 02:38:39,190
I mean it was thrilling.
It was incredible with.

3413
02:38:39,550 --> 02:38:41,650
I mean I'm looking all these cows and 
I'm thrilled.

3414
02:38:41,870 --> 02:38:42,703
I've no desire to kill them.
I'm looking at elk that I knew I wasn't 

3415
02:38:45,011 --> 02:38:47,470
gonna kill and I was still enjoying 
every second of it.

3416
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:51,400
Like if people could go and experience 
that and just be.

3417
02:38:51,430 --> 02:38:52,263
I think you would get like one step 
closer to an understanding of that this 

3418
02:38:56,981 --> 02:39:01,981
is this,
this whole world is this wild collection

3419
02:39:02,711 --> 02:39:04,990
of things that are interacting with each
other.

3420
02:39:05,020 --> 02:39:05,370
Right.

3421
02:39:05,370 --> 02:39:07,230
And if you know,
just one piece of it,

3422
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:09,240
you can't really judge.
No.

3423
02:39:09,300 --> 02:39:10,680
All of it,
you know.

3424
02:39:10,681 --> 02:39:11,514
And so what should they do?
Maybe they should trust people who've 

3425
02:39:15,060 --> 02:39:16,470
been there,
who've done it,

3426
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:19,710
who understand,
who aren't bloodthirsty killers,

3427
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:23,460
but actually have been out there and 
know how it all goes together.

3428
02:39:23,490 --> 02:39:27,990
It's okay to trust people like that and 
not think that hunting's bad hunters are

3429
02:39:27,991 --> 02:39:28,980
bad.
So I'd be like,

3430
02:39:29,310 --> 02:39:31,350
maybe I just didn't get it,
but I don't think so.

3431
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:33,950
The hunters had a voice before,
right?

3432
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:34,803
I think before podcast came along,
we relied on people like Rinella or 

3433
02:39:38,561 --> 02:39:41,800
yourself to write books and then you 
have to read those books.

3434
02:39:41,801 --> 02:39:42,790
Nobody wants to read a fucking

3435
02:39:43,090 --> 02:39:44,290
now and your,
your reach.

3436
02:39:44,530 --> 02:39:47,020
So it's a.
what's that saying?

3437
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:50,560
You're preaching to the choir.
So whoever's buying the book.

3438
02:39:50,740 --> 02:39:52,180
Exactly.
It's already on your team.

3439
02:39:52,240 --> 02:39:53,073
Exactly.
So this has allowed us to reach to 

3440
02:39:54,881 --> 02:39:57,610
people,
reach people who maybe are on the team.

3441
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:00,390
Yeah.
And that's what we've been able to,

3442
02:40:00,430 --> 02:40:04,900
to vet the vet it and discuss in detail 
and go through it.

3443
02:40:04,901 --> 02:40:05,734
So I dunno,
I mean I just wish people could have 

3444
02:40:08,591 --> 02:40:10,450
more of an open mind about it.
And,

3445
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:12,940
and it takes time.
It does,

3446
02:40:13,070 --> 02:40:13,891
yeah.
It takes time.

3447
02:40:13,891 --> 02:40:14,010
But

3448
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:14,843
I've got a lot of messages from people 
and I've talked to a lot of people in 

3449
02:40:16,501 --> 02:40:17,334
real life that have said to me that 
they've changed their thoughts on what 

3450
02:40:20,791 --> 02:40:23,640
hunting is by listening to me talk to 
Rinella,

3451
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:25,110
listen to me,
talk to you,

3452
02:40:25,170 --> 02:40:26,003
listen to me talk to remy and John 
Dudley and all these different people 

3453
02:40:29,170 --> 02:40:30,003
where you get a sense of like,
oh well these are like really good 

3454
02:40:32,701 --> 02:40:33,770
people.
These are really.

3455
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:35,033
And these are people that are 
experiencing this wild thing and it 

3456
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:37,254
gives them like this itch.
Because I can remember before I ever 

3457
02:40:38,911 --> 02:40:39,744
hunted for years,
I had this weird itch about it where I 

3458
02:40:43,240 --> 02:40:45,930
had been fishing most of my life.
You know,

3459
02:40:46,120 --> 02:40:50,910
I always go fishing,
but I'd never been hunting until 2012,

3460
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:53,730
but before that I always had these 
thoughts about it.

3461
02:40:53,970 --> 02:40:56,000
Like I'd always sit around and I'd go,
man,

3462
02:40:56,010 --> 02:40:56,843
what it was like,
that's got to be the best way to get 

3463
02:40:58,261 --> 02:40:58,920
meat.

3464
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:01,140
It's got to be the healthiest for you.
And I would buy like,

3465
02:41:01,290 --> 02:41:02,123
I would always order,
like if they had venison and a 

3466
02:41:03,421 --> 02:41:05,530
restaurant,
I'd always order it or you know,

3467
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,280
elk or bison or something like that.
I'm like,

3468
02:41:08,281 --> 02:41:09,270
wow,
it tastes different.

3469
02:41:09,271 --> 02:41:11,490
It tastes.
And that's farm raised bullshit.

3470
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:14,160
You know when you're buying venison and 
a store,

3471
02:41:14,161 --> 02:41:16,800
you're not getting a wild deer.
You're getting some weird.

3472
02:41:16,801 --> 02:41:19,440
Can't sell.
I know you're mostly getting it from New

3473
02:41:19,440 --> 02:41:21,060
Zealand in fact,
which is really weird.

3474
02:41:21,061 --> 02:41:21,894
You're getting a lot of New Zealand elk.
So when I would think about it for the 

3475
02:41:27,841 --> 02:41:28,674
longest time I was getting like little 
fragments of information from these 

3476
02:41:32,551 --> 02:41:34,650
television shows and a lot of them were 
terrible.

3477
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:38,220
I'd watch a lot of hunting shows and 
they would be like real rednecky,

3478
02:41:38,221 --> 02:41:42,450
low brow,
really fucking Yoko dumb dumbs.

3479
02:41:42,710 --> 02:41:43,381
And I'd be like,
well,

3480
02:41:43,381 --> 02:41:45,240
that's,
I don't want to be involved in that.

3481
02:41:45,630 --> 02:41:48,240
And then I found Rinella show.
And that was the first thing that opened

3482
02:41:48,241 --> 02:41:49,080
my eyes.
Oh,

3483
02:41:49,081 --> 02:41:50,250
okay.
All right,

3484
02:41:50,251 --> 02:41:51,084
here's a guy who really smart and well 
read and cooks all these things and he 

3485
02:41:56,371 --> 02:41:59,550
cooks all these animals in this really 
delicious preparation.

3486
02:41:59,551 --> 02:42:00,384
I'm like,
okay,

3487
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:01,523
now I'm intrigued.
And Luckily I got to meet him and 

3488
02:42:03,421 --> 02:42:05,920
luckily it started me on this,
this,

3489
02:42:05,960 --> 02:42:06,793
this journey.
But for most people they're stuck with 

3490
02:42:10,321 --> 02:42:13,290
that wolverine movie.
They're stuck with that image.

3491
02:42:13,310 --> 02:42:13,920
And,

3492
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:17,480
and being involved in this for so long I
can say.

3493
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:19,010
And I,
you know,

3494
02:42:19,310 --> 02:42:21,590
I do a lot of different things.
Um,

3495
02:42:21,650 --> 02:42:24,860
the ultra running community is not a 
hunters.

3496
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:28,010
I mean those are pretty green people and
uh,

3497
02:42:28,730 --> 02:42:32,630
but I can say that for me,
the best people I know,

3498
02:42:32,631 --> 02:42:35,120
my closest friends and people I can 
count on for anything,

3499
02:42:35,121 --> 02:42:38,990
like I said,
our hunters and it's like hunters,

3500
02:42:38,991 --> 02:42:43,991
I think just have a different 
perspective on life or death struggle.

3501
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:49,010
And where that's driven home for me is 
the death threats.

3502
02:42:49,011 --> 02:42:49,844
I get there's comments right now on,
on a couple of my photos from people 

3503
02:42:53,721 --> 02:42:56,600
that said,
somebody said they hope I.

3504
02:42:57,020 --> 02:42:57,853
I get home and my family gets in a car 
crash and I get there just isn't enough 

3505
02:43:03,711 --> 02:43:07,860
time to where the flames are burning 
them and their client that the windows.

3506
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:12,160
That's the kind of stuff people post on 
my photos

3507
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:16,630
today because I hunt hunters.
Meanwhile,

3508
02:43:16,631 --> 02:43:18,340
is that person eating a cheeseburger 
right now?

3509
02:43:18,370 --> 02:43:20,470
I don't know.
Just are they?

3510
02:43:20,471 --> 02:43:23,140
Are they buying their calf than chicken?
No,

3511
02:43:23,141 --> 02:43:24,400
but they're just.
They're weak.

3512
02:43:24,401 --> 02:43:29,401
People that don't understand that how 
life works.

3513
02:43:29,920 --> 02:43:32,740
Hunters understand the preciousness of 
life.

3514
02:43:32,920 --> 02:43:36,760
We take life to sustain ourself.
We accept that fact,

3515
02:43:37,090 --> 02:43:39,790
so we appreciate life.
We appreciate friendship.

3516
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:44,200
We appreciate somebody who's there for 
you because you've been down,

3517
02:43:44,201 --> 02:43:47,560
you've been up,
you've killed animals.

3518
02:43:47,650 --> 02:43:51,070
You know what goes into to eating and 
surviving.

3519
02:43:51,730 --> 02:43:55,540
Somebody like that puts on the blinders 
judges.

3520
02:43:55,541 --> 02:43:56,374
People wants my family to die.
They don't even really what they're 

3521
02:44:00,341 --> 02:44:01,690
doing is just trying to hurt your 
feelings,

3522
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:04,480
but hunt,
but that's what I'm saying.

3523
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:07,090
Hunters won't do that.
Hunters are,

3524
02:44:08,350 --> 02:44:09,183
I dunno.

3525
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:10,113
I think we can generalize because 
there's some hunters that are pieces of 

3526
02:44:12,051 --> 02:44:12,800
shit,
you know,

3527
02:44:12,800 --> 02:44:17,270
it's like I know are hunters,
so you know some of the best hunters.

3528
02:44:17,370 --> 02:44:19,970
I'm just.
I think that's when you get to the elite

3529
02:44:20,030 --> 02:44:20,863
of anything,
you get to people that have exceptional 

3530
02:44:22,551 --> 02:44:23,384
character that have allowed them to get 
really truly great at any pursuit and 

3531
02:44:27,711 --> 02:44:30,500
now you're talking about guys like Leila
Kosky or Remy Warren.

3532
02:44:30,501 --> 02:44:32,090
You're talking about the elite of the 
elite,

3533
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:32,953
right?
If they were doing anything that would 

3534
02:44:34,131 --> 02:44:34,964
be amazing at it and I think that when 
you're talking about the character of 

3535
02:44:37,671 --> 02:44:38,504
those people,
those are people that have overcome 

3536
02:44:39,831 --> 02:44:43,640
incredible odds to become very good at 
something that's insanely difficult,

3537
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,910
which is bow hunting and I think a lot 
of these people.

3538
02:44:46,911 --> 02:44:48,680
The problem is,
first of all,

3539
02:44:48,681 --> 02:44:50,490
there's an anonymous communication on 
the Internet.

3540
02:44:50,520 --> 02:44:51,353
That's a problem.

3541
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:53,660
The problem is talking to people in 
person.

3542
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:56,660
You get social cues.
If I say something mean to you and I see

3543
02:44:56,661 --> 02:44:58,370
I hurt your feelings,
you feel it.

3544
02:44:58,790 --> 02:45:00,620
You trying to like reach out and hurt 
someone.

3545
02:45:00,621 --> 02:45:02,180
You're not even in the room.
You're throwing a ball,

3546
02:45:02,210 --> 02:45:05,120
you're like closing your eyes and 
they're on a bomb over a bridge,

3547
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,340
you know you're not,
you're not seeing them.

3548
02:45:07,370 --> 02:45:08,300
It's not,
it's not.

3549
02:45:08,360 --> 02:45:09,193
It's a bad form of communication for the
human animal because unless you commit 

3550
02:45:14,090 --> 02:45:19,090
to only being nice and kind or friendly 
or or funny online,

3551
02:45:19,770 --> 02:45:20,603
unless you commit to doing that and 
never trying to like reach out and add 

3552
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:24,133
attack someone and hurt someone,
you're using this whole thing wrong 

3553
02:45:27,351 --> 02:45:28,184
because you're taking advantage of this 
weird little loophole that existed in 

3554
02:45:30,321 --> 02:45:31,154
communication where you can communicate 
with someone with no repercussions 

3555
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:35,570
because if someone said that in front of
your face,

3556
02:45:35,630 --> 02:45:36,920
oh,
they never would though.

3557
02:45:36,950 --> 02:45:38,600
Exactly.
But if they did,

3558
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:40,730
you know it would get fucking hot.
Right?

3559
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:42,470
If someone said that to me in front of 
my face,

3560
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:44,870
it would be very hard for me to stop 
from assaulting them.

3561
02:45:45,060 --> 02:45:49,860
It just seems weird that hunters don't 
go to to a Vegan.

3562
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:51,333
How do you know if they have pages?
I assume they have pages and just talk 

3563
02:45:53,740 --> 02:45:55,110
shit.
Tons of them.

3564
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,420
Yeah,
but we won't do that.

3565
02:45:57,580 --> 02:45:58,413
Well,
it's,

3566
02:45:58,570 --> 02:45:59,403
you know,
it's not something they're not doing 

3567
02:46:01,811 --> 02:46:05,140
anything that we oppose,
right?

3568
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,150
Well,
I don't oppose people eating vegetables.

3569
02:46:07,151 --> 02:46:07,984
I eat vegetables.
They in their mind that we are doing 

3570
02:46:12,351 --> 02:46:13,184
something that is immoral or that is on 
evolve and I think that's just 

3571
02:46:17,811 --> 02:46:18,644
ignorance.
They don't understand that we are here 

3572
02:46:20,091 --> 02:46:20,924
for a very temporary short amount of 
time and the more we embrace the 

3573
02:46:25,101 --> 02:46:30,101
richness and complexity that is life in 
the life eats life struggle and the last

3574
02:46:31,761 --> 02:46:35,180
we fingerpoint and more.
We try to look at our own footprint,

3575
02:46:35,181 --> 02:46:39,530
our carbon footprint and the 
sustainability footprint that we live,

3576
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:42,080
that we leave on this world and in my 
eyes,

3577
02:46:42,350 --> 02:46:43,183
there's no more sustainable way of 
living than supporting conservation 

3578
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:51,380
through buying tags and supporting it 
through buying outdoor equipment,

3579
02:46:51,381 --> 02:46:52,214
which what is,
what is the number of percentage of 

3580
02:46:53,121 --> 02:46:53,954
taxes that go from when you buy hunting 
equipment that goes straight to 

3581
02:46:57,051 --> 02:46:57,884
conservation.

3582
02:46:57,930 --> 02:46:59,750
It's like 11 percent I.
something like that.

3583
02:46:59,751 --> 02:47:00,584
Yeah.
Which is millions and billions of 

3584
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:04,940
dollars.
Like Rocky Mountain elk foundation has a

3585
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:05,833
great bunch of charts that show how much
money each year hunters to contributing 

3586
02:47:11,570 --> 02:47:13,580
to wildlife conservation.
It's stunning.

3587
02:47:13,710 --> 02:47:14,543
It's billions of dollars and it is 
number one in conservation by a fucking 

3588
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:19,900
long shot.
I mean,

3589
02:47:19,910 --> 02:47:20,743
it's the second place is like a tiny 
fraction of what hunting contributes to 

3590
02:47:26,331 --> 02:47:27,470
conservation.
Yeah.

3591
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:29,240
Yeah.
Most people don't know that.

3592
02:47:29,630 --> 02:47:32,480
It takes these kinds of conversations 
for people to find out.

3593
02:47:32,530 --> 02:47:33,363
The hunters know that hunters do know 
that his gun and ammo taxes result in 

3594
02:47:37,041 --> 02:47:41,420
one point,
1 billion for world war for wildlife and

3595
02:47:41,421 --> 02:47:42,254
conservation each year.
One point 1 billion that's just gun and 

3596
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:48,583
ammo taxes.
Forget about bows and arrows and a 

3597
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:53,803
hunting equipment and clothing and all 
the different factors that play in 

3598
02:47:59,360 --> 02:48:01,670
different pieces that contribute to 
conservation.

3599
02:48:01,671 --> 02:48:02,504
It's an amazing amount and you're not 
getting that from people who are 

3600
02:48:06,171 --> 02:48:08,990
philanthropists.
You're not getting that from people that

3601
02:48:08,991 --> 02:48:11,180
just want to be nice and contribute to 
animals.

3602
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:12,930
You get a tiny fraction of that.
Yep,

3603
02:48:13,240 --> 02:48:17,170
that's true.
And you know that whole thing.

3604
02:48:17,171 --> 02:48:18,910
You know,
Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,

3605
02:48:18,911 --> 02:48:23,911
they came up with the hunting is 
conservation and it's like a little part

3606
02:48:24,311 --> 02:48:26,140
of that though,
when I hunt,

3607
02:48:26,770 --> 02:48:28,750
I don't think I'm going to go out here 
and conserve,

3608
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:29,913
you know,
I think I want to kill a mature animal 

3609
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:32,413
or take me home to my family.
The byproduct of what we do is 

3610
02:48:34,451 --> 02:48:35,284
conservation and that's where that money
comes in and that's where the hunt 

3611
02:48:38,530 --> 02:48:39,363
hunters,
you know,

3612
02:48:39,410 --> 02:48:42,850
buying the hunting licenses and honey 
tags because people have told me,

3613
02:48:43,180 --> 02:48:44,320
well,
are,

3614
02:48:44,570 --> 02:48:45,403
are you,
you're taking credit for being a 

3615
02:48:47,441 --> 02:48:51,070
conservationist,
but would you do that if you didn't have

3616
02:48:51,071 --> 02:48:52,240
to?
And I'm like,

3617
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:55,750
it doesn't matter my money,
my money is there.

3618
02:48:55,751 --> 02:48:57,550
Whether I won,
I would do it or not.

3619
02:48:57,560 --> 02:48:57,680
Well

3620
02:48:57,680 --> 02:49:00,980
also here's an important thing hunters 
chose to,

3621
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:01,863
to,
to vote to put that amount of money 

3622
02:49:03,741 --> 02:49:06,110
towards conservation.
This is something that nobody fought,

3623
02:49:06,200 --> 02:49:08,220
right?
We've never fought,

3624
02:49:08,221 --> 02:49:10,080
oh,
that's too expensive or this or that.

3625
02:49:10,081 --> 02:49:10,914
No.
11.

3626
02:49:11,310 --> 02:49:12,210
Oh,
one over money.

3627
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:13,710
Gladly do it.
Yeah.

3628
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:15,330
And it's.
But it's like,

3629
02:49:15,630 --> 02:49:16,800
you know,
I don't,

3630
02:49:17,310 --> 02:49:18,143
I'm a hunter first.
I'm a conservationist because I'm a 

3631
02:49:21,901 --> 02:49:22,734
hunter,
but you're also a hunter because people 

3632
02:49:25,291 --> 02:49:26,124
before you were conservationists and 
they made sure that the hunting was 

3633
02:49:28,951 --> 02:49:29,784
protected and that you didn't have to be
a conservation is first and then hope 

3634
02:49:33,151 --> 02:49:34,940
that your kids are.
They're excited.

3635
02:49:35,220 --> 02:49:37,740
Could be hunters because the world would
be in more balanced.

3636
02:49:38,040 --> 02:49:40,860
We tied them to.
They tied them together and it's,

3637
02:49:40,970 --> 02:49:43,470
it's.
This model's worked so well.

3638
02:49:43,560 --> 02:49:47,130
It does work so well,
but it's been represented so poorly.

3639
02:49:47,131 --> 02:49:49,410
I think up until recently,
people just don't,

3640
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:50,430
haven't understood what.

3641
02:49:50,460 --> 02:49:51,293
I didn't understood what Stan,
what it was until I became involved in 

3642
02:49:53,551 --> 02:49:54,300
it.
Right?

3643
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:57,330
Yeah,
so I'm very thankful for people like you

3644
02:49:57,570 --> 02:49:59,970
and people like Steve Rinella.
That opened the door for me,

3645
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:04,140
so and then I feel like as much as I 
preach about this,

3646
02:50:04,141 --> 02:50:07,050
as much as I'm redundant is fucking 
annoying to a lot of people listening.

3647
02:50:07,560 --> 02:50:08,393
I think I have a responsibility to share
what I've learned and to communicate 

3648
02:50:12,871 --> 02:50:14,940
about this.
Even though people get mad at me.

3649
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:17,220
You're stope killing animals.
All caps.

3650
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:18,770
Yeah,
they're really mad.

3651
02:50:18,771 --> 02:50:19,470
Yeah.
Okay.

3652
02:50:19,470 --> 02:50:21,960
Go stop eating grain.
You fuck it if you,

3653
02:50:21,961 --> 02:50:24,060
if you look at the people don't 
understand you go.

3654
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:25,313
We've talked about this before.
If you look at a greenfield after it's 

3655
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:28,890
been plowed,
what do you see?

3656
02:50:28,891 --> 02:50:31,130
Vultures flying over his wit.
Yeah.

3657
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:33,360
Once I combine goes through and gets the
wheat,

3658
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:37,170
I mean there's all sorts of dead animals
of vulture buzzards flying around.

3659
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:40,110
And uh,
I mean even so you drink coffee.

3660
02:50:40,500 --> 02:50:42,780
How do you think that the coffee beans 
were?

3661
02:50:42,781 --> 02:50:44,910
Those are grown.
There's no weeds.

3662
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:45,840
There's no,
you know,

3663
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:49,260
I mean it's just there's animals dying 
for your coffee,

3664
02:50:49,630 --> 02:50:50,463
get those animals dying for everything.
And I think that the closer we can get 

3665
02:50:55,471 --> 02:50:59,440
to a real,
true organic relationship with,

3666
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:01,020
with life,
with all life,

3667
02:51:01,021 --> 02:51:02,550
plant life,
I mean,

3668
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:04,710
I fucking hate the idea.
Pesticides,

3669
02:51:04,920 --> 02:51:05,753
you know,
I hate the idea that we're spraying 

3670
02:51:07,111 --> 02:51:12,111
things on certain plants to kill them so
that we can grow other plants like large

3671
02:51:12,811 --> 02:51:15,360
scale agriculture.
When you look at a giant Cornfield,

3672
02:51:15,960 --> 02:51:18,810
ladies and gentleman,
that is one of the most unnatural things

3673
02:51:18,811 --> 02:51:19,644
in all of life,
and it is one of the most weirdest 

3674
02:51:22,381 --> 02:51:24,750
things.
We've just accepted as being natural.

3675
02:51:24,960 --> 02:51:25,793
It's not natural and it's one of the 
reasons why they have to dump nitrogen 

3676
02:51:28,171 --> 02:51:32,910
into the soil and all kinds of other 
shit and pesticides and use roundup and,

3677
02:51:32,920 --> 02:51:33,753
and,
and use giant machines to grind up all 

3678
02:51:35,641 --> 02:51:36,180
this stuff.

3679
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:38,820
And that's not.
I'm not saying you shouldn't eat wheat,

3680
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:43,710
but I'm saying all of this is unnatural.
Cities are unnatural,

3681
02:51:44,040 --> 02:51:44,873
this is unnatural,
and the more we understand about the 

3682
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:52,580
true nature of our interactions with 
this life that we are,

3683
02:51:52,581 --> 02:51:55,650
we are surrounded with the better off 
we'll all be.

3684
02:51:55,770 --> 02:51:59,460
And it doesn't mean finger pointing or 
saying that you should watch your family

3685
02:51:59,461 --> 02:52:01,920
die in a fire.
Like that's not helping anybody.

3686
02:52:01,921 --> 02:52:04,520
They don't understand this.
It's just,

3687
02:52:04,650 --> 02:52:05,483
it's just digging in on both sides.
It's sort of the same thing that people 

3688
02:52:07,991 --> 02:52:08,824
do in politics.
You know the right hates the left and 

3689
02:52:10,871 --> 02:52:11,704
the left hates the right.
Nothing gets done because everybody's 

3690
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:17,050
just digging in,
supporting their side and it's just,

3691
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:18,753
we all need to realize that this life 
that we're experiencing is far more 

3692
02:52:22,121 --> 02:52:22,954
nuanced and requires far more research 
and far more understanding of all the 

3693
02:52:26,621 --> 02:52:27,970
different pieces that are moving.

3694
02:52:28,150 --> 02:52:32,170
That was another great thing about that 
hunting trip is I had no idea what,

3695
02:52:32,640 --> 02:52:33,473
what,
um,

3696
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:34,743
people were attacking Donald Trump for,
for about a week or anybody we're going 

3697
02:52:40,620 --> 02:52:44,830
to fight North Korea or didn't know 
anything is awesome.

3698
02:52:45,130 --> 02:52:45,963
I was just hoping that no one got nuked 
and the time that we had no service for 

3699
02:52:49,541 --> 02:52:50,374
a week,
I was just hoping there wasn't a new 

3700
02:52:52,540 --> 02:52:54,670
attack or Kim Jong,
uhm,

3701
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:57,370
didn't shoot a rocket over Japan or 
wherever the fuck it was.

3702
02:52:57,400 --> 02:53:00,160
I didn't know any of that and everything
worked out just fine.

3703
02:53:00,161 --> 02:53:03,040
So that was a win win.
And we're here.

3704
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:04,420
Yeah.
Well listen brother,

3705
02:53:04,480 --> 02:53:06,940
let's wrap this up.
We just did three hours.

3706
02:53:07,630 --> 02:53:09,060
Amazing.
It goes by like that.

3707
02:53:09,100 --> 02:53:09,821
That's good.
Yeah.

3708
02:53:09,821 --> 02:53:11,200
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

3709
02:53:11,380 --> 02:53:12,910
Thank you for getting me into bow 
hunting.

3710
02:53:13,240 --> 02:53:15,190
Thanks for taking me on this epic trip.
Uh,

3711
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:17,250
thanks to under armor,
uh,

3712
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:18,910
thanks to uh,
Tom,

3713
02:53:18,911 --> 02:53:23,320
the owner of the ranch and everybody 
else involved and that's it.

3714
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:24,910
Alright.
Alright fuckers,

3715
02:53:24,911 --> 02:53:25,990
that's it.
See you soon.

3716
02:53:26,020 --> 02:53:27,180
Bye.
Keep hammering,

3717
02:53:27,370 --> 02:53:28,203
hammering pitches.

3718
02:53:32,410 --> 02:53:37,410
The.
