1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,750
Couple of hours and yeah,
we've got the gun.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,160
What's up gentlemen?
How are you?

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,680
Good,
thanks for having people tune into this

4
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,040
podcast.
I got Brendan Burns and Jason Harrington

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,180
who have run a company called
[inaudible],

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,280
which is the premiere.
If,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,930
if,
if you could look at your company like

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,190
in comparison to a lot of other like
sporting good companies and like if he,

9
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,710
if people think about like a hunting
company,

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,380
you think about,
oh well it's like some duck dynasty type

11
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,880
shit.
You guys,

12
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:34,881
what I like about your company is
there's not a lot of people that take

13
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:40,310
what you guys do,
like make clothing and gear and take it

14
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,770
to the most technical and most
intelligent.

15
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,630
Like what is the best shit you can
possibly make set and go do that.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,910
That's it.
But because of that,

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,750
this company has become this gigantic
company I found out about you guys buy

18
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,420
from my friend,
I'm Martine to Patellas,

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,291
uh,
who,

20
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,300
uh,
works for meat eater.

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,510
He was wearing these clothes.
I go,

22
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,380
what's,
what's going on with that?

23
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:02,550
What do you got there?
And he's like,

24
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,140
this is cool.
This is a new company that's out there,

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,200
this feel,
this filled,

26
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,340
that filled this,
this is an ultra light is the best kind

27
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,260
of fabric is.
So he started telling me about your

28
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,860
company and I just love when people go
for it.

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,240
I love when people like people wouldn't
think that there's like this big market

30
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,510
to create the most technical,
most ridiculously engineered hunting

31
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:24,781
clothes.
You would say,

32
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,640
well what the fuck?
Who's doing that?

33
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,930
Like where,
who cares?

34
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:28,950
Yeah,
exactly.

35
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,560
Who needs it.
But then listening to you guys on a

36
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,020
couple of podcasts,
I'm like,

37
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:36,150
these guys are fucking sharp dudes.
Super Sharp,

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,110
intelligent people who just happened to
be in love with hunting.

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,970
And so you've taken this mindset,
this,

40
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,800
this achievement oriented mindset and
put it towards this company.

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,750
And it's fascinating to me.
Yeah.

42
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,790
It's um,
you know,

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,320
I just got into it because I wanted to
make stuff.

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,590
I couldn't find,
I wanted better performing products.

45
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:58,650
It's what you know,
we created the category was sick of back

46
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:03,651
of the day is back in 2004 because I was
wearing all mountain their anger and

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,770
wondered why I was the only person that
wanted that style,

48
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,800
that type,
that performance level of hunting.

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,020
I didn't believe that I was alone and
came up with a concept,

50
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,220
introduced it and oh six to the hunting
market and exploded credit,

51
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,410
the entire technical total category.
And it's just,

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,940
it's now what everyone's chasing.
It's with everyone wants to wear and

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,530
makes a significant difference for our
customers in the mountains.

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,000
Well,
there's a bit of this,

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,120
a lot of,
uh,

56
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,510
hunting people are kind of fashion east
does in a way.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Totally.
Like,

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,011
Ooh,
what do you got there?

59
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,810
I was an underwriter who was at first
light.

60
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,270
Like they start like looking at your
stuff,

61
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:38,400
almost like girls look at shoes and
purses and shit.

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,080
It's,
it's really kind of interesting that

63
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,651
way.
Well,

64
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,540
no one likes to go to a hunting camp,
be out geared.

65
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,980
Right.
Your buddy's got the coolest,

66
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,820
latest step.
They're like,

67
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,990
what?
Well,

68
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:47,790
what is that?
One of the reasons why I wanted to have

69
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:52,791
you guys on is cause I've done the best
job I can of trying to educate people as

70
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:57,180
to what I see when I talk to people that
are really intelligent,

71
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,920
really ethical,
very,

72
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,430
very involved

73
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,780
people that are fanatics about hunting.
Because I think there people have of

74
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:07,720
distorted perception of what hunting
really is.

75
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,140
Totally do.
It's like Yahoo's beer drinkers being

76
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,890
Baba Baba banners is above a redneck
striving and drinking beer,

77
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,840
shooting stuff out of the truck.
And it's so not that our customer base

78
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:22,180
and what we do,
I mean it's a true lifestyle as a

79
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,250
heritage.
It's been passed down in my family.

80
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,900
It's where we live and breathe.
It's why I'm I trained every day.

81
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,980
Uh,
it's what my focus is on my life and,

82
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:32,710
and what I've done for a career in a
business.

83
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,660
And it's,
there's a lot to it.

84
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,090
And the places we go,
we require that or you're going to pay a

85
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,440
huge,
huge price.

86
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,870
And so it's a way for me to test myself
as a,

87
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,460
as a human being,
as a man,

88
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,443
as a hunter.

89
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,750
And a life.
And it's something that,

90
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:47,770
uh,
you know,

91
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,200
is a big,
big part of me.

92
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,140
It's been passed down from my father and
I'm passing down to my kids and,

93
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,401
uh,
you know,

94
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,830
we've been hunters for 2 million years
and fricking proud of it.

95
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,500
A lot of people shy away from it.
And it's something that,

96
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,180
uh,
is really,

97
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,220
really obviously very important part of
my life.

98
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,950
Well,
there's not a lot of high performance,

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,210
you know,
super skilled things where you also have

100
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,450
a lowest common denominator kind of guy
that you're associated with.

101
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,190
I mean,
if mountaineers,

102
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,820
you know,
had a guy that was wearing a white tank

103
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,860
top and was down at the climbing gym,
fallen,

104
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,560
operate in his head every week,
people would perceive him slightly

105
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,940
different.
He runs,

106
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:26,770
you know,
the guys that are doing the most extreme

107
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:30,860
stuff in the world and the purse,
the perceived person that's down here.

108
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,550
So you know what people,
you get lumped in with the lowest common

109
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:36,040
denominator guy,
which is not not the case at all.

110
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,850
I mean,
yes,

111
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,260
that's a really good point.
Yeah.

112
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,573
And,
uh,

113
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,750
yeah.
I mean it's,

114
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:43,500
it's uh,
it's certainly what we're doing and

115
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:45,010
we'll,
we're testing our products.

116
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,450
I mean,
we argue that it's,

117
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,660
it's a different format than even
outdoor gear.

118
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,630
I mean were when the weather's bad and
you're on a climb,

119
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,790
you stay in your tent when the weather's
bad and we're on a hunt,

120
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,230
what do we do?
Yeah.

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Especially if you're not bringing much
food and you're counting on killing

122
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:00,940
something and eating it up,
they're totally,

123
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:03,280
it's,
it's an endeavor that's a very,

124
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,200
very difficult and misunderstood
endeavor.

125
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,470
He really is and I think companies like
yours and what you guys are doing in the

126
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,310
videos that you release on youtube,
especially when you're going over the

127
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:16,630
extreme engineering involved in your
packs and your gear and all the

128
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:17,020
different thing.

129
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,410
To me that stuff's fascinating.
It is because I love people that are

130
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,590
just going for it,
that are just engineering the shit out

131
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,650
of things.
You guys are chopping down toothbrushes

132
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,350
to make them lighter and all this stuff
you're doing.

133
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,420
Like I was listening to one of the
podcasts,

134
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:35,740
we talk about your excel sheet that you
make a spreadsheet that you made every,

135
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,410
every hunt.
You weigh everything out so you know

136
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,930
exactly what everything,
ways before you're going onto a

137
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:41,950
mountain,
you have to,

138
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,870
for what we're doing.
Yeah.

139
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,580
I mean you look at any endurance sports
and you look at,

140
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:50,290
cycling is a great example.
I mean ounces they've proven are huge.

141
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,140
If you're climbing on a bike and the
bike weight and the,

142
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,230
and the bodyweight on all that leads to
better performance.

143
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,980
And we found the same to

144
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,440
be with with what we're doing on
backpack cards.

145
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:04,400
I mean every ounce over a 10 day hunt
really adds up in calorie burn and

146
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,980
calorie deficit,
which then turns out to be performance

147
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,170
and know well from training.
Well it's also,

148
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:14,171
you guys have engineered these clothing.
The clothing line is incredibly quiet,

149
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,480
which is also really important thing.
And there's,

150
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,920
there's so many different levels to
getting it right when it comes to

151
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,500
hunting gear,
getting it right when it comes to,

152
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,610
you know,
I mean,

153
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,740
it could be the difference between
success and failure.

154
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,970
And this is one of the things that I
wanted to kind of highlight about this

155
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,880
pursuit.
Um,

156
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,500
and I don't like to call hunting a sport
or a discipline mean call whatever you

157
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:37,490
want,
but it's not,

158
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,080
you know.
Yeah.

159
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,650
It's,
it's,

160
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,730
it's,
it is what it is.

161
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,680
It's weird that you have to lump it into
this other thing,

162
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,280
but I think that people have a distorted
perception of it because of what you

163
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:49,110
said because of this lowest common
denominator guide,

164
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:50,240
the,
the Bubba thing.

165
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,130
But the more I've gotten into it,
the more I've met people like you guys

166
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,320
or people like Cam Haynes or Steve
Rinella,

167
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,540
Remy Warren,
and you get deep end.

168
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,410
You realize like this is a really
difficult discipline.

169
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,850
Very,
very difficult.

170
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:05,750
That has many,
many,

171
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,610
many layers to,
it really does.

172
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,600
I mean,
you look at the,

173
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,340
some of the expeditions we were doing up
north,

174
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,170
you know,
we'd go up to the Yukon or Alaska or

175
00:07:12,171 --> 00:07:15,320
northwest territory's and when we're
going from point a to point b,

176
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,450
like normal exposition with,
but there were hunting,

177
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,650
yeah.
On top of that.

178
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,450
Exactly.
And then we've got to manage the game

179
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,540
that we take out on top of that,
the weight and the extremes and the

180
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,680
conditions and the weather.
I mean,

181
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,660
it adds to,
I mean,

182
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,210
you have to be really well prepared.
Really.

183
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,350
Um,
physically,

184
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:32,720
mentally,
and also with the right equipment and

185
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:33,554
gear.

186
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,910
Yeah.
I mean you had in the mountains on some

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,691
of the stuff we're doing.
I mean,

188
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:38,450
it's not like it's comparable with
mountaineering,

189
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,920
but I mean,
you don't have to,

190
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:41,510
you know,
it's not a to b.

191
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,550
You just got to survive to ADB.
I mean,

192
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,950
you have to thrive in the mountains.
You have to understand what's going on

193
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,930
with the animals.
You're up early or up late.

194
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,310
I mean,
it's,

195
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,450
it's even more in depth.
And then just getting from point a to

196
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,950
point b.
And a lot of these places were going,

197
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:58,040
there is no reason to ever go there
unless you were hunting.

198
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,410
I mean,
just some random mountain in the middle

199
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,980
of the ice glacier that not particularly
tall,

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,150
not particularly,
but like there's no reason to go there

201
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,860
unless you had something to go there and
look for.

202
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,070
And that's the cool thing we were seeing
stuff that nobody would ever go see.

203
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,890
Yeah.
It's like a to B with a very complex

204
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:14,900
biological puzzle.
Totally.

205
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,601
Yeah.
It's,

206
00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,360
it's so,
it's so different than,

207
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,890
like I said,
a lot of people think of it.

208
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:20,690
And one of the things I like about your
companies,

209
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,240
you guys are represented by this big
horn sheep.

210
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,010
I mean,
that is like a part of your logo,

211
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,160
which is one of the most difficult
animals to pursue sheep pennings at

212
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:28,880
pinnacle,
man.

213
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,780
And it's,
uh,

214
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,920
it defines for Brennan and I and for
people in the company and the people who

215
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:34,970
associate with a brand.
I mean,

216
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:38,090
it is the ultimate dream.
It's what we all dreamt about growing

217
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,860
up.
As someday I would be a sheep hunter.

218
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll earn the right to go sheep hunting
because it's so difficult.

219
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,400
It is.
The opportunities are limited.

220
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,760
The,
and it's an animal that lives in places

221
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:50,420
that we,
you know,

222
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,980
we can visit,
but we can't live there.

223
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,870
I mean,
they live in places that you just,

224
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,303
you know,
the,

225
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,720
we,
we only get to like a snippet into

226
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,100
their,
into their life.

227
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,540
Cause it's places you can't,
you just,

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,660
you just can't live.
I mean,

229
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,530
you can't go there and you can die.
Absolutely.

230
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,500
Absolutely.
Yeah.

231
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,810
I mean a Cam Haines,
good buddy Roy Roth died just this past

232
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,630
season fell 700 feet to his death while
she hunting.

233
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,190
I was hunting.
Uh,

234
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,600
I had a tag in Alaska and that you gach
um,

235
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,860
couple a little ways over from there and
we went 37 miles in,

236
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,694
up,
uh,

237
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,920
up to,
to two forks of a glacier.

238
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,470
And I mean,
we got to where you could physically a

239
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,900
human being without climbing gear could
not go any further.

240
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:34,740
Where I killed my sheep is fall 15 year
old ram living up in the rocks.

241
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,900
And I mean it like that.
That is some of the,

242
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,320
that's some of the most,
that's some of the toughest country in

243
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,040
the world.

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,120
It means brushy and ice and nasty.
And you know,

245
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,790
again,
it's not,

246
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,120
it's not pleasurable to go in there like
you have to,

247
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,060
to really go into something like that.
You Do,

248
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,870
you have to have a goal or a reason to
be in there.

249
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,820
It's not like I'm going to go grind out
this miserable brush and you know,

250
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,803
poor,
you know,

251
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,360
shitty rainy weather home.
He,

252
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,051
yeah,
he just like,

253
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,990
why would you be there?
Cause you go there because you want to

254
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,740
see,
you know,

255
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,950
is this is going to test me and you want
to see if you can match wits with this

256
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,240
animal and you know,
you,

257
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,580
you want to go see if you're up for the
challenge.

258
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,700
I mean that's what we've been doing for,
it's the world's oldest and greatest

259
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,241
sport.
I mean,

260
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,050
if you're not,
you know,

261
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,050
you were either a hunter or a berry
picker and the the level of intensity

262
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,720
that's involved in that moment when you
actually try to take that animal after

263
00:10:24,721 --> 00:10:29,721
that incredible hiking after 37 miles of
risking your life to get to that point.

264
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:34,050
And then that moments there,
just the extreme amount of pressure and

265
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:39,051
intensity involved in that moment.
That to me is what defines the real

266
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:44,310
challenge,
the ultimate challenge of hunting and

267
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,850
this idea that it's a bunch of people
that like killing animals or it's a

268
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:50,370
bunch of fat Yahoos and sit around
drinking beer.

269
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,040
No,
there's way,

270
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,350
there's way more to this thing.
This is more an insane,

271
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,530
like really primal pursuit.
It is.

272
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,710
We always say you're either a hunter,
you're like Brendon mentioned a berry

273
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,200
picker.
It's in our DNA if you're a hunter.

274
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,230
And to be able to test that against the
toughest conditions against the hardest

275
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,560
animals,
to hunt the most remote places is to me

276
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,740
the ultimate test of being a human being
and ultimate test of being a hunter.

277
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,190
And that's what drives me and what we
do.

278
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,450
And why they train year round.

279
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,650
Why,
I'm always thinking about gear,

280
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:23,730
about food,
about Wade,

281
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,110
about uh,
you know,

282
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:25,740
what,
what,

283
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,610
how I could improve from what I learned
on last year sent to this coming

284
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,370
seasons.
Um,

285
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,060
and preparation of it is a,
it's fun.

286
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,033
Yeah,
I love it.

287
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,360
I live it and breathe it and uh,
it's,

288
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,070
it's challenging.
It's really challenging.

289
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,380
Well,
it unfolded for me,

290
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,510
uh,
and it still continues to do so because

291
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:44,340
I've only been doing it for four years.
I mean,

292
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:48,300
Rinella got me involved and he took me
out to Montana in 2012.

293
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,920
And uh,
you know,

294
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:50,361
I was like,
oh,

295
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,450
hey,
this is kind of be interesting.

296
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,550
Let's see what this is all about.
Because I had watched shows and I read

297
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:56,920
some stuff about it,
but one of the things that he said,

298
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,401
he's like,
man,

299
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:00,220
there's a steep learning curve to this.
There's a steep lines.

300
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,210
Then it goes long.

301
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:01,961
And I was like,
well,

302
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,840
how long can it go?
He fucking find an animal.

303
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,930
You shoot it and kill it.
Need it seem so hard.

304
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,820
But then as you get into it,
you realize and then of course bow

305
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,830
hunting,
which is the most difficult of the most

306
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,080
difficult pursuits.
And as you get into it,

307
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:15,040
you realize like,
oh,

308
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,340
this is like some crazy puzzle.
It's like some crazy challenge that you

309
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,830
have to figure that also involves a way
to procure your food.

310
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,500
It does.
And it's a skill set you never quit

311
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:29,260
learning on every time you go out.
I learned something new.

312
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,460
Yeah,
there's a,

313
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,380
there's a natural progression you go
through.

314
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:34,270
I mean,
it's like you're just excited to be

315
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,104
there.
Right.

316
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,530
And then your,
and then you see it with people you've

317
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:39,880
take out through first time.
They're just like,

318
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,530
oh,
kind of what's what's going on here.

319
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:43,330
And you know,
and then then all of a sudden they get a

320
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:45,670
little click and it's like,
I want to get one,

321
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,110
you know?
And then,

322
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,060
you know,
that's usually a couple of years.

323
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:49,780
And then,
and then,

324
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,580
yeah,
I want to get,

325
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,900
I'm going to get a nicer one than one I
got last time and I want,

326
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,520
you want to do something a little more
challenging.

327
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:56,590
And it just keeps progressing until
like,

328
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,750
you know,
until you get,

329
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,310
you know,
wherever it ends and it's,

330
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:03,760
it's you,
you're hunting the toughest animals,

331
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:06,100
the biggest animals,
the oldest animals and the toughest

332
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:09,430
conditions and being successful and know
a lot of people won't get there.

333
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,360
But it's,
it's,

334
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,790
it's always a challenge.
It's something that never gets old.

335
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,943
I mean it's,
it's,

336
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,050
you know,
as comparable to any athletic event only

337
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:18,610
you can do it for your whole life,
you know,

338
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,730
I mean there's lots of stuff you do
athletic and then in growing up or

339
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,630
whatever and it was like,
but it doesn't really translate,

340
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,730
you know,
a college wrestler that doesn't

341
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,220
translate that well to do the rest of
your life.

342
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,880
If you're that dude down there at the
intermural wrestling like Ah,

343
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,090
you've missed,
you know,

344
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,160
hunting is the one thing that is just
throughout your entire life.

345
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,510
Depending on where you're at.
I mean,

346
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,020
you can,
it's,

347
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,990
you can always continue to learn and
pursue it.

348
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,090
And you know,
sometimes you,

349
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,300
you know,
you don't have a ton of time,

350
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,520
you can do a short on sometimes,
you know,

351
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,560
things are going well,
you can do something that's,

352
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,730
you know,
an epic adventure.

353
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:54,280
But it's always a challenge.
It never gets easy though.

354
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean,
the,

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,310
the,
the animal you killed last time does not

356
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:01,150
care.
The new animal you're hunting does not

357
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,980
care what you got last time.
You have to go out,

358
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:05,080
you gotta be sharp every single time,
you know?

359
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:05,990
Yeah.
And

360
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,060
everything has to be done right every
single time.

361
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:08,541
Yep.
Yeah.

362
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:13,541
And what I like about guys like youtube
is you take two dudes like yourselves

363
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,390
who are both like real goal oriented
savages.

364
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,110
And you put together a company like this
that pursues that one ultimate

365
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,750
experience and says,
what is the best shit that we can make?

366
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:26,450
What is the best way we can pursue this?
We do.

367
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,610
Um,
and that's why I built,

368
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:29,391
could you,
the way it did,

369
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:31,220
having learned from Sitka selling to
retailers,

370
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,000
the limits of what we can produce.
And I was super frustrated.

371
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,480
The fact that I was walking away from
the best materials and walking away from

372
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,570
the best innovations.
And when we sold that company to Gore

373
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,310
Tex,
I had the freedom to go start something

374
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:48,311
new and to eliminate the retailers so I
could go build a business platform

375
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,360
specifically.

376
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,210
So I could go out,
take these amazing materials,

377
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,230
amazing designs to mark that I couldn't
do before and get them to market through

378
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,630
this brand Kuya which has made all the
difference.

379
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,140
Well isn't it interesting that this has
all happened at the same time where the

380
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,580
Internet has kind of exploded in this
way that people are doing perfect time,

381
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,570
massive amount of shopping online's
yeah,

382
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,710
I mean I have a one of those uh,
mailboxes where they get your packages

383
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,200
for the company and uh,
you know,

384
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:19,190
when I used him 10 years ago,
I'd get like a package every couple days

385
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,740
or something like that.
Now every time I go there is stacks and

386
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:22,431
boxes.
Shit.

387
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,040
Cause I do like all my shopping online.
Everyone does now.

388
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,940
It's a crazy thing how that's happened
for you guys,

389
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:32,840
like right as your company started was
right at the same time.

390
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,270
It's like you caught that wave right at
the crest.

391
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,160
When I look back it's like we
orchestrated it and timed it perfect and

392
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:43,610
like we could see the future.
I could see the downfall it he called

393
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,171
it,
I mean Brennan,

394
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:47,000
I talked about it.
I can see there's a problem with retail

395
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,540
when you can't produce the best products
possible for your customers because they

396
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,670
can't sell it.
They can't have the value any longer

397
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,980
because all zur offering is price and
selection.

398
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:59,240
So price wins in a see a selection with
no one there to explain why a new

399
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,860
product so much better than the old
product.

400
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,420
There's a problem and I saw it coming
and now you see it,

401
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,240
you know,
getting exacerbated everyday with new

402
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,450
reports about retailers,
failing malls going out of business.

403
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,700
Retail is in big,
big trouble.

404
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,940
Amazons,
you know,

405
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,100
made that happen faster.

406
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,040
The Internet's made it happen and it's
all looking back with [inaudible].

407
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,680
Timing was everything.
I mean,

408
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,770
as you know with business,
you know a lot of it is timing luck and

409
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,260
be in the right place at the right time
with the right concepts and ideas.

410
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,170
And we,
we didn't totally nailed it and we kind

411
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:34,670
of came in at the exact same time with
on it that you guys did with [inaudible]

412
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,450
and with the same exact model,
selling directly to people getting the

413
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:42,050
very best shit you can possibly get.
What is the like forget about cost.

414
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,860
What is the best most imp?
Most nutrient dense foods?

415
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,130
Most nutrient dense supplements.
Let's figure out a way to get the best

416
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,040
stuff.
Find who's got the best protein powder?

417
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:54,560
Who's got the best?
Well it's cost prohibitive because of

418
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:56,230
this and the retail gets marked down.
Exactly.

419
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,230
That's the issue,
right?

420
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,840
Is like when you sell something to a
retailer,

421
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:04,841
like a Cabela's or something like that,
they tack on a bunch of money on him a

422
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,810
ton,
right?

423
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,960
Then make a lot more money than we did a
hundred percent so we've made money then

424
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,501
you guys,
no,

425
00:17:09,501 --> 00:17:11,510
no.
I mean they tack on a hundred percent or

426
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,160
percent.
So a jacket I had produced for a hundred

427
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:16,490
I'd sell the Kybella is for 200 they
sell to you for 400 bucks.

428
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,820
Wow.
For putting on a coat hanger and thrown

429
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,950
it on a rack makes it convenient.
You know,

430
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,100
if you're like in a place and you need a
jacket and you left your jacket at home,

431
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,590
but it's,
it's a faulty model.

432
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,140
It doesn't make sense.
If you're a guy like you that does

433
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:34,220
research and knows exactly what he wants
and you can put a tape measure on

434
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,630
yourself and know how big you are.
I mean,

435
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:40,631
I'm roughly an xl and you could save
yourself money and get a better product.

436
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,310
It's a no brainer.
We'll also,

437
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,760
the amount of research that you can do,
like if you go to a store and you talked

438
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,010
to the guy that's behind the counter,
what do you know?

439
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,250
Times I've talked to people

440
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,410
like,
do you go to a place that sells car

441
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,720
parts or something like that and you
ask,

442
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,670
you got a question and he says something
that's totally wrong.

443
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:57,180
You're like,
well,

444
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,180
I know that's not right,
but if you don't know that and how the

445
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:01,840
fuck,
do you know where this goes or,

446
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,680
yeah.
I mean you have to be someone who's like

447
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:06,930
deeply,
deeply involved in the product to be

448
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,300
able to explain it to someone who
becomes obsessed.

449
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,770
Exactly.
Like if someone has like,

450
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,200
like your packs,
the way you guys engineer the carbon

451
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,230
frame your packs.
Like I spent like fucking hour and a

452
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,900
half the other night watching videos of
how you guys make pacts and Nicole.

453
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,940
Yeah.
The first thing he said right off the

454
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:23,340
bat is like,
we're going to pull the curtain back.

455
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm going to tell everybody what
everybody has been afraid to tell

456
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:27,470
everybody.
I'm,

457
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,240
if,
if you educate the person to know what

458
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,520
they're looking at and you're building
the best stuff,

459
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,980
they'll end up back here and so he's
just like,

460
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,710
no one had ever said,
here's what fabrics we're using.

461
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,420
Here's where we're getting it.
Here's where our factory,

462
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,980
here's what we're doing.
I mean like competitors,

463
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,380
like are people going to seal it?
I don't care.

464
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,060
You build the best stuff and you sell it
at a good value for what you have to and

465
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,300
man.

466
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,030
Yeah.
So the whole transparency thing has been

467
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,990
incredible to watch and be in direct
where you can communicate directly with

468
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:59,040
your customers as you know,
it's so fricking powerful and they love

469
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,010
it and we're able to build so much
trust.

470
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,090
I mean,
we started,

471
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,970
I started blogging about Ku.
You 18 months before ever launched.

472
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,860
I talked about the fabrics and
materials,

473
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,050
a factories,
the process of building a company.

474
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,940
And I really did it just to keep my name
associated with the next brand.

475
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,100
As I left and transitioned out of the
Sitka,

476
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,640
I had no idea what it would create.
And it created this massive following.

477
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:23,700
People started engaging with me and
asking me questions and I was,

478
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,610
uh,
listen to their suggestions on products

479
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:30,480
and educated them on what great fabrics,
what great design was,

480
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:34,950
and they just ate it up and the consumer
loves it.

481
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,290
The retailer wasn't given it to them any
longer.

482
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,940
You know what,
back in the day,

483
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,800
I used to,
I grew up working at an archery shop in

484
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,110
orange,
California from Bob Fromm is really,

485
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,080
really amazing archery shop owner.
And he was the guy,

486
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,340
right?
I mean you walked in and said,

487
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:48,031
Bob,
what's the latest,

488
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:49,980
greatest stuff?
And he can tell you all about it.

489
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,310
You go to Cabela's now,
like you were saying,

490
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,000
the guy on the floor has no clue.
The customer knows more than the,

491
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,430
than the retailer now.
And you know,

492
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,060
by taking with cu,
you would go on directly that customer,

493
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:05,820
giving them all that information,
giving them the power to make the

494
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:08,580
decision,
they ate it up and then bail to be

495
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,520
involved them through this process.
You know,

496
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,650
they uh,
they just build a ton of trust with you.

497
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:15,420
It's like they understand,
they understand the brand,

498
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,250
they understand you,
they understand how you think and why

499
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,590
you're making those decisions.
And then they trust you.

500
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
And once you have the consumers trust
and you don't break it,

501
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,570
you know,
you can really build a brand off of

502
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:25,160
that.
Now.

503
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,020
Well,
a guy like me who loves to geek out on

504
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,240
shit too,
totally obsessed with things.

505
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,170
That's what I love,
that I can go and watch all these videos

506
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,650
and read all this stuff about all the
different engineering that's involved in

507
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,620
creating a product.
And when I do that,

508
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,240
it gets people more excited.
That's why I think it's a brilliant move

509
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,820
to blog about it in between the time of
building the company,

510
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,750
it was,
I mean I look back now and it's like

511
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,890
ahead of blueprint on how to a company
today.

512
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:51,130
When we did that,
I look back and read the blog posts and

513
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,660
I looked and I just go,
wow,

514
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:55,270
I can't believe I actually did that
without really knowing I was doing.

515
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,130
Cause it seems like an execute it so
perfectly.

516
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,440
And I was just following my gut and
interacting with,

517
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,390
with the customers.
And it was,

518
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,210
it was so,
so powerful and such a big thing because

519
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,110
as I built this business model,
which is the first of its kind in this

520
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:11,110
industry,
and even the outdoor market people told

521
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:12,250
me,
cool idea,

522
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:15,820
but how are they going to find you?
How are they trust you to buy your

523
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:17,800
product to begin with?
How are you going to get customers

524
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,430
before soon enough before so you don't
go a business and run out of money?

525
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,500
Because so many companies will go create
a website launch and no one knows about

526
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:27,120
it,
right?

527
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,810
Well how do you,
how do you create that interest in

528
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,140
advance?
Um,

529
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,080
and create the demand?
We can spend a ton of money.

530
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,430
You look at like a warby parker or a
hairy shave or dollar shave club,

531
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:40,690
will they spend more money than they're
bringing in and they're burning cash?

532
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:44,890
Like it's going out of style to create
demand through high levels of marketing

533
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:46,030
that's very,
very expensive.

534
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:48,330
Or you can do it like we didn't educate
the customer and,

535
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,670
and be transparent,
build trust in advance and then launch.

536
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,460
And then you've got your best sales
force in the world,

537
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,980
which is your customer base because they
don't understand everything about your

538
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,200
brand.
You guys have this advantage in that

539
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,680
hunting w because it's such a difficult
pursuit because it's sort of gets in

540
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:04,990
your DNA,
you become obsessed with it.

541
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,230
And when you become obsessed with it and
you find a company that's also obsessed

542
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:09,940
with making the very best shape
possible,

543
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,510
and then you guys geek out to such a
high level on the videos and on the

544
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,400
these descriptions of what you're
making,

545
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,150
then then these obsessed people become
obsessed with what you're doing.

546
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:19,691
And they go,
oh,

547
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:21,790
well if I'm going to do this right,
I got to do this this way.

548
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,500
They do.
And uh,

549
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,860
it,
and it's great.

550
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:28,570
I mean,
people we meet and hunters we meet in

551
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,820
or,
or a hunting camp or traveling.

552
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,640
I mean they,
it's amazing to me how much they know

553
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:36,010
about a product and how much to know
about the brand.

554
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,690
I mean they are,
like you said,

555
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:42,280
they geek out on it and eat all the
little details up and which I love

556
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,820
because that's what I geek out on when
I'm searching for these amazing fabrics

557
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:47,530
and learning about new technologies and
they share it.

558
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,600
These people eat it up,
they love it.

559
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,840
Well it's really a,
a sort of a master class in how to do

560
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:57,190
things the right way to foul passion and
being obsessed with something but doing

561
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:00,010
it to the utmost.
Because if you do that then the word

562
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,150
gets out,
the word gets out,

563
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,950
people talk about it.
And like I said,

564
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:04,960
I found out about you guys through word
of mouth completely.

565
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,040
Well if you're actually doing it too,
I mean like the customers really see

566
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:09,581
that,
you know,

567
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:12,790
like you know,
no one else that's running a company.

568
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,510
This,
I mean,

569
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,580
you know,
multiple haunts every year.

570
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,910
Big study like believes in what he,
what,

571
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,600
what we're building and takes it to the
places that the are at.

572
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,290
Worst place our customers could ever go
and use it and people respect that they

573
00:23:26,291 --> 00:23:27,170
love,
they don't like that.

574
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,410
Not only that,
that's what I wanna do,

575
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,800
but I know that,
you know,

576
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,140
he's already,
he's done it to we,

577
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:32,501
you know,
we've,

578
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,120
we've used that stuff in those places.

579
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,490
What was it your blog that I read,
which,

580
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:40,480
which blog was it where you guys were
sucking water out of the top of a rock?

581
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,760
It was one of the blogs for your
company.

582
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:46,070
One of the early on blogs you guys went
on a hunt and uh,

583
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,530
you,
you were just talking in depth about all

584
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,580
the different,
I don't know who,

585
00:23:49,581 --> 00:23:51,090
who was a wrote it,
but it was all cool.

586
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:53,510
You stuff.
We were talking in depth about testing

587
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:56,600
out the products on these like really
remote back country hunts.

588
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,411
Yup.
Yeah.

589
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:00,380
I mean that's how we figured out the
shortcomings of our product.

590
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,060
You can look at all the laboratory data,
you can look at all the test results of,

591
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,870
of what that's getting back to you,
but you really don't know until you put

592
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:12,230
it in the conditions that we put it in.
And we've like Toray who is my main

593
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,160
fabric supplier.

594
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,430
This is the most innovative jap.
I mean they are the,

595
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,430
the bomb as far as technical fabrics go
and it's,

596
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:23,270
is Japanese the Japanese by culture
build the best fabrics in the world?

597
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,280
What do they,
what are they putting in them?

598
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,260
Cause like you guys use a lot of
synthetics,

599
00:24:27,261 --> 00:24:28,100
right?
They do.

600
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:31,310
I mean they're,
so their quality standards in Japan are

601
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:35,450
much higher than anywhere else in the
world and they have a really high

602
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:38,930
quality standard of the raw material.
Then they have a really high quality

603
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:43,670
standard of the actual yarn and then
they've figured out how to make their

604
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:45,800
yard stretch and recover with no
elastic.

605
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:49,820
It's why our stuff so light.
But because of that process and because

606
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,860
of their high quality standards are
incredibly expensive.

607
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,530
Um,
but the Japanese just by their,

608
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,870
their,
their nature and their culture,

609
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,390
they don't do things that cut corners.

610
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,960
You look at the building of a Samurai
sword is a great example.

611
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,570
There is a lot easier ways to build a
sword that a Samurai does.

612
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,030
The Samurai sword is built.
I mean it takes a lot of time.

613
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,810
A lot of patients and it's perfect.
I got one over there from 15,

614
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,550
11.
So you know it right?

615
00:25:13,551 --> 00:25:14,920
Yeah,
that one sitting on the jam.

616
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,390
Real one.
It's the way the Japanese do things and

617
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,630
it's the same way of why they produce
such amazing fabrics and materials and

618
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:23,300
they're continuously pushing the bar as
far as innovation,

619
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,220
reducing weight.
And it's a partner for us.

620
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:28,570
That's just amazing.
I found Toray well before I started q

621
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,830
you I couldn't,
I tried to build a Tory product line

622
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,050
with Sitka and it was just price
prohibitive.

623
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,340
I took it to a couple of buyers at
Cabela's,

624
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,670
um,
when at shields sports and they said

625
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:39,350
beautiful way too expensive.

626
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,800
So what are they doing to make this
stuff so light?

627
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:47,270
And like it stretches a little bit in it
and it snaps back,

628
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,970
but it's very light.
And so they have a patent on how they

629
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:53,330
make the yard is called Pram flex yarn.
And if you look under a microscope,

630
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,400
it looks like a spring.
Right?

631
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,880
And so it can stretch out and then
recover without any elastic.

632
00:25:58,881 --> 00:26:02,900
Everybody else has to put spandex or
elastic or Lycra in their fabrics and

633
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,980
lastic super heavy.
It holds moisture and it's also,

634
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,480
you know,
with stretches and doesn't really

635
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,680
recover until you wash it.
Again.

636
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,810
If you were a PA,
a stretch pair of pants with a lot of

637
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,850
lasted,
they can kind of saggy after a period of

638
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,700
time.
You notice with ours they'll fit the

639
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,390
exact same way on day 10 as they did on
day one because of their fabric,

640
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,940
because of how they make the year on the
stretches recover that last.

641
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,780
So why are they making this fabric too?
This is like who are these crazy people

642
00:26:26,781 --> 00:26:29,780
that are out there like super
engineering fabric,

643
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,590
so Japanese and they'll sell it into
Japanese market.

644
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,620
They'll pay for performance,
their pricing on their performance.

645
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:40,040
Apparel is much higher in Japan,
the European market as well for their

646
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,280
climbing industry.
And some of the ski brands run their,

647
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,910
their uh,
fabrics as well.

648
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,530
Um,
but it's,

649
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:49,740
nobody's really introduced their product
line like we have the United States

650
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,240
cause it's been cost prohibitive to up
and Teleco,

651
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,310
you business model came out.
So they just decided to essentially the

652
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:59,730
same thing that you guys are doing.
Just figure out what is the best way to

653
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:00,900
do this.
It's how they do it.

654
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,440
Yeah.
And there I am,

655
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,330
Tory has ended or as a company,
as a Japanese conglomerate,

656
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,610
which is pretty typical of Japanese
companies and their,

657
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,640
their base,
there's the start of their company was

658
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,360
chemistry.

659
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
So there are chemistry based company
that makes chemicals and make carbon

660
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:18,720
fiber,
but it's chemistry that starts of with

661
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:23,750
everything they do and understanding how
everything is produced and made and it's

662
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:27,510
that foundation allows them to,
to put out these amazing innovations to

663
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:30,180
figure out nanotechnology and how to
waterproof a down feather,

664
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,870
how to make membranes that brief two and
a half times that of Gortex and still

665
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:38,130
stretch and recover in a more durable,
it's that foundation of who Tory is,

666
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:42,720
is a chemistry company that allows them
to push these innovations out and then

667
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,340
you add in the Japanese culture of
perfection and making things correct and

668
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:51,060
having processes that continue to
produce high quality products and

669
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:55,470
materials over time.
And that's why Toray is so fricking

670
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,460
amazing.
I dork out over shit like,

671
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,050
oh it's so cool.
I just love when someone's trying to

672
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:05,490
figure out a way to engineer something
to the very finest edge they do.

673
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,950
And then what's great about them is
always pushing.

674
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,430
And so they're coming to us with new
fabric innovations,

675
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:16,431
new technologies and innovation and
we're able to find their limits because

676
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:18,000
of our customers and what they use it
for.

677
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,280
And I'm able to go back to their
engineers now cause I've developed a

678
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,460
really big relationship with them where
they are now their largest customer in

679
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:26,610
the world and worked directly with their
team and say,

680
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:30,300
hey guys,
your membrane works great except for

681
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,130
these certain situations.
For instance,

682
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:35,310
they go and they try to figure out how
to run it by that and they will.

683
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,080
Yeah,
I mean they'll commit themselves to

684
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:40,790
fixing issues that we'll find.
The laboratory tests say they shouldn't

685
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,420
ever fail and we'll find the limits of
it.

686
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,700
I mean,
not necessarily Brendan,

687
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,700
I,
but our guides,

688
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,800
they're spending 200 250 days of their
life every year in the mountains.

689
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,180
They'll come back and say,
hey,

690
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,840
guess what,
this happened in this situation as rare

691
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,850
but lets us go back to the,
their,

692
00:28:56,851 --> 00:28:58,800
their development team and say,
hey,

693
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,770
we found limits on this thing.
And there they listen and they go back

694
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:04,770
and try to re engineer it to figure out
how to push the bar further.

695
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:06,810
So those,
those failures don't have,

696
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,050
I was listening to on a podcast
recently,

697
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,110
we were talking about this new
engineering that you're doing on your

698
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:15,870
packs and how you're testing them.
So like when you,

699
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,900
when you have a new product,
we'll say if you create a new pack or

700
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:21,810
something like that and you,
before you bring it to market,

701
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,390
do you get it to guides?
Do you have them tested?

702
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:26,510
Do you test it yourself exclusively?
Yeah,

703
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,510
so it starts as a process in house and
we'll put it through a certain tests

704
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,410
depending on the product.

705
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,070
Like the pack new pack frame we just
introduced today earlier.

706
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:35,940
It could you live,
I don't know if he just happened to see

707
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,920
my live presentation for now.
Flight down here.

708
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,190
Um,
so you,

709
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,220
you do a live presentation like a
product and you did that today.

710
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,050
Yeah.
Kind of like a keynote thing like jobs

711
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:45,340
does.
That's hilarious.

712
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,500
I was doing that with hunting.
Nobody,

713
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,770
you guys are savages not doing them.
I'm excited about this.

714
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,720
Not It,
not doing it well.

715
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,170
So you,
you,

716
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,660
you have this product launch and um,
so what did you,

717
00:29:58,661 --> 00:29:59,680
what did you launch?
What is it?

718
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,840
Well,
we introduced a new carbon fiber

719
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,270
technology that just came out on the
market a couple of years ago.

720
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,530
Introduced as far as ability to start
developing product with a new fiber

721
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:10,540
technology called spread tow carbon
fiber.

722
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,760
You'll love this because you keep you
out and stuff like this.

723
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,860
So carbon fiber,
traditionally the fibers are putting the

724
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,770
yarn,
right?

725
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,840
So they take each individual carbon
fiber,

726
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,650
group them together and make a yarn.
Those yarns are then woven into fabric.

727
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,290
It's what you see of typical carbon
fiber look,

728
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,220
right?
The woven,

729
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,710
uh,
the web and look you see on carbon fiber

730
00:30:29,711 --> 00:30:32,200
what spread toe is instead of round
fibers.

731
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:34,510
They've figured out that if you flatten
the fibers out,

732
00:30:34,511 --> 00:30:37,900
so instead of being round,
they're flat and instead of weaving

733
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:39,970
them,
they lay them next to each other and

734
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,240
then so they run so lines across it,
which you can see in our new frame.

735
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,190
And by doing so when you mold it into a
product,

736
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,140
because that fiber is now completely
flat and it's running the length of the,

737
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,560
of the product,
it's much stiffer and stronger than if

738
00:30:56,561 --> 00:31:01,390
you weave it in a has the fiber has to
go up and over other fibers is not as

739
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,340
stiff,
not as strong in the performance level.

740
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,910
You give up quite a bit compared to
spread to spread toes,

741
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:10,300
all directional fibers.
And then what we've done in our frame is

742
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:14,890
we now can determine exactly how many
fibers run from the top of the frame to

743
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,630
the bottom of the frame.
And then we,

744
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,850
the fibers of course,
and then lay in on a 45 how much

745
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:27,040
stiffness we want and flex we want on
the horizontal axis.

746
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,410
So do you want our packs?
You'll,

747
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,130
you'll notice that it carries a load
really well because the vertical

748
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:34,870
stiffness,
but it's also comfortable like an

749
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:39,640
internal pack because of how much fiber
we have running on the horizontal access

750
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:42,490
that controls that flex.
So you want to have a certain amount of

751
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:43,660
flex?
Yes.

752
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,420
Have to.
But you got to figure out what that

753
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,460
amount is.
And the way to figure that out is by

754
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:51,250
testing.
We went through 18 versions of our frame

755
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,400
to get to where the formula is that we
now and re reintroduce today.

756
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,320
That's fucking hilarious.
Who does that?

757
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,710
I do work fiber engineers and with our
development team,

758
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:03,310
Sean and in our office does,
is there any other companies is going

759
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:06,760
through 18 different versions of a
carbon fiber frame in order to figure

760
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,260
the only one in the world that produces
one.

761
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:12,070
So it's probably just us.
I've got a patent on our frame design.

762
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,210
I know what carbon fiber is,
but I don't know what carbon fiber is.

763
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,700
You know what I'm saying?
Like my car has,

764
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,770
oh look at this Jamie.
Yeah.

765
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,630
On the ball to killing it.
Jamie's always on the ball.

766
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,250
Um,
so it's a cloth.

767
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,290
I mean it's soft,
it's pliable.

768
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,340
Um,
how does it,

769
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:32,020
because I have a porsche nine 11 gt,
three Rs that has a carbon fiber rear

770
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:33,400
wing.
And I'm also like,

771
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,230
it looks bad ass,
but what the fuck is that?

772
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,740
Stay down as a fiber and then you put it
to clock in it.

773
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,250
And that's what connects.
So the epoxy,

774
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,950
so it starts out as a co,
a carbon cloth.

775
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,420
It is pure cloth.
You could feel it,

776
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,930
flexes moves just like the cloth and
okay,

777
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,120
here it is.
This is what it looks as at fabric.

778
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,600
So that spread toe there in a
bi-directional format.

779
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,820
And then from there you turn that
somehow or another into this really hard

780
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:03,821
stuff with a heat activated resin.
So you saw,

781
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,710
if you go back to the mold with a frame
where lane in there,

782
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,180
um,
right there.

783
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,350
So we're laying that into a,
into a mold.

784
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:13,880
So we have a bottom molds,
aluminum cut and a top mold.

785
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:17,150
And we laid that fiber in and the way
he's doing is applying the resin.

786
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,580
And then we'll put the top mold on top.

787
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,900
And then we add a ton of pressure for
you.

788
00:33:21,901 --> 00:33:25,730
How many thousands of pounds of pressure
gets put on top of it and add heat and

789
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:29,390
time and over.
I think it takes in that little over an

790
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,500
hour,
we will cure that mold or that that

791
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,770
resin into a actual part.
And that becomes our frame.

792
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:42,460
And one is the advantage of that over
like say any other very stiff or durable

793
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,110
material.
It's half the weight of aluminum.

794
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,730
It's twice as strong as steel and then
by twice as strongest deal.

795
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,960
It is amazing.
It's amazing material and one and then

796
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:58,340
also how we engineer the mold.
And a big part of the engineering

797
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:02,600
process of this is understanding how far
apart you separate the fibers create

798
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:06,230
stiffness.
So we have foam in between the carbon

799
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:09,410
fibers and them center portion of the
frame that that full uh,

800
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,110
that phone crates and what what they
called modulates,

801
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,540
which is a separation of the fibers.

802
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,450
And that modulates,
creates the overall stiffness within the

803
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:21,050
center portion of our frame.
And then how much of that we have within

804
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,270
the frame determines how much flex
stiffness.

805
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,150
And then also where we're putting the
fibers and how many,

806
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,040
so there's a lot to it.
The weak point of carbon is the epoxy,

807
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,450
the carbons,
the strongest part.

808
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:35,610
And so the new spread toe,
what it does is it,

809
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,400
it makes it tighter.
Smaller,

810
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,390
yeah.
Less.

811
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,590
Less epoxy.
Yep.

812
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,220
And so when we got out spread toe,
which who does introduced for no weight

813
00:34:43,221 --> 00:34:45,020
penalty,
we now have a frame that's five times

814
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:47,180
different,
stronger than what we had previous,

815
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,920
which is still a really good performing
product and we just got five times

816
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,000
better.
That's insane,

817
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,240
isn't it?
And so when,

818
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,840
when you say five times different,
stronger,

819
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,840
how do you know,
is there a too stiff or is it not a

820
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:00,530
stiffness issue?

821
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,890
It's a flex issue.
Is there,

822
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,110
there,
is there a difference here?

823
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,410
I mean there is and it's a challenge,
right?

824
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:09,980
It's finding that perfect balance and
you can do that with carbon.

825
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:14,240
You can't do that with a steel or
aluminum frame pack and you really can't

826
00:35:14,241 --> 00:35:16,910
do that with any other pack frame
design,

827
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:20,990
which is usually some sort of plastic
sheeting with aluminum stays put in.

828
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,300
The flex is kind of there,
you can add more lumens stays,

829
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:28,080
but then still is an aluminum stay.
It's the people who listen to this and

830
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,620
understand what's aluminum bar
essentially.

831
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,730
And you can kind of mold in a curve or
whatever and it's sewn to a piece of

832
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,410
plastic,
shoved down the back part of it.

833
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:38,100
Like an internal frame backpack

834
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,250
has some sort of support,
stiffness,

835
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,450
stiffness,
rigidity.

836
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,200
It's what will pull the weight off
somebody's shoulders that it will help

837
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,260
carry that load versus just a Duffel bag
strapped to your back,

838
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,300
which is uncomfortable as you know.
Well that's where the,

839
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:52,740
the,
the interesting aspect of the

840
00:35:52,741 --> 00:35:54,780
engineering comes in when it comes to
packs because,

841
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,210
uh,
the same weight with a different pack

842
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,920
feels different.
Totally different.

843
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,050
And that's something that I think a lot
of people are not aware of.

844
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:01,920
Like you think,
oh,

845
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,270
she carrying a hundred pounds on your
back.

846
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,500
You're carrying a hundred pounds on your
back.

847
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,610
No,
no,

848
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,211
no.
It's,

849
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,670
it's depended entirely upon the
ergonomics,

850
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:10,500
how it sets on your body.
It does.

851
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,930
And geometry of how that loads
transferred onto your back and the

852
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:13,541
frame.
And,

853
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:15,780
and balancing it.
There's a lot to it.

854
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,880
And you know,
in the past,

855
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:22,290
before our frame came to market,
you either had really stiff frames with

856
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
external frame packs and metal or
aluminum.

857
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:28,490
And then you have this internal frame
which was really comfortable until you

858
00:36:28,491 --> 00:36:31,200
had put weight in it and then it would
wouldn't be stiff Neth and it would end

859
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:34,680
up putting a lot of pressure and weight
on your shoulders and your hips.

860
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,590
So how,
how do you engineer that?

861
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:40,140
Do you have to try it out?
Do you have to like take one of these

862
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:42,690
packs and,
and wear it on a long back country hunt

863
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:43,201
and they say,
okay,

864
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,180
here's some,
I got a little bit too much weight on my

865
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:46,890
shoulder,
a little bit too much weight on my hip

866
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:49,440
or how do you,
how do you discern?

867
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,790
That's essentially that I do a lot of
workouts with weight on my back and a

868
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,500
pack on a treadmill.
Um,

869
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:57,930
so I'm able,
I'd spend a ton of time in our packs

870
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,230
with various weights and we do that.

871
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,870
Um,
a lot of guys in our office do as well

872
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:05,250
as,
as well as my uh,

873
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,530
my pack developer,
Shawn and Brendan.

874
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,330
And then we,
once we feel like we're really close,

875
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:14,331
we then ship them out to Brendan's guys
a bunch of guides and say test it for

876
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:17,160
us.
But through your world and what you're

877
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:18,930
using it for,
I mean one of the challenges we have

878
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:21,600
with our,
with our industry and backpacks is this

879
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:24,840
huge as you know,
this huge swing of weight.

880
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,480
Yeah.
Cause once we get something down we've

881
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,610
got to get all that out.
So we're going to go from maybe packing

882
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:33,030
them with 50 or 60 pound back to all
sudden now you've got 100 plus pound

883
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:36,300
load and need to manage that.
So how do you get a pack that can do

884
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,640
both,
be comfortable with lighter weights and

885
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:41,160
still have the ability to carry heavy
weights?

886
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,940
It's an engineering problem and it's
also an engineering problem that's

887
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:48,870
handled to a bunch of different ways.
Like some people pack it inside the bag,

888
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:51,540
some people the,
the pack separates from the frame.

889
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:54,270
You pack the meat to your body.
And then put the pack,

890
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,910
the rest of the pack,
strap that down on top of the frame.

891
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,810
How do you decide how to handle that?
Just trial and error as well.

892
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,080
You want the weight closest to your
back,

893
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:05,970
you can get the better it is and it is
the closest you can get it like flatter

894
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:08,130
to your back as well.
Like you don't,

895
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,260
you don't want it like bulging out,
right?

896
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,930
Like if you have a large,
yeah.

897
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,230
If you have a hundred pounds and it's
sitting in a two foot square,

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,470
the lower part of your back that's not
nearly as good as like flattened out to

899
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,560
six inches and going over the entire
section,

900
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,300
you're going to spread that out,
up and down the frame as close to the

901
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,550
frame of your back as possible.
And how,

902
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,410
where do you,
where do you make it sit on your

903
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:30,930
shoulders?
How are you strapping it in to make sure

904
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:34,140
that it's in the right place or you want
to carry the majority of the route with

905
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:35,530
your hips?
So,

906
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,250
I mean you

907
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,700
start at the waist to put it all in and
then shoulder straps,

908
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:41,410
all that kind of stuff and stand up and
then your,

909
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,450
your load lifters and all the way up.
But I mean you want it,

910
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,270
I mean it's individual thing,
how how it fits.

911
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:48,610
But you want to start with,
I mean your hips or your strongest,

912
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,690
your center of gravity,
that's,

913
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,240
that's where you want the majority of
the weight to be carried as close as you

914
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,040
can.
And this is all trial and error stuff

915
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,590
that's been done through mountaineering.
Throw these different guys that are

916
00:38:56,591 --> 00:39:00,010
going on these long backpack hikes.
Yeah it is.

917
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,360
And then it's,
it's fit.

918
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,820
And also,
I mean it's critical that you have the

919
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,750
pack that fits correctly.
Most people have a pack that isn't set

920
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:11,290
up correct.
And we found that with our pacs are

921
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,200
really easy to adjust shoulder straps so
we can get a perfect fit for each

922
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:14,620
customer.

923
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,610
And we put an instructional video out
there of making sure the geometry from

924
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:21,790
your load lifters,
which are the straps that come off the

925
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,700
top of the pack down to your shoulder
straps that geometry has to,

926
00:39:24,701 --> 00:39:28,330
is critical that it's perfect and it has
to be at a 45 degree angle that will

927
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:31,780
help take that load off your shoulders
and transfer to your hips and help you

928
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:33,850
manage that weight comfortably over a
long period of time.

929
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,690
So you need like geometry,
you need like you need like a triangle

930
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,420
set up to make sure it's where this is
where the whole bubble thing doesn't

931
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:42,340
come in real life.
Exactly.

932
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:45,850
That's why there's a lot,
I mean it starts at mathematics with the

933
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:50,851
frame and designs and cad and CNC
machines and all that and the math and

934
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:53,440
all through it.
And then it goes all the way through and

935
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:54,680
you build it and then all of a sudden,
you know,

936
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:56,170
it's,
and then it requires testing and,

937
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,700
and,
and taking it,

938
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,570
you know,
in real life settings and,

939
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,570
and,
and people vary on what they like.

940
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,450
I mean there's some guys like to carry
see things a certain way.

941
00:40:04,451 --> 00:40:06,040
Some people like fit,
you know,

942
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,990
some guys like their pack way up high.
I've,

943
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:11,470
I've fitted guys that like him.
I mean you can only know by,

944
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,090
by,
by testing it,

945
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:16,750
by doing it,
by carrying some weight and how many

946
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:20,290
different products are you individually
overseeing and c.

947
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:20,931
Dot.
Is that,

948
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:24,190
that's the most daunting aspect of it
because you've got all this different

949
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:28,210
shit going on at the same time.
And on top of that you're doing a dozen

950
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,230
hunts a year plus and you're,
you're,

951
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,890
you're out there in the field.
Like how the fuck do you find the time

952
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:33,840
to do all this?
Well,

953
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,410
you know,
it's interesting when you,

954
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:38,160
when you do something you love and you
have a huge passion for it.

955
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,480
I never stopped working.
I mean I work second,

956
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,130
I get up in the morning until the time I
go to bed.

957
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,560
If I'm not sitting in front of my
computer working on stuff specific for q

958
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:47,380
you,
I'm thinking about it and that's,

959
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,860
it doesn't feel like it's a lot of work.
Although I look back now and go,

960
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,420
fuck,
it has a lot of work.

961
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,140
We found some amazing products.
Um,

962
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,760
and you know,
it's just,

963
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:01,360
it's a process and it's solving problems
through finding materials and

964
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:03,400
technologies and the designs it solve
those problems.

965
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:07,180
There's a lot to be solved and hunting.
Fortunately it was a big gap from afar.

966
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,630
Brendan pull that sucker up,
close a big gap from,

967
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,460
you know,
some of the other industries are out

968
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:14,170
there before Sitka and could use come
along.

969
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,740
So there was a lot of work to do and
we've done a lot to take from where

970
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:22,720
hunting apparel and gear was back in
2004 to where it is today in 2016 is a

971
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:26,740
massive change.
And not everything's as in depth as the

972
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,390
pack all the way from start to finish.
I mean,

973
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,270
sometimes you have great fit on
something and you have a new fabric.

974
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:31,840
Well,
you know,

975
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,740
I mean how it,
it's got to get tested.

976
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,010
You got to

977
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,010
see how you like it.
But it's not like 18 models of,

978
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:38,990
you know,
when you get a superior breathing,

979
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,290
you know,
some,

980
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,380
you know,
it's not all as in depth as added to.

981
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:49,340
It's a lot of it's plugging in the right
product to the right fit and then you

982
00:41:49,341 --> 00:41:50,810
have,
you have a winner right off the bat.

983
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,900
Well I think,
uh,

984
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,690
what you were saying about the amount of
work,

985
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,140
this is also like how we were saying
that hunting isn't really a sport.

986
00:41:57,141 --> 00:41:59,930
Like it gets called a sport.
It's sort of its own thing.

987
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,170
Work is sort of its own thing too
because you can call it,

988
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,720
you can call it work,
but if you love something,

989
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,280
it's not really work.
Like showing up at the garbage depo and,

990
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,550
or the garbage dump and picking up cans,
garbage.

991
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,850
I guess you could love garbage.
There's some,

992
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,700
yeah,
some guy out there screaming

993
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,580
kill it and garbage.

994
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

995
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,710
When you find something that you become
obsessed with,

996
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,380
that becomes a passion.
It's like it's a puzzle.

997
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:30,930
It's,
it's,

998
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,560
it's just like you're doing it again,
a game all day,

999
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:36,560
almost there.
And it's also in a lot of ways in art

1000
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:41,240
forum did I tell you what brand building
to be as fascinating and it is an art

1001
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:43,700
form and there's no science,
there's no blueprint.

1002
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,840
This is how you build this brand and I
think it's the most fascinating work

1003
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:51,170
I've ever done.
It's truly figuring out a craft brand

1004
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:53,810
building is a craft well and never
stops.

1005
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,280
You never stop learning from it every
day.

1006
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,630
I mean you live it and breathe it every
day.

1007
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,220
Yeah,
it reflects you guys.

1008
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,890
I mean that's one of the things that
I've found interesting about this.

1009
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:04,430
It's like you can kind of see when
there's someone like you that's at the

1010
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:08,270
head of something like this and you're
this driven focus guy,

1011
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,000
you kind of see that when you,
when you see the,

1012
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:12,500
the,
the actual brand itself,

1013
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,090
it reflects you.

1014
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,320
So this idea of like it being work,
it's really like a passion project.

1015
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,760
It is.
It truly is.

1016
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,300
Everything from the product to the brand
building to the videos,

1017
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:24,230
to the imagery.
I mean,

1018
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:29,231
I've got my hands in everything and I'm
super particular about the way our image

1019
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,340
is presented to the marketplace.
It's got to have it.

1020
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,050
I can feel,
I always tell people I can,

1021
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,970
I can feel it,
I can taste it,

1022
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:37,280
I can smell it.
Everything was cool.

1023
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:41,720
Well that's a one of the beautiful
things about having a very small center

1024
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:45,890
of operation.
Like you guys deciding how this goes

1025
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,660
down.
You don't have to meet with a giant

1026
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,010
board of,
you know,

1027
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:51,110
a bunch of different people.
You're not a public company.

1028
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,280
You don't,
you don't have to,

1029
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,740
there's nobody there to water down the
cheerios.

1030
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,110
Does that mean that it's not a democracy
down the cheerios?

1031
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,440
I always say everyday it's a
dictatorship.

1032
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:01,761
Yeah.
You know,

1033
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:05,420
it Kinda is and it works well that way.
And you know,

1034
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:06,740
it's interesting cause we get,
you know,

1035
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,660
we've,
because of our growth and because of our

1036
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:09,720
business model,
we have,

1037
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,060
we approached all the time by private
equity of estimate groups throwing huge

1038
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:15,740
valuations of money at me.
And I'm just,

1039
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,990
uh,
just when I look at the opportunity,

1040
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:18,860
yeah,
it's a lot of money.

1041
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:21,050
But I don't want to change what we've
got.

1042
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,100
Right.
You know,

1043
00:44:22,101 --> 00:44:25,370
as soon as I bring in outside capital or
profession professionals and look in the

1044
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,204
business,
they're like,

1045
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,470
well,
you need to professionalize.

1046
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,600
Like for who?
Right?

1047
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,180
What does that mean?
What does professional my

1048
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:32,941
team,
right,

1049
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:33,751
exactly.
Well,

1050
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:35,490
you need a CFO.
You need a cmo.

1051
00:44:35,491 --> 00:44:36,420
You need to see,
oh,

1052
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,860
I'm like for,
for what?

1053
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,680
Right?
So we can slow down our process so we

1054
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,990
can change the culture.
That's built a really special,

1055
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:45,390
unique company.
Some bunch of other people give pieces

1056
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,020
of the pie away.
It's just such a broken traditional

1057
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:53,240
model as far as growing a business and
we're doing it just the opposite to,

1058
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:56,490
same thing with podcasting.
There's a broken model that's,

1059
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,780
there's a lot of podcasters today that
are joining in with these gigantic

1060
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,500
networks and they think that being a
part of a network is like being on NBC

1061
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,350
or being on CBS,
which it used to be a big deal back in

1062
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,820
the day.
Like if you were running,

1063
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:11,430
doing a play and NBC came along and
said,

1064
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,300
we want to turn that play into a sitcom.

1065
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,940
He be like,
we fucking made it.

1066
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:19,170
Yeah.
But now if you have a successful podcast

1067
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,310
and someone comes along and says,
Hey,

1068
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:22,740
we would love you to be a part of our
gigantic corporation.

1069
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:25,140
Like get the fuck Outta here.
We gotta run.

1070
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,480
We got to run away from these guys.
They're going to ruin everything.

1071
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,380
They can.
They will.

1072
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,310
They will.
They'll come in,

1073
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,380
they'll tell you what to do.
They'll tell you what you can't do.

1074
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,650
No more cussing,
no more cussing for short.

1075
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,700
You can't bounce around and you got to
pick your,

1076
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,220
you gotta pick your topics,
your you're way too spaced out.

1077
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:39,990
What is,
what is water down?

1078
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:43,050
The cheerio is even fucking mean it.
You certainly can't cover hunting.

1079
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah,
exactly.

1080
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:45,780
That's was way too excited about twice a
week.

1081
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,110
I mean,
I cam hangs on a Monday and you guys on

1082
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:49,944
this way,
it's,

1083
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,530
I just don't,
I don't think you should do anything

1084
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:53,700
other than what you want to do.

1085
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,930
I think if you could live the best life,
it's like what?

1086
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,860
What actually interests you?
What do you actually enjoy doing?

1087
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,960
We'll do that.
Is it possible all the time?

1088
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,830
No,
you're going to,

1089
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:03,750
there's some obligations you're going to
have to have.

1090
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,790
There's a such family stuff,
work stuff,

1091
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:06,870
business stuff.
There's stuff,

1092
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:10,530
stuff you have to deal with,
but do what you want to do the most that

1093
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:11,880
you can do it.
Absolutely.

1094
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:14,790
I always say,
if you can be an expert in something you

1095
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,250
love,
you can find a way to make a living in.

1096
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:18,720
I mean,
Brendan's a perfect example.

1097
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,990
He freaking loves hunting and he lives
and breathes it.

1098
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:24,090
Studies it.
Look where he is now.

1099
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,380
Well,
when I met Brendan,

1100
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:28,670
I met him this past weekend in Bozeman,
and one of the things that struck me is

1101
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,380
when you and I were talking,
you have this fucking crazy fire in your

1102
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:31,560
eyes.

1103
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,320
You're like,
I want it to be the guy that kills the

1104
00:46:34,321 --> 00:46:36,900
biggest bowl every year.
And when I killed one big bowl,

1105
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,520
I didn't want it to just be like,
oh,

1106
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,800
it was just a fluke.
When now you gotta be consistent.

1107
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,761
And I was like,
all right,

1108
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:43,500
this crazy motherfucker.
I see where he's at.

1109
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,520
And then when you told me that you had
this gigantic bull down in sneeze,

1110
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:49,920
which is a store on main street in
Bozeman,

1111
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,990
I went to the store just to see that
bowl.

1112
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:53,400
I was like,
we've got to stop it.

1113
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:54,720
And I gotta,
I gotta take a look at this thing.

1114
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:58,050
And this is elk that looks like
something out of the Lord of the rings

1115
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,150
that doesn't even look like a real
animal.

1116
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,200
It's breathtaking.
It's fucking mass,

1117
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:02,880
isn't it?
I mean,

1118
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,680
as you walk up to that thing and you
look at it and you literally stopped

1119
00:47:06,681 --> 00:47:09,900
shooting attracts explained the weight
of the antlers on that thing.

1120
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,600
So I mean,
that's obviously an unusually big,

1121
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:13,460
I mean,
most delk,

1122
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,620
given their whole lifespan,
we'll never achieve that.

1123
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:19,450
It's a truly special al can like,
and people like it.

1124
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,430
Not just a number,
but I mean it is a Shaquille o'neal of

1125
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:24,360
elk.
That's what it is.

1126
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,280
It's that rare and a,
yeah,

1127
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:28,980
the horn.
When when the skull plates sought off,

1128
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,220
we'd 54 pounds.

1129
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,870
She's a,
so it,

1130
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,740
which is to answer,
I mean it's,

1131
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:36,010
it's heavy and John like unusually big.
They're just,

1132
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:37,310
it just mass,
you know,

1133
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,850
it was the biggest sell killed in 30
years and stay state Montana.

1134
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,000
So it was neon.
Would it look like when it was alive?

1135
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:46,260
Right
away on the huffy thing,

1136
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,380
uh,
you know,

1137
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:51,250
a big bull elk will be six to 700
pounds.

1138
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,100
Mean they get thrown a thousand pounds a
lot.

1139
00:47:53,101 --> 00:47:53,690
But have,
you know,

1140
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:54,311
to wait,
I'm like,

1141
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:55,990
there are a few great big bowls at a
way.

1142
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,370
1,000.
It was a thousand pounder.

1143
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,320
He was 12 years old,
you know,

1144
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,210
he was a,
you're just a monster,

1145
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:02,190
you know.
So the,

1146
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:04,450
the Roosevelt elk,
so the ones that have the biggest

1147
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:05,284
bodies,
right.

1148
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,680
The Roosevelt elk have the,
by far the biggest bodies.

1149
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:09,310
Yeah.
But not,

1150
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,960
not the biggest,
not the biggest,

1151
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:11,880
not the biggest antlers.

1152
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,510
Like how big of their bodies get 1200.
It's a really big bulls.

1153
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:17,860
I mean,
you can see in photos of them,

1154
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:19,690
they're just enormous.
I mean,

1155
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,970
they are unusually giant.
I mean,

1156
00:48:21,971 --> 00:48:23,350
especially the really big bull,
you know,

1157
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,460
and a con,
you know,

1158
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:26,080
like not every elk is huge.
I mean,

1159
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:30,040
right.
An old bowl who's had good feed and

1160
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,650
lived a long time and was genetically
big to begin with,

1161
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,420
we'll be really big.
I mean they're not,

1162
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,040
they don't all end up huge,
you know,

1163
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,330
they're
just the ones he hunts.

1164
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,040
You have,
what's a fascinating pursuit,

1165
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,330
you know,
pursuing the,

1166
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:45,280
the,
the apex of the genetics,

1167
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,290
you know,
finding the animal.

1168
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:51,100
And it's also one of the things that's
important about this,

1169
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,750
like the pursuit of hunting is that this
animal that you shot was probably like

1170
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:56,950
me.
How old do you think he was?

1171
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,190
He was 12 years old and that is an old,
old l that is,

1172
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,250
that's old age in the world of wild
beasts.

1173
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,830
It's the ultimate,
I mean like when you get to the level

1174
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,530
where you're consistently killing stuff
and,

1175
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,710
and,
and you're,

1176
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,780
you know,
you've gotten to the point that the

1177
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,780
ultimate level is to kill the biggest,
oldest,

1178
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,460
most mature,
you know,

1179
00:49:15,461 --> 00:49:18,610
historically significant.
Went on that on a chain of events,

1180
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,430
in history of like,
all the guys I've ever killed elk mean,

1181
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,840
not ll card design are going to be huge.
But with any animals like when you kill

1182
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:28,480
something is super old,
super big,

1183
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,240
super smart.
That is the pinnacle of where your

1184
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:34,030
skills have gotten in,
in a lot of people never get there,

1185
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,051
you know,
based on,

1186
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:36,040
you know,
they don't have time.

1187
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,500
I mean the biggest,
the biggest factor in kill in doing that

1188
00:49:38,501 --> 00:49:40,270
and getting to that point is having the
time,

1189
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,760
you know,
just just having the time to,

1190
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,280
you know,
I spent a decade of my life putting a

1191
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:46,540
blue track everywhere.

1192
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,230
You could put one finding where every
alk was in my state and looking for the

1193
00:49:50,231 --> 00:49:51,930
biggest ones.
I mean it is like,

1194
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,890
like the work,
it's consuming you.

1195
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:56,950
You have to love to do it.
It's not fun.

1196
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:59,080
You would just have to be driven to do
it,

1197
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,030
to,
to want to want to be able to do it.

1198
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,810
But the result is fun.
I mean that the photo that you sent and

1199
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:08,200
he sent me some text messages,
photos of that thing on the ground.

1200
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,980
You see the size of the antlers?
No,

1201
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,820
that's another one.
That's another one he shot.

1202
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,220
Do you?
That's a pretty big one too.

1203
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,580
But that's not nearly as big as the one
you want me to send a t?

1204
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,430
Jamie,
I'll send it to you,

1205
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,620
Jamie.
Um,

1206
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,700
should I email it to you?
Either way.

1207
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,090
Okay.
Um,

1208
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,520
the,
and that was,

1209
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,541
you know,
at the,

1210
00:50:25,541 --> 00:50:28,070
at that point in time,
actually when I killed that elk,

1211
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:29,690
I wasn't at the skill set I am now.

1212
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,330
I mean,
I got pretty lucky that was a third El

1213
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:35,440
cobre killed right place the right time,
did the right thing and you know,

1214
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,610
just lit a fire in me.
Like I want to do that more.

1215
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,250
Yeah,
that's ridiculous that that was the

1216
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,670
third
first started talking to Brenda about

1217
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:46,730
hunting elk.
He would hunt elk and that was so

1218
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:47,600
different for me.
I mean,

1219
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:49,730
I was just trying to find a boulder
hunt,

1220
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,130
any bull,
and I would try to get a good one,

1221
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,030
but Brendan would hunt and find Anelka
and spend the entire season trying to

1222
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:57,650
kill that single up,
which I thought,

1223
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:00,410
at least my experience,
they'll kind of was fine.

1224
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,800
Hard to find that same aisle twice that
I'd maybe see in the morning and I would

1225
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:06,260
never see it again.
Britain had the ability to hunt it down

1226
00:51:06,261 --> 00:51:07,430
and kill it.
Well,

1227
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,670
it's also the best thing from a
conservation standpoint,

1228
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:15,140
you're talking about an animal that has
spread its genes for at least 10 years.

1229
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,400
Right.
For 10 years,

1230
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:19,960
that thing has been spreading those
superior genetics and it's probably been

1231
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,520
forced in a lot of other males to get
the fuck off the mountain.

1232
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,720
I mean,
when would me,

1233
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,970
yeah,
that one did.

1234
00:51:25,971 --> 00:51:29,300
I never saw,
I watched him for three days morning and

1235
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,660
night before I killed them and he knew
another bull never came near that thing.

1236
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,430
You have to beat Brock Lesner of elk
or Alistair overeem.

1237
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,463
Yeah,
exactly.

1238
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:42,410
When you're going to a old like ubering
old allister.

1239
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,300
Yeah,
allister still on the Mexican

1240
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:46,470
supplements.
Yeah.

1241
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,120
Yeah.
The new house,

1242
00:51:48,121 --> 00:51:49,400
there might be a better fighter.
Actually.

1243
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:50,610
It's interesting,
uh,

1244
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,060
when you see an animal like that and
you,

1245
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:53,841
you,
you,

1246
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:58,841
you realize how difficult it is to reach
12 years of age in the wild with

1247
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,440
mountain lions,
wolves.

1248
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:01,280
I mean,
Montana,

1249
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:03,770
it's like he's just got everything after
I'm grizzlies,

1250
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:04,640
everything's after him.

1251
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,910
And to be able to be that smart,
to get to this position in life and for

1252
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,900
you to solve that puzzle and to get in
and shoot that elk,

1253
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:17,480
that's,
that's one of the things that sort of

1254
00:52:17,481 --> 00:52:20,030
embodies the,
the divide,

1255
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:24,100
really intense difficulty in hunting.
It's,

1256
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,160
it's one of those things where,
I mean,

1257
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:27,530
it,
it's the ultimate challenge.

1258
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,210
I mean,
once you've,

1259
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:30,710
you know,
killed a bunch of elk and you know,

1260
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,770
I mean,
it gets to where it is the ultimate

1261
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:35,000
challenge and you're not always going to
win.

1262
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,500
I don't always get them.
I mean,

1263
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,670
that's,
that's the beauty of it.

1264
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:39,560
I mean,
like you never get to the point where

1265
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,910
you're so good.
Well,

1266
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,760
I haven't got to the point where I'm so
good where every great big one I get.

1267
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,743
I mean,
I,

1268
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,880
it's getting there,
I'm getting closer.

1269
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,170
But they do,
you know,

1270
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,200
like you're learning stuff all the time
and it's one of those things nobody can

1271
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,190
tell you about you.

1272
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,030
You can't,
you know,

1273
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:54,560
I'm,
I'm basically self taught.

1274
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,710
My Dad taught,
taught me how to read maps and until you

1275
00:52:57,711 --> 00:52:58,544
figure out,
you know,

1276
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,340
why isn't elk here?
What,

1277
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,630
what's he doing?
You know,

1278
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,580
and not just wandering around like,
oh,

1279
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:05,900
there's some elk over there,
but like,

1280
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:08,090
why is he here?
Why would he be here this time of year?

1281
00:53:08,091 --> 00:53:10,250
What is he doing?
Where's he going?

1282
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:11,390
What's his next move?
Like,

1283
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,150
I mean,
I've had bulls where I've hunted where I

1284
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:16,460
know what they're going to do before
they do a little worry.

1285
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:17,960
I know what that,
that bowl was down here.

1286
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,450
He was doing this and I was like,
I think I know what he's gonna do.

1287
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:23,540
And I go the other direction,
come around the other way.

1288
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,680
And that's what he did.
I knew before he was going to do it.

1289
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,880
Um,
it just,

1290
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,450
it just comes from watching them
spending thousands of hours and tis data

1291
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:31,284
chunking.

1292
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,340
Yeah.
And I mean,

1293
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,281
you,
you,

1294
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:34,650
you,
you see the picture of the great big

1295
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:35,730
bowls and it's,
that's,

1296
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,040
that's great.
But there is worth the time,

1297
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:41,310
the time that goes into that you'd like
nobody ever sees and they don't see

1298
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:43,890
hundreds and hundreds of days in
between.

1299
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:45,270
Um,
yeah,

1300
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:46,340
I was a young guy there,
man.

1301
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,020
2022 years old there.
It's amazing.

1302
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:50,130
Yeah,
it is.

1303
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:52,410
It is amazing.
And when you eat that animal,

1304
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,680
I mean the amount of satisfaction that
comes from sitting down to a meal that

1305
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:01,620
you procured and the most difficult way
humanly possible.

1306
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,230
I mean,
shot the thing with a bow and Arrow in

1307
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:06,450
the mountains and now here you are
eating it.

1308
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,860
12 yards snuck right upon.
Yeah.

1309
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:11,821
Yeah.
It's cool.

1310
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:12,371
I mean the,
the,

1311
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:14,610
the thing about trophy hunting that's
not understood.

1312
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:16,110
It's like,
it's the ultimate,

1313
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:19,020
it's the pinnacle of combining,
you know,

1314
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,720
what you love to do and then this
incredible skill set that you're

1315
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,720
developing to be better than,
you know,

1316
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,300
I'm not saying better than anybody else,
but it takes a lot of work,

1317
00:54:26,301 --> 00:54:27,570
like better than you used to be.

1318
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:29,520
Better than you used to eat to get
better and better.

1319
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,241
Yeah.
And,

1320
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:33,090
and you know,
the funny thing to me is always like

1321
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:34,650
the,
the thing trophy hunting has got this

1322
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,320
weird stigma with it or whatever.
And it's like,

1323
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,310
man,
I mean,

1324
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,280
I eat the whole elk.
I love doing it.

1325
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,020
I love the challenge of it.
I don't,

1326
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,880
you know,
I don't shy away from saying I love to

1327
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,590
kill animals.
I mean like,

1328
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,080
I love to hunt them.
I love the challenge of,

1329
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,910
you know,
take,

1330
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,540
you know,
of getting the biggest one.

1331
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,150
I find it the most challenging thing
I've ever done,

1332
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:55,500
but,
um,

1333
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,640
you don't,
I always eat it.

1334
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,830
I eat everything and you know,
and,

1335
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:00,240
and I take the hide and the head,
I mean,

1336
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,980
I'm using more than most people are,
you know,

1337
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,900
people like I just trophy hunting and
where be like,

1338
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:05,010
hmm,
that's,

1339
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:05,640
it's,
it,

1340
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,840
it's,
it's the challenge.

1341
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,620
I was,
I mean,

1342
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,200
the term needs to be changed.
It's the challenge of it.

1343
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,360
Well,
the term is kind of screwed up because

1344
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:15,060
it's applied to things that people shoot
where they don't need it.

1345
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,500
And which seems to be like a cruelty,
like a,

1346
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:22,200
a pursuit,
a vain pursuit of going out and shooting

1347
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:24,140
lions and shooting things.
You're not going to eat.

1348
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:27,180
The weird thing about that is I was,
I was talking to a guy was doing an

1349
00:55:27,181 --> 00:55:29,550
article for the New York Times and he's,
he said,

1350
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,740
I don't have a problem with people with
hunting,

1351
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:32,730
you know,
as long as you eat it.

1352
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,680
And I just said,
you don't have a problem with hunting.

1353
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:35,941
I mean,
it's,

1354
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:37,980
it's,
you legally have to take the meat.

1355
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,510
Um,
I mean,

1356
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,660
the amount of people that would shoot
something and not take the meat is,

1357
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,200
is the same as people that are thieves
out on the street.

1358
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,790
I mean,
it's so uncommon.

1359
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:50,040
So like the perception of,
you know,

1360
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,650
guys just shooting it and you know,
just because 10 years down the road,

1361
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:55,770
all I have in my garage as the head
doesn't mean that I didn't use it.

1362
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:57,210
And so the perception,
again,

1363
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,860
against the lowest common denominator
guy,

1364
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,940
you hear about one horrible thing going
on or somebody that doesn't take the

1365
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:05,040
meat and all of a sudden it's
everybody's lumped into it.

1366
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:07,200
I mean,
I grew up in rural Montana.

1367
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,300
I never had a beef steak at a restaurant
until I was on a recruiting trip in

1368
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:12,901
college.
I mean,

1369
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:15,450
I grew up eating wild game my entire
life.

1370
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,360
I never had my parents never bought meat
ever.

1371
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,070
That's probably why he's such a good
wrestler.

1372
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:20,671
Yeah,
I guess,

1373
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:23,770
right.
Get that fucking tear protein kicked

1374
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:24,604
that wild

1375
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,350
DNA in your system.
Free Range.

1376
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:27,310
Organic.
Yeah.

1377
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,851
Yeah.
That's,

1378
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,400
that's the real food.
But it's like a disconnect.

1379
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:32,010
They don't understand like,
oh man that you,

1380
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,640
you know,
like you don't need to do that.

1381
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:36,300
It's like I'm not saying we didn't need
to do it.

1382
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,510
That's just what we did.
I mean,

1383
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:39,910
I grew up in an area where that's,
that's what we,

1384
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,171
that's what I ate.
I don't,

1385
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:42,004
like I said,
I never,

1386
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,500
my parents never bought meat.
Yeah.

1387
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,160
The math section of hunting today,
so screwed up.

1388
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,140
It is,
but it's also because of cities.

1389
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,480
I mean,
one of the things that's made us be able

1390
00:56:49,481 --> 00:56:52,630
to be so comfortable and have air
conditioning is technology and

1391
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,270
advancement,
but it's also allowed us to be

1392
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:57,970
completely disconnected from where food
comes from.

1393
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,860
And that's what allows people to stand
up on these pedestals and point down at

1394
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:05,380
people that they think are doing
something wrong.

1395
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,200
When they're responsible for just as
much death.

1396
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:11,000
They're responsible for more suffering.
More suffer.

1397
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:11,834
Yeah,
exactly.

1398
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,780
Yeah.
More suffering than hunters for sure.

1399
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,120
Absolutely.
But just as much death too.

1400
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:19,240
And even people that are vegetarians,
even people that are,

1401
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:23,440
they think that by eating vegetables and
plants that they're doing no harm.

1402
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:28,590
The amount of wildlife habitat
displacement that takes place in just

1403
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:32,290
growing Kale is ridiculous.
And all the pesticides and everything

1404
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:35,440
else that goes into it,
it's my knees and the fucking rodents

1405
00:57:35,441 --> 00:57:40,441
and all the different death that is
associated with combines and widescale a

1406
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,460
grain,
uh,

1407
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,160
when you're,
when you're a growing and harvesting

1408
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,890
grain,
he does so much death and vulnerable and

1409
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:49,240
there's no getting around that.
I mean,

1410
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,730
we are consumers in some sort of a weird
way,

1411
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,170
but to me the purest pursuit of it is
what you're talking about.

1412
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:01,240
Archery hunting in the backwoods in the
most difficult environments.

1413
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:05,050
I mean,
it is unbelievably difficult pursuit

1414
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,040
that somehow or another it gets lumped
into this idea that it's a bunch of dumb

1415
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:11,140
people in their cruel.
If you're dumb,

1416
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:12,820
you're not going to be successful doing
that.

1417
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:15,250
And if you're lazy,
you're not going to be successful.

1418
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,980
You just not.
Yeah,

1419
00:58:16,981 --> 00:58:18,240
the,
I mean I've been,

1420
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,180
uh,
because a coup,

1421
00:58:19,181 --> 00:58:23,190
you had been in New York during a bunch
of media tours over the last year and to

1422
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:28,340
be interviewed by these people that live
in a big city that have no idea of what

1423
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:32,610
hunting is like or what it's about is
really mind blowing to me because it's

1424
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:35,280
been such a big part of my life and
everyone I'm associated with and friends

1425
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:37,770
with typically Hans or understands
hunting,

1426
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:43,250
their perception of it is so amazing to
me that we would just kill an animal,

1427
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:48,990
cut its head off and leave everything.
I don't know anybody that's ever done

1428
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,850
it.
It's completely illegal.

1429
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,330
And,
but that's what mainstream media is made

1430
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:54,960
out,
hunting,

1431
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,420
hunting to be.
And it's like a mission of mine now to

1432
00:58:57,421 --> 00:58:59,310
change that perception.
And mine as well.

1433
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,510
It's,
it's a lazy,

1434
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,750
it's a lazy perception of it.
It's not real.

1435
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,100
It doesn't happen.
Not,

1436
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:06,810
not for real hunting.
No.

1437
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,670
It absolutely does.
Never happens.

1438
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,290
Yeah.
I mean like this New York Times.

1439
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:10,921
Yeah.
I was just like,

1440
00:59:10,921 --> 00:59:11,460
yeah,
it's it,

1441
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,020
you know,
I took them through like the wanton

1442
00:59:13,021 --> 00:59:15,090
waste laws and all that and he was just
like,

1443
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,721
he's like,
wow,

1444
00:59:15,721 --> 00:59:17,350
that,
I mean you,

1445
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,550
you legally have to take it.
Like it's not,

1446
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,980
it's not something that's new,

1447
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,670
you know,
like it's,

1448
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,190
it's always been that way.
And then there is this cool meet

1449
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:27,180
movement that's been going on.
But you know,

1450
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,910
one thing it's like,
don't get it lost that,

1451
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,130
you know,
guys in the 60s,

1452
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,010
seventies all,
you know,

1453
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,090
since,
you know,

1454
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:33,830
aside from market hunting back in the
day,

1455
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:36,490
which isn't real hunting,
it was just extermination for,

1456
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,760
but I mean,
it's,

1457
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:41,210
you know,
people hunt and they consume what they

1458
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,560
eat.
Like anything else,

1459
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:45,900
just like eating bread or any,
anything else?

1460
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,310
I mean,
you have,

1461
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:47,143
you know,
it's like,

1462
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,550
you know,
you've got studs in your house.

1463
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:52,160
They came from a tree.
It's where they came from.

1464
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,333
Yeah,
exactly.

1465
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,640
Um,
I always say if you want to fix the

1466
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,130
health problems,
the United States make everybody hunt.

1467
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:00,950
The problem is none of the animals,
there's too many people.

1468
01:00:00,951 --> 01:00:03,470
And then to find those,
but it's like obesity,

1469
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:04,470
overweight,
you know,

1470
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,530
poor diet,
make them all hunters.

1471
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,720
That all goes away.
It does all go away cause they have to

1472
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:10,880
live a lifestyle to actually harvest an
animal.

1473
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:12,530
Yeah.
To change everything in hunting.

1474
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:12,951
You know,
I mean,

1475
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:14,720
God,
it's been our DNA for 2 million years

1476
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,880
and just the last hundred that people
had an issue with it.

1477
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,310
Not actually the last 50.
Yeah,

1478
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:22,220
it's,
well it's when you see things like the

1479
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:24,680
cecil the lion thing,
and then everybody gets up at arms about

1480
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:28,940
hunting and it just becomes this,
this really distorted version of what it

1481
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:29,810
actually is.
Yeah.

1482
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:31,640
But this stuff with Cecil,
that's not even true.

1483
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,080
I mean,
it wasn't,

1484
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,750
you know,
he wasn't living full time in the park.

1485
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:37,850
There's a new thing that just came out
in the hunt report about the,

1486
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,160
I mean the whole background of it.
I mean it's,

1487
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:42,650
there's a lot more to it than that and
it's all how you,

1488
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:43,940
hey,
how it said too,

1489
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:44,930
it's like,
you know,

1490
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:49,070
all the guy killed cecil line who was
just super old male who had been kicked

1491
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:50,630
out of the pride apparently,
you know,

1492
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:51,350
and,
and it's,

1493
01:00:51,350 --> 01:00:53,060
you know,
that whole thing with his brothers and

1494
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:53,990
the family and all that.

1495
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,730
It's hilarious.
And at the end of the day it's like,

1496
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,121
ah,
you know,

1497
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:57,680
it was shot him and beheaded them.
It's like,

1498
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:57,951
well,
Hey,

1499
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,780
that burger you got at Mcdonald's,
guess what?

1500
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:02,060
It died and got beheaded.
It's all how you would word it.

1501
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,030
You could also say it was processed.
I mean like it just beheaded.

1502
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:06,860
This is a horrible thing.
And it's like,

1503
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,080
yeah,
everything that gets killed and process

1504
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,170
gets beheaded.
But don't you think that part of the

1505
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:15,170
reason why people get upset about lions,
because people generally don't eat

1506
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,540
lions.
So when someone says that someone goes

1507
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:20,330
and shoots a line,
like why would you shoot this beautiful,

1508
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:21,860
rare,
majestic animal?

1509
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:26,861
Just he could stick it on your wall and,
and just think you're a bad ass because

1510
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:30,140
you've got this thing that could kill
you if you didn't have a weapon and

1511
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:31,370
you've got it on your wall now.

1512
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:32,931
Well,
I mean,

1513
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,850
it,
it comes down to like predators need to

1514
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:35,900
be controlled.
I mean,

1515
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:37,220
it's,
it's not one of those things that's

1516
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:39,080
pretty,
and people really love to hear that.

1517
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:40,760
But at the end of the day,
it is true.

1518
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:41,150
I mean,
like,

1519
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,040
you know,
you were just down where I grew up.

1520
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:45,210
I grew up in just north of the,
uh,

1521
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,470
of the greater yellowstone elk herd,
you know,

1522
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,190
between gardener and Livingston.
That's where I grew up.

1523
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:52,610
And when I was in high school,
there was 19,000 elk in that hurt.

1524
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,070
You go down there and wintertime is he
1500 bulls.

1525
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:55,881
I mean,
it was,

1526
01:01:55,881 --> 01:01:58,670
it was amazing.
And they're down to two to 3000 now

1527
01:01:58,671 --> 01:01:59,390
because of,
you know,

1528
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,710
the reintroduction of the wolf,
you know,

1529
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:03,310
like you have to control predators,
um,

1530
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,820
anywhere,
wherever they're at.

1531
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:05,654
I mean it's,
it's,

1532
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:10,660
it's insane to think that we don't exist
and these houses and fences and highways

1533
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:14,690
and stuff are not there and that you can
just turn something loose and just let

1534
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:16,880
it run its course.
And you know what you mean?

1535
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,500
People or even appalled by the natural
core.

1536
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:20,340
I mean,
when you see

1537
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:26,030
a young lion take over the pride and
Cecil gets chumped and destroyed by two

1538
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:27,830
other younger lines that came in and
got,

1539
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:29,550
when people don't even like seeing that.
Right.

1540
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,710
That's just how it happened.
It's just attachment.

1541
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,900
Just detachment from the actual cycle of
life.

1542
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,793
It is.
Yeah.

1543
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:38,220
And the other thing that's going on is
that people love to,

1544
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:38,710
they,
they,

1545
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:43,710
they love to broadcast how horrible the
people are that hunt these things and

1546
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:46,740
how these lions are new.
They need to be preserved.

1547
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:49,230
And it's so important.
Like Leonardo Dicaprio had something on

1548
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:53,400
his instagram page the other day where
it was like an anniversary of the death

1549
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:55,800
of Cecil,
and he was talking about how,

1550
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:57,900
you know,
a few of these animals that are left,

1551
01:02:57,901 --> 01:03:00,170
they have to be protected.
What he see,

1552
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,480
Rick conveniently ignores the fact that
Zimbabwe is going to kill 200 lions now

1553
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,610
because no one's going over there to
hunt those lines.

1554
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:10,350
It's just going to talk about,
there's more of them.

1555
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:12,400
So they're decimating the undulate
population,

1556
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:14,190
so now they're going to kill them and
make no money.

1557
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,890
So they're gonna lose out on millions of
dollars in revenue.

1558
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:20,010
What would you expect from a guy that
had got attacked by a CGI bear?

1559
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,160
I mean,
he doesn't live in reality anyway,

1560
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:25,550
I CGI,
but you probably didn't even ride.

1561
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,170
He's probably doing coke and banging
hookers.

1562
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,210
Call assists that.
Hey man,

1563
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:33,210
put something eco on my page.
CCS anniversary.

1564
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,470
Yeah.
Now they're now they can't.

1565
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,670
Now.
That's a ton of money they could

1566
01:03:35,671 --> 01:03:37,710
generate to shoot those.
And I know guy,

1567
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:38,560
I mean,
I know booking,

1568
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:39,420
yeah,
talk to him all the time.

1569
01:03:39,421 --> 01:03:41,580
There's guy that nobody will touch that
with a 10 foot pole.

1570
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:42,690
Yeah,
it's a great hunt.

1571
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:45,570
It's a cool thing to go see.
They do need to be managed.

1572
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,650
I mean,
you know,

1573
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,160
like a lot of things like it just is
what it is very,

1574
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:53,370
it's very inconvenient when you look at
the actual facts of,

1575
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,500
of hunting over there,
even hunting,

1576
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:57,330
you know,
just quote unquote for trophies.

1577
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,690
That is where they get a massive amount
of their revenue.

1578
01:04:00,691 --> 01:04:02,700
It feeds a lot of the people that are
over there.

1579
01:04:02,701 --> 01:04:06,120
It makes a huge impact on their economy
and a lot of people don't like that.

1580
01:04:06,121 --> 01:04:11,121
But I urge people to watch the Louis
Theroux documentary about his trip to

1581
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:14,700
Africa where he spent,
he spent several weeks in this African

1582
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:17,520
hunting camp and you know,
it was the same thing was it was like a

1583
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:21,570
high fence operation where they had
lions and they were throwing like calves

1584
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:24,990
over the fence to feed these lines.
It was like two fences separating him

1585
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:28,650
from the lions and he got to see like in
depth what's going on.

1586
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:31,830
He's essentially saying that these
animals,

1587
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:35,940
the only reason why they're here at all,
like massive amounts of them is because

1588
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:37,830
they're worth something because they
have to come over.

1589
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:42,831
And if it wasn't that like this place is
so poor and so crazy that these animals

1590
01:04:43,771 --> 01:04:44,780
would have been wiped out.
They,

1591
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,940
and they were on the verge just a couple
of decades ago before the introduced

1592
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:50,460
hunting.
So it's such a catch 22 because they

1593
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:52,680
have more animals than they've ever had
before.

1594
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:55,860
But the reason for that is because
they're worth something to hunt.

1595
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,800
Exactly their economic resource.
And because of that they have value.

1596
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,760
So they're protected and there's money
to protect him and people get put off by

1597
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:05,040
the fact that people enjoy that pursuit.
Yeah.

1598
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,420
And it's,
you know,

1599
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:09,630
it's one of those things like I have a
hard time explaining it to people that,

1600
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,900
you know,
I mean what makes a little kid who when

1601
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:14,400
you're in the yard and there's a bird
right there,

1602
01:05:14,401 --> 01:05:15,870
like some kids,
you know,

1603
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,070
just look at it and some want to chase
that thing

1604
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,470
down and it's like 10,000 years where
the genetics at say 2 million actually.

1605
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,420
Yeah.
You want to do it like this is something

1606
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,650
that is built in,
you want to do,

1607
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:29,830
I mean you felt that you didn't draw up
hunting then all of a sudden now you,

1608
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:30,803
you,
you,

1609
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:32,290
you can't,
I mean you think about it every day.

1610
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,610
That's all you want to do,
I'm sure.

1611
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,900
And so to explain that to somebody that
doesn't have that,

1612
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,550
it's really hard.
I mean,

1613
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,280
you know,
especially whether eating a hamburger on

1614
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:44,850
from their pedestal telling you how you
know,

1615
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,500
you shouldn't kill anything.
Yeah.

1616
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,110
Well I almost think,
I mean I don't think anybody should be

1617
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:52,810
forced to do anything,
but I almost think that it would be good

1618
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:55,300
for everybody to have to kill something
and eat it.

1619
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:59,410
If you do eat meat just to experience it
and I mean that's just killing

1620
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:01,600
something,
but to actually go out and hunt

1621
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:06,520
something down and kill it and eat it,
I think would would open up a lot of of

1622
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:10,870
doors inside your,
your your mind open up a lot of areas of

1623
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:14,110
perception and give you this real
understanding of what it means to

1624
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:15,340
consume life.

1625
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:16,510
It's,
it's,

1626
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,470
it's,
there's a,

1627
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,740
there's a lot to it.
It's a very complex thing that's going

1628
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:23,120
on when you're eating an animal a lot to
it.

1629
01:06:23,121 --> 01:06:25,510
It's like you talked about that
disconnect me and there is a massive

1630
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:26,560
disconnect.
Yeah,

1631
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:28,300
it's weird.
It's people think just because it's in a

1632
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:31,180
package at a grocery store in the
cellophane with a styrofoam thing

1633
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:33,400
underneath that is not,
didn't come from an animal or something.

1634
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,010
Yeah,
but you should almost have to watch.

1635
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:38,140
Even if you're not going to go,
you should almost have to be there

1636
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,170
whether they kill the cow and then
string it up and then cut it on people.

1637
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,820
How many people would become vegetarians
at?

1638
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:45,400
Right?
Remember that whole cow thing that went

1639
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,440
on a couple of years ago,
I think it was in a slaughter house down

1640
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,450
in southern California.
And those cows are sick and they're

1641
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:52,600
falling over and they've got video of it
and it got out there about the

1642
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:55,410
processing of meat and all these people
up in arms about it.

1643
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:57,760
And like that's always been that way.
Yeah.

1644
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,450
And it just got public.
People were appalled by it.

1645
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:06,451
But that's the reality of beef and
industrial food complex versus the

1646
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:08,350
animals that we hunt.
I forget.

1647
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:09,790
I have a great life.
You know,

1648
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,230
most of them,
like the one Brendan,

1649
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,430
the animal is Brendan.
I hunt,

1650
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:14,920
which of the older ones,
they've had a full life and they've had

1651
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:18,740
the opportunity to experience things in
nature and um,

1652
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,760
reproduce and have,
you know,

1653
01:07:22,210 --> 01:07:25,430
what an animal's life should be like.
We're a cattle or you know,

1654
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:30,480
any type of industrial type of a food
animal like chickens or cows or pigs.

1655
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,930
I mean,
that's that.

1656
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:34,960
I mean,
it's like living in a concentration

1657
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:36,820
camp.
It depends on the situation too.

1658
01:07:36,821 --> 01:07:37,840
I mean,
like my,

1659
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:40,420
my wife's,
my wife's father has a big ranch in

1660
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:43,900
eastern Montana and they raise and
process all their own stuff and you

1661
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:44,890
know,
like people talking about,

1662
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:47,290
you know,
like all the beef and meets horrible and

1663
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,660
stuff,
not,

1664
01:07:48,661 --> 01:07:49,690
weren't know where I come from.

1665
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:51,070
I mean,
they take really good care of those

1666
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,070
animals and it's very important and they
don't go to the,

1667
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:55,980
you know,
the giant stock yards and all,

1668
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,130
it just,
it just depends.

1669
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:59,440
It's all relative.
You've got to look at everything as it

1670
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:00,110
is.
You know,

1671
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:00,750
what,
you know,

1672
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,680
where did that come from?
At least you know where it's more

1673
01:08:02,681 --> 01:08:03,640
connected.
Yeah.

1674
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,630
When people hear about grass fed beef,
one of the big complaints ago,

1675
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:07,810
God,
it's so expensive,

1676
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,610
but yeah,
it's not supposed to be that cheap deet

1677
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,800
life,
you know?

1678
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:13,360
Exactly.
You know what I mean?

1679
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:15,650
I mean like,
state can be so cheap.

1680
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:16,370
It's ridiculous.

1681
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:20,720
You think about the amount of effort
that has to go for you to get this $5

1682
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,540
steak,
the amount of effort that the animal has

1683
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:25,220
to grow,
it has to be fed and has to be taken

1684
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,360
care of.
It then has to be slaughtered,

1685
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,040
cut up,
package processed,

1686
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:31,100
send to stores,
put on the shelves and then you go and

1687
01:08:31,101 --> 01:08:33,440
buy like what are the prices like,
oh my God,

1688
01:08:33,441 --> 01:08:36,620
no shit of yours could try doing it
yourself and you would value it.

1689
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:37,700
You would realize like,
wow,

1690
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:40,160
this is actually a pretty good deal and
all and all the,

1691
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:42,110
all the process,
but it's not all the same either.

1692
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,180
Like I said,
I mean there's lots of great ranchers

1693
01:08:44,181 --> 01:08:45,890
that,
that care about what they're doing and

1694
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:47,450
and,
and do it right and all that stuff.

1695
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:48,380
And you know,
again,

1696
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:49,760
you lowest common denominator.
You get,

1697
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,730
you know,
a place that's got 70 cows packed into

1698
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:55,010
one shoot and people are like,
oh my God,

1699
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:55,820
we're up in arms about it.

1700
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:56,720
It's like,
well that's not,

1701
01:08:56,750 --> 01:08:58,760
that's not the norm.
Everything either.

1702
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,890
I think it's good though.
The people were being aware of this.

1703
01:09:00,891 --> 01:09:04,100
And I think it's good that people are up
in arms because I think there is

1704
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,260
something really disgusting about
factory farming.

1705
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,680
Undeniably disgusting.
And I think the education of people and

1706
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,780
getting to understand like,
yeah,

1707
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:14,990
this is a system that you're a part of.
Even like the really hardcore radical

1708
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,570
animal activists that you know,
risk their,

1709
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:18,010
um,
their,

1710
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:21,770
their lives and make these crazy fucking
videos and get inside slaughter houses

1711
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:23,780
and you know,
violate those ag gag laws.

1712
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:26,270
I salute them.
I saw I it too out there.

1713
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,790
I do too.
I mean it shows the other side of it.

1714
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,693
Yeah.
That,

1715
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,370
you know,
the bad side of it.

1716
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,630
Yeah.
We don't get to see it.

1717
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,940
We shouldn't be shielded from the truth
in any way,

1718
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:35,630
shape or form.

1719
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,320
And that's one of the things that's
allowed this factory farm system to get

1720
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,630
so disgusting.
It's the fact that people haven't been

1721
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:44,210
able to have their input.
They haven't been able to see it and

1722
01:09:44,211 --> 01:09:46,070
protest against it and say like,
Hey,

1723
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:46,441
you,
you,

1724
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:48,350
you,
you shouldn't be treating living things

1725
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,420
like this.
Totally agree.

1726
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,400
I mean that's,
that story doesn't get told enough.

1727
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:57,500
And I think the reasonable people who
love animals and maybe they don't have

1728
01:09:57,501 --> 01:10:00,950
any desire whatsoever to eat them,
that those are the people that I think

1729
01:10:00,951 --> 01:10:03,800
respect the pursuit of hunting and
respect.

1730
01:10:03,801 --> 01:10:07,100
The idea that you look a person,
it's not something for everybody,

1731
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,700
but neither is marathon running.
Neither is weightlifting,

1732
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,450
neither is so true.
Football,

1733
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:13,490
Jujitsu,
anything difficult wrestling these,

1734
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,990
this is not for everybody.
You know,

1735
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,180
everybody's not going to do a lot of
things that are hard to do,

1736
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:21,170
but if you want to procure meat,
that's the best way to do it.

1737
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,290
Couldn't agree more and everything that
goes into it.

1738
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,300
Yeah,
that's what I love about it.

1739
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:28,280
Well I think it's important to spread
that.

1740
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,460
I think that's sort of getting out there
as well as the,

1741
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:34,610
there's this anti meat movement and
anti,

1742
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:36,920
you know,
animal cruelty movement and I respect

1743
01:10:36,921 --> 01:10:38,180
that.
I understand where they're coming from.

1744
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:41,060
I also thought,
unless you're driving the lexus with the

1745
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:44,730
leather seats,
I mean honestly it's like,

1746
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,643
it's like,
you know,

1747
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,560
you see it all the time guy wearing
leather shoes and a leather belt,

1748
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,060
you know,
talking about,

1749
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,520
you know,
his impact and how little,

1750
01:10:52,521 --> 01:10:53,810
you know,
being Vegan or whatever.

1751
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:54,530
It's like,
man,

1752
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:57,890
that's just the hypocrisy is insane of
people.

1753
01:10:57,891 --> 01:10:58,910
You know,
like living in a house,

1754
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:03,200
like how much is animal biproduct from
from everything you use.

1755
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:04,790
And it's like,
well yeah,

1756
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:06,170
but I just had a salad today.

1757
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:10,680
It's like that's,
I mean 50 rabbits when the harvest is,

1758
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,830
it made you feel good,
but in reality you're just bullshitting

1759
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:14,730
yourself.
Yeah.

1760
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:16,560
But they don't even know they're
bullshitting themselves.

1761
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:18,930
If they,
if their perception of what they're

1762
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:21,570
doing was accurate,
then they would have a good point.

1763
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,720
But it's a,
it's an ignorance to what was actually

1764
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:25,810
involved.
You know,

1765
01:11:26,330 --> 01:11:28,320
don't,
I don't believe in killing anything.

1766
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:30,360
It's like every time you get in your
car,

1767
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:31,320
man.
I mean the most animal,

1768
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:34,890
the most life I've ever taken it.
Every time we take a 500 mile road trip

1769
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,200
and I got to wipe those things off my
window.

1770
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:38,840
I mean like,
I mean people,

1771
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:39,631
people are like,
oh,

1772
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:42,220
you can kill the shit out of bugs,
you know,

1773
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:43,710
fish or cool or whatever.
It's like,

1774
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,120
Ooh,
we got eyelids involved now.

1775
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:45,960
It's getting weird.
It's like,

1776
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,980
wow,
where does it work?

1777
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:47,760
Where is it?
Yeah,

1778
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,080
exactly.
I used to live in boulder and uh,

1779
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:53,150
I live next to an osh rom and the lady
that ran the Ashram,

1780
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:55,630
that's a Buddhist Ashram,
she's to poison the aunt

1781
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:58,230
and I said,
do I go,

1782
01:11:58,231 --> 01:11:59,550
what are you doing?
I go,

1783
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:00,960
you poisoned the aunts.
She was like,

1784
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:02,010
well,
it's inconvenient.

1785
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:04,350
We really don't like to do it.
But they get in our kitchen and like,

1786
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:05,950
oh shit.
Yeah.

1787
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:07,120
That's where you draw the line.
You,

1788
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:09,930
you guys are,
this is some weird gray area.

1789
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:13,470
You've mentioned you're a murderer later
mass where you've killed fucking

1790
01:12:13,471 --> 01:12:17,640
thousands of beans just today,
but in the ant a weird one because like

1791
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,880
I've seen people like they'll see an ant
on them,

1792
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,720
they'll squish it and then they flick it
on the ground in your house.

1793
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,400
Totally.
So little.

1794
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:29,040
They don't care that it hits your
kitchen floor.

1795
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:29,850
Yeah,
exactly.

1796
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:32,070
But if it was a mouse,
if like someone in your house stopped a

1797
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,510
mouse in the middle of your kitchen and
be like,

1798
01:12:33,511 --> 01:12:36,120
what the fuck dude?
Like Jesus Christ,

1799
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:38,580
this is it.
Cause it makes more of a mess and now

1800
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:42,620
you have to consider what's actually
going on in there until totally people

1801
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:44,280
fucking weird.
They're weird.

1802
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:45,090
Yeah.
It's weird.

1803
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:47,340
I mean,
but that's not really what I wanted to

1804
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:49,830
bring you guys in and out.
That's like a beaten to death subject on

1805
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:51,090
this point.
Talk about ants.

1806
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,790
No,
Da began fan.

1807
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:54,633
Yeah,
they're cool.

1808
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,360
We wouldn't be amazing to be able to
pick shit up that was that much bigger

1809
01:12:57,361 --> 01:12:58,770
than you and walk around within your
mouth.

1810
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,970
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1811
01:12:59,971 --> 01:13:01,530
Well impressive.
When it turns to,

1812
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,540
when you start talking about what
they're capable of.

1813
01:13:03,541 --> 01:13:04,920
Yeah.
And while it's also,

1814
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,410
this isn't like an ant,
the size of a cat could be able to pick

1815
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:08,070
up a house.

1816
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:08,821
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1817
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:12,150
And they no freewill whatsoever.
There's no decision making.

1818
01:13:12,710 --> 01:13:15,240
They just do,
have you ever seen those ant death

1819
01:13:15,241 --> 01:13:16,350
spirals?
No.

1820
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,480
Got to check it out.
You put pull something like that up.

1821
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:23,560
The ants follow.
The firm owns of the queen and when

1822
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,140
[inaudible] when something goes,
yeah,

1823
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:27,420
I get it too.
When something goes wrong,

1824
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:32,010
when something goes wrong,
like they're sent gets screwed up or the

1825
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:34,620
queen dies or the queen gets removed.
But the sense still there,

1826
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,790
the ants will circle,
they'll circle each other and spires.

1827
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:41,370
Yup.
Like a hurricane until they all die.

1828
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,100
And you talking about thousands of
really?

1829
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:46,140
Yep.
And they'll keep circling.

1830
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,380
No one knows what the fuck's going on.
That's the True Power of pee right

1831
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:50,170
there.
Yeah.

1832
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:52,710
I mean look at this amazing.
And a few of them are going the wrong

1833
01:13:52,711 --> 01:13:56,190
way.
Like there's a few rebels that looks

1834
01:13:56,191 --> 01:13:59,490
like that looks,
it looks like the freeways is southern

1835
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:00,030
California.

1836
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:01,470
It looks like a hurricane.
It does.

1837
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,401
I mean,
he really does.

1838
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:03,990
That's the eye of the storm in the
center there.

1839
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,090
And they're,
they're circling around and they don't

1840
01:14:06,091 --> 01:14:07,770
know what the fuck is.
Dead Queen.

1841
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:09,810
Yeah.
Well it's either a dead queen.

1842
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,310
I'm not exactly Jamie.
See if he could find out the actual

1843
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:15,090
exact,
they can't release any for it.

1844
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,880
Now.
They don't know they're following you

1845
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,200
and some sort of a way.
But when they're doing this,

1846
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:22,030
um,
I mean this is,

1847
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:26,560
this is just shows that this,
this being these a aunts have no,

1848
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,990
you don't have to just find an actual
explanation for it.

1849
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,730
Not a video.
But when these,

1850
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:32,200
um,
these animals are doing this,

1851
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:33,910
like they don't,
they don't have any free will they have

1852
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,780
this,
does this,

1853
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,540
this sort of directive.
This is what they do.

1854
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:37,961
You know,
they,

1855
01:14:37,961 --> 01:14:40,240
they make the nest,
they build a beehive,

1856
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:41,590
they do this,
they change.

1857
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,400
Like a friend of mine was a Ben O'brian.
He has no band on Brian from a used to

1858
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:50,401
be worked for Peterson's a fucking 19 he
was telling me about one of his friends

1859
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,560
had a queen bee somehow or they get
stuck in their car and this hive of bees

1860
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,820
followed them for 20 miles.
They followed the car for 20 miles

1861
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:03,100
because the baby was in the car like
they,

1862
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,540
they don't have any like,
man,

1863
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,160
she's gone.
Maybe we've got to let her go.

1864
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:10,870
We got to push on because none of that,
like there's no free will.

1865
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:11,830
It's just what they do.
Yeah.

1866
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:13,840
There's no decision making.
It's just what they do.

1867
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,240
The cuisine that we follow her,
they never give up.

1868
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:22,050
It's a bizarre form of life and they
have these really weird things that they

1869
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:23,240
do.
If you've seen like,

1870
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:28,480
like videos on different ant species
where the females will chop the males

1871
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,260
legs off I think is that leaf cutter
ants to do that.

1872
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:33,850
I forget which one,
but they chop,

1873
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:37,000
they take the mail when they're going to
breed with them and they essentially cut

1874
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:41,740
his legs off so that he can't move and
then they carry him to wherever they

1875
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:43,900
want.
They want to fuck him and then they take

1876
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:47,640
him and breed with them.
I've met a couple of girls like that in

1877
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,080
a bad way to go about it.
Like yeah,

1878
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:53,920
like the lion there,
a stub.

1879
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,590
All the [inaudible] will come out of
here,

1880
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:01,300
but and again,
no thought process.

1881
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:03,580
There is no meeting.
They don't have a board where they sit

1882
01:16:03,581 --> 01:16:06,250
down and decide how to do this with the
mail.

1883
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:08,350
They just go about the way they've
always done it.

1884
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:09,340
Yeah.
What a trip,

1885
01:16:09,341 --> 01:16:11,020
Huh?
Yeah.

1886
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:13,810
Here we go.
How to make ants commit suicide going to

1887
01:16:13,811 --> 01:16:17,890
happen.
You can make it happen to a potted plant

1888
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:20,460
and they'll just start following each
other and next thing you know,

1889
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:22,240
see what we should bring all down on the
show.

1890
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,790
We could put one right here,
it'd be rude and people would be angry.

1891
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:27,460
Did protest.
That's cruel.

1892
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:30,370
But that's the thing,
like certain amount of death is okay.

1893
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:32,980
I mean every time you wash your body,
you're killing flora,

1894
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,370
you're killing the living,
living organisms that are on the surface

1895
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:38,170
of your skin.
There's no getting around it.

1896
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:42,490
And there's no way to live a life where
you're not killing other life.

1897
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:44,830
It's,
there's this constant cycle that's going

1898
01:16:44,831 --> 01:16:49,480
on in some sort of a weird way that most
of us are detached from way.

1899
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:53,710
It's always been bizarre not to be in
touch with it and or just to deny it.

1900
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,300
I mean like,
oh I'm not,

1901
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,550
I'm not doing that.
Amen.

1902
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:58,810
I mean,
and there are like,

1903
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,200
there are a few people that,
you know,

1904
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,760
try as hard as they can and all that.
But most people like they don't give up

1905
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:04,090
though.

1906
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:05,700
They love the idea.
Yeah.

1907
01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:09,770
But you know,
implementation is where it complicated I

1908
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:11,630
think is also a problem with
entertainment,

1909
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,990
like the anthropomorphizing of animals
and Disney movies and things along those

1910
01:17:14,991 --> 01:17:17,330
lines.
So like when you think of an animal,

1911
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:19,670
you think of this big ferry lovable
thing.

1912
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:23,000
You don't think of this,
you know like with an alk is essentially

1913
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:27,020
a warrior.
It's this living warrior that has a

1914
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:30,140
weapons grown out of its head and they
run around the kill each other.

1915
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:31,470
When I was at the home ranch,
you,

1916
01:17:31,471 --> 01:17:35,750
you've been to that place,
they found this huge like three 90 class

1917
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:39,230
bowl dead that had been stabbed by
another bowl.

1918
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:43,580
It just random through and he was lying
there dead on the side of the mountain

1919
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,780
with holes in his body from the other
bowl.

1920
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:48,920
Just fucking headbutted him to death.
I'm going through it right now.

1921
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,640
I've got a four year old son and he
watched this little show called the lion

1922
01:17:52,641 --> 01:17:55,400
guard,
which is like in all these animals get

1923
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:58,040
together and they're all friends.
And we started watching,

1924
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,350
he would ask questions and stuff and,
and now I'm like,

1925
01:18:00,351 --> 01:18:01,360
we watch,
you know,

1926
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,960
if you want to watch the lion guard,
that's fine.

1927
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:07,340
But I've explained to them like the
Cheetah and the lion and the hippo,

1928
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,230
they don't get along.
They're not buddies.

1929
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,960
And we watch discovery channel and he
watched it.

1930
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:15,050
You know,
like the other day we just watched the

1931
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,940
willdabeast couple of days ago we
pitched the willdabeast getting eaten by

1932
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:19,670
the crocodile and he was just like,
Whoa,

1933
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:20,450
you know,
it's like,

1934
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:21,860
and now like when it comes up,
he's like,

1935
01:18:21,861 --> 01:18:24,010
well that's just pretend but I want to
watch that.

1936
01:18:24,011 --> 01:18:24,741
And it's like,
that's fine.

1937
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:25,980
As long as we know,
you know,

1938
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,680
that's not really how it goes.

1939
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,420
You know,
we'll go discovery channel and watch you

1940
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,040
know,
killers on the savannah and you know,

1941
01:18:31,041 --> 01:18:31,960
it's like wow,
you know,

1942
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:34,940
the line doesn't get along with anybody.
He eats everybody and you know,

1943
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:38,090
I don't want my kid to to think that you
know,

1944
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:42,110
oh it's just big peaceful thing and
they're all symbiotic relationship and

1945
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:43,670
they all love each other now.
Man,

1946
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:46,760
that ain't what's going on.
It's weird the way we've chosen to

1947
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:50,150
distort these animals.
And like polar bears,

1948
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:52,490
like there was a picture that was going
on in instagram.

1949
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:56,210
A lot of people were posting up of this
enormous polar bear walking around with

1950
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:59,390
a cubs head and its mouth.
You've got everyday occurrence,

1951
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,380
they're cannibals.
100% of the males are cannibals and most

1952
01:19:03,381 --> 01:19:06,590
people have no idea this.
So they think of a polar Baylor Klondike

1953
01:19:06,591 --> 01:19:08,650
bar.
Cocacola salesperson.

1954
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,111
Yeah.
Yeah.

1955
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:13,100
There's the photo that's been going on
and this is just food for them.

1956
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:13,911
Absolutely.
I mean,

1957
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:15,620
in a polar bear,
he's not an omnivore.

1958
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,470
No.
100% people.

1959
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:20,150
He's whatever he can get ahold of.
Yeah.

1960
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:21,500
I mean,
that's all they eat is meat.

1961
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:24,620
They're not like a black bear or any
other bear that can eat anything.

1962
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:28,460
All they need is flesh.
That's that bear at the zoo is eaten

1963
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:29,300
meat.
Yeah.

1964
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:30,770
You know,
they don't let you see it,

1965
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,500
but the,
the polar bear at the zoo just hammering

1966
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:34,250
away at it.
I mean,

1967
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:36,260
they all,
that's one of the darker things about

1968
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:38,450
the zoo too,
is we take them away from their actual

1969
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,310
purpose.
I think if you're going to have a zoo,

1970
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:43,070
which he'd be like,
you should have animals that if you ever

1971
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:47,750
see that zoo in Iraq that they had
before we invaded Iraq,

1972
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:51,320
they um,
they had zoos where they used to just

1973
01:19:51,321 --> 01:19:55,460
let like a goat loose and then they
would open up the gate and let the lions

1974
01:19:55,461 --> 01:20:00,461
come out and Jack the goat and these
soldiers took videos of these things and

1975
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:02,810
people were like aghast.

1976
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:07,010
Like I don't understand why you think
you should be able to keep a lion but

1977
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,140
don't let ally and to be lion like
you're going to do all the killing.

1978
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,960
Has you giving him some fake meat?
No.

1979
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:14,160
You giving them real meat.
Okay,

1980
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,000
so something had to die in order to get,
but you don't want him to do it.

1981
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:21,210
Why don't you want him to do it?
Like what the fuck are you doing?

1982
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:21,841
Yeah,
exactly.

1983
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:22,800
What,
what is the zoo?

1984
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:24,070
Trust me,
the line wants to hear.

1985
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,410
Yeah,
that's what they live for.

1986
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:25,770
The,
here,

1987
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,980
here's the video.
So they have these goats and these goats

1988
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:31,200
are just wandering around.
They have no idea.

1989
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:34,890
They let them lose and then they open up
the gate and when they open up the gate,

1990
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:36,900
the lions,
apparently they do this all the time.

1991
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:40,320
So they're hip to what's going to go.
They're stretched out and ready to go.

1992
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:43,930
Oh yeah,
tape it to it spreads.

1993
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:46,230
They don't want to pull a Hammy when
they get the goat.

1994
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:50,550
So they open up the gate and as soon as
they open up the gate is just on like

1995
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:53,670
donkey Kong.
I bet they got walk out music and

1996
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:55,060
everything.
They were just ready.

1997
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,800
Yeah,
totally.

1998
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:00,230
This queen is playing.
We will,

1999
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,420
we will rock you.
Yeah,

2000
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:05,190
it goes boom.
They open up the gate.

2001
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,290
I like that too.
It's not that weird to be fascinated by

2002
01:21:13,291 --> 01:21:14,820
that.
And for those guys to look at that and

2003
01:21:14,821 --> 01:21:15,211
go,
wow,

2004
01:21:15,211 --> 01:21:15,751
that's,
you know,

2005
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,550
that's,
that's lions being lions like that's

2006
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:19,350
pretty well,
I mean they're going to eat today one

2007
01:21:19,351 --> 01:21:21,330
way or the other.
And here's another interesting thing.

2008
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:25,090
It's interesting for us to watch.
If we're watching and we're going Whoa,

2009
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:26,580
and were laughing,
oh my God.

2010
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:28,380
But if we were there and we were
laughing,

2011
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:30,870
then people get upset.
Like there's an instinct to like,

2012
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:34,290
listen to those guys laughing while it's
happening because they're filming it

2013
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:35,940
right through the fence and go,
wow,

2014
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:38,430
a bunch of assholes laughing at death.
But meanwhile,

2015
01:21:38,431 --> 01:21:40,380
it's okay to laugh at if it's on a
youtube video,

2016
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,900
it's totally their kid to throw a bug in
a,

2017
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:45,840
in a,
in a tank and,

2018
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:46,950
and watch a fish eat it.

2019
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:47,760
It's like,
oh,

2020
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,593
cool.
Right.

2021
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,310
But it's like a goat and a lion.
It's like,

2022
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:51,121
well,
that's good.

2023
01:21:51,121 --> 01:21:52,710
Well,
it's like watching a fight.

2024
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,240
Yeah.
I mean,

2025
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:56,120
we want to see the guy get knocked out.
Right.

2026
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,720
Next step is death.
Right?

2027
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,060
It don't take it as close as possible.
Oh yeah.

2028
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:01,620
I mean,
we find thrilling that,

2029
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,420
well,
the guy chokes the guy out and he stops

2030
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:05,700
off of him and he's totally unconscious.
The only difference between that and

2031
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:07,910
death is time.
The amount of time really has a chunk.

2032
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,290
That's it.
That's it.

2033
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,370
Keep that choke on for another minute.
That guy's dead.

2034
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,121
Yup.
You know,

2035
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:14,160
or not even a minute.
And we get millions of people that want

2036
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:14,994
to watch it.
Yeah.

2037
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:17,460
But at least that's,
they make a decision.

2038
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,650
They both make a decision.
They're both going to enter into this

2039
01:22:19,651 --> 01:22:24,090
and it's an extreme form of a
competition with dire physical

2040
01:22:24,091 --> 01:22:24,780
consequences.

2041
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:26,310
And that's why it's so exciting to
watch.

2042
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:29,490
I mean,
I think the parallels when you're

2043
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,040
watching something like that,
it was a little different.

2044
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:33,760
A little different,
but it's still sad.

2045
01:22:33,790 --> 01:22:35,280
It's a detachment thing.
It is.

2046
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:36,143
Yeah.
It's,

2047
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:36,660
well,
you know,

2048
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:39,990
we watch a movie,
you can watch a movie where 10 people

2049
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:42,150
get shot and they get punched and
kicked.

2050
01:22:42,151 --> 01:22:43,950
Everybody gets their ass kicked.
But if they fuck,

2051
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:46,860
if they're naked and they start to go,
what are you showing me?

2052
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,620
What is this like?
People are weird.

2053
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,810
We're real weird.
I like to draw the line on certain

2054
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:54,540
things for whatever reasons.
It doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

2055
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,350
No,
it doesn't.

2056
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:56,930
It doesn't.
That's why we're the Huntington.

2057
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,240
You can't win it all.
No,

2058
01:22:58,290 --> 01:22:58,571
I mean,
you,

2059
01:22:58,571 --> 01:23:00,640
you do,
you do as good a job as you can and

2060
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:03,170
putting forward at an educated,
you know,

2061
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,730
opinion of why we do,
and,

2062
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:06,030
and,

2063
01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:08,500
and,
and at the same time being,

2064
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:10,900
you know,
where I'm unapologetic about it too.

2065
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,030
It's not like so many.
So there's not a conversation that could

2066
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:16,030
convince me that what I'm doing isn't
what I was meant to do,

2067
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:17,431
you know?
No.

2068
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:18,850
When it comes to hunting,
I mean,

2069
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:19,380
you,
you,

2070
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:20,890
you don't,
you put forward,

2071
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,810
you know,
we try and tell people about it and

2072
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:25,590
educate people as to what it is and
people are gonna feel how they're gonna

2073
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:27,160
feel.
But at the end of the day,

2074
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,650
I mean,
nothing's going to change with us

2075
01:23:29,651 --> 01:23:32,200
either.
How did you go from being a guy who is

2076
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:35,650
obsessed with being the best hunter you
could possibly be and wanting to be the

2077
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:38,470
best hunter in the world?
How'd you go from that to working for a

2078
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,720
Sitka and apparel company,
a hunting company,

2079
01:23:40,721 --> 01:23:42,910
and then going to kill you?
Well,

2080
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:43,960
I,
uh,

2081
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,030
so after I killed a big elk,
I was in,

2082
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,820
I started writing some stories and like,
like I told you,

2083
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:49,120
I mean,
I,

2084
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,110
I,
I really,

2085
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:52,120
you know,
there's a lot of guys that get

2086
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:54,760
something,
have a great stroke of luck in life and

2087
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:58,180
all of a sudden they killed one big
thing or they win one small lottery or

2088
01:23:58,181 --> 01:23:58,871
whatever and,
and,

2089
01:23:58,871 --> 01:24:00,100
and the,
you never hear from again.

2090
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,570
And that was like the,
you know,

2091
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,600
growing up in a hunter like to kill this
huge elk was yeah,

2092
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:07,750
it was the right place at the right time
and amazing thing for me.

2093
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,930
But I was,
I think time super conscious that I

2094
01:24:10,931 --> 01:24:12,520
don't want to be a one hit wonder.
I mean,

2095
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:15,160
I want to do it more.
I want to be really good at what I'm

2096
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:15,581
doing.
I mean,

2097
01:24:15,581 --> 01:24:18,360
like I grew up reading,
hunting books and like the,

2098
01:24:18,361 --> 01:24:20,600
the best hunters in the world.
I wanna I wanna,

2099
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,450
I wanna I wanna get you then this title.
Yeah,

2100
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:24,970
exactly right.
I want to keep the strap after every

2101
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:25,631
year.
Right on.

2102
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:26,830
So,
um,

2103
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:27,730
I just,
you know,

2104
01:24:27,820 --> 01:24:30,220
put the work in and then it's doing some
writing.

2105
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:32,090
I was at a trade show when I met him and
I,

2106
01:24:32,091 --> 01:24:33,850
I didn't work at sick.
I was a first,

2107
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:35,560
uh,
they had an athlete team and one of the

2108
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:38,620
first for first year,
not really an athlete team.

2109
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:39,301
Yeah,
whatever,

2110
01:24:39,301 --> 01:24:42,580
whatever,
whatever pro staff we were talking about

2111
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:43,360
them,
the phone and it's,

2112
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:47,260
it's a weird term today because of this
sort of buy a hat that says like pro

2113
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:49,840
staff.
The franchise is completely dead.

2114
01:24:49,841 --> 01:24:52,600
I mean like I said,
pro staff with everything.

2115
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,620
It's like when you can buy a hat that
says that it's,

2116
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:55,860
it's dead.
I mean it means,

2117
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,890
it means nothing.
It's,

2118
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,490
it's been,
but back in the day it was,

2119
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:05,200
I mean went back when print media and
like at one point in time it meant you

2120
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:09,220
were vouching for our product because
you used it and isn't the right to vouch

2121
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:10,054
for it.
Yeah.

2122
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:13,600
You had a can have the photos,
you have the accomplishments,

2123
01:25:13,601 --> 01:25:15,400
you've earned the right,
not so much today,

2124
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:19,120
you have,
you have the credibility to say this is,

2125
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:22,540
this is good stuff or not.
And not because you did social media

2126
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,220
reps,
but because you actually had been out

2127
01:25:24,221 --> 01:25:26,020
there using it and you don't have big
stuff.

2128
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:26,980
Yeah.
And had the,

2129
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:30,160
had the track record.
So I met him at a trade show and uh,

2130
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:31,090
you know,
like I said,

2131
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:34,270
every now and again in life you have
something that's just right place at the

2132
01:25:34,271 --> 01:25:36,070
right time.
And I had killed that big elk and it

2133
01:25:36,071 --> 01:25:39,190
kind of was getting known and,
and I met him in the booth and he's

2134
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,720
like,
you're that kid that killed that big elk

2135
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:43,240
and exactly the same.
It's still does.

2136
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:45,100
Yeah.
And so we hit it off and I started

2137
01:25:45,101 --> 01:25:48,160
helping them test and gear and shot a
commercial for him down and stuff.

2138
01:25:48,161 --> 01:25:49,840
And we just became really good friends.
And then,

2139
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,150
um,
when the whole deal went down in Sitka,

2140
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,780
um,
he,

2141
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:55,120
you know,
it's like when your,

2142
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:57,670
when your guy,
your guy is,

2143
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:59,610
you know,
they're in,

2144
01:25:59,611 --> 01:25:59,981
in,
in,

2145
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:01,420
is leaving,
you know,

2146
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:02,320
you have a choice.

2147
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,160
You can either go with your guy or you
can,

2148
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,050
you know,
stay with,

2149
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,690
you know,
what's the best thing you think is to

2150
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:09,181
do.
And,

2151
01:26:09,181 --> 01:26:10,040
and I was like,
man,

2152
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,630
whatever you got going on next,
let me know.

2153
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,533
I'm,
I'm down.

2154
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:17,680
What did you think about this pursuit
that he's on to create the most finely

2155
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:20,840
engineered,
like to the extreme products?

2156
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:22,290
Like what he's doing?
It's,

2157
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:22,941
it's fine.
I mean,

2158
01:26:22,941 --> 01:26:24,830
he's,
he's hit everything on the head that he

2159
01:26:24,831 --> 01:26:25,451
told me.
I mean,

2160
01:26:25,451 --> 01:26:26,271
we,
we flew down,

2161
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:27,104
we went to,
uh,

2162
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:29,000
I flew down like,
I don't want to say it was like in

2163
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:30,610
November or something,
a year before he's,

2164
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,170
could you start at Ku?
He was already started,

2165
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:34,670
but beforehand,
and he,

2166
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,570
he basically is like nostradamus in
hindsight.

2167
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,201
I mean,
it was like,

2168
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:41,360
listen,
he breaks out this,

2169
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,640
I remember I'll never forget this
briefcase.

2170
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:46,100
And he pulled this thing out and it was
a carbon fiber frame and he's like,

2171
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,320
this is,
this is the backpack we're coming out

2172
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:50,870
with and the whole business model,
all of that.

2173
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:52,940
And it's like,
I'm not the smartest guy in the world,

2174
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:55,760
but when I meet a really smart dude
that's got a really good idea,

2175
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,770
you know,
I'm not that dumb.

2176
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:00,950
You smart enough to recognize smart
people.

2177
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:01,891
Yeah.
I was like,

2178
01:27:01,891 --> 01:27:02,391
and I was like,
man,

2179
01:27:02,391 --> 01:27:02,990
I don't,
I don't,

2180
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,500
yeah,
I mean you,

2181
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,730
when you see something and you go to,
I want to know more about that and that

2182
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:10,280
seems like it's going to fix a problem.
And uh,

2183
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:10,940
and just,
you know,

2184
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,580
the knowledge of what he,
what he knew about everything and you

2185
01:27:13,581 --> 01:27:15,110
know,
we were buddies and it's like,

2186
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:16,280
dude,
why wouldn't you want to go,

2187
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:18,800
you know,
work at a company?

2188
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:20,780
Where are you going to be able to hunt
as much as you want?

2189
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:23,600
You're testing gear and,
and I mean,

2190
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:26,450
truly live in the dream and not just
saying it like living the dream.

2191
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,030
Like,
you don't wake up every day and you like

2192
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:31,210
what you're doing and you know,
it's,

2193
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,330
it's,
it's been awesome.

2194
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:32,990
I mean,
that's,

2195
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:33,801
and so,
so yeah,

2196
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:37,370
he said he's been basically,
I'm looking for somebody to run this

2197
01:27:37,371 --> 01:27:39,980
part of it and um,
and it's like,

2198
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:41,540
he's like,
you'd be perfect.

2199
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:42,374
I'm like,
well,

2200
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,870
perfect.
Well I think people like you were

2201
01:27:44,871 --> 01:27:46,910
attracted to the pursuit of excellence.
Yeah.

2202
01:27:47,150 --> 01:27:49,000
And when you see the pursuit of
excellence in,

2203
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,180
in another form,
you go,

2204
01:27:50,181 --> 01:27:50,960
well,
there it is.

2205
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:51,330
Like,
well,

2206
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:55,040
that's how it is with me.
When I started seeing your company and I

2207
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:59,570
see a company that's trying to like
deeply and seriously engineer something,

2208
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:01,970
I Geek out on shit that I'm not even
interested in buying.

2209
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,990
Like if someone's making the craziest
grandfather clock in the world and I see

2210
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,610
this guy that's engineering these
things,

2211
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:12,200
so it's accurate to like one 18th of one
second over 20 years,

2212
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:13,280
I'm like,
ah,

2213
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,950
I want to,
I want to know what's going on this

2214
01:28:15,951 --> 01:28:19,220
dude's brain that makes them want to
make this unbelievable grandfather

2215
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:19,560
clock.

2216
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,180
Huh?
Like,

2217
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:22,970
I'm fascinated by pursuit.
You know,

2218
01:28:22,971 --> 01:28:25,510
when someone's trying to do something
better than the people that had done

2219
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:27,470
before it.
I'm fascinated by that.

2220
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:32,471
So he must've seen that for a guy like
you and I know what I know what I like

2221
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:36,560
and I know what I see a good idea.
Um,

2222
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:37,880
the one thing is like,
I'm not,

2223
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:42,320
I wouldn't say I'm necessarily the best
at doing like super intricate things are

2224
01:28:42,321 --> 01:28:45,200
knowing exactly how to get there,
but when you see somebody that knows how

2225
01:28:45,201 --> 01:28:47,630
to get there and like it'd be a good
combination and you can,

2226
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:50,360
you know,
assist in that in somebody that when

2227
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:51,570
they're headed on the,
on the,

2228
01:28:51,571 --> 01:28:53,000
on the right direction and it's like,
yeah,

2229
01:28:53,210 --> 01:28:54,170
I'm down with that.
And,

2230
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:55,430
and,
and then,

2231
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,560
you know,
I have my input on what we do,

2232
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:58,940
but you know,
at the end of the day it's,

2233
01:28:58,970 --> 01:29:00,110
you know,
a lot of it is,

2234
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,270
you know,
him,

2235
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:02,040
how he,
how he goes

2236
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,390
about stuff.
It's cool to watch.

2237
01:29:03,391 --> 01:29:03,950
I mean,
it's like,

2238
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:04,783
it,
it's,

2239
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:06,810
I,
I always tell people like at,

2240
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,230
at what we do is it is,
it's exactly what you think it is.

2241
01:29:10,231 --> 01:29:12,360
Like there's not like a,
you step in the room and it's like,

2242
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:13,890
oh yeah,
this is some other guy's stuff.

2243
01:29:13,891 --> 01:29:15,660
We're going to knock this out.
That's not going on.

2244
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,490
But that does happen in some companies.
And you,

2245
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:21,440
you were posting all this,
that's disturbing to me.

2246
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:25,050
When,
when you look at the future of this,

2247
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:27,780
what,
how far can you keep pushing this?

2248
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:31,920
I mean this is a fairly new thing that
people have been like ridiculously

2249
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:34,530
engineering,
hunting and outdoor equipment and

2250
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:39,710
obviously exists in the mountaineering
world and the Rei wise and you know,

2251
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:41,910
they,
they try every year trying to come up

2252
01:29:41,911 --> 01:29:43,530
with better and better stuff,
but how,

2253
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,930
how far can that go?
Like is there a point where you're going

2254
01:29:45,931 --> 01:29:49,230
to have it done?
Like this is the best backpack anybody

2255
01:29:49,231 --> 01:29:51,210
could ever possibly make.
These are the best clothes.

2256
01:29:51,211 --> 01:29:53,130
I mean,
is there a,

2257
01:29:53,131 --> 01:29:55,080
is there a point where that ends?

2258
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,820
You know,
today innovation is happening faster

2259
01:29:58,821 --> 01:30:03,821
than ever has and with those business
model we can implement those innovations

2260
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,670
quickly and we're always looking for the
next greatest thing.

2261
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:08,600
I always am.
I mean,

2262
01:30:08,601 --> 01:30:12,020
I searched the globe on a continuous
basis for what's new,

2263
01:30:12,021 --> 01:30:15,290
what's next,
aligned myself with the innovation

2264
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:17,870
leaders for every single category,
whether it's marina wool,

2265
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:21,500
whether it's leathers or whether it's
for our gloves or whether it's carbon

2266
01:30:21,501 --> 01:30:23,480
fiber for our bat,
our packs.

2267
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,940
Um,
we had our designer down at Stanford,

2268
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,330
the carbon fiber scientists down there
that's working on some leading edge

2269
01:30:29,331 --> 01:30:32,630
technologies around carbon fiber that
won't even get to market for a few

2270
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,700
years.
Were that interested in seeing what's

2271
01:30:34,701 --> 01:30:38,420
next because we can implement it because
we have no price restrictions.

2272
01:30:38,421 --> 01:30:40,600
When we take it away,
it's for us,

2273
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,730
it's,
it's a never ending pursuit and there's

2274
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,390
always new ways to make things and it's
why I tagged,

2275
01:30:46,690 --> 01:30:48,790
tagged the line for the business of
ultra light.

2276
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:53,270
Because if I can find a way to shave an
ounce or a gram,

2277
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:57,550
there's a reason to redo that product.
There's reason to reinvent that product

2278
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:02,580
because that makes a difference.
And that was my focus with this is that,

2279
01:31:02,890 --> 01:31:04,570
you know,
Tory's technology and how they make the

2280
01:31:04,571 --> 01:31:06,790
yarn carbon fiber,
it all led to ultra light.

2281
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,040
Ultra light means performance in the
mountains.

2282
01:31:09,041 --> 01:31:13,120
And so my goal is to get our weights
continuously to come down as far as our

2283
01:31:13,121 --> 01:31:16,510
product without giving up performance.
And that's through using really

2284
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:20,110
innovative technologies and designs that
are all focused around that.

2285
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,110
And I mean from where we started to
where we are now,

2286
01:31:23,111 --> 01:31:26,590
I mean we've taken pounds and pounds of
weight out of people's kits and packs

2287
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,430
and seeing the results.
And it's been amazing to watch people

2288
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:33,400
that normally would walk into the mounds
with the 70 pound back now leaving with

2289
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:36,340
a 40 pound pack and come back and sand
made all the difference in the world.

2290
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:40,660
I can hunt now and I thought I was done
because of pack weight.

2291
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:45,440
Now have you guys thought about
implementing any sort of a workout

2292
01:31:45,441 --> 01:31:49,250
routines or um,
or diet routines or things like that on

2293
01:31:49,251 --> 01:31:54,251
your website and it's sort of shaping
people's ideas about getting your body

2294
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,700
prepared?
I would like to do more of that,

2295
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:56,850
really would.
Um,

2296
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:59,830
we'd started developing our mountain fit
line come out next year.

2297
01:31:59,831 --> 01:31:59,980
So

2298
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,640
using all of our fabric innovations into
performance fitness line for our

2299
01:32:03,641 --> 01:32:07,120
customer because they're all training
for hunts and I have wanted to step in

2300
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:11,830
and help people get fit,
nutrition supplements and bring that to

2301
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:13,810
our customers as well.
We just haven't gotten there yet,

2302
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:17,110
but I think it's absolutely something,
I know I want to do it cause I live and

2303
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:18,550
breathe it everyday.
Just haven't done it yet.

2304
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,010
Don't you think that's also another
aspect that people don't realize,

2305
01:32:21,011 --> 01:32:24,970
like how much physical requirement is
necessary in order to to hunt.

2306
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,890
Like especially in mountain hunting,
elk hunting,

2307
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:28,840
you're going in the mountains of
Montana,

2308
01:32:28,841 --> 01:32:33,841
you're at fucking 9,000 plus elevation.
It's unbelievably difficult on the body.

2309
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:37,390
And I think most people don't realize
how much physical preparation is

2310
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:39,430
involved.
Especially you two guys,

2311
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:41,920
you wrestler,
you are former football player,

2312
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,630
you guys have athletic backgrounds.

2313
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:47,230
You know how physically demanding this
is the hardest things I've ever done.

2314
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:49,540
I've been hunting without a doubt.
And I mean like,

2315
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:51,460
it's hard to say.
There's tough,

2316
01:32:51,461 --> 01:32:54,400
that's stuff that's tougher than college
wrestling practices.

2317
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:55,960
Um,
I've definitely,

2318
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,561
you know,
I mean you,

2319
01:32:56,561 --> 01:32:57,850
you got,
you push it to limit,

2320
01:32:57,851 --> 01:33:00,250
especially on some of these long
expedition consonant.

2321
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:04,300
I spent 24 days backpacking in the Bob
Marshall last year to find a sheet to

2322
01:33:04,301 --> 01:33:05,680
find one ram.
And it's like,

2323
01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:09,160
until you've actually done that,
and I'm talking like it's not just,

2324
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:11,410
you know,
how far or how long,

2325
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:13,600
but it's sustained.
Um,

2326
01:33:13,740 --> 01:33:16,600
it's at a sustained high level of focus
also,

2327
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:17,710
which you don't like.
You can,

2328
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:21,820
you can grind away at stuff and you can
just go and go and go.

2329
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,720
But I mean,
again,

2330
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:25,060
when we get them,
we don't just go from a to b.

2331
01:33:25,061 --> 01:33:26,530
We have to be,
you know,

2332
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,990
you have to be on,
on point in the mountains too.

2333
01:33:28,990 --> 01:33:30,070
I mean,
you have to be sharp.

2334
01:33:30,100 --> 01:33:32,050
You gotta be ready to execute.
The moment comes,

2335
01:33:32,051 --> 01:33:35,020
you can't be just sort of trotting along
like a Zombie.

2336
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:35,651
Yeah.
I mean,

2337
01:33:35,651 --> 01:33:38,740
when you get up early in the morning,
if you're not glass and every single

2338
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:42,610
time with,
with the same enthusiasm and the same or

2339
01:33:42,611 --> 01:33:45,970
that your grid system or whatever,
you have to be as intense on day one as

2340
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:48,880
you do on the last day because you could
miss what you're looking for and you

2341
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:49,840
can't,
you can't let up.

2342
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:51,700
That's the beauty of it.
And I mean,

2343
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,290
yeah,
I mean physically fit.

2344
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,820
I mean,
there's lots of different stuff.

2345
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:55,654
I mean,
I've,

2346
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,270
you know,
he's got his whole training regimen and

2347
01:33:58,271 --> 01:33:59,290
you know,
everybody's different,

2348
01:33:59,291 --> 01:33:59,920
but,
uh,

2349
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,890
you know,
like whether it's yoga or you know,

2350
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,690
cardio and you know,
how much you're eating.

2351
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:05,431
And I mean,
it's,

2352
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:06,190
it's,
it's,

2353
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,340
it never ends you,
you,

2354
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:08,800
there is no magic bullet.

2355
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:09,671
The,
the puzzle,

2356
01:34:09,671 --> 01:34:11,560
you're always putting it,
you're always breaking it down and doing

2357
01:34:11,561 --> 01:34:13,280
a new puzzle.
Yeah,

2358
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:15,130
I do every year.
Yeah.

2359
01:34:15,131 --> 01:34:17,020
And,
and everyone has different physical

2360
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:19,930
requirements is some people that are
older and you just trying to kind of

2361
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:23,050
maintain the best possible shape they
get in.

2362
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:25,690
There's some guys that are younger.
We tried to get them into the ultimate

2363
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:28,270
fitness.
When you're training and you're doing

2364
01:34:28,271 --> 01:34:31,120
all these backpack things,
what you see you carrying weight it

2365
01:34:31,121 --> 01:34:32,620
using weight plates.
Like what do you,

2366
01:34:32,621 --> 01:34:34,300
what are you carrying around in a
backpack?

2367
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:37,900
So I use,
we have these sand bags that are set up

2368
01:34:37,901 --> 01:34:41,170
for putting over like the booms and our
video root cause now what I use,

2369
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:42,850
you can buy them in 20 pounds,
25 pounds,

2370
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:45,460
30 pound increments.
And that's what I put in my packet train

2371
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:47,210
with.
And so like right now as we're rolling,

2372
01:34:47,290 --> 01:34:50,950
we're about 45 days away from are a
sheep hunt in the Yukon.

2373
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:54,550
I'm really stepping up my weight.
So I'm training with a 90 pound pack now

2374
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:58,100
and I'll do a two or three hour hike,
1500 2000 vertical

2375
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,170
feet and on.
Now I'm doing it in the middle of the

2376
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:03,380
day with the heat we're having because
it adds another mental toughness factor

2377
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:03,951
to it.
Plus,

2378
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:06,740
as you know,
it adds a whole nother level of fitness

2379
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:10,190
to when you're trained in the heat.
So my goal is to try to train in

2380
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:12,890
situations with weight and conditions
that are harder than what I'll

2381
01:35:12,891 --> 01:35:16,660
experience in the hunt.
Just for the mental strength as much as

2382
01:35:16,661 --> 01:35:19,850
it as the physical part of it.
Because you get beat down on day three

2383
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:23,210
or day four and you just,
I've seen a lot of guys just fold in the

2384
01:35:23,211 --> 01:35:27,560
towel and say I've had it more go home
just physically they don't have anything

2385
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:28,670
left,
nothing left.

2386
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:30,590
Right.
So there's a mental side of it too.

2387
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:33,710
That's a big part of it that gives me
confidence when I'm going on these trips

2388
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:34,750
because it's,
I mean,

2389
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,930
they're fricking grinders.

2390
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:39,740
I mean I've had hunts where we walked
for three freaking straight days with 70

2391
01:35:39,741 --> 01:35:41,630
pound packs before you even start
hunting.

2392
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:45,140
That's just to get into the area from
the time you wake up until the time you

2393
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:47,810
go to bed.
And that can,

2394
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:50,930
you know,
most people can make the phone sat,

2395
01:35:50,931 --> 01:35:52,370
phone call and get picked up and taken
out.

2396
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:55,100
And we hear about it all the time from
clients and customers.

2397
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:57,080
So we try to help them get prepared
lower that way.

2398
01:35:57,081 --> 01:35:59,570
So that doesn't happen to them.
When you're doing something like that

2399
01:35:59,571 --> 01:36:00,770
and you're preparing for something like
that,

2400
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,670
do you start off with like 20 pounds and
like how do you,

2401
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:06,560
how do you do then?
How would you advise someone?

2402
01:36:06,561 --> 01:36:07,840
Like say if there's someone listening
right now,

2403
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:08,901
it says,
Hey,

2404
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:09,590
uh,
I'm,

2405
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:11,420
you know,
I'm going to go on a hunt this this

2406
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:12,320
winter or this,
uh,

2407
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:14,930
this fall rather,
and I need to really get physically

2408
01:36:14,931 --> 01:36:17,600
prepared but I don't want to blow it all
out in one shot.

2409
01:36:17,780 --> 01:36:19,370
Yeah,
you definitely want to build up to it.

2410
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,080
And because I don't stop training,
I come out of a hat on and go right back

2411
01:36:22,081 --> 01:36:24,050
at my training.
But for a lot of guys are just getting

2412
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,430
to ease into it.
Right?

2413
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:26,590
I mean,
you want us,

2414
01:36:26,630 --> 01:36:29,060
like you said,
start with 20 pounds and build yourself

2415
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:32,330
up over time because lastly we want to
do is go into hunt hurt,

2416
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:33,410
right?
I've done that before.

2417
01:36:33,411 --> 01:36:37,700
I've overtrained or done too much going
into hunt and you have to be careful,

2418
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:42,230
especially as you age I get sent tend to
get tendinitis and joint pain more than

2419
01:36:42,231 --> 01:36:43,940
I ever have.
And so it's,

2420
01:36:43,941 --> 01:36:47,660
it's managing your body through that
process and having something left when

2421
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:50,900
you leave and,
but being fit enough and having your

2422
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:53,170
feet and in good enough shape and your
boots broken.

2423
01:36:53,171 --> 01:36:57,590
I mean there's a lot to it besides just
the cardio part of it that goes into the

2424
01:36:57,591 --> 01:36:58,100
hunt.

2425
01:36:58,100 --> 01:37:00,650
Yeah,
I think people would benefit from seeing

2426
01:37:00,670 --> 01:37:02,780
what,
like if you could make like a blog on

2427
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:06,590
how you do it or get outline,
totally outline how you start off and

2428
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:10,250
how someone would build into it and
maybe consult with someone who's a,

2429
01:37:10,270 --> 01:37:13,480
an expert trainer and figure out what's
the best way to uh,

2430
01:37:13,730 --> 01:37:18,730
get people prepared to develop an actual
workout for like for pack hunting or for

2431
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:19,910
even hiking.
Any,

2432
01:37:19,911 --> 01:37:22,460
any,
any sort of thing where you're walking

2433
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,980
uphill in the mountains with weight on
your back.

2434
01:37:25,010 --> 01:37:26,150
It's like,
boy,

2435
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:29,540
that is an unbelievably difficult thing
to do all day,

2436
01:37:29,690 --> 01:37:31,730
every day for several days.
At a time.

2437
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:33,830
It's just a different biomechanical
movement.

2438
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:37,580
I used to trail run a ton beforehand and
that was enough and I've gotten older.

2439
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:41,630
I've realized that I need to train more
specifically for hunts and that's

2440
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:44,810
carrying a pack with weight and it hits
different muscle groups as you've felt.

2441
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,990
It gets more up in your hips and your
glutes and it hits a whole different

2442
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:50,630
muscle group.
Then trail riding does or that weight

2443
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:54,590
training does or training on an
elliptical stairmaster or whatever that

2444
01:37:54,591 --> 01:37:56,190
is.
There's no substitute

2445
01:37:56,190 --> 01:37:57,390
for spending time in the pack with
weight.

2446
01:37:57,391 --> 01:37:58,410
There's just isn't.
No,

2447
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:00,900
there's no sub.
It's so different than anything else.

2448
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:02,250
It just,
it's so exhausting.

2449
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:06,480
It is and it hits a whole different
muscle group and your heart and lungs

2450
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:08,790
may be in shape,
but those muscles aren't and it,

2451
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:10,110
it taxes you.
Yeah.

2452
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:13,350
As much as I lift weights and workout
and kettlebells and all this stuff,

2453
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:18,580
I packed hundred pounds for like three
quarters of a mile in the fall and I was

2454
01:38:19,501 --> 01:38:21,810
fucking dead.
I know when it was over I was like,

2455
01:38:21,811 --> 01:38:24,630
oh my God,
I can imagine 70 pounds on my back for

2456
01:38:24,631 --> 01:38:27,450
three days at a time.
Walking all day just to start hunting.

2457
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:29,640
Yeah.
I'm not in good enough shape for that.

2458
01:38:29,641 --> 01:38:32,760
So if someone listening to this,
is there a resource,

2459
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:35,790
is there any like sort of a website they
can go to that give them some good

2460
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:37,890
workouts for,
for something to get prepared for

2461
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:39,000
something like this?

2462
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,750
There isn't one specific to what we're
doing and I think it's a great idea that

2463
01:38:42,751 --> 01:38:44,640
you have is really laying that out and
we tee,

2464
01:38:44,650 --> 01:38:46,800
I mean we talk about all the time,
we take all this for fricking granted.

2465
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:48,280
Yeah,
we've grown up doing it right?

2466
01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:49,470
These spreadsheets,
people are like,

2467
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:50,490
oh my God,
that's so amazing.

2468
01:38:50,491 --> 01:38:52,410
You do that.
And like I've always done it right on

2469
01:38:52,411 --> 01:38:53,940
the house.
You knew what your pack's going away

2470
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,440
when that you're not over packing and
then you have exactly what you need and

2471
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,120
how much you need of it.
And we break it down to like calories

2472
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:03,870
per ounce and ounces per day.
As far as our food.

2473
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:04,670
We bring,
I mean,

2474
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:06,960
I'd go on a sheet and I don't rely on
the outfit or to the pack for me.

2475
01:39:06,961 --> 01:39:09,450
I bring all my own food and it's all
laid out.

2476
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:11,520
It's all,
it's all calculate out to the exact

2477
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:13,950
calorie per day I'm going to eat.
What kind of food do you bring?

2478
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:16,110
A lot of whole foods now.
I used to bring,

2479
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:17,760
you know,
lots of bars and clif bars and power

2480
01:39:17,761 --> 01:39:19,470
bars.
Now it's real food and,

2481
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:20,930
and I both gotten to that.
Yeah.

2482
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:24,270
Nuts and whole grains and,
and um,

2483
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:27,030
getting away from the edge.
I did meal so much at the have,

2484
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:27,871
you know,
high sodium,

2485
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:30,240
not a lot of nutritional value and
really trying to focus on,

2486
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,670
you know,
bring in breads and peanut butters and

2487
01:39:32,671 --> 01:39:37,080
cheeses and things that will stick with
you versus high sugars and you know,

2488
01:39:37,081 --> 01:39:38,360
quick burns,
right?

2489
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:42,810
When you have dehydrated food,
how nutritious is that stuff?

2490
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:46,110
I don't just scouring the Trisha,
I think his calories and then if you

2491
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:48,780
really look at their calories are not
that many calories per ounce.

2492
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:54,000
They're light and some of them have
higher calories per ounces than others.

2493
01:39:54,001 --> 01:39:56,160
But I,
Brendan's come up with a really good

2494
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:58,740
recipe with your,
with peanut butter and some noodles and

2495
01:39:58,741 --> 01:40:00,330
like Stephanie on,
you're really creative with it.

2496
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:01,890
I've been,
I've been kind of building my own,

2497
01:40:01,891 --> 01:40:06,891
like my stuff wasn't my id exactly.
If I've modified it a bit and a couple

2498
01:40:07,561 --> 01:40:10,110
of things,
ramen and peanut butter and fats and

2499
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:11,270
jerky and stuff,
all that,

2500
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:13,900
the heart weighs about the same and has
double the calories and,

2501
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,660
and you don't want,
the one thing I,

2502
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:18,420
this is what I do a lot is advising
people that are going on a big hunt,

2503
01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:20,610
you know,
and it's like start today,

2504
01:40:21,030 --> 01:40:22,500
don't put it off.
Don't get a plan.

2505
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,660
Like get a pack on,
go for a hike,

2506
01:40:24,661 --> 01:40:26,520
start working out right now.
You know,

2507
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:27,570
it's going to and,
and,

2508
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:29,280
uh,
get all your gear in order.

2509
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:31,860
And at the end of the day it's going to
be a grind.

2510
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,150
You're,
you're not gonna,

2511
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:35,310
you're not going to be full the whole
time.

2512
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,710
You're not going to have all the energy
and neat.

2513
01:40:37,711 --> 01:40:39,000
Like,
that's the beauty of it.

2514
01:40:39,001 --> 01:40:41,280
It's like you can train all you want to
do at the end of the day,

2515
01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:42,630
you're going to be working on the
deficit.

2516
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:46,310
You need to be sharp and you're just
going to have to grind through it and

2517
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:47,640
you have to be tough.
You know?

2518
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:49,830
That's the beauty of it.
You can't be a wimp and do this.

2519
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:52,590
So how do you figure out how much peanut
butter to bring?

2520
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:54,233
How does

2521
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,510
you can't bring enough,
right?

2522
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:56,650
So you gotta burn what?
I mean,

2523
01:40:56,651 --> 01:41:00,550
1,002 thousand calories an hour when you
can heavyweight to altitude.

2524
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,910
Is it really that much?
2000 calories an hour.

2525
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:05,650
You'll do a thousand calories on a
treadmill an hour.

2526
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:08,380
But is that,
is that even possible?

2527
01:41:08,381 --> 01:41:13,381
2000 calories an hour if you're hiking
for 12 hours at altitude with weight as

2528
01:41:13,391 --> 01:41:14,360
possible,
done it.

2529
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,660
It's why you lose a pound a day,
two pounds a day on these hunts.

2530
01:41:16,661 --> 01:41:18,310
If you,
if you're not in total shape going in,

2531
01:41:18,670 --> 01:41:21,010
which is your body's just burning off
one more than you're taking in,

2532
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:23,200
you're going to be a calorie deficit no
matter what.

2533
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:25,510
And that also puts you at a mental
deficit,

2534
01:41:26,350 --> 01:41:30,730
makes you mentally exhausted when your
body starts using all its resources to

2535
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:32,740
part of it.
The same feeling.

2536
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:36,280
You get cutting weight,
you get on a huge trip when you're

2537
01:41:36,281 --> 01:41:37,900
running out of food,
you're way back in there.

2538
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,780
It's just like you just got to dig deep.
Like how do you show up for practice

2539
01:41:40,781 --> 01:41:43,540
when you're cutting weight?
You just got to do it and you just got

2540
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:46,000
to dig deep and your body will,
your body responds.

2541
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:47,460
I mean,
the cool thing is your body responding

2542
01:41:47,490 --> 01:41:50,440
will eat what it needs to eat and you
just keep going.

2543
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,041
You know what I mean?
It's,

2544
01:41:51,041 --> 01:41:52,580
it's going to be the,
the,

2545
01:41:52,581 --> 01:41:54,880
the beauty of it.
It's never easy.

2546
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:55,751
I mean,
it's going to be,

2547
01:41:55,751 --> 01:41:56,770
it's going to be tough.
Well,

2548
01:41:56,771 --> 01:41:59,610
that's one of the things that's so
exciting about this is it is

2549
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,870
unbelievably difficult.
Pursues test man.

2550
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,210
Now if you're going like,
explain to me a hunt,

2551
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:06,330
like say if you're going to go on a like
a,

2552
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,340
a mountain goat haunt or a sheep hunt
where you know you're going to go into

2553
01:42:09,341 --> 01:42:12,220
very difficult terrain and you have x
amount of days,

2554
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,930
how do you pack for that?

2555
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,420
Like as far as food?
Yeah,

2556
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,680
two pounds a day,
two per day.

2557
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:21,400
And then you want to be range ranging
between 100 to 120 calories per ounce on

2558
01:42:21,401 --> 01:42:24,460
your food choices.
So I break it down.

2559
01:42:24,490 --> 01:42:26,480
Do you concentrate on,
um,

2560
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,860
vitamins?
Do you think about like I do,

2561
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:30,490
yeah,
I'll bring,

2562
01:42:30,490 --> 01:42:32,000
I'll bring supplements.
Um,

2563
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:33,400
I'll bring,
uh,

2564
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:34,600
you know,
uh,

2565
01:42:35,020 --> 01:42:37,300
whether it's um,
you know,

2566
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:42,160
electrolyte replacement tax or vitamins
and that type of stuff.

2567
01:42:42,161 --> 01:42:43,870
And then the other part of it's just
whole foods,

2568
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:46,420
making sure we max out that Kelly's
frowns high fat content.

2569
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:50,380
And then the other thing I tell you to
tell people is try it when you're not

2570
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:51,760
hunting.
Totally.

2571
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,650
You have to,
if you don't like it,

2572
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:58,060
you're going to hate it on the mountain.
Like one year about these new pro bars.

2573
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,230
If you tried to pro bar.
Yeah,

2574
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,570
I got those to kind of nasty after
awhile.

2575
01:43:01,810 --> 01:43:03,460
I mean there's a lot to it.
There's nuts and grains.

2576
01:43:03,461 --> 01:43:04,990
Yeah,
they're very filling and they're very

2577
01:43:04,991 --> 01:43:07,930
big and dense,
but triton one for 10 days or three of

2578
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,360
them a day for 10 days.
At the end of it,

2579
01:43:10,361 --> 01:43:12,850
you don't even want to eat it.
And so I've,

2580
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:16,090
I believe now for me at least,
and what I recommend to our customers is

2581
01:43:16,091 --> 01:43:20,290
bring food you like now that you love
and focus on that stuff versus trying to

2582
01:43:20,291 --> 01:43:22,930
get crazy on something new that you
haven't tried and thinking,

2583
01:43:22,931 --> 01:43:24,310
okay,
I'll go to rei and by all these

2584
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:27,250
different types of exotic bars and
that'll be my food source.

2585
01:43:27,310 --> 01:43:29,140
Dude,
before I was on a ketogenic diet,

2586
01:43:29,141 --> 01:43:30,790
I was eating like 10 of those pro bars a
day.

2587
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:31,870
So I don't know what you're talking
about.

2588
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:33,640
Well,
the peanut butter and chocolate ones.

2589
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:38,641
I fucking love those days when Jamie,
all the time I lived on him for 14 days

2590
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:40,060
in the mountains,
I couldn't,

2591
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:41,380
I,
if I ate another one,

2592
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,570
I'd throw,
you know that that expression find me

2593
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,740
the best looking woman somewhere.
There's a guy is tired of fucking

2594
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,980
a lot of it with the food is a you,
you,

2595
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,980
you got to try it out

2596
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,930
early.
You got to try it beforehand.

2597
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:54,980
I mean,
I tell people like if you,

2598
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:56,850
if you've never eaten mountain house,
I mean it's,

2599
01:43:56,970 --> 01:43:58,530
it is,
it's like second nature to us.

2600
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,040
I mean,
so much of that shit that it's like I

2601
01:44:01,041 --> 01:44:02,330
got,
I mean I got tell people mountain

2602
01:44:02,331 --> 01:44:03,320
houses,
dehydrated,

2603
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:05,920
freeze dried or freeze dried.
Yeah.

2604
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:08,750
Whether it's mountain house or,
I mean there's a million kinds of it,

2605
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:11,300
but I've gotten to where like I can only
eat a certain,

2606
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:14,240
some of them function better for me.
Like I don't like any of the red sauce.

2607
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:16,250
I don't like don't ever eat Chili Mac,
by the way.

2608
01:44:16,530 --> 01:44:18,830
Why just try?
It goes right through you.

2609
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:20,430
Yeah.
Your buddy when you're hunting was going

2610
01:44:20,431 --> 01:44:23,020
to be bummed you ate it.
But if you,

2611
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,670
if you've got somebody you're hunt with,
you don't like feed him Chili Mac.

2612
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:28,540
But if you've never had a hang time,
if you've never done it before and,

2613
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,860
and you know,
you all of a sudden you go on this great

2614
01:44:30,861 --> 01:44:32,470
big trip and you're stressed,
you know,

2615
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,220
and you're traveling and all this stuff
and all of a sudden,

2616
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:36,500
you know,
it's like throwing diesel into an

2617
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:37,550
unleaded car.

2618
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:39,140
I mean if you've never ran on that
before,

2619
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:40,700
you don't really know how you're going
to run on it.

2620
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:41,451
He,
that's what he got to do it,

2621
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:42,520
do it right.
You know,

2622
01:44:42,521 --> 01:44:43,910
and,
and a lot of people,

2623
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:46,460
you know in freaks him out.
You know what's the thing leaving the

2624
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:47,900
outfit?
It was cause you on a sheep hunt,

2625
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:49,140
they'll provide the food.
Right.

2626
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,570
But you don't know what they're going to
give you.

2627
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:53,340
They don't know what you are going to
like the always over pack.

2628
01:44:53,341 --> 01:44:54,710
You mean the food bags?
We'll hand,

2629
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:58,820
you'll be 40 pounds for 10 days when you
really need 20 pounds because they don't

2630
01:44:58,821 --> 01:45:00,680
know.
The last thing we want is a client that

2631
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:05,540
doesn't like what they have to eat or
runs out of food and so this is all part

2632
01:45:05,541 --> 01:45:07,160
of it.
And then part of it you may not like

2633
01:45:07,161 --> 01:45:11,570
what they provide you thing is super
interesting and I'm messing around with

2634
01:45:11,571 --> 01:45:15,830
that actually as we as we speak,
because the thought of being able to go

2635
01:45:15,831 --> 01:45:19,610
for 10 days with sustained energy while
you're burning your own fat.

2636
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:21,590
I mean that is,
that is like,

2637
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,840
I would say that's cutting it.
I'm messing around with that right now.

2638
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:26,060
That's why I got that mct oil and all
that stuff.

2639
01:45:26,061 --> 01:45:27,950
I'm going to,
I'm going to try that this fall to see

2640
01:45:28,160 --> 01:45:29,500
because I've been in places,
you know,

2641
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,310
and,
and it's kind of funny like I've had

2642
01:45:31,311 --> 01:45:35,030
times where you run out of food or you
have so little food that I think your

2643
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:38,090
body has switched over to where it's
just strictly absolutely.

2644
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:40,490
And then you feel fine.
Like it's like it just goes away.

2645
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:43,220
So we'll hunger goes away in some sort
of a weird way,

2646
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,070
and there's,
there's also a bunch of different people

2647
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:49,580
that are involved in this now that are
coming up with snacks and different

2648
01:45:49,581 --> 01:45:52,090
foods that you could take with you when
you're a,

2649
01:45:52,100 --> 01:45:54,050
that's one of the reasons why I wanted
to ask you guys what you're carrying

2650
01:45:54,051 --> 01:45:56,630
around,
but once your body's into Ketosis,

2651
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,550
you know,
then you just need high fat,

2652
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:00,770
high fat content foods,
and you've got to figure out how to keep

2653
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:00,890
them.

2654
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:01,670
Okay.
All right.

2655
01:46:01,670 --> 01:46:04,940
Keep them from going bad while you were
out there in the mountain,

2656
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,550
but almond butter,
things along those lines and bringing a

2657
01:46:07,551 --> 01:46:10,070
lot more of that than powerbars.
Yeah,

2658
01:46:10,071 --> 01:46:11,600
and peanut butter,
the probably peanut butters,

2659
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:14,630
most peanut butter you're going to get
is going to be loaded up with sugar and

2660
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:18,960
just you can even get the insulin spikes
are going to get the crashes when,

2661
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,590
when you talking about 20 pounds of
food,

2662
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,260
that doesn't seem like a lot.
If you tell me 20 pounds of food for how

2663
01:46:24,261 --> 01:46:27,830
many days for 10 to two pounds of food
today I talking to is our antiquing

2664
01:46:27,831 --> 01:46:29,210
already.
I'm panicking,

2665
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,710
I'm starving,
I'm going to start off.

2666
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:33,620
You've got to ration it out.
You got to ration it out.

2667
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:35,000
Yeah.
And I mean,

2668
01:46:35,001 --> 01:46:36,410
it's not like you're sitting around
like,

2669
01:46:36,440 --> 01:46:38,210
Oh man,
I'm ready to get something to eat.

2670
01:46:38,211 --> 01:46:39,044
I mean,
you're right.

2671
01:46:39,050 --> 01:46:40,710
You're doing stuff.
You're glassing it.

2672
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:41,481
Like,
I mean,

2673
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:45,180
it's just like,
here's the line as you're hungry to go,

2674
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,520
it's like going on a diet.
It's,

2675
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:47,191
it's,
it's,

2676
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:50,370
it's basically you're in the mountains,
but your meal prepped.

2677
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:52,260
Like there's your little meal,
you know,

2678
01:46:52,261 --> 01:46:54,750
it's like these guys that are slimming
down and be on these competent,

2679
01:46:54,751 --> 01:46:56,040
you know what it's like,
that's all you get.

2680
01:46:56,270 --> 01:46:58,350
And do you have them broken down into
packets?

2681
01:46:58,351 --> 01:47:00,240
We have,
I have broken down per day,

2682
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:04,620
so I have a Ziploc bag with my day.
And how big is,

2683
01:47:04,621 --> 01:47:06,270
it was a law clerk and it's about this
big,

2684
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:08,130
maybe it's not very big.
That's so crazy.

2685
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:09,100
Like,
and then you know,

2686
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:10,980
every day is broken down.
Exactly that way.

2687
01:47:10,981 --> 01:47:12,720
So what's nice about it as you get back
at night,

2688
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:15,570
you're exhausted.
You take your empty bag out that you ate

2689
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:17,010
all day,
that goes in the garbage,

2690
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:20,550
and then you pull your new one out of
your food bag and dump in your pack.

2691
01:47:20,551 --> 01:47:22,680
So there's no guesswork.
None can't be.

2692
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:25,500
And Are you eating this stuff like we
were talking about before you go out

2693
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:27,640
there or are you trying to live off that
for a few days?

2694
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:29,640
I try everything year round,
so if the new,

2695
01:47:29,641 --> 01:47:31,590
something new comes out or we learn
about something new,

2696
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:32,730
I'm trying to,
during my training,

2697
01:47:32,731 --> 01:47:34,680
I'm trying,
trying to in the off season to make sure

2698
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:36,030
I'm going to like it.
Have you ever,

2699
01:47:36,031 --> 01:47:36,601
uh,
there's,

2700
01:47:36,601 --> 01:47:40,200
or a new product that's out of this,
a friend of mine has put out,

2701
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:42,000
it's called phat fudge.
Have you heard of this?

2702
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:44,490
Nope.
It's a see pull up.

2703
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:48,660
Um,
I think it's p h a t fudge.com I think

2704
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:49,440
is her,
uh,

2705
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,730
the website,
which she sells it,

2706
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:53,940
but she's a,
or it might be Paleo chef.com,

2707
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,790
but she's a created this,
um,

2708
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,670
it's like a snack.
It's very nutrient date dance.

2709
01:47:59,671 --> 01:48:02,790
It's up to fudge that has mct oil in it.
Very low sugar.

2710
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:04,410
I think it's got like a little bit of
honey in it.

2711
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,150
Um,
but they're,

2712
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:08,580
they come in these small individual
packets.

2713
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:09,630
Dude,
I fucking live on,

2714
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:11,640
I got to try that.
It's fantastic.

2715
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:14,580
But that's the type of stuff that is so
powerful in the mountains.

2716
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:16,320
Yeah.
Because it's small packet.

2717
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:16,770
You,
you know,

2718
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:20,580
just rip the top off it and shove it in
your mouth and chew it down.

2719
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:21,690
And uh,
you know,

2720
01:48:21,691 --> 01:48:23,670
you can see,
you see all the ingredients are,

2721
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:27,440
it's key to genic and uh,
it's called got cow,

2722
01:48:27,570 --> 01:48:29,190
it's got Tumeric,
cinnamon,

2723
01:48:29,191 --> 01:48:32,730
sea salt,
Maka honey grass fed butter.

2724
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:35,520
It's all like super,
super good stuff.

2725
01:48:35,521 --> 01:48:36,450
But it's,
you know,

2726
01:48:36,451 --> 01:48:38,340
a lot of calories for like a little tiny
thing,

2727
01:48:38,341 --> 01:48:41,940
but very nutrient dense.
And for someone who's trying to burn off

2728
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:44,340
nothing but fats,
it's a good way to go.

2729
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:45,390
It is.
Yeah.

2730
01:48:45,391 --> 01:48:45,920
The whole,
the,

2731
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,160
the concept of burning fat versus using
sugars was introduced to me.

2732
01:48:50,161 --> 01:48:52,770
We're doing some vo,
two Max testing and weight with our

2733
01:48:52,771 --> 01:48:55,140
packs on at a UC Davis performance lab.

2734
01:48:55,650 --> 01:48:57,060
And that guy trained,
uh,

2735
01:48:57,090 --> 01:49:01,120
worked with us cycling team and they
were talking about this movement into

2736
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:04,020
burning fat versus using gel shots and
sugars.

2737
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:06,210
Yeah.
And I've started to,

2738
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:09,120
in our diets and what we bring,
that's been our focus and this made a

2739
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,610
really big difference.
It's made a big difference with me.

2740
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:12,900
Uh,
it's made a big difference with a lot of

2741
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:15,840
UFC fighters.
Misha tate switched over to a Kesha,

2742
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:18,030
Jen tita genic die before she won the
title.

2743
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,560
Brian Caraway,
her boyfriend,

2744
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:22,110
he's on it too.
He said weight cutting is way easier as

2745
01:49:22,111 --> 01:49:24,930
performance levels are higher.
And one of the things that I'm finding

2746
01:49:24,931 --> 01:49:28,650
with myself and with a lot of my friends
have gone on as your testosterone goes

2747
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:30,540
up noticeably,
and some guys,

2748
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:33,840
it's going up by double real.
It's because the precursors for

2749
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:35,460
testosterone,
it's all about,

2750
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:36,510
it's all about fats.

2751
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:39,000
It's all about your body turns,
fats,

2752
01:49:39,120 --> 01:49:43,200
saturated fats and cholesterol,
all that stuff that you were eating from

2753
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:46,710
healthy fats turns that into hormones.
That's like what it,

2754
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:48,380
and it's one of the,
the,

2755
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:51,520
the big problems with going on high
carb,

2756
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:55,960
low fat diets is that your body has a
difficult time creating hormones through

2757
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:56,794
that.
I didn't know that.

2758
01:49:56,950 --> 01:50:00,220
Really interesting and new stuff that's
coming out is if these guys that are

2759
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:02,500
taking it,
they're finding that when they're doing

2760
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:05,470
their blood tests that their
testosterone levels are higher,

2761
01:50:05,471 --> 01:50:08,380
their growth hormone levels are higher.
It's really interesting stuff.

2762
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:13,590
Like I think your body is designed to
eat that natural food like plants and

2763
01:50:14,291 --> 01:50:16,240
vegetables and meats.
It is,

2764
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:17,950
you watch a bear.
What eats first?

2765
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:20,400
All the fat fish.
Oh yeah.

2766
01:50:20,401 --> 01:50:21,640
He needs to meet.
Yup.

2767
01:50:21,910 --> 01:50:24,880
I mean that's the number one food
source,

2768
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:26,770
energy sources,
fat first.

2769
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:29,200
I mean it's a wonderful thing.
It's just for,

2770
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,090
for whatever reason,
our society society,

2771
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:33,010
that's what makes people fat is really
the sugars.

2772
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,070
Yeah.
It's a sugar.

2773
01:50:34,180 --> 01:50:37,660
It's 100% of the sugars.
This stuff changes all the time.

2774
01:50:37,661 --> 01:50:41,560
And if you go back five years ago and
you read some of the studies that are

2775
01:50:41,561 --> 01:50:46,090
done and what people recommend like for
as far as diet now today it's totally

2776
01:50:46,091 --> 01:50:47,380
contrary to that.
It is,

2777
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:48,540
it's interesting how this,
the,

2778
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:51,910
the edge is always moving.
It's a cutting edge of this stuff is

2779
01:50:51,911 --> 01:50:53,080
always,
it's always changing.

2780
01:50:53,081 --> 01:50:57,400
And people were always coming up with a
new studies that show better ways to

2781
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:59,320
eat.
And that's the fun thing about what

2782
01:50:59,321 --> 01:51:00,730
we're doing is we're,
you know,

2783
01:51:00,731 --> 01:51:02,920
we're always there.
There is no magic bullet.

2784
01:51:02,921 --> 01:51:04,840
I got guys call all the time like,
Hey,

2785
01:51:04,841 --> 01:51:06,130
what,
what jacket do I need?

2786
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,410
It's like dude,
it doesn't look like that.

2787
01:51:09,190 --> 01:51:10,510
Clear small,
what is the name?

2788
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:14,970
What does this mean?
Island in southeast Alaska ties density

2789
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:19,000
of black bears in the world.
And I've handed it and it wasn't dot

2790
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:23,290
comed and I just liked the way the name
lays out.

2791
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:25,750
I like the way the balance,
the look and when I was hunting it,

2792
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:29,530
and this is when I had Sitka is hunting
there with my ex business partner and

2793
01:51:29,531 --> 01:51:34,531
actually gortex before they had licensed
us and invested in us and woke up the

2794
01:51:34,611 --> 01:51:37,250
morning before everybody else is sitting
on the back of the button and I like

2795
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:38,800
thinking about Kuya the name and I was
like,

2796
01:51:38,801 --> 01:51:40,000
that's one of the name of the next
company.

2797
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:45,540
And I don't know why that even came to
my mind because we're in the midst of

2798
01:51:45,551 --> 01:51:48,280
buildings that could,
but I just liked the name for whatever

2799
01:51:48,281 --> 01:51:50,050
reason,
just my gut told me that was it.

2800
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:51,850
Go with the gut.
Totally.

2801
01:51:51,970 --> 01:51:53,320
Always.
Every time.

2802
01:51:53,410 --> 01:51:54,600
Every time.
Yeah.

2803
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:57,220
Isn't amazing when you follow it,
how powerful it is.

2804
01:51:57,250 --> 01:51:59,530
It's my whole life I've always gone with
my gut.

2805
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:00,671
Totally.
Yeah.

2806
01:52:00,671 --> 01:52:01,450
It's,
there's no,

2807
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:02,860
there's no other way.
You know,

2808
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:05,200
so many people are,
are driven or,

2809
01:52:05,201 --> 01:52:08,320
or the,
her entire life is about fear and it

2810
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:12,130
dictates everything they do versus
following your gut and putting the fear

2811
01:52:12,131 --> 01:52:14,800
of side.
And once you do it makes all the

2812
01:52:14,801 --> 01:52:16,750
difference in life.
If fear is good,

2813
01:52:17,140 --> 01:52:19,210
it is a motivating factor.
Yeah.

2814
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:23,020
Well it's also the lack of fear can be
very dangerous.

2815
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:23,940
Absolutely.
One of the,

2816
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:26,710
one of the things that I would say like
people that are not scared when they're

2817
01:52:26,711 --> 01:52:29,020
fighting,
like those two people are in trouble.

2818
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:29,741
You're in trouble,
man.

2819
01:52:29,741 --> 01:52:31,480
You should be fine.
It nobody likes to be scared.

2820
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,000
But when I was competing,
the worst tournament's that I ever

2821
01:52:34,001 --> 01:52:35,800
fought in,
I was not nervous.

2822
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,460
It was too confident and I've,
I just perform poorly.

2823
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:42,910
But when I was fucking terrified and
like completely on edge,

2824
01:52:42,940 --> 01:52:45,770
then your body's just,
it's just primal.

2825
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,130
It's

2826
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:50,930
just like you get down to that,
that the bare minimum amount of

2827
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:54,610
understanding of what,
what you have to do of the thinking,

2828
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,510
the,
the rest of the world fades away.

2829
01:52:56,720 --> 01:52:58,670
And all you're thinking about is that
task.

2830
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:02,540
Do you cutting out everything else?
There's no thought about bills.

2831
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:06,110
There's no thought about the future.
There's just what's going on in front of

2832
01:53:06,111 --> 01:53:07,040
you right now.
And when,

2833
01:53:07,110 --> 01:53:10,520
if you can get down to that,
that's when you perform at your best.

2834
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:12,500
But it's fucking terrifying.
So nobody likes it.

2835
01:53:12,710 --> 01:53:16,070
Nobody likes to be like,
when you see guys that are in like the

2836
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:18,140
UFC that are like,
like,

2837
01:53:18,350 --> 01:53:20,630
here's a good example now I'm a big fan
of Luke rockhold.

2838
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:22,390
I think he's an awesome guy.
Just talking about on the way down,

2839
01:53:22,391 --> 01:53:25,520
he was way too relaxed the time he was
going to kill Michael Bisping.

2840
01:53:25,740 --> 01:53:29,770
Michael bisping fought that fight like
he was going in against a fucking silver

2841
01:53:29,771 --> 01:53:30,604
back gorilla.

2842
01:53:30,770 --> 01:53:33,080
He was terrified or not terrified,
but you know,

2843
01:53:33,081 --> 01:53:37,370
jacked up with nerves and like you're
always on the line for him and that's

2844
01:53:37,371 --> 01:53:38,390
how you walked.
Knocked him out.

2845
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:42,020
Such a great sport because first knock
out too in the UFC,

2846
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,790
it's this first Kale like that.
That's how I sell them on the way to

2847
01:53:44,920 --> 01:53:49,540
like Jorge Rivera in Manchester and kind
of get beat down mayhem.

2848
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:51,780
Miller as a Tko.
But the,

2849
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:53,690
the Tkos.
Yeah,

2850
01:53:53,691 --> 01:53:56,000
I mean he's also sitting down and his
punches better.

2851
01:53:56,001 --> 01:53:59,060
Jason Parillo,
his boxing coach has really been working

2852
01:53:59,061 --> 01:54:03,080
with him and d done a fantastic job with
him and with Cris Cyborg and a bunch of

2853
01:54:03,081 --> 01:54:07,790
other people that you build up to.
That reminded me of Keith Jardine

2854
01:54:07,791 --> 01:54:10,120
talking about Houston Alexander.
It was like,

2855
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:11,300
I kept thinking like,
man,

2856
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:14,600
he's really dismissive.
Like even in my league and all that

2857
01:54:14,601 --> 01:54:16,910
stuff and all of a sudden you're done.

2858
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:20,300
You can't,
when a guy's a professional fighter,

2859
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:22,640
if you just stood there and let him
punch you in the face,

2860
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:23,630
would it knock you out?
Yeah,

2861
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:24,381
absolutely.
Okay,

2862
01:54:24,381 --> 01:54:26,580
so that it can fucking happen.
They kind of,

2863
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:29,060
yeah,
and the last thing you want to be is the

2864
01:54:29,061 --> 01:54:30,620
guy that says,
this guy can't beat me.

2865
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:31,970
I'm going to go in there and fuck them
up.

2866
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:33,920
And then you wake up with a flashlight
and your eyes like,

2867
01:54:33,921 --> 01:54:35,090
what?
What's going on?

2868
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:36,500
The Dr. Santiago,
we don't move.

2869
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:37,700
You're like,
oh shit.

2870
01:54:37,970 --> 01:54:41,240
What happened motherfucker?
And then you have to deal with that.

2871
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:46,241
That ego that allow the ego tells you
that it's going to protect you from all

2872
01:54:46,341 --> 01:54:46,881
this,
you know,

2873
01:54:46,881 --> 01:54:49,220
do the baddest motherfucker have,
you don't have to worry about shit.

2874
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:50,540
Ooh,
I don't even have to worry.

2875
01:54:50,541 --> 01:54:53,000
And then blam and you're like,
God dammit.

2876
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,863
Ego.

2877
01:54:54,590 --> 01:54:55,580
Ego leaves you alone.
Like,

2878
01:54:55,581 --> 01:54:56,860
where are you now bitch?
He goes,

2879
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,820
it's okay to say it.
Just don't believe it.

2880
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:00,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

2881
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,680
And even if you say it,
he's got to be real fun.

2882
01:55:03,420 --> 01:55:04,760
Yeah.
You gotta be looking at her saying it

2883
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:05,960
too.
These guys are killers.

2884
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:07,221
I mean,
I just,

2885
01:55:07,221 --> 01:55:08,510
man,
that sports awesome.

2886
01:55:08,780 --> 01:55:13,040
It's a crazy sport is Brendan's got me
into it and I never missed a fight.

2887
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:14,870
Now have you come live yet?
I have.

2888
01:55:15,260 --> 01:55:17,810
Where have you been?
To live and to the Thompson Hendrix.

2889
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:20,240
I've been at like 25 of them that he was
at Thompson Hendrix.

2890
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:22,150
Nice.
Lorenzo Fertitta.

2891
01:55:22,151 --> 01:55:25,110
His nephew owns go hunt.
Yeah.

2892
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:26,470
Yeah.
So the runs in our buddy.

2893
01:55:26,471 --> 01:55:28,190
So he took me,
we got full access.

2894
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,450
Oh,
that was beautiful.

2895
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:30,980
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

2896
01:55:30,981 --> 01:55:33,900
The big ones coming up next weekend
you'll see 200 is alive.

2897
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:35,060
Oh yeah.
Man on TV.

2898
01:55:35,100 --> 01:55:35,780
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2899
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:36,613
I was like,
wait,

2900
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:38,750
I need a bill to hear Rogan so I know
what's going on.

2901
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:39,920
Well,
they have these little things,

2902
01:55:39,921 --> 01:55:43,260
these little radios that you can get at
the concession stand.

2903
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,123
Can you really?
Yeah.

2904
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:46,470
Most of that.
Most arenas have them now.

2905
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:48,870
And you take these little radios and
you,

2906
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:52,140
you turn them on and it actually has a
frequency that picks up the commentary.

2907
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:52,951
Really?
Yeah.

2908
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:54,180
It's excellent.
It's really cool.

2909
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:55,260
I missed that part.
Yeah.

2910
01:55:55,470 --> 01:55:56,730
Well there's sometimes something's going
on.

2911
01:55:56,731 --> 01:55:57,790
You don't know what happened.
Yeah.

2912
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:59,400
And like,
like they stopped the fight.

2913
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:00,211
Like,
why'd they stop the fight?

2914
01:56:00,211 --> 01:56:00,841
You don't realize,
oh,

2915
01:56:00,841 --> 01:56:02,460
he's fucking legs broken or,
yeah,

2916
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:03,810
exactly.
You can takes a while.

2917
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:05,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2918
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:07,170
Commentary.
And it also,

2919
01:56:07,171 --> 01:56:08,940
uh,
I believe you can get,

2920
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,950
I'm not sure about that.
There might just be fight pass.

2921
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,260
One of the cool things about UFC fight
passes,

2922
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:14,580
you can listen into the corners.

2923
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:15,390
Oh,
you can?

2924
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,740
Yes.
The corner guys are miked up,

2925
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:18,930
so you can,
you can hear like someone saying,

2926
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:19,741
Oh,
you know,

2927
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:21,210
his hands broke,
or Oh,

2928
01:56:21,211 --> 01:56:21,930
you know,
uh,

2929
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:23,860
this is what you gotta do.
Yeah,

2930
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:25,440
yeah.
You just get,

2931
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:29,880
you get insight and you also get a sense
of a building up anticipation.

2932
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:32,940
Like if you know that a guy's got an
injury and then he's trying to gut it

2933
01:56:32,941 --> 01:56:34,650
out,
it makes it even more exciting to watch.

2934
01:56:34,670 --> 01:56:35,420
You know?
I mean,

2935
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:36,630
yeah,
it's an awesome sport.

2936
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,350
Like I said,
I only have a couple of hobbies watching

2937
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,250
mma,
hunting.

2938
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:42,141
That's it.
And then they're,

2939
01:56:42,141 --> 01:56:42,961
they're very,
it's very,

2940
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:44,190
they're very comparable,
like,

2941
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:46,050
you know,
from going from being a wrestler.

2942
01:56:46,051 --> 01:56:46,600
I mean,
he,

2943
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:47,433
I mean,
it's just,

2944
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:50,040
it's exciting.
It's slow portions of nothing in this

2945
01:56:50,041 --> 01:56:51,840
training and grinding and all of a
sudden,

2946
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:54,390
and then every now and again you get to
step in and,

2947
01:56:54,540 --> 01:56:55,290
and,
and,

2948
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:56,190
and see where you're at.

2949
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:56,631
I mean,
it's,

2950
01:56:56,631 --> 01:56:57,390
it's,
it's,

2951
01:56:57,390 --> 01:56:59,070
you know,
like you always say like two guys.

2952
01:56:59,071 --> 01:56:59,550
I mean,
that's,

2953
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:02,130
that's a stripped down to the gets.
You either win or lose at 50 50.

2954
01:57:02,131 --> 01:57:04,560
I'm either going to win or I'm not.
And same with hunting.

2955
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:06,510
I mean at at certain point in time in
that hunt,

2956
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,800
you either you either get them or you
don't like the percentages work out like

2957
01:57:10,801 --> 01:57:11,670
that.
I mean it's,

2958
01:57:11,671 --> 01:57:13,080
that's,
that's the cool thing about it.

2959
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:15,240
Well I think also like hunting,
it's very,

2960
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:18,720
it's not perceived correctly by a lot of
people.

2961
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:22,050
It was very misunderstood and a lot of
people think of it as this barbaric,

2962
01:57:22,051 --> 01:57:26,460
awful thing involving bullies and
assholes when really they're incredibly

2963
01:57:26,461 --> 01:57:29,220
intelligent,
difficult people were pursuing one of

2964
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:32,130
the most,
one of the most difficult things to do

2965
01:57:32,131 --> 01:57:35,970
with dire physical consequences.
If you fail those bullies and assholes,

2966
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,440
they don't have the dedication to get
there.

2967
01:57:37,470 --> 01:57:40,110
Those aren't the real guys.
Well they don't have the understanding

2968
01:57:40,111 --> 01:57:43,470
of who they actually are.
The two do in order to face your own

2969
01:57:43,471 --> 01:57:44,880
fears,
like a lot of the bullies in the

2970
01:57:44,881 --> 01:57:48,630
assholes,
like you can get a certain distance with

2971
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:50,970
that,
with physical power and genetic

2972
01:57:50,971 --> 01:57:53,370
attributes.
I mean some guys just hit fucking hard

2973
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:57,240
and they're just good at taking a shot.
And if you stand in front of them,

2974
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:59,430
whale with them,
they might catch you and knock you out

2975
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:01,500
and beat your ass and you just got beat
by a bully.

2976
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:06,660
But the reality is when those guys get
to a steep emile chick or Cain Velasquez

2977
01:58:06,661 --> 01:58:09,030
or you know,
the best of the best,

2978
01:58:09,180 --> 01:58:10,470
they're going to get fucked up.
Yeah.

2979
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:14,220
Because those guys are just as just as
physically strong just as kate,

2980
01:58:14,221 --> 01:58:16,590
but also have their mental shit in
order.

2981
01:58:16,690 --> 01:58:19,380
They have their ego in order,
they have their understanding in order.

2982
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:24,040
And those guys are some of the nicest,
most down to earth people you ever going

2983
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:26,610
to meet because they get their ego
checked on a daily basis.

2984
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:29,220
Every one of my met,
we have some guys that are customers of

2985
01:58:29,221 --> 01:58:29,940
ours.
Um,

2986
01:58:29,940 --> 01:58:34,410
Tj and Mendez and I mean they're really
sharp guys.

2987
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:37,830
Very Sharp and very nice,
very polite,

2988
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:40,230
not assholes.
Very thoughtful.

2989
01:58:40,231 --> 01:58:42,010
I mean just great people to be around.

2990
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,710
And they also recognize that same thing
in hunting.

2991
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:45,191
They do.
You know,

2992
01:58:45,191 --> 01:58:49,750
Tj and Chad are gigantic hunt in chat
libs for it.

2993
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:53,800
He wants to do that.
Like now on most really good athletes

2994
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:55,840
that you would come across that are hot.
I mean like that's,

2995
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:59,560
that's like their second passion.
I love doing tons of baseball players

2996
01:58:59,561 --> 01:59:02,140
and football players and I mean cause
like man,

2997
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:04,270
what the intensity.
The same,

2998
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:05,940
you get the same drug out of it.
Yeah.

2999
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:06,940
This DNA,
right?

3000
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,400
I mean those guys,
same guys were the hunters of the tribe,

3001
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:10,780
right?
Are the athletes.

3002
01:59:10,840 --> 01:59:11,621
Yeah.
And it just,

3003
01:59:11,621 --> 01:59:13,870
it's a natural natural deal.
We had a,

3004
01:59:14,140 --> 01:59:16,210
Carson Palmer is a customer of ours and
he had never,

3005
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:17,980
it's Kinda like you never been hunting
before.

3006
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:21,280
Carson Palmer is a quarterback for the
cards.

3007
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:23,050
I literally don't follow any other
sports.

3008
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,150
That's awesome.
I can tell you everything you want to

3009
01:59:25,151 --> 01:59:30,040
know about mma or kickboxing or,
I love a narrow focus now I'm all about

3010
01:59:30,041 --> 01:59:31,060
narrow folk apparently.

3011
01:59:31,060 --> 01:59:33,190
Yeah.
So Carson won a thing called the heisman

3012
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:34,720
trophy.
I heard about that.

3013
01:59:34,721 --> 01:59:37,240
Jamie told me about that.
It's this metal trophy thing that you

3014
01:59:37,241 --> 01:59:40,300
get for playing football in college.
And then he's the quarterback for the

3015
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:43,000
now of the cardinals.
But then he was Cincinnati and he had a

3016
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:46,120
guy on the team that took them hunting
during a off during one of their by

3017
01:59:46,121 --> 01:59:47,830
weeks,
put it up in a tree stand.

3018
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:49,840
He never been hunting before.
He grew up in Orange County like I did

3019
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,870
and he said the first time the deer
walked under a stand,

3020
01:59:52,871 --> 01:59:54,100
a buck,
he,

3021
01:59:54,101 --> 01:59:59,101
the adrenaline and the DNA of that
process took over and he is just a die

3022
01:59:59,631 --> 02:00:01,990
hard hunter now.
And it's all he wants to do.

3023
02:00:02,020 --> 02:00:03,730
When he,
when he's done playing football,

3024
02:00:03,731 --> 02:00:05,050
he,
he only wants a honey,

3025
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:07,120
he wants to invest in Ku use so it can
be involved with hunting.

3026
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,460
I mean,
it's just that happened for him like it

3027
02:00:09,461 --> 02:00:12,400
happened for you see,
it happens so much with athletes.

3028
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:17,370
We have Brent Burns plays for the game
called hockey hockey that's on the thing

3029
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:19,660
on ice with ice skates.
He actually,

3030
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:20,930
well it is water.
If they freeze it,

3031
02:00:20,931 --> 02:00:21,701
these water.
Right.

3032
02:00:21,701 --> 02:00:22,080
Yeah.
And,

3033
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:24,580
and he's the same way.
He just got into hunting and he is just

3034
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:26,530
like,
this is the most amazing thing.

3035
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:27,640
Yeah,
just DNA.

3036
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:29,060
It's intense.
It's,

3037
02:00:29,070 --> 02:00:31,390
it's,
it's unbelievably intense and again,

3038
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:33,250
incredibly rewarding.
I mean,

3039
02:00:33,251 --> 02:00:34,990
like when I go to the store and buy a
steak,

3040
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:36,130
there's no reward.
It's like,

3041
02:00:36,131 --> 02:00:36,911
oh,
this is delicious.

3042
02:00:36,911 --> 02:00:39,550
I can't wait to eat it.
That's not like,

3043
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:41,920
you know,
cooking up a deer backstrap that,

3044
02:00:41,921 --> 02:00:43,690
you know,
you had to get out of the mountains.

3045
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:45,160
Yeah.
I love your instagram posts of your elk

3046
02:00:45,490 --> 02:00:47,230
steaks with the Jalapenos.

3047
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:48,920
Yeah.
He'll be the next day.

3048
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:50,410
Yeah.
The next day I went and cooked it up

3049
02:00:50,411 --> 02:00:51,191
just like you did.
Oh,

3050
02:00:51,191 --> 02:00:54,490
do I sweat like a pig?
I got sweat pouring out of the top of my

3051
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:55,720
head.
Everybody's laughing at me,

3052
02:00:55,721 --> 02:00:57,490
but Mike,
it's so good.

3053
02:00:57,610 --> 02:00:59,320
Isn't amazing.
Oh Man.

3054
02:00:59,321 --> 02:01:00,370
With Jalapenos,
man,

3055
02:01:00,371 --> 02:01:02,620
if you tried it that way every way
possible,

3056
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:07,270
you can't.
I've had it raw to burn.

3057
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:09,430
Anything you can put on it.
Love it all.

3058
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:10,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

3059
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:13,900
It's the best meat you can ever eat and
my kids have been eating it for four

3060
02:01:13,901 --> 02:01:15,240
years now.
I have a six year old.

3061
02:01:15,241 --> 02:01:16,990
It's been eaten bear since she was
three.

3062
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:17,801
So awesome.
Yeah,

3063
02:01:17,801 --> 02:01:19,600
it's,
it's the healthiest food.

3064
02:01:19,650 --> 02:01:21,460
It's,
it feels better.

3065
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:23,710
It feels better when you eat it.
It really does.

3066
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:25,450
Well.
It's flat out better for you too.

3067
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:26,381
Yeah,
I'm,

3068
02:01:26,381 --> 02:01:31,330
and I'm really into pursuing the art of
cooking it in a bunch of different ways

3069
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:31,600
too.

3070
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,970
And that's another thing that I learned
from Rinella.

3071
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:36,310
I'm uh,
getting Hank Shaw who I think lives up

3072
02:01:36,311 --> 02:01:40,970
your way too.
And he's a wild game famous chef who's

3073
02:01:41,150 --> 02:01:46,150
turned to becoming a hunter because he
was interested in trying to prepare this

3074
02:01:46,641 --> 02:01:50,090
food and be more connected with food.
So then he started hunting and then

3075
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:50,840
using,
yes.

3076
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:55,700
He uses a lot of local ingredients to a
lot of like ingredients from the area

3077
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:58,210
where the animal actually lives.
It's really interesting too.

3078
02:01:58,940 --> 02:01:59,840
Yeah.
Do you cook?

3079
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,870
I barbecue.
That's it man.

3080
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:06,440
Style fire in me.
That's all I do.

3081
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:08,300
If I,
if I can't barbecue,

3082
02:02:08,301 --> 02:02:10,280
I don't wanna Cook it.
Well that's the best way anyway.

3083
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:11,143
It is.
You know,

3084
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:12,920
especially now,
it really is.

3085
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,540
Um,
but yeah,

3086
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,040
talking about chefs,
like Guy Fieri,

3087
02:02:16,041 --> 02:02:17,660
he's like a client of ours.
You know who he is.

3088
02:02:17,661 --> 02:02:18,140
Yeah,
sure.

3089
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:19,370
Yeah.
And so he's,

3090
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:22,640
he's actually become buddies with,
with Brendan because he likes to smoke

3091
02:02:22,641 --> 02:02:25,550
meat and cook me like you didn't and
we've got to shave his head.

3092
02:02:25,830 --> 02:02:26,663
Yeah.
Right.

3093
02:02:27,060 --> 02:02:29,260
Cause it's not the eighties buddy.
He loves us.

3094
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:32,930
Frosted tips.
Got To go down holding down a hack that

3095
02:02:32,931 --> 02:02:34,910
stuff off.
We got a three yeah.

3096
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,000
Three haircuts for one this morning.
By the way,

3097
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:41,450
if you haven't noticed,
we got damn your haircut looks good.

3098
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:43,460
Thank you very much.
Locks of love.

3099
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:44,830
No hope here.
Yeah.

3100
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:47,640
Cause it gotta have to shave their head
too.

3101
02:02:47,780 --> 02:02:48,620
Yeah,
exactly.

3102
02:02:48,740 --> 02:02:49,520
Yeah.
Um,

3103
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,530
like chefs,
like Anthony Bourdain,

3104
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:55,190
he took me hunting in Montana recently.
We went on a pheasant hunt and uh,

3105
02:02:55,191 --> 02:02:56,024
you know,
he,

3106
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:00,110
he's a big fan of doing that as well as
cooking the animals.

3107
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:01,060
You know,
that he,

3108
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:05,330
he hunts himself and showing you how to
prepare it properly and he's done that a

3109
02:03:05,331 --> 02:03:08,030
bunch of times on his show and involved
in it.

3110
02:03:08,031 --> 02:03:09,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

3111
02:03:09,411 --> 02:03:11,270
It's fun.
It's actually fun to put different

3112
02:03:11,271 --> 02:03:12,950
Marinades,
put different recipes together.

3113
02:03:12,950 --> 02:03:13,910
I mean,
I throw it on the barbecue,

3114
02:03:13,911 --> 02:03:16,360
but there's a lot that goes into it.
And then also you know,

3115
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,620
something that people don't do.
I think enough of with wild game,

3116
02:03:18,621 --> 02:03:20,720
they wonder why it doesn't taste right.
It's proper aging.

3117
02:03:20,721 --> 02:03:22,400
Your meat.
I don't know if you'd do that with

3118
02:03:22,401 --> 02:03:24,560
yours.
I do sometimes,

3119
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:26,870
but most of the time I just cook it.
Yeah,

3120
02:03:26,871 --> 02:03:30,050
I mean it's better if you're agent,
you can do a quick age of your fridge.

3121
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:34,010
We put up like on a rack,
like a in like a pan or a plate with

3122
02:03:34,011 --> 02:03:37,100
like a wire rack that gets it off the
bottom of it and then put foil over the

3123
02:03:37,101 --> 02:03:40,190
top and let that blood drain out.
And how long do you age it for?

3124
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:42,560
I'll age backstrap for 10 days in my
fridge.

3125
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:44,540
Really?
And it is so much better.

3126
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,190
What does it smell like?

3127
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,680
It doesn't smell like anything really.
Nothing.

3128
02:03:48,830 --> 02:03:51,530
How come it doesn't stink after 10 days.
And your friends not rotting,

3129
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:53,600
it's just aging.
They do that with beef.

3130
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,980
Right.
But then the outside of it is all black.

3131
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:57,720
But that's what you're supposed to do.
You're,

3132
02:03:57,721 --> 02:04:00,200
you're cut off the outside edges and
that's what you do.

3133
02:04:00,220 --> 02:04:02,360
It'll trap as well.
What you'd do with any me.

3134
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:04,550
Yeah,
but that outside doesn't stink.

3135
02:04:04,670 --> 02:04:07,070
Nope.
It just gets dry and it actually builds

3136
02:04:07,071 --> 02:04:08,990
a crust.
You Trim off the crust and cook the

3137
02:04:08,991 --> 02:04:12,020
middle million times better.
What is the temperature that it has to

3138
02:04:12,021 --> 02:04:14,950
be at when you're doing that?
You can cook it medium to cook a medium

3139
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,110
rare.
I mean when you're the giants,

3140
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:18,950
if you're going to quick age,
it goes on your fridge.

3141
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:20,840
Just the normal frigerator temperature,
which is what,

3142
02:04:21,200 --> 02:04:22,850
I don't know,
36 38 degrees.

3143
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:26,510
But when they like dry age meat,
when you go to a like one of those

3144
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:28,840
shops,
similar temperatures,

3145
02:04:28,850 --> 02:04:31,610
my brother went to culinary school.
He's the one that taught me that real.

3146
02:04:31,650 --> 02:04:34,460
It was like you need to age your meat
cause you'll get all the blood out of

3147
02:04:34,461 --> 02:04:36,530
it.
The blood is what causes a Gamey or

3148
02:04:36,531 --> 02:04:41,100
flavor and also it also tend to rise as
your meat when you agent try it right?

3149
02:04:41,101 --> 02:04:44,550
Because you take a piece of back strap,
put it in the fridge with little bit of

3150
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,650
soy sauce and some brown sugar or
something on it.

3151
02:04:46,651 --> 02:04:47,830
I mean,
you're not eating sugar anymore,

3152
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,110
but if you do that,
it'll,

3153
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:53,580
I mean it's phenomenal.
I don't know if it would go bad.

3154
02:04:53,581 --> 02:04:55,110
It's never,
I've never left it long enough where you

3155
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:56,370
couldn't eat it.
But,

3156
02:04:56,371 --> 02:04:57,400
uh,
I mean I've,

3157
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:00,050
I've left a backstop for weeks,
weeks,

3158
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:00,800
weeks.

3159
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,870
It doesn't rot.
That's interesting,

3160
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,240
isn't it?
Does more sustainable because it doesn't

3161
02:05:06,241 --> 02:05:08,130
have all that fat on it.
Like a beef steak,

3162
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:09,630
the age beef.
Right.

3163
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:12,390
But do you do that?
And it just seems weird because people

3164
02:05:12,391 --> 02:05:13,360
don't do it,
but it's like,

3165
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:18,120
like a guy I know that big African Ph,
he'll take a whole hind quarter.

3166
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:20,280
Um,
the guy's name is Steve Colbert and he

3167
02:05:20,281 --> 02:05:21,690
told me this,
he'll take a whole hindquarter and put

3168
02:05:21,691 --> 02:05:24,570
his fridge in a fridge at his house for
30 days.

3169
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:26,250
And then it's the best.
It is.

3170
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:29,310
So a Ph for people don't know as a
professional hunter,

3171
02:05:29,311 --> 02:05:32,690
which in Africa is like a guide.
It is.

3172
02:05:32,730 --> 02:05:33,260
Yeah.
Yeah,

3173
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:34,650
yeah.
Do you know Steve Cabrini?

3174
02:05:34,860 --> 02:05:37,440
No.
So he's a bow hunter.

3175
02:05:37,650 --> 02:05:39,150
Really cool guy.
Big Guy.

3176
02:05:39,170 --> 02:05:40,980
Um,
he's basically killed everything in

3177
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:43,230
Africa with a bow.
I don't know that anybody else has ever

3178
02:05:43,231 --> 02:05:43,500
done it.

3179
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,830
Like this guy's the real deal.
It goes into the gnarliest places,

3180
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:50,010
but he takes,
takes people hunting over there and

3181
02:05:50,011 --> 02:05:50,880
stuff,
but almost,

3182
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:53,970
almost entirely a bow hunter himself
like stud and

3183
02:05:55,490 --> 02:05:56,150
you know,
I'll,

3184
02:05:56,150 --> 02:05:57,810
I'll introduce you to,
it's really cool.

3185
02:05:57,811 --> 02:06:00,110
Like everything and out.
No one's killed more animals in Africa

3186
02:06:00,111 --> 02:06:00,811
than him.
Everything.

3187
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:03,560
He's been everywhere to everything.
You know what?

3188
02:06:03,561 --> 02:06:05,440
Just think of the sink,
thinking of his meat,

3189
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:08,580
sit in the frigerator for 30 days.
It doesn't go bad.

3190
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:09,990
It's crazy.
Yeah.

3191
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:13,530
I mean it's a cover it in foil,
put a rack so the blood can drain out

3192
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:16,340
and they can sit there for,
it'll be a man.

3193
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:19,290
You'll be amazed at how long you can age
it and how good it is when you do.

3194
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:22,020
Is that the key?
Because I've had me sit in like a,

3195
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:24,990
like a bought a steak at a store and let
sit in my refrigerator for too long.

3196
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,610
Then you open up the meeting like,
oh,

3197
02:06:26,611 --> 02:06:29,480
it smells terrible.
That's already been age two and sitting

3198
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:30,321
on itself.
Right,

3199
02:06:30,321 --> 02:06:32,610
right.
And that is that the key that it has to

3200
02:06:32,611 --> 02:06:35,700
drain out of its blood.
And so you don't wrap it up.

3201
02:06:35,701 --> 02:06:36,840
Don't put it,
don't,

3202
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:40,670
don't contain it right underneath.
And then you can,

3203
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,670
the other way,
if you don't have a rack,

3204
02:06:41,671 --> 02:06:43,260
you can take,
I do as a bowl,

3205
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:44,213
right?
Or a pan.

3206
02:06:44,220 --> 02:06:47,970
I'll put foil over it and punch holes in
it so it's suspended in that blood and

3207
02:06:47,971 --> 02:06:50,090
go through those holes in the flow that
you put foil over the top,

3208
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:53,610
slide it in your fridge.
Did they sell like a rack for aging in

3209
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:55,230
your refrigerator?
Nurses by little,

3210
02:06:55,290 --> 02:06:58,950
they make little cooking racks that are
just like screens with that are designed

3211
02:06:58,951 --> 02:07:01,260
to go on a pan and get stuff off the off
of a pan.

3212
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:01,951
Know.
That's interesting.

3213
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:02,910
I'm going to,
I'm going to try that.

3214
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:03,744
You've got to try it.
Yeah.

3215
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,000
I haven't been doing that.
I just don't make a huge difference.

3216
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:08,040
I marinate sometimes.
You know what I like to do?

3217
02:07:08,041 --> 02:07:11,190
I have to take Newman's own Balsama
yeah,

3218
02:07:11,191 --> 02:07:13,140
just put it in that for a,
you know,

3219
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:15,200
five or six hours.
He was a great man.

3220
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:16,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

3221
02:07:16,211 --> 02:07:17,760
That's excellent.
And then pull it out.

3222
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:18,594
Someone,
um,

3223
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:21,240
served a sheep.
I was at a,

3224
02:07:21,241 --> 02:07:22,050
um,
uh,

3225
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:23,880
a camp.
It was absolutely at to hone.

3226
02:07:23,881 --> 02:07:26,750
We were,
it was a pig hunting and someone,

3227
02:07:26,751 --> 02:07:27,930
um,
brought by,

3228
02:07:27,931 --> 02:07:30,930
uh,
some sheep back straps and they had it

3229
02:07:30,931 --> 02:07:33,480
marinated in a Italian address.
God's right there.

3230
02:07:34,780 --> 02:07:37,750
There's nothing better than dall sheep
or stone sheep back shops.

3231
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,300
Yeah.
It's amazing how good they taste so

3232
02:07:40,301 --> 02:07:43,540
good.
Civitas is that the best meat of all the

3233
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:47,160
meats is the same as then horn,
big horns,

3234
02:07:47,170 --> 02:07:47,700
not near it.

3235
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:48,730
It's,
it's good.

3236
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:51,370
And like the harder you work for it,
the better it is.

3237
02:07:51,371 --> 02:07:56,371
But like a sheep tinder line pulled
right out one minute each side as hot as

3238
02:07:56,861 --> 02:07:58,030
you can get it.
And I mean,

3239
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:59,290
it's just,
that's it.

3240
02:07:59,310 --> 02:07:59,741
Yeah.
Right.

3241
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:02,230
You just want to see her at,
no one will ever know how good it is

3242
02:08:02,231 --> 02:08:04,960
because they never make it out.
No critical ever get a bite of that.

3243
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:06,820
Right.
Because they never get it out of the

3244
02:08:06,821 --> 02:08:07,654
mountain.
Nope.

3245
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:09,850
Never comes out.
Most of the time you cook it while

3246
02:08:09,851 --> 02:08:10,684
you're up there,
right?

3247
02:08:10,780 --> 02:08:11,590
Yeah.
A lot of times.

3248
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:12,423
Yeah,
I do.

3249
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:17,470
We have a thing called man Kebabs,
which is you got to hunt down the

3250
02:08:17,471 --> 02:08:18,940
animal.
You got to kill it.

3251
02:08:19,210 --> 02:08:21,130
You got to bring it,
you got to pack it back to camp.

3252
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:23,350
You got to start a fire that you create.

3253
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:26,380
You got to harvest the willow stick that
you're gonna put the meat on and you

3254
02:08:26,381 --> 02:08:28,840
chop it up.
You slide on the meat and at the time we

3255
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:32,290
only had top ramen seasoning,
so we sprinkle the top Rosin Rom

3256
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,730
[inaudible],
put it over the fire.

3257
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:38,110
That's a man Kebab top vegetables.
It's kind of kind of funny though.

3258
02:08:38,140 --> 02:08:40,470
The top Ramen is the CS,
but top Ramen sees you.

3259
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:41,920
It's fucking good.
It's fucking,

3260
02:08:41,950 --> 02:08:44,010
when I used to eat that stuff and I get
some of it,

3261
02:08:44,030 --> 02:08:47,080
I'll just a little bit on the table,
put it on my finger.

3262
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:48,580
It's delicious too.
Good season,

3263
02:08:48,581 --> 02:08:50,530
good seasoning.
You get really creative.

3264
02:08:50,531 --> 02:08:52,930
You don't have much.
It's probably a good idea to like to

3265
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:55,870
bring like in camp,
it's a small package.

3266
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:58,620
It's already sealed up.
It's like a good size for,

3267
02:08:58,630 --> 02:09:02,020
it's crazy and you do it as like a rub
and the bobs on that thing.

3268
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:05,380
Granted you're starving to death by the
time you kill this animal and put out

3269
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:06,970
the fire.
But it is off the hook.

3270
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,110
Well,
when we,

3271
02:09:08,111 --> 02:09:09,640
uh,
when I hunted with Rinella the very

3272
02:09:09,641 --> 02:09:13,570
first time and shot a mule deer and then
we ate the liver that night,

3273
02:09:13,571 --> 02:09:17,110
we hung up most of the meat and tree
because it was like pretty close to dark

3274
02:09:17,470 --> 02:09:19,090
and we went back the next day to pack it
out.

3275
02:09:19,150 --> 02:09:20,050
But when,
uh,

3276
02:09:20,140 --> 02:09:22,900
we went back to camp and ate liver and
onions,

3277
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:26,260
like from an animal that died two hours
ago,

3278
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:29,320
it was like the most insanely delicious
food I've ever had in my life.

3279
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,150
You couldn't,
I couldn't believe how good it tastes.

3280
02:09:31,151 --> 02:09:31,661
Yeah.
You were hunting.

3281
02:09:31,661 --> 02:09:34,000
Did you guys,
you guys handed down from the ferry up

3282
02:09:34,001 --> 02:09:35,010
on the Missouri up there?
Yeah.

3283
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:36,520
Yeah.
On a cheap in there a bunch.

3284
02:09:36,521 --> 02:09:36,730
Yeah.

3285
02:09:36,730 --> 02:09:37,140
That's it.
Cool.

3286
02:09:37,140 --> 02:09:39,760
I saw a lot of sheep up there.
It's probably pretty hard to get a tag

3287
02:09:39,761 --> 02:09:40,250
though,
right?

3288
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:41,970
Hardest place in the world.
Is that the brakes?

3289
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,823
Yeah.
Yeah.

3290
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:44,380
Hardest place in the world.
Get a tag.

3291
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:45,310
Yep.
That's interesting.

3292
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:47,890
They're just doing a really good job of
making sure the populations go up.

3293
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:49,900
Biggest sheep in the world and a,
yeah,

3294
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:55,140
they had giant balls.
We spent a whole segment of the show

3295
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:58,930
concentrating on the balls of the sheep,
like Rinella.

3296
02:09:58,931 --> 02:10:00,970
Made a video.
Put as few as you can find this cause

3297
02:10:01,010 --> 02:10:03,100
it's pretty funny.
Um,

3298
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:05,650
we were,
we were there and Rinella like is

3299
02:10:05,651 --> 02:10:08,860
obsessed with these big horn sheep and
their balls.

3300
02:10:09,010 --> 02:10:10,900
And he's like,
the moment I kill one of these things,

3301
02:10:10,930 --> 02:10:12,580
I'm going to,
I'm going to kill it and I'm gonna take

3302
02:10:12,581 --> 02:10:14,200
one of those balls and I'm just going to
eat it.

3303
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:16,930
I've eaten an eat like an apple eating
them.

3304
02:10:17,050 --> 02:10:17,741
They're great.
They're here.

3305
02:10:17,741 --> 02:10:18,350
They're,
they're the,

3306
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:20,050
they're the biggest of anything that I'm
like,

3307
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:21,970
Oh yeah,
that you killed.

3308
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:24,880
Yup.
What does she bought this?

3309
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:30,610
I'm not doing that for Steve.
Just make good like everything else.

3310
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:32,770
You're like Cameron Hanes.
Cameron Hayes won't need heart.

3311
02:10:32,830 --> 02:10:34,400
He won't eat liver.
We want to do anything.

3312
02:10:34,401 --> 02:10:35,390
I'm like,
you're crazy.

3313
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,200
When we shot an elk house cutting the
heart,

3314
02:10:37,210 --> 02:10:38,090
I was like,
you're going to eat that?

3315
02:10:38,091 --> 02:10:38,761
I'm like,
fuck yeah,

3316
02:10:38,761 --> 02:10:40,880
I'm eat this around the hole I put in
it.

3317
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:42,351
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3318
02:10:42,351 --> 02:10:43,600
You've got to cut around the hall.
Yeah.

3319
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:46,250
Depending on what's a bow and Arrow,
you don't have to do that.

3320
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:49,970
You know you get that weird funky led in
your mouth.

3321
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:50,790
Yeah,
exactly.

3322
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:51,620
So,
uh,

3323
02:10:51,620 --> 02:10:54,470
this is a,
him and I up there and he started,

3324
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:55,510
he started

3325
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:57,940
obsessing about the balls

3326
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:04,750
exactly where you guys are.
I mean exactly where you're at

3327
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:09,910
when you go home and tell people what a
bad spot I took you to.

3328
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:11,180
And you say,
well,

3329
02:11:11,210 --> 02:11:14,350
we did see a lot of big orange zone.
What they're going to say is something

3330
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:17,140
like,
what kind of dumb ass once mule deer in

3331
02:11:17,141 --> 02:11:22,141
big horn county.
You've never seen a scrolling.

3332
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:34,830
I'd love to show you if you turn right
or house on diapers.

3333
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:36,353
No,
it's perfect.

3334
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:39,480
It's like a,
it's like a church bell.

3335
02:11:41,420 --> 02:11:43,760
This is like a church bell hanging down
translate

3336
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:49,870
or they also eat crazy animal.
No,

3337
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,720
this isn't one of the real do at church
bell.

3338
02:11:51,870 --> 02:11:53,400
Yeah.
That's impressive.

3339
02:11:56,110 --> 02:12:00,390
Here it goes.
The first thing I'm going to do when I

3340
02:12:00,391 --> 02:12:04,590
kill him one and then punch my tag and
I'm going to eat the contents of that

3341
02:12:04,591 --> 02:12:08,760
sac just straight out.
Just raw

3342
02:12:10,730 --> 02:12:11,870
apples.
Why?

3343
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:14,933
Why?
I don't know.

3344
02:12:16,890 --> 02:12:18,480
I feel a calling to do it.

3345
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:23,480
He's another really important factor in
educating people by Connie cause he's a

3346
02:12:23,481 --> 02:12:25,580
very well read,
very intelligent guy,

3347
02:12:25,760 --> 02:12:29,900
very educated and really very,
very ethical.

3348
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:34,160
I mean is it ethical and as driven as
you can be.

3349
02:12:34,480 --> 02:12:36,140
Do you read this book?
American Buffalo?

3350
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,640
Yeah.
Well I didn't read that one.

3351
02:12:37,641 --> 02:12:39,080
I read the other one in the mediator
one.

3352
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:40,580
Oh,
did you read the American Buffalo?

3353
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:42,420
I heard it,
yeah.

3354
02:12:42,850 --> 02:12:45,440
He's got to this to the Max Buffaloes.
Tragic.

3355
02:12:45,670 --> 02:12:46,300
Yeah,
it is.

3356
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:50,270
He spells it out so well.
Well he had this guy on his podcast,

3357
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:54,270
Dan Flores,
who is a wildlife biologist who a wild

3358
02:12:54,271 --> 02:12:55,610
f.
His story and I should say it's an

3359
02:12:55,611 --> 02:13:00,611
amazing podcast where he details the
history of animals and European settlers

3360
02:13:00,921 --> 02:13:04,640
coming over here and the wiping out of
the various animals and what's being

3361
02:13:04,641 --> 02:13:06,650
done to try to restore that.
They're primed.

3362
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:09,290
They're trying to do something called
the American Serengeti where they're

3363
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:13,190
trying to put together like a,
an area like a protected area,

3364
02:13:13,191 --> 02:13:16,070
like as big as yellowstone,
but that's actually good involve

3365
02:13:16,071 --> 02:13:17,310
hunting.
Really.

3366
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:20,050
You're buying property right now in
Montana that's going on.

3367
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:23,330
What's it going to be?
I don't know that much about it.

3368
02:13:23,331 --> 02:13:26,120
I only just bought a property that's not
very far from where you guys were there

3369
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:27,650
that um,
that,

3370
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,570
that there,
it's in block management,

3371
02:13:29,571 --> 02:13:30,680
you're allowed to hunt it,
but it's,

3372
02:13:30,681 --> 02:13:31,410
you know,
they're,

3373
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:32,010
I think they're pulling

3374
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:34,860
the cattle off it and um,
but you know,

3375
02:13:34,890 --> 02:13:36,540
that's,
that's a huge success story right there.

3376
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:36,900
I mean,
those,

3377
02:13:36,900 --> 02:13:38,870
those sheep were planted back in there
in 1970s.

3378
02:13:38,871 --> 02:13:43,470
It's probably the biggest herd and in
Montana and certainly the best sheep

3379
02:13:43,471 --> 02:13:46,080
hunting in the world.
And they were planted in there in the

3380
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:51,080
70s and started hunting in about 1990.
They restarted hunting again.

3381
02:13:51,311 --> 02:13:55,410
And I mean they were totally brought
back from money from an auction tag,

3382
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:58,440
but a transplant in there and they've
exploded onto the landscape.

3383
02:13:58,441 --> 02:14:00,080
They were shot out by mark and hunting
and,

3384
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:02,610
and domestic sheep interaction,
you know,

3385
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:06,180
years ago and then brought back and now
it's the best place in the world,

3386
02:14:06,181 --> 02:14:07,070
you know,
and that wouldn't happen.

3387
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:09,630
A lot of hunters and is an amazing
success story.

3388
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:11,970
And that's,
that's an also an interesting thing.

3389
02:14:11,971 --> 02:14:13,980
These auction tags,
which is really weird,

3390
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:17,850
where you let someone,
you give them this opportunity to hunt.

3391
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:21,000
And a lot of times these guys are
spending hundreds of thousands of

3392
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:21,630
dollars.
I got it.

3393
02:14:21,630 --> 02:14:25,250
The most expensive tag in history,
$485,000 right there.

3394
02:14:25,270 --> 02:14:26,520
Missouri breaks.
Yeah.

3395
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,870
What,
2013.

3396
02:14:27,871 --> 02:14:29,610
Yeah.
He wanted those balls,

3397
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:32,340
guy paid.
So I mean,

3398
02:14:32,341 --> 02:14:34,240
there was a huge ram that,
uh,

3399
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:36,180
a couple of hours,
three of us that,

3400
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:37,320
that guy did it.
And,

3401
02:14:37,321 --> 02:14:37,890
uh,
there was,

3402
02:14:37,890 --> 02:14:38,671
um,
yeah,

3403
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:42,750
like I paid $485 and the,
the money thing about that is really

3404
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:45,210
weird.
It's this perception of some rich dude

3405
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:49,110
like you're paying for an opportunity to
bypass the system to do something that

3406
02:14:49,111 --> 02:14:51,540
you would normally have to draw.
It's as simple as that.

3407
02:14:51,541 --> 02:14:54,900
It's not like I'm going to spend this
huge amount of money and you know,

3408
02:14:54,901 --> 02:14:57,580
it's this huge head hunt in this ego
thing and he got guys live here.

3409
02:14:57,581 --> 02:15:00,210
I mean like there's so many
misconceptions about what goes on with

3410
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:02,130
that type of thing that it's not even
funny.

3411
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:05,220
It's a tax write off.
It's a donation of wildlife if you

3412
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:09,540
really care about wildlife and it gives
the guy an opportunity to take,

3413
02:15:09,541 --> 02:15:10,171
you know,
and again,

3414
02:15:10,171 --> 02:15:12,570
if you're a billionaire,
if you've made a ton of money and you

3415
02:15:12,571 --> 02:15:14,430
care about wildlife and you love to
hunt,

3416
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,340
why would you not do that?
It's not that weird.

3417
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:20,130
I mean,
I mean it's all relative.

3418
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:22,380
It's money and said donation.
And yes,

3419
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:23,550
we had,
we had this big sheep,

3420
02:15:23,551 --> 02:15:26,400
he spent 18 days hunting and it's the
biggest one ever been killed with an

3421
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:30,270
auction tag in the United States and it
was a phenomenal hunt and the guy you

3422
02:15:30,280 --> 02:15:31,890
know was glad to donate the money and
it's,

3423
02:15:31,891 --> 02:15:34,590
you know it's,
it's provided new sheep transplants

3424
02:15:34,591 --> 02:15:37,770
money for wildlife that would not exist
if they didn't do it.

3425
02:15:37,771 --> 02:15:39,660
It's one tag and raise a half a million
dollars.

3426
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:43,350
Well that's the big contradiction when
people talk about hunting and hunting

3427
02:15:43,351 --> 02:15:45,910
being for conservation,
how it helps conservation that.

3428
02:15:45,910 --> 02:15:50,430
That is one of the biggest examples of
it is how much money goes into helping

3429
02:15:50,431 --> 02:15:54,840
these animals and habitat preservation
and reintroducing them to areas like

3430
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:58,380
with the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation
has done with reintroducing elk to a

3431
02:15:58,381 --> 02:16:01,410
bunch of different places is the biggest
success in North America.

3432
02:16:01,411 --> 02:16:04,440
I mean they were shot basically into a
few places and they've,

3433
02:16:04,470 --> 02:16:08,490
they brought them back through and it's
strongly been through money by guys that

3434
02:16:08,491 --> 02:16:10,320
are fortunate enough to be able to do
it.

3435
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:12,090
And it is,
it's a total misconception.

3436
02:16:12,091 --> 02:16:15,750
I mean you are paying,
the guy is paying money as a tax

3437
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:19,890
donation and he's giving money to
something he truly cares about that he

3438
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:21,660
loves and has probably grown up doing
is,

3439
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:23,160
you know,
this guy was self made,

3440
02:16:23,161 --> 02:16:27,220
started painting boards and West
Virginia and started a bank and made $1

3441
02:16:27,220 --> 02:16:27,330
billion.
You know,

3442
02:16:27,330 --> 02:16:29,270
like he loves hunting.
That's what loves.

3443
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,140
He was not,
it's not some rich guy panda.

3444
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:33,390
You don't put a head on his wall and he,
and,

3445
02:16:33,391 --> 02:16:36,550
and he was glad to do it.
And you're paying for the opportunity.

3446
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:38,140
I mean,
the thing that's always lost in it is,

3447
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:40,990
is the dead animal or whatever the guy's
paying for the opportunity.

3448
02:16:40,991 --> 02:16:44,890
We had no advantage over anybody else
was the same season everybody else did.

3449
02:16:45,310 --> 02:16:47,320
And the guy,
we ended up killing him,

3450
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:48,700
you know,
a great big Ram,

3451
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:49,480
which was,
you know,

3452
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,200
obviously the goal,
but I mean,

3453
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:54,410
one sheep raised a half a million
dollars and does incredible and,

3454
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:56,430
and a guy,
he was banned for the opportunity.

3455
02:16:56,431 --> 02:16:57,264
He's not paying for it,
you know,

3456
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,680
you know,
it'd be a hell of lot easier to buy a

3457
02:16:59,681 --> 02:17:03,610
great big head to put on your wall.
Then it would to be to spend that much

3458
02:17:03,611 --> 02:17:05,650
money and then go out there and maybe
not get them.

3459
02:17:05,990 --> 02:17:07,740
But the,
the pursuit is,

3460
02:17:08,390 --> 02:17:10,330
is what drives and how does that work?
Look,

3461
02:17:10,331 --> 02:17:12,130
there's three guides.
So do you,

3462
02:17:12,131 --> 02:17:14,960
did you guys scout in advance and find
those unique?

3463
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:17,480
Those are unique situation.
We had a son in,

3464
02:17:17,490 --> 02:17:19,600
in it's,
it's a basically a three year story of

3465
02:17:19,601 --> 02:17:23,950
following one ram Ram me called
[inaudible] 52 and in 2010,

3466
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:27,280
a friend of ours was with a guy who
killed around,

3467
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:28,860
um,
up in the breaks,

3468
02:17:28,861 --> 02:17:30,640
same deal,
exact same area you ran.

3469
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,590
And there was a big ram standing with
it.

3470
02:17:32,591 --> 02:17:34,450
There was two big rams together,
killed one of them.

3471
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,210
And,
and uh,

3472
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:39,110
the next year when we were up there
scouting,

3473
02:17:39,140 --> 02:17:40,380
we came across this ram.
I'm like,

3474
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:43,090
that's the same ram in the photo.
They took a photo right before they

3475
02:17:43,091 --> 02:17:45,840
killed it.
And then we tried to hunt them in 2012.

3476
02:17:45,880 --> 02:17:48,400
Didn't get him.
And in 2013 it was like this,

3477
02:17:48,401 --> 02:17:48,880
this ram.

3478
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:51,070
He was really big.
And then he slipped through two years.

3479
02:17:51,071 --> 02:17:53,200
Nobody got him smart old,
smart old sheet.

3480
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,760
I mean,
really smart.

3481
02:17:55,300 --> 02:17:57,190
And it was all of a sudden,
you know,

3482
02:17:57,191 --> 02:17:58,480
we let a few guys know that,
hey,

3483
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:02,170
there's not an unusually big ram up
here,

3484
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:04,390
and if,
if you want a chance to hunt it,

3485
02:18:04,391 --> 02:18:07,630
and it's unique in the timeframe and the
fact that there's not always big sheep

3486
02:18:07,631 --> 02:18:08,201
around.
I mean,

3487
02:18:08,201 --> 02:18:09,550
this is,
this is one year.

3488
02:18:09,700 --> 02:18:13,810
This ram is alive right now.
And we told a few guys and five guys

3489
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:14,470
went,
you know,

3490
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:16,520
there was five guys that are willing to
pay half a million dollars.

3491
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:17,081
I went to,
I mean,

3492
02:18:17,081 --> 02:18:22,081
there was five guys bid in over $460,000
for the opportunity to hunt this area.

3493
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:28,210
Look at the size of that thing.
Oh my God.

3494
02:18:28,330 --> 02:18:32,110
There you go.
The horns on that thing are insane.

3495
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:35,590
Yeah.
Will he edinger Al Mckinney and myself

3496
02:18:35,591 --> 02:18:36,220
and,
uh,

3497
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:38,950
I mean,
we spent 18 days like rattlesnakes out

3498
02:18:38,951 --> 02:18:41,110
there and it was a,
it was an awesome hunt.

3499
02:18:41,111 --> 02:18:41,540
I mean it's,
uh,

3500
02:18:41,540 --> 02:18:42,910
it's,
it was a smart old ram.

3501
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:43,744
It was,
uh,

3502
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,690
it was just a,
just a really cool deal and the guy and

3503
02:18:46,700 --> 02:18:47,740
we ended up getting it.
Um,

3504
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:51,520
how far do you take it from?
He almost killed it with a bow.

3505
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:53,950
We,
I snuck him into 12 yards,

3506
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:57,400
came over the top on it and a resident
hunter,

3507
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:01,240
uh,
being a dick came down the ridge and

3508
02:19:01,241 --> 02:19:05,470
spooked the sheet that spotted us,
knew we were hunting as sheep and came

3509
02:19:05,471 --> 02:19:07,840
down and spooked the ram.
But he should have killed it with a

3510
02:19:07,841 --> 02:19:08,441
bowl.
We,

3511
02:19:08,441 --> 02:19:11,620
I mean a hunter with a sheep tag where
the sheep tag.

3512
02:19:11,650 --> 02:19:12,910
Yeah.
They do it on purpose.

3513
02:19:13,270 --> 02:19:14,440
Yeah,
I think so.

3514
02:19:14,590 --> 02:19:17,680
Yeah.
I mean if you saw three guys and you

3515
02:19:17,681 --> 02:19:21,220
knew that they had a guy with him that
had paid $485,000 to be there,

3516
02:19:21,221 --> 02:19:21,970
new,
all this,

3517
02:19:21,970 --> 02:19:24,400
you would probably think I'm probably in
the right area.

3518
02:19:24,750 --> 02:19:26,260
Right.
All these guys.

3519
02:19:26,580 --> 02:19:27,413
Yeah.
No Shit.

3520
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:28,000
But that's where

3521
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,450
it gets weird with public land,
right?

3522
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,760
Yes.
Does that Ram bugged out?

3523
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:35,540
We killed him 10 days later.
Nine miles from where there and how far

3524
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:37,310
was the,
the shot when he killed him,

3525
02:19:37,370 --> 02:19:38,960
he shot him at four 60 that's a
different,

3526
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:39,920
oh wow.
That's another,

3527
02:19:39,950 --> 02:19:41,330
that's a different realm.
God Damn,

3528
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:46,100
that thing's massing.
Tazy so I was fortunate to be on both of

3529
02:19:46,101 --> 02:19:47,720
those.
That's two of the top five sheep ever

3530
02:19:47,721 --> 02:19:51,530
killed Montana and 10 days.
They are just majestic beasts.

3531
02:19:51,531 --> 02:19:54,200
When you look at the,
what nature has given them in their

3532
02:19:54,201 --> 02:19:58,220
head,
like what a crazy animal that develop

3533
02:19:58,221 --> 02:20:02,630
these gigantic battering rams out of the
top of their skull and the photos really

3534
02:20:02,631 --> 02:20:05,000
don't do those things.
Just know you put your hands on those

3535
02:20:05,001 --> 02:20:05,541
horns.
I mean,

3536
02:20:05,541 --> 02:20:08,210
it's impressive.
Both 11 and a half years old.

3537
02:20:08,211 --> 02:20:09,590
I mean that's,
that's the end of his life.

3538
02:20:09,590 --> 02:20:10,341
I mean he's,
you know,

3539
02:20:10,341 --> 02:20:12,440
he's,
he's running his full course that Ram

3540
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:15,850
actually did not run at all,
that Ram had a broken shoulder and we

3541
02:20:15,851 --> 02:20:18,170
had seen him for a couple of years.
He had a really small body and he was

3542
02:20:18,171 --> 02:20:21,530
actually a nondominant sheep and it was,
it was just kind of floating around out

3543
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:22,190
there.
He wasn't really,

3544
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:23,510
he was,
he was just physically,

3545
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:24,880
physically past his prime.
Yeah.

3546
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:27,700
So did you like fall or something or
hunting accident?

3547
02:20:27,701 --> 02:20:29,060
Hard to say.
It's hard to say.

3548
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,670
Yeah.
I mean they have a tough life.

3549
02:20:31,700 --> 02:20:33,410
Yeah.
That it's for an animal like that to

3550
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:36,440
live that long.
It's nature is so incredible and it's

3551
02:20:36,441 --> 02:20:40,070
diversity that this is something that we
have here in North America,

3552
02:20:40,071 --> 02:20:42,530
this incredible animal.
Just a strange looking.

3553
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:45,410
I mean almost [inaudible] we're so used
to them.

3554
02:20:45,411 --> 02:20:48,500
We know they exist,
so I don't think we kind of appreciate

3555
02:20:48,501 --> 02:20:51,890
them as much as if it were just
introduced to them as an adult.

3556
02:20:51,890 --> 02:20:53,540
If you'd never heard of or seen it
before,

3557
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:55,460
probably blow you away.
Totally.

3558
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:58,280
But a crazy animal.
It's kind of a battering ram on its

3559
02:20:58,281 --> 02:20:59,300
head.
It does.

3560
02:21:00,010 --> 02:21:03,350
I always say like with desert sheep,
you know they had this tiny little neck

3561
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:05,450
and it's like when you see one out in
the desert,

3562
02:21:05,451 --> 02:21:06,800
a desert sheep,
a big Ram,

3563
02:21:06,801 --> 02:21:08,780
it's like they wouldn't look any
stranger if they were green.

3564
02:21:08,781 --> 02:21:11,750
Like if they landed on Mars,
if they landed on Mars and all of a

3565
02:21:11,751 --> 02:21:13,370
sudden there was a desert,
she popped his head up.

3566
02:21:13,371 --> 02:21:15,170
You'd be like,
it's about what I thought it'd be here.

3567
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:19,940
It's rocky and dry and his next this big
and he's got a 50 pound head.

3568
02:21:19,941 --> 02:21:22,730
Like that's about what I thought.
Have you ever seen the video with the

3569
02:21:22,731 --> 02:21:25,640
ram and the cow?
Buttheads I haven't.

3570
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:30,680
Gerrymandering does a video,
crazy video where this ram starts moving

3571
02:21:30,801 --> 02:21:34,300
towards this cow and the cows calf and
the cow decides it's going to Headbutt

3572
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:36,500
this ram.
Watch this go full screen.

3573
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:41,510
Check this out,
watch the ram comes in in division and

3574
02:21:41,511 --> 02:21:44,120
the cows like,
fuck this so it sees it.

3575
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:45,103
Watch this.

3576
02:21:48,270 --> 02:21:53,270
The callout Chiodo and he gets up.
I can't tell if that's a bull.

3577
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:55,200
Is it a bull or a cow?
I can't tell them.

3578
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:58,150
That's hard to tell.
It's a blurry ass picture or blurry

3579
02:21:58,280 --> 02:22:00,230
video,
but it's just this tiny little thing

3580
02:22:00,231 --> 02:22:02,000
that weighs about 150 pounds.
The cows,

3581
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:04,980
not much more than a thousand and chaos,
he said,

3582
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:06,630
but I've seen him.
I mean,

3583
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:11,180
I've seen rams that had their skulls
broken entire horn torn off like that,

3584
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:13,140
that amount of power.
I mean they,

3585
02:22:13,141 --> 02:22:18,100
they get up and when they hit and then
just like this state of right after gag

3586
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:21,530
know where after you take a huge upper
cut and they just stand there and kind

3587
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:22,364
of go,
oh,

3588
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:24,450
and then they kind of come back and I'm
like,

3589
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:25,530
all right,
let's do that again.

3590
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,660
I didn't get enough of that.
They've got,

3591
02:22:27,690 --> 02:22:29,220
they've got cte.
Yeah.

3592
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:29,940
Oh for sure.

3593
02:22:29,940 --> 02:22:31,440
Yeah.
I don't do a football study on them.

3594
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:32,303
Yeah,
exactly.

3595
02:22:32,650 --> 02:22:33,820
You got to wonder like what?
What did,

3596
02:22:33,821 --> 02:22:37,410
what crazy design that nature has
figured out a way to have all these

3597
02:22:37,411 --> 02:22:38,800
various different does it,
here we go,

3598
02:22:38,840 --> 02:22:41,630
boom.
And they just sit,

3599
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:44,340
stand there.
Look at this collision.

3600
02:22:44,910 --> 02:22:46,380
That's when to make your stock right.
Then.

3601
02:22:46,650 --> 02:22:48,600
Well,
one of these dummies needs to figure out

3602
02:22:48,601 --> 02:22:51,060
how to dive under and get an uppercut
going.

3603
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:52,200
Get some leverage.
Yeah.

3604
02:22:52,210 --> 02:22:57,200
Just like don't head bottom to come.
You got to Juco and then slide under.

3605
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:59,200
You're talking about,
you're talking about the balls.

3606
02:22:59,201 --> 02:23:02,580
Big Horn sheep have two moves.
So it's this move right here.

3607
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:04,950
And then when they're posturing and
kicking each other around their other

3608
02:23:04,951 --> 02:23:06,570
movies,
they get behind each other and smash

3609
02:23:06,571 --> 02:23:07,680
each other in the balls.
Oh,

3610
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:10,830
the front kick to the is a big horn
sheep.

3611
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:12,470
Look at the balls,
look at the balls in these things.

3612
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:13,470
Watch this.
Boom.

3613
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:16,020
Look at these nuts.
Look at these nuts.

3614
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:18,120
Look at there's nothing.
And if I had nuts like that,

3615
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:19,890
I'd never wear pants.
I'd be like,

3616
02:23:19,891 --> 02:23:21,540
everybody's just deal with what I've got
here.

3617
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:23,940
That you wouldn't be doing a podcast,
maybe doing videos.

3618
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:29,320
That'd be in the poem business son.
And that echoes for like the sheep I

3619
02:23:29,321 --> 02:23:31,140
hinted last fall.
That's how I actually found him.

3620
02:23:31,430 --> 02:23:33,090
Oh,
you hear here in the middle of the

3621
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:34,010
night,
boom.

3622
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:36,750
It sounds like gunshots going off real
and you'd get up.

3623
02:23:36,810 --> 02:23:37,760
I got up and yeah,
it's,

3624
02:23:37,830 --> 02:23:40,290
it took me four hours to figure it out
where they were because it echos all

3625
02:23:40,291 --> 02:23:41,970
over.
But you can get about every 25 minutes

3626
02:23:41,971 --> 02:23:44,640
you'd hear boom.
And it just sounds just like a gunshot

3627
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:45,331
and it's like,
okay,

3628
02:23:45,331 --> 02:23:47,460
they're there and you start honing it in
and boom,

3629
02:23:47,461 --> 02:23:48,080
there they were.

3630
02:23:48,080 --> 02:23:49,980
Wow.
10 Rams and they were butting heads.

3631
02:23:50,060 --> 02:23:51,150
Yup.
It's pretty,

3632
02:23:51,240 --> 02:23:52,800
pretty cool.
Like little things like that.

3633
02:23:52,801 --> 02:23:55,110
It's like he just so cool.
Well,

3634
02:23:55,111 --> 02:23:58,480
being out there in the wild,
you get to experience firsthand the

3635
02:23:58,481 --> 02:24:01,170
diversity of all these wild.
They're like mule deer with their

3636
02:24:01,171 --> 02:24:06,171
incredible racks or elk or or big horn
sheep and there's so many bizarre

3637
02:24:06,181 --> 02:24:09,240
creations and there's so much diversity.
Are they hitting each other in the

3638
02:24:09,241 --> 02:24:10,320
balls?
Oh yeah.

3639
02:24:10,350 --> 02:24:12,210
How rude.
Look at it.

3640
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:16,440
He's just kicking him out balls.
He's like,

3641
02:24:16,441 --> 02:24:17,880
fuck you.
I'm going to get behind you and kick you

3642
02:24:17,881 --> 02:24:18,440
in the ball.
I was like,

3643
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:18,731
no,
no,

3644
02:24:18,731 --> 02:24:18,970
no,
no,

3645
02:24:18,970 --> 02:24:19,980
no.
I already know that move

3646
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:26,040
every time he's kicking the other sheep
in the balls.

3647
02:24:26,450 --> 02:24:29,160
Get five minutes.
See if you get kicked in the balls.

3648
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:30,180
Oh yeah.
They've got no time.

3649
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:32,610
No time.
It's hilarious.

3650
02:24:32,730 --> 02:24:35,340
They know that they have balls,
so they go to attack them.

3651
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:36,960
You know,
what the fuck did they figure that out?

3652
02:24:37,520 --> 02:24:39,720
How do they know that?
Balls or I guess they know that they

3653
02:24:39,721 --> 02:24:41,250
have balls.
You have balls that big,

3654
02:24:41,251 --> 02:24:44,400
you're going to figure that out.
Something's going to hit those things.

3655
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:47,960
But what a bunch of dickheads or magic,
they're fascinating to.

3656
02:24:47,980 --> 02:24:48,631
They're like,
I mean,

3657
02:24:48,631 --> 02:24:49,580
when they're in the Rut,
they're,

3658
02:24:49,581 --> 02:24:51,780
they're a totally different animal than
when they're,

3659
02:24:51,870 --> 02:24:52,800
when the early,
you know,

3660
02:24:52,801 --> 02:24:53,850
when they're,
when they,

3661
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:57,360
when they get late in the year and start
chasing like there's nothing,

3662
02:24:57,361 --> 02:25:00,300
they just go insane.
Isn't that also bizarre that they have a

3663
02:25:00,301 --> 02:25:03,390
season where they have to have sex where
you lose your mind?

3664
02:25:03,391 --> 02:25:05,440
Yeah.
Once we got that too.

3665
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,860
Yeah.
But we get to do it all at all at

3666
02:25:07,861 --> 02:25:10,200
college and we can jerk off.
Yeah.

3667
02:25:10,330 --> 02:25:12,750
You can alleviate it yourself.
So he could think clearly.

3668
02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:14,560
But these poor bastards,
you know,

3669
02:25:14,561 --> 02:25:16,530
all the wait all year,
all year,

3670
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:17,580
no one,
they go nuts.

3671
02:25:18,270 --> 02:25:21,160
Just getting ready.
No wonder they're balls are so big and

3672
02:25:21,161 --> 02:25:23,040
dearborn with weapons.
Yup.

3673
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:23,601
Yup.
You know,

3674
02:25:23,601 --> 02:25:24,820
and,
and as they get older,

3675
02:25:24,821 --> 02:25:26,650
the more dominant ones of the bigger
weapons,

3676
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:29,860
which is this what a strange system that
nature's figured out.

3677
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:31,060
It is,
isn't it?

3678
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:33,880
And it's also strange to me like how you
see when it's all over,

3679
02:25:33,881 --> 02:25:36,370
they bachelor up like when the ruts
over,

3680
02:25:36,371 --> 02:25:38,680
like we,
we went moose hunting and BC last year

3681
02:25:38,860 --> 02:25:42,250
and when the Rut was over we found these
like bachelor groups of Moose there

3682
02:25:42,251 --> 02:25:43,930
probably were trying to kill each other
just a couple of weeks.

3683
02:25:43,931 --> 02:25:45,350
We know how it is though.
He beat up somebody.

3684
02:25:45,370 --> 02:25:46,420
Your best friends after,
right?

3685
02:25:46,480 --> 02:25:47,920
I guess.
Right?

3686
02:25:48,190 --> 02:25:49,690
You don't bang his girlfriend either.
Yeah.

3687
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,790
I don't think anybody has a claim on any
of them.

3688
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:53,800
They're all just running around trying
to try to score.

3689
02:25:53,801 --> 02:25:56,530
But I think when it's all over there,
they're probably like,

3690
02:25:56,531 --> 02:25:58,960
what the fuck was,
what were we doing just a couple of

3691
02:25:58,960 --> 02:25:59,793
weeks ago?
Yeah.

3692
02:26:00,450 --> 02:26:02,590
What came over us.
I think they knew.

3693
02:26:03,250 --> 02:26:05,290
I know,
but it's just strange that it comes over

3694
02:26:05,291 --> 02:26:09,400
them so strong here and it's so strong
and the rest of the time,

3695
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:13,000
like a big Ram wants nothing.
Like if you were,

3696
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:16,390
if your sheep hunting the rest of the
year and you see in use,

3697
02:26:16,450 --> 02:26:19,090
you're in the wrong spot.
They want nothing to do with them

3698
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:20,220
really.
I don't blame him.

3699
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,073
Yeah.
Same,

3700
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:23,200
same with big,
same a big bull elk and serve their

3701
02:26:23,201 --> 02:26:24,270
purpose.
Same.

3702
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:25,330
Yeah.
Same with bullets.

3703
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:28,000
I mean,
aside from the Rut and a few times or

3704
02:26:28,001 --> 02:26:31,090
they interact the rest of the time.
Like if you're seeing tons of counts,

3705
02:26:31,091 --> 02:26:31,924
you're in the wrong spot.

3706
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:33,220
Well,
that's what I told you about,

3707
02:26:33,250 --> 02:26:35,890
uh,
when I was in Montana and we saw a

3708
02:26:35,890 --> 02:26:37,510
hundred elk together.
All cats this time.

3709
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:38,050
Yeah.
No,

3710
02:26:38,050 --> 02:26:38,950
no.
All cows.

3711
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:40,390
Yeah.
We're little spikes or something.

3712
02:26:40,420 --> 02:26:41,340
Yeah,
exactly.

3713
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:44,070
I saw like one spike.
It's just,

3714
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:48,400
it's so fascinating that diversity that,
that nature's created so many different

3715
02:26:48,401 --> 02:26:50,710
animals.
Like that one hunting gives us the

3716
02:26:50,711 --> 02:26:52,910
opportunity to truly see it as it is.
Oh yeah.

3717
02:26:52,930 --> 02:26:54,910
There's like a national park or
yellowstone.

3718
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:58,210
Yeah.
To see it as it is up close in its

3719
02:26:58,211 --> 02:27:02,410
natural habitat when it's quiet and you
get the sales thing the way it's been

3720
02:27:02,411 --> 02:27:04,730
for so long,
does it,

3721
02:27:04,800 --> 02:27:07,960
don't you feel like when,
when you sneak up on an animal too and

3722
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:08,320
you,
you,

3723
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:10,280
you lock eyes with that thing,
it almost,

3724
02:27:10,380 --> 02:27:13,240
you almost feel like you're in,
it almost feels like a different

3725
02:27:13,241 --> 02:27:14,680
dimension.
There's all like that.

3726
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:17,770
He gets your,
you're in this world that they exist in

3727
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:19,960
and there's,
there's no cell phone service.

3728
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:23,590
There's no people anywhere near you.
It's a very strange environment.

3729
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:24,970
It is.
It is.

3730
02:27:24,971 --> 02:27:27,220
And it's like everything else gets tuned
out too.

3731
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:31,090
It's like this laser focus of,
of what's happening right then all your

3732
02:27:31,091 --> 02:27:32,650
senses go way up.
I mean,

3733
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:36,160
at least for me as far as smell and like
you can feel the slightest breeze in

3734
02:27:36,161 --> 02:27:38,380
your face and uh,
you know,

3735
02:27:38,381 --> 02:27:40,660
you can see that at,
I'm gonna move really,

3736
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:44,740
really close like you'd never would
notice before because of that laser

3737
02:27:44,741 --> 02:27:48,170
focus intensity just kind of takes over
your whole system and there's some of us

3738
02:27:48,171 --> 02:27:49,720
stock on something.
There's something about tricking an

3739
02:27:49,721 --> 02:27:53,110
animal that's whole focus in life is to
not get caught.

3740
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:57,340
That is a great sense of feeling like
you do everything right in the right

3741
02:27:57,341 --> 02:28:00,820
place and this thing walks by and like,
oh and an Arrow was already on the way.

3742
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:03,070
It's done deal.
It's like you did it.

3743
02:28:03,100 --> 02:28:03,671
I mean you,
you,

3744
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:07,720
you outsmarted something that's 10
million years where the genetics and

3745
02:28:07,721 --> 02:28:08,554
you,
you got to fear,

3746
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:11,500
especially with bow hunting,
like you got it in that close and got

3747
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:12,430
them.
You not only that,

3748
02:28:12,431 --> 02:28:14,480
we're clumsy.
Our noses sock,

3749
02:28:14,530 --> 02:28:17,500
we can't see very good things.
Dog Shit.

3750
02:28:17,830 --> 02:28:21,440
They have ears like satellite dishes.
They're spinning around left and right.

3751
02:28:21,441 --> 02:28:24,470
Looking all over the place.
Trying to find you a mule deer in

3752
02:28:24,471 --> 02:28:25,320
particular.
Yeah,

3753
02:28:25,430 --> 02:28:27,350
those giant ears.
Well and their nose.

3754
02:28:27,410 --> 02:28:28,250
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3755
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:30,800
The power sent this crazy.
Yeah.

3756
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,650
I've seen the craziest stuff at the
farthest distances.

3757
02:28:34,340 --> 02:28:37,520
Hundreds of yards.
Fuck this done.

3758
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:40,900
What do you think the wind's blowing at
your back or on your face?

3759
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:43,430
It's actually going around the mountain
and ends up right back at it.

3760
02:28:43,431 --> 02:28:44,860
It's just amazing what happens.
People are like,

3761
02:28:45,170 --> 02:28:45,921
Oh,
you're out there hunting,

3762
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:48,560
chasing the poor,
defenseless animal eating defenseless.

3763
02:28:48,940 --> 02:28:51,410
And it was the offensive side.
Have a way more big ones.

3764
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:55,160
Right.
I always get them if they were

3765
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:56,150
defenseless,
I mean there,

3766
02:28:56,151 --> 02:28:57,440
there,
there is smart.

3767
02:28:57,640 --> 02:28:59,010
I mean there man,
I've,

3768
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,500
I've seen him,
you know I've,

3769
02:29:00,501 --> 02:29:02,510
I've,
I've hunted animals where they got one

3770
02:29:02,511 --> 02:29:03,860
with you are gone.
Yeah.

3771
02:29:03,930 --> 02:29:06,650
Well and like gone for days.
No gone.

3772
02:29:06,980 --> 02:29:08,180
Never saw him again.
Gone.

3773
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,320
He figured me out.
Gone.

3774
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:11,390
They're round wolves.
Totally.

3775
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:14,150
You know bears mountain lions.
I've seen,

3776
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:15,950
yeah,
I've seen deer do some crazy things like

3777
02:29:15,951 --> 02:29:18,430
lay down on the ground and like hide
from hunters.

3778
02:29:18,660 --> 02:29:22,550
Hunters walk right by him like within
yards and just do some really cool

3779
02:29:22,551 --> 02:29:25,100
stuff.
Sneak away from people and you go,

3780
02:29:25,101 --> 02:29:28,370
those guys never knew their five yards
away from a giant buck and that they

3781
02:29:28,371 --> 02:29:30,440
just totally out smarter than him.
It's the coolest thing.

3782
02:29:31,010 --> 02:29:33,140
Yeah.
There doesn't Denmat dumb humans walking

3783
02:29:33,141 --> 02:29:33,350
by.

3784
02:29:33,350 --> 02:29:34,161
He's like,
no problem.

3785
02:29:34,161 --> 02:29:35,930
I was laid down.
They'll never see me.

3786
02:29:36,200 --> 02:29:40,010
Just imagine if you were a 300 pound
animal that had escaped some them

3787
02:29:40,370 --> 02:29:43,370
killing you all the time.
That's your every day is try to get some

3788
02:29:43,371 --> 02:29:48,050
grass and your system and get the fuck
away from everything that wants to try

3789
02:29:48,051 --> 02:29:51,200
and get laid once a year.
Polygamist yeah,

3790
02:29:51,201 --> 02:29:52,200
definitely not.
You know,

3791
02:29:52,280 --> 02:29:55,160
you're sleeping outside in Montana in
the winter.

3792
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:57,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

3793
02:29:57,890 --> 02:30:02,780
I think it's amazing and we're so lucky
in this country that the people like

3794
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:05,000
Teddy Roosevelt and the people that
founded these,

3795
02:30:05,330 --> 02:30:10,330
these areas for public land,
they set them aside and I'll allow these

3796
02:30:10,371 --> 02:30:13,100
places to,
to be established with these animals can

3797
02:30:13,101 --> 02:30:16,640
live and we never have to worry about
them being taken over and they built

3798
02:30:16,641 --> 02:30:17,690
malls there.
I mean,

3799
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:19,610
it's,
it's a really beautiful part of America.

3800
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:22,250
Even if you don't have any desire
whatsoever to hunt.

3801
02:30:22,490 --> 02:30:27,440
The fact that you can go up there and
backpack and camp and be in that natural

3802
02:30:27,441 --> 02:30:29,060
environment,
it's a really beautiful thing about

3803
02:30:29,061 --> 02:30:29,894
America.
Totally.

3804
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:30,801
Yeah.
I mean,

3805
02:30:30,801 --> 02:30:33,020
the perception of hunters,
we're just out there to kill something.

3806
02:30:33,130 --> 02:30:34,310
That's,
for me,

3807
02:30:34,311 --> 02:30:37,160
it's a small part of the whole thing.
It's a good part though.

3808
02:30:37,490 --> 02:30:40,880
It is.
But it's be an outfit too and it is

3809
02:30:40,881 --> 02:30:44,450
definitely good experience all that.
I mean obviously I wouldn't be there

3810
02:30:44,451 --> 02:30:46,430
without a tag.
I get invited to go hiking or go to a

3811
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:48,400
park all the time or you know,
National Party man,

3812
02:30:48,410 --> 02:30:50,400
I'm not interested.
But I mean it's uh,

3813
02:30:50,660 --> 02:30:52,910
I mean being out in the mountains and
the wilderness and seeing all this stuff

3814
02:30:52,911 --> 02:30:54,380
is just awesome.
Yeah.

3815
02:30:54,381 --> 02:30:56,450
It's not like if you go hunting and it's
unsuccessful,

3816
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:59,570
it's a zero.
It's like a sentence that's like a six

3817
02:30:59,571 --> 02:31:00,560
out of 10.
If you,

3818
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:02,980
if you get a big elk,
it's a 10 but if you,

3819
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:08,000
if you go out there and nothing happens
like us hiking's a four so it's two

3820
02:31:08,331 --> 02:31:10,220
points above a hike.
Hiking,

3821
02:31:10,221 --> 02:31:11,960
we call it.
Especially if you actually see the

3822
02:31:11,961 --> 02:31:13,400
animals.
If you don't see the animals,

3823
02:31:13,401 --> 02:31:15,320
it's like a five.
If you don't see anything,

3824
02:31:15,380 --> 02:31:16,970
you're like,
what the fuck were we doing in this box?

3825
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:18,620
If you don't see anything,
you need new friends.

3826
02:31:19,410 --> 02:31:20,030
Yes.

3827
02:31:20,030 --> 02:31:23,430
Somebody somebodies been lying to you or
he just,

3828
02:31:23,431 --> 02:31:24,600
something happened,
you know,

3829
02:31:24,630 --> 02:31:27,000
you never know.
Now these big horn sheep,

3830
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:29,790
they're very difficult to get a tag for
right in Montana.

3831
02:31:29,791 --> 02:31:32,590
Like there's so many of them now though.
Um,

3832
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:33,211
yeah,
it's,

3833
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:34,890
but I mean there's still not enough to
go around.

3834
02:31:34,891 --> 02:31:35,790
It's,
it's the most,

3835
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:37,620
it's the most exclusive tag in the
world.

3836
02:31:37,621 --> 02:31:40,650
How many do they give out in Montana to
get about 150 a year?

3837
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:42,510
I drew one last year.
Oh Wow.

3838
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:47,160
I mean the odds in the best place at
like one in 500 it's a lottery system.

3839
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:50,820
And then the lodge,
like in the roughest areas that have

3840
02:31:50,821 --> 02:31:55,080
better odds are like one in 101 and 500
that's incredible.

3841
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:58,680
So Brennan drew a sheep tag or Montana
to hunt one sheep.

3842
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,500
Yup.
You had one unit?

3843
02:32:01,570 --> 02:32:03,570
Yeah,
he showed me the picture of it when he

3844
02:32:03,571 --> 02:32:05,070
drew the tag goes,
I'm going to kill the sheep.

3845
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:06,710
How did you know that?
About the show?

3846
02:32:06,711 --> 02:32:08,190
That he killed it.
The sheeps dead?

3847
02:32:08,310 --> 02:32:09,300
Yeah.
You're a savage.

3848
02:32:09,940 --> 02:32:10,810
Oh,
was like the,

3849
02:32:10,850 --> 02:32:12,600
I'm so glad I'm not that cheap right
now.

3850
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:14,430
When you do that tag,
when they,

3851
02:32:14,490 --> 02:32:18,000
when they lose their mind once a year,
they come out to the winter range and a

3852
02:32:18,001 --> 02:32:21,060
buddy of mine,
Robbie doctor had found this ram on the

3853
02:32:21,061 --> 02:32:24,240
winter range and she sent me a picture
of it and said,

3854
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:25,400
dude,
you know,

3855
02:32:25,530 --> 02:32:28,880
this is a huge ram in an unusual area.
And uh,

3856
02:32:28,940 --> 02:32:29,940
we applied for it.
I mean,

3857
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:31,260
it's happened before like,
oh,

3858
02:32:31,261 --> 02:32:32,490
there's a big sheep.
Nobody knows that.

3859
02:32:32,491 --> 02:32:35,280
We didn't tell anybody.
And then he showed up again the next

3860
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:36,120
year.
It didn't draw the tag.

3861
02:32:36,450 --> 02:32:39,270
And then last year I drew it and it was
like I drew the tag and I was like,

3862
02:32:39,271 --> 02:32:41,940
he's on the outer edge of the life
expectancy of a sheep.

3863
02:32:42,420 --> 02:32:44,250
You know,
it's a 500 square mile area.

3864
02:32:44,251 --> 02:32:48,540
I'm going in there.
As long as it takes 500 square miles,

3865
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:51,330
the Hud one sheet mindblowing.
That's pretty great.

3866
02:32:51,340 --> 02:32:52,290
Think about that.
Well,

3867
02:32:52,291 --> 02:32:53,910
that is the ultimate pursuit,
right?

3868
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:57,510
While talking about the most difficult
challenge of hunting with a bow.

3869
02:32:57,660 --> 02:32:59,280
Yeah.
How many are you getting from,

3870
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:03,270
uh,
just outside my effective range?

3871
02:33:03,330 --> 02:33:05,820
Long shot.
Like I snuck in,

3872
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:09,070
I snuck in at 15 yards for 20 minutes.
It took me 24 days to find him.

3873
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:11,910
I,
I passed up 33 eight year old or better

3874
02:33:11,911 --> 02:33:13,600
rams.
Two days you spent scouting to,

3875
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:16,380
oh,
I mean I lost track of time.

3876
02:33:16,381 --> 02:33:17,430
I mean I put,
I put on,

3877
02:33:17,610 --> 02:33:20,010
I mean,
I'm a crazy amount of job.

3878
02:33:20,011 --> 02:33:21,210
Do you have,
we all need one of those.

3879
02:33:22,590 --> 02:33:24,330
He said,
he said he's like,

3880
02:33:24,870 --> 02:33:25,730
when,
when,

3881
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:26,471
when I was like,
dude,

3882
02:33:26,471 --> 02:33:28,500
I,
I drew the tag and like I was emotional.

3883
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:30,600
I drew it like,
I mean people don't understand like,

3884
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:31,650
oh,
you got to tag the hunt.

3885
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:36,651
This thing,
it's like 25 years in a row of knows how

3886
02:33:36,751 --> 02:33:39,660
many people put in for the tag.
And there's 150 tags available.

3887
02:33:39,661 --> 02:33:42,090
So we just 150 tags in the whole state,
the whole state.

3888
02:33:42,091 --> 02:33:44,430
And how many people in this area?
Two tags.

3889
02:33:44,730 --> 02:33:48,480
So you got one of two to 220 people
applied for two tags.

3890
02:33:48,481 --> 02:33:49,460
And I drew one.
Wow.

3891
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:51,420
It was like amazing.
And you know,

3892
02:33:51,421 --> 02:33:53,520
and I,
I had a picture of this ram and like he

3893
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:57,450
had showed up on the winter range and
then disappeared into this abyss called

3894
02:33:57,451 --> 02:33:59,340
the Bob Marshall Wilderness.
And it's like,

3895
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,510
I'm going to go in there and find them.
And how many total days we hunting?

3896
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:04,583
Oh,
I mean,

3897
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:05,670
24 days,
honey.

3898
02:34:05,710 --> 02:34:08,430
I 124 days.
I kind of scouting days you had was like

3899
02:34:08,431 --> 02:34:09,450
ridiculous.
Yeah.

3900
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:12,400
So you're going back and getting food
and going back to him soon.

3901
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:15,240
Four or five days at a time.
And like all good things,

3902
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:17,830
you know,
like all the most amazing things.

3903
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:18,970
You know,
timing is kind of a bitch.

3904
02:34:18,971 --> 02:34:23,350
We had a baby due
in the middle of my wife.

3905
02:34:23,351 --> 02:34:26,860
We're fucking kill him right out there
chasing one if did you see any of the

3906
02:34:26,861 --> 02:34:27,341
rams?
Yeah,

3907
02:34:27,341 --> 02:34:30,340
but there wasn't quite big enough.
Third,

3908
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:34,180
a third 33 I passed up 33 rounds before
I push.

3909
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:37,920
Hold on a solid.
Yeah.

3910
02:34:40,430 --> 02:34:41,680
Yeah.
So,

3911
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:44,050
yeah,
I mean it was after this one cheap and I

3912
02:34:44,051 --> 02:34:45,730
thought,
and you know,

3913
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:47,650
like when you talk about really getting
to know animals,

3914
02:34:47,651 --> 02:34:50,860
he had showed up on the winter range and
twice we had pictures of him two years

3915
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:52,510
around on the winter range.
And it's just like,

3916
02:34:52,511 --> 02:34:53,770
okay,
we got a picture of this big ramp.

3917
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:56,140
Well,
what I started looking at the pictures

3918
02:34:56,150 --> 02:35:01,150
and comparing them and all of a sudden I
noticed that in in one picture from 2013

3919
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:06,900
or from 2012 and one in 2013 he had the
same two young rams with them a year

3920
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:10,060
apart,
10 miles apart in distance,

3921
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:12,460
and he had the same two sheep with them.
So all of a sudden I'm like,

3922
02:35:13,030 --> 02:35:14,110
you know,
most people would be like,

3923
02:35:14,140 --> 02:35:14,900
oh,
it's just a sheep.

3924
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,280
And it was a little half curl.
And then there's a young kind of unique

3925
02:35:18,281 --> 02:35:20,980
look and ran with them and I'm like,
it's the same room.

3926
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,740
So all of a sudden I got a Ram band that
I'm looking for there.

3927
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:25,780
You know,
it's kind of a symbiotic relationship.

3928
02:35:25,781 --> 02:35:30,130
Young rams allow old rams or old rams
allow young rams to follow them around.

3929
02:35:30,160 --> 02:35:33,010
They show him kind of the hills and they
kind of tolerate them.

3930
02:35:33,011 --> 02:35:34,210
It's not like,
Hey,

3931
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:36,670
you're my buddy or anything.
They just kind of like when when the

3932
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:40,300
census start to slip,
you'll see old rams with young rams and

3933
02:35:40,330 --> 02:35:41,920
they're keeping an eye on their back for
him.

3934
02:35:41,921 --> 02:35:46,750
And I see.
So I figured out this Ram who was 13

3935
02:35:46,751 --> 02:35:48,160
years old,
which is the oldest,

3936
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:51,340
so I end up killing him obviously.
And he was 13 years old,

3937
02:35:51,341 --> 02:35:54,430
which is the oldest ram killed the whole
state of 150 by two years.

3938
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:57,130
So he's beyond,
he's off the charts old.

3939
02:35:57,520 --> 02:35:59,370
So he had these two young rams with him.

3940
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:00,940
So I,
I I,

3941
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:03,100
you know,
basically you have known enough about

3942
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:04,090
she behavior.
I was like,

3943
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,040
okay,
I'm looking for this old ram and this

3944
02:36:06,041 --> 02:36:08,080
massive area,
but I'm actually looking for three sheet

3945
02:36:08,081 --> 02:36:11,080
because if I see either of those two
young rams without him,

3946
02:36:11,081 --> 02:36:13,870
I'll know he's dead and it makes a big
difference in 500 square miles.

3947
02:36:13,871 --> 02:36:15,850
Look for three sheet versus one.
Apparently.

3948
02:36:15,870 --> 02:36:18,310
Huh.
So I still retain.

3949
02:36:18,330 --> 02:36:20,950
So I went in there and I was like,
I'm going to go find every sheep and the

3950
02:36:20,951 --> 02:36:22,660
entire unit.
And I went in there and I found,

3951
02:36:22,690 --> 02:36:26,350
I thoroughly believe that I found every
single sheep in there.

3952
02:36:26,351 --> 02:36:29,770
I counted almost 50 more sheep than the
biologist thought was alive in there.

3953
02:36:31,530 --> 02:36:34,810
And
do you take photos of these?

3954
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:36,840
Oh yeah.
The bottle to the biologists.

3955
02:36:36,890 --> 02:36:37,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

3956
02:36:37,811 --> 02:36:39,610
It's,
he's kind of changed his management plan

3957
02:36:39,611 --> 02:36:40,420
in the area a little bit.

3958
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:42,650
Like he knows more about it.
I mean it's,

3959
02:36:44,130 --> 02:36:47,500
it's like I went in there because,
you know,

3960
02:36:47,501 --> 02:36:49,330
for,
since I was a little kid,

3961
02:36:49,331 --> 02:36:49,931
it was like,
man,

3962
02:36:49,931 --> 02:36:52,840
that's something I always wanted to do
and then you're going to get this

3963
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:53,650
opportunity.
It was like,

3964
02:36:53,650 --> 02:36:54,920
I'm not going to go do the easiest
thing.

3965
02:36:54,921 --> 02:36:56,200
I mean,
I passed big rams,

3966
02:36:56,201 --> 02:36:58,780
a big rams of my bowl,
but I wanted this ram.

3967
02:36:58,781 --> 02:37:02,080
I wanted to have like an epic con and
just to see if I could do it,

3968
02:37:02,081 --> 02:37:04,180
see if I could find it.
And uh,

3969
02:37:04,600 --> 02:37:07,240
and I hadn't found those young rams.
And on the 23rd day,

3970
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:09,790
I said it,
heard him pop and heads started glass

3971
02:37:09,791 --> 02:37:11,560
and cutting the timber apart and all of
a sudden,

3972
02:37:12,050 --> 02:37:13,690
you know,
another key to the puzzle.

3973
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:16,160
All of a sudden there's that little
young ram that was with

3974
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:17,900
him standing in the timber.
Boom.

3975
02:37:17,901 --> 02:37:21,170
I got him go down there,
there's 10 rams in there and my ram

3976
02:37:21,171 --> 02:37:21,981
walks out.
That's him.

3977
02:37:21,981 --> 02:37:23,390
You know,
it took me two days to kill him,

3978
02:37:23,391 --> 02:37:25,870
but I found them.
And you doing all this by yourself?

3979
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:26,611
Um,
I had a,

3980
02:37:26,611 --> 02:37:30,530
I had my buddy that originally found the
sheep when I found the rams,

3981
02:37:30,531 --> 02:37:31,460
I called him.
He's,

3982
02:37:31,461 --> 02:37:34,730
he had a regular job and uh,
it was about a 10 mile,

3983
02:37:34,770 --> 02:37:37,160
uh,
is about a 10 hour hike and he hiked in

3984
02:37:37,520 --> 02:37:40,280
to help me hand signal and kill it.
That's a good friend,

3985
02:37:40,340 --> 02:37:43,790
right?
Who Hiking 10 fucking hours for you.

3986
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:45,440
My friends be like,
dude,

3987
02:37:45,441 --> 02:37:47,950
uh,
my wife just told me I gotta go on

3988
02:37:50,230 --> 02:37:53,540
hiking.
I call impact it out for you.

3989
02:37:53,950 --> 02:37:55,430
But yeah,
it's a good friend.

3990
02:37:55,431 --> 02:37:57,080
He found the ram originally and then,
yeah,

3991
02:37:57,081 --> 02:37:59,460
and I,
I called him and he disappeared,

3992
02:37:59,490 --> 02:38:00,050
you know,
he,

3993
02:38:00,050 --> 02:38:02,900
he jumped off of work like,
like his wife was in labor,

3994
02:38:03,500 --> 02:38:05,810
you know,
Jesus Christ like I to go,

3995
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,570
you guys don't like the same breeding
cycle like rambling or his wife was

3996
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:09,710
like,
he left like that.

3997
02:38:09,710 --> 02:38:10,491
Like it was like,
Hey,

3998
02:38:10,491 --> 02:38:11,930
my buddy found the ram,
I got to go.

3999
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:12,731
And,
and his word,

4000
02:38:12,731 --> 02:38:13,700
you know,
it's a Montana thing.

4001
02:38:13,701 --> 02:38:15,710
He's like the guys that he works with
her like,

4002
02:38:15,711 --> 02:38:16,401
yeah.
Oh Man.

4003
02:38:16,401 --> 02:38:18,490
You got your wife was ready to pop and
no,

4004
02:38:18,500 --> 02:38:19,550

we had had the baby.

4005
02:38:19,610 --> 02:38:20,560
Oh,
you'd already high left.

4006
02:38:20,570 --> 02:38:21,320
Yeah,
I left.

4007
02:38:21,320 --> 02:38:23,090
We had the baby September 11.
So I had left,

4008
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,740
uh,
like seven days.

4009
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:25,850
Um,
I,

4010
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:28,640
I went out and we had the baby.
Everything was great.

4011
02:38:29,120 --> 02:38:31,220
And then you left right after the baby
was born.

4012
02:38:32,060 --> 02:38:35,220
It's even worse.
You sleep at all.

4013
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:38,540
You don't want my wife.
I mean,

4014
02:38:38,541 --> 02:38:40,670
she was just like a couple of days like,
you know,

4015
02:38:40,671 --> 02:38:42,340
we've got everything settled back in and
she was,

4016
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:45,770
she was basically like,
get the fuck Outta here.

4017
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:47,390
Wow.
His wife's amazing.

4018
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:48,550
That's amazing.
Yeah.

4019
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:50,570
She gets it.
Well that's a good story to end this

I appreciate about what you guys do,

4021
02:38:54,800 --> 02:38:58,520

10th of the one percenters of the

4022
02:38:58,521 --> 02:39:03,521
outliers of the crazy people that are
pursuing this as a just an incredibly

4023
02:39:04,791 --> 02:39:06,740
difficult biological puzzle.

4024
02:39:06,770 --> 02:39:07,730
It is,
you know.

4025
02:39:07,731 --> 02:39:09,230
