1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,730
Here we go.
Freaks.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,940
I forgot to write that on twitter,
so I'm doing that right now.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:08,820
Yeah,
I'm,

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm real bad at that to say we're 
starting.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,210
Yeah,
well I'm real bad at tweeting right 

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,161
before we start,
I always forget

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,380
and now I'm doing it.
No bitches or does it to Rogan talk?

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,990
No,
it's ustream dot TV slash board slash 

9
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:33,860
Joe Rogan.
Yeah.

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,810
Hey,
I'm here all weekend.

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
I'm here all week except Tuesday.
You're having a conversation in the 

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,391
middle of a podcast stoner boy.
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,100
was sponsored by squarespace.
Squarespace is an all in one web making 

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,290
platform,
website making platform on the web.

15
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Um,
squarespace has it set up so that with 

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,680
the normal skills that people acquire by
using computers like drag and drop and 

17
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:07,630
copy and paste and point and click,
you can do all that shit.

18
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,480
You can make a bad ass professional 
looking website.

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,740
It literally and figuratively is that 
easy.

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,220
Um,
squarespace has a bunch of different 

21
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,980
beautiful designs for you start with,
you can use your own images.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,370
They offer 24 slash seven support and 
you can set up an online store that very

23
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:31,861
easily you can set up an online store 
for music as well if you sell music or 

24
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,760
even if you sell comedy,
like if you,

25
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,100
uh,
were selling digital downloads,

26
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,750
they can set that up for you as well.

27
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,680
Um,
squarespace has a new logo creator where

28
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:46,390
you can create a clean and simple logo 
design for yourself in minutes.

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,980
Um,
it's really interesting.

30
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,460
I have had nothing but positive feedback
from squarespace.

31
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,180
Anybody that have turned onto it is a,
has,

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,250
becomes a huge fan once you start using 
it and they're so confident about it 

33
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,191
that they allow you to use squarespace 
without entering your credit card 

34
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,340
information first.
And then when you say,

35
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,780
you know what,
this is fucking awesome.

36
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,990
Then you enter in your credit card 
information and then you actually get 

37
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,721
charged for it.
So they'll let you try it out and see 

38
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:12,721
what the website would look like.
Um,

39
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:14,530
it's just really impressive.
Um,

40
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:17,530
we had a contest and we've talked about 
this,

41
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:22,531
but I'll just say it again.
It was really kind of unfair because 

42
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,980
there were so many different people made
awesome websites.

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,410
To pick four is that we picked four to 
pick four,

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,050
so it's not.
It's not fair.

45
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,880
There was too many guns.
I met some comics are talking about that

46
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:35,881
in New York.
They were entering into some cottons of 

47
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:38,571
the contest.
There was too many people that have 

48
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:38,620
awesome websites,
but we picked some wicked ones.

49
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,450
Point is these are not people that have 
ever done anything like that before.

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,280
There are people that for the most part,
believe for web designers.

51
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,860
I think there were just folks.
I might be wrong about that.

52
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,340
Either way they use squarespace to do it
and you can too.

53
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,310
It's not like they get magic access to 
special tools.

54
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,820
A squarespace.
If you there for a free trial and 10 

55
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,760
percent off your purchase,
go to squarespace.com

56
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,810
and enter in the code word Joe.
That's squarespace.com

57
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,830
and enter the code word Joe.
A really awesome way to create your own 

58
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,830
website.

59
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,570
I couldn't be happier with 
squarespace.com.

60
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,360
What he says your.
I love TSA cock.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,150
That's the new new website,
by the way,

62
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,151
that's a website now that's done.
So what Brian did that during the time 

63
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:31,270
that we did that commercial,
he made a website.

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,060
It's pretty ridiculous name.
He just puts it in poop.

65
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm speaking of websites stamps.
Dot Com is another awesome website that 

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,610
you can use to stay to save a lot of 
bullshit in your life.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Stamps.com
allows you to weigh print way your 

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,810
packages,
print them with official US postage on a

69
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:52,390
regular home computer.
Apply it to your package.

70
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,340
Mailman comes,
he handed off to them,

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
boom.
The rates change.

72
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,340
Stamps.com
has it covered.

73
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,640
If you don't have to worry about God,
I forgot they went up ten cents this 

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:02,640
week.
Are you?

75
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,560
It's all in.
They figured it out for you and with 

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,291
stamps.com,
it takes away all the hassle of waiting 

77
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,771
in line,
dealing with someone at the post office 

78
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:14,380
and weighing each individual package.

79
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,380
You could do it all naked and drunk and 
the comfort of your own home and nobody 

80
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,371
can say shit and it works.
It's a beautiful thing and if you enter 

81
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:28,381
in the code word j r e in that little 
microphone in the upper right hand 

82
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,050
corner of the old school microphone 
entering the Code Word Jr,

83
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,070
he you'll get $110 bonus offer which 
includes a digital scale and up to $55 

84
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,460
or free postage,
so that stamps.com.

85
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,461
Before you do anything,
click on the microphone at the top of 

86
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:44,730
the homepage and type in J R,
e stamps.com

87
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,440
is with Brian Red band uses to send 
those desk squad dot,

88
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:52,441
t v t shirts if you're like,
I see these sweet little kitty cat tee 

89
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:52,510
shirts,
but I don't know where to buy them.

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,830
It's [inaudible] Dot TV and when you get
them they will be used by stamps.com.

91
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,390
That's all it'll be sent to you.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,600
So think of that bitch stamps.
ICOMP jre were also brought to you by 

93
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,551
[inaudible] dot com.
That's o n n I t a human optimization 

94
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:13,201
website.
We we strive to send you things that 

95
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:15,280
work and send you things that make your 
body function better.

96
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,760
What are the ones that keep you up?
Is that,

97
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,060
that doesn't keep you up.
Wake you up,

98
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,860
wake you up.
I think you're thinking,

99
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,680
what are you thinking of when you're 
tired for radio?

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,510
Are you thinking of like,
um,

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,820
like you,
that can do that,

102
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,821
but if you thinking of that,
are you thinking of a drug you think it 

103
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:37,180
was that Joel,
do you know what I'm talking about?

104
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,350
Is that what you're thinking of?
Oh No,

105
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:40,450
what is that?
That's the stuff that keeps you awake.

106
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,820
That is a prescriber to narcolepsy 
people over.

107
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,650
And if you,
uh,

108
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,050
yeah,
and if you're feeling sleepy and you pop

109
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:48,970
one of those bitches,
it goes away.

110
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,970
Really just totally goes away.
It's been in it.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,580
It gives a soldiers,
I'm sure they give him the soldiers.

112
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:59,581
They probably eat them like candy and 
they throw in steroid apple with all 

113
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:00,770
these holes in it.
Special Apple.

114
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,550
Yeah.
That stuff is uh,

115
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:06,950
they did some cap difficult for sure.
Probably do some captain America Shit to

116
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:11,951
soldiers.
I just tried to get new video from my 

117
00:06:11,951 --> 00:06:12,140
drug dealer.
He's got to get any pill and I'm like,

118
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,000
all right,
get me nuvigil.

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,060
I'm really.
And he's like,

120
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,080
yeah man,
it hasn't hit.

121
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,460
We haven't gotten any of those.
Oh,

122
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,550
he doesn't know what it is.
You can buy it online.

123
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:21,100
Then.
I know there's a thread.

124
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,230
There's a whole thread on the 
underground and really how to buy 

125
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,230
provigil online.
Yeah.

126
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,190
Provigil or luke vigil.
Totally legal.

127
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,370
Which one's better?
I told him.

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,440
No,
that's a good question.

129
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,400
I've only tried new vigil.
That's what I gave you.

130
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:37,401
A new visual.
You've got some other stuff too from on 

131
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:39,871
it.
Like Alpha brain one 81 80 is one new 

132
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,520
mood powder that you put in a drain.
It gets you more alert.

133
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,870
Yeah,
it's one 80.

134
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,490
That's great.
I love it.

135
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,930
It's this stuff.
It's in these.

136
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:48,560
Yeah,
they're great.

137
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,790
I'd take the.
Okay.

138
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I gave it to you before.
You drink two of those motherfuckers 

139
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,720
before every UFC.
It's great.

140
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,040
Really?
Yes.

141
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,160
Well listen man,
we had alpha brains in those and Alpha 

142
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,430
brain is the big one for me.
How long until it kicks in?

143
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,050
Oh,
just like an hour.

144
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:10,280
So it kicks in well,
it's just nutrients,

145
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,260
you know,
it's not like kick it in like a drug.

146
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,360
It has an effect,
Don your memory.

147
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,510
It has an effect on certain aspects of 
your,

148
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:23,511
uh,
your ability to execute tasks and sit 

149
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:23,511
and chill.

150
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:26,460
It's for jetlag all nighters,
hangovers and pity parties party on 

151
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,730
that.
We're not lying.

152
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,490
Fuck.
That needs nutrients.

153
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:36,910
We all know people like that.
I'm busy having a pity party says that 

154
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,440
on that pity party.
This was a smiley face on the course.

155
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,830
Does.
Why do you think they just didn't have 

156
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:50,930
one next one to put on there?
So they decided,

157
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,210
oh,
let's just throw pity parties.

158
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,330
They didn't have an extra one.
It's just,

159
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,920
that's the perfect thing to have on 
there,

160
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,840
right thing.
It's the right thing to say if you have 

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,211
an API party plan.
I remember just like yelling at you 

162
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:04,211
guys.
And I'm like,

163
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm cranky because I'm tired.
Claims that's what's happening right 

164
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,230
now.
Yeah,

165
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,150
you gotta learn how to handle that shit.
One of the best ways to handle that shit

166
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,430
is with health.
Second best way.

167
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
There were pity party.

168
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,410
If,
uh,

169
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:22,320
if you take a Alpha brain or if you take
one and you're having a pity party,

170
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,870
but you're also giving yourself some 
nutrients,

171
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,530
all pity parties are putting nutrients.
Go in there.

172
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,720
It's a bunch of shit.
I'm in Alpha brain.

173
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,610
It's um,
Alpha brain.

174
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:32,860
Uh,
we,

175
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,590
we recently got done with the,
uh,

176
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,750
the,
the first results published a clinical 

177
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,261
test of a Alpha brain,
double blind placebo tests and showed 

178
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:47,061
positive results.
We printed it all up on [inaudible] dot 

179
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:47,061
com.
The,

180
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:47,810
um,
the things there for anybody to,

181
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,160
uh,
to go investigate and check it out.

182
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:55,170
And we're in the middle of a much larger
scale to this was the first one was 

183
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,920
something called a pilot test with a 
pilot test.

184
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,950
You only use 20 people had a couple,
dropped out,

185
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,000
three dropped out,
I believe.

186
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,520
So I think we were left with 17 or 16.

187
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,120
I can't remember exactly where they just
get lazy up,

188
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,310
just give up they want to do anymore.
But the people that stayed,

189
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,740
that used Alpha brain showed an 
improvement.

190
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,430
They showed improvement in memory.
Um,

191
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I,
I don't want to read the things that 

192
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,500
don't totally understand how these 
things work.

193
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,800
I've had explained it,
explained to me many ways,

194
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,950
but you could view it all.
Anybody who's interested view at all and

195
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,920
view all the ingredients.
We also offer a 100 percent,

196
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,310
90,
90 day 30 pill moneyback guarantee on 

197
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,780
Alpha brain or any of the supplements 
because they are controversial.

198
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,810
There's plenty of science behind all of 
these individual ingredients that we 

199
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,780
use,
whether it's an Alpha brain,

200
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:44,781
whether it's a new mood,
there's evidence along with the study 

201
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:46,350
results along with references.
All those,

202
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,380
everything that we could find about it 
that's imperative that people be 

203
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,020
educated about.

204
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,210
We have printed up on [inaudible] dot 
com.

205
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,680
So if you're interested in it and you're
like,

206
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,050
what is this horseshit?
Is this snake oil?

207
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Be At least relieved in the fact that 
there's a 100 percent money back 

208
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,980
guarantee in the first 30 pills for 90 
days.

209
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,810
You have 100 percent.
You don't have to return the pills.

210
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,330
He just say this stuff didn't work and 
you get your money back.

211
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:11,010
You don't have to send back anything.
Oh really?

212
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,480
Yes.
Because we're not.

213
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,110
I don't want to reuse them.
No one's gonna.

214
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,300
Look at whatever they gonna do the grab 
bag.

215
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,220
Yeah.
I'm not going to.

216
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,620
We're not going to destroy it,
but we don't even want,

217
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:23,280
you know,
we don't.

218
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,880
You could.
The idea behind it is the idea that if 

219
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,140
you enjoy something,
like at least I do.

220
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,200
If I enjoy something,
I want to buy it.

221
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,750
That's how I feel like whether it's a 
want anybody's money.

222
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,330
I didn't like it anyway.
Exactly,

223
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,750
exactly.
And I'm,

224
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,830
I'm honest about it.
I love this stuff.

225
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,260
I've taken all the time.
If it wasn't for that,

226
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,440
I would.
I get a little nervous if I have to do 

227
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,740
something and I don't have it.
They're not that I need it,

228
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,920
but that I know that it has a benefit.
It just does.

229
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,350
Not that I need.
It sounds like a drug addict,

230
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,200
but I'm saying it is very much like a 
drug addict.

231
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm a drug addict for healthy shit.
Yeah.

232
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,430
Oh yeah.
You are totally what?

233
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,490
Sure.
Somewhere what's an ideal heart rate 

234
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,641
when you're working at a thousand?
Like you don't want to go over 180 is 

235
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,250
probably about as high as you ever want 
to go.

236
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,770
What are you up to?
One 71 80.

237
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:24,771
You know,
you're fucking red line and shit on the 

238
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:24,771
clips on their fingers.

239
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:28,850
Now.
It's like when they have those little 

240
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:28,850
things you put your hands on when you're
working out those accurate.

241
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,490
Yeah,
those are accurate.

242
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,750
You have.
I mean you can go over one 80 about 

243
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,431
probably the most anybody ever doesn't 
in athletic competition and I would 

244
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,530
guess it's probably like in the two 
hundreds of like the early 200,

245
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,040
like maybe to 10.
Let's see.

246
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,720
Let's be frightened as people are.
What's the highest?

247
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:48,090
Yeah.
Because I know there's an ideal heart 

248
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,001
rate that you want to just kind of like 
coast stat as much as possible and 

249
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:50,790
really that just like shreds through 
calories more than.

250
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,010
Right.
You just keep that going.

251
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,460
Right.
But I'm also,

252
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:00,820
I was looking at,
I was looking at the guy next to me and 

253
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,621
he tried,
he did his and he was like one 62 and 

254
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:02,621
I'm like,
Oh shit.

255
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,270
You know what's the.
He was about the thought.

256
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I really like him.

257
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,780
Yeah,
that's ridiculous.

258
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,830
That's died of a heart attack or just he
just dot,

259
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,560
okay,
here's the,

260
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,880
here's your maximum heart rate.
If you're 20 years old,

261
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,670
up to 100.
Seventy pounds is,

262
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:19,810
um,
it's 200 planes.

263
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,920
Neither of those two things don't.
Wait,

264
00:12:22,921 --> 00:12:25,600
do I just doubled that?
Uh,

265
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,090
I,
I read this incorrectly.

266
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,600
It's not up to 170 pounds.
It doesn't have the pounds factor.

267
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:33,600
Then it's actually a,
your target rate.

268
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:38,601
Heart zone is one of them.
And the other one was your predicted 

269
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:40,300
maximum heart rate.
So your target raise between 1:20

270
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,310
and one slash 70 if you're 20 years old.
I just gave it a cursory glance and your

271
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:48,780
maximum is somewhere around 200.
And as you get older,

272
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:53,100
your maximum drops and drops and drops.
Yeah.

273
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,210
Well,
you're fucking dying.

274
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,590
That freaks me out.
I guess it goes away.

275
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,970
Well,
you've got to start slow.

276
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,350
Dude.
You haven't been working out.

277
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,900
If you're really going to.
That's one thing that I always stress.

278
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,880
If anybody says,
hey man,

279
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,470
I want to start doing kettlebells,
please.

280
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,660
Whatever you do,
start slow,

281
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:14,040
get some light weights and just work on 
the form and work on getting it down and

282
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:17,340
then do it so that you can do 15 of 
those comfortably.

283
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:21,930
Then bumped yourself up to 35 pounds.
Then pump yourself up again and you know

284
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,750
x amount of months later,
but do it slowly.

285
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:27,240
If you do it slowly,
you will get strong like,

286
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:30,060
everybody's got this idea.
I go to fucking do it all today.

287
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,600
Don't do it all today.
Don't do it slowly.

288
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,840
Work on your form.
Learn the movements and yeah,

289
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,690
it's not going to feel like an 
unbelievable workout.

290
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,040
The first,
you know x amount of times you do it,

291
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,220
but ultimately you're going to build up 
and you're going to get yourself into a 

292
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,830
position where your muscles are 
protected to.

293
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,710
You're doing heavy shit and your body's 
not used to it.

294
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,960
You want to make sure that your joints 
are stable.

295
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:54,570
You want to make sure that your core is 
strong.

296
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:59,810
You want to take care of all these 
different problem areas that the worst 

297
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,700
thing that can happen is if you're doing
like a strength and conditioning workout

298
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,820
is you fucking hurt yourself because 
then you're just going to get bombed out

299
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:08,670
about exercise.
You're going to gain more weight.

300
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,110
You're going to have a pity party.

301
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,250
You guys agree with any of this guys,
you're,

302
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,230
you're not in shape.
You need to get in shape right now.

303
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:18,120
Do it today.
Get it done today.

304
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,420
Reach for the stars.
Don't become like pinette.

305
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:25,450
Do extra work getting shaped today.
Don't listen to the losers like Joe 

306
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,140
Rogan,
who doesn't it

307
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,520
the heart.
They're going through a real workout.

308
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,320
The real problem.
The real problem with all this,

309
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,590
um,
you know,

310
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,560
is that people have to ramp up and 
that's what people have a hard time 

311
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,390
doing.
You do ultimately have to ramp up,

312
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,210
like you got to start slow,
but yeah,

313
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,820
it's going to be fine in the beginning,
but I'm telling you right now,

314
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,830
it's going to be fucking hell if you do 
it right.

315
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,980
If you really want to get in shape,
you're going to have to go through the

316
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,860
fires and if you're not willing to go 
through the fires,

317
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,130
you're going to always maintain a 
certain level of fitness.

318
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,440
You're never going to get really strong.
You're never going to get really fast.

319
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:08,441
You're never going to get in good shape.
You got to be able to push yourself but 

320
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:09,260
do it correctly.
But if you do do it,

321
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,230
Goddamn you'll feel better.
Everything will work better.

322
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,970
What did you do that?
Well,

323
00:15:13,971 --> 00:15:15,890
because this is my first time back in 
two years,

324
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,130
so I just did 20 minutes on the 
elliptical,

325
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,810
but at a high level,
you know,

326
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,060
but so it was like I was climbing a 
mountain type thing.

327
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,090
Was your body like,
what the fuck is it got to a point where

328
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,310
my,
my legs felt numb.

329
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,600
Like I felt like,
oh shit,

330
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:31,970
I can't feel my legs anymore.
I don't want to fall down.

331
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,740
And then I just did the machines where I
started from one machine and we went 

332
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,440
through all the machines and did like a 
five,

333
00:15:39,441 --> 00:15:43,820
seven minute reps of all of them.
Have all force yourself to do this.

334
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,720
I smelled a battle rope.
They had one there.

335
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,420
Yeah.
I just want to see it with some of those

336
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,910
are battle ropes.
Oh,

337
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,480
I thought those were like tie you up 
ropes.

338
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,680
Oh,
Ari,

339
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,250
they look all night.
No,

340
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,650
those are the ones on the far left are 
the heavy shipyard ones.

341
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,530
They're pretty dope.
We have a bunch of different weights and

342
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:05,210
sizes,
but a 40 inch ones or the 50 inch ones.

343
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,790
Men Get their fucking fun.
That's subliminal.

344
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,360
They're like,
yeah,

345
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:13,361
you got the little.
Might pretty pony rope or do you got 

346
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:15,730
like that mean danger like yellow black.
Pretty pony rope is like,

347
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,100
that's for girls.
Let's be real.

348
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,810
It's for girls and very weak men or 
incentive to not,

349
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,240
you know,
not want to use prince's road.

350
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,560
You should make videos of.
People have really scrawny dude's doing 

351
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,431
this badly.
Like guys get the reporters from vice 

352
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,670
fellows with glasses in there for Doris,
Doris,

353
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,510
but door keeps falling off.
They keep putting it back on workout for

354
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,340
one.

355
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,590
Sylaria a crunchy thing in my goal,
but lost that when I do like the weight 

356
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,501
room,
lifting things above my head makes like 

357
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:02,750
a clicking noise in my right elbow.
As long as it doesn't hurt,

358
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,570
don't worry about it.
Probably some shit broken loose in there

359
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:10,571
from all your years of battling were 
leaning on tables.

360
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

361
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,180
There's probably some calcium chips.
Um,

362
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,020
this guy,
uh,

363
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,820
that fights in the UFC.
Shocker Ray,

364
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,050
who's a really high level Jujitsu guys,
very famous Jujitsu guy.

365
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,320
He just had all these pieces of meat 
removed from his elbow and they took 

366
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,160
photos of it.
Pull up the photos of your five,

367
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,640
me a c,
a r e s a elbow surgery and see if you 

368
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:37,730
find images because the images,
they had pictures of the um,

369
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,900
the amount of stuff that they polled far
left far left.

370
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,760
Yeah,
that's it right there.

371
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,370
That was in there.
I was in his elbow.

372
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,890
That was all the stuff that they pulled 
out of his elbow.

373
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:55,350
Corn does,
it looks like garlic and teeth and he,

374
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,560
um,
he fucking won.

375
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,680
Even with all this shit floating around 
the elbow.

376
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,630
Let's just,
from years of Jujitsu of getting Armbar,

377
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:09,540
you're getting chunks of heartland 
snapped off,

378
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,940
you know,
that's like the dirty secret when it 

379
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:15,940
comes to,
uh,

380
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,430
whether it's grapplers or Stryker's.
A lot of these guys,

381
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,280
they get to the assert an age and 
they're just in pain and what are the.

382
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,940
Just fill in the pieces that were,
that came off.

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,040
They just break off.
There's nothing there anymore.

384
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,340
It's just more a mean.
Your cartilage gets damaged,

385
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,260
you know,
or whatever that is.

386
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:33,000
Bone Spurs,
whatever it is.

387
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,210
But it's a real good saga.
It's a common thing with a lot of guys.

388
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:43,281
A lot of guys get a elbow injuries and 
knee injuries for big chunks of a 

389
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,160
meniscus or removed from your legs.
This is a weird doesn't.

390
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,620
If it doesn't hurt,
don't worry about it,

391
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,430
man.
I'm telling you,

392
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,560
if it doesn't hurt,
it's just nonsense.

393
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,170
What if it's going to go into your 
bloodstream so they could die?

394
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,720
It could die.
They clog up your brain.

395
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:03,310
If it went through that you could die.
Let's go to [inaudible] dot com and use 

396
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,690
the cardboard Rogan.
Save 10 percent off any supplements.

397
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Still sponsor it must be.
We haven't never done the music on it,

398
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,870
so let's just do the music part.
No,

399
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,760
no.
All right.

400
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,950
Experience

401
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,260
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

402
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,560
Oh,
sweet baby.

403
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:33,561
Jesus already should fear fresh off of a
headlining Gig at the Tempe Improv you 

404
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,010
ideas.
It's pretty fun that that club is magic 

405
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,010
club.
Yeah.

406
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,890
They redid it a little bit.
Yeah.

407
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:44,700
In what way does on the sides.
It's moved out into the audience.

408
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,590
So they lose like some of the side 
seats.

409
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh yeah.
Uh,

410
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,370
basically looks the same.
The green room is downstairs now with 

411
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:52,370
the old manager's office.
Was,

412
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:52,740
was the old green room,
the green room.

413
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,380
They cut it in half and that's now a 
manager's office,

414
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,800
so there's extra seats up there.
Um,

415
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,120
and a full bar up there.
Oh really?

416
00:20:01,121 --> 00:20:02,220
Yeah.
Full working bar.

417
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,710
So you can like get up from your seat at
the bar.

418
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,850
Yeah.
Or the wages go up there.

419
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:08,280
I don't know if it's in player.
Not Interesting.

420
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,900
We didn't open the top.
Yeah,

421
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,570
that's cool that they did that man.
Joel's a bad motherfucker.

422
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,600
The guy who owns the Improv guy owns 
West Palm.

423
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,750
The guy who runs all those guys.
Yeah,

424
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,640
they do it.
Fucking fantastic job.

425
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,200
So cool.
Having clubs like that.

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,860
It was cool because it used to be a 
great club run by a maniac.

427
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,360
He got fired.
The old manager.

428
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,070
I mean they'll will own or got fired and
we're like,

429
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:32,640
what?
What do you mean?

430
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,240
How does the owner get fired?
They just doesn't sound right.

431
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,010
Like I wouldn't know.
Owner can't be around him anymore.

432
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,200
You crazy.
He was crazy.

433
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,400
He'd accuse people of like,
you still,

434
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,620
you still.
Champagne is like,

435
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:46,080
do we saw you walk out with champagne 
last night?

436
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,040
I don't remember that.
Well,

437
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,050
we all do.
I can't say that on the podcast because 

438
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,560
I don't know if it's true and he will 
sue the fuck out looking for anything.

439
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,970
Yeah.
Don't say his name.

440
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,570
Whatever.
He's like,

441
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,740
candy man.
Hey Dude.

442
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Gets fired from a situation like that.
They're probably not the healthiest 

443
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,400
mentally.
The only reason I knew his name was 

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,830
because he was a problem.
Well,

445
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,410
he was just any other manager,
owner.

446
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,640
It's like you don't even know who they 
are.

447
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,910
They just do their job.
The only reason I knew who he was in 

448
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,791
anybody's still talks about him,
it's because he was a problem without 

449
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:21,040
saying his name again.
One time,

450
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,380
one time we showed up at the Improv and 
we showed up like as the show started,

451
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,810
like I like to get there,
you know,

452
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,600
I mean I don't need to warm up and it's 
some big deal.

453
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:36,601
There's a video that plays,
like if the show starts at eight and 

454
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:36,820
we're there at 7:55,
who gives a shit,

455
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:38,580
we're not going to miss the show.
Don't worry.

456
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,190
Plus the has always liked to stay at the
condo right across the street instead of

457
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,180
the,
the Nice hotel.

458
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,980
But he was always there.
So yeah,

459
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,190
he was there already anyway.
Um,

460
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,350
so Ari and I got there and homeboy 
starts freaking out and says it already 

461
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,530
can't go on stage because he wasn't 
there early enough because we had to 

462
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:58,820
delay the cry on the phone as soon as I 
went in there,

463
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,950
like the phone call for you.

464
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,970
I'm like,
interesting.

465
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,100
I'm like,
oh,

466
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:02,860
hey man,
what's happening?

467
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,680
Yeah,
you can't let the widget,

468
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,330
the latest show for 20 minutes for you.
Like what are you talking about?

469
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,930
It's eight.
Oh,

470
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,090
three right now.
And this show is going on.

471
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,980
Yeah,
she fucking.

472
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,290
What are you talking about?
It's so crazy because people had to wait

473
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,480
outside in the rain too.
I was just in the rain smoking weed with

474
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,500
broken.
We knew it was fine there no rain out 

475
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,500
there.
What are you talking about?

476
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:22,870
He goes,
well,

477
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,580
you're not going on.
Oh,

478
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,570
I'm going on.
If there's one thing you're not going to

479
00:22:25,571 --> 00:22:27,700
tell me.
It's I'm not going off stage that night.

480
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,710
No fucking way.
Well,

481
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:31,120
he's also,
you know,

482
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,210
when,
when you're in that sort of situation,

483
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,950
like it's not like he's your employer.
He like,

484
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:41,310
it's like a private contractor now you 
told me that earlier in Boston when I 

485
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,310
was like,
oh,

486
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I shouldn't get high.

487
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:41,980
I'm going to go on stage.
And you're like,

488
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,490
who do you work at?
Is Four hundred 20 seat room on your own

489
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:50,930
for your comic.
So you're working for me and I don't 

490
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:50,930
mind.
So go for it,

491
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,850
like,
well I just,

492
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:56,500
my attitude was um,
whether it's you or anybody or Duncan or

493
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,530
you know,
any of the guys I took on the road with 

494
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:01,530
me.
It's like I already know.

495
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:01,530
You're funny.
Yeah.

496
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,310
Like it doesn't matter if you go up and 
eat shit.

497
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:04,630
I know we don't have to impress you.
Yeah.

498
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:06,610
You don't have to impress me.
He can't get fired.

499
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:11,690
Right.
Like all you have to do is just keep 

500
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:11,690
being you and we're golden.
So if you go up to high,

501
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,560
it'd be hilarious for all of us.
I was too.

502
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:18,100
I couldn't remember it.
My bits,

503
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,500
as long as you're willing to explain 
that to the audience,

504
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,350
it becomes unique experience.
I didn't know that.

505
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:27,130
Then I told them I couldn't think of a 
bit and I was like,

506
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,680
and I go,
hey joe Rogan's coming up soon.

507
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,160
And they all went crazy and I'm like,
why would I have said that?

508
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,900
That's being too high.
I'm not sure what to do.

509
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,680
Yeah.
But it makes it fun for me in the back.

510
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,350
It's fun for us out of it.
Well,

511
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,160
it's also,
you pulled

512
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,980
it out.
It's still a great show.

513
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:49,910
It was just really obvious that you were
high.

514
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,740
I'll tell you what though,
that second set,

515
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,050
that night I was going to real good 
buzz.

516
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,110
Yeah,
and that was a fun set because I can 

517
00:23:59,110 --> 00:23:59,110
remember my bits and also be free enough
to refer around.

518
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,470
Yeah,
I think that's the way to do it.

519
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:05,471
I think it's like he get real high and 
then you wait a long time and then you 

520
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:09,251
go on stage until told us over the hump,
but you're coming down when you can 

521
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,740
handle it like an hour and a half in 
when it's all smooth sailing.

522
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,310
You don't want.
Matt Edgar was doing for awhile.

523
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,680
What?
First hit of the day.

524
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,230
They'd be like when?
When the guy got the light before him,

525
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:19,220
let me see.
It's three minutes.

526
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,540
He'd go to the back and he'd be like,
all right,

527
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:21,140
let's start smoking.

528
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,880
And was just smoke a shit low until 
like,

529
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:23,360
all right,
that's it.

530
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,000
That's my time button because I run out 
and go right on.

531
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,430
It would hit him when he was on.
Wow,

532
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,550
that's crazy.
Yeah,

533
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,710
it's a bold move.
I think it's also a,

534
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,230
probably the most creative time,
like when you just wake up,

535
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:41,231
if you,
if you wake and bake and people think 

536
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,230
that waken baking is really like kantar 
counterproductive and you know,

537
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:47,231
waste your day,
you're not going to get never really 

538
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:48,230
done what I have done it like in bed.
No,

539
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:49,310
no,
no,

540
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:54,311
no.
I've done it like one of the first 

541
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:55,751
things in the morning and I've done it 
one on days where I have to do a lot of 

542
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:55,751
heavy writing.
Oh really?

543
00:24:55,751 --> 00:25:00,721
And I seem like it seems like everything
is really firing early in the morning 

544
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,270
when you've had a couple of hits.
Seems like creativity is enhanced by the

545
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,490
rest.
Like creativity is.

546
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:11,300
I'm wondering in general to.
Well a lot of times man and people don't

547
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:16,301
think about it that way because you 
think of morning is like when you have 

548
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:16,301
to go to work,

549
00:25:16,301 --> 00:25:16,350
right?
That's,

550
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,720
it's human nail is this,
you know what I'm talking about?

551
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,630
Human nail and I was just playing.
Come on.

552
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,530
How could that be possible?
Because someone else was in this box.

553
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,440
That's a human taste.
It.

554
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,820
Taste it.
It's on that box.

555
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,850
It's right on the box.

556
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,370
Hello?
Missing.

557
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,270
How could it be?
It's probably who.

558
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:49,170
Wait.
Who was here last?

559
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,830
Oh,
it's probably Duncan's Clinton.

560
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,780
Trump does nails.
If you imagine if you.

561
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,520
Do you want a podcast with someone who 
watched them,

562
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,650
trim them.
How's you're doing as you're doing it,

563
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,660
be like,
what the fuck are you doing with those 

564
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:03,660
gross thing?
It would be over somewhere in this area.

565
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,360
Scanning the rest of the table.
No,

566
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,330
I'm trying to find that one.
I'm hoping there's not a whole.

567
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:12,180
The US who smokes joints with random 
strangers.

568
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,560
Who knows what kinds of fucking weird 
fecal herpes you're passing around.

569
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,080
I put a toenail in my friends bond once 
and he hit it and it smells friend.

570
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,460
You're an enemy posing as a friend.

571
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,190
You're a terrible person.
It Burns.

572
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
Smelled like hair.
So what was the experience like going to

573
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,270
this club and doing it with just you and
Diaz?

574
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,860
It was pretty cool,
but ds has a very strict no comp policy,

575
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,470
so it was all just on fans,
which nice.

576
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,770
But we didn't get like tons of like 
those Asu chicks showing up wasn't as 

577
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:48,770
much of the party.
No.

578
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,360
So he has a no comms policy because you 
guys get a door deal.

579
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:52,590
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

580
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:54,180
And also he feels like,
and I agree a little bit,

581
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,180
which just cheapens the ticket saying 
you can get a ticket for free.

582
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:59,310
It makes it thing like you can get that 
right.

583
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,260
And he goes,
I don't want to see that.

584
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,660
It's a good point.
I tell the clubs in New York and La,

585
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:04,170
I'm like,
listen,

586
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:09,171
I'll retweet stuff when I'm on,
but I won't if it's saying half price 

587
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:09,171
tickets for free tickets to the Red 
River,

588
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:09,171
I'm like,
I can't retweet those.

589
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,090
You don't want to like keep saying this 
free shit of mine.

590
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,500
Well it's also the,
uh,

591
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,780
the audience,
their attitude about the show.

592
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:20,970
Oh yeah.
That's one thing that Joe is pretty 

593
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:20,970
adamant about shows where people are 
getting free tickets.

594
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,290
They're not going to treat it with 
respect.

595
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,010
That was the downfall of Miami.
The Miami probably tickets was.

596
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,050
That was.
That was drunk.

597
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:33,051
Cubans were always there.
That Miami Improv was the worst major 

598
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,120
players in the country.
It doesn't exist anymore.

599
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,340
It's gone.
Really gone.

600
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:40,320
I heard it's gone.
The the local comics.

601
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:44,700
It's like a little dance scene down 
there in Miami now in south Florida.

602
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:46,410
They have a little harm and turning that
gig down.

603
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,430
I got hard.
Yeah.

604
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,150
Do.
I'm like,

605
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,060
nope.
Nope,

606
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:54,061
nope.
That's when I stopped doing like way 

607
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:54,240
long ago.
More than 10 years ago.

608
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,400
I was just like,
there's no way I'm done.

609
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,680
This is a last.
I was saying it onstage.

610
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,020
This is the last time would come in 
here.

611
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,820
Like there's no doubt this is the 
dumbest club and wrong.

612
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,390
Everything is shitty part of town.
Well,

613
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:09,900
that's just the part of town was great.
The problem is they started,

614
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,080
they started giving away free tickets.
Remember there was all this cool 

615
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,480
restaurants and outdoor cafes.
Oh yeah.

616
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:16,920
Right there.
Yeah.

617
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,100
That comedy club was.
Yeah.

618
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,540
They had the place where you get those 
mixed drinks that the,

619
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:21,070
uh,
the,

620
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,290
the upfront.
Yep.

621
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,720
Yeah.
That wasn't bad.

622
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,820
No,
you go try to meet girls right across 

623
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:29,820
the way.
When they were,

624
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:29,820
they all poured out and went to that 
bar.

625
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,230
And then you were like a superstar.
Yeah,

626
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:32,310
I remember there.
Was that a cigar bar too?

627
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,160
They had like a cigar place.
You could sit down a little cigar lounge

628
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,370
and was ready to cry.

629
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,400
It was not,
it's not a bad little mall area.

630
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,710
The problem is that club had been 
cultivated in like the worst possible 

631
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:44,670
way.
Like the guy who was there before Joel,

632
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,770
there was all sorts of problems.
You'll manager try to quiet down at a 

633
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:49,770
table.
I'm like,

634
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,340
dude,
this fucking 30 tables screaming at each

635
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:50,780
other.
What,

636
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,710
what them.
Why are you picking them out?

637
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,940
Well,
they would try to stop a flood when it 

638
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:58,940
was already broken.
Yes.

639
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,580
Broken through.
You're putting their finger in to hold 

640
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,850
back the dam with their hands.
I've never been there.

641
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,650
I,
I brought up a boxer's name in a bit.

642
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,780
I forget what boxer,
but they started arguing over you.

643
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,160
No,
fuck him.

644
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,600
You know,
Oscar de la Hoya,

645
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:20,620
enough Chavez,
and they were fighting in the audience 

646
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,420
like who's the best boxer ever?
I'm like,

647
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,460
oh my God,
it'd be rude you guys,

648
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:24,470
but can you please be quiet?

649
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,730
Tables were yelling over at other 
tables.

650
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,620
They were like monkey.
They were like,

651
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,600
they were crazy.
There were the wildest audience I've 

652
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,370
ever seen.
I'd never seen an audience and I think,

653
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,720
you know,
you talked to them after the show,

654
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:39,270
like coming in because I was kind of 
curious about how this is possible.

655
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:42,250
That one club could be so bad,
so bad behaved,

656
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,860
and it was a lot of repeat customers.
A lot of people,

657
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,330
so they just knew that's how you're 
supposed to.

658
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,330
That's how it was there and that's just 
what they did.

659
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,030
That's just how it was there and that's 
what they did and so that's why they had

660
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:57,031
a tank.
The place they had cultivated and you 

661
00:29:57,031 --> 00:29:58,150
can't just let go the database because 
you let go of the database.

662
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:59,830
You have all the email addresses and 
everything.

663
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,110
All your customer.
You don't know what you're infected.

664
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,170
Exactly.
You don't know what the effective with 

665
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,320
samples.
That place was rough.

666
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,730
I saw,
I saw dsp put people underwater there.

667
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,850
Wouldn't that be one of the southern 
Florida ones were the ones that hired to

668
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:23,851
be a headliner killers.
That magnitude we needed to come down 

669
00:30:23,851 --> 00:30:24,400
here.
Dude.

670
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,960
I want,
I don't want to name names,

671
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,810
but Diaz did it to some people where 
they like quit comedy for awhile.

672
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,230
I name names.
I can't,

673
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,820
I can't because he's a nice guy,
but he had to go on after Diaz and I was

674
00:30:36,821 --> 00:30:37,870
like,
good God,

675
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:39,040
that,
that can't work.

676
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,800
That started.
I knew it wasn't going to work.

677
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,340
Ingram had somebody,
um,

678
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,840
that he was working with in Vegas and he
was kind of blowing them off the stage 

679
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,800
and the guy said like,
hey,

680
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:51,170
you're doing really well.
I'm having trouble following.

681
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,000
And I was like,
okay.

682
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,600
He goes,
oh,

683
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,340
I'm just telling you right now.
There's no way we're going to switch.

684
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:56,770
I'll just keep struggling following you 
because I'm not gonna.

685
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,260
I'm not gonna.
Switch switch.

686
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,120
Why didn't Ingram was switching?
No,

687
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,880
he didn't even say anything.
He was just like,

688
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:02,410
it goes,
okay.

689
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:05,890
I respect that to firearm.
It was just like,

690
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:06,610
you know,
I can't follow you.

691
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,220
Wow.
That's so be it.

692
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,040
We'll Ingram's got a different style 
because he works the crowd all the time.

693
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,760
Worked it.
Gets them riled up.

694
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,800
Yeah.
Working the crowd the way does a very 

695
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,520
different kind of performance.
It's very,

696
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,410
very fun.
Very funny.

697
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,970
You just have to know a couple of 
secrets that shit like certain people,

698
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:28,420
like you got to do a couple minutes,
crowd work to start two minutes,

699
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,770
then you can direct.
That's it.

700
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,000
Once you know that,
then you're fine.

701
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,330
Certain people,
it's just like there's certain ways to 

702
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,330
follow them.

703
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,330
Yeah.
Um,

704
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,330
there's,
there's that,

705
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,390
but they also,
you know,

706
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,650
there's other people that can kind of 
like set the pace and slow them down and

707
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,100
bring them into their world.
I've seen guys do that too.

708
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,810
Or the guy gets really riled and they 
just don't get rattled.

709
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:50,620
They just start from a neutral position 
and then work it back in and then,

710
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:55,680
you know,
20 minutes in or whatever they're 

711
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:55,680
killing.
They're doing it their way to be able to

712
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,341
pull the mic away from their face more 
so it's quieter so people can't hear 

713
00:31:59,341 --> 00:32:01,360
unless they quiet down themselves.
That's a good move to I guess.

714
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,490
But you got to have material to back 
that up.

715
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,430
You know?
It's like when you were going on after a

716
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:11,431
guy who does crowd work,
are you going after a guy who does 

717
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,910
music?
Anything that's like different than just

718
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,750
normal standup.
It sort of sets,

719
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:20,190
sets the tempo.
It's like going to see like captain 

720
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,401
America want to see Captain America and 
then you leave and it's an independent 

721
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:26,770
black and white film about a couple of 
dealing with the fact that you know,

722
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,210
childhood,
whatever,

723
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,890
you know.
You know what I'm saying?

724
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:34,420
I mean like how could you be in really 
intense movie intense emotional movie,

725
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,290
but if it filed captain America,
I feel like what the fuck is this?

726
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,130
What is this?
I can be very

727
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,760
hard to get your minds to see captain 
America has shitty wasn't it?

728
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,650
Wasn't shitty because I like those 
movies.

729
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,360
Oh,
he's such a goody two shoes.

730
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,670
I don't understand this.
In the first one,

731
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,310
the guy,
the first bad guy who steals a serum,

732
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,170
he's got some kid with a gun to his head
and cut.

733
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,250
All right.
All right.

734
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,410
All right.
Take it easy.

735
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,370
Don't do anything.
Rash.

736
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,660
And the guy's like,
cool.

737
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,800
And then he just throws the.
He just throws the kid and then runs,

738
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,250
but he's still the kid in the water than
Captain America would have to save them 

739
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:09,350
or kill that kid.
Take them with you.

740
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,010
Those are both excellent points.
Don't.

741
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,460
No other army said like,
well,

742
00:33:13,461 --> 00:33:15,380
let's just get a kid.
Here's the best point.

743
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,100
All Captain America's battles against 
evil.

744
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:24,150
Yeah.
Are silly because he's friends with the 

745
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,441
hulk and he's evil.
The hulk is the bucket and ultimate bad 

746
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:26,441
motherfucker know.

747
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:28,460
Why wouldn't you just call the whole cup
spider,

748
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,130
right?
But they're in the avengers together.

749
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:32,450
Okay,
so if they're in the avengers,

750
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:37,500
oh exists.
So he's having these fucking knocked 

751
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:37,500
down.
Drag out,

752
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,750
fight to this guy and to go back and 
forth and back and forth,

753
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,470
and somebody called the,
called the like,

754
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,340
yeah,
everything's done.

755
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,070
And he's jumping into the sky and 
pulling.

756
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:47,930
Shout at sky.
That is a problem with the avengers.

757
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,540
Number one problem.
He's unbeatable.

758
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:55,541
So now you have this.
So the only thing you're waiting for it 

759
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:55,541
to him to show that he's unbeatable.
Exactly.

760
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:58,430
It's waiting for the hug to just get mad
and start fucking everything up.

761
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,950
Like he doesn't even.
He doesn't.

762
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,160
He doesn't even put on an outfit.
Everybody else is wearing their outfit.

763
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,200
He's walking around with a fucking suit 
and tie.

764
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,250
It's like,
look,

765
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,200
when the shit goes down,
I'm ready for you all.

766
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,880
You pussies.
I got your back.

767
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,060
I'm not even going to wear like a suit 
and pretend I'm going to turn into the 

768
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,301
hulk.
Like he's the fucking avengers knows 

769
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:19,580
that he's out there,
that he's going to have to turn into the

770
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:21,740
hulk and he still doesn't even put on a 
suit.

771
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:22,730
Yeah.
That's like if you have a friend who's a

772
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:27,731
contractor and you're building a fucking
extension or health or would you not 

773
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:31,061
call it?
What kind of Yoga Pants is that 

774
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:31,061
motherfucker wearing?
He.

775
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:34,571
They work on him when he is five foot 10
to 170 pounds and they also work on him 

776
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,870
when he is seven feet,
five,

777
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,960
250,000
pounds or whatever the hell.

778
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:43,200
The hulk ways.
I mean,

779
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,150
how is it possible that the same pants 
work on both dudes?

780
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,020
I would say that in the early years that
was more problematic,

781
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,030
but once it becomes part of the avengers
that they would have had the technology 

782
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,151
to work,
why wouldn't they fucking get him an 

783
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,640
outfit that he could change into and be 
comfortable wearing this tiny man's 

784
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:00,640
pants?

785
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,250
Like they don't make any sense.
You're wearing a dress.

786
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:07,460
Let's see the hog transformation.
Let's pull up the whole transformation.

787
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:11,540
Let's break down how ridiculous this is 
because if you look at the difference in

788
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:16,541
size,
you're dealing with a person that's 

789
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:18,791
like,
I would love to see a scale models next 

790
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:18,791
to each other to see how those pants 
could take.

791
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,060
How many times bigger as he.
Is it 10?

792
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,850
Like is he like 10 times bigger?
No.

793
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,720
He could fit in this room,
right?

794
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,050
No.
Couldn't even fit in this room no bigger

795
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:27,750
than a house.
Yeah.

796
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,860
He's way bigger than this room.
He'd be size of like a tank.

797
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,260
Do you ever see.
Do you ever see when he grabs the,

798
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,000
the,
the Loci Loci?

799
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,800
Yeah.
Dude Loki is like a six dude.

800
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:37,990
Like a

801
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,060
six foot tall,
six foot tall dude.

802
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh,
this is the wrong one.

803
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,600
This is all of them.
Oh,

804
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:44,190
this is all of them.
Oh,

805
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:45,270
those.
The original watch.

806
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:50,271
See the original one on television.
Which Lou Ferrigno saying that guy 

807
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:51,990
would've been like size of more than a 
house.

808
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,950
Right up to his knee.
The Lou Ferrigno is a giant guy.

809
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,600
Right?
But he was a human.

810
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,300
Like when you see in Lou Ferrigno here,
do all this stuff.

811
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,000
It's kind of hilarious.
It's awesome.

812
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,890
You know,
he's obviously huge.

813
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,990
He's a giant guy through that bag of 
fucking coconuts at that there,

814
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,060
but there's a giant difference,
which.

815
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,490
Okay,
wait,

816
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,200
so now he's okay.
But he's the same size tank.

817
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,860
You should burst through tax breaks.

818
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,660
Yeah,
there'd be no room for the displacement 

819
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:23,660
of water.
Right.

820
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,500
Would change radically overnight.
But look at the size of them.

821
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,470
Look how much bigger that is.
And his fucking pants still fit.

822
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,070
Oh yeah.
Now here's the Edward Norton did it?

823
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,520
Yeah.
You didn't know Ed Norton was the hug 

824
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,520
was one of the better.
I liked him.

825
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,240
Apparently he didn't like it.
He didn't want to do it.

826
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,320
He's an actor,
but he's a really good actor.

827
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:48,321
I think he was worried about getting 
lumped into this thing and becoming the 

828
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:48,321
hulk,
you know,

829
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,470
but he was a good hall.
So Cgi afterwards.

830
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,780
Good acting there.
Aerosmith's daughter,

831
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,010
Erin start as a good actress.
She wasn't going to do this.

832
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,890
No one even there.
She should have said something already.

833
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,990
She's doing that.
This is the best though.

834
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,050
Mark refollow.
Yeah,

835
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,590
he's called.
I'm always angry.

836
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:16,730
I mean,
come on,

837
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:18,350
man,
this is a giant space shit,

838
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,500
but he's a size of like two cars.
No,

839
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,320
no.
You got to see him.

840
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,240
You got to see better.
Better images of him.

841
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,080
He's bigger than two cars.
He's gigantic.

842
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,090
It wasn't one of them where he got 
bigger.

843
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:31,580
If you got angrier,
I would get double angry.

844
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Yeah,
he would get bigger if we get more 

845
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:36,640
angry.
You get even bigger.

846
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,390
Is there any metaphor with green with 
envy with him or not?

847
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,400
It just happened to be green.
Just I think it was a gamma ray thing 

848
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,350
because the whole idea was that he was 
created in an accident with gamma rays.

849
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,470
Did you know that?
His name was Bruce Banner and the comic 

850
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,021
books,
but they didn't want to have it on tv 

851
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,881
because the gay connotations,
so when they changed the TV to David 

852
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,810
David Banner.
Wow.

853
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,490
His name is Bruce Banner.
You're right.

854
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,700
Yeah,
I am right.

855
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,440
This is a fact.
What was in the avengers?

856
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Oh,
I don't know a better be bruce banner 

857
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and the better assholes because they to 
reduce TV show.

858
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,210
His name is God Damn Bruce.
There's nothing wrong with Bruce Lee.

859
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,230
Bruce become the gay name.
How could it be when Bruce Lee is one of

860
00:38:12,231 --> 00:38:14,450
the baddest motherfuckers the world has 
ever known?

861
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,110
How good bruce,
you know,

862
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,690
be in some way thought of as a non 
favorite springsteen.

863
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,320
He sang it like Bruce.
Yeah.

864
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,470
It's the easiest that became the gay 
name.

865
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,990
It's so weird.
Well,

866
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,620
how did that happen?
Oh,

867
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,950
it's very strange.
And why do one ear become the gate here?

868
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,070
Was that there sign a good question 
because

869
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,590
I'm new thing.
Was that a real thing?

870
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,390
I had it in my left ear because I didn't
want to be thought of as a gay person.

871
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,120
Bruce Lee's going to be on the news.
Is going to be a character in the UFC.

872
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,330
Yeah.
It'd be able to unlock them.

873
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,410
Who sold that?
Right?

874
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't know.
Probably Shan.

875
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,020
Uh,
his daughter.

876
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,640
Yeah.
Um,

877
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,120
but uh,
yeah man,

878
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I had bruce banner was his real name.
Sharon.

879
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,780
Sharon.
Sharon.

880
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:13,410
Um,
I had a group of 10 people at the table 

881
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:13,840
and Buffalo,
like table on fire.

882
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:19,220
Oh,
they had those candle things and I saw 

883
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,220
the.
Yeah,

884
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:19,220
accidentally,
like they put like the just put a Napkin

885
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,830
over it and sort of like caught and I 
saw them,

886
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:24,670
I'll look at it and then like through 
some napkins,

887
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,300
but they're all just like panicking,
like they didn't know what to do when 

888
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,300
there.

889
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,300
I just watched the Napkins all catch.
Oh my God,

890
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,200
why did they throw a drink on it?
Because they panicked,

891
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,270
like see them all just like their hands 
were up.

892
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,570
You know what that is man.
Peoples' for girls' working every day 

893
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,930
and not having to deal with real life,
real life,

894
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,200
but these were pretty 21 year old.
That's the problem.

895
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,040
They should be out there camping every 
day fishing for their food,

896
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:53,610
fucking pulling roots out and then they 
would see a crisis in act and they're 

897
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:53,620
like,
oh cool.

898
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,630
It absolutely alive instead of this 
fucking weird shadow existence.

899
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:01,920
We live in graduating college,
getting jobs.

900
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,250
You see that fight that was in Houston 
at the chicken place.

901
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,990
Throw that up.
I love those fights.

902
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:14,070
Hip Hop real made.
It creates more of this.

903
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,010
Of course it does.
People Worldstar well,

904
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:20,440
the fights are going on that you always 
kept buffering on roadster.

905
00:40:20,441 --> 00:40:25,441
Like all the videos are always 
constantly buffering fucking amount of 

906
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:26,260
web traffic they must get.
It's got to be insane.

907
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,050
Where'd they still the computers from?
It shot up,

908
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,790
Brian.
It's probably a white people.

909
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,840
It's probably relatively

910
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,560
gold star.
I can save money.

911
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,490
This is a restaurant managers trying to 
kick this woman out.

912
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,020
Can't see anything.
Houston.

913
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,350
First of all,
I was shocked the way the black.

914
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,630
This guy.
It's a guy or a girl.

915
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,610
Oh God.
You to guy grabbing her.

916
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,880
Tried to pull her away.
You can't do that.

917
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,920
Oh,
now it's a full brawl.

918
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,560
They're all going at it with.
We're pulling fat.

919
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:14,410
Look at it.
He's got that girl on site control on 

920
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:14,410
the ground.
Yeah.

921
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,580
It's like judo baby.
All my fighting while holding a baby.

922
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,770
Oh my gosh.
She is fighting while holding her baby.

923
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:28,140
The baby wasn't even backing up.
She was going into this is saying,

924
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,580
you can't do this to get your baby out 
of here.

925
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,630
And she's like,
don't touch me.

926
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,560
And look,
he's got her by the week.

927
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,090
She's got her by the we've.
No,

928
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,390
that's a guy.
That's a guy.

929
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,830
David Lloyd that employs a guy right 
there.

930
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,750
Oh girl.
Got a better.

931
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,900
So they were all holding.
I don't think that's a weeds or hair 

932
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:51,900
that's right here.
That's why it's so effective.

933
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,910
And when it gets a nappy weaves.
So what was this?

934
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,960
I didn't even get that order.
Well,

935
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:59,800
I heard two stories.
One inch.

936
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,910
One this a woman wanted a refund and 
then that's what the restaurant is 

937
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:09,030
saying is that the woman tried to take a
beer out off the property and you're not

938
00:42:09,031 --> 00:42:12,300
allowed to take a beer outside.
You could only drink the beer inside the

939
00:42:12,301 --> 00:42:15,660
place because it's illegal.
So that manager just went crazy.

940
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,850
They fired the manager up at this 
restaurant.

941
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,880
I guess they're a supposedly like people
are picketing this restaurant and we 

942
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,711
went to that whole topic too in Houston 
and they always had that armed security 

943
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:27,711
guard.
That's when you know,

944
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,680
you've getting some like yeah,
that's real Mexican food that the guy,

945
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,410
well it's just Houston.
Three in the morning gets kind of crazy.

946
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,950
Yeah.
That was a great restaurant though,

947
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,920
was still have the best Jalapeno poppers
I've ever had in my life.

948
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:46,030
They were legit Jalapeno poppers.
It was the whole Mexican food 

949
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,030
experience.
There was legit.

950
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,350
They had Mariachi bands that were 
playing

951
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,660
by the bar.
If I was still.

952
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,790
I got drunk.
I had to go to the bathroom real quick 

953
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,790
and Barf.
Do you remember that Brian?

954
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,790
Yup.
You're like,

955
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,250
where did you just go?
Brian knew I was like,

956
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:56,970
what?
No big deal.

957
00:42:56,971 --> 00:42:58,990
I did it fast though.
I thought I had it clear.

958
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,520
They had good Mariachi bands like you 
would actually enjoy the really.

959
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,020
They were good.
They were talented.

960
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,380
So you'd be there eating and these guys 
said,

961
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:08,080
uh,
and you know,

962
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,480
sometimes girls sometimes they never 
check play too.

963
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,350
Wow.
Yeah,

964
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:14,800
they were really good man of food.
There was fucking bad ass too.

965
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,250
And after you have like,
like sometimes you know,

966
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,250
two shows Friday,
two shows Saturday let's go.

967
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:24,820
Fucking eat.
Slammed down some Mexican food,

968
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,870
2:00
in the morning,

969
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:28,630
hot after shows.
Massive peppers.

970
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:29,140
Yeah.

971
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,950
Full of.
Not even the cream cheese garbage.

972
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:31,450
Like,
Hey,

973
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,850
it's full of like cheese,
cheese,

974
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,760
cheddar cheese or something and it had 
it had meat inside that.

975
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,370
What?
Brian,

976
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,040
when you were at San Jose and we were at
this restaurant and they're like,

977
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,820
Joe had to take this plate of food and 
it had like a side of like,

978
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:51,040
I think it was a crawfish or something 
like that,

979
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,580
bit the head off of it or I forget what 
you did,

980
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,230
like you did the wrong end or something 
like that.

981
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,070
We're just like,
oh no,

982
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,120
that's not.
I don't remember this at all.

983
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,710
I sort of remember that.
I think it was San Jose at Mccormack was

984
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:06,920
like,
that's not the end.

985
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,430
It's supposed to eat.
It was like a garden.

986
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,850
There was a little baby ones or 
something and they weren't prepared the 

987
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:17,851
same way.
You just got like a mouthful of brain 

988
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:18,130
and I had a delicious.
Have you ever had that?

989
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:20,440
Like shrimp heads have done this?
Wasn't that?

990
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:22,030
I remember that.
I remember that.

991
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,570
Like I think you're supposed to eat it 
like,

992
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,240
nope,
nope,

993
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,380
nope.
You're not sure.

994
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,340
In other countries it's probably a 
delicacy.

995
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,360
Weird.
When you find out what,

996
00:44:31,361 --> 00:44:31,980
what people

997
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,060
eat in other countries,
like,

998
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:35,870
um,
my friend Ed God was telling me that uh,

999
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:40,910
uh,
a store opened up down the street from 

1000
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:41,640
them and that they serve camel.
Really?

1001
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:42,990
Yeah.
They sell it.

1002
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,220
They sit a meat store and wasn't a 
country America.

1003
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,430
Fucking silver lake.
Oh,

1004
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:48,450
I did that.
Yeah.

1005
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,680
And uh,
they,

1006
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:54,681
they serve camel sell.
They don't serve because they don't 

1007
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:57,171
cook.
It's a butcher shop and they sell camel 

1008
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:57,171
meat.
You're like,

1009
00:44:57,171 --> 00:44:57,171
I can't do this.
Can't be.

1010
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,060
I can't prepare the camera.
Well,

1011
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:00,210
this,
if they sell it,

1012
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,300
there must be restaurants in La.
That service.

1013
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,780
There must be,
it must be.

1014
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,060
It's pretty common in the Arab world.
Camel,

1015
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:07,160
camel,
camel.

1016
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,920
I don't care for.
Dane had an episode of his show where he

1017
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:13,770
was in Egypt and they slaughtered a 
camel.

1018
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:14,910
Like,
see if you can pull that up.

1019
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,790
Anthony Bordain in Egypt with a camel.

1020
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,040
You wouldn't need that.
You say,

1021
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,580
Oh fuck that.
Why?

1022
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,920
What's wrong with this shit is goat 
head.

1023
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,480
That's delicate.
Like a lot of people.

1024
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,540
It's a real heavy eyes.
Eat the brain.

1025
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,370
That stomach.
I've never had godhead head,

1026
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:33,690
but I ate a deer head when we were in 
Wisconsin and Montana.

1027
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,380
We cook deer head cook,
especially mule deer.

1028
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,140
They have a meal.
You killed them.

1029
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,230
You'll know it's called a mule deer.
It's just the name of it.

1030
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,180
It's dear.
Oh,

1031
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,640
but when you,
um,

1032
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,010
like,
like a,

1033
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,070
like a monkey mind is also referred to 
as a dolphin fish.

1034
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,670
A lot of people think it's a dolphin.
Like you're killing dolphins.

1035
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,260
No,
they call them dolphins.

1036
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:58,410
It's actually a Mahi Mahi.
I'm not against Culligan Mule,

1037
00:45:58,411 --> 00:46:01,500
but it just seemed like something that 
wouldn't be a hard one.

1038
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,300
No,
I wouldn't be the hardest one to kill,

1039
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:03,540
right?

1040
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:08,830
Yeah.
I by a sheep kill Jay Hahn ranch on the 

1041
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:08,830
way to San Jose.
Oh yeah,

1042
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:08,960
yeah,
yeah,

1043
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,560
man,
it's so big.

1044
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:12,120
It's 2 million,
700,000

1045
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:12,800
acres.
I mean you're like,

1046
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,820
oh,
there's that ranch and then like 20 

1047
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:17,820
minutes.
And then you're like,

1048
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:17,820
what?
We're still passing that ranch.

1049
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,800
Yeah.
It's the biggest ranch in all of 

1050
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:21,800
California.
Wow.

1051
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:21,800
This giant.
And we're going there and we're going to

1052
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,140
shoot some pigs.
Yeah,

1053
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,590
dude,
we're going to schedule that soon.

1054
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,300
It's fucking fun.
I'm leaving.

1055
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,800
I'm going back to New York soon.
Son.

1056
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:31,530
Why would you do that?
Just because it's warm there in April.

1057
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,420
He's a smart fella.
You're doing what a lot of old people do

1058
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:37,080
in Florida.
I guess so.

1059
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,960
Yeah.
I think that's such a great move.

1060
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:45,140
Isn't it nice to have the financial 
freedom to just travel around and do 

1061
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,140
whatever you want?
Yeah,

1062
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,600
Bro.
It's the fucking nice civic.

1063
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,950
Still got the bulletproof stuff that 
soon.

1064
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,970
That thing will never die.
Ever even had a problem with that car.

1065
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,230
No.
Those things are.

1066
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,900
God Damn.
I've never had their masterpieces.

1067
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,360
I mean it's still got like manual 
windows and stuff.

1068
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,100
So what?
Manual transmission too,

1069
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:05,490
right?
Yeah,

1070
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,360
man,
I don't care about that but the thing is

1071
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,520
it's got a CD player do it for a lot of 
people.

1072
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,160
Manual transmissions,
a deal breaker,

1073
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,350
stuck in traffic,
having to use the clutch.

1074
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:13,950
I,
nevermind that.

1075
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:17,910
It's only hard when you're trying to 
like repack a bowl or something.

1076
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,030
Text.
When I drive,

1077
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,120
if I drive like a and I know I'm going 
to be on the four or five,

1078
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:29,121
I never take the porsche just because 
the manual transmission that's going to 

1079
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:29,121
stop.
Yeah.

1080
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:30,480
Yeah.
And my manual transmission

1081
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,150
is a tricky one to drive because it has 
what's called a single mass flywheel,

1082
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,250
which means the ribs.
It's like a race car.

1083
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:39,760
The rose gold and they drop really quick
too,

1084
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,120
so they rise up and then they fall 
really quick too because of the fly 

1085
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:45,120
wheel.
So,

1086
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,760
um,
that makes it harder for speed.

1087
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,240
The ability to shift gears,
just it's a lighter flywheel but because

1088
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,780
it's all about saving weight and cars 
like that.

1089
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,080
But when you're at a red light it's a 
real problem because he wants to drop 

1090
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,321
off real quick.
So you have to be really much more 

1091
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:07,321
careful with it.
Yeah,

1092
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,040
you'll stall out A.
Yeah.

1093
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,530
Hills are bad too.
And you've got to fall back into people.

1094
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,620
Yeah,
like that last one hill and it hits 

1095
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:16,620
sunset.
I've cooked many a clutch on that hill.

1096
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,530
Oh God.
I'm always like,

1097
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,420
take.
I'm like back back.

1098
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,310
Stop it.
Well,

1099
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:21,850
you worked the e-brake too,
right?

1100
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,900
Yeah.
That's a real big fuck up that Porsche 

1101
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:26,900
did.
Portia,

1102
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,320
did they have a button e-brake now?
Like you dummies that's needed.

1103
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:34,330
That mistake that the manipulating the 
brake with your hand was everything 

1104
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:34,870
that's on hills when you're parking is 
supposed to pick that.

1105
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,410
Put that on.
Now they just have a button electronic.

1106
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:42,580
Right.
But the modular might be able to 

1107
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:42,580
modulate it,
you know,

1108
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:44,560
being able to like pull a little bit and
then let go as you started.

1109
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:50,490
I love doing that.
I had before that I had an old Toyota 

1110
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:51,910
and it was automatic and I will go up 
the hill on sweetzer and when I'm at the

1111
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:55,090
light I let go of the brake and put the 
accelerator and it was just stand still.

1112
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,620
We just couldn't go.
Wow.

1113
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,210
It was just,
it didn't have the power and I feel like

1114
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,010
jettison shit or just turn around.

1115
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,030
My car has to fly wheels or something 
like that.

1116
00:49:04,031 --> 00:49:07,470
So like if it's on a hill it just 
automatically kicks in the other fly.

1117
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,940
So then when you let go of the brake it 
doesn't move.

1118
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,070
And then you just hit the gas and just 
go straight up.

1119
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:17,130
That's interesting.
That doesn't make sense though because 

1120
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:17,130
it's an automatic.
You don't have an automatic.

1121
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,580
So it's whatever it is you're talking 
about.

1122
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:23,581
It's probably a different mechanism.
Probably something to do with the 

1123
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:23,581
transmission.
It's probably a dual clutch transmission

1124
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:23,950
clutch.
That's what it is.

1125
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,340
Yeah.
The,

1126
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:28,710
a lot of the modern automatic cars or 
dual clutch now,

1127
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,480
which that means is also that,
um,

1128
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,610
the shift gears and insane amounts of 
time real,

1129
00:49:33,611 --> 00:49:34,480
real fast.
Yeah.

1130
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,290
Like,
like in the Porsche's,

1131
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,400
like the gt three,
I think it does it in like less than 100

1132
00:49:39,401 --> 00:49:40,500
milliseconds.
What?

1133
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:46,060
They didn't change it manually.

1134
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,750
Yeah.
Oh,

1135
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,410
way faster than they think that every 
shift of gear,

1136
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,440
like in a race is worth three quarters 
of a car shift between a manual gearbox 

1137
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,600
and uh,
these double clutch boxes,

1138
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,560
meaning that if they're both going along
the same speed in the same pace,

1139
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,740
but one had to shift gears,
the one that didn't have to take any 

1140
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,550
time to shift the gears would get a 
three quarter car length advantage.

1141
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,700
Wow.
Yeah.

1142
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,250
So yeah.
No over shift.

1143
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,380
Oh,
oh,

1144
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:15,830
per shift.
Well,

1145
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:20,290
yeah,
because if you don't have to,

1146
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:22,660
there's no the off.
None of that.

1147
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,600
It's instantaneous.
It's fun driving a stick shift.

1148
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,830
It is.
That's the problem.

1149
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,070
The problem is like what

1150
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,800
do you do in trying to race everywhere 
on those hills?

1151
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:33,590
Up in the mountains though when you were
like going uphill for like five miles,

1152
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,770
you just lowered the fucking,
you know,

1153
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,030
gear you're in pickup.
Yeah.

1154
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,090
I don't mind it at all.
Especially the Porsche.

1155
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:43,440
That thing is a ride.
Like you can't do that.

1156
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,740
No,
it doesn't feel as good.

1157
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,290
Like I have an automatic.
My bmws and automatic.

1158
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,310
It's,
but it's a double clutch.

1159
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:54,311
Automatic.
Like you can do it with a paddle shifts 

1160
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:54,311
if you want,
but most of the time I don't.

1161
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:56,930
I just drive it.
The problem is that's an old style thing

1162
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:01,931
that somehow sometimes more fun.
My aunt got this car and she got 

1163
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:02,030
automatics.
I'm like lexus or something,

1164
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:04,430
but it had instead of a clock to being 
digital,

1165
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:06,710
it was analog.
It was like,

1166
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,960
what are you doing?
It's just going to take the extra time.

1167
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,960
That's a fancy car,
but you're going to get your eyes off 

1168
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,810
the road for longer.
I just trying to decipher that.

1169
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,060
It's true.
Like this is a bad idea.

1170
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,580
It's terrible idea.
Digital Id.

1171
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,110
Digital clocks never became classy 
though.

1172
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,460
Never became closing.
No.

1173
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,480
You know what I mean?
Think about all these like really super 

1174
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:27,650
expensive watches that everybody wears 
number digital analog for awhile.

1175
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:33,010
Digital.
It was just like it was a picture of 

1176
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,010
the.
The hands moving.

1177
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:33,010
Oh,
those are crappy watches.

1178
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,190
You don't remember that Brian.
I have this online to those new Samsung 

1179
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,141
watches and like the Iwatch type shit.
They have like the fake front where you 

1180
00:51:41,141 --> 00:51:42,560
could just download new faces here.
Oh really?

1181
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:47,950
So it looked like whatever you want to 
actually kind of cool though because 

1182
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:50,381
it's cool.
It's almost like a little computer in 

1183
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:50,420
there.
I'm attempted to get that Samsung one,

1184
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,720
which was the new one.

1185
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:54,430
New One.
Phone monitors your heart rate watch.

1186
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,730
They also have a small one where it's 
just like a kind of looks like the fit 

1187
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:04,331
band,
like a thinner one that also does like 

1188
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:07,270
the heart rate and stuff like that.
Doesn't have a camera on then what you 

1189
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,270
call yourself after your workout.
Fitband,

1190
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,170
you know they have a new galaxy s five.
It's out now that has a heart rate 

1191
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,120
monitor on it.
On the phone.

1192
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:14,840
The phone.
What?

1193
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,400
What did you just put it at a wrist?
No,

1194
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:19,130
you touch it and hold onto it and it 
monitors your heart rate.

1195
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,020
Interesting.
So I could never use it.

1196
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:23,600
I use it at the gym over in between 
workouts.

1197
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:28,601
Like say if you do like do some,
some fucking crazy kettlebell workout 

1198
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:32,680
and then you grabbed this thing when 
your heart drops to a certain rate and 

1199
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:32,680
then you go again.

1200
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:32,680
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1201
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:37,241
And it works with fit software.
They have software that's built in to 

1202
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,430
sure how drunk you are.
Yeah,

1203
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,130
I had that.
I have that,

1204
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:44,810
uh,
that galaxy note three.

1205
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:49,310
I'm a huge fan of these things go really
well or it might be done with it.

1206
00:52:49,311 --> 00:52:52,070
I'm a huge fan of that.
Look how big that is.

1207
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,040
That's fucking awesome.
14th.

1208
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,600
June 14th.
June 14th.

1209
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:57,990
What's that?
When they release date,

1210
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,370
big iphones,
the big iphones sizes,

1211
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:06,430
allegedly behind the fucking curb.
Those freaks since fucking what's his 

1212
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:12,230
name went down since jobs since jobs 
into their fucked up,

1213
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:14,060
left and right.
Mistakes.

1214
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,660
Look how big that Goddamn picture of us.
Look at that picture.

1215
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,770
That's sorry.
Before I shaved my head,

1216
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,750
you look awesome.
But look,

1217
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,770
I mean that's a huge.
It's very perfect crystal clear image.

1218
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,040
It's just so

1219
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:26,940
good.
I'm just,

1220
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:31,941
uh,
I just can't believe that it took them 

1221
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:33,981
long enough to realize that that fits 
easily in your back pocket and the 

1222
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,970
experience of going online.
The experience of looking at pictures,

1223
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,971
the experience of taking pictures,
the experience of reading tweets and 

1224
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:41,580
then going to websites like someone 
sends you a website,

1225
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,850
it's infinitely better.
Like you could actually go to a website 

1226
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,850
and get a good web experience from one 
of the brilliant things or it doesn't 

1227
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:50,490
even have to be that big.
Like the galaxy.

1228
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,670
It's five point one inches.
This is like five point nine or 

1229
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,190
something like that.
The galaxy is five point one.

1230
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:56,940
And

1231
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:58,520
how much is this?
The new one?

1232
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,110
I think they're all pretty.
Pretty similar points.

1233
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,740
I'll buy that new iphone.
No,

1234
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,000
the old one.
How much?

1235
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:06,740
How big.
Oh,

1236
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,390
it's tiny.
It's four inches.

1237
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,420
I used to do fucking stuff on the old 
envy.

1238
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:15,310
Try to surf websites over that.
Difficult before they even had.

1239
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,170
It was the one that popped up and you 
had a little keyboard.

1240
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:22,160
Isn't it crazy that that seems like a 
100 million years ago.

1241
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,740
There were no mobile sites still,
but you could get on their sites,

1242
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,400
but how much

1243
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:29,360
different have some inventions been in 
that time?

1244
00:54:29,361 --> 00:54:32,240
Like how much?
Like cars are pretty much recognizable.

1245
00:54:32,241 --> 00:54:34,150
Exactly the same back then.
Almost exactly the same.

1246
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:39,151
Yeah.
Not that much difference until I breaks 

1247
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,961
with a before.
Like they look a little slicker on the 

1248
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:40,961
outside.
Like the new Mercedes is like.

1249
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,180
Yeah.
But other than that you recognize it.

1250
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:47,720
If you could go back in time 10 years 
and get into a car,

1251
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:48,530
you'd be fine.

1252
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,680
No,
I didn't even have a phone 10 years ago.

1253
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,120
Hey,
cell phone?

1254
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,040
No,
I was late anyway.

1255
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:54,910
Really?
Yeah.

1256
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:57,580
And we're in 2004.
He didn't have one.

1257
00:54:57,581 --> 00:54:58,330
Get out of here,
bitch.

1258
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,020
You're crazy.
No one ever lived in that place.

1259
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:03,760
I didn't have one for a while.
When did you get one?

1260
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:06,610
What year?
Two thousand five.

1261
00:55:06,611 --> 00:55:08,470
Two thousand six when we go on the road 
together,

1262
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,170
but not always like God will eventually.
I found one.

1263
00:55:11,171 --> 00:55:16,171
I found a prepaid one in New York one 
time when I was visiting and so I used 

1264
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:17,950
that for awhile.
I sat by it for about an hour waiting to

1265
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,540
see if somebody comes back,
I'll claim it.

1266
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,220
Otherwise you don't have to use a phone 
for the whole week.

1267
00:55:22,221 --> 00:55:22,750
And I was like,
Oh,

1268
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,790
this is actually nice.
It's better than a pager.

1269
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,300
It's way better than a page or dude,
it was 2004 really old Nokia with snake 

1270
00:55:32,321 --> 00:55:35,650
and that snake snake was good.
Dude.

1271
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:38,740
I had a star Tac.
Remember those are tech.

1272
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,090
What is that?
Remember those?

1273
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,170
Was it a Mitsubishi who?
Motorola.

1274
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,260
Motorola.
STARTAC still still use a flip phone.

1275
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,760
Does he?
Of course he does.

1276
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,120
He has an iphone too,
but he doesn't use that as much.

1277
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,520
He enjoys being an old man.
Yeah.

1278
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,500
I had one of these.
Let's see,

1279
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:59,330
image that looks like or people who 
worked.

1280
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:00,430
Yeah.

1281
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,400
I have one of those and it had an extra 
battery,

1282
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,750
like the battery,
like stuck,

1283
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:06,900
stuck out on the top.
You'll see.

1284
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,590
Look how easy the batteries were to get 
off.

1285
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Oh yeah.
You were pissed about that when the 

1286
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:13,680
iphones came out and like,
come on man.

1287
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Give you the option.
Yeah,

1288
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,320
stupid.
Well that's the other thing I like about

1289
00:56:14,321 --> 00:56:15,370
this phone.
The Samsung,

1290
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:20,670
I have an extra battery that I keep with
me that it's fully charged and this 

1291
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:23,761
fucking thing.
We'll go for a day and a half and any 

1292
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:23,980
point in time I popped the off,
put the new

1293
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,880
battery.
Boom.

1294
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,030
It's fully charged.
Really?

1295
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,930
What does that the note.
But guess the notes.

1296
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,230
Three notes through.
Yeah.

1297
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:34,470
And on top of that man,
I sound like I'm in a no commercial and 

1298
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:34,880
then having a note for.
Well,

1299
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,790
they're going to work on right now.
Just know.

1300
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:38,260
Yeah,
this,

1301
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,480
this one's fairly recent,
but the,

1302
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:45,481
um,
the other thing that's super cool is 

1303
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:45,940
this,
my ideas,

1304
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:49,380
my joke ideas.
I actually write them like,

1305
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,400
look at this.
Whoa.

1306
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,880
It's all a notepad.
So all of my ideas,

1307
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:58,750
I actually write down like I don't need 
to carry a notebook anymore.

1308
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:03,990
Like my notebook now.
Like my actual physical handwriting 

1309
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,000
hurted so bad.
What's that?

1310
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,670
Her Tattoo is so bad.
Frosty asked me that and he goes,

1311
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:09,730
what did you just write down?
I'm like,

1312
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:10,470
no.
He goes,

1313
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,140
what was it?
He goes,

1314
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,760
it's not a joke.
It's just almond shaped nipples to write

1315
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:17,080
that down because I might get back to 
it.

1316
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:18,490
You never know.
Right.

1317
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,570
I'm just.
That's so funny that you said that.

1318
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,350
I'll tell you why later.
I won't remember.

1319
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,350
I have a thing about almond milk over.
Like it's one of the,

1320
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,050
one of the punchlines is that humans 
don't have tits stupid.

1321
00:57:32,051 --> 00:57:35,140
You can't get milk out of an almond.
Like don't call it milk.

1322
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,500
Like almond milk,
almond milk,

1323
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:43,800
rice milk.
It's Whitewater Weird fucking cup water 

1324
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,010
doesn't come from a nipple.
You fuckhead.

1325
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,870
But that's like a whole bit.
I did.

1326
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:48,460
So when you said that almond shaped 
nipples,

1327
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:53,461
it's hilarious.
He surprised part of the Vegan bit and 

1328
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:53,461
surprise.
You don't rock an ipad like an,

1329
00:57:53,461 --> 00:57:54,730
like a small ipad.
This is a small ipad.

1330
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:57,190
I mean essentially it is.
I don't need dude,

1331
00:57:57,191 --> 00:58:00,520
when I go on the road,
I oftentimes don't even touch my laptop.

1332
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,950
I just fuck around with his phone the 
whole weekend,

1333
00:58:02,951 --> 00:58:05,800
like answering emails and stuff,
doing that work stuff.

1334
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,170
That's pretty cool.
It's the big one for me,

1335
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:09,010
man,
is this,

1336
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:14,011
the big one for me is the set lists that
I can write my set list down to instead 

1337
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:16,320
of a piece of paper.
I like having it in my pocket.

1338
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,640
I do too,
but I like this too.

1339
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,820
This is also,
it's like it doesn't replace it totally.

1340
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:24,640
I still carry a notebook everywhere.
That would have been a lot better when I

1341
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:29,641
was using those,
but the thing I like is as I flipped 

1342
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:29,641
through to find the note that I want,
I see the old notes.

1343
00:58:29,641 --> 00:58:32,950
I'm like eventually it will come out on 
stage because I keep seeing it.

1344
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:34,690
When I was writing notes in evernote or 
something,

1345
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:37,090
I wouldn't see the old notes once I made
a point to go back to them.

1346
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,490
Well my notebook.
There's a difference between my notebook

1347
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:42,760
and this is I would say more of like my 
idea book,

1348
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:48,030
like this is where I'll throw ideas in 
what I want to write them down and I'll 

1349
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,470
throw like set lists,
but like my notebook is more like what I

1350
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:51,910
do before I go onstage.

1351
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:56,970
One of the big ones is I write down all 
the different shit that I want to talk 

1352
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:56,970
about,
make sure that I like,

1353
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:01,800
that's how I remember and that's how I,
it helps me like make sure that I don't 

1354
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,451
leave anything out to give me like all 
these little points and then physically 

1355
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:06,700
writing down,
I sort of,

1356
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:11,730
it sort of cemented in my head.
So if you go over and look through my 

1357
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,401
notebook,
you'll see like the same notes over and 

1358
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:14,401
over and over again.
I'm like,

1359
00:59:14,401 --> 00:59:15,280
are you fucking crazy?
Because I'm just feeling inside.

1360
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,490
I'm just filling in the space.
It helps you remember?

1361
00:59:18,491 --> 00:59:19,160
Definitely,
yes.

1362
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,980
And then occasionally I write new things

1363
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,090
there but I put a big black star next to
new things that are right there.

1364
00:59:26,091 --> 00:59:31,091
So what I use a notebook for and what I 
use like my computer for a totally 

1365
00:59:31,091 --> 00:59:35,231
different,
like a very rarely write a bit on a 

1366
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:35,780
notebook because I can type so much 
faster than I could write.

1367
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,410
It seems stupid to me.
I,

1368
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:39,100
if I have a great idea for a bit I'll 
read.

1369
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,570
I'll jot down what the idea is real 
quick.

1370
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,460
But then I do all the writing on an 
actual laptop.

1371
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:43,880
Oh,
right,

1372
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:44,120
right.

1373
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:49,320
I'm have to write longhand.
I don't think you could fuck with the 

1374
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:49,320
camera though on the iphone.
Unfortunately.

1375
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:54,710
That's the only thing that keeps me from
going 100 percent from was better than 

1376
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,040
better.
Quicker.

1377
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,670
Apparently the galaxy five though is a 
little bad.

1378
00:59:58,671 --> 01:00:00,290
Oxy Five.
That's the Google one,

1379
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,160
right?
Yeah.

1380
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:04,970
Apparently the camera's pretty dope.
Have you guys ever broken your iphone?

1381
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,290
Yes.
You have.

1382
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,320
You have dropped.
It just dropped the regular drop into 

1383
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,320
the shadows.
Yeah.

1384
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:11,530
It smashed him.
Believe it or almost me neither.

1385
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,070
I've dropped it a billion times.
My,

1386
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:15,560
my iphone just does things like what 
it's doing now.

1387
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,360
Like things start,
stop working.

1388
01:00:17,361 --> 01:00:19,290
Like my speaker doesn't work.
Yeah.

1389
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:24,291
That's what happens.
It goes off when you have 25 percent 

1390
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:24,291
battery life left,
but just like,

1391
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:24,291
no,
we're going off on.

1392
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,350
You plug it back in and you still have 
25 percent once you started up again.

1393
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,050
She was a new thing that happens when 
you just can't trust it.

1394
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,000
Really have an alarm because my,
after I updated the last firm,

1395
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,870
I stopped doing that stupid shit.
Oh really?

1396
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:41,390
Like,
or were you just sitting there on your 

1397
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:41,390
phone?
Just suddenly has been as the CIA,

1398
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,940
the NSA,
digging in your Dick Pics.

1399
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,430
I talked to one mother fucker.
I'm just going to reboot them.

1400
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:48,110
I'm tired of looking at a giant shoe 
Dick.

1401
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,880
Just see what they're doing now where 
they're just like the like,

1402
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:50,750
all right,
we're gonna make the.

1403
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,780
We're not going to spawn here.
We're going to have the phone companies 

1404
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:55,780
store for like,
you know,

1405
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:55,780
up to a few years.
I'm like,

1406
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:58,970
that's still have access to all our.
Still ridiculous.

1407
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,680
Still ridiculous.
It's just more.

1408
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,720
They said this ahead of time,
like,

1409
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,720
look what Obama's going to.
He's not going to reel it in.

1410
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:04,610
He's just going to rename it

1411
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,760
and people are,
there's,

1412
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:11,910
there's good points on both sides and 
one thing that people go over all the 

1413
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,910
time,
they always say like,

1414
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:17,070
hey,
if you're not a criminal then it's not 

1415
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,721
gonna affect.
You don't waste any time thinking about 

1416
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:18,721
it.
That's not true.

1417
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:19,450
And this is why it's not true.
This is the big one.

1418
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,720
It's not true because like let's say 
that you were running for office and 

1419
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:25,480
let's say,
you know,

1420
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,450
they could,
you maybe you'd be a great mayor,

1421
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:31,890
maybe you know,
maybe have really good causes in,

1422
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,410
but maybe your fucking secretly gay.
Oh yeah,

1423
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:36,250
sure.
You know,

1424
01:01:36,251 --> 01:01:41,251
and maybe they could find that shit out 
before you come out and give it to a 

1425
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:41,800
reporter.
Absolutely.

1426
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,020
Or maybe your cards.
I would definitely do that.

1427
01:01:44,050 --> 01:01:49,050
Yeah.
Maybe you to go to get hand jobs and 

1428
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,680
they find out about your fucking horn.
Love it.

1429
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,380
Love it.
You're fucking going to.

1430
01:01:52,381 --> 01:01:55,530
You point to number one through 100 
bookmark.

1431
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,600
So you've got nothing to hide,
but you're like,

1432
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,760
no,
I have things to hide.

1433
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:02,230
The private things to hide and say stuff
like if you've got nothing to hide it.

1434
01:02:02,231 --> 01:02:03,700
Like what if I have two lighters?
Yeah.

1435
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:05,650
And I want to still have my two 
lighters.

1436
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,800
Like now I can't like come on man,
all this shit.

1437
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:10,750
You don't have to have anything to hide.
Yeah.

1438
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:11,770
Just leave me alone.

1439
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:16,210
This is not like,
this is not an issue where it should be.

1440
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,980
People should have access to what you 
look,

1441
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,230
what you enjoy,
what are your issues?

1442
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,110
It gets to that like red scare thing of 
the 19 fifties,

1443
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,520
the McCarthy era.
I mean that's really what people,

1444
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,730
what they have to stop criminals that 
stop terrorists.

1445
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:30,330
It's like,
okay,

1446
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,370
but we have a set of rules in place 
already.

1447
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,100
Do you have to do it that way?
That's why we make cops like,

1448
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:35,990
well that stuff criminals.
Yes.

1449
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,710
But if you want to start somebodies 
house,

1450
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:39,470
you need a warrant.
Yeah.

1451
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:41,520
I don't know how it feels to stop 
criminals.

1452
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,950
I don't know how effective they are 
stopping crime by.

1453
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:46,560
They will never.
They just keep pointing to that.

1454
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:47,670
They have,
they have,

1455
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
uh,
a memos that they all sent out to each 

1456
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:53,430
other saying,
use nine slash 11 to justify this.

1457
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:54,630
Yeah,
I've seen that.

1458
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,930
It's pretty horrible.
It said,

1459
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,490
well,
you know what?

1460
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,950
I'm still doing it.
We're like,

1461
01:02:58,951 --> 01:02:59,790
oh,
no control.

1462
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:04,791
Let them do whatever they want.
I'm thinking of becoming a narrow list 

1463
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:04,791
thing of saying fuck it.
Just a nihilist.

1464
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:05,040
Like,
I don't care.

1465
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:06,360
Fine,
do whatever you want.

1466
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:10,800
Let me just be clear.
I'm libertarian now.

1467
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:15,830
I think what you should do,
which is just continue being honest 

1468
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:18,870
about what you think about everything.
But at some point like,

1469
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,690
don't you ever feel like I'm going to do
anything?

1470
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:25,140
I don't think it does do something.
I just think it takes a long ass time.

1471
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,280
And I think one of the big things that 
it does is when people.

1472
01:03:29,281 --> 01:03:31,980
And this is going to sound kind of 
silly,

1473
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:37,010
but it is true when people make jokes 
about things that joke changes a little 

1474
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:40,620
bit of the public's perception and 
what's,

1475
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:45,621
what's your givens are based in,
in the job will like save guy like Stan 

1476
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:49,850
hope regard like you does a bit shitting
on the Tsa and you do a bit that makes a

1477
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:53,640
lot of sense and it shits on the TSA is 
that bit becomes popular,

1478
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:58,641
that bit gets out there into,
makes people feel a little bit worse 

1479
01:03:58,641 --> 01:03:58,641
universe.

1480
01:03:58,641 --> 01:04:02,390
But then what happens?
Well then what happens is public 

1481
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:03,150
perception changes and what the public 
perception changes.

1482
01:04:03,151 --> 01:04:07,140
It starts to shift who people voted on 
based on what they support and what they

1483
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:12,141
don't support.
So if you go over a certain threshold 

1484
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:12,540
where like all these people want this 
and eventually the boat for them.

1485
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,960
But like legalize marijuana,
there's no,

1486
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:19,080
there's no candidate where you can 
actually get that even though most 

1487
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:19,080
people want it.
It's moving that direction.

1488
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:23,241
And it really is.
I mean it's obviously moving in that 

1489
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:23,241
direction cause something like that 
though.

1490
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:26,751
You'd probably need like 75 percent or 
something where the old people are 

1491
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:27,000
outnumbered.
Well,

1492
01:04:27,001 --> 01:04:32,001
you really need is money and that's what
what they have now and money changes 

1493
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,950
perceptions mean the reason.
One of the reasons why advertising,

1494
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:37,800
CNN things you're seeing on weed,
the Sanjay Gupta pieces.

1495
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,260
It's not just that it's true,
it's not.

1496
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:45,260
That was because there's a public shift 
in perception and that public shift in 

1497
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:50,931
perception accepts things that it would 
have thought of as drugs during the 

1498
01:04:50,931 --> 01:04:51,410
Nancy Reagan administration.
You know,

1499
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:53,310
Nancy Reagan was doing that just ain't 
no shit.

1500
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,520
You could have never had sonjay gooped 
on CNN and realize they can get Sanjay 

1501
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,250
Gupta talking about like how we should 
be good and we're like,

1502
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,420
oh,
we can actually get viewers.

1503
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:05,450
If you put that on.
We got a lot of people who want to say 

1504
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:05,450
it's definitely that,
but there's also like what's going on in

1505
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:10,011
Colorado is the amount of money that's 
being generated by weed is undeniable 

1506
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:13,581
now and they get so much and there's so 
much going on that it gets to a certain 

1507
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,580
point in time where people are like,
hey,

1508
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:18,880
there's no crime spree starts 
influencing all the politicians.

1509
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,120
The money starts influencing all these 
different people in our corner for once 

1510
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,000
it comes to marijuana lobby essentially.

1511
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,440
Yeah.
We were just.

1512
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,080
But that's the problem with that.
That should be.

1513
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,830
That should even be allowed to have to 
work what?

1514
01:05:31,831 --> 01:05:32,470
Okay.
Yeah,

1515
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,490
I agree with you.
It's nice that we're working in our 

1516
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:39,721
favor this time.
It's not necessarily working in our 

1517
01:05:39,721 --> 01:05:42,331
favor either.
It's just beginning to work in our 

1518
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:42,331
favor,
but.

1519
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:45,240
So you think after a number of people 
hear about something and start to 

1520
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:45,240
influence their opinion?
Yes.

1521
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,800
Then the government will then to appease
those people will change their mind.

1522
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,190
Well,
it did.

1523
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:50,650
Change is who the government is just 
takes time.

1524
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:55,890
It changes what the culture is,
what the culture accepts with the 

1525
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:56,860
culture doesn't accept,
but it changes and it changes based on.

1526
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:00,730
A lot of it is public perception.
A lot of it can be influenced by art and

1527
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:05,731
music.
Things that get out there that get 

1528
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:05,731
people to resonate and his ideas and 
then money.

1529
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:09,010
Money is the other big one.
So when the thing is it has all of them.

1530
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:12,920
There's all these things and money.
Yeah.

1531
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:15,160
So when a big business come in and say,
okay,

1532
01:06:15,161 --> 01:06:20,161
well maybe 50 percent of people are 
against something and it will be on our 

1533
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:21,220
best interest to like if you,
if they're not against it,

1534
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:26,221
if they're for it.
So they just come in and say if there's 

1535
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:26,221
maybe 50 percent of people against it 
for the percent of people for it,

1536
01:06:26,221 --> 01:06:31,020
they want to shift that and the 
politician's mind the importance of 

1537
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:32,710
definitely.
And that you support that CNN and things

1538
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:33,060
like,
you know,

1539
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:35,650
have a television show that shows the 
positive side of weed.

1540
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:37,990
That will definitely shift thing.
Or like the unions in New York,

1541
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:42,991
they're trying to keep mma out.
Whether like just get through to the 

1542
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:42,991
look,
look at this guys,

1543
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:43,520
brain damage,
barbaric.

1544
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,580
Nicholas Chicago politicians go,
ha,

1545
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,410
that's a stat.
I've seen that stat.

1546
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:49,150
So yeah,
there's,

1547
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:54,210
there's most certainly that.
What you're seeing with like what's 

1548
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,280
going on in Colorado too is that people 
are getting old enough to that.

1549
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,070
The people that are like in their 
twenties and thirties that are voting,

1550
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:03,280
they've grown up with the internet and 
they know it's bullshit.

1551
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,760
You're not going to own them the way you
own 50 year old people today.

1552
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,230
You're not going to.
Someone's saying this.

1553
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:10,330
That's why Arizona always vote so 
conservative.

1554
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:15,410
It's the old people moving there and 
it's not the main regular people in 

1555
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:15,610
Phoenix and tempe and stuff.
They're cool,

1556
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:20,640
but it's like old people and they vote 
and way higher numbers and they are 

1557
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,280
afraid of stuff.
Do you think that the older you get,

1558
01:07:21,281 --> 01:07:22,930
the more conservative you get?
Yes,

1559
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:24,400
because it can't just be because they 
were like,

1560
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:25,510
well,
you know when the old people die on.

1561
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:30,510
I'm like,
they have already to just from when I 

1562
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:32,971
was five,
they have already died out to an old 

1563
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:32,971
quote.
I forget who was quoted was because show

1564
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:36,010
me,
I'm a young man who's a conservative and

1565
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:41,011
I'll show you a man with no heart.
Show me an old man who's a liberal and 

1566
01:07:41,011 --> 01:07:42,310
I'll show you a man with no brain.
Huh?

1567
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:47,140
Funny.
I forget who made that quote.

1568
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:50,410
I forget where it's coming from me,
but the idea is as you get older,

1569
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:55,411
you realize a lot of what's going on is 
people need to just stop being fucking 

1570
01:07:55,411 --> 01:07:57,500
babies.
They need to get their shit together and

1571
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,280
need to.
You know,

1572
01:07:58,281 --> 01:08:03,281
you need to have stricter laws to cut 
back on the nonsense and recidivism and 

1573
01:08:03,281 --> 01:08:04,480
crime and you get tougher on crime.
As you get older,

1574
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,500
you get,
you know,

1575
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:07,360
you want your streets to be protected.
You're like,

1576
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:08,500
God dammit.
Enough is enough.

1577
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,600
I'm 65 years old.
You're going to go out.

1578
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:11,410
So like,
who cares,

1579
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,690
kill 'em,
all Kev,

1580
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:16,010
all these goddamn criminals.
You start getting that of an attitude.

1581
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:21,490
You also start going like,
I like things done the way they've been 

1582
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:24,641
done and so you just don't want change.
So I think a lot of times with gay 

1583
01:08:24,641 --> 01:08:24,641
marriage,
things like that,

1584
01:08:24,641 --> 01:08:26,390
it's the same kind of like a push back 
that you'll get when,

1585
01:08:26,391 --> 01:08:31,391
uh,
when the Catholic church turned the 

1586
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:31,391
priest around,
[inaudible] father told me that,

1587
01:08:31,391 --> 01:08:33,350
like they,
everybody went crazy,

1588
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,200
turn the priests around,
one point he was facing the audience and

1589
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:41,201
then the big,
the Catholic thing that they all deal 

1590
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:41,201
with the big meeting they've had to 
have,

1591
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:41,390
you know.
Yeah,

1592
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:42,920
a Vatican two,
whatever it was.

1593
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:43,640
Then they say,
okay,

1594
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:47,150
now you face the arc or whatever the 
front with the people or vice versa.

1595
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:48,140
Okay.
Turn him around.

1596
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,410
And he goes,
remember our parents losing their minds,

1597
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,990
no way to worship.
Well you kidding me,

1598
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,790
and now I want you to take it for 
granted because that's the way it's been

1599
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:57,620
done.
There's no way to worship.

1600
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,710
And people go crazy because they want it
done their way.

1601
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:05,860
And when you've used this something for 
50 years of your life and suddenly it 

1602
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:05,860
changed.
Wait,

1603
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:05,930
two guys are getting married.
No,

1604
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:07,850
this is not the way I like it.

1605
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:12,940
This is against the sanctimony to 
sanctity of a marriage.

1606
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:18,330
It's the same shit that when your,
when your favorite restaurant takes an 

1607
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:18,330
item off the menu,
like what not.

1608
01:09:18,330 --> 01:09:18,880
That was the.
I like that item.

1609
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:21,220
I want it done my way.
Hmm.

1610
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,280
I don't know if a restaurant taking item
off the menu because of the same place 

1611
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,450
for them.
They want it done their way.

1612
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:30,580
They've been going to that restaurant 
for 45 years.

1613
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,170
What do you mean yelling at a club 
sandwich anymore.

1614
01:09:32,171 --> 01:09:33,340
That's my.
That was my thing.

1615
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,660
People don't resist change and I think a
lot of that is insecurity.

1616
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:43,040
That's a lot of it.
I think a lot of it is a that did just 

1617
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,951
scared.
People are scared of marriage is one 

1618
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:46,951
that does not affect the people not 
involved in it.

1619
01:09:46,951 --> 01:09:47,940
Brian,
pull up the story.

1620
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,340
The Dea,
a cops raid woman's home after she shops

1621
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:53,760
at an indoor garden center

1622
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,510
because they're there.
They're watching what?

1623
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:00,570
She's right where she was because the 
dea thinks she's growing marijuana.

1624
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,670
I saw that in the trash.
They took the trash out.

1625
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:04,130
They didn't test the shit.
Yeah.

1626
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,390
So how do they even know about it?
I mean,

1627
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:08,040
it's crazy.
Nothing to hide.

1628
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:13,220
Well yeah,
but meanwhile they busted into my house 

1629
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,320
and did a bunch of damage.
She came under investigation just 

1630
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:15,320
because she shopped a store,
you know,

1631
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,130
Indoor Garden Center.
So they thought maybe she was building a

1632
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:19,020
bond with that without fertilizer or 
something.

1633
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:20,580
I

1634
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,760
thought she was growing weed.
That's what they thought.

1635
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:26,500
But the idea is that this woman didn't 
get caught for any other crimes,

1636
01:10:26,501 --> 01:10:31,501
so they have a warrant.
They went through her garbage and they 

1637
01:10:31,501 --> 01:10:34,481
stormed her home and an early morning 
raid after spotting her shopping at an 

1638
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:37,130
indoor garden center that they had been 
staking out.

1639
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,420
Like,
come on man.

1640
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:42,230
There's a real problem with our lives 
when you're going after people.

1641
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:44,450
Yeah.
Two books on how to grow marijuana.

1642
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:47,120
They found some,
some weed stuff in her house.

1643
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,780
So they were.
So what zip drive from 1982.

1644
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:52,880
Yeah.
That's hilarious.

1645
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,640
But so what the point is,
first of all,

1646
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,010
get people will abuse power.
Guess what?

1647
01:10:58,011 --> 01:11:03,011
There's no,
there's nothing wrong with fucking 

1648
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:03,011
marijuana.
Okay.

1649
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:04,170
Can we just establish that?
Can we stop at the ball and like five of

1650
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:09,220
the dea.
Why would the dea thinks that it's okay 

1651
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,330
to stake out a fucking garden center and
then break into people's houses?

1652
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,500
So what did they find when they broke 
into her house?

1653
01:11:13,501 --> 01:11:14,020
They found

1654
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,130
shared like nine grams of marijuana.
Oh No.

1655
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:18,330
Really?
Her own stuff.

1656
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,030
Yeah.
So they said they found nine point three

1657
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:24,750
grams of marijuana in her art room.
Jesus Christ.

1658
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:28,230
So she smokes weed and does art.
And what happened?

1659
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,630
They broke her fucking house,
door down,

1660
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:34,080
rated it with guns.
Here's my friend told me about it.

1661
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,280
Once in a minute,
it's pretty clear.

1662
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:37,650
He goes,
I get a government not wanting you to do

1663
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:39,270
certain things.
I don't agree with it,

1664
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:41,340
but I get it.
Don't smoke marijuana,

1665
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:44,670
but if you are,
if you are smoking pot or doing whatever

1666
01:11:44,671 --> 01:11:48,750
you're doing in your own home for them,
just tell you you need to surrender your

1667
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:53,751
freedom.
Now the one thing you're granted as a 

1668
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:54,480
citizen of this country is your freedom 
and say you have to give that up now for

1669
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:59,481
up to a year or two.
We're taking their freedom from you and 

1670
01:11:59,481 --> 01:11:59,481
you can never vote again because we 
caught you.

1671
01:11:59,481 --> 01:11:59,900
That thing.
That's a whole nother pr.

1672
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,700
That's a whole nother whole nother thing
and here's the other part of it.

1673
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:07,910
They.
They investigated a month long 

1674
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:10,500
investigation that involved federal 
agents searching through her garbage and

1675
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:14,670
comparing her electric bill to those 
have a couple neighbors.

1676
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:20,120
They searched through her garbage and 
checked her electric bill and that the 

1677
01:12:20,371 --> 01:12:24,750
fact that she was spending money on 
electricity for whatever fucking reason,

1678
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,120
a bunch of other stuff.
I'm sure she was,

1679
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:32,080
but who cares if she was growing wheat?
The idea that the on the,

1680
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,470
on the presumption like,
oh look what you're doing.

1681
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:34,890
Where it's like,
no,

1682
01:12:34,891 --> 01:12:36,300
she just had some in her house.
Well,

1683
01:12:36,301 --> 01:12:39,690
the only reason they arrested her.
The only reason why they did it,

1684
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:43,170
the only reason why the investigator it 
was she was shopping at a garden store.

1685
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,000
I mean,
that is fucking crazy.

1686
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,360
You can't just do that.
How long until the government fucks with

1687
01:12:48,361 --> 01:12:50,340
you until you say fucking slap their 
hand away.

1688
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52,890
Well,
this is one want to fund that.

1689
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:57,950
Another one is recent because this one 
is people that actually were dea agents 

1690
01:12:59,101 --> 01:13:03,030
that we're breaking down the door and 
they were looking for um,

1691
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:03,830
you know,
on,

1692
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:05,010
on,
on civilians.

1693
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:08,390
He pay attention on the fuck you doing.
Looking around for something that I want

1694
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,640
more.
I'm still listening.

1695
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,450
Will have to roll a joint.
What did I say?

1696
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:14,700
What we're talking about?
Civilians busting the door down.

1697
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,470
The thing where you just,
you just,

1698
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,610
you don't,
you haven't listened,

1699
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,640
but you pretend you still place a couple
of words.

1700
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:25,641
The point is they did it recently to 
these two former CIA agents growing 

1701
01:13:25,641 --> 01:13:27,600
tomatoes and the fucking,
the feds.

1702
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:31,320
The dea broke down their fucking door 
and came in guns drawn.

1703
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,320
These were former CIA agents because 
they were growing tomatoes actually in 

1704
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:42,460
their garbage.
They said it's weird and they didn't 

1705
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,440
test it.
They actually had vegetables like there,

1706
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:48,441
there were doing it totally legit.
Just trying to grow vegetables in their 

1707
01:13:48,441 --> 01:13:51,180
basement and the cops use that as an 
excuse to break down your door and point

1708
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:56,181
guns at you.
If that doesn't show how bananas 

1709
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:58,371
everything's gotten,
if they think it's okay to actually 

1710
01:13:58,371 --> 01:14:00,621
point guns at people because they're 
growing something that's fucking crazy,

1711
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:04,020
that's just fucking crazy.
The fact that these cops think that it's

1712
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:09,021
okay to do that.
Whoever it is is giving them the 

1713
01:14:09,021 --> 01:14:09,510
direction,
whatever fucking help guide or happy cop

1714
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:14,511
like they have in Albuquerque,
they should dogs on them almost 

1715
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:16,831
immediately when you shoot them,
even small dogs and they do it to scare 

1716
01:14:16,831 --> 01:14:21,811
the fuck out of people.
I mean they also do it to let them know 

1717
01:14:21,811 --> 01:14:21,811
like,
this is real shit.

1718
01:14:21,811 --> 01:14:22,600
I just shot your dog.
I will shoot you.

1719
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:28,030
Then they'll.
They did do it to intimidate people and 

1720
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:28,030
they do it because a lot of them are 
just fucking sadistic.

1721
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,490
Says Crazy Shit,
man,

1722
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,980
man.
Crazy shit.

1723
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:36,280
That is unacceptable in a civilized 
society.

1724
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:39,100
It's unacceptable.
The idea that this is a good thing.

1725
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:43,330
The idea that you're protecting anybody 
from anything like that in any way,

1726
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:44,740
shape or form.
This guy saying,

1727
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,720
you have to knock life better.
Record cops.

1728
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:48,130
All those like,
that's not true.

1729
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:50,200
Then you can record.
Kafka doesn't let them do their job.

1730
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,120
It's just keeps them accountable.
Yeah,

1731
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,130
you're supposed to.
You're supposed to be able to record,

1732
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,660
but there are some states where you're 
not allowed.

1733
01:14:55,661 --> 01:15:00,661
Right.
I think there are a few states that are 

1734
01:15:00,661 --> 01:15:00,661
fighting it,
but that shit's ridiculous.

1735
01:15:00,661 --> 01:15:04,201
Like you're recording news,
like it's actually happening and when 

1736
01:15:04,201 --> 01:15:04,380
cops are being recorded,
like they.

1737
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:09,420
Did you see that thing that I tweeted 
about la having cops were these things 

1738
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:10,930
about Korean?
Everything they do.

1739
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,310
Oh really?
And when they do it,

1740
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,820
they found a drastic decrease in 
complaints.

1741
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:17,890
A drastic decrease in.
Yeah.

1742
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:18,490
It's like,
yeah,

1743
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,900
beyond the record.
Yeah,

1744
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:20,920
of course.
Yeah.

1745
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:23,230
I forgot the actual statistics,
but they're are pretty fucking shot.

1746
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:28,260
They want to record all of us,
but they don't want us to record the 

1747
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:28,450
cops at all of them.
Exactly.

1748
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:33,451
It's hilarious.
It's congress still exempt from 

1749
01:15:33,451 --> 01:15:33,451
obamacare.
Do they exempt themselves?

1750
01:15:33,451 --> 01:15:37,920
I don't know,
but somebody had a really fucking good 

1751
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:37,920
point the other day.
What was ever said.

1752
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,390
They said,
how is it not insane that you're talking

1753
01:15:40,391 --> 01:15:45,391
about a country that doesn't force 
people to have proof of their 

1754
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:50,170
citizenship but does to have proof of 
your health insurance?

1755
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,990
Do you know how crazy that is?

1756
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,760
They're crazy,
so crazy.

1757
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:59,770
They're saying you don't have to give 
proof of being a citizen of this 

1758
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,810
country,
so you can be an illegal alien.

1759
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:04,360
No one.
Everybody will leave you alone,

1760
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:10,860
but you do have to have proof of the 
fact that you're paying an insurance 

1761
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:15,121
company money so shitty.
It's when we sell this people picketing 

1762
01:16:15,121 --> 01:16:19,951
in Tempe.
The last time I think we all went there 

1763
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:19,951
and I was like near the mall and I was 
like,

1764
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,690
what if picketing for it was the first 
time I was like,

1765
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,880
they must be a reason why these 100 
people are out,

1766
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,760
and then I realized later it's like,
because I just thought it was like,

1767
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:32,820
yeah,
I got to make sure everyone gets health 

1768
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:32,820
care,
but now it's like another.

1769
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:35,700
You're forcing everyone to buy insurance
so the insurance company can still make 

1770
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:35,700
a lot of early.

1771
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:40,680
The way it's been explained to me,
it's not obamacare as much as it's the 

1772
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,790
affordable care act,
which is tacked onto obamacare.

1773
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:44,480
There's,
you know,

1774
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,040
whenever you have bills that are,
that have good intentions,

1775
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:53,110
all sorts of special interest attached 
there needs to bills and things that get

1776
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,560
passed off and have these clauses that 
have no nothing to do with it.

1777
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,970
Yeah.
Not only have nothing to do,

1778
01:16:57,971 --> 01:17:02,971
but they have like far ranging 
implications on the simpsons when they 

1779
01:17:02,971 --> 01:17:06,540
were trying to get out of town,
like the built a vacuum at the simpsons 

1780
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:06,540
because the media was gonna hit them.
It's like all in favor.

1781
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,260
It's like I'd like to tack on a pro 
pornography bill with that.

1782
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,000
They all voted against it and I'm like,
ah,

1783
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,310
and that is what they do and can back 
and was like,

1784
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:14,750
this is why democracy doesn't work.

1785
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:16,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1786
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:21,431
So they tack on Shit.
So with the affordable care act is 

1787
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:21,431
different than obamacare.
Allegedly.

1788
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:25,750
I haven't investigated enough.
Peter Schiff will probably know his 

1789
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:28,391
time.
He has a podcast probably educate me on 

1790
01:17:28,391 --> 01:17:28,391
it,
saying they fucking gets crazy and start

1791
01:17:28,391 --> 01:17:30,050
screaming about it.
Insurance companies aren't like good,

1792
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,240
it's not like good at what they do and 
then you're like,

1793
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:37,270
well,
too bad you have to have that bad deal 

1794
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,550
about the idea of insurance.
It's fucking crazy.

1795
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:42,580
The idea that you're going to gamble 
whether or not you get sick or hurting 

1796
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,120
coggins fucked up and if it does,
these people pay for it,

1797
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:46,490
like the whole economy sort of pay for 
it.

1798
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:51,550
They'll enemy of credit and the whole 
economy of like being able to purchase 

1799
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:55,961
things in advance that you can pay off.
All of that is like a kind of financial 

1800
01:17:56,451 --> 01:18:00,050
indentured servitude and almost everyone
falls into it.

1801
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:05,280
When you want to talk about college,
College on the grid begin before you 

1802
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,360
have any show and they got you in debt 
already and they get used to it for free

1803
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:13,361
tee shirt that's has fucking umass on it
or what's going on with college 

1804
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:16,070
sweatshirt was his name.
Belushi Lucia.

1805
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:18,890
Yeah,
one of those on white.

1806
01:18:18,990 --> 01:18:20,690
I don't even a cool one.
Yeah,

1807
01:18:20,691 --> 01:18:22,670
you.
If you really stop and think about it,

1808
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:24,200
that is exactly what happens,
right?

1809
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,680
You go to college and they know these 
kids don't have any income,

1810
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:30,980
but they're still giving credit cards.
They know they don't have income.

1811
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,010
They will only default and they're 
chocking up all this debt before.

1812
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:40,080
I mean,
think about the idea that you have to 

1813
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,220
pay for four years of,
of living.

1814
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:42,400
That's a bad deal to after it's over.
Yeah.

1815
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:45,650
Yeah.
Like four years of everything for a year

1816
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:49,070
you have to pay for four years of back.

1817
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:54,490
Pay It back.
Like if you had to do four years of 

1818
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:54,490
anything and then pay it after it's 
over.

1819
01:18:54,490 --> 01:18:57,040
What a mess that would you imagine if 
like you,

1820
01:18:57,041 --> 01:19:01,180
you like all your food went on credit.
I just finished my,

1821
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:04,220
my student loans just paid it this year.
Last year.

1822
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,330
You paid them off scare a long time ago.
Oh Wow.

1823
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:13,360
That's so scary and doesn't want me to 
but like 85 bucks a month more than.

1824
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,770
I think that's probably why.
Yeah.

1825
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,940
For this deal.
It's like,

1826
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:18,200
well,
it's not even a good deal.

1827
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,400
Well,
it's the only way to get a career 

1828
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,841
though.
I guess you have to pay for college and 

1829
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:27,860
everyone going up to jack it up.
Some scholarship scholarships are pretty

1830
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:32,861
sweet.
Private schools cost a shitload now to 

1831
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:34,970
fuck you and I do feel like 15,
20 grand at least more.

1832
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,740
Even when I was going to was five or 
seven.

1833
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,630
Some of them are 30,
30,000

1834
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,940
to educate a fucking seven year old.
Yeah.

1835
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:43,440
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1836
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,400
Oh Wow.
Just for smaller classes.

1837
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,280
Yeah.
Well,

1838
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:52,300
for more individualized attention for 
goods teaching for good students look 

1839
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:56,411
bad.
I mean we were all smarter resource 

1840
01:19:56,411 --> 01:19:58,810
resource loss in this country.
A lot of it goes from kids being 

1841
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:00,890
disinterested in education.
That's a great resource.

1842
01:20:00,891 --> 01:20:01,880
Laws,
people,

1843
01:20:01,881 --> 01:20:06,881
people doing a shitty job of raising 
their kids and then kids getting shitty 

1844
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:06,881
teachers.
Yeah.

1845
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:09,060
They have this out as like,
well parents got to do a better job.

1846
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:10,080
It's like okay,
but they're not.

1847
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,730
So then what?
It's not just that.

1848
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:13,950
It's also dealing with other parents 
work.

1849
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:19,100
Like when you send your kid to school,
you're not just dealing with your 

1850
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:19,170
parenting and what you've done for your 
child.

1851
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:24,320
You're also giving other kids that are a
mass and you can see shitty parents and 

1852
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:29,571
you could see all this different shit 
that happens with kids that are just 

1853
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:30,240
real fucking nightmares.

1854
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:35,420
Real crazy.
Kids disrupt classes like it's not just 

1855
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,211
your kid,
it's everybody doing a shitty job of 

1856
01:20:38,211 --> 01:20:41,571
raising kids.
It's not just you making sure that you 

1857
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:44,151
do a good job.
Kids going to have to deal with dummies 

1858
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:44,490
friends too.
It's nurture just beyond you.

1859
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,220
There's a lot of shit going on.
What's on TV too?

1860
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,960
Let's to play apart.
Well,

1861
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:53,961
that's where community really comes into
place and that's what I kind of 

1862
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:55,380
understand.
Gossiping way more now.

1863
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:56,670
You know?
I understand.

1864
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:57,660
Oh,
explain that.

1865
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:02,900
That's interesting.
I understand gossiping way more now 

1866
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,170
because the more things get fucked up in
your community,

1867
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:09,230
the more like in situations like raising
children and so they're all kind of 

1868
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:12,290
aware of what the soldier.
I heard so and so's son is dealing.

1869
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:14,010
You'll also hear like,
oh,

1870
01:21:14,011 --> 01:21:19,011
this guy likes to scream at his family.
You hear him yelling at his wife and 

1871
01:21:19,011 --> 01:21:19,200
you're yelling and you're like,
that's.

1872
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,060
I was like,
oh,

1873
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,440
we got a problem in our community like 
this public shaming,

1874
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:23,340
public awareness.
Well,

1875
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:26,880
this gossip does.
It's also like you're trying to set some

1876
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,410
sort of a standard,
you know,

1877
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:29,670
you're trying to,
uh,

1878
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:34,970
trying to make everybody get along 
together and when you've got one person 

1879
01:21:34,970 --> 01:21:36,660
that's a fuckhead or this guy is,
he's constantly drinking,

1880
01:21:36,661 --> 01:21:41,661
he's a drunk.
You want to be aware and the community 

1881
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:41,661
of where the weak links are.
Yeah.

1882
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:42,600
Yeah.
That makes sense.

1883
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,350
Yeah.
I mean,

1884
01:21:43,351 --> 01:21:48,351
that's what it,
it's not just people mind their 

1885
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:50,391
business,
it's sort of they have to mine other 

1886
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:50,391
people's businesses because you've got 
to find out where the problems are,

1887
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:51,780
you know,
especially when you have children,

1888
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:52,850
you know,
you want to wear.

1889
01:21:52,890 --> 01:21:56,400
Look if you've got one kid that skin and
cats and doing free.

1890
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,950
That was a good to know about that kid.

1891
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:00,990
What I had really tight knit dorms.
It was always,

1892
01:22:00,991 --> 01:22:02,430
that was the biggest problem with 
gossip,

1893
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,800
but it was also coming from a place of 
like everyone's door was open.

1894
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:06,600
Everybody knew each other,
you know,

1895
01:22:06,601 --> 01:22:09,270
it was a nice thing.
Yeah.

1896
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:15,710
Yeah.
I think there's good gossip and you 

1897
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:15,710
know,
there's,

1898
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,010
there's just get ahead.
When I left,

1899
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,060
religion was like sense of community.
Right.

1900
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:21,840
That makes sense.
And then no one was gossiping about me,

1901
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:24,180
but I've lost that.
Like team.

1902
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,850
Yeah.
That sense of community is important for

1903
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:28,500
us.
It's important for human beings,

1904
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,800
you know?
I mean essentially that's what we're 

1905
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:33,800
putting together,
but you know,

1906
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,310
having this group,
but we all gossip about each other.

1907
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:37,740
Yeah.
But we do it at least lovingly.

1908
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:38,640
Yeah.
You know,

1909
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:41,940
like we actually want everybody to have 
a good time.

1910
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,300
Like we want everything to be in order,
but if we find that someone's being 

1911
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,440
retarded about some shit,
bring it up.

1912
01:22:49,490 --> 01:22:50,560
Yeah.
He liked to.

1913
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:54,050
You see what that silly bitch to do 
that,

1914
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:57,960
but because we're interested in them.
Exactly.

1915
01:22:57,990 --> 01:23:01,820
It's and it's,
it's also about some God never met.

1916
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,390
I'm bored by it.
Yeah.

1917
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:04,510
It's like,
all right,

1918
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:09,960
guy cheated on his wife,
Brian Start Smoking again because it's 

1919
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,441
cat hurt her foot.
I mean we have to talk shit about that 

1920
01:23:13,441 --> 01:23:17,281
because it's so ridiculous.
What happened is this silly bitch 

1921
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:17,370
fucking cat her.
It's foot.

1922
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,990
You and that the best reasons to start 
smoking,

1923
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:21,880
you're like,
all right,

1924
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:23,070
look,
I got to tell these guys saw,

1925
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:24,460
which I tell them,
you know,

1926
01:23:24,461 --> 01:23:29,461
I'm really into an accident.
What I'm disturbed about this cigarette 

1927
01:23:29,461 --> 01:23:30,040
band,
this electronic cigarette band,

1928
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:34,000
because I have looked into it and I,
I think it's ridiculous.

1929
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,360
Well,
I think the third hand smoke,

1930
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,520
that's what they're saying.
Now.

1931
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:39,960
What's thirdhand smoke?
I think this is ridiculous.

1932
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,240
What's third hand smoke?
If I smoke in this room,

1933
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:46,020
this room now can give you cancer for 
the rest of its life in the future.

1934
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,300
That doesn't again.
Is that real?

1935
01:23:48,301 --> 01:23:52,470
Yeah.
The reason I heard about this thing that

1936
01:23:52,471 --> 01:23:57,471
they're saying now is that there's this 
thing called third hand placement that's

1937
01:23:58,230 --> 01:24:00,820
smoked in like houses and stuff.
No Way.

1938
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:06,440
That's insane.
I thought they'd banned because people 

1939
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:06,440
were like,
this is gross.

1940
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:06,440
Everyone's smoking those things and it's
annoying.

1941
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:11,080
It's just one of those salon.com.
Is this real?

1942
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:11,880
You know,
it's awesome.

1943
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,980
I tweeted something today of this seven 
beers that you should stop drinking 

1944
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:20,811
immediately.
Like castle has like this chemical or 

1945
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:20,930
this coloring in it.
That's been proven to give you cancer.

1946
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,220
Newcastle,
Newcastle,

1947
01:24:22,470 --> 01:24:25,540
hold on.
And

1948
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:30,540
this third hand,
smoke is generally considered to be 

1949
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,481
residual nicotine and other chemicals 
left on a variety of indoor surfaces by 

1950
01:24:33,481 --> 01:24:37,231
tobacco smoke.
The residue is thought to react with 

1951
01:24:37,231 --> 01:24:39,400
common indoor pollutants to create a 
toxic mix.

1952
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:45,030
This toxic mix of thirdhand smoke 
contains cancer causing substances 

1953
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:48,610
posing a potential health hazard to 
nonsmokers who are exposed to it,

1954
01:24:48,611 --> 01:24:53,611
especially children.
So like if somebody wife's tables out 

1955
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:53,611
down,
if it had cigarette smoke,

1956
01:24:53,611 --> 01:24:55,390
like honor from smoking around a lot,
it was my wife that down,

1957
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:58,740
it would combine with that is possible 
with that.

1958
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,350
That's exactly what they're saying.
And what they're saying is that other,

1959
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:05,560
um,
indoor chemicals can create a toxic,

1960
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:10,650
a toxic mix.
So it's not that smoking in a room can 

1961
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:14,491
get you sick.
Is it smoking in the room and somebody 

1962
01:25:14,491 --> 01:25:14,491
coming in with windex,
but they're going to do that.

1963
01:25:14,491 --> 01:25:15,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

1964
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:18,070
It's the chemicals interacting.
So,

1965
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:23,071
but what I want to know,
what I'm saying is if they didn't do 

1966
01:25:23,071 --> 01:25:25,171
that,
if nobody ever cleaned it with any 

1967
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:25,171
chemicals,
there was no chemicals exposed to it.

1968
01:25:25,171 --> 01:25:26,700
Then it will just be a room that 
somebody smoked,

1969
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:32,160
but it makes sense that the walls,
that brown color that you see at pool 

1970
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,090
halls where you know,
dudes been smoking there for 50 years.

1971
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:38,400
That shit is like on the wall,
the walls he has like when you see other

1972
01:25:38,401 --> 01:25:40,330
than the ceiling above blitz with 
candles.

1973
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:41,670
Oh yeah,
just color.

1974
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:46,830
Yeah,
but that is at least just you could 

1975
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:49,021
stand on just fire smoke over the years.
It must be so deep.

1976
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:55,830
Those places like those old school 
places where it's almost like the walls 

1977
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:58,260
were yellow from small or old people's 
houses just like smells in there from,

1978
01:25:58,410 --> 01:25:59,520
from the years it's talking about.

1979
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,570
I couldn't even.
Might not even be now,

1980
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:04,310
but to it in the nineties when I started
playing pool,

1981
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:08,240
everybody in these pool hall smoked and 
the air conditioning was horrible.

1982
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,780
Really?
Ventilation was horrible and I'm so.

1983
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:15,790
So you'd go to a pool hall and you would
walk in the door and you would just 

1984
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:18,950
immediately be greeted by a cloud of 
smoke and you just dealt with it.

1985
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:24,220
That was just what you did.
You go over to the table and dudes were 

1986
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:24,280
smoking and putting their cigarette down
on the table,

1987
01:26:24,281 --> 01:26:26,960
whether a plan it was,
there was cigarette burns,

1988
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:32,170
those lead there have those gold crown 
tables and they have that sort of farm 

1989
01:26:32,170 --> 01:26:35,930
for Micah look like fake wood railings 
and there would be burns all over the 

1990
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,880
railings,
believe in people cigarettes.

1991
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:41,440
So it was super common.
But you student poker rooms where you're

1992
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:44,510
allowed and not allowed where you had to
go out to the rail.

1993
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:49,750
Wow.
So you just run out there and smoke and 

1994
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,021
this is so fucking annoying.
I was looking at my yearbook and I was 

1995
01:26:52,021 --> 01:26:54,720
like 1989.
It showed all the things that happened 

1996
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,070
in 1989.
And it says like 1989 first,

1997
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:58,070
uh,
any flights over or under three hours.

1998
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:03,071
Ban On cigarettes,
on the airplanes was 1989 only three 

1999
01:27:03,071 --> 01:27:03,200
hours.
Yeah,

2000
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,240
I can remember.
It was longer than that.

2001
01:27:05,241 --> 01:27:07,070
I can remember it.
I can remember the band.

2002
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:12,370
I can remember when it happened.
They had a curtain smoke section to 

2003
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:12,370
them,
not smoke session.

2004
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:13,580
It was hilarious.
That's hilarious.

2005
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:17,840
Imagine if you're there with your baby 
and some guy behind you is chain smoking

2006
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,920
and you're just like one row ahead.
You have a baby with you that is so 

2007
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:22,920
fucked up.
Yeah.

2008
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:27,020
They had the ashtrays in the.
In the Bay Watch was on TV.

2009
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:32,230
That's how stupid people were done was a
country Thomas couldn't check out this 

2010
01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:37,061
article,
eight beers that you should stop 

2011
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:38,090
drinking immediately because it has all 
these chemicals in what article?

2012
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:40,310
Number one is new and put it up on the 
screen.

2013
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:45,340
Number one is new castle,
kind of a caramel color in class three 

2014
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:47,330
and class four Karma color.
That's made with ammonia,

2015
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:53,050
God,
and it has cancer causing qualities in 

2016
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:53,050
it.
Oh,

2017
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,590
why would they have a fete color to 
their beer?

2018
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:59,620
So make it seem beer.
I will not buy you now because you're a 

2019
01:27:59,620 --> 01:27:59,620
fake bitch.
Budweiser.

2020
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:03,821
Let's see what that has.
Gmo Modified Gmo corn in it and gmo rice

2021
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:06,170
is anheuser busch.
I'm not sure.

2022
01:28:06,171 --> 01:28:08,690
It's not as bad as cancer.
Here's the thing,

2023
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,370
man.
I'm not sure if it's even bad for you at

2024
01:28:10,371 --> 01:28:15,371
all.
There's there's two sides of the fence 

2025
01:28:15,371 --> 01:28:15,371
on that.
GMO,

2026
01:28:15,371 --> 01:28:15,960
they won't allow you to research it.
Right?

2027
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,240
Wait a minute.
Is that true?

2028
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:18,920
Yeah.
They just tried to ban everything.

2029
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,750
They can't be sued for anything they do 
wrong.

2030
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:23,540
All those people,
they just try to get the shit out there.

2031
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,310
Well,
we'll certainly there.

2032
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:30,430
There's people that are profiting that 
are trying to curb the regulations as 

2033
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,070
much as possible to maximize their 
profits.

2034
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,210
For sure.
That's happening.

2035
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:37,570
My question is,
is there anything that shows that GMO 

2036
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:41,021
corn is bad for you?
Because there's apparently has nothing 

2037
01:28:41,021 --> 01:28:44,560
for you in general has no nutrients.
It's got carbohydrates.

2038
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,280
Carbohydrate mean there's something 
corn,

2039
01:28:46,281 --> 01:28:48,260
but yeah,
your body doesn't digest it very well.

2040
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,910
That's why he's always hitting your 
shit.

2041
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,890
Yeah.
That's why you see coronary poop because

2042
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:53,030
your body's like,
what is this man?

2043
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,320
Exactly.
Wow.

2044
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:59,500
Well,
if you've ever seen that king corn 

2045
01:28:59,500 --> 01:28:59,500
documentary.
No,

2046
01:28:59,500 --> 01:28:59,500
but that's a good man.
I let that.

2047
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:00,660
We'll put it on out there.
What?

2048
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:02,250
Play some Florida.
It's pretty dope.

2049
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:07,660
Um,
and it shows you how deep the corn 

2050
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:08,430
industry has its grip.
That Gore America food.

2051
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:11,190
Yeah.
Like high fructose corn syrup.

2052
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,990
Kevin Smith told us about it.
Man,

2053
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:14,940
remember he was,
when he did the podcast,

2054
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:17,670
he was the one who told me to check it 
out,

2055
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,770
but they.
It's in everything man.

2056
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,110
High Fructose Corn Syrup.
Yeah,

2057
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:26,120
that's replacing sugar.
Replace sugar in so many different 

2058
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:26,120
things.
Just doesn't seem as bad.

2059
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:26,950
Government subsidies,
dude,

2060
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:31,980
there's government subsidies to give.
The government gives corn farmers money 

2061
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:36,741
and incentives to grow more corn.
They grow corn for cattle feed and then 

2062
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:40,941
the cattle feed makes cows fatter,
so you're dealing with these corn fed 

2063
01:29:40,941 --> 01:29:44,570
cows and they're like really fat and 
sloppy and delicious and sometimes they 

2064
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:48,381
get like ulcers in their stomachs 
because their stomachs are not designed 

2065
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:48,381
to process corn.
Oh really?

2066
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:53,191
Really fat and like when you see a steak
at the market like you were seeing as a 

2067
01:29:53,191 --> 01:29:54,180
sick cow,
look at all the mumbling,

2068
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:59,220
Darlene,
this is going to make a delicious steak 

2069
01:29:59,220 --> 01:29:59,220
on the grill.

2070
01:29:59,220 --> 01:29:59,850
With that is is a fucking sick animal 
really?

2071
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:01,290
Because you're giving them nutrients.
Well,

2072
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:04,530
you're giving too much fat,
giving them too much sugar.

2073
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,690
You're giving them too much.
Starts scribbling.

2074
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,820
You're giving a grain,
you're giving them something.

2075
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:13,821
Their body doesn't want,
their body wants grass with a cow's 

2076
01:30:13,821 --> 01:30:14,130
body.
Naturally ease is just grass.

2077
01:30:14,131 --> 01:30:19,131
They graze and they just mountains out 
there like towards like San Jose.

2078
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:21,990
We just see them like Jesus.
Go ahead and go,

2079
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,460
you know,
like somewhere nearby,

2080
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:28,470
somewhere shade.
Sometimes they grain finish cow where 

2081
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,640
they'll feed them on grass.
Then before they butcher them,

2082
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,740
they fatten them up with grain.
So his whole life.

2083
01:30:31,741 --> 01:30:34,260
He grazes and then um,
or she grazes.

2084
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:37,590
So he mostly he steers.
You don't eat meat.

2085
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:38,250
Yeah,
you do.

2086
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:43,290
You do steers because I was just going 
to say kind of sticks with those same 

2087
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:43,290
shit.
Yes.

2088
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:45,120
Takes most of the time they're coming 
from mail cows.

2089
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:50,121
They're coming from steers.
The female cows are very valuable for 

2090
01:30:50,121 --> 01:30:50,490
their dairy.
So the male cows,

2091
01:30:50,491 --> 01:30:53,490
they cut their balls off and they turn 
them into steers.

2092
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:54,980
Can't really eat them.
Bull,

2093
01:30:55,030 --> 01:31:00,030
you can eat a bowl,
but good fucking luck will never become 

2094
01:31:00,030 --> 01:31:01,740
a real man.
The steers are all Unix.

2095
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:05,310
Yeah.
Well that's the only way you can control

2096
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:08,230
them.
You can't cook like,

2097
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:13,430
first of all,
good luck thinking that you're going to 

2098
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:15,621
be able to run a profitable business of 
butchering bowls because they're not 

2099
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:20,631
gonna want to let anybody corral them in
anywhere and control them and they're 

2100
01:31:20,631 --> 01:31:24,101
gonna.
They're gonna like you're gonna have to 

2101
01:31:24,101 --> 01:31:25,971
take extra measures to keep them happy.
You can't go out into the yard filled 

2102
01:31:25,971 --> 01:31:26,660
with bowls,
you know,

2103
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,430
instead of it taking extra measures,
we've cut their dick off.

2104
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,600
If I have to cut their balls off,
a lot of this stuff is still probably 

2105
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:34,620
can't be in there with them.
You know,

2106
01:31:34,770 --> 01:31:36,000
they're giant.
Have to have a deck,

2107
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:36,760
right?
You'd have to pee.

2108
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,880
Got To pee,
pee.

2109
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:41,550
It keeps giving them vagina.
No cross dressing.

2110
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:44,820
They eat the balls to.
That's where rocks come from.

2111
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,620
No people.
Cowboys.

2112
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:49,320
Those are watching.
That's what rocky mountain oysters are.

2113
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,990
After they cut off the cows balls,
they,

2114
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:53,670
they cook them up.
It dawned on him.

2115
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,140
Yes.
I had both balls on Israel.

2116
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:57,030
It's not bad,
but a mixed grill.

2117
01:31:57,031 --> 01:31:58,140
Yeah,
it's nice and soft.

2118
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:59,980
Yeah.
I had it once at a m,

2119
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:05,340
one,
a chef cooked like fear factor food and 

2120
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:09,211
that would be delicious.
He prepared it well and so he did it 

2121
01:32:09,211 --> 01:32:10,990
like with a with balls and did it with a
couple of different things.

2122
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:12,850
I want to say that was on opiod Anthony.

2123
01:32:13,210 --> 01:32:14,890
Really?
That they prepared it like that.

2124
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,750
I'm pretty sure it was on opie and 
Anthony.

2125
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:20,020
I can't remember now.
They all become a blur.

2126
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:24,190
Those fear factor interviews,
but a bull's balls tastes like just meet

2127
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:26,800
like I kind of.
Meat doesn't taste bad at all,

2128
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,120
just like liver.
Almost to me.

2129
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,310
Consistency.
Once you chop into it,

2130
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,900
the consistency.
Yeah.

2131
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:35,980
It's a little more mushy than let 
literally like a tenderloin or something

2132
01:32:35,981 --> 01:32:38,590
like that,
but chicken hearts are really good too.

2133
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:40,930
Chicken hearts,
they had some of the trials.

2134
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,760
They have chicken hearts.
Yeah.

2135
01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:45,910
It's someplaces tastes delicious.
Delicious.

2136
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:46,930
It's just really.
They're small.

2137
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:49,420
They're small.
If you've never eaten it,

2138
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:51,910
Fogo de Chao of you don't know what 
we're talking about.

2139
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:55,360
What they are is a Brazilian type of 
steakhouse called the [inaudible] Korea,

2140
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,780
and I just realized that most people 
don't know this because I had explained 

2141
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:00,780
this.

2142
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:01,300
I never knew what it was.
You have a.

2143
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:06,010
it's the Brazilian way of cooking steak.
It's fucking an awesome way to eat.

2144
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:09,490
You have a card in the card,
has a green on one side and a red on the

2145
01:33:09,491 --> 01:33:11,620
other.
Some places it's a fixed salt shaker.

2146
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:12,760
Made out of wood.
Yeah,

2147
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:17,980
turn it upside down with green and red 
and when it's green they keep coming to 

2148
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:21,361
your table and they sliced meat for you 
and you pull it off with tongs and 

2149
01:33:21,361 --> 01:33:21,361
different cuts of meat like,
hey,

2150
01:33:21,361 --> 01:33:23,380
here's some top sirloin.
Would you like it?

2151
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:24,820
Yes or no?
Skewers.

2152
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:29,940
These big giant skewers of just awesome 
looking meat and it's all covered with 

2153
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,100
like,
you know,

2154
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:35,101
they like salted and the basting in in 
its own fat because it's spinning in 

2155
01:33:35,101 --> 01:33:36,790
this,
spinning on a Rotisserie,

2156
01:33:36,791 --> 01:33:41,791
over an open flame and they come by your
table and just slice off chunks of me 

2157
01:33:41,791 --> 01:33:42,610
and God damn.
It's awesome.

2158
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:44,100
And would they give you lamb?

2159
01:33:44,910 --> 01:33:47,920
Small lamb chops,
chicken hearts,

2160
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:49,600
we've probably eaten in.
How many of these?

2161
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
Almost all of them.
They just opened up a window in San 

2162
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:54,780
Diego to write down.
Well,

2163
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:57,010
they used to have a one down there that 
wasn't a Fogo,

2164
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,040
but it was another Brazilian that was 
not a fogo with somewhere in Maryland 

2165
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:03,220
and it was just like,
what the fuck bro?

2166
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:08,550
It's so good.
Just more and more delicious chunks of 

2167
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,550
meat to it.
Not only that,

2168
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:11,200
you get the party started in like five 
minutes right away.

2169
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,640
You don't have to order your food and 
weight up to your waiter.

2170
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:19,130
Yeah.
It just keeps coming and the sidebars 

2171
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,130
and not bad is awesome.
So it was great.

2172
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:23,611
We doing commercials here,
fucking Samsung commercial to get this 

2173
01:34:23,611 --> 01:34:26,320
out to the sides.
Otherwise it meets stage with some beans

2174
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,390
and some,
some Broccoli.

2175
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:31,030
We send in some fiber to open up the 
poop shoot early.

2176
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:35,950
Warm up for the poop poop comes behind 
it.

2177
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:41,010
Have you ever shot at a photo or Jessica
Maria and then gone back to eating a 

2178
01:34:41,010 --> 01:34:41,860
probably.
Who have done that?

2179
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:44,950
Brian created room for yourself.
Last time I went there,

2180
01:34:44,951 --> 01:34:49,951
I actually decided that I was going to 
take it slow instead of going really 

2181
01:34:49,951 --> 01:34:52,300
fast and just eating as much as I spent 
like two,

2182
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,580
two hours.
They're just really just hanging out,

2183
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:57,290
getting to coffee and then going back to
getting me.

2184
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:57,990
Oh,

2185
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,550
like I just.

2186
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,850
You're a nightmare customer.
Wow.

2187
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,500
Was it a sold out night?
No,

2188
01:35:02,501 --> 01:35:04,990
it was just like an afternoon Sunday.
That's cool.

2189
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:10,530
Yeah.
I mean if you're one of those people 

2190
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:10,530
that really wants to take advantage of 
it,

2191
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:10,630
I'm a glutton.
I'm done in 10 minutes,

2192
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,440
10 minutes,
then I could probably quit.

2193
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:17,440
There was one across the street from the
hotel and Cincinnati.

2194
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

2195
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:22,930
Vandelay checking in as we were going 
over there and like midway through,

2196
01:35:22,931 --> 01:35:24,820
like we had just started the meat.
He just jumped in,

2197
01:35:24,821 --> 01:35:27,670
like he put his bags down and went.
I was Brazilians.

2198
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,020
Yeah.
They learn how to eat.

2199
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,110
I also want to stick with the Kanye and 
they.

2200
01:35:32,111 --> 01:35:37,111
I know that they're really special.
Pecan Kanya means yes,

2201
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:39,880
obviously.
Yes.

2202
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:41,500
Give it to me.
You're stingy with it though?

2203
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:43,240
I think.
I think think that costs the most money.

2204
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:48,420
Lamb chops is what they're stingy with.
Where the fuck have the lamb chops all 

2205
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:48,420
the time?
No,

2206
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,520
they're not stingy with anything.
Guys relaxed.

2207
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,910
How come it takes a long time to cook 
this shit?

2208
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,020
A lot of people are eating.
They're not stingy.

2209
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:56,490
It's all this dingy.
It's more than once you.

2210
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:01,740
So Julian it up right now.
The guy that put the little hot dogs 

2211
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:02,890
feel so bad.
He was always running around anybody.

2212
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:06,880
Anybody taking a Goddamn hot it because 
they cook their own meals.

2213
01:36:06,881 --> 01:36:11,470
So he feels like he must be.
He's depressed one of the bunch.

2214
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:13,930
He probably just gets no pussy.
He probably goes home.

2215
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:16,230
It could ask.
Diaz wants it like,

2216
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:16,960
well done.
So will you go?

2217
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:22,180
All right.
I'll make a piece well done for you 

2218
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:23,910
because every time they cut it off,
now I want to talk more real on the 

2219
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,910
inside.
They'll,

2220
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,910
they'll cook that part.
Go back.

2221
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,760
Yeah.
So good.

2222
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:31,030
So good.
It's such an awesome way of cooking 

2223
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,451
food.
They really have got it down to fake 

2224
01:36:33,451 --> 01:36:33,451
after the show.
Oh,

2225
01:36:33,451 --> 01:36:33,510
the street.
Yeah.

2226
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,870
That's pretty good too.
Sure,

2227
01:36:34,871 --> 01:36:36,340
let's do that.
That place is fine.

2228
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,440
I've got no problem with that place.
Yeah,

2229
01:36:38,441 --> 01:36:43,441
that's a great way of ordering meat.
There's a Brazilian steakhouse in the 

2230
01:36:43,441 --> 01:36:47,521
mall.
That's fantastic that you just asked 

2231
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:47,521
them and they just pile it all up on 
your.

2232
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:48,050
Oh yeah,
you're good.

2233
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:50,770
It's not quite the same way.
The joy of just like whatever I can eat.

2234
01:36:51,370 --> 01:36:54,620
It's definitely not quite,
but it's still pretty fucking sporty.

2235
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:55,510
Yeah,
I like it.

2236
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:56,500
Yeah,
they just have that,

2237
01:36:56,501 --> 01:37:01,501
that mall.
But you took me to Brian and the Grove 

2238
01:37:01,501 --> 01:37:04,051
has went to Glendale,
so when you see a big fat piece of 

2239
01:37:04,051 --> 01:37:04,600
marbling on a steak,
it's cooked perfectly.

2240
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:07,720
It's so delicious,
but it's really not a healthy animal.

2241
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:10,930
Oh wait to take us back,
like how did we get here?

2242
01:37:11,310 --> 01:37:13,450
That's where we started after the dots.
I like it.

2243
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:18,000
I had a fucking farmer on last week and 
talked with them for three hours.

2244
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,410
Real farmers,
real farmer.

2245
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:22,870
This Guy Joel Salatin,
he's famous for doing what he calls.

2246
01:37:23,740 --> 01:37:24,630
He calls it,
um,

2247
01:37:24,700 --> 01:37:27,550
integrity,
meat and in integrity farms,

2248
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,020
like the way he runs things,
they,

2249
01:37:29,021 --> 01:37:33,190
the animals live essentially like total 
free range boobs.

2250
01:37:33,191 --> 01:37:38,191
The chickens around.
He has electric fences for the cows and 

2251
01:37:38,191 --> 01:37:40,951
the pigs moves them to different areas 
of the farm unless they just completely 

2252
01:37:40,951 --> 01:37:42,490
roam free and rummage through the woods.
Like he's got.

2253
01:37:42,491 --> 01:37:45,330
Pigs are wild pigs,
but they're there.

2254
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,060
They're domestic pigs rather.
But they behave some wild look like wild

2255
01:37:49,061 --> 01:37:51,340
pigs and a lot of ways,
like they're really fat,

2256
01:37:51,341 --> 01:37:54,670
but the muscles like really defined.
They have a darker tissue.

2257
01:37:54,670 --> 01:37:56,880
They're much animals.
Even about salmon.

2258
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:58,230
Right?
The pink coloring they get,

2259
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:00,210
they get that in the wild.
In captivity.

2260
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:01,830
They just add that shit.
Yeah.

2261
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:06,831
The,
that coloring because we've agreed that 

2262
01:38:06,831 --> 01:38:06,831
salmon should look like,
isn't that weird?

2263
01:38:06,831 --> 01:38:07,620
When you lose the coloring,
man,

2264
01:38:07,621 --> 01:38:09,960
that's something to do with your soul.
Nah.

2265
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,800
Something,
right?

2266
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,540
Yeah.
You did the coloring of it.

2267
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,740
Does it have the same nutrients?
I wonder what it is if it's certain bugs

2268
01:38:16,741 --> 01:38:20,530
that they eat or you know,
certain shellfish or what it.

2269
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:24,120
Let's find out what helps.
What makes a a Sam?

2270
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:26,190
It seems weird that everybody just cool 
with that.

2271
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,250
What would be the right Google thing?
What makes us sam and less pink?

2272
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:32,160
Hot Pink when say they die.
They die.

2273
01:38:32,161 --> 01:38:32,970
The Salmon.
Yeah,

2274
01:38:32,971 --> 01:38:35,370
but in the wild they don't die in the 
wild is just pink.

2275
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:36,400
Yeah.
Really?

2276
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,870
Yeah,
because I think it's like Disney when it

2277
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:41,360
dies,
how old the fishes?

2278
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:42,530
It gets wider,
like at least.

2279
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:44,280
I think it probably loose now as it gets
older.

2280
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,000
No,
no,

2281
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:46,380
no.
It still stays correct.

2282
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:51,430
Yeah.
What happens is there's something that 

2283
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,940
happens.
Okay.

2284
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,320
The amount of height.
Oh,

2285
01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:58,650
it's something about the protein pellets
that they feed them.

2286
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:00,750
Takes away their color.
Yeah.

2287
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:05,990
Wow.
They put the pellets instead of eating 

2288
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,270
other fish.
They would it be other fish?

2289
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:10,770
They would be eating other fish.
They'd be eating all sorts of things.

2290
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:13,350
Man Fishing was so cool.
Yeah.

2291
01:39:13,351 --> 01:39:15,450
They're like,
these are like couch potatoes is what?

2292
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:19,550
How they're describing it,
but they just sit there and eat bon bons

2293
01:39:19,551 --> 01:39:20,240
and you're like,
yeah,

2294
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,980
healthy.
Yeah.

2295
01:39:21,981 --> 01:39:24,950
That they're essentially they're 
consuming.

2296
01:39:24,951 --> 01:39:26,780
This is what it says here in Swat 
article.

2297
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:28,760
They're consuming a tremendous amount of
high,

2298
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,080
highly concentrated protein pellets and 
uh,

2299
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:33,680
they make it terrific mess.

2300
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,020
Oh God.
Apparently like,

2301
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:41,970
like these fish farms are like super bad
for the environment over.

2302
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,000
Really?
Yeah.

2303
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:48,240
Why?
Because they raised a lot of the same 

2304
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:49,120
issues that uh,
other places have.

2305
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:52,390
If you have chickens or cows like fecal 
matter shit.

2306
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:54,100
So you're,
you know,

2307
01:39:54,101 --> 01:39:58,870
you have like a gigantic pool of the 
fish just shitting on each other.

2308
01:39:58,871 --> 01:40:01,270
Yeah.
Shitting and pissing each other's faces.

2309
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,320
Oh,
I'm the drain it buried somewhere and 

2310
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,191
then they're like,
floating pig farms says this one guy 

2311
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:11,311
who's a professor,
fisheries at the University of British 

2312
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:14,160
Columbia,
they consume a tremendous amount of 

2313
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:14,160
these things,
these pellets.

2314
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,730
And then they just piss and shit in 
there.

2315
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,370
That's it.
You don't even think about that.

2316
01:40:19,371 --> 01:40:22,700
But disease and parasites,
which would normally exist in relatively

2317
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:27,701
low levels in fish,
scattered around the oceans can run 

2318
01:40:27,701 --> 01:40:29,020
rampant and densely packed.
Fish farms is all there.

2319
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:32,180
The bugs shit and everything happens.
I don't even know if that happens.

2320
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:37,250
I get that show.
Nine hundred 70 pound tuna fish found is

2321
01:40:37,251 --> 01:40:39,640
almost $2,000,000.
Oh,

2322
01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:46,190
that's chicken of the sea.
Those things that's worth $2,000,000.

2323
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:48,170
That's what they're saying.
Going to Tunis store.

2324
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,000
Yeah.
Probably the five chefs in Japan.

2325
01:40:50,001 --> 01:40:51,110
Right?
Oh my God.

2326
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:52,760
That thing is so big.
Pull of that picture.

2327
01:40:52,761 --> 01:40:56,140
Again,
that is just holding a fish,

2328
01:40:56,141 --> 01:40:59,110
but that was just the fin.
I would love to see the perspective.

2329
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:02,250
I'd love to see a better angle that 
doesn't in any pictures.

2330
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:04,690
Doesn't come forward.
It's not flattened out like that.

2331
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:06,910
It's hard to.
I mean it looks obviously like a house,

2332
01:41:06,911 --> 01:41:10,060
but God not at seven pounds.
That's insane.

2333
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:12,040
That is fucking insane,
man.

2334
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,930
In New Zealand going to China.

2335
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:18,830
You go to China,
right?

2336
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:19,780
Yeah.
Wow.

2337
01:41:19,810 --> 01:41:22,150
Just to fuck around a tour.
That's pretty cool.

2338
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,190
It is pretty cool.
Yeah.

2339
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,480
Is there a common.
I mean,

2340
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:28,510
can they have.
They have Australians and English people

2341
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:29,980
and other English speakers that are just
there.

2342
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:33,070
So they just put on bar shows.
You going with Schubert?

2343
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,760
No,
she was gone that tour though.

2344
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:35,890
But uh,
no.

2345
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:37,360
It's just a run.
Okay.

2346
01:41:37,361 --> 01:41:38,590
Here's what it,
what it is.

2347
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:40,660
Salmon.
I've found out the actual answer,

2348
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:45,010
the actual cover of salmon flesh varies 
from an almost white to a deep pink,

2349
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:49,570
depending on the levels of carotenoid 
asked,

2350
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:55,730
asked to Aksia thin what has a t,
a x a n,

2351
01:41:55,991 --> 01:42:00,991
t,
h I n whatever the fuck that is due to 

2352
01:42:00,991 --> 01:42:03,900
how Jennifer Aniston instance as ass tax
a tax anthon due to a rich diet of Krill

2353
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:15,270
and shrimp.
So depending on how rich their diet is 

2354
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:17,860
of true of shrimp,
they'll get darker,

2355
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:23,220
but we associated with being being 
healthy or color of the thing they're 

2356
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:23,220
eating.

2357
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:27,900
Exactly.
And Salmon raised on fish farms are 

2358
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:28,640
given artificial coloring in their food.
Like if you.

2359
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:30,190
Oh really?
Yeah.

2360
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:35,230
That's even more fucked.
So it gets into their meat that's even 

2361
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:37,921
more fucked up.
The pellets of artificial in pink dies 

2362
01:42:37,921 --> 01:42:40,720
their skin brown yesterday.
Well apparently people want us pink.

2363
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,520
So now we're even pink.
How weird.

2364
01:42:42,550 --> 01:42:44,920
Your eating pink food.
Like green eggs and ham.

2365
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:47,290
Yeah,
but pink does that a real thing?

2366
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:49,060
If you eat carrots all day long,
you'll turn orange.

2367
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,010
Yes.
Andy Dick turned orange.

2368
01:42:51,011 --> 01:42:51,720
You did it?
Yeah.

2369
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:53,980
How long have you do it for?
Didn't eat carrots all day.

2370
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:54,820
He,
uh,

2371
01:42:55,060 --> 01:43:00,060
Andy,
believe it or not is kind of like a 

2372
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:00,060
supplement nut.
They always had like a,

2373
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:02,060
like a box.
Boys are not a supplement of.

2374
01:43:05,110 --> 01:43:07,810
He always had a box of vitamins that he 
would,

2375
01:43:07,811 --> 01:43:12,811
uh,
take everyday and he would drink like 

2376
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:12,811
these fruit drinks,
juice drinks,

2377
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:14,470
and he would drink carrot juice,
carrot juicing.

2378
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:17,050
So much that he actually got like an 
orange hue to them.

2379
01:43:17,051 --> 01:43:18,160
Wow.
Yeah.

2380
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:20,140
Andy Dick being orange.
Yeah,

2381
01:43:20,141 --> 01:43:21,430
it was,
it was a very odd.

2382
01:43:21,431 --> 01:43:24,940
It's a Mitzi to call a sinbad's orange 
is orange.

2383
01:43:24,941 --> 01:43:26,740
Look at um,
he's not black.

2384
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:28,720
He's rng.
Oh my God.

2385
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:29,620
You know,
that's.

2386
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,470
I totally shocked with that.
You can get a little bit of a coach.

2387
01:43:33,471 --> 01:43:34,530
You remember that dude who,
uh,

2388
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,730
eight was that,
that silver stuff.

2389
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:41,760
Silver.
He drank some silver solution and turn 

2390
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,000
blue permanently blue.
Really?

2391
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:44,440
Yeah.
He never seen that.

2392
01:43:44,441 --> 01:43:49,441
Yeah.
If I know you've seen violet beauregard 

2393
01:43:49,441 --> 01:43:49,441
pull,
pull it up.

2394
01:43:49,441 --> 01:43:51,010
Man's skin turns blue.
Was it blue?

2395
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:51,740
Like silver

2396
01:43:52,210 --> 01:43:54,770
blue port.
Fuck wow.

2397
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:57,260
Yeah,
he was a like colloidal silver.

2398
01:43:57,290 --> 01:44:02,290
COLLOIDAL silver.
It's like one of those things where you 

2399
01:44:02,290 --> 01:44:04,151
like you,
you like a lot of people got into this 

2400
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:06,140
thing with colloidal silver and curing 
colds and like,

2401
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:08,180
yeah,
this is the guy.

2402
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:10,080
Whoa.

2403
01:44:10,140 --> 01:44:11,880
Yup.
That's just what it looks like.

2404
01:44:11,881 --> 01:44:13,590
Yeah.
This is real skin color forever.

2405
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:15,030
Forever get mail.

2406
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,180
Wow.

2407
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:18,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2408
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:22,390
And it stuck that way and I don't think 
they ever figured out how to get it off.

2409
01:44:22,391 --> 01:44:27,391
I'm either and so he just makes his 
living going on talk shows and showing 

2410
01:44:27,391 --> 01:44:29,590
off his freak skin.
How dare you do industry.

2411
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:33,670
This is just him educating the world are
a why you have to be so cynical.

2412
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:39,470
He's got a profit.
How's he profits on a set somewhere 

2413
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:44,120
while looking at him,
I said maybe this is what his house is 

2414
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:45,640
decorated like you're really into modern
shit and Mike's on his lapel.

2415
01:44:45,670 --> 01:44:50,470
I would dye my hair pink or something 
like bright red hair.

2416
01:44:50,471 --> 01:44:51,320
The.
Oh yeah.

2417
01:44:51,321 --> 01:44:56,321
The pink and Blue Combo.
Can Blue lanyards for a checksum camp?

2418
01:44:57,401 --> 01:44:58,750
Put Pink and blue.
A landlord.

2419
01:44:59,230 --> 01:45:01,990
I think people would probably,
for the oddity of it all,

2420
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:07,530
I'm sure,
but he's probably already married to 

2421
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:09,601
now.
The girls like we're going to stick it 

2422
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:10,681
out,
but I'm less attractive than it was 

2423
01:45:10,681 --> 01:45:10,681
before court guy.

2424
01:45:10,681 --> 01:45:10,720
I wouldn't mind it.
I don't think that's bad.

2425
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,790
You wouldn't mind that.
That was a girl started taking colloidal

2426
01:45:12,791 --> 01:45:15,040
silver sun.
If it was a chick that had purposed,

2427
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,970
I think it would be bad as I'd make her 
have pink hair be sweet.

2428
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,710
You would like to check that looks like 
she's made out of metal.

2429
01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:22,990
It should be unique.
It would be unique,

2430
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:24,730
you know,
like look like I'll be dating an alien.

2431
01:45:24,731 --> 01:45:29,731
I just make sure that she had the right 
color hair and she did the record with 

2432
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:29,731
like,
you know.

2433
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:33,430
Cool.
How would you make sure that she would 

2434
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,430
do that?
I would style her out.

2435
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:33,810
What if she was like,
I want to go green today at the hair.

2436
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:35,560
Go now listen to me,
bitch.

2437
01:45:35,590 --> 01:45:37,210
You are me.
You are nuts.

2438
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:39,580
You're imparting to me when I'm out.
You represent.

2439
01:45:39,581 --> 01:45:40,660
Represent me.
Oh,

2440
01:45:40,690 --> 01:45:43,420
some bitch with glue skin,
green hair.

2441
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:48,460
Your pink hair.
Where the fucking alien close just 

2442
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:48,460
wearing a fucking alien clothes.
Okay.

2443
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:53,290
We bought them for a reason where the 
alien close.

2444
01:45:54,930 --> 01:45:56,000
I see it.
Check with this.

2445
01:45:56,050 --> 01:45:57,430
Oh my goodness.
Look at that.

2446
01:45:57,431 --> 01:45:59,290
That's kind of girl.
Looks like that.

2447
01:46:02,020 --> 01:46:04,390
So excited.
He found a girl.

2448
01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:07,600
By the way,
my next storyteller shows on Tuesday,

2449
01:46:07,630 --> 01:46:09,010
April eighth.
Get the fuck out of here.

2450
01:46:09,011 --> 01:46:11,070
How's that possible?
We're not recording it.

2451
01:46:11,071 --> 01:46:12,460
It's just a live one.
Who's doing it?

2452
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,190
Diaz.
Matt Bronner.

2453
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:16,000
Good.
Emily Heller.

2454
01:46:16,030 --> 01:46:17,500
Rob Delaney.
Good God.

2455
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:20,770
Good God,
that sounds awesome.

2456
01:46:20,850 --> 01:46:21,760
Tuesday,
Tuesday.

2457
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:25,120
The all stories about role models.
Oh Wow.

2458
01:46:25,210 --> 01:46:27,300
What is that?
That's when a girl that had this.

2459
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:29,740
She just looked like bad lighting.
Yeah.

2460
01:46:29,741 --> 01:46:32,450
She looks normal.
Mother Pearl kind of issue.

2461
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:33,990
It is.
I can't tell what the light.

2462
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,010
What does it say?
What does this story say about her?

2463
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:37,190
Uh,

2464
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:43,840
see a woman has turned silver.
Warren's it's hard to tell him that.

2465
01:46:43,841 --> 01:46:45,610
Hard to tell because it will be dim 
lighting.

2466
01:46:45,660 --> 01:46:49,530
So it was a tough color to pick up our 
internet medicines.

2467
01:46:49,740 --> 01:46:50,430
Oh Great.

2468
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,860
Joe,
you recommended me to get sober.

2469
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:54,630
Colloidal is the same shit.
Yeah.

2470
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:59,631
After she took nose drops for years 
warning people to stay medicines 

2471
01:46:59,631 --> 01:47:00,420
containing the metal from nosedive

2472
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:02,270
and this from colloidal silver.
Yeah,

2473
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:03,200
same shit.
Yeah.

2474
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:06,090
Oh,
and the FDA approves it.

2475
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:07,230
They still like,
okay with that.

2476
01:47:07,231 --> 01:47:11,250
I don't know about that.
Do they have a half to approve colloidal

2477
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:12,690
silver?
I don't think they have to approve it.

2478
01:47:12,770 --> 01:47:14,310
If it's an APP,
it's a nose drops.

2479
01:47:14,410 --> 01:47:19,410
What is that silver that that.
That one week Dr gave us that one time 

2480
01:47:19,410 --> 01:47:19,580
that was like you looked at it looks 
silver and he's like,

2481
01:47:19,581 --> 01:47:20,890
Oh yeah,
just spray it in your mouth.

2482
01:47:20,891 --> 01:47:21,580
Was that the shit?

2483
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,310
No,
no.

2484
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:24,510
I know what you're talking about will 
have.

2485
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,430
It wasn't that way would that is in this
guys.

2486
01:47:29,460 --> 01:47:34,460
God is totally the colloidal silver.
You'll actually make it like he put the 

2487
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:39,090
silver pieces.
You put it in like water and you add 

2488
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:40,170
some sort of electric current used to do
it.

2489
01:47:40,171 --> 01:47:42,270
My friend Demetrius take chloral silver.
Yeah.

2490
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,950
They used to believe in him.
If he got sick.

2491
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:49,760
My friend Pete,
a smoked a gold blunt wrappers are 

2492
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:50,020
selling gold blunts.
Actual gold.

2493
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,000
Gold is the weirdest thing ever.
A lot of people don't realize,

2494
01:47:54,190 --> 01:47:57,180
so it was a very smooth.
You can take a piece of gold,

2495
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:00,600
like a little tiny piece of goal and you
can cover something as big as this whole

2496
01:48:00,601 --> 01:48:05,601
desk with it,
which because it could be so malleable 

2497
01:48:05,601 --> 01:48:05,601
to so thin,
it gets so thin.

2498
01:48:05,601 --> 01:48:06,420
It has really bizarre properties.

2499
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:09,960
Almost alien like properties because 
there's no other metal that exhibits the

2500
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:14,961
same as the old alien spaceships.
The goldmines I'm told or it was where 

2501
01:48:15,901 --> 01:48:18,740
the old alien spaceships ones of the 
earth and just created this.

2502
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:21,210
I don't think so.
I think it's just an unusual mineral.

2503
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:26,400
Okay.
I mean we know it's a similar to a lot 

2504
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:27,780
of other ones.
It just has an incredible property,

2505
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:30,120
like the ability to spread and coat 
things.

2506
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:31,870
Good conductor to.
Cool.

2507
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,610
Well that's her blue check.
No,

2508
01:48:33,620 --> 01:48:34,210
that's,
that's,

2509
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:39,500
that's fake.
But I do like to pink and blue hair 

2510
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:39,500
though.
I see what you're saying though.

2511
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:39,500
Brian.
We lived in.

2512
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,890
The lights were off.
If that wouldn't be a problem at all.

2513
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:46,070
Getting tattoos though and getting those
big hoop earrings and fucking their 

2514
01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:46,310
faces up anyway.
Why don't they just drink the silver and

2515
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:48,710
blue skin?
That'd be pretty cool to be a unique.

2516
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,160
Different.

2517
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,620
Definitely easier than getting your 
whole body tattooed,

2518
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:55,350
so it was for a little while.
If you get it for a year or something,

2519
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:56,930
you know people.

2520
01:48:56,970 --> 01:49:01,970
What's.
The tattoos are forever and these girls 

2521
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:01,970
are getting face tattoos.
I say Walmart on it

2522
01:49:01,970 --> 01:49:05,970
just forever.
No one's getting face tattoos and say 

2523
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:08,381
Walmart and Walmart.
These people say no one really looked it

2524
01:49:11,271 --> 01:49:11,810
up.
Oh,

2525
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,880
I would love that woman who at a 
gambling casino tattooed on her 

2526
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:20,940
forehead.
Just gambling casino or the name of this

2527
01:49:21,070 --> 01:49:24,620
Golden Palace.com.
Remember that she had it tattooed on her

2528
01:49:24,621 --> 01:49:25,940
forehead.
They gave her a certain amount of money.

2529
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:28,040
Yeah,
I think it was one of those things where

2530
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:31,580
anybody who's willing to get it tattooed
on their head get like extra money.

2531
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:33,290
Wow.
They used to put it on fighters.

2532
01:49:33,291 --> 01:49:35,240
Backs member.
There's tattooed on.

2533
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:36,530
Yeah,
the Henna.

2534
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:41,860
They used to use to use like a magic 
marker and it would draw it on people's 

2535
01:49:41,860 --> 01:49:45,041
backs.
Do you remember know whether you'd use 

2536
01:49:45,041 --> 01:49:45,041
body paint or something like that?
On the fighters,

2537
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,930
they did it with MMA fighters,
like uh,

2538
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:48,220
one

2539
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,550
of the guys a Rico Rodriguez.
He did it to him before he fought in the

2540
01:49:51,551 --> 01:49:56,330
UFC and he got in trouble for it because
it was looking at this Walmart,

2541
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,820
Walmart.
Wow.

2542
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,030
So they're going to go for it could 
joke.

2543
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:07,270
I like it as Walmart tattooed on his 
kind of like ears.

2544
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,520
Ari Is that real though?
Really?

2545
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:16,580
It's pretty good.
Photos off is not the way the girl is a 

2546
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:17,180
probably a hipster.
Yeah.

2547
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:19,720
What'd you,
when you say stretch marks on her side,

2548
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:24,721
but still in shape.
I don't know how you got to have those 

2549
01:50:24,721 --> 01:50:25,930
go off.
Fall off.

2550
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:28,330
Fall off the wagon.
That's what it is.

2551
01:50:28,660 --> 01:50:30,820
Do you worry about letting your kids 
watch certain things on TV?

2552
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:31,960
Like what?
I don't know.

2553
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:37,470
I mean I,
you want them to watch too much 

2554
01:50:37,470 --> 01:50:39,241
violence,
but they've walked in during the UFC 

2555
01:50:39,241 --> 01:50:41,431
fight before and sat down to cuddle with
me and that real confused as to what's 

2556
01:50:41,431 --> 01:50:41,431
going on.

2557
01:50:41,431 --> 01:50:46,010
Like one guy was getting fucked up and 
there was blood pouring down his head 

2558
01:50:46,010 --> 01:50:47,830
and I had to decide like how to react to
this when she's watching this,

2559
01:50:47,831 --> 01:50:49,210
they're trying to be like.
And she's like,

2560
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:51,640
why is there all this cut?
Why is all this blood?

2561
01:50:51,641 --> 01:50:52,240
I go,
oh honey,

2562
01:50:52,241 --> 01:50:53,980
he got hit.
He got hit.

2563
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:54,970
Why did he get hit?
I go,

2564
01:50:54,971 --> 01:50:55,960
well,
this is a fight.

2565
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:58,870
And sometimes when you're fighting you 
get hit.

2566
01:50:58,871 --> 01:50:59,980
Is he hurt?
Yes,

2567
01:51:00,010 --> 01:51:02,290
he's done,
but he's going to be okay.

2568
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:03,520
He's going to be okay.
Yeah,

2569
01:51:03,521 --> 01:51:05,620
he's going to be okay.
But why did he get hurt?

2570
01:51:05,800 --> 01:51:10,800
He got hurt because he's doing mma.
What's MMA and amaze the UFC was the 

2571
01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:15,631
UFC.
UFC is mixed martial arts and you know 

2572
01:51:15,631 --> 01:51:15,631
like,
hey listen,

2573
01:51:15,631 --> 01:51:19,771
we can't have these conversations 
because I want to watch going on and 

2574
01:51:19,771 --> 01:51:20,050
it's already an exciting morning.
It's important shit.

2575
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,890
But it was a,
you know,

2576
01:51:21,930 --> 01:51:23,020
was awesome.
Mommy,

2577
01:51:23,110 --> 01:51:26,510
go talk to mommy on it,
baby.

2578
01:51:28,660 --> 01:51:33,660
What happened was I was watching it and 
they weren't home and so when they came 

2579
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:33,660
home they ran into the room,
why?

2580
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:38,400
Why not?
And I didn't shut it off and it was 

2581
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:41,401
already in the middle of a fight,
so it was one of those things where I 

2582
01:51:41,401 --> 01:51:41,401
was like,
yeah,

2583
01:51:41,401 --> 01:51:41,740
you guys probably shouldn't be watching 
this.

2584
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,650
But they didn't freak out.
Go ahead,

2585
01:51:44,030 --> 01:51:47,260
get your ppe on dancing.
They didn't freak out.

2586
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:48,160
That's cool.
They didn't freak out.

2587
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,960
They didn't.
They've never freaked out when they saw 

2588
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:55,681
hunting shows either.
And it hasn't taken anything away from 

2589
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:55,681
them.
I don't think.

2590
01:51:55,681 --> 01:51:57,220
I don't,
I don't want to expose them to any,

2591
01:51:57,580 --> 01:52:00,220
uh,
any real violence though,

2592
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:04,420
you know,
even even mma is probably too much for a

2593
01:52:04,421 --> 01:52:08,200
five year old kid to say walk in and see
a guy getting ground and pounded.

2594
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,700
It's just something like,
I don't want that.

2595
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:12,870
Do you want them to get into mma when 
they grow older?

2596
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:15,450
Would you like them to get into Jujitsu 
and all that stuff?

2597
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:19,390
I think that people should do what they 
want to do.

2598
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:24,480
And I think if that's something that 
becomes something that they think is 

2599
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:28,021
exciting,
if they think that a nma looks like it 

2600
01:52:28,021 --> 01:52:28,021
will be fun or Jujitsu looks like it'd 
be fun.

2601
01:52:28,021 --> 01:52:28,960
And then,
yeah,

2602
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:30,280
they should do it,
but they don't.

2603
01:52:30,281 --> 01:52:32,230
And they think that something else looks
fun.

2604
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:33,610
They should do that too.
I mean,

2605
01:52:33,611 --> 01:52:34,840
I,
I teach them things.

2606
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:36,370
I've already started teaching them.

2607
01:52:36,510 --> 01:52:41,510
I think it must be hard for a girl to do
something like Jujitsu because I know 

2608
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:42,720
talking to a couple girls I know,
didn't you just so that they're like,

2609
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,890
yeah,
you run into the guys to have the boners

2610
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:45,690
they're,
you think they're,

2611
01:52:45,691 --> 01:52:46,310
they're just

2612
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:49,250
like trying to grind their dicks on you 
and stuff like that.

2613
01:52:49,570 --> 01:52:54,570
There's was going to be done.
It's way harder for a chick to finish 

2614
01:52:54,570 --> 01:52:55,180
for a guy.
It's way harder for them,

2615
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:58,250
girl to find good training partners.
Too much less,

2616
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:00,510
um,
less women do it.

2617
01:53:00,660 --> 01:53:04,320
So a woman who like grinds it out and 
becomes purple belt,

2618
01:53:04,590 --> 01:53:05,910
Brown belt,
black belt,

2619
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,400
like those women are bad ass man.
That takes,

2620
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:13,680
you've got to be a special type of chick
to gut it out and become like a Jujitsu 

2621
01:53:13,680 --> 01:53:14,040
brown belt,
Jujitsu,

2622
01:53:14,041 --> 01:53:15,170
black belt,
you know,

2623
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,100
to become like a real world class.
Like Rhonda Rousey type Black Belt,

2624
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,910
you know,
she's a judo black belt,

2625
01:53:20,911 --> 01:53:23,760
but you know,
same sort of thing to get to that level,

2626
01:53:23,761 --> 01:53:25,650
man,
you got to be something really special.

2627
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,800
You really do.
You've got to have something that just 

2628
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,631
pushes you past everybody else.
Like when you see women and women that 

2629
01:53:32,631 --> 01:53:34,170
fight in the UFC and they have a jujitsu
black belts,

2630
01:53:34,171 --> 01:53:38,580
like God damn woman that has a Jujitsu.
Black belt is a rare thing.

2631
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:43,530
It was a bunch of them now,
but still much more rare than male black

2632
01:53:43,531 --> 01:53:45,300
belts.
Male black belts are everywhere.

2633
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:46,980
I mean,
I don't know what the numbers are,

2634
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:50,800
but I'd have to say it's gotta be like 
10 to one or something like that.

2635
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:53,410
I mean,
I don't know,

2636
01:53:53,411 --> 01:53:56,400
I'm just,
I might be totally incorrect,

2637
01:53:56,401 --> 01:54:01,401
but I would,
I would expect it would be somewhere 

2638
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:03,040
around that.
I don't think he does know.

2639
01:54:03,560 --> 01:54:06,120
Um,
but there's a,

2640
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:07,860
there's some legit ones out there,
man.

2641
01:54:07,861 --> 01:54:09,420
I'll tell you that.
That's for fucking sure.

2642
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,730
How many of them are lesbians?
I don't know.

2643
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:13,440
Why don't you ask them Dude,
whip your dick out.

2644
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:21,650
That's what it was like a crazy thing.
It's like a girl saw guys,

2645
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:27,480
Dick,
like literally nature had made it so 

2646
01:54:27,480 --> 01:54:27,970
that all you have to do is show someone 
your deck.

2647
01:54:27,971 --> 01:54:29,290
Like as soon as we started covering it 
up,

2648
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,080
nature made it so that if you have a guy
pulls his dick out,

2649
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:34,960
like there could be like a room full of 
women.

2650
01:54:34,961 --> 01:54:39,961
They all dropped their needs.
Just start talking at like nature just 

2651
01:54:39,961 --> 01:54:43,321
confused the shit out of you and so it 
becomes illegal to whip your dick out 

2652
01:54:43,321 --> 01:54:43,880
because it's like it's breaking the 
rule.

2653
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:49,350
It's like they would have no choice.
I can't imagine how crazy society just 

2654
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:53,020
catch people sucking people off for no 
reason.

2655
01:54:53,021 --> 01:54:55,090
Like what are you doing?
He pulled it out.

2656
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:56,400
Asshole.
Don't pull.

2657
01:54:56,401 --> 01:54:58,570
You're to start with.
You pull it out.

2658
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,790
I wanted to give them a textbook.

2659
01:55:00,550 --> 01:55:05,550
I know,
but there's a reason we have laws that 

2660
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:05,550
would be the last people who lock people
out for Pomona,

2661
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:08,050
Dick out in front of other people lives 
plain about it.

2662
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:10,480
Why we stopped.
That's our natural.

2663
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:12,300
It sounds ridiculous,
but sodas,

2664
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:15,730
like almost all the weird shit like 
having to go to sleep.

2665
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:20,790
That sounds ridiculous,
that every night you have to close your 

2666
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:23,320
eyes and the thing stops and it goes 
into some crazy land where your eyes are

2667
01:55:23,321 --> 01:55:28,120
moving around back and forth inside your
head and you're fucking pastoral flying.

2668
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:33,270
That's just way weirder than you pull 
your dick out and people just start 

2669
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:33,270
socking it.
Right?

2670
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:38,080
It's a real thing.
You're downloading some shit.

2671
01:55:38,650 --> 01:55:39,460
Well,
you're tripping.

2672
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:42,130
That's what you're doing.
You're tripping your balls off.

2673
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,130
I balls back forth.
They're pretty

2674
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,070
sure that what's going on in.
It's hard to measure it,

2675
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:52,310
but they're pretty sure what's going on 
is dimethyltryptamine that there's a 

2676
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:53,880
release some form when you wake up and 
goes out real quick.

2677
01:55:53,881 --> 01:55:55,320
It just like,
okay,

2678
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:58,230
I'm fine.
They know now that a rat's produce it in

2679
01:55:58,231 --> 01:56:03,231
their brains while they're alive.
The pineal gland of the rat's brain 

2680
01:56:03,231 --> 01:56:06,411
producers this dimethyltryptamine and 
they're pretty sure that it produces it 

2681
01:56:06,411 --> 01:56:08,910
in high doses during periods of stress 
or during,

2682
01:56:09,020 --> 01:56:10,860
um,
during rem sleep.

2683
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:14,730
Extreme stress where you think body 
thinks it's going to die in Rem sleep or

2684
01:56:14,731 --> 01:56:19,410
two times where it just floods you with 
it and they don't know how to measure it

2685
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:22,230
in the dream state.
Like how to get reps,

2686
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:24,990
trying to work on figuring out how to 
measure that.

2687
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,160
Because to measure it,
it's,

2688
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:32,290
it's really difficult to run these kinds
of studies because it's a schedule one 

2689
01:56:32,290 --> 01:56:36,801
drug,
but it's also something that your body 

2690
01:56:36,801 --> 01:56:36,801
produces.
It's real weird.

2691
01:56:36,801 --> 01:56:37,020
So you're,
you're,

2692
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:40,920
you're monitoring schedule one drugs and
their appearance in the body.

2693
01:56:40,940 --> 01:56:43,650
What testosterone in your body,
but they ready to register.

2694
01:56:43,860 --> 01:56:44,910
Regulate that too,
right?

2695
01:56:45,390 --> 01:56:47,990
That's true.
But texts testosterone,

2696
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,730
illegal.
Yeah.

2697
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:53,580
It's not illegal.
You can get it prescribed what the issue

2698
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:58,581
is with a dimethyltryptamine is that so 
prevalent on I got to do it at some 

2699
01:56:58,581 --> 01:57:00,810
point you do.
It's so goddamn prevalent.

2700
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:06,170
You've never done it,
Brent or you have not done it and you 

2701
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:06,170
don't think I should do it.
Why not?

2702
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:06,660
Don't listen to him ever

2703
01:57:07,010 --> 01:57:07,540
personal.
Uh,

2704
01:57:07,850 --> 01:57:10,890
he didn't like the Salvia thing.
I love the Salvia thing.

2705
01:57:10,950 --> 01:57:12,510
I keep saying,
I love that.

2706
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:14,790
It just looked weird,
so mad at me.

2707
01:57:15,760 --> 01:57:20,760
Well,
you were fucking with him while he was 

2708
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:20,760
tripping.
Watched it.

2709
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,730
What were you doing?
You were just being totally silent.

2710
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:24,960
No.
Was.

2711
01:57:25,030 --> 01:57:30,030
I was hosting a podcast and then trying 
to get some stuff out of it and,

2712
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,140
and I didn't know he was that fucked up.
I was just like having fun.

2713
01:57:34,141 --> 01:57:36,060
But then once I noticed it he was really
fucked up.

2714
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:41,090
Then I tried to make him not stand up.
You're already the devil so you fucking 

2715
01:57:41,090 --> 01:57:42,630
with him until you realize he was fucked
up.

2716
01:57:42,660 --> 01:57:43,890
We stopped fucking.
Yeah,

2717
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:48,891
exactly.
We were doing a podcast was when you 

2718
01:57:48,891 --> 01:57:50,451
come out of that thing,
it looks like you're better on your 

2719
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:50,451
back.
Like when see,

2720
01:57:50,451 --> 01:57:54,430
I think see hung did it or somebody did 
it first once I'm Asian guy and it was 

2721
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:54,430
like.

2722
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:55,500
And then he came and he's back.
He's like,

2723
01:57:55,501 --> 01:58:00,501
oh well how was that?
And he's still like square and not 

2724
01:58:00,501 --> 01:58:04,140
totally back at all.
You're just not like gone.

2725
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:09,200
Salvia is a tricky one man.
It's tricky that it escaped all the 

2726
01:58:09,200 --> 01:58:11,760
regulations.
So you need a spotter to do dmt.

2727
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:13,670
He should have.
It should have one.

2728
01:58:14,010 --> 01:58:15,930
You should have said what?
Because as you like the pipe,

2729
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:18,420
I know a lot of people who have done it 
without a spotter.

2730
01:58:18,450 --> 01:58:18,830
Yeah.
What do you mean?

2731
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:20,660
This is the lender.
The lender will go off once you.

2732
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:22,860
You're in this world.
What if he's like,

2733
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:27,950
stand up and it knocked something over 
and you're gonna be on the ground in la 

2734
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:28,050
La.
Land as a candle.

2735
01:58:28,051 --> 01:58:32,640
NARCS over and you don't have candles.
Do it on the floor.

2736
01:58:32,641 --> 01:58:34,320
Ready?
Write you a check.

2737
01:58:34,321 --> 01:58:35,490
No,
the ones with the candles.

2738
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,080
Candle.
Listen,

2739
01:58:37,081 --> 01:58:42,081
if I go over dude's house and he knows 
I'm coming over and he likes a bunch of 

2740
01:58:42,081 --> 01:58:42,280
candles,
I get my fucking my guard

2741
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,200
up.
That makes it smell better.

2742
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:47,320
It also makes it gay or I'm not saying 
there's anything wrong with that,

2743
01:58:47,321 --> 01:58:49,480
but when everyone's clear on each 
other's intention.

2744
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:52,180
I love lighting.
Trying to give me a massage.

2745
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:53,350
Look really tense.
Hey,

2746
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:58,200
what's going on with the candles 
scented?

2747
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:04,060
I make them crushed my own roses.
I make my own candles.

2748
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:08,020
I lovingly put them together and I would
like you to have to keep it by your bed.

2749
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,680
Yeah.
There's something about candles,

2750
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:13,100
so don't have the candles.
If you're gonna,

2751
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:14,870
do DMT by yourself.
You don't want to let your house.

2752
01:59:14,871 --> 01:59:17,490
I'm just have a spotter for sure.
If you can have a spotter house.

2753
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,780
Barbara spotters getting away.
Sometimes it's like,

2754
01:59:19,781 --> 01:59:24,781
well,
I need to do this and then you got to 

2755
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:24,781
have some for them to.
Well,

2756
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:24,781
not only that,
sometimes they like interrupt.

2757
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:27,520
I'd want to be alone and just have my 
experience completely.

2758
01:59:27,521 --> 01:59:31,000
Eddie Bravo starts snoring.
He fucked up my trip.

2759
01:59:31,001 --> 01:59:32,820
I was on.
He was right beside him.

2760
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:35,620
He was snoring.
I heard him snoring and I had to wake up

2761
01:59:35,621 --> 01:59:36,670
in the middle of the trip.
Go Eddie,

2762
01:59:36,671 --> 01:59:38,450
wake up.
You're fucking snoring.

2763
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,140
He was spotting or he was doing.
He's supposed to be.

2764
01:59:41,770 --> 01:59:43,750
He just took a nap.
It was like you were gone for so long.

2765
01:59:43,751 --> 01:59:44,220
I'm like,
what?

2766
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:46,060
Said it's a 10 minute trip.
It is.

2767
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,620
He took a nap,
take a nap.

2768
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:49,120
He couldn't wait.

2769
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:52,850
If you have any existing schizophrenia 
or anything like that,

2770
01:59:52,851 --> 01:59:54,480
you might break your head open.
You might just.

2771
01:59:55,830 --> 02:00:00,150
That is the thing you struggle with an 
ordinary reality you might not even know

2772
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:00,900
about.
Yeah.

2773
02:00:00,901 --> 02:00:02,340
You might not even.
Well,

2774
02:00:02,341 --> 02:00:05,040
there's a lot of people that are in 
denial about their own mental illness,

2775
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:07,620
but there are a lot of people that don't
know about it yet.

2776
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,390
That's the only weird thing with those 
things.

2777
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:11,310
The people who would like suddenly it's 
like boom,

2778
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,950
you're turned wolf.
Yeah.

2779
02:00:13,951 --> 02:00:18,951
I wonder if that would have happened 
anyway because people just become 

2780
02:00:18,951 --> 02:00:18,951
schizophrenia.
You know?

2781
02:00:18,951 --> 02:00:23,330
It's possible.
I don't know what the chain of events 

2782
02:00:23,330 --> 02:00:23,940
that have to take place in order for 
someone to go loony,

2783
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:29,120
but I know that it's happened with and 
without drugs and I don't know 

2784
02:00:29,120 --> 02:00:30,510
necessarily the drug's fault.
There's with some folks.

2785
02:00:30,511 --> 02:00:35,511
It could be though.
Some folks have had a pretty hair 

2786
02:00:35,511 --> 02:00:39,291
raising stories of not coming back 
entirely and folks that they knew that 

2787
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:41,880
it didn't come back entirely.
How setting off a schizophrenia episode.

2788
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:43,230
Yeah.
I've known a few people.

2789
02:00:44,380 --> 02:00:44,690
Well,
yeah.

2790
02:00:45,580 --> 02:00:46,590
People that are vulnerable

2791
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:47,720
never came back from.
No,

2792
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:49,000
she never came back.
Dude.

2793
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:51,070
I knew this one guy and don't want to 
say it in college.

2794
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:56,140
He used to just be the guy that would 
always take 10 heads instead of a one 

2795
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,140
hit.
You're like,

2796
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:56,140
dude,
just take one.

2797
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:57,550
Hey Bro,
I'm taking attendance anyway.

2798
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:59,080
Constantly doing that.
It's constantly doing.

2799
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:01,750
I stopped talking to him because it was 
just like hanging out with our retired.

2800
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:03,150
He became a hippie.
Right.

2801
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:06,580
And then I saw him like later,
like five years later,

2802
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:08,410
and that dude was barely,
like,

2803
02:01:08,411 --> 02:01:10,780
he was not doing acid anymore,
but he,

2804
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:15,040
his brain was so god that it was like 
talking to a dumb,

2805
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:17,950
like a mentally retarded person.
Wow.

2806
02:01:18,190 --> 02:01:18,910
Yeah.
Well,

2807
02:01:18,940 --> 02:01:20,230
you know,
that's what they said happened.

2808
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:25,231
And Ted Kaczynski,
like he was a part of the Harvard lsd 

2809
02:01:25,231 --> 02:01:26,110
experiments.
They did.

2810
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:28,100
Oh,
they unlocked them.

2811
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:31,630
Fringe cooked people with lsd while he 
went.

2812
02:01:31,660 --> 02:01:33,010
When he went to,
um,

2813
02:01:33,370 --> 02:01:35,950
I think he was teaching in the Pacific 
Northwest,

2814
02:01:35,951 --> 02:01:36,840
I forget which,
uh,

2815
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:39,800
where he was teaching,
but he went to,

2816
02:01:39,801 --> 02:01:41,360
um,
might have been San Francisco,

2817
02:01:41,361 --> 02:01:43,550
was at Berkeley,
might've been Berkeley.

2818
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,530
Anyway,
he went there.

2819
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:48,260
He taught for a long enough period of 
time.

2820
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:53,320
Yeah.
He taught for a long enough period of 

2821
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:53,960
time that he could store up enough money
to buy a cabin and then start his attack

2822
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:58,961
on technology.
So the guy buys this fucking little 

2823
02:01:58,961 --> 02:02:02,381
piece of land and this little tiny cabin
and goes up there and decides to start 

2824
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:04,790
assassinating people who were involved 
in the creation of technology.

2825
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:10,070
And this all came about because of the 
LSD studies where they dosed this guy to

2826
02:02:10,071 --> 02:02:10,610
the gills.

2827
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:15,740
There's a documentary,
it's a documentary about it called the 

2828
02:02:15,740 --> 02:02:17,880
net and it's all about Ted Kaczynski.
Netflix probably,

2829
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:19,710
probably,
I don't know.

2830
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:24,910
Um,
I feel like it's a foreign film that's 

2831
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:26,711
subtitled,
the net unibomber it's probably a good 

2832
02:02:26,711 --> 02:02:28,190
opportunity to say that shrimp fest is 
August ninth,

2833
02:02:28,220 --> 02:02:30,620
10th and 11th this year.
Shrimp Festival.

2834
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,170
You can get it on youtube if you want 
to.

2835
02:02:33,171 --> 02:02:33,800
Oh really?
Yeah.

2836
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:35,930
The full version is available on 
youtube,

2837
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:37,970
it's called the net,
the unabomber,

2838
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:40,950
lsd and the Internet.
And um,

2839
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:45,260
it's from 2003 and it's a German 
documentary.

2840
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:47,840
It's a,
it's about the raw.

2841
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:49,850
It's fucking fascinating shit,
man.

2842
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:54,290
Because if you see the actual story,
it really is pretty fascinating when you

2843
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:55,280
find out like,
wait a minute,

2844
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:59,870
what did they do to him tell us that he 
was dosed up on,

2845
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:02,510
on,
on Lsd.

2846
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:03,920
Like,
oh,

2847
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:05,420
ms dot lot more sense.
Yeah.

2848
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:06,500
What did you guys do to that?

2849
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,090
God,
did you guys create that guy?

2850
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:11,030
Like this might have been something that
someone created.

2851
02:03:11,270 --> 02:03:13,140
You think about like what the unibomber 
yeah,

2852
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:14,570
that's legit.
Super Heroes.

2853
02:03:14,571 --> 02:03:15,370
Super.
Yeah,

2854
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:16,610
he really is.
He's like,

2855
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:19,510
like Samuel Jackson and unbreakable.
Right?

2856
02:03:20,390 --> 02:03:23,570
So that one,
he's like a real superhero,

2857
02:03:23,870 --> 02:03:25,580
bad guy.
Character.

2858
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:30,610
Super Genius Guy who decides to live in 
the woods as a recluse and attack 

2859
02:03:30,610 --> 02:03:33,680
civilization from the outside.
Still going out there.

2860
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:37,280
It's a good question.
I don't think you ever get away with not

2861
02:03:37,281 --> 02:03:40,370
paying something.
You can't just pay off all your taxes.

2862
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:41,570
You can't say,
hey look,

2863
02:03:41,571 --> 02:03:43,670
I'm going to give you guys a million 
dollars 30 years.

2864
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,830
This is for the next 30 years of 
property taxes were gone.

2865
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:47,750
We don't have to talk anymore.
You can't do that.

2866
02:03:47,751 --> 02:03:49,460
I don't think they still take a piece of
you.

2867
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:52,910
I think property taxes can change too.
That can't ever be free.

2868
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:54,380
You can't ever just be like,
look,

2869
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:56,540
I got my little thing.
That's true.

2870
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:58,520
You can't ever be free.
It's kind of gross in it.

2871
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,070
Had D of property taxes just hit me what
it was and I was like,

2872
02:04:01,071 --> 02:04:01,790
wait,
so you don't.

2873
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:03,170
Even when you have something you don't 
have it,

2874
02:04:03,730 --> 02:04:05,480
so if you don't pay it,
they'll just take back your shit.

2875
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:08,750
You're just renting then just renting 
everywhere.

2876
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:11,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

2877
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:14,690
You're renting everywhere you go and 
ultimately when you die,

2878
02:04:14,691 --> 02:04:19,691
if you don't pay that property tax,
that's the reason why they use to close 

2879
02:04:19,691 --> 02:04:20,270
it on your state.
They take 30 percent of it,

2880
02:04:20,271 --> 02:04:22,850
40 percent of it between there.
Every time you earned a dollar,

2881
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:26,330
then they take eight to 10 percent.
When you spend that dollar and then when

2882
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:28,610
you leave it to someone,
whatever the little you have left,

2883
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:31,070
when you leave it to someone,
a friend or a family member,

2884
02:04:31,071 --> 02:04:33,410
they take half of that.
You know that when they spend it,

2885
02:04:33,420 --> 02:04:34,720
they took 10 more percent.
You know,

2886
02:04:34,721 --> 02:04:38,340
it's really legit though.
States that don't have state taxes.

2887
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:40,350
You know,
if you live in Seattle,

2888
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:43,620
you're in Washington state,
Delaware state taxes,

2889
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:46,020
Florida.
There's quite a few.

2890
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:47,700
Nevada,
Nevada is a big one.

2891
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,530
No state taxes.
That's big.

2892
02:04:50,640 --> 02:04:53,400
Really Nice that that's 10 percent.
Vegas,

2893
02:04:53,401 --> 02:04:55,980
Nevada.
If you want to have an ecstasy,

2894
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:57,900
hooker overload,
that's your spot.

2895
02:04:58,170 --> 02:05:01,890
You should go to fucking start your 
podcast from the hard rock.

2896
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:07,130
Whatever happened to that.
Why aren't you guys doing podcasts from 

2897
02:05:07,130 --> 02:05:09,321
there?
Do a podcast from there from whatever 

2898
02:05:09,321 --> 02:05:12,981
it's called,
the hangover or what's The Sunday thing 

2899
02:05:12,981 --> 02:05:13,020
that they have?
Their Rehab Rehab.

2900
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:18,830
We did one episode and then I guess 
somebody high up that owned the banks 

2901
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:21,450
that own the place or solid and like,
hey,

2902
02:05:21,451 --> 02:05:25,350
we've been having so much problems with 
other shows being on in there.

2903
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:27,990
There was like some show that was a 
reality show based there.

2904
02:05:28,090 --> 02:05:33,090
Oh yeah,
on the show they showed people like 

2905
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:36,890
doing cocaine and all this like hookers,
shit stuff and so I guess they got into 

2906
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:40,920
a lot of trouble for it and then so then
when we did our desk squad podcasts,

2907
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:45,450
they're the bank saw the first episode 
or heard about the first episode.

2908
02:05:45,450 --> 02:05:46,050
I was like,
wait,

2909
02:05:46,051 --> 02:05:51,051
what are you doing?
You're doing another reality show for a 

2910
02:05:51,051 --> 02:05:54,741
guy that called desk squat and know is 
that they accept it and then all these 

2911
02:05:54,741 --> 02:05:55,050
people got fired.
It was hilarious.

2912
02:05:56,610 --> 02:06:00,810
I went there one time,
my bed bug and I smoke cigars,

2913
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:05,811
drank,
did some ecstasy and man I was having a 

2914
02:06:05,811 --> 02:06:05,970
good time until we actually got on the 
plane later and I was like,

2915
02:06:05,971 --> 02:06:09,690
this was a horrible mistake.
I feel like I'm Vegas podcasts,

2916
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,600
like a live vegas podcast could probably
be fucking crazy.

2917
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:13,950
Yeah.
You know,

2918
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:18,900
like do like not just live vegas shows 
but do a live vegas podcast somewhere.

2919
02:06:19,050 --> 02:06:20,820
They'd have to be the right size venue 
though.

2920
02:06:20,890 --> 02:06:23,340
Yeah.
Well you could have a legit podcast.

2921
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:26,610
Is there anywhere in Vegas to go to go 
out to party?

2922
02:06:26,611 --> 02:06:30,530
That's not just a loud nightclub where 
they playing techno music,

2923
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:33,510
Irish pubs and stuff in Vegas.

2924
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:39,320
It's just A.
There's just people that live in Vegas 

2925
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:39,320
all year round.
They're there.

2926
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,020
Yeah.
Go to the green door.

2927
02:06:40,430 --> 02:06:41,430
Was that,
that swingers club?

2928
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,950
Not heard of that.
They just do a comedy show there.

2929
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:50,650
Swingers club.
I heard this yesterday that somebody 

2930
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:50,650
gets a,
an STD to swingers club.

2931
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:52,630
They all have it within a week.
They're all just fucking attorney.

2932
02:06:52,660 --> 02:06:53,880
Yeah.
Dirty little piglets.

2933
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:55,470
Did you see Bill Clinton on?
Oh,

2934
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:58,020
talking about aliens did.
What did he say about aliens?

2935
02:06:58,030 --> 02:06:58,830
Man.
Pretty sweet.

2936
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:00,300
He was saying that,
um,

2937
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:02,160
we could play it,
but it took.

2938
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:04,710
Really didn't.
He didn't say much.

2939
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,450
What he said was that he went and 
looked,

2940
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:08,160
uh,
when he first got into office,

2941
02:07:08,161 --> 02:07:12,550
he went and immediately went looking to 
look into the friendly,

2942
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:15,660
warm area.
Fifty one looking to Roswell crash,

2943
02:07:15,661 --> 02:07:18,360
look into all this different shit and 
find out whatever he could.

2944
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:18,920
That's cool.

2945
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:21,660
And he said that if he did find alien,
she would tell us.

2946
02:07:21,990 --> 02:07:22,440
He goes,
yes,

2947
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:23,280
I would,
yes,

2948
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:25,560
I would.
And he said it and it seemed like he was

2949
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:27,570
telling the truth,
but what does that mean?

2950
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:33,050
I believe that when he sees a 
charismatic relationships with that 

2951
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:33,050
woman,
no,

2952
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:35,560
I just meant obviously I stuck a bit 
fucking cigar in her vagina.

2953
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:40,180
I meant or whatever and it wasn't actual
sex and like we didn't have a baby.

2954
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:41,790
I didn't come into La.
So you weren't,

2955
02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:44,290
you didn't know you were lying to us.
You didn't know God?

2956
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:47,890
Not by my definition of the term.
Not by my definition.

2957
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:49,510
That's how he got out of it.
I forgot about that.

2958
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:51,010
I'm like,
wow,

2959
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:53,410
if he really knew about aliens,
I don't know if he would tell us,

2960
02:07:53,411 --> 02:07:54,790
but he might.
What's it got to lose now?

2961
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:59,820
It's so cool.
That would be the dopest thing to check 

2962
02:07:59,820 --> 02:08:02,311
too.
If you've got an office just for 

2963
02:08:02,311 --> 02:08:02,311
personal inquiry,
like,

2964
02:08:02,311 --> 02:08:02,311
wait.
So I do tell us now.

2965
02:08:02,311 --> 02:08:02,470
Right?
Let's go.

2966
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:04,300
Let's hear.
Who is the Illuminati?

2967
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:06,910
Who's with the aliens?
Let's hear.

2968
02:08:07,450 --> 02:08:10,800
I want to.
I want to know like our JFK here.

2969
02:08:10,801 --> 02:08:11,650
Let's hear it.
Let's hear it.

2970
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:12,670
Oh,
JFK got shot

2971
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:16,350
because I want to know.
I'd want to know what has been going on.

2972
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:18,570
They you do that sort of.

2973
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:20,900
Sure.
To get Jimmy Kimmel's

2974
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,200
question you asked him.
I would want to find out about us.

2975
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:26,730
So you're getting in my second term,
we had the anniversary of Roswell.

2976
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:28,440
You waited that long.
I did.

2977
02:08:30,090 --> 02:08:31,270
Well I did.
And then I,

2978
02:08:31,271 --> 02:08:36,271
there's also area 51.
You remember there was a great Scifi 

2979
02:08:36,271 --> 02:08:38,110
movie where there was an alien kept deep
under the ground area.

2980
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:43,130
Fifty one.
So first I had people go look at the 

2981
02:08:43,130 --> 02:08:44,570
records on area 51 to make sure that 
there was no alien down there.

2982
02:08:47,210 --> 02:08:52,210
I bought that because everybody who 
works there has to stop about an hour 

2983
02:08:52,400 --> 02:08:56,270
away and put on special clothing and 
then drive in and out.

2984
02:08:56,271 --> 02:08:59,810
And that's because a lot of our stealth 
technology is made there.

2985
02:08:59,811 --> 02:09:01,760
We know that now and,
and,

2986
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:04,590
but there are no aliens there.
So then,

2987
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:06,860
uh,
when the Roswell thing came up,

2988
02:09:07,010 --> 02:09:08,360
I knew we'd get,
you know,

2989
02:09:08,730 --> 02:09:12,560
the letters.
So I had all the Roswell papers reviewed

2990
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:16,700
everything.
If you saw that there were aliens there,

2991
02:09:16,701 --> 02:09:18,280
would you tell us?
Yeah,

2992
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:23,500
you would.
We know.

2993
02:09:25,481 --> 02:09:28,300
We know now we live in an ever expanding
universe.

2994
02:09:28,301 --> 02:09:33,301
We know that there are billions of stars
and planets literally out there and the 

2995
02:09:33,301 --> 02:09:38,161
university is getting bigger.
We know from our fancy telescopes that 

2996
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:42,640
just in the last two years,
more than 20 planets had been identified

2997
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:47,700
outside our solar system that seem to be
far enough away from their sons and 

2998
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:51,730
dense enough that they might be able to 
support some form of live.

2999
02:09:51,790 --> 02:09:55,960
So it makes it increasingly less likely 
that we're alone.

3000
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:57,190
I want to get high with him yet.

3001
02:09:57,230 --> 02:09:57,840
And they,

3002
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:04,960
I don't know,
but if we were visited someday,

3003
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:07,750
I wouldn't be surprised.
I just hope that,

3004
02:10:07,751 --> 02:10:10,780
uh,
is not like independence day.

3005
02:10:10,910 --> 02:10:11,630
Yeah.
Right.

3006
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,630
That it's a,
you know,

3007
02:10:13,631 --> 02:10:15,490
a,
a conflict.

3008
02:10:15,610 --> 02:10:19,420
Well now we have maybe the other way to 
unite this increasingly divided world of

3009
02:10:19,421 --> 02:10:19,810
ours.

3010
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:26,670
Yeah.
He actually had the same point that 

3011
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:28,351
Reagan had.
Remember Reagan had that speech and he 

3012
02:10:28,351 --> 02:10:28,750
talked about.
I often wonder if we,

3013
02:10:28,751 --> 02:10:33,751
you know,
it was talking about an invasion from 

3014
02:10:33,751 --> 02:10:34,160
another planet.
If we were invaded by another

3015
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,160
planet,
would that be enough to join America 

3016
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:41,441
together,
joined the world together rather and 

3017
02:10:41,441 --> 02:10:42,440
making us realize that we're all in this
together.

3018
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:44,780
Do you think that some will do with they
have aliens and we're like,

3019
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:47,460
Hey,
plan the tech make aliens.

3020
02:10:48,630 --> 02:10:50,660
That would unite people in a lot of 
ways.

3021
02:10:51,260 --> 02:10:55,250
First of them versus if there was a real
alien invasion,

3022
02:10:55,560 --> 02:11:00,360
then what was that show with the lizard 
tongues versus versus v.

3023
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:02,630
that's it,
man.

3024
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,650
If there really were aliens here,
if they're smart enough to get here,

3025
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:10,520
they're smart enough to be running shit.
There really are aliens.

3026
02:11:10,521 --> 02:11:12,770
They're like in the banking industry and
really already here.

3027
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:17,800
It's taken over.
They just decided to just run this 

3028
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:17,800
stupid government.
How we can control everything.

3029
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:22,290
Oh,
it would they to do it for themselves 

3030
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:24,551
and just do an infiltrate the banking 
business and control the entire planet.

3031
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,760
Just from the controlling the resources 
and the money is internet.

3032
02:11:29,090 --> 02:11:34,090
Where do we find out the internet?
It is analia home lives off people's 

3033
02:11:34,101 --> 02:11:36,410
attention.
Well now it's super powerful.

3034
02:11:36,470 --> 02:11:38,840
Technology might be an alien.
How about that?

3035
02:11:39,550 --> 02:11:42,470
Technology might be an alien that forced
human beings to create it.

3036
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:48,280
Technologies and alien that exists in an
idea existed in idea and the creativity 

3037
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:53,711
that infects human consciousness.
The human consciousness develops this 

3038
02:11:53,711 --> 02:11:57,461
extraordinary ability to manipulate,
matter and change its environment and 

3039
02:11:58,221 --> 02:12:02,060
then the human being accelerates it from
there so that this alien has come in the

3040
02:12:02,061 --> 02:12:07,061
form of an idea and that idea is just a 
simple desire to improve upon your 

3041
02:12:07,061 --> 02:12:11,831
surroundings and that in that desire it 
in the ever x accelerating and 

3042
02:12:12,681 --> 02:12:17,681
escalating nature of human beings that 
this desire builds on the past 

3043
02:12:17,750 --> 02:12:22,750
generations work and they build on that 
past generations work and they keep 

3044
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:22,910
going on and on and on and 
exponentially.

3045
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:27,910
The group of people that understand the 
technology gets bigger and bigger and 

3046
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:27,910
bigger,
and then finally,

3047
02:12:27,910 --> 02:12:32,320
boom.
It gives birth to whatever the fuck the 

3048
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,811
salient is.
This alien meaning this artificial 

3049
02:12:34,811 --> 02:12:39,310
biological life that's created by 
technology that just used the human 

3050
02:12:40,251 --> 02:12:44,560
imagination to give birth to it so that 
imagine if you send ideas and you sat.

3051
02:12:44,561 --> 02:12:49,561
An idea literally is an alien seed and 
you drop an ID and a group of monkeys 

3052
02:12:49,561 --> 02:12:52,880
and you know that in x amount of million
years they're going to build you.

3053
02:12:53,170 --> 02:12:56,150
Right?
Because that's just a natural progress.

3054
02:12:56,570 --> 02:13:01,570
Yeah.
Sort of like a caterpillar is naturally 

3055
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:01,570
going to become a butterfly.
If you drop the seats,

3056
02:13:01,570 --> 02:13:02,930
yeah,
there's going to be chaos.

3057
02:13:02,931 --> 02:13:05,980
There's going to be fucking crazy wars.
There's going to be battles.

3058
02:13:05,981 --> 02:13:07,880
It'd be nuclear weapons.
They'll be pollution.

3059
02:13:07,881 --> 02:13:09,380
There was,
but at the end of the day,

3060
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:14,560
these dumb monkeys are eventually going 
to give birth to you that you're going 

3061
02:13:14,651 --> 02:13:19,651
to come out of it no matter what because
what you are is artificial intelligence 

3062
02:13:19,651 --> 02:13:21,050
is plugged into the power of the 
universe.

3063
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:23,350
Artists,
you know,

3064
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:27,320
artificial intelligence that requires a 
biological being to make it.

3065
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:30,020
But then once the biological being makes
it okay,

3066
02:13:30,021 --> 02:13:35,021
I got it from here,
and then you have porn and you come out 

3067
02:13:35,021 --> 02:13:38,241
guns blazing and by the time that human 
beings have choke themselves off the 

3068
02:13:38,241 --> 02:13:41,901
earth now literally choke themselves 
through to pump in their own shit into 

3069
02:13:41,901 --> 02:13:42,900
the ocean and when you're okay because 
you're there,

3070
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:47,130
it doesn't matter because this 
biological lifeforms unnecessary anyway,

3071
02:13:47,131 --> 02:13:50,620
because it's just a tool to create the 
technological life.

3072
02:13:50,621 --> 02:13:54,050
And that's how it comes into a place.
And exactly.

3073
02:13:54,070 --> 02:13:56,460
I moved so slowly that so quickly with 
them that it's like whatever.

3074
02:13:56,461 --> 02:13:57,810
So it'll only be a couple trillion 
years.

3075
02:13:57,830 --> 02:14:00,780
Well it doesn't matter for them because 
are infinite live forever,

3076
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:03,480
will have a baby.
They just,

3077
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,350
they just say,
look,

3078
02:14:04,351 --> 02:14:06,450
we'll just plant a seed.
It takes time to grow.

3079
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:11,750
And that seed is his curiosity and 
imagination and the ability to 

3080
02:14:11,750 --> 02:14:12,240
manipulate their environment with their 
fingers.

3081
02:14:12,780 --> 02:14:17,780
So they get in there and they start 
fixing shit and changing it and fucking 

3082
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:21,080
boom and tightening things up and 
clipping things off and lighting things 

3083
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:23,700
on fire and blowing things up and 
pressing buttons.

3084
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:27,690
And next thing you help this fucking 
terminator steps out of a machine.

3085
02:14:28,360 --> 02:14:29,970
Did,
it just took awhile,

3086
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:32,430
took a million years,
took a 100,000

3087
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:35,550
years to just what has gestation period.
Yeah.

3088
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:37,530
It's just what happens.
Sort of like,

3089
02:14:37,531 --> 02:14:38,640
um,
you know,

3090
02:14:38,641 --> 02:14:39,590
you've seen those,
uh,

3091
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:43,770
those weird parasites that grow inside a
different insects bodies and they forced

3092
02:14:43,771 --> 02:14:45,750
the insect to do things to make them 
hatch.

3093
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:51,390
There's a grasshopper that gets affected
by this aquatic worm and it commits 

3094
02:14:51,390 --> 02:14:53,700
suicide so that the worm could give 
birth,

3095
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:58,860
could give birth through its body.
That worm bursts out of its body in the 

3096
02:14:58,860 --> 02:14:58,860
water.

3097
02:14:58,860 --> 02:15:03,120
Oh really?
So it actually wires the grasshoppers 

3098
02:15:03,120 --> 02:15:03,570
brain and talks to grasshopper and 
drowning itself.

3099
02:15:03,571 --> 02:15:06,090
So it can be born out of the water.
Yeah.

3100
02:15:06,120 --> 02:15:11,120
That's what lives his whole gestation 
period out of the water that's going 

3101
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:11,120
into it.
Wow.

3102
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:11,750
Yeah.
Lives inside a fucking grasp yet.

3103
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:14,520
Biology.
So now why wouldn't anyone research that

3104
02:15:14,521 --> 02:15:16,710
shit and try to use it for a weapon?
Of course,

3105
02:15:16,730 --> 02:15:18,630
of course you should.
Of course they would.

3106
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:22,080
And that in that acceleration,
it's like we,

3107
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:24,840
if you think about Eylea,
what are,

3108
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:27,120
what are we doing?
If we're doing that,

3109
02:15:27,150 --> 02:15:29,160
if we're giving birth to this 
technology,

3110
02:15:29,310 --> 02:15:32,190
this technology literally is become a 
part of our lives.

3111
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:36,720
It's become a part of our bodies in the 
sense that you have a phone connected to

3112
02:15:36,721 --> 02:15:39,360
your body at all times.
It's becoming more a part of your body.

3113
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:44,361
When you start going with the Google 
glass and these new ideas they have 

3114
02:15:44,361 --> 02:15:44,750
about possible contact lenses.

3115
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:48,330
The future that you can see screens that
only you can see,

3116
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:53,510
you're gonna.
Be able to read all these things out 

3117
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:55,790
like you're going to be on a date,
you're going to see tech show up over 

3118
02:15:55,790 --> 02:15:55,790
her eyelids and you're like,
bitch,

3119
02:15:55,790 --> 02:15:56,760
are you texting your friends?
No,

3120
02:15:56,761 --> 02:15:59,630
but you'll see a little bit.
Are you getting texts right now?

3121
02:15:59,680 --> 02:16:04,680
You have auto text on so people could 
just text you while we were out at 

3122
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:04,970
dinner.
I'll text on,

3123
02:16:05,070 --> 02:16:06,990
take your lenses off.
I'm not taking my lenses off.

3124
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:12,050
We'll then turn all of textile.
It's off or this thing they were doing 

3125
02:16:12,050 --> 02:16:13,260
about whether or not safe to drive with 
them and they were like,

3126
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:14,200
you know,
it's gonna be distracted,

3127
02:16:14,201 --> 02:16:19,201
is going to be texting,
and we looked at directions and the guy 

3128
02:16:19,201 --> 02:16:19,201
response was like,
it's actually way safer.

3129
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:20,760
Like if you don't understand the 
experience,

3130
02:16:20,761 --> 02:16:22,290
you're not like looking at it.
It's,

3131
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:28,010
it's just part of your site.
It's definitely better than looking 

3132
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:28,010
down.
Yeah.

3133
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:30,070
They used to have those things were.
So the speedometer it would up onto the.

3134
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,600
Onto the,
like a windshield.

3135
02:16:31,630 --> 02:16:32,860
Yeah.
And so you'd see it.

3136
02:16:32,861 --> 02:16:35,710
So you could still be looking at the 
road while they still have it.

3137
02:16:35,940 --> 02:16:37,120
That was pretty cool.
Yeah.

3138
02:16:37,121 --> 02:16:39,220
They have it still corvettes habit.
Really?

3139
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:41,940
Yeah.
To exist in a lot of cars and car.

3140
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,240
So you're not taking your eyes off the 
road to use less,

3141
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:46,270
but if you were texting,
what in your mind be off it?

3142
02:16:47,150 --> 02:16:49,180
Like if I can look right at you in my 
mind wanders,

3143
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:52,420
I don't even see you.
Let my mind wander or something else.

3144
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:57,450
That's true.
It's definitely not as good as only 

3145
02:16:57,450 --> 02:16:57,490
paying attention to the road.
And I see it all the time,

3146
02:16:57,491 --> 02:17:00,520
I'll see like someone weaving and you 
look down and you see they're looking at

3147
02:17:00,521 --> 02:17:05,521
their phone and just like,
God dammit you fuckhead were even then 

3148
02:17:05,521 --> 02:17:05,770
you're still keeping it out and you're 
on the high way.

3149
02:17:06,070 --> 02:17:08,920
Like being on the highway and weaving 
your phone is scary.

3150
02:17:08,930 --> 02:17:10,680
Should be more careful next time.
Yeah.

3151
02:17:11,050 --> 02:17:12,940
Next paragraph.
What are you going to say?

3152
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:15,550
Yeah,
he's fucking people.

3153
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:19,600
That's one thing that I think you really
should not do,

3154
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,060
especially when you're on the God 
texting and driving.

3155
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:22,990
Yeah.
Fuck,

3156
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:24,730
that's a scary thing.
I still do it though,

3157
02:17:25,950 --> 02:17:29,110
but I still do it.
Why don't you do a text thing,

3158
02:17:29,650 --> 02:17:30,610
like a,
um,

3159
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:33,130
a voice to text thing.
You could do that,

3160
02:17:33,131 --> 02:17:34,210
but then you've got to open that.
Oh No.

3161
02:17:34,211 --> 02:17:35,770
They do it on the iphone system to do 
that.

3162
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:36,980
Didn't get it right though.
It's like,

3163
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,670
come on.
Then you get all like delete it.

3164
02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:43,710
Start over.
This is being done through voice 

3165
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:43,710
recognition software because I'm not an 
asshole.

3166
02:17:43,710 --> 02:17:45,110
So like pretty much close.
Yes.

3167
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:50,380
Oh,
right next to me if you need 

3168
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:50,380
clarification.

3169
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:54,060
Yeah.
The old everybody used to have a button 

3170
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:55,840
and send like real simple stuff.
I've tried for like a Siri read me the 

3171
02:17:57,841 --> 02:18:01,330
new text and it says options replied or 
whatever.

3172
02:18:01,390 --> 02:18:02,800
Ooh,
is it work?

3173
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:05,870
But it's good to talk slowly.
But the,

3174
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:08,740
the complaints about Siri are pretty 
fucking profound.

3175
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:09,760
Serious,
been fixed.

3176
02:18:09,790 --> 02:18:12,730
Then if say totally pretty awesome.
How awesome.

3177
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:15,790
I love it.
I use it all the time that it's good for

3178
02:18:15,791 --> 02:18:17,750
weight.
Like simple things like Siri,

3179
02:18:17,970 --> 02:18:20,590
call my friend John or,
or Siri,

3180
02:18:21,570 --> 02:18:22,980
I need to go home.
You have to talk to.

3181
02:18:23,020 --> 02:18:28,020
You got to call her Siri first.
She listens better if you talked to her 

3182
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:29,430
that way.
Like I need,

3183
02:18:29,650 --> 02:18:32,500
I need to drive home and then,
you know,

3184
02:18:32,501 --> 02:18:34,450
it was say like you can choose.
Wait.

3185
02:18:34,550 --> 02:18:36,190
Yeah.
I think if you pointed to something like

3186
02:18:36,191 --> 02:18:37,900
Siri,
find me directions home.

3187
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:43,410
Like if you talk to it more than that,
it reads and understands those verbs 

3188
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:44,260
better.
When you said I need to go home,

3189
02:18:44,261 --> 02:18:45,550
what did it say?
Okay,

3190
02:18:45,551 --> 02:18:50,551
here I need to drive home.
Getting directions to Brian Redman and 

3191
02:18:55,980 --> 02:18:56,670
you're like,
no,

3192
02:18:56,700 --> 02:18:59,570
no worry.
Yeah.

3193
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:00,800
And then it takes me right to,
you know,

3194
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:01,890
driving directions

3195
02:19:09,550 --> 02:19:14,550
almost gave the line of freaks outside 
your house.

3196
02:19:14,581 --> 02:19:19,581
It doesn't matter man.
I'll be walking to starbucks and people 

3197
02:19:19,581 --> 02:19:21,450
tweet me photos of me walking now.
Fuck you.

3198
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:25,560
Fuck you will leave you alone once you 
realize it's no big deal.

3199
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,910
Don't me that he goes,
why don't we read with your shirt off on

3200
02:19:28,911 --> 02:19:31,610
sunset and Rebecca,
because I don't give a fuck.

3201
02:19:32,250 --> 02:19:33,510
So I get.
Yeah.

3202
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:36,470
So I'll get Mitch.
So,

3203
02:19:36,471 --> 02:19:38,780
um,
this trip is triumphant.

3204
02:19:38,781 --> 02:19:41,810
Return to tempe.
Was that symbolic in,

3205
02:19:41,811 --> 02:19:42,970
in any sort of a way?
Well,

3206
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:45,500
I did think a little bit like that.
Like we used to go there with you.

3207
02:19:45,501 --> 02:19:47,660
That was one of the first stops we would
make happy.

3208
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:49,310
That was pretty much every year.
Yeah,

3209
02:19:49,311 --> 02:19:50,760
that was a big one.
So it was like I did,

3210
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:54,410
we did a phoenix in a up lie before,
which was like fine and good.

3211
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:55,160
But this was like,
oh yeah,

3212
02:19:55,161 --> 02:19:57,620
this place.
That was one of the early,

3213
02:19:57,621 --> 02:19:59,320
like big clubs.
Yeah.

3214
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:04,360
Also a thought love was like,
I'll never be able to headline that 

3215
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:04,360
club.
It's too big.

3216
02:20:04,360 --> 02:20:05,910
You know,
even if you go to 300 seater,

3217
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:07,460
that place is 50 percent bigger than 
that.

3218
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:09,620
Yeah.
It's a big spot.

3219
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:10,730
Yeah.
So,

3220
02:20:10,940 --> 02:20:14,930
so actually doing it and getting to pull
it off a little bit of that.

3221
02:20:15,010 --> 02:20:16,250
You know what?
You have to step back for a second.

3222
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:18,090
Like how did you guys bring anybody 
else's?

3223
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:19,080
Just Youtube.
Polly.

3224
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:21,890
Polly.
Polly casinos opened for us who?

3225
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:24,010
POLICA.
He just has these lives,

3226
02:20:24,011 --> 02:20:29,011
their lives.
So he would just do a few minutes and 

3227
02:20:29,011 --> 02:20:29,270
then bring somebody up.
Yeah,

3228
02:20:29,510 --> 02:20:31,010
that's awesome man.
It's cool crowds.

3229
02:20:31,011 --> 02:20:33,710
He has a problem that I tell everybody 
to opens for me.

3230
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:34,730
I'm like,
just so you know,

3231
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:35,750
a lot of them.

3232
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:39,800
I mean a lot of them got highlight the 
minute before the show started.

3233
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:41,360
Yeah.
So don't.

3234
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:43,140
If they're just like smiling for your 
first time,

3235
02:20:43,141 --> 02:20:45,770
I just don't read into that.
Like you're doing fine.

3236
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:49,000
Do you get him high Paul?
Yeah,

3237
02:20:49,230 --> 02:20:50,060
yeah,
he was,

3238
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:51,620
yeah,
I got the local Thai.

3239
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,810
I try not to.
I try to like later in the week,

3240
02:20:53,811 --> 02:20:55,370
once I've gotten to know them,
then I have to impress me.

3241
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:57,470
Get them high like you used to get me 
like way too hot.

3242
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:59,230
Do you,
uh,

3243
02:20:59,270 --> 02:21:02,150
do you impress upon them that it would 
be good to get high before the show?

3244
02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:03,420
Yeah.
And then if I don't do that,

3245
02:21:03,421 --> 02:21:05,390
I'm like I let them be professional for 
a show or two.

3246
02:21:05,391 --> 02:21:06,710
But then it's like,
come on bitch,

3247
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:07,900
come on,
come on.

3248
02:21:08,030 --> 02:21:10,640
Just fine.
Just knowing they won't be,

3249
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:11,930
but just like,
just do it.

3250
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:12,440
Who Cares?

3251
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,970
Just do it.
She's not even hit the owner.

3252
02:21:14,010 --> 02:21:19,010
Not even a year report.
I remember there was one lady in Tempe 

3253
02:21:19,010 --> 02:21:20,710
that would be like call Dan Murphy's 
because I had this Lasky,

3254
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:25,720
had his fucking spies.
I brought a flask because you weren't 

3255
02:21:25,720 --> 02:21:28,070
allowed to drink on stage.
We had to Brian's out the idea.

3256
02:21:28,400 --> 02:21:29,750
He goes,
well they won't give us alcohol.

3257
02:21:29,751 --> 02:21:32,490
How about we just go buy some alcohol?
And the Joe is like,

3258
02:21:32,510 --> 02:21:33,680
I'm rich.
That's right.

3259
02:21:34,270 --> 02:21:39,270
Let's go buy alcohol.
We went to the liquor store and brought 

3260
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:40,940
back whiskey,
vodka and flasks.

3261
02:21:41,150 --> 02:21:43,790
And then a green room is set up 
perfectly because when you go in there's

3262
02:21:43,791 --> 02:21:48,791
a little alcove deep in there.
And to the left that you can't see from 

3263
02:21:48,791 --> 02:21:52,061
the doorway.
And it became a joke on stage because I 

3264
02:21:52,061 --> 02:21:55,580
pulled out the flask and I said I like 
to take my diet coke and then I like to 

3265
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:56,340
pour like warm coconut,
like keep,

3266
02:21:56,480 --> 02:21:59,480
keep the warm coke and this thing just 
heated up with my body.

3267
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:01,010
That's right.
And then I can pour it in there.

3268
02:22:01,011 --> 02:22:06,011
See it's st color as coke.
And a lot of people think it's like 

3269
02:22:06,011 --> 02:22:06,011
whiskey or something.
But that's crazy.

3270
02:22:06,011 --> 02:22:06,770
You're not allowed to drink whiskey on 
stage,

3271
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:10,610
so you keep getting cokes brought to you
on stage you were taking.

3272
02:22:11,510 --> 02:22:13,900
And the uh,
the waiter,

3273
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:15,500
I'm like,
uh,

3274
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:16,850
whoever it was,
waitress,

3275
02:22:16,851 --> 02:22:19,880
waiter ratted me out.
And so Dan called me up and he's like,

3276
02:22:19,881 --> 02:22:21,650
what are you actually drinking on that 
stage?

3277
02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:23,000
And I said,
no,

3278
02:22:23,001 --> 02:22:25,190
it's a gag man.
I'm a professional.

3279
02:22:28,450 --> 02:22:31,170
Was I didn't even care if I was loud.
I was like,

3280
02:22:31,171 --> 02:22:32,970
listen,
dude I know is not a real law.

3281
02:22:33,150 --> 02:22:34,920
So cuts are made up of state law.
Yeah.

3282
02:22:34,921 --> 02:22:37,560
They made up a law to run this place.
Well,

3283
02:22:38,390 --> 02:22:43,390
the law was you weren't allowed to drink
on stage in a few years.

3284
02:22:43,431 --> 02:22:45,860
I was like,
what a weird law exist.

3285
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:51,230
It was bullshit.
They made up a fake law because they 

3286
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:51,810
didn't want comics being comics.
But then when I was done,

3287
02:22:51,811 --> 02:22:56,811
once I went to the bar,
I could have a beer and I saw the box 

3288
02:22:56,811 --> 02:22:56,811
and to look over my shoulder and I saw 
he was looking at.

3289
02:22:56,811 --> 02:22:57,660
I was one of the owners and I was like,
dude,

3290
02:22:57,661 --> 02:22:58,700
I'm done.
Yeah,

3291
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:00,560
I'm officers.
Give me the fucking beer.

3292
02:23:01,010 --> 02:23:01,560
Well,
look at them.

3293
02:23:01,561 --> 02:23:03,420
I'm a grown man.
Got All crazy.

3294
02:23:03,421 --> 02:23:08,421
They're just so frustrated here.
The tempo alcoholic drinks for you guys.

3295
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:12,530
So I'd be like,
Oh yeah,

3296
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:17,110
well when,
when that dude uh,

3297
02:23:17,390 --> 02:23:17,900
who,
uh,

3298
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:20,910
owned it wouldn't let us have a shot 
before the show.

3299
02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:22,110
I'm like,
listen man,

3300
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:23,170
come on.
You're,

3301
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:25,560
you're crazy.
Like you can't do this.

3302
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:26,910
Like,
I know what I'm doing.

3303
02:23:27,090 --> 02:23:29,280
You don't think I know what I'm doing.
I'm not going to go off the rails here.

3304
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:31,260
If I go off the rails,
you don't book me again.

3305
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:33,030
I've never gone off the rails.
But here's the thing,

3306
02:23:33,031 --> 02:23:35,760
these people have gone off the rails,
not at a comedy club,

3307
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:41,480
but I've never fucked up a weekend.
I've never gone in there and got drunk 

3308
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:42,530
on purpose and I bet we've all gone off 
the rails trunk.

3309
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:43,410
Okay.
That's not what I'm saying.

3310
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:46,560
But I'm saying as a professional and I 
think that if you're,

3311
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:48,540
you know,
if you run into a comedy club,

3312
02:23:48,541 --> 02:23:52,470
you got to let comedian's comedian and 
then if we're not good then don't invite

3313
02:23:52,471 --> 02:23:53,400
us back at that price.

3314
02:23:53,670 --> 02:23:55,500
We know what we're doing for the most 
part.

3315
02:23:56,460 --> 02:23:59,520
And if not I do delete.
Shouldn't be in the content business.

3316
02:23:59,521 --> 02:24:01,590
I don't really like dirty.
I do this,

3317
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:03,690
don't worry about it.
Yeah,

3318
02:24:03,691 --> 02:24:08,691
that's a big one.
They don't really like dirty thing like 

3319
02:24:08,691 --> 02:24:08,691
oh come on,
you know.

3320
02:24:08,691 --> 02:24:13,161
And that's another thing too.
One time saw some open or through good 

3321
02:24:13,161 --> 02:24:16,311
with 30 is a problem with a lot of these
guys that run these clubs that are like 

3322
02:24:16,311 --> 02:24:16,580
in recovery.
And that was that guy.

3323
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:22,640
He was a nice guy,
but he had an issue in the past with 

3324
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:26,540
alcohol and so he was very adamant that 
alcohol is a bad thing and he's in 

3325
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:31,491
recovery and he's very religious and so 
having us there just was kind of a crazy

3326
02:24:32,041 --> 02:24:35,640
thing in the first place and then having
us there and us wanting to drink,

3327
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:39,590
so it wasn't the guy that that,
that not the crazy guys they got rid of,

3328
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:43,350
but the next guy came in who turned out 
to be like the more majority.

3329
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:49,010
Then the other guy remember that they 
will open up a new club in town and he 

3330
02:24:49,651 --> 02:24:50,370
goes,
what the fuck?

3331
02:24:50,590 --> 02:24:52,650
Yeah,
this is my own company or,

3332
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:54,900
and then all of a sudden then he just 
disappeared.

3333
02:24:55,050 --> 02:24:57,720
Well,
didn't he have like a health problem?

3334
02:24:57,721 --> 02:25:00,300
Like a real bad health failure?
They found him dead.

3335
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:01,820
They found him dead in the hotel.
I'll

3336
02:25:01,850 --> 02:25:06,070
failure bunch of low investors,
two week run.

3337
02:25:06,220 --> 02:25:11,220
When they said they hadn't heard from 
him in a week and he was a goody two 

3338
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:11,220
shoes before.
I was like,

3339
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:11,480
oh,
he's a suicide or something,

3340
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:12,670
or a murderer.
He's gone.

3341
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:13,930
Who knows?
Dawn,

3342
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:15,660
let's not talk about it too much in the 
air.

3343
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,530
We don't want to be a part of it.
We want to make sure that we're going to

3344
02:25:17,531 --> 02:25:19,550
kill him back.
I'm going to be there.

3345
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:21,400
We want to make sure we can keep going 
to that club.

3346
02:25:21,460 --> 02:25:23,950
Part of the reason that I started some 
investigation.

3347
02:25:24,150 --> 02:25:25,930
Oh right.
You think it's a straight up murder,

3348
02:25:29,580 --> 02:25:30,850
man.
You're on the record with.

3349
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:33,580
Oh son of a bitch.
I see what you're doing.

3350
02:25:33,581 --> 02:25:37,500
I can't believe you.
I trusted you next.

3351
02:25:37,560 --> 02:25:42,560
I'm Rogan chronicles.
That was a place where we had years and 

3352
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:45,180
years of sets there.
I mean we,

3353
02:25:45,330 --> 02:25:47,870
I was doing so many crazy people.

3354
02:25:49,260 --> 02:25:54,260
That's one of the first place I open 
there for Pauli once and it was like 

3355
02:25:54,260 --> 02:25:55,720
first day of the weekend and so we doing
is merchant.

3356
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:58,350
Some girl came up with like a t shirt,
big busty Asu.

3357
02:25:58,351 --> 02:25:59,460
So with like a teacher,
you know,

3358
02:25:59,470 --> 02:26:01,510
they cut their tee shirts.
She did that.

3359
02:26:01,520 --> 02:26:02,280
She goes,
hi,

3360
02:26:02,290 --> 02:26:04,600
really lecture set.
And I didn't know what it was back then,

3361
02:26:04,601 --> 02:26:07,450
but I got the tingling in your balls.
You know what it was.

3362
02:26:07,451 --> 02:26:09,010
I didn't know what that means.
Just say,

3363
02:26:09,011 --> 02:26:09,730
Hey,
what are you doing?

3364
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:11,290
Like Oh,
let's hang out.

3365
02:26:11,320 --> 02:26:13,240
We should hang out.
So your spidey sense,

3366
02:26:13,241 --> 02:26:14,250
we're going off.
And you were like,

3367
02:26:15,060 --> 02:26:16,870
I just waited.
What's your signal?

3368
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:21,930
Yeah,
I just waited and didn't ever ask and 

3369
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:21,930
she left.
I just thought she would eventually find

3370
02:26:21,930 --> 02:26:22,600
me,
but that was never going to happen.

3371
02:26:22,990 --> 02:26:24,130
Yeah,
that's highly unlikely.

3372
02:26:24,190 --> 02:26:25,510
God,
I let it go.

3373
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:28,120
If that happened on a Saturday I'd be 
able to handle it.

3374
02:26:28,121 --> 02:26:30,490
But on the Thursday or Wednesday,
that's what I'm saying,

3375
02:26:30,491 --> 02:26:34,870
Dawg.
Saturday you'd be like comfortable.

3376
02:26:34,910 --> 02:26:36,850
Still upset.
I have gotten hurt in that girl.

3377
02:26:37,410 --> 02:26:41,740
I guess she would've had herpes.
Maybe she wouldn't know,

3378
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:43,600
but then it's just negative but I didn't
go for it.

3379
02:26:44,730 --> 02:26:48,280
You silly boy.
Have you had your man period lately?

3380
02:26:49,150 --> 02:26:50,360
No.
What's that?

3381
02:26:50,400 --> 02:26:53,770
And I have this theory that when we shit
and it's all bloody in there,

3382
02:26:54,340 --> 02:26:56,440
that it's possible that he does at the 
same time,

3383
02:26:56,441 --> 02:26:58,930
like it's based on the moon.
How often do you guys?

3384
02:26:58,931 --> 02:27:02,260
Shit when you get your shit happens.
It happens every couple of months.

3385
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:07,261
It goes for like a week week,
that week executives are the hemorrhoid 

3386
02:27:07,261 --> 02:27:08,800
thing.
It has to be,

3387
02:27:09,730 --> 02:27:11,500
oh my God,
and then you wipe and you just like,

3388
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:12,760
oh,
I'm still wiping a lot of shit.

3389
02:27:12,770 --> 02:27:13,150
Be like,
no.

3390
02:27:13,151 --> 02:27:18,151
It was just soaking red blood.
That's all die on your hand and go 

3391
02:27:18,151 --> 02:27:22,480
straight through the toilet paper.
You guys both need to go to a doctor 

3392
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:22,720
together and find out what aliens are 
raping you.

3393
02:27:22,721 --> 02:27:26,830
In the middle of that study,
do a fucking camera over your bed.

3394
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:31,870
That's something really watched aliens 
come into the room and take you through 

3395
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:31,900
the walls in the middle of the night.
Return you later.

3396
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:34,510
It's sometimes when you stand up at your
toilet seat.

3397
02:27:34,511 --> 02:27:37,280
Looks like Dexter,
like the blood spots that you know.

3398
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:39,310
We didn't go in the water.
If you have too low,

3399
02:27:39,460 --> 02:27:44,460
man,
if you guys are both shit out that much 

3400
02:27:44,460 --> 02:27:46,831
blood pours out the warmth.
It's like a warm fuzzy.

3401
02:27:46,990 --> 02:27:50,590
It's like you take a girl and turn it 
over real thin beaker and turn it over.

3402
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:51,570
Like about that amount of.

3403
02:27:51,650 --> 02:27:56,530
This is not for the shock girls.
Those not that much water.

3404
02:27:56,710 --> 02:27:59,260
Not something to be proud of.
You guys are both.

3405
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:00,590
Jamie,
are you okay?

3406
02:28:01,410 --> 02:28:04,030
Are you and I in the same boat?
I can tell you this though.

3407
02:28:04,031 --> 02:28:07,540
I did have a massive diarrhea problem 
last week.

3408
02:28:07,580 --> 02:28:10,300
It was really worst diarrhea problem.
My problem was a long time.

3409
02:28:10,301 --> 02:28:13,600
I do not know multiple days or one 
diarrhea in multiple days.

3410
02:28:13,660 --> 02:28:18,660
I don't know if it was a stomach cold.
I don't know if it was something that I 

3411
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:20,500
ate that didn't agree with me,
but it was like one day I had a headache

3412
02:28:20,790 --> 02:28:21,980
and my head I was like,

3413
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,850
wow,
I feel so.

3414
02:28:22,851 --> 02:28:26,390
I think it's like a food poisoning issue
because I had a headache and I was like,

3415
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:27,660
man,
I feel weak.

3416
02:28:28,180 --> 02:28:29,420
Terrible.
No,

3417
02:28:29,421 --> 02:28:31,020
definitely not.
Definitely for that.

3418
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:32,210
Yeah,
it was.

3419
02:28:32,211 --> 02:28:32,800
Um,
no,

3420
02:28:32,810 --> 02:28:34,100
it,
it was post ham,

3421
02:28:34,130 --> 02:28:37,250
but I hadn't eaten the ham for days,
but it definitely wasn't that.

3422
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:40,970
It was something that had had I think 
that day or before that day anyways.

3423
02:28:40,980 --> 02:28:43,340
Diarrhea.
Oh my goodness.

3424
02:28:43,960 --> 02:28:45,980
I mean it was more than a week after I'd
eaten the Ham.

3425
02:28:45,981 --> 02:28:48,680
Now that I think about it,
did you mix it with the regular dump and

3426
02:28:48,681 --> 02:28:50,180
have like a no,
dude,

3427
02:28:50,181 --> 02:28:53,840
it was just this is what happened in 
whatever was going on inside.

3428
02:28:53,841 --> 02:28:58,841
My stomach was converting everything I 
ate into liquid and I didn't even make 

3429
02:28:59,691 --> 02:29:01,520
sense.
It was like defined physics.

3430
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:03,980
How solidified was it w?
It was water.

3431
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:09,100
If you dropped it on a,
an inclined table at a 40 degree 

3432
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:09,100
incline.

3433
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:13,870
Would it go straight off the table?
Take a minute to go to ride like a 

3434
02:29:13,870 --> 02:29:16,880
fucking great wave through Ray Brown,
wave of destruction,

3435
02:29:17,210 --> 02:29:18,260
dude,
it would rumble.

3436
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:20,060
My stomach would rumble and then I would
go,

3437
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:21,830
oh shit,
and I'd have really bathroom.

3438
02:29:21,831 --> 02:29:24,500
Then I'd get to the and I would hold it 
up and commercials like,

3439
02:29:24,530 --> 02:29:25,620
listen,
I wouldn't.

3440
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:27,410
There's no way.
I was brave enough to fart.

3441
02:29:27,690 --> 02:29:32,690
There was no way.
There was no way because I would get 

3442
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:32,690
into that tub or get it out of the bowl 
rather,

3443
02:29:32,810 --> 02:29:36,560
and it would just hear whoosh,
just just,

3444
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:41,920
just water tub my ass.
Complete water for like two days and 

3445
02:29:42,951 --> 02:29:47,951
then it became like very untrustworthy 
shit for the fourth day and I got 

3446
02:29:51,141 --> 02:29:54,380
hemorrhoids.
I had to go get preparation h oh no.

3447
02:29:55,460 --> 02:30:00,460
Squeezing it and pushing it.
Trying to get it to come out for so 

3448
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:00,460
long,
which is really bad.

3449
02:30:00,460 --> 02:30:01,250
Push air bubbles into your asshole.
Well,

3450
02:30:01,251 --> 02:30:06,251
I think squeezing your ass like that,
trying to poop is very bad for you.

3451
02:30:06,380 --> 02:30:11,380
You're not supposed to do that.
And that's apparently one of the things 

3452
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:11,380
that causes hemorrhoid long dumps.
So then.

3453
02:30:11,380 --> 02:30:14,000
But that preparation h is a motherfucker
too because one day have that cleared it

3454
02:30:14,001 --> 02:30:15,180
right up really,
really quick.

3455
02:30:15,480 --> 02:30:16,730
Get the cooling.
The cool ranch.

3456
02:30:16,731 --> 02:30:21,731
When are the cool ranch sense?
Smell refreshing.

3457
02:30:23,950 --> 02:30:26,000
Find out people are like putting it on 
food.

3458
02:30:26,001 --> 02:30:29,480
You can eat that sir.
Tastes just like a preparation.

3459
02:30:29,481 --> 02:30:31,560
H management preparation.
H was totally edible.

3460
02:30:32,870 --> 02:30:34,850
Whatever it does it,
it really works.

3461
02:30:34,851 --> 02:30:39,851
Good at uh,
fixing any sort of a hemorrhoid 

3462
02:30:39,851 --> 02:30:41,240
situation and got down there.
They went away like within a day.

3463
02:30:41,840 --> 02:30:46,840
But man for fucking days,
four days of totally untrustworthy 

3464
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:46,840
shits.
Drip.

3465
02:30:46,840 --> 02:30:49,550
The pasty shit where it's like you could
spread it on brick.

3466
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:51,410
Oh,
I can spread it stuff.

3467
02:30:51,500 --> 02:30:56,500
Yeah,
it was like leaves in there and shit 

3468
02:30:56,500 --> 02:30:56,500
because I still eat healthy,
but it was like a lot of liquid.

3469
02:30:56,500 --> 02:30:59,330
It was some sort of a stomach bug,
whatever it was.

3470
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:01,940
Um,
I don't have any idea where it came from

3471
02:31:01,941 --> 02:31:05,660
food or whether it came from just 
catching a cold and you know,

3472
02:31:05,661 --> 02:31:08,000
that this cold manifests itself as a 
stomach bug,

3473
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,800
but whatever it was,
man,

3474
02:31:09,801 --> 02:31:12,320
it was crazy for a few days and I felt 
real weak.

3475
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:17,560
Like I'd go to pull my bow back and it 
was kind of difficult to pull the bow 

3476
02:31:17,560 --> 02:31:18,670
back because you're weak from stumping.
Yeah.

3477
02:31:18,770 --> 02:31:22,080
And people use it that I was weak.
I was weak.

3478
02:31:22,110 --> 02:31:23,980
Like I would like pick things from not 
having it.

3479
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:24,840
Yeah,
I could feel it.

3480
02:31:24,860 --> 02:31:26,220
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3481
02:31:26,221 --> 02:31:28,650
Definitely dehydrated.
But also just I wasn't eating right.

3482
02:31:28,680 --> 02:31:31,440
Like I scared no,
I wasn't getting hungry either.

3483
02:31:32,100 --> 02:31:36,030
I mean I was eating bright in that I was
having like lettuce and salads and stuff

3484
02:31:36,031 --> 02:31:37,530
like that,
but I wasn't eating very much.

3485
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:41,430
I wasn't eating like a light meals 
during the day because my stomach was so

3486
02:31:41,431 --> 02:31:46,431
untrustworthy.
Is that when that happened with 

3487
02:31:46,431 --> 02:31:46,431
diarrhea?
What is it?

3488
02:31:46,431 --> 02:31:46,431
What's happening?
I don't know man,

3489
02:31:46,431 --> 02:31:47,730
but whatever it was just adjusting.
It's just too much.

3490
02:31:47,790 --> 02:31:51,080
I would eat like a steak.
I would have steak and some salad and it

3491
02:31:51,081 --> 02:31:55,020
would turn into water.
How to stake in a salad become.

3492
02:31:55,110 --> 02:32:00,110
I mean my,
my body was liquefying it and it would 

3493
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:01,020
come out just whoa.
What is that?

3494
02:32:01,050 --> 02:32:05,340
That's too much stomach acid.
That just breaking down everything and I

3495
02:32:05,341 --> 02:32:06,210
don't know the,
the,

3496
02:32:06,390 --> 02:32:09,420
the process.
I should probably know that shit on your

3497
02:32:09,421 --> 02:32:10,710
hand a little bit.
Sort of smelled it.

3498
02:32:10,711 --> 02:32:12,920
Right.
And see if there's some on it.

3499
02:32:12,930 --> 02:32:16,580
Enzymes on enzymes.
It's all been a dietician on it.

3500
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:21,630
That's how it got me out of it.
I just had to do the time.

3501
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:23,490
I just had to let my body process at 
times.

3502
02:32:23,491 --> 02:32:25,530
You just drink a lot of water.
Put in the reps?

3503
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:26,150
Yeah,
it was.

3504
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:28,580
I was definitely thinking that I was 
probably getting dehydrated from.

3505
02:32:28,600 --> 02:32:30,360
I was like,
so much water's coming out of my ass,

3506
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:32,970
like I better make sure I drink a lot to
go with it.

3507
02:32:33,380 --> 02:32:35,190
All right.
Does your hemorrhoid when it happens,

3508
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:38,230
do you even feel the hemorrhage?
Because I still feel that.

3509
02:32:38,231 --> 02:32:39,060
I feel like it's like,
oh,

3510
02:32:39,061 --> 02:32:44,061
I still have.
There's still some stuff I gotta wipe 

3511
02:32:44,061 --> 02:32:44,061
off really?
Like oh,

3512
02:32:44,061 --> 02:32:46,980
that's just not just my mind.
Just a little while my bleeds because 

3513
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:52,250
like a giant of that's just my ass now.
That's my shit right there.

3514
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:54,840
It feels like what leads out?
It doesn't even feel anything.

3515
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:57,730
It just lets that will.
That exploded inside,

3516
02:32:57,930 --> 02:32:58,670
isn't it?
Anyway,

3517
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:59,520
inside.
I don't even feel it.

3518
02:32:59,521 --> 02:33:04,521
Mindset.
Mine's on the rest of their diet that 

3519
02:33:04,521 --> 02:33:05,440
you can take.
That stops that from happening.

3520
02:33:05,441 --> 02:33:10,441
I probably stopped finding foods broken.
Jack's lodge up inside your anal binding

3521
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:18,920
foods.
Stay away from them or you eat a lot of 

3522
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:18,920
them.
I forget what it is.

3523
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:18,920
Oh,
well you should probably know.

3524
02:33:18,920 --> 02:33:20,160
It's one of those two.
So rice was in that group.

3525
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:23,250
Binding food,
eat or dale away from them or keep eat.

3526
02:33:23,251 --> 02:33:26,130
A lot of them don't really go by the 
regimen,

3527
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:29,910
but if you do do that,
it would help prevent hemorrhoids.

3528
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:31,920
Um,
yes,

3529
02:33:32,370 --> 02:33:33,510
that's my doctors don't where they got 
it.

3530
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:38,630
And um,
that's the 19th to eat a lot of solid 

3531
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,630
research.
Um,

3532
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:38,630
yeah.
Yeah.

3533
02:33:38,630 --> 02:33:39,300
Does that help at all?

3534
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:44,480
I don't know.
I feel like it makes you ship more 

3535
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:44,480
often.
Yeah.

3536
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:44,480
But if you,
um,

3537
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:45,190
if you doesn't it come out like we need 
a lot of salads.

3538
02:33:45,191 --> 02:33:46,770
It comes out real easy.
Woo.

3539
02:33:46,830 --> 02:33:47,370
Oh,
right.

3540
02:33:47,371 --> 02:33:47,780
Yeah,
that's,

3541
02:33:47,790 --> 02:33:49,620
I guess the scraping,
pushing.

3542
02:33:49,650 --> 02:33:52,950
I used to pray it was so jacket.
Who'd be so jacket?

3543
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,790
She claimed that I prayed to have come 
out because it hurts so bad.

3544
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:57,790
Oh,
that's horrible.

3545
02:33:57,791 --> 02:34:02,791
That was just so inflamed in there 
because I was just wasn't dumping 

3546
02:34:02,791 --> 02:34:02,791
because I knew it'd be bad.
So I was like,

3547
02:34:02,791 --> 02:34:03,480
let me hold it for another few days.
Oh my God.

3548
02:34:03,481 --> 02:34:07,110
Days of dumping compact.
You held off from days.

3549
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:09,140
We could have fun.
That's insane.

3550
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:09,870
Shit.
Every week.

3551
02:34:10,290 --> 02:34:11,790
Dude.
That is so insane.

3552
02:34:12,090 --> 02:34:15,480
That's so insane.
I've never even heard that's toxic.

3553
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:19,330
I guess for sure.
You're containing all that stuff in your

3554
02:34:19,331 --> 02:34:20,980
body that's supposed to be evacuated.

3555
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:22,270
Well,
it's in that spot.

3556
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:25,870
Whatever that spot is.
Not Rubber hit fucking fill up dump,

3557
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:30,480
but it will become too big for my log.
So separate.

3558
02:34:30,510 --> 02:34:32,000
It's like your first time.
No,

3559
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:32,300
no,
no.

3560
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:35,740
Your first time doing anal.
You Fuck Mandingo.

3561
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:41,460
It's like,
that's pretty much what it was my 

3562
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:44,020
asshole.
And it was probably all dried up in 

3563
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:44,020
there.
Right up.

3564
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:44,020
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3565
02:34:44,020 --> 02:34:46,080
Peace.
Jaggedy chunks tearing you apart as you.

3566
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:51,090
Shit.
I would have to reach and sometimes in 

3567
02:34:51,090 --> 02:34:51,090
terror.
Oh,

3568
02:34:51,090 --> 02:34:54,200
you had to do that dog had to get a 
castrated them.

3569
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:55,330
Yeah.
Johnny,

3570
02:34:55,331 --> 02:34:57,670
I need his balls removed because two 
things.

3571
02:34:57,671 --> 02:35:02,671
One,
he had an inflated prostate that was 

3572
02:35:02,671 --> 02:35:05,341
pressing up against his colon and it was
making them constipated and he was uh,

3573
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:10,060
in the,
in the hospital for a over a week.

3574
02:35:10,570 --> 02:35:15,570
I had to bring them in and they had to 
try to figure out how to get him to 

3575
02:35:15,570 --> 02:35:20,011
deprecate because his,
that it was backed up and then they 

3576
02:35:20,011 --> 02:35:20,950
found out the devastation was backed up 
because he was like,

3577
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:22,830
he would like go to [inaudible],
but then he wouldn't,

3578
02:35:22,831 --> 02:35:27,831
he would get on like Fan Dover crouched,
but he couldn't poop and I knew there 

3579
02:35:27,831 --> 02:35:27,831
was something wrong.

3580
02:35:27,831 --> 02:35:29,630
So I brought him in and they found out 
that it was,

3581
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:33,040
his prostate was enlarged and you know,
he's an older male dog.

3582
02:35:33,041 --> 02:35:35,170
He's like seven now.
And so,

3583
02:35:35,171 --> 02:35:36,670
um,
I got them fixed.

3584
02:35:36,730 --> 02:35:41,730
So they take his testicles way,
which makes the prostate decreased to 

3585
02:35:41,730 --> 02:35:42,680
then you've got room to shoot it up.
Yeah,

3586
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,190
I used to,
but some people say that,

3587
02:35:44,191 --> 02:35:45,160
you know,
you should,

3588
02:35:45,161 --> 02:35:50,161
uh,
you should get a dog fixed and it's 

3589
02:35:50,161 --> 02:35:50,161
like,
it's healthier and happier for the dog.

3590
02:35:50,161 --> 02:35:51,250
But I had a veterinarian didn't agree 
with that at all.

3591
02:35:51,251 --> 02:35:54,130
He said it's totally natural for that 
animal to have its testicles.

3592
02:35:54,370 --> 02:35:55,570
He goes,
if the dog is,

3593
02:35:55,690 --> 02:36:00,690
if you,
you don't want them to breed and is a 

3594
02:36:00,690 --> 02:36:03,361
female around,
get the female fixed and it goes and if 

3595
02:36:03,361 --> 02:36:05,440
you want to get the dog fixed you can,
but you don't have to get the dark fix.

3596
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:06,770
And he's like,
if you're not,

3597
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:11,820
you're not making your dog a dad,
like forcing your dog to have to breed 

3598
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:16,501
and make unwanted puppies.
If you're not being irresponsible with 

3599
02:36:16,501 --> 02:36:16,501
the dogs.
Sexuality,

3600
02:36:16,501 --> 02:36:18,760
like you don't have to get the dog.
Can you just get into the secondary one?

3601
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:22,150
If it cut the balls off,
let it still fuck doggy condoms.

3602
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:23,710
Yeah.
Because you don't want that.

3603
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:28,440
You don't want that swelling.
It's the swelling that comes from the,

3604
02:36:28,441 --> 02:36:29,950
uh,
the testicles and the,

3605
02:36:29,951 --> 02:36:34,951
uh,
the enlargement of the prostate that 

3606
02:36:34,951 --> 02:36:35,320
happens as they get older and that can 
be alleviated by castrating the dog.

3607
02:36:35,800 --> 02:36:37,540
So the people get that.
I don't know.

3608
02:36:37,541 --> 02:36:38,890
I'm sure they do.
Humans were like,

3609
02:36:38,891 --> 02:36:40,750
I'm done fucking 72,
you know,

3610
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:43,120
just come into my balls off.
I'm sure people do.

3611
02:36:43,180 --> 02:36:44,560
I'm sure there's people who have done 
that.

3612
02:36:44,770 --> 02:36:49,770
I'm sure there's people who have just 
been tired of being a prisoner to their 

3613
02:36:49,770 --> 02:36:50,740
cock and balls and just fucking son of a
bitch.

3614
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:53,470
You run me for the last time.
We're done.

3615
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,730
Hold them in your hand for sure.
People have done that.

3616
02:36:58,090 --> 02:36:59,710
Cut your balls off.
Oh yeah.

3617
02:37:00,310 --> 02:37:03,820
People have done it with rubber bands.
The Maori tribe was big into that.

3618
02:37:03,821 --> 02:37:06,850
That's how you showed up.
Might by cutting your bolts off in front

3619
02:37:06,851 --> 02:37:08,620
of people.
Oh my God.

3620
02:37:08,650 --> 02:37:10,030
That's the dumbest thing I've ever 
heard.

3621
02:37:10,450 --> 02:37:15,450
Oh,
that's why they didn't take over the 

3622
02:37:15,450 --> 02:37:15,450
world.
Maybe that can't be true.

3623
02:37:15,450 --> 02:37:16,010
I just made it up,
but it was like you son

3624
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:18,760
of a bitch.
Yeah,

3625
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:19,880
they're.
They're fierce warriors.

3626
02:37:19,881 --> 02:37:24,881
They know the power of the balls.
They wouldn't cut the balls off like 

3627
02:37:24,881 --> 02:37:26,180
they do tattoo their faces.
That's what I tell you about goofing off

3628
02:37:26,181 --> 02:37:29,090
over there.
Giggling and laughing and distracting.

3629
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:31,940
I'm looking at your.
The message board and people are posting

3630
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:36,450
tweets of his poops.
Once you pooped in awhile,

3631
02:37:36,520 --> 02:37:38,490
just have your pool.
Let's see.

3632
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:39,260
No,
no,

3633
02:37:39,261 --> 02:37:41,400
no.
I don't want to show some of the notable

3634
02:37:41,401 --> 02:37:43,490
ones.
Really notable ones,

3635
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:49,000
you eat too many gummy bears and I 
pooped and there was just like river of 

3636
02:37:50,451 --> 02:37:53,660
like red inside the poop.
It was a massive poop.

3637
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:56,300
Just running red in light but like so 
thick.

3638
02:37:56,350 --> 02:37:58,070
Do you know you're addicted to sugar,
right?

3639
02:37:58,100 --> 02:37:59,100
Yeah.
You know about all that?

3640
02:37:59,110 --> 02:38:04,110
I do know it shouldn't be sold in places
you need to stop drinking and eating it 

3641
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:04,460
and chewing on it,
but no,

3642
02:38:04,461 --> 02:38:05,420
we need to get to the source.

3643
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:08,420
And why is it addictive?
Substance just allowed to be in front of

3644
02:38:08,460 --> 02:38:10,160
children.
Habits out of it.

3645
02:38:10,310 --> 02:38:15,310
I agree.
In some ways they make laws about 

3646
02:38:15,310 --> 02:38:17,801
cigarettes because I know it's so 
damaging because not supposed to have 

3647
02:38:17,801 --> 02:38:17,801
that before.
Until you're 18,

3648
02:38:17,801 --> 02:38:20,690
I'll sugar because it's delicious and 
you've ruined.

3649
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,520
Ruined kids.
Good time.

3650
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:27,580
I Guess Sugar and candy and I says 
because in my day it wasn't done that 

3651
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:27,580
way.
Hey,

3652
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:27,580
I'm addicted now.
I'm an adult.

3653
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:29,940
You look at an addict.
No,

3654
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:31,730
you are.
I know you are.

3655
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:34,980
I've seen you chew that candy.
Eat that gum,

3656
02:38:35,290 --> 02:38:38,870
not fat metabolism and are watching my 
weight.

3657
02:38:39,690 --> 02:38:44,690
He got for awhile.
Are you lost a bunch of weight at one 

3658
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:44,690
time?
Right?

3659
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:44,750
How much you lose?
Two pounds.

3660
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:46,340
Fifty or 60 pounds.
That's amazing.

3661
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:48,110
I was to 40.
What'd you do to lose it?

3662
02:38:48,380 --> 02:38:50,360
Just say healthy.
Just decided.

3663
02:38:50,361 --> 02:38:50,570
All right.

3664
02:38:50,570 --> 02:38:51,310
Enough for this.
Well,

3665
02:38:51,311 --> 02:38:53,720
I said I used to do these personal 
challenges for myself.

3666
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:58,930
Like uh,
the first year of college we've got our 

3667
02:38:58,930 --> 02:38:58,930
report card we got are not online,
just like gave it to us.

3668
02:38:58,930 --> 02:39:03,371
So I see.
I see if I could go for a week just 

3669
02:39:03,371 --> 02:39:03,371
leaving it in my pocket with me without 
checking it.

3670
02:39:03,371 --> 02:39:04,820
You know,
you really want to know your grades.

3671
02:39:05,230 --> 02:39:06,470
Just these tests.
Ooh,

3672
02:39:06,471 --> 02:39:07,130
I liked that.
Yeah.

3673
02:39:07,131 --> 02:39:09,290
I went a week without lying.
Trying not to lie at all.

3674
02:39:09,640 --> 02:39:11,540
Whoa.
Got thrown out of the deployment.

3675
02:39:11,720 --> 02:39:13,520
Just do it.
It's so difficult.

3676
02:39:13,550 --> 02:39:16,310
Why?
I mean zero tolerance truck.

3677
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:17,450
See it.
It's just.

3678
02:39:17,480 --> 02:39:22,480
I mean,
you don't go a day without lying 

3679
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:22,480
multiple times.
That's interesting.

3680
02:39:22,480 --> 02:39:23,830
I never even thought of.
So I had this problem when I took,

3681
02:39:23,860 --> 02:39:28,860
I took the journalism entry school.
You have to take a typing test and will 

3682
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:28,860
be at 25 words a minute.

3683
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:30,170
I just got back from Israel so I hadn't 
really tight much.

3684
02:39:30,171 --> 02:39:32,080
I was at 21,
22,

3685
02:39:32,300 --> 02:39:33,170
took it twice,
couldn't get it.

3686
02:39:33,171 --> 02:39:38,171
So I got my roommate,
my jumper,

3687
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:40,250
Asian roommate,
and he was like,

3688
02:39:40,251 --> 02:39:41,000
Hey,
take the test for me.

3689
02:39:41,001 --> 02:39:43,330
Here's my alternative is my social 
security number from.

3690
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:45,800
I don't do that good.
But he's got like 65 words a minute.

3691
02:39:46,420 --> 02:39:51,420
Yeah.
So when I went to register for a 

3692
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:51,420
journalism class that next year,
they're like,

3693
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:52,490
hey,
how come there's a block there?

3694
02:39:52,491 --> 02:39:55,910
Just want to know what you go from like 
20 words a minute to like 65.

3695
02:39:56,390 --> 02:40:00,170
And it was like,
because I had someone check the test for

3696
02:40:00,171 --> 02:40:02,730
me and they're like,
what?

3697
02:40:04,400 --> 02:40:06,080
You were fucking around the first time.
And I was like,

3698
02:40:06,530 --> 02:40:11,530
no.
I had someone take the test for me who 

3699
02:40:11,530 --> 02:40:12,000
was better than me.
Like you can't ever come to this.

3700
02:40:12,310 --> 02:40:15,090
The journalism like you're out forever.
Forever.

3701
02:40:16,240 --> 02:40:18,510
Try not line for a week.
You saw the pitch?

3702
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:19,830
Yes.
Wait,

3703
02:40:19,831 --> 02:40:24,831
what did I say in the beginning?
What was the thing I do for personal 

3704
02:40:24,831 --> 02:40:24,831
challenges?
Yeah,

3705
02:40:24,831 --> 02:40:25,680
but what was the food dropping weight?
Oh yeah.

3706
02:40:25,681 --> 02:40:28,020
So I just saw if I could eat healthy for
a week and I meant like note,

3707
02:40:28,021 --> 02:40:29,940
note sodium,
low sodium foods to.

3708
02:40:30,530 --> 02:40:34,410
But I just shattered pounds.
Just sort of like,

3709
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:35,010
you know,
meat,

3710
02:40:35,011 --> 02:40:36,480
beef,
little things.

3711
02:40:36,481 --> 02:40:36,900
Just,
you know,

3712
02:40:36,901 --> 02:40:38,310
what healthy is?
Eat the healthy stuff.

3713
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:39,780
Yeah.
You know what that is.

3714
02:40:39,781 --> 02:40:40,620
Storefront.
I don't be like,

3715
02:40:40,621 --> 02:40:42,510
well it's got some soy sauce.
Just keep fucking,

3716
02:40:42,511 --> 02:40:46,860
you know what healthy is so nonspecific,
so it's not healthy,

3717
02:40:47,350 --> 02:40:48,540
you know,
non.

3718
02:40:48,541 --> 02:40:50,800
Totally nonspecific.
You didn't just stay healthy.

3719
02:40:51,020 --> 02:40:54,220
Dropped a shitload of weight.
Now I must have a high metabolism to do.

3720
02:40:54,290 --> 02:40:55,050
Eat a lot of candy.

3721
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:57,720
I do a lot of junk food.
I'll have a nice meal during the day and

3722
02:40:57,721 --> 02:41:02,721
then at night I'll go nuts.
And what kind of exercise you do and 

3723
02:41:02,721 --> 02:41:02,721
these days,
a lot of walking around,

3724
02:41:02,721 --> 02:41:07,011
some hiking.
I went on some hiking in Phoenix on a 

3725
02:41:07,011 --> 02:41:07,011
mountain,
walked all the way up,

3726
02:41:07,011 --> 02:41:09,020
made an instagram collide.
Yeah man.

3727
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:12,320
Like a real chip does.
How did you instagram collages?

3728
02:41:12,360 --> 02:41:15,240
Fixed dish?
It's a new programs and new APP.

3729
02:41:15,320 --> 02:41:20,320
You just,
there's not even new making collages 

3730
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:21,090
like chicks because I want to do an 
instagram picture,

3731
02:41:21,091 --> 02:41:23,610
but no,
no one picture looking now joe,

3732
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:28,680
he's scratching,
stitch fix stitch and then it just makes

3733
02:41:29,131 --> 02:41:31,200
you feel what you're saying.
I see s,

3734
02:41:31,201 --> 02:41:33,750
T I C H O.
Okay.

3735
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:36,450
Pic Stitch your stitching pick six.
Stitch.

3736
02:41:36,451 --> 02:41:37,700
Yeah.
And they have all these different.

3737
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:40,150
Um,
you can do four pictures altogether.

3738
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,740
All different templates.

3739
02:41:43,980 --> 02:41:46,770
Hilarious.
You're a girl with her up in New York.

3740
02:41:46,771 --> 02:41:48,440
Did that to,
you know,

3741
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,010
I did that in Switzerland when I was.
Oh yeah.

3742
02:41:50,011 --> 02:41:52,800
I guess I was after a just outdoorsy 
stuff.

3743
02:41:53,480 --> 02:41:56,760
Looks really good in New York.
New York has its very specific accents.

3744
02:41:56,761 --> 02:42:01,761
Right.
Have you ever noticed that like tech 

3745
02:42:01,761 --> 02:42:04,701
people have sort of their own accent?
Interesting from speaking the same 

3746
02:42:04,701 --> 02:42:05,370
language all the time?
Yes.

3747
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:10,290
Then there's a thing,
there's a kind of thing that they do,

3748
02:42:10,620 --> 02:42:13,250
you know,
this sort of silicon valley,

3749
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:15,180
they all talk like the downstairs 
neighbors from,

3750
02:42:15,181 --> 02:42:16,070
uh,
from uh,

3751
02:42:16,470 --> 02:42:19,200
moving on up what's really cool times 
they all have.

3752
02:42:19,201 --> 02:42:22,350
This is a weird sort of aspect to the 
way they talk.

3753
02:42:22,351 --> 02:42:27,351
It's very tech like he's like,
this is like a very like specific sort 

3754
02:42:27,351 --> 02:42:30,080
of Jefferson downstairs white neighbor 
from the Jeffersons.

3755
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:31,880
That's how they talk.
Yeah.

3756
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:36,170
Palo Alto.
It was a very like up,

3757
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:39,060
not like a pot pitched,
but just like uppity.

3758
02:42:39,330 --> 02:42:44,330
I was listening to these two guys that 
were tech guys talking about this House 

3759
02:42:44,330 --> 02:42:45,810
that this one guy was buying and you 
know,

3760
02:42:46,100 --> 02:42:51,100
they were talking like mortgages and 
interest rates and all this different 

3761
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:51,540
shit,
but they were talking like in Techie guy

3762
02:42:51,600 --> 02:42:53,790
accents and I was like thinking.
I was like,

3763
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:58,440
I guarantee you these guys are involved 
in some way in technology,

3764
02:42:58,441 --> 02:43:03,441
some in some way or a part of it in some
way and then they start talking about 

3765
02:43:03,441 --> 02:43:03,750
their job and they weren't.
They were,

3766
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:04,800
yeah.
Yeah.

3767
02:43:04,801 --> 02:43:07,250
Me and Palo Alto,
the people just looked different.

3768
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:09,860
They carry themselves differently.
Biking around,

3769
02:43:09,870 --> 02:43:11,260
I'll just different.
Well,

3770
02:43:11,261 --> 02:43:12,490
there they're definitely,

3771
02:43:12,490 --> 02:43:14,140
there's some really fucking smart 
people.

3772
02:43:14,830 --> 02:43:19,830
Really smart and the amount of money 
that it costs to live up there with 

3773
02:43:19,830 --> 02:43:19,900
Xeloda.
All the houses were like,

3774
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:21,630
what would it cost to live here?
And then just like saw,

3775
02:43:21,650 --> 02:43:24,090
I want to see a regular house and it's 
$3.

3776
02:43:24,091 --> 02:43:24,880
Million to million.
Yeah,

3777
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:29,881
absolutely.
That's a regular house story house 

3778
02:43:29,881 --> 02:43:31,330
that's supposed to be $400,000.
It's not supposed to be 3 million.

3779
02:43:31,331 --> 02:43:34,000
Like you're crazy.
That can't be that much money.

3780
02:43:34,001 --> 02:43:35,830
That doesn't make any sense.
The whole house,

3781
02:43:35,831 --> 02:43:38,140
all the electricity runs off.
They're like breaths.

3782
02:43:38,380 --> 02:43:42,190
Anti-Tech protesters invade Kevin Rosa,
San Francisco neighborhood.

3783
02:43:42,550 --> 02:43:44,790
Kevin rose parasite.
Who's cutting road?

3784
02:43:44,810 --> 02:43:45,610
How is he a parasite?

3785
02:43:46,210 --> 02:43:47,620
Yeah.
These people in his neighborhood,

3786
02:43:47,621 --> 02:43:49,780
they're not fans of Kevin rose and it 
was Kevin rose.

3787
02:43:49,870 --> 02:43:53,140
Kevin rose is the creator of dig a or 
where the creators,

3788
02:43:53,150 --> 02:43:57,310
a dig tech,
techie guy revision all of that stuff.

3789
02:43:57,311 --> 02:43:57,600
Screening.

3790
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:59,970
What are they saying?
What's their argument against him?

3791
02:44:00,210 --> 02:44:01,990
Uh,
this is the letter.

3792
02:44:01,991 --> 02:44:03,400
It says,
greetings your neighbor at Blah Blah,

3793
02:44:03,401 --> 02:44:05,740
blah is a man named Kevin Rose sees a 
parasite to her.

3794
02:44:05,741 --> 02:44:08,350
Prenupt perhaps not a view,
but of us.

3795
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:10,180
This is why we're here to reveal it for 
him.

3796
02:44:10,210 --> 02:44:13,780
And you're saying that he's a partner.
Capitalists at Google ventures.

3797
02:44:13,781 --> 02:44:17,800
Kevin directs the flow of capital from 
Google into the tech startup bubble that

3798
02:44:17,801 --> 02:44:21,370
is destroying San Francisco,
so it's against technology

3799
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:24,900
startups that he funds.
I can't read this.

3800
02:44:24,920 --> 02:44:26,920
They make more money.
What is it?

3801
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:28,090
It's just so blurry.

3802
02:44:28,290 --> 02:44:31,300
Yeah.
A W says,

3803
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:36,480
bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs 
that have ravaged the landscapes of San 

3804
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:38,050
Francisco and Oakland.
Okay,

3805
02:44:38,051 --> 02:44:43,051
so it's.
It's anti the young smart people that 

3806
02:44:43,051 --> 02:44:43,051
have money.
Yeah.

3807
02:44:43,051 --> 02:44:44,090
Let's look at this line four times a.

3808
02:44:44,820 --> 02:44:48,040
We are the ones who serve them coffee,
deliver their food,

3809
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:49,240
suck their cock.

3810
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:50,990
Wow.

3811
02:44:51,050 --> 02:44:56,050
Laura's.
Nearly all of them are just like Kevin 

3812
02:44:56,050 --> 02:44:56,050
rose and we're tired of this miserable 
and the city

3813
02:44:56,140 --> 02:44:58,630
suck their cocks.
They put suck their cocks in it.

3814
02:44:58,631 --> 02:45:00,160
Yep.
That's hilarious.

3815
02:45:00,220 --> 02:45:05,220
That is funny.
So even their fucking protesters were 

3816
02:45:05,220 --> 02:45:06,460
smarter.
San Francisco is such a great place.

3817
02:45:06,461 --> 02:45:08,980
Definitely need to figure out a way to 
keep the diversity,

3818
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:11,680
etc.
That we need to solve.

3819
02:45:11,740 --> 02:45:12,650
Rising runs.
CuTe.

3820
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:17,970
Sepa,
san francisco's and crackdown on 

3821
02:45:17,970 --> 02:45:17,970
landlords booting folks out.
Oh yeah,

3822
02:45:17,970 --> 02:45:18,520
they do because all the cool 
neighborhoods now,

3823
02:45:18,521 --> 02:45:19,510
there's so much money.
They're like,

3824
02:45:19,511 --> 02:45:22,960
well we can charge more and get rid of.
And so they have the gentrification,

3825
02:45:22,961 --> 02:45:24,550
which just means white people are here 
now.

3826
02:45:25,090 --> 02:45:30,090
Um,
I now know like they don't have that 

3827
02:45:30,090 --> 02:45:30,220
degenerate feel anymore.
The hate of just doing what you want.

3828
02:45:30,950 --> 02:45:31,460
Yeah.
I,

3829
02:45:32,710 --> 02:45:34,990
I find it fascinating.
Just as a,

3830
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:40,180
a natuRal event was the same way.
You can't find a place in williamsburg 

3831
02:45:40,180 --> 02:45:44,251
to rent.
it used to be like the thing you did 

3832
02:45:44,251 --> 02:45:44,950
because it was like cool,
but now it's like rents are too high.

3833
02:45:44,950 --> 02:45:47,350
Everyone knew where he got out.
Isn't that fascinating though?

3834
02:45:47,470 --> 02:45:49,270
It's fascinating when things like that 
happen,

3835
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:53,760
like when you see a house like in san 
francisco and it's $3,000,000,000

3836
02:45:53,830 --> 02:45:55,840
and you go,
what the fuck are you talking about?

3837
02:45:55,841 --> 02:46:00,841
And then you try to figure out what are 
you getting out of this 3 million bucks 

3838
02:46:00,841 --> 02:46:00,841
location.
That's it.

3839
02:46:00,841 --> 02:46:05,190
Like that house is not a god damn 3 
million downloads to somewhere else 

3840
02:46:05,190 --> 02:46:08,551
beCause they'll want to go somewhere 
else and it moves like the way deserts 

3841
02:46:08,551 --> 02:46:08,560
move over,
like high speed of of years.

3842
02:46:08,561 --> 02:46:10,520
A year or Second.
Cisco's fucking great though,

3843
02:46:10,521 --> 02:46:14,210
man.
It is a great pretty cool city.

3844
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:18,950
The people are cool as fuck I,
I really appreciate it up there a lot.

3845
02:46:19,230 --> 02:46:21,930
He iS cold.
We love seeing everybody with us.

3846
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:26,940
San Francisco hoodies that they're all 
buying because everybody gets there and 

3847
02:46:26,940 --> 02:46:26,940
it.
It'll be warm and I'm warm.

3848
02:46:26,940 --> 02:46:29,930
You're right by the ocean.
It can be fucking brutal.

3849
02:46:30,170 --> 02:46:32,120
It's more than that.
It's cold.

3850
02:46:32,300 --> 02:46:37,300
What's the wet?
That's all it is because it doesn't get 

3851
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:37,300
cold like Alaska cold.
It gets cold.

3852
02:46:37,300 --> 02:46:38,990
It gets way colder than santa monica.
Yeah.

3853
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:41,750
It gets into that.
It snowed when I lived there.

3854
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:45,680
They say october is the only warm month,
but it was only once but it's node.

3855
02:46:46,470 --> 02:46:47,900
Um,
yeah.

3856
02:46:47,901 --> 02:46:48,830
I can't.
It gets,

3857
02:46:48,860 --> 02:46:51,050
you know,
even when it's summertime sometimes it's

3858
02:46:51,051 --> 02:46:56,051
good.
I went from june or july and it was 

3859
02:46:56,051 --> 02:46:58,271
like,
it warms up a little bit during the day 

3860
02:46:58,271 --> 02:47:00,941
and then cold.
But if you just live like a half hour 

3861
02:47:00,941 --> 02:47:01,250
away,
you like five,

3862
02:47:01,251 --> 02:47:02,430
10 degrees warmer.
Yeah,

3863
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:07,500
it's weird.
San francisco is just some strange 

3864
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:07,500
valley here.
Right over the hill.

3865
02:47:07,500 --> 02:47:10,550
I mean you drive 15 minutes and it's 25 
degrees hotter or.

3866
02:47:10,551 --> 02:47:12,050
Yeah.
Or going the opposite.

3867
02:47:12,050 --> 02:47:14,340
Going to malibu.
Nice.

3868
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:15,200
Yeah.
Yeah,

3869
02:47:15,510 --> 02:47:16,820
I understand it.
It worked.

3870
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:17,750
People complain about the heat.
I'm like,

3871
02:47:17,751 --> 02:47:19,610
it was like 80,
like fucking where you live.

3872
02:47:20,080 --> 02:47:20,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

3873
02:47:20,930 --> 02:47:23,010
You were in hollywood unbearable.
Yeah.

3874
02:47:23,020 --> 02:47:24,500
You're catching the breeze off the 
ocean.

3875
02:47:24,501 --> 02:47:27,530
Still still cool and stuff off.
That's where I live in west la too,

3876
02:47:27,531 --> 02:47:29,780
is even closer that breeze off the 
ocean.

3877
02:47:29,781 --> 02:47:31,790
So nice man.
The other day,

3878
02:47:31,791 --> 02:47:36,791
um,
I was coming home from the airport and 

3879
02:47:36,791 --> 02:47:37,130
the traffic is bad,
so I decided to take a take the pch.

3880
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:41,460
I just started to get off of the highway
and just take some street roads.

3881
02:47:41,660 --> 02:47:43,820
I tOok the pch over near malibu and I 
was like,

3882
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:45,350
god damn,
it's beautiful here.

3883
02:47:46,010 --> 02:47:47,660
I always wonder if I could live there 
though.

3884
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:53,450
You don't have that dispensers nonstop.
Like I'm living so close to the ocean 

3885
02:47:54,501 --> 02:47:57,650
and then one day that earthquake tsunami
thing kind of just tear me up.

3886
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:00,140
That's one way to look at it,
but I mean,

3887
02:48:00,141 --> 02:48:01,100
look,
let's be honest.

3888
02:48:01,101 --> 02:48:06,101
If the slept with both those earthworks.
If the big earthquake happens right now 

3889
02:48:06,101 --> 02:48:06,650
while we're in the studio,
we're kind of fucked.

3890
02:48:06,710 --> 02:48:11,710
you know,
most of the time you're driving away 

3891
02:48:11,710 --> 02:48:11,780
from your house or you're not at home 
when you're somewhere else.

3892
02:48:12,060 --> 02:48:17,060
You'd want to be on a cliff.
We definitely don't want to be near the 

3893
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:17,390
water.
You don't want to be near the water.

3894
02:48:17,391 --> 02:48:22,391
You might be wanting to be on a cliff 
better than you want to be on the wall 

3895
02:48:22,391 --> 02:48:22,940
and hope it goes inland.
ended up malibu creek state park,

3896
02:48:23,090 --> 02:48:28,090
like a camping area is beautiful and 
just once you get over that first 

3897
02:48:28,090 --> 02:48:28,430
mountain wilderness,
unbelievable.

3898
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:30,530
That's orange.
It's really beautiful.

3899
02:48:30,920 --> 02:48:35,920
Yeah,
but I don't know if it's like a 

3900
02:48:35,920 --> 02:48:39,011
convenient place to live and there's a 
lot of flaky people that bring their 

3901
02:48:39,011 --> 02:48:39,110
dogs everywhere in malibu.

3902
02:48:39,200 --> 02:48:41,660
oh really?
Is that thing going on where you go to a

3903
02:48:41,661 --> 02:48:43,130
restaurant?
People bring their dogs in.

3904
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:44,720
What's going on?
I know there is,

3905
02:48:44,750 --> 02:48:49,750
but I know when you walked on the beach,
everyone just nods and smiles at each 

3906
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:49,750
other.
Like doing well.

3907
02:48:49,750 --> 02:48:49,750
Right.
You're too young.

3908
02:48:49,870 --> 02:48:54,870
You're in malibu.
Even if could just visiting and doing 

3909
02:48:54,870 --> 02:48:54,870
great.
I hadn't been to santa barbara,

3910
02:48:56,480 --> 02:48:57,220
santa barbara.
Sweet.

3911
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:57,770
Oh,
there.

3912
02:48:57,771 --> 02:48:59,120
I'm there in santa barbara.
uh,

3913
02:48:59,121 --> 02:49:04,121
May 2nd.
I'm at the lobero theater with joey 

3914
02:49:04,121 --> 02:49:04,121
diaz.
Um,

3915
02:49:04,121 --> 02:49:04,121
yeah,
it's far,

3916
02:49:04,121 --> 02:49:07,250
but it's only an hour from like say,
um,

3917
02:49:08,550 --> 02:49:11,010
if you went from calabasas it would take
about an hour.

3918
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:13,440
IT takes about an hour to get there.
Drive at night,

3919
02:49:13,710 --> 02:49:16,710
super fast.
If you went from la and it's great,

3920
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:17,670
but when you go like,
oh,

3921
02:49:17,671 --> 02:49:20,700
let's go to the beach right now.
It's nice out like fucking hour 10.

3922
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:22,050
Yeah.
From hollywood.

3923
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,730
Yeah.
May second and lobero theater.

3924
02:49:23,900 --> 02:49:27,990
I'm kind of from a couple of days.
There's a few tickets left,

3925
02:49:27,991 --> 02:49:29,310
I think.
Not much.

3926
02:49:29,400 --> 02:49:30,630
Santa barbara,
you never played there.

3927
02:49:30,940 --> 02:49:35,940
Played there before.
Me and duncan and joey did it last year 

3928
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,180
or two years ago.
Used to be one of those runs those gigs.

3929
02:49:36,181 --> 02:49:38,460
I know he gonzalez would have quality 
for the dollars.

3930
02:49:38,490 --> 02:49:40,920
It's a great town.
The town of santa barbara.

3931
02:49:40,921 --> 02:49:43,800
It's a great town through the grapevine 
that got there at montecito.

3932
02:49:43,801 --> 02:49:46,350
Montecito is incredible.
all those old houses.

3933
02:49:47,160 --> 02:49:48,760
Old town santa barbara.
Yeah.

3934
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:50,040
That's all cool.
It's dope.

3935
02:49:50,310 --> 02:49:53,280
At the beginning of the fighters to 
refineries,

3936
02:49:53,310 --> 02:49:57,390
I said vineries wineries,
wineries are vineries whatever they are.

3937
02:49:57,391 --> 02:49:58,980
Yeah.
Just past that.

3938
02:49:58,981 --> 02:50:00,020
Like soul vein.
Yeah.

3939
02:50:00,060 --> 02:50:02,040
That's not too far out.
Then After that.

3940
02:50:02,041 --> 02:50:03,130
Right.
And how far solving?

3941
02:50:03,650 --> 02:50:08,650
It's about 30 minutes past that.
It's a nice area man who love it up 

3942
02:50:08,650 --> 02:50:08,760
there,
you know,

3943
02:50:08,761 --> 02:50:09,690
san luis obispo.

3944
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:11,730
You ever go there?
Small town,

3945
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:13,380
college town,
but it's great.

3946
02:50:13,710 --> 02:50:16,830
Really cool place.
Like the opposite of that.

3947
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:17,820
Yeah,
it's real.

3948
02:50:17,830 --> 02:50:20,160
It's where a chocolate dell grew up.
Oh really?

3949
02:50:20,161 --> 02:50:21,480
Yeah.
That's where he,

3950
02:50:21,481 --> 02:50:22,970
uh,
went to college.

3951
02:50:23,550 --> 02:50:24,990
Shouldn't say grew up.
I don't know if he grew up there.

3952
02:50:25,140 --> 02:50:27,090
We went to college there,
but uh,

3953
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:29,210
in what?
Where's san luis obispo?

3954
02:50:29,360 --> 02:50:34,360
But it's about another hour plus past 
santa barbara know along the way to san 

3955
02:50:35,641 --> 02:50:40,641
francisco,
which is a great a comedy festival 

3956
02:50:40,641 --> 02:50:40,641
there.
Know san luis obispo comedy festival.

3957
02:50:40,641 --> 02:50:42,570
Easily slow fest.
Like who did that?

3958
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,850
Who put that together?
I think maybe christian spicer,

3959
02:50:44,851 --> 02:50:46,410
maybe somebody else.
It's a small one,

3960
02:50:46,411 --> 02:50:47,440
but it's.
They do whatever here.

3961
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:52,460
It's been like three or four years.
They get good comments if you done it 

3962
02:50:52,460 --> 02:50:53,220
[inaudible] it's a little like the 
comments a little like below.

3963
02:50:53,430 --> 02:50:55,230
Below that.
That's interesting.

3964
02:50:55,230 --> 02:50:58,170
And what do they perform in the theater?
They just gigs around,

3965
02:50:58,830 --> 02:50:59,720
you know?
Okay.

3966
02:50:59,950 --> 02:51:01,750
Like little clubs or something like 
whoever.

3967
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:03,420
Like a lot of times it's festivals like 
portland.

3968
02:51:03,421 --> 02:51:04,950
Does it have to like venues will be 
like,

3969
02:51:04,951 --> 02:51:05,930
or austin too.
They're like,

3970
02:51:06,030 --> 02:51:08,780
we'll let our bar code to use for this.
Right.

3971
02:51:08,910 --> 02:51:12,300
That's cool idea.
Idea of comedy festivals are fun,

3972
02:51:12,301 --> 02:51:17,301
man.
I mean I just did this one in south 

3973
02:51:17,301 --> 02:51:19,161
beach and it was comedy central,
put it together and I'd done it once 

3974
02:51:19,161 --> 02:51:23,781
before was guerra.
And the really cool thing about it 

3975
02:51:23,781 --> 02:51:23,781
though is just the hang with all the 
other comics,

3976
02:51:23,781 --> 02:51:24,660
you know,
benson was the,

3977
02:51:24,670 --> 02:51:29,670
we hang out with,
had align with the comment I'm doing 

3978
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:29,670
just for the,
it's like that hotel later.

3979
02:51:29,670 --> 02:51:32,610
It's like all just us hanging out moon.
Terribly cool.

3980
02:51:32,900 --> 02:51:34,230
Same reason.
Yeah.

3981
02:51:34,231 --> 02:51:38,020
That's the big part about it is like 
comedians convention giving to do.

3982
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,600
No one has a meeting.
No one has anything.

3983
02:51:39,690 --> 02:51:41,400
Yeah.
So let's all just go to the wash off and

3984
02:51:41,401 --> 02:51:46,401
have some fun and obliterated late at 
night and everyone is so it does not 

3985
02:51:46,401 --> 02:51:48,120
matter.
Indeed.

3986
02:51:48,270 --> 02:51:49,740
Indeed.
