1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,390
She,
I'm really looking forward to it.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,190
Boom.
And we're live Henry rollins.

3
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:09,170
We are live.
All right.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,000
I like how you do the one year off.
That's what Jim Norton approach.

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,930
He,
he likes that.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,930
You have always done it this way so I 
can hear the room and hear me as well.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,480
Keep your eye on the door.
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:18,330
Yeah.
Little guys.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,350
So listen man,
I heard you on red fears podcast.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,390
Always one of my best friends.
He's a good guy.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,860
I love that guy.
He's funny.

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,890
He is very funny.
We're both doing his thing at that club,

13
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:30,390
right?
We tell the story.

14
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,283
Yes.
And I saw yours and I think I do like 

15
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:34,494
the month after you.
So I saw yours on the Internet and then 

16
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,270
I did one and he's the host and that's 
how I met him.

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,760
This is not happening.
Yeah,

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,660
that's it.
And didn't you guys meet somewhere?

19
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,983
Yeah,
last year in August at the fringe 

20
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:50,811
festival he was doing like 30 nights 
there and I was doing like five and so I

21
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,800
guess the agents said,
Hey,

22
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:53,634
do this thing with the shirt.
And so he met me in the lobby where I 

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,250
was staying and he brought his gear and 
we just did it.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,140
It was cool because there was background
noise.

25
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:04,530
You could tell you it was the hotel 
revelers outside.

26
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,364
I mean the whole,
that whole part of Scotland is full of 

27
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:08,700
people for 30 days.
It's amazing.

28
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,763
Well,
what was amazing is the way you're 

29
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:12,300
living your life,
man.

30
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,770
It's really fascinating.
Oh,

31
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:14,251
thank.
You know.

32
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,084
And this conversation that you guys had,
it really blew me away because you're 

33
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,660
really doing it.
You know what I mean?

34
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,470
Like trying.
Yeah,

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,303
you're really doing it.
Like you pick a spot on a map and you 

36
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:27,150
just fucking go there.

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,193
You don't know anybody there.
You go by yourself and you just fucking 

38
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,520
hang out,
see what happens.

39
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,840
Yeah.
Yeah.

40
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:37,320
And that's usually like sale.
Go to a place like Ulaan bought tour,

41
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,440
Mongolia for like five days or whatever 
for two days.

42
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:45,330
You get a tour guide just so you can get
the history like this museum,

43
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,920
not that one,
this temple,

44
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,420
not those two.
Just whatever.

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,553
And what I was trying to do in a place 
like that is get the tour guide and 

46
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,510
break them.
And I'm like,

47
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,433
okay,
so tell me about the corruption in your 

48
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,960
government.
Well sir,

49
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,190
we don't have any,
ma'am.

50
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,780
I'm going to ask you one more time.
And you know,

51
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,190
by the afternoon they finally submit and
they're like,

52
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,470
okay.
And like when I was in,

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,240
uh,
in Mongolia,

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,130
the woman by the end of the day,
she said,

55
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,661
you know what,
I,

56
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,350
I,
I called this guy,

57
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,460
he's like this total like insurgent,
like rebel guy.

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,170
He wants to meet you.
I'm going to be the translator because,

59
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,053
you know,
he and his guys are starting movements 

60
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,594
in this country to overthrow the 
government and he really wants to meet 

61
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:27,481
you.
I said,

62
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,300
I really want to meet him because 
they're rebelling against the government

63
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:32,850
who's selling out that country for the 
titanium,

64
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:34,020
the copper,
all the mining.

65
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,480
Uh,
I think to some Ivanhoe,

66
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,700
some Canadian extractive from.
Anyway,

67
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,350
we go like an hour out of town to some 
like spy bar where there's like nobody.

68
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,184
And you walk in and I was like,
you must be on the up and up and I sit 

69
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,500
at this table with this guy just because
I was able to take the tour guide and be

70
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,640
like,
tell me everything.

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,013
And I'll do that for a couple of days 
and try and get a real understanding of 

72
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,224
where I am.
And then I just leave the hotel or the 

73
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:58,440
tent,
whatever.

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
I'm staying in with my camera,
my backpack with some water and I just 

75
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,190
start walking.
I go,

76
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,270
well,
here's the street.

77
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,280
Look at that slum where that village or 
that souk or that bizarre and I go.

78
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
And so far all 10 fingers still work.
And I've been to about 100 countries and

79
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:16,504
all seven continents.
And the only times I've almost been 

80
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,460
killed,
which was twice was,

81
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,383
was America by comparison.
The rest of the world has been very 

82
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,904
friendly.
Where were the places where you're 

83
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,493
almost killed in America?
In California a couple of times nearly 

84
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:30,880
stabbed to death.
And uh,

85
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:35,800
a guy shot at me and my friend and he 
killed my friend but didn't kill me.

86
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,230
And so that was a real close,
you know,

87
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:42,700
that's real,
but the rest of the world by comparison,

88
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,330
I was in Pakistan when Butoh was 
assassinated,

89
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,980
she was killed in Rawalpindi.

90
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,813
I was in Islam of odd,
like few miles down the road and I was 

91
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:51,934
there for a week because they are port 
shut down and I went outside every day 

92
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,700
and no one,
they just asked if I was lost,

93
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,534
if I needed help getting back the 
thought it was like a journalist or 

94
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,941
embassy.
I went,

95
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,080
Nah,
I'm just a traveler.

96
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,720
And they said basically,
sorry,

97
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,250
you have to see our country in this 
state.

98
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:06,830
And I'm like,
no,

99
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,230
you know,
I don't get to judge.

100
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,370
And so I,
I've had the travel experiences all over

101
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:17,371
the world where I'm met by just amazing 
generosity and kindness and humility and

102
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,240
informs kind of how I comport myself.
But that's what I try and do.

103
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:22,930
I,
I,

104
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,280
I try to live an eventful life.
Like I,

105
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,114
I work at it.
It's not by chance like you give me six 

106
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,870
weeks off right now.

107
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,290
I'm clear.
I just whip out my high Rez jeff file of

108
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,050
the map of the world and I pick one 
country and go,

109
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:37,120
okay,
then I'll just go east from there.

110
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,880
Like China,
Mongolia,

111
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,140
Bhutan,
Tibet,

112
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,610
Vietnam,
back to La.

113
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,380
I'll just go do that.
I want to get back to this.

114
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,214
But what happened with your friend that 
in California was this same sort of a 

115
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,990
thing where you just wanted to check out
a place?

116
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,681
No,
no,

117
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,514
no,
it,

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,353
we,
we were robbed and the guy started 

119
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,620
shooting and uh,
they,

120
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:59,860
uh,
the guy killed my friend and put shot at

121
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:02,920
me and just missed me very closely,
but that,

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,050
that was a big turning point in my life.
I mean,

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,780
that changed everything for 25 years 
ago.

124
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,093
But uh,
it,

125
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
you know,
it changes everything that you think 

126
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,270
about everything.
I mean it's every,

127
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,104
I think everyone goes through trauma 
like that in their own way because it 

128
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,550
taps into everything you've ever done in
your life beforehand.

129
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,410
Uh,
but that was a,

130
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,900
you know,
not to be crass,

131
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,901
but that was a game changer.
But on the bigger topic of danger,

132
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,130
the world is a dangerous place as you 
know,

133
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,964
but at the same time,
I don't think it's to be feared because 

134
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,680
then you don't get anything done.
I mean,

135
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:40,300
you live in America.
I live in America.

136
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,130
Were the roughest room I've ever been 
in.

137
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,870
I mean we're,
we're a coast to coast,

138
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:45,400
philly's flyer game,
you know,

139
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,400
we are blood and teeth on the ice.
I mean we are because of freedom.

140
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,600
We very free and people just walk up and
smack you.

141
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,200
And I've never been to a country as free
as America.

142
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,240
I've been to countries that way.
More hectic,

143
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,400
like don't get caught outside at night 
like downtown Nairobi or you know,

144
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,950
parts of Russia are kind of scary just 
because they're living hard.

145
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:09,740
But as far as a place where anything can
happen,

146
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,460
America is like easily the hairiest 
place I've ever been.

147
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,830
Day to day.
Baghdad was intense.

148
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:18,140
I was in Iraq for a few days,
but um,

149
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,450
that wasn't real.
I was there on a Uso trip.

150
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,460
So you're just kind of camping out in 
the Green Zone.

151
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,300
What

152
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,133
initiated this crazy thirst for travel,
this wanderlust that you've got 

153
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,930
something you've always had

154
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,860
emanation of things.
When I was young,

155
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:32,694
I was born and raised in Washington dc 
and I lived down the road from the 

156
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,570
National Geographic Museum with the big 
whale in the front and the Smithsonian.

157
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,180
It if whenever there was a snow day,
my mom,

158
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,040
she worked for the government downtown.
She'd like,

159
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,230
I'd get on the bus with her and we'd go 
downtown.

160
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:49,830
I spent the whole day at the Smithsonian
dinosaur bones astronauts.

161
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,250
They all,
you know,

162
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,850
all that kind of stuff.
It was fascinating and my mom would save

163
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:56,820
up her meager pay and she would save up 
for years.

164
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,780
She was like,
art nut.

165
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,830
So we'd go hit the museums in Italy,
go to the museums in France,

166
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,220
go to see all the islands in Greece,
go to England,

167
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,054
see the National Museum,
look at Shakespeare and chaucer his 

168
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,870
handwriting.
And so by the time I was a little kid by

169
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:11,610
11th,
11 years old,

170
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,444
like fifth grade or thereabouts,
I had been to Greece and Italy and 

171
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,310
England and,
and different countries.

172
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,143
And so I kinda wanted more of that.
And when you grow up with National 

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,130
Geographic magazine,
you look at the pyramids,

174
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:26,130
you look at the sinks and you're like,
I want to see that.

175
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,360
Like,
that doesn't look real.

176
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,810
And then eventually I did go to all 
those places.

177
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:31,091
You know,
I,

178
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,300
I stood in front of the stinks more than
once.

179
00:07:33,301 --> 00:07:36,270
And the Great Pyramid in Giza,
it's bigger than you think.

180
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,810
It's like you kinda just,
it hypnotizes you stare at it all day.

181
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,930
Have you been recently?
I haven't been for a few years,

182
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:44,880
but I've been there like three times I 
want to go.

183
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,060
But it's just keep hearing sketchy 
things about Egypt right now.

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,560
Yeah.
Yeah,

185
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,393
it is sketchy.
It'll always be sketchy because their 

186
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,790
GDP is you showing up and going to the 
pyramid.

187
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,120
It's like Las Vegas,
but pyramids like you can see all,

188
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,073
you can see your hotel from the pyramid.
They've made a highway that goes from 

189
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:02,310
the cluster of hotels,
right?

190
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:05,070
It's like the Giza highway because like 
what do you want to see the pyramid.

191
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,040
And so they take you right there like 
seven minutes.

192
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,430
You're standing in front of these things
and people are trying to sell you stuff.

193
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,900
I would go without hesitation.
You would never

194
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,430
problem.
I need to go.

195
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,260
I have a buddy of mine has been on the 
podcast names John Anthony West and he's

196
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:24,560
created these incredible DVD series 
called magical Egypt.

197
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,080
He's an egyptologist,
uh,

198
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,380
like one of the most knowledgeable,
but there's lots of noise

199
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,610
you can spend your whole life to 
studying.

200
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,230
One Dynasty.
There's so much.

201
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,120
Yeah.
I'm just a casual fan.

202
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,053
I was planning on going with him,
but unfortunately it was just diagnosed 

203
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,330
with stage four cancer.
A lot of you might not know about that.

204
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:44,940
If you do know and you hear you can,
you can google it,

205
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,590
but I put a link up before to try to 
help him and that he's not good.

206
00:08:49,591 --> 00:08:50,424
He's an older gentleman and he's been.
He's been trying to educate people on 

207
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:56,130
Egypt for a long because he's

208
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
a,
he's a scholar when it comes to ancient 

209
00:08:59,131 --> 00:08:59,940
Egypt,
like,

210
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,773
and he's one of those people that's a 
actively trying to kind of rewrite the 

211
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:07,230
history of Egypt as far as like how far 
back it goes.

212
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,730
They've got some pretty rock solid 
evidence to point to the idea that Egypt

213
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:15,000
is a civilization that was probably 
very,

214
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,200
very advanced many,
many,

215
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,034
many thousands of years ago.
And then some sort of a natural 

216
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,740
cataclysmic disaster,
probably asteroidal impacts or something

217
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,840
like that around 10,000
years ago.

218
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,823
Sort of reset society and civilization.
And then they rebuilt from there with 

219
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:30,720
whatever was remained.

220
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,410
That's interesting.
I mean they benefited from having denial

221
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,910
because denial,
you know,

222
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:38,930
the water's rich with nutrients.
So agriculture was huge and people lived

223
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:39,830
good lives.
You know,

224
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,120
the Nile is,
it's massive.

225
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:41,954
It's a,
there's parts of it that are like still 

226
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:45,500
like a lake.
And then when you see it,

227
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,334
like in,
um,

228
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,890
in northern Uganda,
south Sudan,

229
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,830
like right when you cross the border,
you go across this river,

230
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:52,230
like,
you know,

231
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,063
category five Whitewater roaring.
That's the Nile has a lot of different 

232
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,850
phases to it.

233
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,993
Now this,
this wanderlust that you have this like 

234
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,140
crazy touring thing where you just pick 
out a spot and go,

235
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,250
how long have you been doing that?

236
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,590
Uh,
I did conventional,

237
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,433
you know,
I used to do a lot of rock and roll and 

238
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,130
rock and roll.
We'll get you all over Europe,

239
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:12,030
Japan,
Australia,

240
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:14,280
New Zealand,
places like that.

241
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,700
But it won't get you to Egypt,
Morocco,

242
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,550
Tunisia,
Mongolia necessarily.

243
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,530
And so in the nineties,
you know,

244
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:23,364
I'm like,
anyone else in this business you do 

245
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,584
every interview.
And they said you're pretty well 

246
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,710
traveled.
And I'd always have to say,

247
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,544
well caveat,
I've never been to the African 

248
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:32,820
continent.
And then one day I went,

249
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:34,710
well why not?
And so I,

250
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,630
I did some research,
what are you gotTa to do?

251
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,523
You gotta go get a bunch of shots.
Like a lot of them makes you sick for 

252
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:41,454
like a whole day.
They put so many vaccines into you and 

253
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,214
so you go to the travel doctor and you 
show him what countries you're going to 

254
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:46,830
go.

255
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,663
Well,
and they just line up syringes and they 

256
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:52,980
got on either side of me and just like 
just were just Charlie Horsey me in both

257
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,780
arms and they said,
now you're,

258
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,310
now you're ready to go.
So I just said,

259
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,630
well,
I'm going to go to Kenya.

260
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,493
I'm going to go to a Maasai Mara and the
Tanzanian border to see giraffes and 

261
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,530
zebras and lions and all of that and the
Messiah.

262
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,880
It was all.
That was great.

263
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:09,930
I went from there to a Madagascar 
because I just had Madagascar.

264
00:11:09,931 --> 00:11:10,764
You'd better go.
So because I saw it one day I was on a 

265
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,194
flight from Melbourne or Sydney to Perth
going across Australia and I was 

266
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,540
whipping up the map on the airplane 
magazine.

267
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,700
I said,
so there's Madagascar.

268
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:21,534
I did not know I better go and,
and it was one of the better trips I 

269
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:27,000
ever did.
I was at my office one day,

270
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,040
near the end of 1997 I think.

271
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,263
And I know that black Sabbath is getting
back together with the original lineup 

272
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,220
to do two shows at the Birmingham Nec in
England.

273
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,380
So I called Sharon Osborne.
I said,

274
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:38,640
Sharon,
I got this great idea,

275
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,923
I fly out and hang out with black 
sabbath and broke down with a band and 

276
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,094
go to band practice and have a really 
good time and you put me on the guest 

277
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,990
list for this shows and I hang out for 
free.

278
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,900
And it was like the best time I've ever 
had knowing she'd hang up on me.

279
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,173
She said,
let me call them and ask them if that's 

280
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,740
okay because I already knew it,
but I didn't know the rest of the guys.

281
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,570
And she called me later that day.
She said,

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,620
oh,
they think it's fine.

283
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:02,950
Here's the address,
just let us know when to expect you.

284
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,800
So I booked it,
I booked it around my trip to Africa.

285
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,310
So I went a USA London bus up to Wales 
where they were practicing a taxi.

286
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,910
No,
no,

287
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,830
Ozzy.
His assistant came and got me.

288
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,410
So I hung out with Sabbath at band 
practice.

289
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:20,260
Me and the band full band rehearsals the
best,

290
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,510
uh,
watch the shows,

291
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,100
the two reunion shows at the soundboard.
And then the next day I flew to Kenya.

292
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,680
And so it was just a good,
you know,

293
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:30,514
that was a good chunk of travel and I 
ended up in South Africa after all of 

294
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,930
that and said to myself,
okay,

295
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,670
I'm going to come to Africa once a year 
and I just started picking out different

296
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:40,504
chunks of it and it just started going 
and that was 20 years ago and I've been 

297
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:45,101
there,
I don't know,

298
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:48,460
like 20 sometimes.
Wow.

299
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,200
Yeah.
And you never don't learn,

300
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,360
you know,
I call it the big book.

301
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,100
It's where you learn about life and 
death and you can learn that anywhere,

302
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:00,280
but you see big stuff,
you see people who suffer,

303
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,280
people who have no food or water 
security.

304
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,113
Like you and I,
we talk about retirement and life 

305
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,690
insurance and vacation.
A lot of tribes,

306
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:11,080
there's no words or even ideas in their 
lives.

307
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,243
Like I was hanging out with some 
maturity people once in Uganda a few 

308
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,713
years ago and I had a translator is a 
Dinka guy who spoke I guess whatever a 

309
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:20,950
truly people speak.
And I said,

310
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:23,800
can you ask them if they have any words 
in their language for life insurance,

311
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,250
retirement or a vacation?
And they understood retirement.

312
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:28,870
You get too old,
your kids take care of you,

313
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:29,883
but a vacation,
they said you leave somewhere and you 

314
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,700
come back.
Why would you want to leave your home?

315
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,630
It's where all your friends are in your 
family and why would you ever do that?

316
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,823
Or like life insurance,
like what the hell are you talking 

317
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:41,614
about?
And you start meeting people who their 

318
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,340
sense of time and space is,
I've got a bowl,

319
00:13:47,341 --> 00:13:48,220
there's some rice in it.

320
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,400
So like today I got tomorrow,
we'll see where you.

321
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,240
And I think,
okay,

322
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:53,074
in December I'm going to do this.
And we really have a realistic 

323
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:59,350
expectation of being alive and breathing
in December and in your life,

324
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:00,580
you've no doubt thought of,
okay,

325
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,520
when I retire or whatever that means to 
you money,

326
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,354
some kind of security up the road.
There's parts of the world where people 

327
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,594
live their entire life 37 years and then
they don't have a day of that kind of 

328
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,820
security.
They got the t shirt,

329
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:17,821
a stick and some shade and I try and not
as some voitier I'm trying to understand

330
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,314
the world and I can understand it by 
reading some books and seeing some 

331
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:23,314
documentaries,
but there's nothing like getting out 

332
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:26,494
into what Mark Twain called the 
territory of phrase I stole from David 

333
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,423
Lee Roth when he said it to me and David
Lee was actually a real inspiration to 

334
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,834
do a lot of traveling because one time 
we were talking and he just come back 

335
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,060
from open sea kayaking in the Pacific.

336
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,373
So I said,
so why is it Henry is because don't get 

337
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,470
eaten today is a great thing to have on 
your to do list every once in awhile.

338
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,750
I said,
damn,

339
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:50,584
that is profound.
You what he was doing up until recently 

340
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,533
he moved to Japan.
I didn't know anybody there and he was 

341
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:55,784
taking Kendall lessons.
So learning how to sword fight yet 

342
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,260
Japanese master?
Yep.

343
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,200
With this dog.
No,

344
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,280
no.
He told me.

345
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,730
He called me one Sunday a while ago.
I helped him with his autobiography,

346
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:06,890
so I worked with Dave really closely for
many,

347
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,724
many months.
I met him when I was in black flag 30 

348
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,350
some years ago.
I walked by him at an art gallery.

349
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,670
I went,
wait a minute.

350
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,050
Anyway,
black flag,

351
00:15:15,051 --> 00:15:17,380
right?
Like no way.

352
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:19,580
It's the van Halen guy.
We became best buddies,

353
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,830
but he called me from,
from Japan and said,

354
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,720
uh,
he was,

355
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,870
he's learning Japanese.

356
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,703
He's very smart and he is like learning 
Japanese and started speaking Japanese 

357
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,480
and he's just taking lessons,
you know,

358
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:30,314
you said the,
the sword guy was just like every day 

359
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:35,900
just like you're stupid and just like,
just breaking them down.

360
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,330
Yeah.
And he just got an apartment there.

361
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,723
It,
rockstar just gets like this normal 

362
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:44,480
apartment with his dog and just starts 
taking Kendo lessons.

363
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:45,314
Everything.
David's always had a greater 

364
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:48,680
appreciation of,
of,

365
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,753
you know,
that kind of discipline in me comes up 

366
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:52,454
through martial arts since he was a kid 
and I think as someone else in his 

367
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,310
family's into it,
but he's been that way,

368
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,413
you know,
that kind of discipline and you can see 

369
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:02,960
it on stage.
The guy is very physical,

370
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,183
but it's coming from a real disciplined,
not messing around kind of aggression 

371
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:13,601
and control and Dave really loves Japan 
and he says,

372
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,070
he called me,
so I'm living in a small apartment.

373
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm taking my language lessons,
I'm taking my martial arts stuff.

374
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,180
And he was doing sword stuff for quite a
long time though.

375
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,283
Yeah,
he's always been involved in martial 

376
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,890
arts and even the way he sort of 
approached hedonism,

377
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,910
I always felt like it was sort of like 
an applied approach to hedonism,

378
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,910
like his rock star lifestyle thing,
what he was doing.

379
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,930
It's almost like,
look,

380
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,760
not a lot of people get a chance to do 
this.

381
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,673
Yep.
I'm going to do it.

382
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,770
Yeah.
One time he,

383
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,920
when we were working on his book,
he said,

384
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:42,763
you know,
I go home to pass the dean and now and 

385
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:44,894
then where,
you know,

386
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,970
born and raised in some of his high 
school buddies,

387
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,900
seemingly like,
well Dave,

388
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,800
you know,
must be nice,

389
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,530
you know,
being David Lee Roth and he.

390
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,730
And he said,
you know what?

391
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,020
On graduation day from high school,
we all were on the same starting blocks.

392
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,930
You chose the bank job,
that's a sure thing.

393
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,764
You're going to die in that cubicle.
I choose to sail the seas of 

394
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,750
consequences.
I was like,

395
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,060
I love that.
And I was like,

396
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,710
yeah man,
that's daring.

397
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:10,544
And so he won.
I mean like he said it pretty good ride 

398
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:14,870
I reckon.
And,

399
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,510
and so in my own way,
you know,

400
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,110
I,
I come from minimum wage work,

401
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:18,944
I'm nobody from nowhere and I got into 
music via punk rock because the band 

402
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:23,690
black flag said,
hey,

403
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:25,950
you're a crazy guy.
You want to try out to be our singer.

404
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,050
I'm like,
what do I have to lose?

405
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:27,884
Yeah.
And so I went for that and it led to 

406
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:33,200
everything else and ultimately why I'm 
here in this room with you today.

407
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,940
Do you miss rock?
Do you miss touring as a musician?

408
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:38,774
No,
no,

409
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,613
because I did it.

410
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,760
I did it really hard until I had nothing
left to give to it.

411
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,830
And so now if I went back to it,
it would just be repetition and it might

412
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:49,664
be repetition,
but it wouldn't be meaningful in that I 

413
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:55,350
wouldn't be putting out anything new.
And for me,

414
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:56,184
the day I stopped doing music was I woke
up one day and I just sat up and was 

415
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,500
like,
a light bulb went on.

416
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:01,981
I went,
wow,

417
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,590
I'm out of lyrics.
And it wasn't like,

418
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,191
oh no.
I'm like,

419
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:07,140
okay,
well give me my scroll.

420
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,030
I guess I've graduated.
When was this?

421
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,160
Two thousand three years.
And I just called the manager.

422
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,293
I said,
Hey,

423
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,030
I'm done with music.
And he saw a 15 percent of that though,

424
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,160
poof.
And he's like,

425
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:21,390
no.
I went,

426
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:21,931
yeah.
He goes,

427
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:22,860
why?
I said,

428
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:24,900
because I got nothing new to add these 
as well.

429
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,280
Then just go out and do the hits.
I'm like,

430
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:27,114
man,
that's not what coltrane would have 

431
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:29,760
done.
It's not with miles Davis would've done.

432
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,470
I just can't.
I don't want to repeat.

433
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:32,304
It's not artistically brave to me.
And so I'd much rather just try new 

434
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:38,094
things.
But thankfully by that time I was 

435
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:44,340
already doing talking tours all over the
world and they do very well,

436
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,560
uh,
tons of acting voiceover.

437
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,190
I had all this other stuff I was doing,
had the book company,

438
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,380
a record company,
music publishing.

439
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,214
I was,
had all this other stuff and so I just 

440
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,770
kind of let all of that stuff fill in,
put it this way.

441
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,950
I'm busier now than ever and I don't 
miss the music.

442
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,430
I see bands in the airport all the time,
but like the laminates in road gear,

443
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm like,
yeah,

444
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,310
rumble young man rumble.
I had my fill.

445
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,683
Well,
it's beautiful that you did it on your 

446
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,210
terms.
You decided to do it.

447
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,113
It wasn't just,
it wasn't like there's a lot of aging 

448
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,004
rock stars that have that sort of 
existence where they have to go out and 

449
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:20,460
do the head.
Yeah.

450
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,720
No one wants to hear.
He knew shit.

451
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,890
That's a big part of the problem.
And so they have to do that weird circle

452
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:26,724
the wagons thing,
like we're going to play this album in 

453
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,470
its entirety.
Okay.

454
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,010
I go to some of those shows.
I,

455
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,710
I throw my money down and go see that 
band,

456
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,050
do that album in its entirety.
It's cool,

457
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,000
but it's not for me.
Well,

458
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:41,340
I've heard the stones still put on an 
awesome show.

459
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,120
I think one of the cool things about it 
is that like,

460
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,240
wow,
mick jagger can still fucking do it.

461
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,540
He still apparently works out twice a 
day.

462
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,830
Yeah,
he's amazing shame,

463
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:51,170
great shape.
Um,

464
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,170
there's some people and,
and they're,

465
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,200
they're rare.
They actually,

466
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,633
it's not about money.
That's when I really start trusting 

467
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,750
those old rock stars.
Like Rod Stewart doesn't need a dime.

468
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,823
I mean,
that guy can buy four countries right 

469
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,654
now.
He's probably playing tonight and Las 

470
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,630
Vegas or somewhere.
Elton John.

471
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,290
They just really liked doing the thing.
Mick Jagger and Keith Richards,

472
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,900
there'll be rock.
It'll die on stage and it's not money.

473
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,951
It's not like,
Hey,

474
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,120
we might get popular.
It's like,

475
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,010
man,
we really want to play brown sugar.

476
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,130
I don't,
but I admire them.

477
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,650
I think it's what I'm saying is I think 
it's real.

478
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,420
Well,
I'm sure it is real.

479
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,770
Yeah.
I'm sure it's real with a lot of them,

480
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,933
but what I liked with you,
with what you're saying is that you had 

481
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:30,114
already figured out all these other 
paths in life that you were enjoying 

482
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:33,720
putting your creative energy and you 
just decided,

483
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,230
and I just.

484
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,320
I know it was summer 19,
84.

485
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,200
I was 23.
I was in black flag and we were touring.

486
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:41,034
We were staying out of California 
because the Olympics were coming and we 

487
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:47,890
knew the cops would just be looking to 
smash down any supposed do wells.

488
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,910
So we just stayed on tour of the whole 
year pretty much and I noticed all these

489
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,744
great bands around the very talented 
people and everyone we're all broke 

490
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:57,640
between tours were like living like 
sharks.

491
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,990
If we don't like tor,
we don't eat.

492
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:04,210
And between tours the guys in that band,
they're all waiters and not putting that

493
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:07,480
down and say,
but the music wasn't keeping you in rent

494
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,840
12 months a year and I'm not nearly as 
talented as any of them.

495
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:11,471
So I said,
man,

496
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,800
if there those guys are struggling,
then what am I going to do?

497
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,150
I better get plans B,
c,

498
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:16,541
d,
e,

499
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,374
F and g together,
and in those days I just started my 

500
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:21,730
little book publishing company,
so I'm going to work harder on writing.

501
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,130
I'm going to become much better.
Start doing the talking shows.

502
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:24,964
I'm going to get much better at that and
I'm going to start saying yes to things 

503
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,280
when they come along.
A couple of years later,

504
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,960
Hollywood started calling,
Hey,

505
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,210
can you act them because well as I can 
sing click,

506
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,970
but I started,
you know,

507
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,900
acting is crispin glover,
the actor.

508
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,340
One day he said to me,
he said,

509
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:44,341
Henry as a just please consider acting.
Just like just if you get an audition,

510
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,100
don't necessarily say no just because 
you're the music guy.

511
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,800
Like he said,
I think you might really like it and you

512
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:53,230
could probably do it.
And so I said,

513
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:54,064
okay,
and within a year I was doing film and 

514
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,161
then,
Hey,

515
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:58,570
can you do a voiceover?
I'm like,

516
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,530
yeah,
I got a voice.

517
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,100
And so I just started saying yes to more
stuff and that was the plan.

518
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,683
Just have more things to do,
which is fine because I don't like 

519
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,880
sitting around anyway and then 
ironically music ended up being very,

520
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:13,810
very good and all of that for me.
But I had plans,

521
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,460
other plans and I've noticed that a lot 
of old geezers around my era,

522
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,310
they didn't come up with something else 
and they just,

523
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:25,450
I don't know why and they didn't make 
another plan and they get put into those

524
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:27,580
weird tours where there,
you know,

525
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,773
you bring your kid all of that and it's,
it's more that they got to more than 

526
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:34,114
they want to and I'd rather wake up 
wanting to do stuff not having to do 

527
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:38,914
stuff.
I think like you were saying a while 

528
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:41,764
ago,
like less obligation just so you clear 

529
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,900
the deck so you can really do what you 
want because life is short.

530
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,200
I mean last week I was 20 and now I'm 
56.

531
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,590
I mean it goes by really fast.
It doesn't matter if you're in a cubicle

532
00:22:53,591 --> 00:22:55,420
or a prison cell and then you wake up 
one day,

533
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,290
you're like,
damn,

534
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,800
that was fast and so you might as well 
make it as much as what you wanted to be

535
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,510
as possible because all you're getting 
is older.

536
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,120
I don't understand why people don't fear
that I wake up everyday.

537
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,000
But with the,
uh,

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,860
the grim reaper side whistling by my ear
going,

539
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:14,500
you better get up man.
And it's all the up I need.

540
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,950
I don't ever sleep in.
I mean,

541
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,380
how many hours a night between a four 
and five or six that's going to age.

542
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,880
I don't like it.
Don't like sleeping.

543
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,680
Are you sleeping?
I just,

544
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,180
you know,
I,

545
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,030
I get up,
I'm like,

546
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,910
damn man,
I got to do stuff.

547
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,710
But does not diminish your energy when 
you.

548
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,341
Sometimes,
yeah,

549
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,380
I have those Uzi afternoons where I,
I,

550
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,390
I take the seven minute power naps in 
my,

551
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,040
in my chair at the office.

552
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:40,230
But um,
I,

553
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,550
I just try and,
you know what I have found,

554
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,980
if you want to not have to sleep eight 
hours a day,

555
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,190
you maintain a really good diet.
You can shave about an hour of sleep off

556
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,024
you,
keep your proteins and your 

557
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:54,320
carbohydrates lean and stay away from 
food that's really fun to eat burgers,

558
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,790
French fries and all that,
which is,

559
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:56,624
I'd live on that if I could.
But if you keep your diet really 

560
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,423
together and you keep your workouts up,
I have found that you want to like not 

561
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:06,224
get tired during the day,
workout at five in the morning and the 

562
00:24:08,451 --> 00:24:11,480
rest of the day you're just kind of 
buzzing where you think you'd face plant

563
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,020
onto your desk.
Sometimes when I'm really humming,

564
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,290
I'm up at 4:30
and I'm in the gym by 4:55

565
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,430
PM and I'm just,
you know,

566
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,810
on the 5:00
AM you mean?

567
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,670
Yeah,
for 55,

568
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:26,001
eight.
Oh,

569
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:26,960
5:00
PM.

570
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,490
Oh,
sorry.

571
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:27,900
No,
uh,

572
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,490
yeah,
uh,

573
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,200
early in the morning figuring,
you know,

574
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:32,150
oh by noon I'll just be like dead 
asleep.

575
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,870
Aww Man.
I'm wired and a to go to sleep at night.

576
00:24:35,871 --> 00:24:37,310
Like last night I was uh,
it was,

577
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,830
I was kind of wired,
so I just started doing.

578
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:40,920
I'm like,
yeah,

579
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:44,330
people have drinking games.
I was playing a 45,

580
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:46,250
so my record player,
so when I would,

581
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,213
when I'd have to flip the 45,
I would do a set of pushups and so I 

582
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:51,554
played a bunch of 45 last night,
so I did a bunch of pushups and by the 

583
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:54,824
time I'm done with a 45,
I felt like I'd been caned by a pro in 

584
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:59,570
Singapore.
I was so tired,

585
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,900
man.
So I slept dreamless sleep last night.

586
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,990
Looks like a dead man.
You wrote a piece a long time ago that I

587
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:06,824
really enjoyed about power lifting and 
it was something on the lines of the 

588
00:25:10,221 --> 00:25:11,240
iron never lies.

589
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,530
It doesn't lie.
Yeah.

590
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,750
I love that.
Oh,

591
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,610
it was great because it was put that in 
gyms all over.

592
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,503
It was.
So you nailed it because it was so 

593
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,670
honest and it was.
It's so highlighted.

594
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:27,671
What is so beneficial about forcing 
yourself to do hard work?

595
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,590
Yeah.
And the fact that you are going,

596
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:31,820
okay,
I don't,

597
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,630
I'd rather not,
but here we go and it's a.

598
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:37,700
I like to build that muscle,
not,

599
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:41,150
but here I go muscle.
And that's more important than any brand

600
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:42,560
you're going to have.
You know,

601
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,610
it's,
it's for me,

602
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:47,330
the workout is all I go to the gym to 
get my head right.

603
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,000
The benefit is I,
you know,

604
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,810
you,
you get in good shape.

605
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,330
But like I just finished a bunch of 
shows.

606
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,270
I did 27 shows in America.
I just finished a bunch of shows.

607
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:00,320
I did 27 on one day off 27 on two and a 
half hours on stage and night,

608
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,360
no notes,
talking at a high rate of speed.

609
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,670
The only way I got through that was 
really good diet and three days on,

610
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:08,504
one day off workouts it was,
it was the workouts that alleviated the 

611
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:15,560
stress that made the sleep,
restorative the muscle tissue,

612
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,240
uh,
absorb it into nutrients,

613
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:19,490
et Cetera,
and made the show's good.

614
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,700
And so for me,
the workout since I was about 15,

615
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,140
that's been as much a part of my day as 
anything just to.

616
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,300
Otherwise they get kinda mentally 
clogged.

617
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:31,620
They get depressed now.
You still doing all those,

618
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,970
you still doing power lifting?
No,

619
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,461
no,
no,

620
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,080
no.
My body left the building on that.

621
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:40,220
Years ago when you,
when Beavis and butthead made fun of one

622
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:41,750
of your songs.
Do you remember that?

623
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,830
Oh yeah.
Fucking great.

624
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:45,030
It made a seller.
It sold.

625
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,640
It wasn't the worst thing that ever 
happened.

626
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:49,950
God Damn Dude,
your neck was as big as my waist.

627
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:50,580
You were huge.

628
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,620
It was actually a fatter than my ears 
really has to.

629
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,870
There's just those,
those muscle groups that just jump up.

630
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,733
You know,
if you do a lot of shrugs all sudden 

631
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,190
death traps are like equal to the top of
your head.

632
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:04,530
Their muscles is this blow up.
And those.

633
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,870
What are those?
Like the sternomastoid muscle,

634
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,550
whatever that big one is on the side of 
your neck.

635
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,180
I just,
everything I did seem to hit that muscle

636
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:13,014
group the way I like pull up a dead lift
or the way you hold a bar during squats 

637
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,123
that neck muscles,
always doing something to support a lot 

638
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,260
of weight.
And so it just got worked and worked and

639
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,400
that's when the Beavis and butthead 
like,

640
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,270
oh,
he's got a big neck.

641
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:26,300
I liked that.
Um,

642
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,390
but when did you stop doing the.
There?

643
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,370
There is or there?
Yeah.

644
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,110
Oh yeah,
that's 94.

645
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,080
We shot that in the desert and we shot 
that in the Mojave desert.

646
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,963
Um,
when did you stop doing the power of 

647
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,440
that in the,
in the,

648
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:41,274
uh,
early two thousands just because I felt 

649
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,830
a problems in my back and,
and you know,

650
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,960
for squat day I'm like,
you know,

651
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,170
belt belting up,
I'm wrapping my knees.

652
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,540
I was like really going for it and like 
my frame,

653
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,050
it just can't support my attitude.
And so my attitude is like I'll lift the

654
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,780
whole damn gym and my,
I was reminded,

655
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,720
my body went and then not really,
you're more of a swimmer,

656
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,280
runner type,
you're not trying to.

657
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,260
And so I was lifting a lot for a guy my 
size and my,

658
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,743
my bone mass and so at one point my back
and shoulder started hurting and like a 

659
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:17,780
different kind of pain,
like,

660
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,643
you know,
that you shouldn't be doing this 

661
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:19,860
anymore.

662
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,800
And so the workouts I do now,
if I can't lift a 10 times,

663
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,170
I just don't,
I just pull the way down so I can.

664
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,930
So a lot of it's um,
you know,

665
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,200
treadmill,
elliptical,

666
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,590
and a stationary bike and a lot of 
pullups pushups and uh,

667
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,531
like,
you know,

668
00:28:34,531 --> 00:28:37,260
a lot of compound lifts,
bench press,

669
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:39,750
stuff like that.
But mainly a lot of pull ups,

670
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,650
a trx straps that the guy who invented 
them gave them to me as a gift.

671
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,903
And that's great.
And they're great because it's just you 

672
00:28:46,651 --> 00:28:49,350
and your body.
And not that natural resistance.

673
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,790
I have found that it makes me a bit more
limber and I dunno,

674
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,980
I don't need to lift everything in the 
gym.

675
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm 56.
I,

676
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,370
you know,
I don't it,

677
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,633
all I can do is like blow out that one 
day and never be able to raise my arm 

678
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,760
over my head again,
you know,

679
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,730
blew his shoulder out so I don't need 
it.

680
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,830
Do you fuck around with Yoga at all?
Uh,

681
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,680
but I admire it because you see people 
who do yoga and there's,

682
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:14,220
so not only are they flexible,
but you can tell they're really grounded

683
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,660
in themselves.
Like they're really,

684
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,733
they're,
they're coming on with an energy that I 

685
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:20,820
don't have.
Well,

686
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:22,500
it does something to you,
uh,

687
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:26,520
the alleviation of tension to increasing
range of motion and flexibility.

688
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:28,470
It also does something to your mind.
Yeah,

689
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,020
that's what I noticed in their group.
They're grueling classes,

690
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,910
like an hour and a half in a hot yoga 
room.

691
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,253
It also does something to your body 
that's probably related to sauna 

692
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:38,730
treatments,
like they've shown it.

693
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,040
Sauna treatments and heat shock proteins
do amazing

694
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,290
things to your body to reduce 
inflammation and,

695
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,533
and,
and just the grueling physical and 

696
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:54,100
mental grind of getting through a class.
I've heard the hot yoga is brutal.

697
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,720
It's brutal.
People.

698
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,960
I've met so many people as you do and 
girls.

699
00:29:58,961 --> 00:29:59,471
I said,
you know,

700
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:02,290
you think you work out hard,
you should come to a yoga class.

701
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,210
You will cry.
You won't even make it like they try and

702
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,044
challenge me.
I'm like,

703
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,930
I actually got scared of all that.
They said,

704
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,764
you want to work out.
You won't be able to pick up your car 

705
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:12,820
keys at the end of it.
Well,

706
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,540
I'm sure you can pick up your car keys,
but it is really brutal.

707
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:18,940
While you're doing afterwards,
you don't feel the same way.

708
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,740
You feel like if you lift weights too 
hard,

709
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,400
you know that feeling like,
oh well you can't move your body.

710
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,750
You don't really get that,
but you do get just fucking to the point

711
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,000
where you're looking at the clock and 
you realize there's 20 minutes to go.

712
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,833
You're like,
I don't know if I could get 20 hours a 

713
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
year.
Head is hot.

714
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:36,820
You're your body's pouring water.
Wow.

715
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,340
Now you can lose five,
six pounds in a class easily.

716
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,590
Yeah.
I've heard that about those spin classes

717
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:45,220
to people lose too much weight.
They have to stop and like the less days

718
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:45,791
a week.
Yeah,

719
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:46,624
it makes sense because you're also on 
the momentum of the energy of the room 

720
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,350
and the.
If the instructor is really good,

721
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:52,690
you get hyped up and then start pushing 
a little too hard.

722
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,070
I've never been in a class like that.
I'm not the biggest people person.

723
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,140
That's why I started working out when I 
was in high school.

724
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,063
I couldn't throw the ball straight so 
the gym was always empty so I just went 

725
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,820
in there,
but I've never,

726
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,990
you know,
been like,

727
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:06,310
hey class,
I've never done that.

728
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,810
Well,
the good thing about yoga classes,

729
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,360
no one talks so you know,
you're around those people.

730
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,194
There's no interaction.
It's just you kind of feel each other 

731
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:14,554
and it's kind of cool because he pushed 
each other a little bit without 

732
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:16,654
communicating,
but I'm a big fan of it man and I think 

733
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:22,090
as far as like increasing your longevity
of your body,

734
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:24,750
the use of your body,
it seems to me that it does,

735
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,584
is kind of forge all the connections 
between your joints in your body and 

736
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:31,150
your core and it just makes everything 
better,

737
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,320
right?
Like I don't have as much,

738
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,183
nearly as much back pain as I used to,
a more flexible than I have been in 

739
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:38,500
years.
I've been like a year and a half,

740
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,780
maybe almost two years I've been really 
into it.

741
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,230
And how many days a week you go?
I tried to do three.

742
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,580
I usually wind up a lot.

743
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,160
One,
I usually wind up one or two,

744
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,650
but I try for three when I can get three
and I do it.

745
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,010
But um,
between that and all the other different

746
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,120
kinds of workouts,
slinky,

747
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,193
really what I like to do is I like to 
wake up and decide what I'm going to do 

748
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,160
when I wake up.
Some days I'm like,

749
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,900
I want to go kick box,
I want to go to Jujitsu,

750
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:03,430
I want to lift weights,
I want to go to yoga.

751
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,480
That's cool.
Yeah.

752
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,090
I just like we were talking about before
the podcast started,

753
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,590
what I'm trying to do with my life at 
this point I'm almost 50 and 49.

754
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:12,424
I'll be 50 in August is to have as few 
obligations as possible and as much 

755
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:17,674
passion and interest as possible and 
just sort of pursue the things that I'm 

756
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:22,360
really enjoying.
That keeps you ageless.

757
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,423
I,
I just have met so many people by 23 

758
00:32:26,081 --> 00:32:26,914
they're kind of retired or then you meet
some 75 year old guy who just run rings 

759
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:32,044
around you and it's all in your head and
the choices you make and I've seen both 

760
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,530
ends of that spectrum or the old guy is 
like younger than you'll ever be and the

761
00:32:39,531 --> 00:32:40,070
young guy

762
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,903
is just like so pouring into.
So he turned into his dad or something 

763
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:44,841
like,
damn man,

764
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,800
who,
who got to you.

765
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,080
What I take fuel from is like things 
like your podcast with Ari,

766
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,510
because I was listening to you talk all 
about the adventures that you've had and

767
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:59,330
the travel and the way you go about it,
and I got fired up,

768
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:00,800
man.
I was listening to that.

769
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,000
I was like,
I love this.

770
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:04,370
I love that.
No one's telling you to do this.

771
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:06,730
This isn't a fucking cubicle job.
Oh No.

772
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,210
Just starting.
Yeah.

773
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,890
Yeah.
He was deciding to do this.

774
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,753
Realizing the most gratifying thing in 
my life consistently as coming up with 

775
00:33:15,441 --> 00:33:16,870
an idea,
you know,

776
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,030
where it goes from the cerebral to the 
physical,

777
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,070
like I'm going to write this book.
Okay.

778
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:24,770
Three years from now I'm still going to 
be working on this thing,

779
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,570
so long journey,
so here we go,

780
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,763
or I'm going to get to this country or 
I'm going to get back to this country 

781
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:31,544
and come in through that way and you 
just make these plans and then months 

782
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:35,120
later,
boom.

783
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,953
There you are.
Like I was in Thailand making a 

784
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:37,874
documentary years ago and I was reading 
in the Herald Tribune at breakfast one 

785
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:41,954
morning.
I was in Chiang Mai that the following 

786
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,760
year is going to be the 25th anniversary
of the Bhopal disaster in Bhopal,

787
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:48,950
India when you need carbide,
India Limited,

788
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:49,784
uh,
the methyl methyl isocyanate tank 

789
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,600
exploded.
Killed a bunch of people.

790
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,823
I said,
I'm going,

791
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,050
I'm going to be there for the 25th 
anniversary.

792
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:57,884
So I took out an entire year and 
researched and I was there for the 25th 

793
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:02,390
anniversary.
I was in the march.

794
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,130
I snuck onto the,
uh,

795
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,121
the,
the uh,

796
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:10,121
Union Carbide India Limited site.
I found the exact panel where tank 6:10

797
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,870
blew up.
I found the switch.

798
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,913
I went all the way to where I was 
standing in front of it with the tag on 

799
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,800
the thing says mic methyl isocyanate.
I think that's it.

800
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,880
Uh,
that was the gas.

801
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:21,560
They hit the water and went and blew up.

802
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,590
They're making bug spray there.
And so I went all the way to like,

803
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,690
here is where the guy was flicking the 
switch going.

804
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,710
Oh No.
Oh No.

805
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:30,590
The guest scrubbers,
the neutralizers aren't working.

806
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,790
Uh,
and I was sneaking around.

807
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,460
There's like armed guards,
they're not going to shoot you,

808
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:35,294
but they'll tell you,
they'll kick you off and so I just make 

809
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:40,190
these decisions and then ultimately 
you're booking the tickets,

810
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:44,390
you're booking the hotel and then one 
day you are crawling through the weeds,

811
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,290
avoiding security guys on there,
motor scooters with your camera,

812
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,050
sneaking in at a buildings,
getting your shots.

813
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,943
I mean,
I love to take these things from like 

814
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:56,120
sitting in a coffee place going,
oh,

815
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,830
to like,
wow,

816
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,693
here I am in Laos in Zen Queen at the 
plane of jars is a place I've always 

817
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,014
wanted to go to.
I saw it in a documentary and then two 

818
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:08,780
years later I'm at the plane of jars and
you're writing about all this stuff.

819
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,720
So this is a thing.
You're taking the photographs and you're

820
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,580
writing blog entries A.
Yeah,

821
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,433
I write for the La Weekly.
Once a week I write for rolling Stone 

822
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,793
Australia once a month and then I've 
read about 27 books and they're in 

823
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:23,040
translation.
Yeah.

824
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,171
Um,
so.

825
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,004
And I,
well I own the company so I sleep with 

826
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:29,570
the owner every night.
And so a lot of my books or travel,

827
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,790
I do like two years of journal at a 
time.

828
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,860
And the middle sections,
photographs,

829
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,020
uh,
I'm working on my second photo book.

830
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:36,854
My first one came out and uh,
the second one is going to be pretty 

831
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,490
cool because all my North Korea shots,
that'll be crazy.

832
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,533
Oh Wow.
You went to North Korea to where we're 

833
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:48,210
used to get that visa few years ago.
So sad he was doing Kim Jong.

834
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,610
Il was still alive.
It was Kim Jong,

835
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:51,090
Il.
Yeah.

836
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,590
The lit last days of Kim Jong Il before 
Kim Jong wound.

837
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,760
Yeah.
And it was just a,

838
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:59,370
you know,
like when I was in Iran,

839
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,130
just like they point you in what you're 
supposed to look at.

840
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,780
Don't look over here.
It's a propaganda.

841
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,370
How much time did you spend in North 
Korea?

842
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:06,343
About a week.
I was in Pyongyang and the areas around 

843
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,313
Pyongyang and then I went there via 
Beijing and then from there up to 

844
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:16,200
Mongolia.
Then over to Butan was North Korea.

845
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,550
Like just sad,
you know,

846
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:21,270
this poor people who are scared of their
government.

847
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,530
And uh,
my tour guides since I went there alone,

848
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,400
they were very suspicious of me.
So they put two tour spies on me,

849
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,020
the Nice one who talked to me and the 
mean one who does scaled and took notes.

850
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,390
And every day that guy would ask me 
basically the same question.

851
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:41,820
It's like when a detective is trying to 
peel the layers of onion skin off.

852
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,030
So you said you're a businessman.
I'm like,

853
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:46,460
yeah,
like,

854
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,440
so what do you do?
Like,

855
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,480
you know,
I edit books,

856
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,170
which is true mine.
And it's really,

857
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,220
what are the books about?
I said,

858
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:53,980
well,
you know,

859
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,650
uh,
often they're not that good.

860
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,523
And so you're all putting one hotel,
a you and the Dutch tourists and the 

861
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,173
Australians.
Everyone's in the one hotel across the 

862
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:06,180
bridge that's with men,
with rifles.

863
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:07,014
You're not going anywhere.
And so every day they go on their buses 

864
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:12,810
and I get in the car and the Australians
recognize me,

865
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,910
the Brits recognize me and they all want
photos were walking to the um,

866
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:21,270
uh,
whatever that room is the,

867
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,220
um,
the room where the north and south meet,

868
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,443
uh,
where they come in through the northern 

869
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:27,780
Jordan,
the southern doors,

870
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,320
that blue room on the DSJ.
Uh,

871
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,190
I'll,
I'll come up with the joint,

872
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,080
the JSA,
the joint security area,

873
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:34,914
something like that.
I pulled one of the Australians to the 

874
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,014
site.
I said,

875
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,903
can you please call your friends off me 
because my tour spy is starting to ask 

876
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:48,960
me really weird questions about why 
people want their photo with me.

877
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,990
And if I'm caught being in movies,
writing books,

878
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,213
rock'n'roll,
I'm going downtown for a meeting that I 

879
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:55,884
might not get out of.
And so he cooled out all his Australian 

880
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,334
friends.
But then there's this one British guy 

881
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,853
who does kept getting in my face with a 
camera because you're all getting taken 

882
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:06,390
to the same places.
And I'll never forget this.

883
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:07,224
My tour guide,
who for the previous three days was 

884
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,960
like,
his English was from school,

885
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:11,794
like how Henry he went from that to how 
does this guy know you and all of a 

886
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,240
sudden his English was as good as mine.
I'm like,

887
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,760
oh no,
and I'm not good at lying.

888
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,410
So I said I met him in the breakfast 
room.

889
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,820
I don't know,
maybe he's hot for me.

890
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:27,540
I have no explaining it away and I just 
had to kind of go,

891
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:28,374
I don't know,
and I had to try and avoid this guy and 

892
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,230
I was getting overly nervous.

893
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,093
The last day I was there when they 
finally took me back to the airport in 

894
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:36,851
Beijing.
I'm like,

895
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,620
damn man,
am I really getting on this plane?

896
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,710
And when the plane took off man,
I just like,

897
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,890
okay,
I did that,

898
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,830
but why wouldn't you just say I'm a 
musician.

899
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,980
I'm a feeling.
Will let you inform.

900
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,380
I went on a tourist visa and if you 
claim any of that,

901
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:53,200
you're going to get tons of scrutiny and
they're not going to let you in.

902
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,970
They won't let you in if you're an 
artist.

903
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,240
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

904
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,690
Because they fear it,
they fear what?

905
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,524
You'll go back to the mainland with 
something and you're wrong because 

906
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:02,584
you're a public person.
I don't want to lead a basketball 

907
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:06,090
player.
What the fuck?

908
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:06,751
Broaden.
Yeah.

909
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:10,180
How was he towed the party line and just
told Obama,

910
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,100
you know,
just just call your pal Kim.

911
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,330
Sure.
That'll work out great.

912
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,430
And same thing when I was in a,
I was,

913
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,323
I went to Tehran via Dubai and the guy 
who met me at the airport after the 

914
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,640
airport people got done grilling me.
Uh,

915
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,191
he said,
look,

916
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,680
I got your visa.
I know who you are.

917
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm not your tour guide.
He's a government guy.

918
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,040
Don't tell him what you do for a living,
will never get you outta here.

919
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,760
So the last is the last time in that 
country.

920
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,970
I'm eating dinner with this guy and his 
amazing wife,

921
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,000
they're both like rocket scientists and 
they,

922
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:42,834
you know,
they get by with a website that gets 

923
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,180
thesis done.
So his cousin,

924
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,070
her cousin Anousha the woman,
her cousin calls her and says,

925
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,050
your friend Henry's on TV.
And uh,

926
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,020
he dropped his fork and said,
we've got to go.

927
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:01,260
We had to get you to your hotel.

928
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,910
You got to pack up right now.
We just go to the airport,

929
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,380
check in,
check your luggage,

930
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,423
find a corner,
put your face in it and wait for the 

931
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,700
flight.
And I got to the,

932
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,000
I got to the airport like four hours 
early because he said you just,

933
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,863
you got to go low.
And so I just sat there in the airport 

934
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:19,390
with my face down and then eventually 
got on like,

935
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:19,771
you know,
the,

936
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:22,120
the 3:00
AM to Dubai and I was outta there.

937
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,790
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

938
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,113
What would have happened if you got 
caught questions which leads to more 

939
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:30,310
questions and you just don't know.
It turns into like,

940
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:34,510
well he's been interrogated for the last
three months and we don't know.

941
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,403
And since I'm not a hot looking girl,
a president Clinton's not coming to 

942
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:39,540
rescue me.
And,

943
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,443
and so those are the two countries I've 
been to where don't tell them what you 

944
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,570
do with what I was instructed before I 
left.

945
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,040
Wow.
Yeah.

946
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,010
Because anywhere else,
you know,

947
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:51,680
you just go and show up now.
Every dude,

948
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,950
do you go to every,
all these places that you go to,

949
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,810
do you pick places where there's like 
high populations of people?

950
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,010
Do you ever go to like really nomadic 
places?

951
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,080
Um,
I,

952
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,033
I tend to choose places where there's 
just been an election or there's going 

953
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:08,050
to be an election or there just was a 
war where there's conflict,

954
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:11,320
where you see signs of a,
with the wrath of globalization,

955
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,430
the wrath of global climate change,
uh,

956
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,110
places that are politically hot.
All of these are of great interest to me

957
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,450
during the Bush administration.
He said,

958
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:20,680
don't go to this country,
this country,

959
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,311
this country.
I went to,

960
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,144
all of them went to every access country
they had and I went to the ones that ms 

961
00:41:26,441 --> 00:41:28,090
dot Condoleezza Rice to me not to go to.

962
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,360
I went there too.
I told you personally,

963
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:31,831
no,
no,

964
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:32,560
no,
no,

965
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,580
don't go to Bella,
Rosa bellaruse.

966
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,540
And,
uh,

967
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,373
and so I,
I try and I tried to go to all of those 

968
00:41:39,081 --> 00:41:40,190
places and,
and I,

969
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,050
I'm fine,
I came back in one piece,

970
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,390
but in the last few years I started 
doing more eco travel to learn about,

971
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,820
you know,
coded bio diversity,

972
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:52,790
codependent ecosystems.
So two years ago,

973
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,800
some are 16,
15,

974
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,850
I had time off because I wasn't on tour.
And so I went to Easter Island,

975
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,260
uh,
via,

976
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,070
uh,
I was in Ecuador for a while on the Napo

977
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,660
River,
which is a tributary of the Amazon.

978
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,900
And I went on a science boat and I just 
sat with scientists,

979
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,370
botanists,
bird people,

980
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,383
and learned about how the jungle 
interconnects and how this parasite 

981
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,660
kills that tree,
which fertilizes that tree.

982
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,340
And it's really integrated.
It's amazing.

983
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,020
And they're losing their forest because 
of timber and oil,

984
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,170
you know,
the big money and cattle production to a

985
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,840
that I did,
I did not know about.

986
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,673
But when I was in the interior,
and it's all about hardwood and oil and 

987
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:35,991
all those,
uh,

988
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,310
you know,
the Ro one,

989
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:38,144
people,
the interior tribes are just getting 

990
00:42:39,771 --> 00:42:41,150
discovered and,
and you know,

991
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:41,984
their,
their land is getting cleared out and 

992
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,300
the government's making a ton of money 
off it cannibalizing their own land.

993
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,390
And uh,
in November of 2015 I was a,

994
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,400
I went to Antarctica and that's the most
substantive trip I've ever made.

995
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,530
That was the most mind blowing trip I've
ever done where,

996
00:43:00,531 --> 00:43:01,364
you know,
you see either you go on deception 

997
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,514
island and you look down and there's 
bits of broken glass from the whale 

998
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:08,024
killers.
They use that island to process and 

999
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:13,400
render Wales.
So it's like chips of bone of whale bone

1000
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,910
and all the crap these people left tin 
shacks.

1001
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,813
Uh,
there's like a transmission in the sand 

1002
00:43:19,251 --> 00:43:20,084
from some vehicle and you see what 
unregulated slaughter looks like with 

1003
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:23,661
his,
like,

1004
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:24,830
hey,
let's make a bunch of money.

1005
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,663
Screw the animals will grow back.
And they nearly hunted down the seals 

1006
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,040
and whales,
those particular species to extinction.

1007
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,400
And so I did,
uh,

1008
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:36,170
I got on a ship full of scientists and 
you take lectures every day and you walk

1009
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:37,004
around amongst the Gentoo and the Chin 
strap and the Adelie penguins and you 

1010
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:45,850
learn a lot and it's hard to take 
because it's almost destructing in front

1011
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:50,120
of you and it's sad and it's beautiful.
It's like being on the moon.

1012
00:43:50,121 --> 00:43:50,954
I mean,
you didn't want to sleep just for 

1013
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:54,230
looking out the window or walking around
with some penguin.

1014
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,580
Walking by you is surreal.
And I'm hopefully November of this year,

1015
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:00,380
I'll have some time.
So I want to.

1016
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,050
I made friends with the scientists on 
the ship and they said,

1017
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:04,970
look,
obviously you're really into this.

1018
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,520
You should come back because we have a 
longer trip.

1019
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:08,354
We do.
That starts in the south Georgia and 

1020
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:09,620
islands.

1021
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,131
I went,
oh,

1022
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:12,170
I'm there.
So I'm going to see if I,

1023
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,990
if I'm not working in November,
I don't have my schedule yet.

1024
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,900
If I'm free,
I'm going and you go,

1025
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:18,734
uh,
you go down through Argentina and you 

1026
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,250
leave from there.
Oh Wow.

1027
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:24,680
So it starts in Antarctica.
You work through Argentina.

1028
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:27,530
How long will you go down the first 
time?

1029
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:30,000
The one time I went,
I went to our point of,

1030
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,100
sorry,
it's down to [inaudible],

1031
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,183
which is the southern most city in the 
world and that's where you pick up the 

1032
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:34,914
ship and you go through the drake 
passage and by day four finally you 

1033
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:41,400
start seeing ice and then you look off 
and like,

1034
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,410
Whoa,
those are penguins and there you are.

1035
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:47,310
But it takes days to get there and the 
days to get back.

1036
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:50,370
So there's like three days on either end
where there's kind of nothing to do,

1037
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:54,570
but take lectures in the lounge about 
history and all of that,

1038
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:57,060
which I did with my notepad out and 
questioned,

1039
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:57,894
uh,
the lecturers afterwards and got a ton 

1040
00:44:59,011 --> 00:44:59,670
of information.

1041
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,450
I keep in touch with him actually.
What a fucking bizarre and exciting life

1042
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,330
you live now.
I love it.

1043
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,970
Uh,
you know,

1044
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,520
knowing I was going to be meeting you 
and I must say,

1045
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,391
uh,
you know,

1046
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:10,224
this,
you have a lot of fans and I wish I had 

1047
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:12,414
a dollar for the last few years.
So many people have been writing me 

1048
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,540
saying like,
you should be on Joe Rogan's podcast and

1049
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:20,040
like,
or have you done it yet?

1050
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,030
And I missed it.
I'm like,

1051
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,120
finally,
this was like.

1052
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,940
And I knew who you were.
So it wasn't like,

1053
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:25,260
who's this Joe Rogan Guy?
And I'm like,

1054
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,660
enough already.
But man,

1055
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,550
people like you and I used to.
You remember that show UFC primetime?

1056
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,241
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1057
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:34,760
I was the voice.
I was,

1058
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:38,190
I did that voice.
So I don't know a lot about sports,

1059
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,760
but I learned a lot about mma just 
because I'm these people.

1060
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:44,903
These fighters become relevant to me 
because I'm saying their names over and 

1061
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:48,970
over and I'm watching the footage and 
you know,

1062
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,823
I met Bj Penn.
I interviewed him once for the 

1063
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:54,990
independent film channel or no,
for a participant media.

1064
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:56,730
I think it was.
Anyway,

1065
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:01,620
I started being more aware of,
of these fighters and all of this stuff.

1066
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:04,450
And then that's when I,
I saw you and I,

1067
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,450
I was thinking about you the other day 
knowing I was going to meet you thinking

1068
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:09,220
like here's this guy with this,
you know,

1069
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,750
very interesting life because I've seen 
the standup on,

1070
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,613
on,
on tv and there he is in the middle of 

1071
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,650
the octagon with some guy who just got 
finished knocking the other guy.

1072
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:23,790
Like that's a very eclectic life.
You've got.

1073
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,661
I mean you,
you,

1074
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:25,494
you are doing,
I'm sure you didn't grow up anything 

1075
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:32,100
like the rest of your family and all the
kids you went to high school with you,

1076
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:34,470
you went to a different way,
right?

1077
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,410
Yeah.
obviously.

1078
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:40,050
So when did you decide it's not,
you're not going to be a realtor on your

1079
00:46:40,051 --> 00:46:41,790
face isn't going to be on the bus bench?

1080
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,213
Well,
I had zero work ethic towards anything 

1081
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:46,664
that I didn't enjoy,
but anything that I did enjoy with I'd 

1082
00:46:49,341 --> 00:46:50,174
become obsessed with just it would 
occupy all my thoughts and I couldn't 

1083
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:57,920
wait to do it 24 hours a day.
And then when I got out of high school,

1084
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,263
I took a year off before I went to 
college and the only reason why I went 

1085
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:04,610
to college was because I didn't want 
people to think when I was a loser,

1086
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:07,010
I was tired of people telling people 
that I wasn't doing anything.

1087
00:47:07,011 --> 00:47:09,200
So I went to college.
I went to boston,

1088
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,620
umass boston for.
The only reason why I went was because I

1089
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,970
didn't want people thinking I was a 
loser.

1090
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,750
And I knew that I could not exist in a 
regular job.

1091
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,700
I just,
I didn't have it whenever it was.

1092
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,930
Yeah,
it's a thing,

1093
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:22,910
you know,
when you know you don't have it,

1094
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,470
it's kind of scary.
Like,

1095
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:26,360
oh no,
I'm not going to have a straight life.

1096
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,010
Oh no,
what am I going to do?

1097
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,390
It was like,
it was radioactive.

1098
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,070
Like I would take

1099
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,230
construction jobs.
And it was like I was being poisoned,

1100
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,130
you know?
It was like,

1101
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,460
it was literally like I was getting 
ready.

1102
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,300
I feel like you're dying.
You're,

1103
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,830
you're young and you're awake and you're
like,

1104
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,510
I'm dying.
This is killing me.

1105
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:42,590
I thought I was gonna.
Have a life of those jobs.

1106
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,424
So I went out of high school.
I went one semester at american 

1107
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:48,190
university in Washington dc trying to 
see if I liked college.

1108
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,990
I liked learning.
I just didn't like,

1109
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:50,853
you know,
I hated school so another four years on 

1110
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:55,270
a student loan,
like one semester.

1111
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,550
It took me so many years to earn my way 
out of that debt.

1112
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,780
And so I just kinda went into the 
working world going at this is,

1113
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,210
this is going to be rough.
I mean this is gonna hurt.

1114
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:05,223
It's gonna be swollen feet and a lot of 
top ramen noodles and no sleep and my 

1115
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:10,270
crap apartment,
but this is my life.

1116
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,403
And I felt like someone was strangling 
me because I just knew I didn't know 

1117
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:17,080
where I was going to go or what I should
be doing,

1118
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,590
but I knew that this wasn't it.
ThIs was going to kill me.

1119
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,530
My thing.
There's a lot of

1120
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:26,660
well out there like that and for some 
awful reason they never find whatever it

1121
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:27,954
is that can break them free.
They never catch a ride on that river 

1122
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,570
out,
you know?

1123
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:36,000
and I got lucky,
I found standup comedy and uh,

1124
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:36,893
I had heard already,
I think I love how a lot of it had come 

1125
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:42,810
from martial arts too.
I'd fought A lot and I competed a lot in

1126
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:43,644
martial arts tournaments.
And I think that from that I realized 

1127
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:46,914
that like these unconventional paths,
they brought me something that I wasn't 

1128
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,670
getting from regular life.
I get brought me self esteem.

1129
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,140
It gave me this feeling that it wasn't 
a,

1130
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,080
it was the only thing that I'd ever done
my whole life where I've said,

1131
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,490
wow,
maybe I'm not a loser,

1132
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,100
but I kind of thought I was an outcast 
and a loser.

1133
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,143
And then all of a sudden I was 
successful at something only because I 

1134
00:49:04,561 --> 00:49:05,394
was obsessed with it.
But then I knew there was no way I was 

1135
00:49:08,761 --> 00:49:10,440
ever going to be able to hold a regular 
job.

1136
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,990
And then I got lucky when I was 21 and I
found standup.

1137
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:14,303
And so from then on,
I'd kind of like locked into this thing 

1138
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:17,574
where I'm just going to do what I like 
and fuck what everybody says because 

1139
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,450
everybody's given me advice to do this 
and advice,

1140
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:23,284
do you do that?
And it never seems to be what I want to 

1141
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:25,830
do.

1142
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,630
And their advice is coming from a 
different world,

1143
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,190
you know,
and they mean well,

1144
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,443
but they're coming from the whole other 
value system at a whole other 

1145
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:37,290
expectation of their own lives and what 
your life should be in all of that.

1146
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,350
And all of it is,
it's not poisoned,

1147
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,580
but it says kind of,
uh,

1148
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,533
a naphtha to every breath you're taking 
and is ultimately useless because 

1149
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,450
they're always going to tote that line.
That's what they've got.

1150
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:50,220
Like you've got what you've got.
So when you say,

1151
00:49:50,221 --> 00:49:51,360
here's how I do it,
they're like,

1152
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,463
you're crazy man.
And then you look at them in that job 

1153
00:49:54,031 --> 00:49:54,850
and you're like,
the,

1154
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:55,683
you're the crazy wasn't amongst us 
because I couldn't handle wearing that 

1155
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:00,120
tie everyday and taking it from that 
dude.

1156
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:00,930
Yeah.

1157
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,270
And some people are just like the 
corporate world.

1158
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,133
I just,
I got lucky and I found a bunch of shit 

1159
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:08,300
that I like and if you had said to me,
you know,

1160
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,890
if you asked me if I was outside of my 
life,

1161
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:11,943
if I didn't know that I existed,
and you said you think it's possible to 

1162
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,650
be a cage fighting commentator slash 
standup comedian,

1163
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:17,820
I'd be like,
no,

1164
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,653
no,
they don't go together when you travel 

1165
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,040
and they say they,
they,

1166
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,120
they say occupation,
what do you.

1167
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,890
Right,
that's a good question.

1168
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,010
What do I do if

1169
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,910
I'm going somewhere for the ufc,
I always write ufc commentator.

1170
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:32,744
OkAy.
The easiest one to do because then they 

1171
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,131
go,
oh yeah,

1172
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,780
I know you.
And then they let me in and it's easy,

1173
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,670
you know,
if you're getting your passport stamped,

1174
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,200
but most of the time I write comic stand
up comedIan.

1175
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,270
Okay.
Yeah.

1176
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,373
Yeah.
So that's one thing that I definitely 

1177
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:45,884
do.
It's that everything else I could kind 

1178
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,980
of quit and even that I could kind of 
quit.

1179
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,870
You know what I mean?
You kind of quit everything.

1180
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:52,430
Yeah.
Sometimes.

1181
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:56,990
Maybe it's a good idea to clear the 
decks citizen of the world.

1182
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,090
That's what I would say,
professIonal citizen of the world.

1183
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,153
Yeah,
and also I think if there's a bravery 

1184
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:08,420
that one takes when one embraces the 
straight world that I simply don't have.

1185
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,830
There's a level of guts where you're 
like,

1186
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:12,080
well,
I don't really like this job,

1187
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:12,914
but I love my family.
I'm going to do the rIght thing and I 

1188
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,550
don't have a family,
so I don't really.

1189
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:17,384
I'm not tethered to that value.
I admire it and if I was a dad I'd be 

1190
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:20,924
standing up,
but there a kind of guts where you just 

1191
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:25,310
get on that bus every day like,
damn man,

1192
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,233
I don't like this job and you grimly 
hold onto your sack lunch and you just 

1193
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:32,780
go do it.
I think like my mom and my dad,

1194
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:33,883
I don't know them that well,
but they were very hardworking people 

1195
00:51:36,531 --> 00:51:40,730
and I'm not sure how much they ever 
really loved their jobs.

1196
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,290
Like I can't wait to go to the office.

1197
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,690
They just kind of what I'm an adult and 
this is what you do.

1198
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:45,524
And they just kinda put,
put themselves through that grinder and 

1199
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,450
turn the handle themselves and they just
get,

1200
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,493
I think a lot of people all over the 
world is kinda grimly set their jaw and 

1201
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,200
go,
I'm an adult,

1202
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,063
uh,
and they go out into it and you look at 

1203
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:04,100
a guy like iggy pop who could never have
a straight job.

1204
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,170
It would just be the thing would fall 
over because he's an artIst too.

1205
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:11,450
He's the real thing and it's,
it's innovation,

1206
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:15,140
but it's an intolerance and it's for me,
a,

1207
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,620
just a lack of courage to tow that line.
I'm like,

1208
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:19,700
man,
I just don't have it.

1209
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:23,690
I don't have the stamina to go into that
building every day for 28 years.

1210
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,910
Like my dad went to one building for his
whole life was one c,

1211
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:29,540
one corporation he worked for.
And then he stopped.

1212
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,433
I don't know if he's alive or dead,
but he was that guy in that building 

1213
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:35,840
every damn day,
like hours and hours.

1214
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,710
There is a dance that when you discuss 
these things,

1215
00:52:38,711 --> 00:52:42,880
like you don't want to disparage anybody
that had genuinely has shown courage and

1216
00:52:42,881 --> 00:52:45,100
grinding it out because for their 
families does

1217
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,970
take courage.
I just don't have it.

1218
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I'm saying I consider them people in the
real world and in my life,

1219
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:55,820
I don't think I really live in the real 
world that much.

1220
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,370
I live in myself,
invented henry world.

1221
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,540
Right.
And uh,

1222
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:03,530
I saw this video with lady gaga.
I don't know much about our music,

1223
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,200
but she did this long intro,
the $80 million dollar thing.

1224
00:53:06,201 --> 00:53:09,470
And she said she feels like reality.
I hate reality.

1225
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:11,150
I was like,
there you go.

1226
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:14,930
I just can't handle a lot of it and I 
don't shy away from it.

1227
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,280
I go into situations that are hyper 
real,

1228
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,870
but I'm that kind of flatline existence 
that a lot of we adults engage in.

1229
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:24,583
I think that would have destroyed me.
I would've found alcohol or something 

1230
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:30,060
really destructive.
Yeah.

1231
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:33,320
It's a droning,
resonating existences.

1232
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,313
Bob,

1233
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:36,370
yeah,
and some people go,

1234
00:53:36,371 --> 00:53:37,204
hey,
suck it up and you'll get get in there 

1235
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:41,710
and it's not that bad.
Share up and it's not that bad.

1236
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,760
I just don't want it.
I just want,

1237
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,280
I don't want it malleable.
They,

1238
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,300
some people can get through it.
Yeah,

1239
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,420
they have,
they just have a different mind.

1240
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:54,910
But if you were like,
if you had a friend that was doing that,

1241
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:55,744
but you know,
that friend really wanted to be a 

1242
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:57,484
novelist,
will you just fucking go to try to poke 

1243
00:54:02,411 --> 00:54:05,890
in your spare time but get out of there.
But the thing is you've said that to him

1244
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:06,990
or her before.
Right?

1245
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,130
And like these people write me,
hey man,

1246
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,050
my band is pretty good.
Should I,

1247
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,973
I'm two years into college.
Should I quit college and take my band 

1248
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,334
on the road?
And the truth is if that person really 

1249
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:21,190
had the thing,
they wouldn't be writing me.

1250
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,380
They would just be telling me when they 
were playing.

1251
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,210
Yeah.
I never asked for advice.

1252
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:26,443
I never,
I just said either I'm going to play 

1253
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:29,284
this music or I'm going to die tryIng.
It never occurred to me that there's 

1254
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,150
asked advice about what and so I,
I never had any fear.

1255
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:41,470
I ran at it and I didn't care if there 
was a wall there or the cops I just ran.

1256
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,410
But surely you must have had heroes that
did it also before you.

1257
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:47,500
So you felt like death?
No,

1258
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:48,341
no,
not definitely.

1259
00:54:48,341 --> 00:54:51,100
Not like you did it,
but a lot of rock stars,

1260
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:52,570
a lot of bands,
a lot of musicians,

1261
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:54,610
a lot of artists.
They pursued their goals.

1262
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:57,130
They went out and chase things and we 
knew that it was a path.

1263
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,310
The ones I had met before I was doing 
music full time.

1264
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:01,150
We're all broke.

1265
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,490
Like I met some punk rock bands like 
from england,

1266
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,130
you know,
like whoever and you're like,

1267
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,020
yeah,
you're broke Too.

1268
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,040
And they're just crazy people.
And I identified with that,

1269
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,770
but sometimes if,
if,

1270
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,370
if you eVer been done a show where you 
meet that,

1271
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:23,430
that actor who has had like 80 years of 
acting class and all,

1272
00:55:23,771 --> 00:55:26,430
they talk about their acting coach and 
I,

1273
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,333
after I get off the set today,
I'm going to go back to my class and 

1274
00:55:28,901 --> 00:55:31,030
like all they do is take classes.
You're like,

1275
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,010
man,
if you're all you're going to do is ever

1276
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:34,450
take classes,
you're never going to.

1277
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:35,703
The rubber's never going to hit the road
because you're always in the on pause 

1278
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:40,690
with the acting.
Some days you just gotta go like,

1279
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:43,810
I'm doing this.
And like that's me.

1280
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,160
And if it doesn't work,
man,

1281
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:46,120
it's really going to hurt.

1282
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,950
Yeah.
So here we go.

1283
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:49,720
Like with music,
I never like,

1284
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,280
oh,
are we going to make it make what?

1285
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,293
I'm just trying to do a good shot.
I never thought I would ever make money 

1286
00:55:54,461 --> 00:55:55,294
doing music.
I never thought I'd ever be able to pay 

1287
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:57,364
my rent.
I just reconciled my life to a life of 

1288
00:55:59,051 --> 00:56:04,051
fighting bad tasting food and sleeping 
next to the drummer,

1289
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:06,910
snored all night in the back of the van 
hoping the bass,

1290
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,400
the bass player,
the guitar player didn't drive this into

1291
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:11,770
a tree because we didn't have a driver.
It is what it is.

1292
00:56:11,771 --> 00:56:15,070
It's independent music and you just 
crawl through these tours that makes you

1293
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:15,904
pretty tough like a junk yard dog.
But I never thought it would ever 

1294
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:19,534
change.
I just figured this is your life and 

1295
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:21,580
eventually,
you know,

1296
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:24,940
the guy hits you with something and you 
die in the hospital.

1297
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,580
I just was not a fatalist but I'm like,
this is it.

1298
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,170
And I never saw past that.
And then in the eighties,

1299
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:34,090
you know,
the band got bigger or whatever.

1300
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,130
Um,
but I,

1301
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,990
I've always run it things going,
well,

1302
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:38,824
this is,
this is it or die or I never thought 

1303
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,470
there was any wiggle room or any cushion
or much alternative.

1304
00:56:44,471 --> 00:56:46,750
I'm not that resourceful.
I'm just kind of,

1305
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,880
you know,
crazy enough to run at it.

1306
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,880
And by running a really hard,
I've gotten through it,

1307
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,950
but it's not because I'm smart or good 
looking,

1308
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:57,100
it's just because as richard gere once 
said,

1309
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:57,934
I've got nowhere else to go and that has
really helped me where I'm going to get 

1310
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:02,680
through this tour.
So I got nothing else going on.

1311
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,530
I'll stay in this band because I got 
nowhere else to go.

1312
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,364
But being this incredibly hard to be in 
band and that's been very helpful to me 

1313
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:12,280
like this.
This really hurts.

1314
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:16,240
Well that's better than the painted 
standing there with the apron behind the

1315
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,980
counter.
That was a different kind of pain.

1316
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,740
Yeah.
But you've managed to transcend that,

1317
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:21,633
obviously

1318
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:22,643
managed to find this very unique path in
life where you're doing all these 

1319
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:29,490
different things.
You're not no longer in a band anymore.

1320
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:33,990
And now you're this worLdwide travelers 
slash performance artists.

1321
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,060
Were you doing these spoken word things 
or.

1322
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,303
They're really funny.
It's kind of like stand up and I had a 

1323
00:57:38,941 --> 00:57:39,960
lot of comedy.
Yeah.

1324
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:43,680
I had a bought a couple of your cds way 
back in the day.

1325
00:57:43,681 --> 00:57:45,150
It was like in the nineties.
And uh,

1326
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,700
cause I thought it was music and uh,
I saw that you were.

1327
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,730
And then as a spoken word like what the 
fuck is this?

1328
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:51,980
And I listed,
I was like,

1329
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,400
it's this kinda like,
stand up.

1330
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,560
But,
but in a freer form.

1331
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:56,620
Yeah.
More anecdotal.

1332
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,190
Yeah.
Now,

1333
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,200
did you do,
did you,

1334
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,330
when did you start doing that?
That many,

1335
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:02,164
many years ago in 1983 a,
there was a local promoter in hollywood 

1336
00:58:05,831 --> 00:58:06,664
and he would take like 20 people it give
everyone five minutes and it'd be the 

1337
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:11,650
singer and the gun club.
The guy from the minute man,

1338
00:58:11,651 --> 00:58:13,570
the guy from this band,
the girl from that event.

1339
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,420
And I would go to these shows because 
even when was bad it was great.

1340
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:17,380
And everyone's cheering,
you know,

1341
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,180
all these people.
So if it sucked,

1342
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:19,990
you know,
you,

1343
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,823
you to applaud even harder black flags,
bass player would be on these gigs and 

1344
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:25,174
he'd go up and read from his notebook is
an amazing intellect and I would always 

1345
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,380
go hang out with him.
And,

1346
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,200
and one night the promoter said,
You got a big mouth.

1347
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,970
Let's get you up there next week,
and I go,

1348
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:34,440
ah,
yeah,

1349
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,230
when am I going to do?

1350
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,350
And he said like,
you know,

1351
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,740
10 minutes,
10 bucks or whatever it was.

1352
00:58:38,741 --> 00:58:41,170
I said,
I'll take that money and the next week I

1353
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,004
got up there and I read something that I
had written and told a story about what 

1354
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,124
had happened at band practice the day 
before when the white supremist try to 

1355
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:51,690
run over our guitar player with his car 
and the audit is like,

1356
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:52,840
I go,
yeah,

1357
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,430
that was tuesday in the life of black 
flag.

1358
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:55,600
Well my tIme is up.
I got to go.

1359
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,030
and so I walked off stage,
big applause,

1360
00:58:58,031 --> 00:58:59,890
and everyone came up to me and said,
when's your next show?

1361
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:00,911
I said,
well,

1362
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:03,400
I'm going on tour.
I thought they meant the band.

1363
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:05,680
They went under this the next year where
you just talk.

1364
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:06,281
I go,
well,

1365
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:07,990
I got this $10 bill.
That was it.

1366
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,690
And the promoter said,
you're really good at that.

1367
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,510
You're a natural.
How about you opened for two of my poets

1368
00:59:13,511 --> 00:59:17,920
next week we'll give you 15 minutes and 
a few times around the that there,

1369
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,754
those poets are opening for me,
whIch they didn't like and 1985 I had 

1370
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:23,684
done a cross country tour and you know,
12 to 15 people a night and they called 

1371
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:28,844
it spoken word,
which I thought there's a way to 

1372
00:59:29,871 --> 00:59:31,710
starvation was I don't want to go see a 
gig,

1373
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,740
this spoken word,
the snore fest,

1374
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,750
so I've always just called it a talking 
show.

1375
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,913
So I would read things and anecdote 
between pages and then one day I just 

1376
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:41,534
started,
stopped bringing the things to read on 

1377
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:43,910
stage and said,
look,

1378
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:44,743
here's what happened when I was in 
holland and the thing and I just tell 

1379
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:51,920
stories.
And by the late eighties I was doing the

1380
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,890
entire continent of europe,
scandinavia,

1381
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,450
Australia,
New Zealand,

1382
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,960
and then it went on and on with the last
tour is 19 countries and 165 shows.

1383
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:03,643
That's why I came back from last week.
It's like it traveled at comedies like 

1384
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:08,600
me and a microphone and.
But I,

1385
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:09,703
it's more general admission theaters,
but every once in a while I'll do like 

1386
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,160
the melbourne comedy festival,
the sydney comedy festival,

1387
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:17,293
or like three nights of comedy and I'm 
like doing an hour on one of those 

1388
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:21,890
nights.
I did a comedy club on this last tour.

1389
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:22,724
There was a night off or doing a thing 
at the last bucket or one of those 

1390
01:00:25,581 --> 01:00:26,710
places.
And you know,

1391
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,030
with the pa,
the pa is like bolted into the wall.

1392
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:30,620
There's no monitors.
There's one light.

1393
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:34,030
And uh,
me and my big tour bus out front,

1394
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:37,390
it's like right next to the strip bar.
And I went in there and went,

1395
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,233
okay,
all those little eight by 10 frame 

1396
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:40,214
photos on the walls.
I don't go into places like this right 

1397
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,470
below me.

1398
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:45,230
It's just not my world.
Sold the place out.

1399
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,710
The audience couldn't have been nicer.
And the owner thanked me and I said,

1400
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:49,544
man,
if I'm ever back in this part of 

1401
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:52,820
Illinois,
I'll do this venue again.

1402
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:54,650
And he said,
we'll be here.

1403
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,353
And it was a really good time.
And so a lot of what I do kind of lends 

1404
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,104
itself to comedy in that life plus time 
most of the time it's funny and comedy 

1405
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,550
don't try and I don't write material 
really,

1406
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:12,970
but when you try things that are.
I just basically report on that which is

1407
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:18,041
funny and many things occur to me either
ultimately or eventually to be funny,

1408
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,013
like almost anything.
Then obviously some things are never 

1409
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:26,510
going to be funny,
but most things are like,

1410
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:29,180
I don't know which way your politics 
lean that much,

1411
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,190
but you can look at the president 
administration go like eat,

1412
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,130
we're all going down the drain.

1413
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:34,821
Or you can go,
man,

1414
01:01:34,821 --> 01:01:35,654
this is the lowest hanging fruit.
This students has jumped up on a table 

1415
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:41,600
onto the silver platter with his ass in 
the air and an apple already.

1416
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:44,060
His mouth like,
this is going to be great.

1417
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:46,970
Like he's serving himself.
He's jumped into my lap.

1418
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,120
This is great.
And so there's different ways of looking

1419
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:50,954
at all of this.
And I guess comedians just look at 

1420
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,030
things differently.
I've met many of them.

1421
01:01:56,031 --> 01:01:56,864
I'm not one,
but there's a lot of comedy or at least 

1422
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,880
humorous moments that inform what I do 
on stage,

1423
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,410
which allows me to go for a long time 
onstage because they had no humor in it.

1424
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:07,244
It would be stultifying boring for me 
and for the audience and a lot of ways 

1425
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:12,440
when an administration has really fucked
up,

1426
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,550
comics do take joy in it because they 
know like,

1427
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:17,430
like when the book during the bush 
administration,

1428
01:02:17,431 --> 01:02:22,431
like there was eight years of gold and 
trump is that times five or 10,

1429
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,151
you know,
it's,

1430
01:02:23,151 --> 01:02:23,984
it's this,
but it's also when you find that gold 

1431
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:28,654
mine of humor,
it also equates on the other end to a 

1432
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:35,400
disastrous time for the country and 
that's where it gets scary.

1433
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,140
Environmentally.
It's getting scary.

1434
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:38,963
There was a,
there's a proposal now to get rid of 

1435
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,034
public lands and to,
to make public lands private and start 

1436
01:02:44,071 --> 01:02:48,150
tapping into them and sucking out the 
resources and ruin all these places that

1437
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:51,060
people go and hunt and fish and hike and
it's been,

1438
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:51,970
you know,
I,

1439
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:52,803
I think it's a really beautiful thing,
what they call the comments in this 

1440
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:56,664
country where you can go to the park and
I don't know if you ever spent time in 

1441
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:01,530
parks,
there's a decency that you'll often find

1442
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:02,813
where the family picks up the garbage 
and you'll even see the little kid 

1443
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:10,050
picking up the cup because it's our park
and I'm not mr kubiak necessarily,

1444
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:12,510
but I love that idea.
Like don't screw this up man.

1445
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:15,480
It's yours and mine and while we're 
here,

1446
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:16,613
let's cut the crap and be really cool to
each other and really appreciate these 

1447
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:20,490
trees.

1448
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,040
So I grew up in Washington dc and you've
been there.

1449
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,190
It's a small town,
dropped into a park.

1450
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,053
Everywhere you go,
you run into a deciduous tree and he's 

1451
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:31,900
rock creek park with the white house 
near it.

1452
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:32,743
I mean it's just park park park.
And so I grew up every day I'm outside 

1453
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:36,473
looking at bats and finding toads and 
like outside of my apartment is a park 

1454
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,053
and I was outside all the time and I 
really came to love that ethic of this 

1455
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:46,104
is ours,
like when you're on the subways and in 

1456
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:49,330
Russia there's no garbage.
She,

1457
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,800
they really take pride in their soul 
with their beautiful and it's our subway

1458
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,280
don't litter.
And I,

1459
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:55,183
I think there's a rectitude and a moral 
decency that we americans skew towards 

1460
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:03,990
when we're in these places that we're 
all somewhat responsible for.

1461
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,460
And to take that away.

1462
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,170
When everything becomes me,
mine,

1463
01:04:07,171 --> 01:04:09,000
I drew the line,
you step over to kill you,

1464
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:11,430
all that stuff.
It doesn't bring out the best in us.

1465
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:16,910
And I think those public lands are 
really part of what keeps us from,

1466
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,960
you know,
going crazy and to see them the,

1467
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:21,930
you know,
because you know,

1468
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:22,764
there's,
there's people like trump who look at 

1469
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:25,170
central park,
go,

1470
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:27,030
what a waste,
what a waste.

1471
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,873
The it.
I can put nine hotels for casinos in a 

1472
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:32,370
theme park in there.
Well,

1473
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,323
teddy roosevelt and a lot of the people 
that established the national park 

1474
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:38,520
system in this country many,
many years ago,

1475
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,443
they had an incredible vision.
They realized that we have this amazing 

1476
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:43,164
landscape and they decided to preserve 
it and put it in the trust of the 

1477
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:47,754
public,
make it a public thing where anyone can 

1478
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:51,540
go,
anyone can go and hike,

1479
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,680
anyone can go and and some beautiful 
things.

1480
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,560
Amazing and it doesn't exist anywhere 
else.

1481
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,423
It's a really,
really rare resource that we have here 

1482
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,020
in America and right now during this 
administration,

1483
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:02,600
we're in danger of losing that.
It's,

1484
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,890
it's very scary.
You know,

1485
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:04,724
it's,
you know,

1486
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:05,963
not wanting to get up every day with a 
hate list of people and I don't think 

1487
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:12,360
Donald Trump wakes up every day going,
how can I screw up a bunch of people?

1488
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,253
I reallY don't think that's on his menu,
but I do think he's a businessman who's 

1489
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:21,820
looking to make deals that the tell for 
me was when the president said,

1490
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,900
if vladimir putin agrees to help us in 
the fight against isis,

1491
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:29,050
I'll consider lifting those sanctions.
It's nOt,

1492
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:29,980
you know,
we'll make a deal.

1493
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:30,820
He does that,
I'll do this,

1494
01:05:30,821 --> 01:05:31,780
we'll get that here,
gets that.

1495
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:33,730
That's a deal.
He's a deal maker.

1496
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's not really a deal in global 
affairs necessarily all the time.

1497
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,083
Certainly not with that guy on that 
particular issue and I think he's kind 

1498
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:49,621
of tone deaf to some of the more nuanced
things that it takes to be America in an

1499
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,573
ever more interconnected world with 
evermore diminishing resources and to 

1500
01:05:58,631 --> 01:06:03,631
start privatizing a America chopping up 
the parks and all that.

1501
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,660
It's real sad if that happens is I 
really enjoy,

1502
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:10,240
uh,
being able to go into a place like I can

1503
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:11,074
walk in here or even though I grew up as
a shy kid who didn't play well with 

1504
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:15,694
others,
so I would go to the library all the 

1505
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:17,704
time that,
that library card and I can take this 

1506
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:20,441
book home.
Well,

1507
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:21,610
yeah,
you got to take care of it.

1508
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,830
Okay.
And I read the book and take it back.

1509
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:25,900
All thoSe alfred hitchcock,
you know,

1510
01:06:25,901 --> 01:06:29,230
stories for kids or whatever.
I read all that stuff and the library is

1511
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:31,390
a big deal for me because I felt like an
adult.

1512
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,550
I have my card,
I can walk into this massive,

1513
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:38,560
interesting smelling cool building and 
it's mine.

1514
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,453
The whole thing is my.
I couldn't believe the freedom I had in 

1515
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:43,840
there.
These ancient seats in the place smelled

1516
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:47,770
of books and it was mine.
I never got my head.

1517
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:48,873
It was never not amazing to me to walk 
into the library and like any damn book 

1518
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:54,280
I want,
I can walk into any section and no one's

1519
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:54,761
going,
hey kid,

1520
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:55,730
get out of here.
Right?

1521
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:56,733
And I.
That's what you get in a park and you 

1522
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:00,820
know when you're in New York,
there's a lot of that.

1523
01:07:00,821 --> 01:07:01,301
They're like,
look,

1524
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:02,830
it's our sidewalk.
It's our subway.

1525
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:04,630
Be cool man.
And there's a.

1526
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:06,850
There's an inherit a lot of people fear 
in New York.

1527
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:07,684
If they never spent time there and 
there's an inherent decency amongst new 

1528
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:14,140
yorkers because you are so smashed 
together,

1529
01:07:14,141 --> 01:07:16,230
you're going to make human contact,
right?

1530
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,220
You're going to bump into someone.
That is what it is,

1531
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:21,070
so you better bring some humor and a 
little bit of like,

1532
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:23,710
hey,
it's okay and I see that in new yorkers,

1533
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,983
just really great greatness and when you
you make us cheap and petty and we 

1534
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,473
turned into some twilight zone episode.
That is what I fear in this country is 

1535
01:07:35,171 --> 01:07:36,004
us kind of cheating ourselves out of how
great we are when you don't scare the 

1536
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:40,810
crap out of us all the time.

1537
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:41,790
Yeah.
Well,

1538
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,830
I mean trump has just such a polarizing 
figure.

1539
01:07:44,831 --> 01:07:45,664
I hope that it unites us in a lot of 
ways so we realize how good we have it 

1540
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:50,794
and we realize what really is important 
and that having this guy who so many 

1541
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:55,444
people were opposed to and having these 
policies at so many people are opposed 

1542
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,193
to even if you're not opposed to him.
I know a lot of people that supported 

1543
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:03,850
him that now looking at some of these 
policies,

1544
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:06,460
particularly the public land policy and 
they're kind of freaking out.

1545
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:07,953
I think a lot of that is gonna unite 
folks and it's gonna make people 

1546
01:08:10,751 --> 01:08:14,090
understand what is important.
Like that gigantic women's march here.

1547
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,340
That was impressive.
Incredibly impressive.

1548
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:18,800
I mean,
who saw that coming out of nowhere.

1549
01:08:18,830 --> 01:08:19,663
I mean one,
one statement that he makes goofing 

1550
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:22,770
around with,
uh,

1551
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:27,770
a guy that Billy Bush character on a bus
essentially led to that movement.

1552
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:28,934
Otherwise,
why else would it be a only a woman's 

1553
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:32,504
march when he gets an office?
It Was because he's got this perceived 

1554
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:37,610
attitude about women and this is a 
rejection of that.

1555
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,780
Yeah.
And uh,

1556
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,280
I think he's getting used to being on 
the global stage where,

1557
01:08:42,281 --> 01:08:43,111
you know,
every hIccup,

1558
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:48,111
every cough shifts the world's markets.
And I think other presidents have rocked

1559
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:50,844
that responsibility far more gracefully.
Even presidents I don't necessarily 

1560
01:08:54,271 --> 01:08:55,104
agree with.
They really understood the awesome 

1561
01:08:57,241 --> 01:08:58,074
weight of that job and they really kind 
of feared it and tried their best even 

1562
01:09:01,741 --> 01:09:03,720
presence I whose policies I disagree 
with,

1563
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,820
I think they really got the magnitude.

1564
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:09,700
When you think about your life,
where you have this wander last and this

1565
01:09:09,701 --> 01:09:10,534
passion for exploring new environments 
and learning about new cultures and you 

1566
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:14,564
know,
and you were also talking about just 

1567
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:16,653
the,
the fucking great poll of death because 

1568
01:09:19,901 --> 01:09:20,734
it is there and it's always to be 
considered when you're looking at a guy 

1569
01:09:22,601 --> 01:09:26,350
like that who was older than us.
He's 70 something years old,

1570
01:09:26,351 --> 01:09:30,220
right?
And that fucking life is a meat grinder.

1571
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:34,950
That job is the greatest aging job 
you've ever seen.

1572
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,110
People.
We've seen people go in and they see the

1573
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:41,450
beat barack obama before and after 
pictures know it.

1574
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:45,080
That's crazy.
So what is going to happen to trump?

1575
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:48,970
I mean he's a fucking old man already 
with bad die and why?

1576
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,210
Like what is what,
when you have $4,000,000,000

1577
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,073
or whatever the fuck he has,
when you have your name on all these 

1578
01:09:55,061 --> 01:09:55,894
buildings all over the world.
Like what is the motivation to continue 

1579
01:09:58,761 --> 01:09:58,930
that?

1580
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,763
That that's what I've.
I've always wondered with the koch 

1581
01:10:01,711 --> 01:10:04,020
brothers,
like the two angriest man in America and

1582
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,330
in the obama,
the tyranny of obama,

1583
01:10:06,331 --> 01:10:07,890
they'd always opine about like,
dude,

1584
01:10:07,891 --> 01:10:11,340
you got $34,000,000,000
you can have me killed right now and all

1585
01:10:11,341 --> 01:10:16,020
the pizza you want and what?
Why are we so angry again?

1586
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:16,881
Oh,
well,

1587
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:18,720
where's,
where's the tyranny in your life?

1588
01:10:18,721 --> 01:10:23,460
thIrty 4 billion a shut up.
And I think with some people,

1589
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:26,670
I did a movie many years ago,
one of the first ones I was ever in with

1590
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:30,840
a very big movie star and someone told 
me how much he makes in a year.

1591
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:33,270
And I went,
that's wow,

1592
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:37,080
and why does he,
what's up with that?

1593
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,831
He said,
well,

1594
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:40,920
all his friends have 100 million and so 
he wants to catch up.

1595
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,203
I said,
but after the first 50 and it's like 

1596
01:10:43,921 --> 01:10:45,600
going out in the rain while you're 
soaking wet,

1597
01:10:45,601 --> 01:10:46,020
going out.

1598
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,850
It's raining like pal,
your warranty wet.

1599
01:10:47,851 --> 01:10:50,640
Like what do you do with the other 80 
billion?

1600
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:52,020
Like what?
What is it?

1601
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:53,243
And I think with some people it's maybe 
coming from some knowing insecurity and 

1602
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,320
nothing's ever big enough like you've 
been around famous people.

1603
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:06,830
I've met a number of big actors or big 
rock stars and the big,

1604
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:09,690
the bigger the rock star,
it just my experience,

1605
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:10,853
the bigger the rock star,
the more humble and cool are the more 

1606
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,073
they love music and they're like,
they're humble in front of it and they 

1607
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:18,990
ask what you're doing.
And,

1608
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,450
and I've met some,
I've been lucky,

1609
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:23,310
I've met a lot of my rock heroes and 
they're like,

1610
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:27,150
just really hoping.
Like I met george carlin once,

1611
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:28,433
I just on the beacon theater and he was 
about to go do one of hIs hbo specials 

1612
01:11:30,831 --> 01:11:31,830
there.
And he said,

1613
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:33,840
did,
did people get the jokes?

1614
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:35,000
I said,
what do you mean?

1615
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,110
So people understand you when you're 
onstage,

1616
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,150
do you eat?
Do you think it'll be okay?

1617
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:40,173
I was like,
you're asking me if your show will be 

1618
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:45,120
okay,
your church fricken carla and man,

1619
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:46,620
I mean like,
are you kidding?

1620
01:11:46,980 --> 01:11:50,940
And to see that kind of not insecurity 
with that kind of like,

1621
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:52,410
hey,
did it go okay?

1622
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:54,450
Because I got to go there next,
yikes.

1623
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,940
Like george carlin,
you walk on water,

1624
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,013
but the fact that he was still wanting 
it to be okay that he didn't think I've 

1625
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,670
got this on george carlin.
I was like,

1626
01:12:02,671 --> 01:12:03,780
damn,
he still open.

1627
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:07,020
He still look knowing that it could go 
south.

1628
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:07,854
You might have a stinking night while 
the cameras are on and he's still fears 

1629
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:13,290
having a bad show.
It means so much to him.

1630
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:18,570
And I think if you're in that mode,
you can greet the day better.

1631
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,400
But when you look at things like,
well,

1632
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:21,234
I don't have as much as he has or some 
guy made a nasty tweet about me and I'm 

1633
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:27,210
going to get on twitter and answer back.
Oh no.

1634
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,850
And I'm the president.
No nothing.

1635
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:34,380
The point I'm making is nothing satiates
that thirst,

1636
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:35,753
like the,
he's in the top executive slot and he's 

1637
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:42,410
still probably grumbling about something
or just wanting to win.

1638
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,400
Uh,
and now that he's got it,

1639
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:46,170
I,
when he did his acceptance speech,

1640
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:48,990
I was in Washington on the night of the 
election onstage at the lincoln theater.

1641
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,123
I watched the whole damn thing until 
five in the morning when he made his 

1642
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:55,180
acceptance speech and the look on his 
face on the,

1643
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,153
on mr trump's face was a wow.
I've just saw off a big chunk of meat 

1644
01:12:59,701 --> 01:13:01,860
for myself.
Oh no,

1645
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,510
it wasn't joy.
it was like,

1646
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:05,610
now I got to go to all those meetIngs.

1647
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,770
Oh damn.
This is a big dog I just bought.

1648
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:09,730
This is a lot,
a lot of,

1649
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,710
you know,
a big deal.

1650
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,830
And I just,
I think one of the ways he's,

1651
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,890
he'll escape the stress of it is I think
he'll put it off on other people.

1652
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,840
He'll delegate.
Mike pence will be,

1653
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:19,674
it'll be president pence and you know,
the other guy just looking good for the 

1654
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:24,144
cameras.
And so I think that's how he'll get 

1655
01:13:25,741 --> 01:13:26,574
through it because it destroyed bush.
eight years of the presidency took bush 

1656
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,380
was a very handsome man.
When he walked into office,

1657
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:33,660
he came out of there destroyed and it 
was far younger.

1658
01:13:33,661 --> 01:13:34,494
Right.
How old was bush when he was in his 

1659
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:37,620
fifties when he got into office?
Late forties,

1660
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:40,080
I think a little older than Mr.
Obama.

1661
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:45,470
And obama to heroin gray,
he just got skinnier somehow just get so

1662
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:46,040
tired.

1663
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,410
It's just because you don't get saying 
this on stage the other night,

1664
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,620
the presidents don't get that.
Three in the morning phone call,

1665
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:53,760
mr.
President,

1666
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,720
uh,
in Maine,

1667
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,930
the cat that was in the tray,
the fire department got the cat down.

1668
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:59,550
The cat's fine.
God bless you.

1669
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,760
God bless the United States of America.
They get come down to the situation room

1670
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:03,594
and look at the high resolution video 
footage of the girls and tests and 

1671
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:08,310
sailing through the air for the drone 
strike that went.

1672
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,283
It's zig when it should have zagged.
They get bad news and then they gut 

1673
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:13,600
wrenching decisions where they log.
Yep,

1674
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:14,463
go,
we're going in and all those people are 

1675
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:18,760
going to die.
That there's every president makes those

1676
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:21,310
decisions and it's a job.
You'd have to.

1677
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:24,520
You couldn't pay me enough that I 
wouldn't want a day of it.

1678
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:30,090
And I think you either have to be either
a nut or truly think I've got this.

1679
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:35,440
I'm neither a.
And so I'm not that kind of megalomaniac

1680
01:14:35,441 --> 01:14:36,274
and I just don't ever think I got it.
And I don't know what trump is going to 

1681
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:40,834
do with a job that has not.
you see the last days of johnson and he 

1682
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:48,010
didn't even serve two terms,
like via the Vietnam war,

1683
01:14:48,011 --> 01:14:51,460
destroyed johnson.
His face was falling off his sculpt,

1684
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:55,300
those sad shots of him and mcnamara in 
the situation room with his,

1685
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:59,170
his,
his hand is on his cheek and his face is

1686
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:03,130
falling down his chest because every one
of those deaths I think really aggrieved

1687
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:03,993
the presIdent.
He's an interesting president of the 

1688
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:07,540
more you read about him,
more interesting he becomes.

1689
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:11,530
But I think it's a job that fairly 
destroys.

1690
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,320
The only one that didn't seem to really 
destroy was clinton.

1691
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:15,663
I don't dunno why.
He seemed to kind of walk out of there 

1692
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:17,831
like,
you know,

1693
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:19,150
hey,
yeah,

1694
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,710
but he looks like shit now.

1695
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:22,480
Well,
I mean he's paid for it now.

1696
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,373
yeah.
But some sort of the last few 

1697
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:25,743
presidents,
it's damn stressful being running this 

1698
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:29,790
country.
And,

1699
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,690
and because we're so free,
I mean,

1700
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:34,780
you've traveled.
No country in the world enjoys our level

1701
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:37,990
of freedom and not our kind of freedom 
like even Germany,

1702
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:39,100
england,
where you know,

1703
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,980
it's the western world is free,
is not nearly as free as this,

1704
01:15:42,490 --> 01:15:46,300
and we're so free to try and tell us 
what to do.

1705
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:47,134
you don't tell an american what to do 
and sadly the president is part of the 

1706
01:15:50,831 --> 01:15:51,664
federal government and so the states are
already pissed off at you and any 

1707
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:55,541
president,
you know,

1708
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,250
you get bucketed,
you went on vacation.

1709
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:57,971
Well,
it's christmAs.

1710
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,310
How dare you go on vacation?
Uh,

1711
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,760
I went to my momma's house.
Oh,

1712
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,080
you're seeing your mom now.
I mean,

1713
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,103
think a president can do where half the 
country doesn't get mad and we'll see 

1714
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:09,670
how our new president takes It.

1715
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,533
I want them to be successful because I 
want every boat in America to be lifted 

1716
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:15,460
by the tide.
I want good for people.

1717
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:17,020
I disagree with people.
I'm not.

1718
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:18,240
That guy was the same.
Yeah.

1719
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:19,074
I don't want some state to go into the 
toilet because they don't read good or 

1720
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:24,760
something.
That's just not how I want to run it.

1721
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:25,743
Well,
I like the fact that he's talking about 

1722
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,334
rebuilding the infrastructure and 
putting people to work in that regard 

1723
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:32,200
and rebuilding a menu of american 
manufacturing.

1724
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:33,034
I hope that really does happen and 
people do get good jobs and the economy 

1725
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,500
does rise up.
What I worry about is all this corporate

1726
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:39,334
raider mentality backed by these people 
that think that he's somehow or another 

1727
01:16:43,241 --> 01:16:45,550
looking out for the little guy.
Like I just,

1728
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,290
I just wonder,
you know,

1729
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:50,890
I wonder what his motivations are and I 
wonder what houses all gonna play out,

1730
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:52,500
but I guess everybody does,
but you know,

1731
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,220
to me when someone says,
oh,

1732
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:55,810
this,
this new president,

1733
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,040
what he's doing is unprecedented.

1734
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,641
I'm like,
no,

1735
01:16:57,641 --> 01:17:00,970
america's have broken 45.
We just keep repeating.

1736
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:06,040
Trickle down economics would more parts 
or less parts per million in that.

1737
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:09,830
In the early days of slavery,
to be well landed.

1738
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:12,500
Gentry in America was great.
You bought land,

1739
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:15,200
you bought the materials,
and you built your plantation.

1740
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,350
You bought livestock,
human and animal.

1741
01:17:18,351 --> 01:17:20,150
When they bred,
you kept the offspring,

1742
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:21,740
human,
offspring,

1743
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:22,574
chickens,
all of It was yours and you got free 

1744
01:17:25,281 --> 01:17:26,870
labor.
Things were great until 18,

1745
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:28,340
65,
the 13th amendment,

1746
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:29,473
the abolishment of slavery,
and so that mentality of like you had a 

1747
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,580
good day to day because I didn't beat 
you.

1748
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:38,060
That's your good day and here's your 
rule and what do I pay you?

1749
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:38,993
Your here's your rule,
get back to the field and have another 

1750
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:43,190
day where I don't beat you.
That's a good day for you.

1751
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:48,020
That was an un bothered road to a brutal
utopia.

1752
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,290
And what you have over the years as 
these speed bumps,

1753
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:52,303
civil rights,
and that's where you get 

1754
01:17:54,981 --> 01:17:57,590
institutionalized apartheid.
You get jim crow,

1755
01:17:57,591 --> 01:17:58,424
you get an expansion of the clinton,
you get segregatIonist laws that sat on 

1756
01:18:01,281 --> 01:18:03,670
the books until like brown v board of 
education,

1757
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:05,450
1954,
uh,

1758
01:18:06,770 --> 01:18:08,840
Virginia versus,
uh,

1759
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:10,700
uh,
what v Virginia,

1760
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:14,120
that's the message donation laws,
1967,

1761
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,490
oboe,
obergefell v hodges,

1762
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:20,540
marriage equality 2015.
And these are speed bumps.

1763
01:18:20,541 --> 01:18:21,374
If you're oppressive and you just want 
to get paid this guy what you feel like 

1764
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:25,394
giving him minimum wage and all that 
stuff is your enemy because you don't 

1765
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:31,730
want these people have been able to 
stand up.

1766
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,800
And when I think when Mr.
Trump said,

1767
01:18:33,801 --> 01:18:36,140
make America great again,
I hate to say,

1768
01:18:36,141 --> 01:18:36,974
I think he was talking about 18,
61 in the years before when I paid you 

1769
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:43,730
what I want it to.
It's my factory.

1770
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:48,230
How dare the government tell me what,
what to pay you minimum wage.

1771
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,150
That's what he means,
I think.

1772
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:51,984
What do you mean

1773
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:52,893
wait?
Like I don't want you to have a bad 

1774
01:18:53,411 --> 01:18:54,160
life,
but look,

1775
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,260
I have a great factor.
I'm giving you a great job.

1776
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:57,910
Here's what I'm going to pay.
Rejoice.

1777
01:18:57,911 --> 01:19:00,940
You've got a job.
But it's not enough to feed my family.

1778
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:01,630
Well,
you know,

1779
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:04,940
beans on the weekend shear up and I 
don't,

1780
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,490
I don't think he wakes up every day 
going like,

1781
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:09,790
I want to kill people.
I want to murder americans and have them

1782
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,670
have a crap life.
I just think he thinks like,

1783
01:19:12,671 --> 01:19:13,504
look,
we'll own stuff and you'll be the 

1784
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:18,250
benefIciary as it falls from my mouth 
and trickles down to you.

1785
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:22,190
You'll be happy that I have so much 
money because I'm a,

1786
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:23,920
a beneficence master.

1787
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:29,360
Now you're a guy that's really seen 
probably more of the world than one 10th

1788
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,040
of one percent of the population of 
America.

1789
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:33,990
I mean,
you've been to so many different places.

1790
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:34,890
Yeah.
Now,

1791
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:39,010
do you thInk that because of that,
you have a unique perspective on what is

1792
01:19:39,011 --> 01:19:43,420
possible today because like in 2017,
if you just live in America,

1793
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:44,254
this is the only thing you've known you 
think of the world is sort of this sort 

1794
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:47,014
of state that we exist in,
but you haven't gone in North Korea 

1795
01:19:49,211 --> 01:19:51,480
having on a Mongolia having gone to all 
these different places,

1796
01:19:51,481 --> 01:19:52,314
we see oppressive regimes.
You see very bizarre cultures where 

1797
01:19:55,571 --> 01:19:56,404
people are rigid in their ability to 
move around and rigid in their ability 

1798
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:00,814
to behave and express themselves.
And you see that that could have turned 

1799
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,470
out like that here,
you know,

1800
01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:06,420
but it didn't.
We,

1801
01:20:06,421 --> 01:20:08,160
we have this sort

1802
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,993
of experiment in self government and 
it's sort of hobbled along and patched 

1803
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,170
up with duct tape and gorilla glue,
but it's here.

1804
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:18,373
It's here we are a miracle.
The fact that there's not been a second 

1805
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:21,984
civil war,
more catastrophic than the first shows 

1806
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:24,984
you how amazing the constitution is and 
even though we disagree a lot between 

1807
01:20:28,981 --> 01:20:31,710
the states and all of that,
that we do ultImately get along.

1808
01:20:31,711 --> 01:20:34,200
we're all still united.
Who did we argue a lot,

1809
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:39,300
but we're still here and I did two years
of programming for the history channel.

1810
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:42,430
I was talking to one professor and he 
gave me that sent to me.

1811
01:20:42,431 --> 01:20:43,264
He goes like,
we are a miracle because think of all 

1812
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:50,181
the people in this country you disagree 
with and yet here we are and what I have

1813
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:51,144
found by travel is what humans can still
survive when somebody go like there's 

1814
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:56,810
poverty in America.

1815
01:20:56,830 --> 01:20:57,663
Sure there is,
but not poverty lIke you see in 

1816
01:20:59,431 --> 01:21:00,264
Bangladesh,
not poverty like you see in the streets 

1817
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:03,720
of cairo.
I mean there's.

1818
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,840
There's poverty that no american will 
ever experience on in this country.

1819
01:21:08,971 --> 01:21:11,760
It'll never happen.
Like no way.

1820
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:12,810
There's,
there's a,

1821
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:13,643
there's a,
a stick of poverty stick that this 

1822
01:21:16,291 --> 01:21:19,620
country will never really whooped with 
that for other people in the world.

1823
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,310
Millions of them.
That is their entire life.

1824
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,503
I was on a boat years ago on my way to 
timbuktu with this guy I traveled with 

1825
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:30,810
before,
a twitter egg man named mahmud.

1826
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:32,093
I've been to,
I went to the desert music festival 

1827
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:35,880
twice to see all these african is the 
desert music.

1828
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:37,950
There was a festival that had it.
They had in Mali,

1829
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,240
in the,
in the sahara desert.

1830
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:41,670
And now it's too dangerous of the 
festivals no more.

1831
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,250
But I went to go because I buy all these
records from molly and bands.

1832
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,730
So I wanted to go see them do it in the 
desert.

1833
01:21:47,731 --> 01:21:50,760
So I went in 2008,
nine or nine and 10,

1834
01:21:50,761 --> 01:21:52,610
something like that.
And Uh,

1835
01:21:52,611 --> 01:21:55,950
I went overland through doggone country 
one year and then the next year I hooked

1836
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:58,010
back up with this guy,
my mood,

1837
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,680
and we took the Niger river on a boat.
The guy chain smokes every day.

1838
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,551
And I said,
mark,

1839
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,590
mood man,
like you're a freaking chimney.

1840
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:05,910
Like,
what are you trying to do?

1841
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:07,530
And he laughed.
He said,

1842
01:22:07,531 --> 01:22:09,360
I'm like,
I'm 30.

1843
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:13,590
I was supposed to Be dead two years ago 
because people in his tribe get about 28

1844
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,760
to 30 years.
It is.

1845
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:16,500
Hunter laughed and kept smoking like 
okay.

1846
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:21,090
And so what I've learned by travel is 
what humans can still,

1847
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:24,210
how they can still live in spite of what
they,

1848
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:29,750
what their circumstances are and what 
that means to me when I get back here is

1849
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,430
you have a lot to lose.

1850
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:33,653
I mean iT can get so much worse and 
you'll still get by because he was just 

1851
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:40,380
so resourceful and were so tough.
But w,

1852
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,214
w we shouldn't ever have to go near that
because we're smarter than that and you 

1853
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,680
know,
me and this other guy might disagree and

1854
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:48,780
he might call me a bunch of nasty names 
on the internet,

1855
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:52,020
but ultimately does he really want to 
kill me?

1856
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:54,540
Nah.
If I was in a burning car,

1857
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:55,374
would he try and pull me out?
Probably If I had a sandwich and he was 

1858
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,280
hungry when I give him half.
Yeah.

1859
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,553
And I think to forget that aspect of us 
and since at least the bush 

1860
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,010
administration with the polarization in 
this country has been so extreme,

1861
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,293
I think we have started to forget that 
we can be there for each other and I'm 

1862
01:23:15,071 --> 01:23:16,870
not saying we all need to have a big 
group hug,

1863
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:20,360
but when we are having such vociferous 
dIsagreements about healthcare,

1864
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:23,140
we're talking about people being able to
stay alive.

1865
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:25,050
Why are we arguing?
Right?

1866
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:29,230
Instead of just making a system where 
like the little old lady doesn't have to

1867
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:33,610
be in fear of dying alone with heaters 
that don't work or whatever.

1868
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:34,391
Like,
come on,

1869
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:37,360
we have such a beautiful patch of land 
because you know,

1870
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:38,194
I've been all over the world.
There's some parts where people live 

1871
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:40,763
here.
What are you people doing here like 

1872
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:44,620
this?
This part of africa wants you dead.

1873
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:48,460
Why are you here as where we live,
where America by we are.

1874
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:51,820
This is one long vacation we have in 
America as far as climate.

1875
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:53,233
It gets cold,
but you can always boogie down the road 

1876
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,920
to miami in a greyhound bus in seven 
hours.

1877
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:58,180
Be on your shorts.
I mean,

1878
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:01,090
we've got a good here in every possible 
way.

1879
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:02,040
Yeah,
we,

1880
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,220
we certainly do.
We really do.

1881
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,263
Now.
I think it's really important what you 

1882
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:05,943
were talking about,
about people on the Internet and that 

1883
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,770
sort of bizarre communication that we 
experienced today.

1884
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,340
Yeah.
Do you remember pre-internet,

1885
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,690
me,
you were a grown man before the internet

1886
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:20,260
came around.
Don't you think that this,

1887
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,393
this existence that we have right now,
what we are sort of communicating 

1888
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:26,140
without looking at each other without 
being there,

1889
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,380
let's be really cowardly.
YeAh.

1890
01:24:28,390 --> 01:24:29,223
Without social cues,
without it feeling emotions because of 

1891
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:34,960
cruel statements without like looking 
each other in the eye.

1892
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:38,520
I don't really feel lIke we're designed 
to communicate like this and it's.

1893
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,413
well,
it's certainly goes against how I was 

1894
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:42,340
raised.
It's very strange.

1895
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:44,620
It's a very strange time in that regard.
Yeah,

1896
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:45,603
and it leads to a lot of pettiness and 
just really mean stuff where the issuer 

1897
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,910
of that,
whatever that means,

1898
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:52,803
email or whatever.
I wonder if they look back at that a 

1899
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,001
week later,
you're like,

1900
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:57,040
well man,
who was I that afternoon?

1901
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:57,874
Because you.
There's stuff you can read because it 

1902
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,570
peels the paint off your car.

1903
01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:04,210
I mean I go on these chat room websites 
and I just read.

1904
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,083
I don't ever post things.
I just read and when we had our last 

1905
01:25:07,481 --> 01:25:08,314
president,
there is things said about him and his 

1906
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,320
family.
You're like,

1907
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,570
did you just write?
That was depressing.

1908
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:13,713
Like I read like three hours one night 
and like a 2000 and something like a 

1909
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:18,790
baboon's.
Oh man.

1910
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,020
I mean it really like you.
That just happened.

1911
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:24,940
Like someone actually thinks that I 
don't know.

1912
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,273
Well,
what's interesting is when they get 

1913
01:25:26,651 --> 01:25:27,484
found out and someone exposes whoever 
wrote that and then they focus on them 

1914
01:25:30,161 --> 01:25:33,520
publicly and you see the scrutiny of 
thousands,

1915
01:25:33,521 --> 01:25:34,354
if not millions of people come down 
those folks and how they fuck those 

1916
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:39,760
people turn into that.
They turned into that same monster.

1917
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:40,803
They have the green light to go after 
that and and all of a sudden know it's 

1918
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,350
like a twilight zone episode.

1919
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,420
Like now you got the stick.
Like,

1920
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:47,650
you know,
why are you hitting that guy?

1921
01:25:47,651 --> 01:25:49,030
Because he was hitting a guy with a 
stick.

1922
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:54,040
And so I come and I'm sure you can 
identify with this,

1923
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:56,890
I come from the world of if you say 
something,

1924
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,750
that guy comes around the corner,
go like,

1925
01:25:58,751 --> 01:25:59,800
what'd you say?
Wham.

1926
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:04,220
And he just broke your face.
And so I never say anything about anyone

1927
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:09,260
not expecting to turn the corner and be 
face to face with that person.

1928
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:12,470
And so If I ever talked about a 
politician or you know,

1929
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:13,304
I had a lot of disagreements with judge 
scalia and people like that and I'd 

1930
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:17,324
write about it in the la weekly,
I would have loved to have debated the 

1931
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:20,654
14th amendment.
The antonin scalia has said it didn't 

1932
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:24,050
have any of the traction that I think it
does.

1933
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,530
And at any politician like bucket on,
including trump,

1934
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:32,150
which I have the 14th amendment again,
the four equal protection under the law.

1935
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:32,983
18,
68 is basically if you're born and 

1936
01:26:34,341 --> 01:26:35,174
raised here,
you get all the same protections as the 

1937
01:26:36,711 --> 01:26:39,140
wealthy land guy is basically slave 
protection.

1938
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,303
It was one that came after the 13th.
There was to shore up the 13th 

1939
01:26:42,381 --> 01:26:43,214
amendment.
SlaverY is my favorite amendment of the 

1940
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:46,850
constitution.
It's five clauses,

1941
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,250
the two,
three,

1942
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:50,084
four,
and five are basically governmental 

1943
01:26:51,351 --> 01:26:52,184
mechanics,
but it's the first paragraph and it's 

1944
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:55,310
beautiful.
Uh,

1945
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,173
the all,
all people born and naturalized in the 

1946
01:26:57,441 --> 01:26:58,274
United States are a resident of the 
United States and of the state wherein 

1947
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:03,100
they reside,
et cetera,

1948
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,943
et cetera.
And it's a beautiful thing and I think 

1949
01:27:06,831 --> 01:27:09,410
that was put in place to make sure 
racists,

1950
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,273
uh,
understood that the 13th amendment 

1951
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:14,220
wasn't going anywhere.
And that's what gives like,

1952
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,260
you know,
people like,

1953
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:16,370
well,
you're an anchor baby.

1954
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:18,620
That's just the 14th amendment and 
scalia didn't,

1955
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:21,210
he is a,
uh,

1956
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,170
a descent on obergefell v hodges.

1957
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,300
He came down very hard on the 14th 
amendment,

1958
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:27,950
which is my personal favorite.
So,

1959
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:33,290
but my rationale is if I talk about 
somebody,

1960
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,213
I expect to see that guy within five 
minutes and have to answer for what I 

1961
01:27:39,831 --> 01:27:40,850
said.
So I,

1962
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:43,380
I am very careful with what I say 
because I,

1963
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:44,223
I take responsibility for what I say.
Like you said something mean about dick 

1964
01:27:47,391 --> 01:27:48,051
cheney.
Yes,

1965
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:49,490
I did.
He's right over here.

1966
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:52,010
Really?
Can I talk please?

1967
01:27:52,011 --> 01:27:53,690
Let me,
I want to talk to him.

1968
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,490
If you stare at him,
he turned to stone.

1969
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,361
Well,
you know what I mean?

1970
01:27:56,361 --> 01:28:01,361
I just don't say anything that I'm not 
ready to because I just met ann coulter.

1971
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,630
No,
after you wrote that thing about her,

1972
01:28:03,631 --> 01:28:06,470
you know that thing I wrote about her 
and then there was a video.

1973
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:07,550
You writing it?
Yeah.

1974
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:09,110
Yeah.
I really,

1975
01:28:09,111 --> 01:28:11,000
really enjoyed that,
but thank you very much.

1976
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:12,770
I'd love to meet ann coulter and just,
you know,

1977
01:28:12,771 --> 01:28:14,420
spend an evening with her.
Just figure out,

1978
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,160
you know,
what the fuck is going on?

1979
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:18,530
He gets so much self loathing.
How do you do that?

1980
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,720
She's so odd.
I know one,

1981
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:24,080
a female comedian who I'm sure you're 
very well aware of.

1982
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,720
Um,
and she knows her well,

1983
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:27,583
you know,
they've met on like bill maher or 

1984
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:29,144
something and I said what she likes.
She said the self-loathing is like just 

1985
01:28:32,301 --> 01:28:34,130
off the charts.
She's not a bad person.

1986
01:28:34,131 --> 01:28:34,964
you feel kind of sorry for when you're 
in the green room with her because she 

1987
01:28:37,041 --> 01:28:38,680
does hates her.
And I,

1988
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:41,150
you know,
I'm ms dot cuLture is not here to defend

1989
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:41,984
herself.
But um,

1990
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,300
that's what I've heard,
that she's not a bad person.

1991
01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:45,770
She just,
uh,

1992
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,633
you know,
reads every tweet about herself and she 

1993
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,360
stays up at night with all of that.
I don't know,

1994
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:53,520
bill maher's friends with her,
which I've always found very odd,

1995
01:28:53,521 --> 01:28:57,870
like he talks about early as his friend 
and he has her on and they joke around,

1996
01:28:57,871 --> 01:28:59,610
they're jovIal together.
And I'm like,

1997
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,900
well,
what the fuck is going on?

1998
01:29:00,901 --> 01:29:02,040
they're well,
who is she?

1999
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,850
Is she that?
Is she this thing?

2000
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,240
She's a little bit of both.
Yeah.

2001
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,120
So a little bit of both.
Bit of an advocate.

2002
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,350
She knows that she says stuff that's 
over the top.

2003
01:29:10,351 --> 01:29:12,420
It helps her sell books and gets her 
anytime.

2004
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,240
Recent one with the trump book she wrote
me,

2005
01:29:15,241 --> 01:29:17,760
just the cover alone was like so 
bizarre,

2006
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:18,623
but it's there to piss you off or get 
you inspired and eventually you can go 

2007
01:29:22,441 --> 01:29:23,274
to some market and buy those books for 
$5 because honestly they don't sell and 

2008
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:30,373
not really.
That's why you can buy them for five 

2009
01:29:32,611 --> 01:29:33,840
bucks.
I have a few of her books.

2010
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:37,020
I bought them at places like costco with
a big sticker on them.

2011
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,510
I've read like a couple of her books.
They gO through fast.

2012
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:40,531
I read,
I read,

2013
01:29:40,531 --> 01:29:42,060
um,
the bushes,

2014
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:44,100
autobiography.
I got that at costco.

2015
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:47,590
She wrote a bush hog autobiography of 
George W.

2016
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:48,423
Bush.

2017
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:49,530
Yeah.
It was a krill,

2018
01:29:49,531 --> 01:29:51,620
a coloriNg book for adults.
There's no footnotes.

2019
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:52,463
There's no index,
but you kind of ended up liking him 

2020
01:29:53,911 --> 01:29:55,260
after the book is over.
But I.

2021
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:56,850
Yeah,
cause he just did.

2022
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,040
It doesn't seem like the worst guy,
but I,

2023
01:29:59,041 --> 01:30:00,790
I read um,
sarah pailin,

2024
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:02,460
his last book,
amerIca by heart.

2025
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:05,120
I got that crayon a no,
but it's like,

2026
01:30:05,121 --> 01:30:06,570
you know,
80 point type.

2027
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:09,090
It's like a,
it's like a 5,000

2028
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:12,450
word feature in a skinny book and it's,
it's funny.

2029
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,550
But I,
I read these books.

2030
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:16,800
I want to see sometimes where these 
people are coming from.

2031
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:20,850
Like there's that fellow,
that internet terrorist guy.

2032
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:24,300
I'm the guy with the long polysyllabic 
greek,

2033
01:30:24,301 --> 01:30:27,710
last name internet terrorist.
Papa,

2034
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:29,130
papa,
papa hippolytus.

2035
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:31,260
He has that book.
He's,

2036
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:34,890
he's on his spoken word tour right now.
The dangerous faggot tour.

2037
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:36,000
Oh,
milo.

2038
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,500
Milo yiannopoulos.
Yes.

2039
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,580
I've had them on a couple of times.

2040
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,550
He's interesting to me.
He's a fucking weirdo.

2041
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:43,170
Oh,
was a very interesting guy.

2042
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:47,250
He has incredibly smart in march and I 
wrote in the only weekly,

2043
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,290
two weeks ago I said,
I'm going to read his book.

2044
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:50,693
I want to read it.
I don't think I'm going to find 

2045
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:52,524
consensus,
but I'm honestly interested in finding 

2046
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:57,180
out where this guy gets off because he 
doesn't offend me.

2047
01:30:57,181 --> 01:30:59,460
I just kind of feel bad for them.
Why do you feel bad for them?

2048
01:30:59,461 --> 01:31:04,260
Just because It's a lot of ag rhoda,
to kinda drag around.

2049
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:06,390
I mean you have to kind of invent all of
that.

2050
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:08,540
She sat.
Just say it pal.

2051
01:31:08,550 --> 01:31:11,490
You're just manufacturing stuff.
That must be a real drag to.

2052
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,200
I would like to see the two of you guys 
talked together.

2053
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:15,660
I think that be kind of fascinating.
I actually enjoy milo.

2054
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:16,560
I enjoy his company.

2055
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,810
I enjoy talking to him.
He's not a bad guy,

2056
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:20,670
but a lot of the stuff he says is 
retarded,

2057
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,653
but I think he's.
But he's trying to get somebody to jump 

2058
01:31:23,071 --> 01:31:24,670
out of their seat for sure.
Yeah,

2059
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:27,840
and he has a book coming out called 
dangerous.

2060
01:31:27,841 --> 01:31:28,674
I think it's on amazon.
His whole thing is the dangerous faggot 

2061
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,810
tour.
That's,

2062
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,840
we can't have that on the cover of a 
book,

2063
01:31:33,841 --> 01:31:35,370
so it's just dangerous.
But,

2064
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:36,010
um,
I,

2065
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:40,290
I went to amazon and sho nuff it's 
coming out next march I believe.

2066
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:43,560
And so I'm going to read it.
I'd probabLy be a best seller.

2067
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:44,430
He's smart.
Yeah,

2068
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:45,090
I,
I,

2069
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:48,660
I know he's smart,
but I was just interested to see.

2070
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:49,341
I mean,
I,

2071
01:31:49,341 --> 01:31:50,174
I read,
uh,

2072
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:51,053
a big part of dick cheney's 
autobiography is fascinating because it 

2073
01:31:55,251 --> 01:31:56,940
in latin,
like ancient latin,

2074
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:57,841
but like,
you know,

2075
01:31:57,841 --> 01:31:59,040
the guys had 80 lights.

2076
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:01,570
I mean he's like served under like five 
presidents or something.

2077
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:03,520
I mean,
he's not a boring guy.

2078
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:04,930
It's been a very interesting life.
You know,

2079
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:05,770
nixon,
ford,

2080
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:09,100
reagan,
he's been in the oval office a lot.

2081
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:12,010
It's been in that building a lot.
He knows where all the bodies are buried

2082
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:16,270
and I don't want to live with these 
people,

2083
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:17,860
but as far as like seeing,
you know,

2084
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:19,450
reading what they have to say,
I'm,

2085
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:25,020
I'm curious in that way and that I want 
to know what's on someone's mind I might

2086
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:27,190
not agree with all the time.
Right.

2087
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,173
Well,
it's a good way to broaden your 

2088
01:32:28,991 --> 01:32:31,520
perspective,
get an idea of how they're actually.

2089
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:34,930
Yet everyone is essentially coming from 
the truth,

2090
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,700
their version of it.
That's acting class,

2091
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:37,534
right?
You got to be in that moment or 

2092
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:40,570
whatever.
And when I'd see these trump rallies,

2093
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,490
these people really do hate hillary 
clinton.

2094
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:46,420
They hate barack obama and they really 
do want to build that wall.

2095
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,553
It's all his real is me sitting here 
with you right now and I might not 

2096
01:32:50,621 --> 01:32:53,680
agree,
but you can't not say they're sincere.

2097
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:54,693
They're burning analog.
It is as real as anything you've ever 

2098
01:32:57,251 --> 01:33:00,520
felt as real.
I don't necessarily want to get into the

2099
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:03,670
inner mechanics of,
of that person because I kind of already

2100
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:04,504
know where it's coming from.
A lot of scene of phobia and half 

2101
01:33:06,341 --> 01:33:10,480
knowledge,
but you can't say that they're not legit

2102
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:15,700
and you just saw that they spoke quite 
loudly and Mr.

2103
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,533
Trump one,
well not the popular vote but the 

2104
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:19,354
electoral college certainly.
And so I want to know more about who I 

2105
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,570
share a country with.
I cAn't spend all day with it,

2106
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:30,160
but I do designate some bit of the day 
to try and figure this out.

2107
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,293
Otherwise,
how do you get up the road if you don't 

2108
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:32,680
know?

2109
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:35,380
Because I don't want my enemies in 
America.

2110
01:33:35,381 --> 01:33:38,500
I don't want to.
I don't want enemies in my own country.

2111
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,780
People that disagree with.
Yeah.

2112
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:44,680
But ultimately I want to get up the road
with them in order to do that.

2113
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,053
I can't be,
I don't want to get beat up by some guy 

2114
01:33:48,971 --> 01:33:49,804
getting out of his pickup truck to drill
some freedom Into my forehead with his 

2115
01:33:52,511 --> 01:33:53,710
fists because,
you know,

2116
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,860
I'm just not built for it.
And who is.

2117
01:33:57,430 --> 01:34:00,340
So I'm looking for a higher way to get 
up the road.

2118
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,320
I don't,
I'm not all that hopeful,

2119
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,520
uh,
but I,

2120
01:34:04,521 --> 01:34:08,360
I still try and dissect it that were 
forensically go through that,

2121
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,980
that american id because I travel 
through America.

2122
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:12,814
It's what I've been doing for 36 years.
I meet more americans than any 

2123
01:34:15,101 --> 01:34:16,900
president.
I hear the stories,

2124
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:18,580
like you hear the stories,
henry,

2125
01:34:18,581 --> 01:34:21,650
my friend died in Iraq and he loved you 
and I hear that story.

2126
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:22,483
It might.
My friend killed himself last month and 

2127
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:26,200
I'm really screwed up about it.
I want to tell you about it.

2128
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:30,250
So I hear I get a lot of input and it 
makes you like all these people,

2129
01:34:30,251 --> 01:34:34,000
like on the fat gay guy in Utah.
No one likes me and my parents kicked me

2130
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,670
out of the house when I was 18 because 
I'm cain and like,

2131
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:37,721
you,
you go,

2132
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:40,160
oh man.
You don't want to be that at anyone.

2133
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,013
When you hear stories like that,
all you want to do is like give them a 

2134
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:45,700
divo record and keep breathing.
Kid don't,

2135
01:34:45,701 --> 01:34:48,850
don't self harm.
And so the more stories I hear,

2136
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:53,950
it makes me want to be more decent to my
fellow americans understand us better.

2137
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:56,140
And that's one of the reasons I travel 
globally.

2138
01:34:56,200 --> 01:34:58,280
It's one of the reasons I do a lot of 
shows in America

2139
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:03,610
and I do a lot of listening and I think 
that's what we don't do anymore.

2140
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:06,800
We listed.
But when you logged on at patriot one 85

2141
01:35:06,801 --> 01:35:10,430
and you give some liberal snowflake,
whatever they call these people,

2142
01:35:10,590 --> 01:35:12,170
uh,
some grief on the internet,

2143
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,004
you're only listening to yourself.
You disliked disagreeing with people in 

2144
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,030
piling on.
It's very frat boy.

2145
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,073
Yeah.
Well you definitely can get it into an 

2146
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:22,100
echo chamber and lose perspective and 
you don't get out.

2147
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:22,851
Yeah.
Well,

2148
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:25,100
I think what you're saying is beautiful 
because I mean,

2149
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:25,934
it is a good idea to have an open mind 
and try to find out why these people 

2150
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:33,830
think in diametrically opposed ways to 
the way you think or what.

2151
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:35,990
Find out what,
what is the motivation,

2152
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:36,824
what was their background,
what would cause them to reach this 

2153
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:40,340
conclusion?
And ultImately,

2154
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:45,320
how can we get going because life is 
short and I want renewable energy and my

2155
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:45,620
time.

2156
01:35:45,620 --> 01:35:48,350
I don't want it to be feared.
I don't want solar panels to be,

2157
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:50,540
you know,
I'm sick of this.

2158
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:52,520
Who says so panels.
Just,

2159
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,100
you know what I mean?
Like that whole idea of like,

2160
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:55,934
oh,
what are you a science guy with your 

2161
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:57,081
pussy?
like,

2162
01:35:57,081 --> 01:35:57,914
yeah,
right.

2163
01:35:57,950 --> 01:35:59,270
Yeah.
That's what scientists are,

2164
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:00,710
you know,
that's one thing.

2165
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:04,790
Whenever you tweet something about 
global climate change,

2166
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,043
one of the first things that happens is 
these trump ets jump on board and they 

2167
01:36:10,911 --> 01:36:14,090
start attacking what you're saying.
And then tweeting,

2168
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:17,090
like,
I don't know if they've researched it or

2169
01:36:17,091 --> 01:36:17,924
not,
but it's just like immediate attitude 

2170
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:22,240
that the people on the right seemed to 
have where they had.

2171
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:26,780
They immediately want to dismiss 
anything that diminishes industry.

2172
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:31,781
Anything about climate change,
anything that protects the environment,

2173
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:35,180
whether it's about this dakota pipeline 
access thing,

2174
01:36:35,181 --> 01:36:36,290
that's just,
you know,

2175
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,000
the trump has just getting involved 
with.

2176
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,050
Yeah,
he green lIt it.

2177
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,030
I mean that's a,
that's intense.

2178
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,923
Oh,
you know what that was going on during 

2179
01:36:42,621 --> 01:36:43,454
the obama administration.
That's something that people need to 

2180
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:45,434
recognize that there's not a single 
fucking president that's really looking 

2181
01:36:47,421 --> 01:36:48,254
out for you and never has been won.
There's not one that you could really 

2182
01:36:50,391 --> 01:36:51,224
enjoy.
Every single one of them is doing some 

2183
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:54,800
creepy shit and that whole thing where 
they were.

2184
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:57,050
They were cutting easements through 
private land.

2185
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,810
They were arresting people on their own 
fucking land.

2186
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:02,300
They were saying that they had the right
to drill through their land.

2187
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:06,290
That was during the obama administration
started during his administration,

2188
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:09,350
supported by administration and they 
stopped at towards the end,

2189
01:37:09,710 --> 01:37:10,543
but it's almost like I kind of know that
they stopped it knowing that trump was 

2190
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:14,390
going to start it right the fuck back 
up.

2191
01:37:14,391 --> 01:37:17,840
As soon as he got in office,
I think the last few months of obama,

2192
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:21,490
that's why he kicked the russians out 
because you're like,

2193
01:37:21,650 --> 01:37:22,483
let trump bring them back and let let,
let me be the bad guy and get that 

2194
01:37:25,581 --> 01:37:29,420
headline and he'll green light that 
pipeline.

2195
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:33,590
I think obama had some fun on the waY 
out,

2196
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,020
knowing that trump is,
you know,

2197
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:35,873
first week is going to turn it all 
around and everyone gets to point the 

2198
01:37:38,421 --> 01:37:39,254
finger.
That's politics and that's why I don't 

2199
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:43,580
love any politician and I've never 
wanted to meet one.

2200
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:44,960
I,
I've,

2201
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,110
I wouldn't walk.
I come from Washington dc,

2202
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,460
you'd see them all the time,
you know,

2203
01:37:48,461 --> 01:37:50,570
they got to eat somewhere and I've 
never,

2204
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:53,690
I wouldn't walk five blocks to go meet 
one.

2205
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:56,040
I'd like to meet jimmy carter.
He's

2206
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,100
probably the only guy that I really 
wanted to see him speak just because,

2207
01:37:59,150 --> 01:38:01,200
you know,
I've never watched a president speak.

2208
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:02,790
I think it'd be interesting,
but I,

2209
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:08,750
I wouldn't mind meeting jimmy carter,
but I just kind of know they're all kind

2210
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:11,910
of cut from kind of the same bolt of 
cloth,

2211
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:15,600
just the different amounts of puke on 
the cloth.

2212
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,553
Right.
So like if it's raining outside and 

2213
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:19,260
they're outside,
they're wet.

2214
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:21,840
Yeah.
Because everyone's score.

2215
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:24,300
Vidal said by the time you get to the 
executive office,

2216
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,020
you've been bought and sold at least a 
dozen times willfully.

2217
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,860
How do you fix that?
By being a good person,

2218
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,600
because there's so much of it you can't 
fix,

2219
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:38,601
the only way to fix it is to go local 
and like when trump became president,

2220
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:43,330
I just did eight shows at largo in la 
and a lot of people were kind of failing

2221
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:44,933
and I said,
look,

2222
01:38:45,210 --> 01:38:46,043
when they start pushing against lgbt 
rights or women's reproductive health 

2223
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:53,790
rights or freedoms will neutralize 
benefits.

2224
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:54,570
We're going to,
you know,

2225
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:56,040
planned parenthood,
a clu,

2226
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:59,940
a southern poverty law center,
and the lgbt activist group.

2227
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:03,750
We can get involved and start kind of 
neutralizing this and slowing it down.

2228
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:05,410
And this is not a time to be dismayed.
This is,

2229
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,453
thIs is punk rock time.
This is what joe strummer trains you 

2230
01:39:07,951 --> 01:39:09,240
for.
It is now time to go.

2231
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:14,420
You're a good person means that means 
more now than ever because as a voter,

2232
01:39:14,701 --> 01:39:17,070
you know,
you throw your penny throat in the seat.

2233
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:18,600
That's all a vote is.
It's just like nothing.

2234
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,480
Like you don't even hear it fall,
but you can.

2235
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:22,343
You can be thunderous in your own life 
and being cool to the eight people 

2236
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:26,610
around you and that,
you know,

2237
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:28,620
it rubs off.
This is viral,

2238
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,830
it resonates it really.
And,

2239
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:33,720
and so I work locally,
right?

2240
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:35,970
As far as my eyes can see.

2241
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,620
I worked there,
there was an orphanage in,

2242
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:40,650
in los angeles I contributed money to 
for years.

2243
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,690
They've kind of morphed into something 
else now,

2244
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:46,200
but I work locally and if everyone did,
everyone worked like,

2245
01:39:46,201 --> 01:39:47,610
you know,
a yard in front of them.

2246
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:50,610
It started looking really good.
So you don't have to change the world.

2247
01:39:50,611 --> 01:39:53,820
You can just change your,
your street and changIng the world.

2248
01:39:54,030 --> 01:39:57,450
What a daunting task.
But it happens when enough people change

2249
01:39:57,451 --> 01:40:01,080
theIr street.
And so as a los angeles resident,

2250
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:05,190
I'd be happy to work inside the county 
of la doing good stuff.

2251
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:09,160
Whatever I can figure out to do,
you don't have to you because you,

2252
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,800
you're not going to push congress 
around.

2253
01:40:10,801 --> 01:40:13,230
THey seem to be loving to sit,
sit still.

2254
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,533
Uh,
so you can work locally and so going 

2255
01:40:17,011 --> 01:40:19,360
forward in this country,
it does.

2256
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,720
When it gets better is when the electric
gets better.

2257
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,553
As with jefferson taught you a vigorous,
educated electorate who votes and votes 

2258
01:40:25,831 --> 01:40:30,210
and votes to keep an american government
and democracy,

2259
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,240
a transparent lens as transparent as 
possible,

2260
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,270
and that's what you can do in this time 
like don't.

2261
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:38,520
You're not going to move to Canada like 
the canadians are going to have you,

2262
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:42,030
but you can be.
Your decency now means more.

2263
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:47,180
It's a it.
It's a more into a fruitful currency.

2264
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:50,010
It just means more now to help that guy 
out.

2265
01:40:50,011 --> 01:40:54,790
It's it's healthier help basically.
I feeling great things get done in times

2266
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:56,200
of conflict.
Absolutely.

2267
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,093
We have something to push back against.
People organized like that woman's 

2268
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:02,620
march.
You know exactly where you go,

2269
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:04,810
wow,
decency is under threat.

2270
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:06,093
I never thought about that.
Let's go and all of a sudden your life 

2271
01:41:08,411 --> 01:41:12,520
has some definition or like I like add 
the serial relationships.

2272
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:14,530
I'm not looking to get into an argument 
with you.

2273
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:18,100
I'm just saying like when I go on tour,
it's not me versus the audience.

2274
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:22,300
It's me versus the stress and the 
magnitude of the tour.

2275
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:26,340
I've bitten off for myself and I get the
fear of failing my audience.

2276
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:29,140
I love that and I battled that fear all 
day.

2277
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:29,974
Go to the gym becauSe you better put 
eIght miles on that treadmill because 

2278
01:41:32,201 --> 01:41:33,034
you got a show tonight.
There is a sort of damocles over your 

2279
01:41:34,961 --> 01:41:36,280
head.
Don't eat the pizza.

2280
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:38,110
Eat that because you've got a show 
tonight.

2281
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,003
Don't this up.
When you decided to do like eight miles 

2282
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:42,370
on a treadmill,
how do you feel like that benefits?

2283
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:46,300
You want to do a show mental toughness 
like I'm tired,

2284
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:47,134
I'm jet lagged and I'm going to be 
onstage and 40 minutes I'm so damn 

2285
01:41:49,631 --> 01:41:50,464
tired,
and then all that training comes in and 

2286
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,661
you're like,
man,

2287
01:41:52,661 --> 01:41:54,280
this can probably be the best show I've 
ever done.

2288
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,960
They start laughing like,
man,

2289
01:41:55,961 --> 01:41:57,610
I'm really tired.
ThIs is going to be awesome,

2290
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:00,520
and you go out there and crush it.
Now when you do your shows,

2291
01:42:00,580 --> 01:42:03,420
do you write it out in a long form?
No,

2292
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:04,254
but you know I've already written yes.
I've already written out in my journal 

2293
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:09,370
because those journals become books.
I tAke tons of write longhand type.

2294
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:12,030
Both on my leisure days I'd like to hand
write,

2295
01:42:12,031 --> 01:42:12,864
so I just like writing,
but mainly I don't have the time so I 

2296
01:42:14,681 --> 01:42:15,700
got to type it up.
Left.

2297
01:42:15,701 --> 01:42:16,810
He left.
He left headed.

2298
01:42:16,811 --> 01:42:17,800
Yeah.
So,

2299
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:18,813
and so I,
I've learned that you can't take too 

2300
01:42:21,701 --> 01:42:22,534
many notes.
YoU can't write enough like you have to 

2301
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:24,873
take add details of the last hour,
forget it the next day because you're 

2302
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:30,400
tired.
And so when I'm on stage I have no notes

2303
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,800
and it's all in the front of my brain 
pan.

2304
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,630
So if I'm going to quote the 
constitution or quota precedent or years

2305
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:40,480
that the supreme court did Whatever,
I just have to put it.

2306
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:43,510
I memorize all of it and I just carry it
around with me.

2307
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:46,810
And before I go on stage to center 
myself,

2308
01:42:46,811 --> 01:42:47,231
I,
I,

2309
01:42:47,231 --> 01:42:49,270
uh,
I quote lincoln from,

2310
01:42:49,271 --> 01:42:50,104
uh,
his speech for the speech to the 

2311
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:54,250
perpetuation of our governmental 
institutions.

2312
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,660
I think it's calleD,
is the,

2313
01:42:55,661 --> 01:42:58,390
the speeCh to the young men's lyceum.
It's been quoted.

2314
01:42:58,570 --> 01:43:00,520
Florida's first ever speeches.
He's really young.

2315
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,740
Eighteen,
38.

2316
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:05,310
I think it was in early january.
And it's,

2317
01:43:05,311 --> 01:43:06,144
I just quote parts of it to myself and 
kinda get ready to go out there and so 

2318
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:13,750
does that help you?
Just eliminates the rest of the day.

2319
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,390
So It's like all I have in my life as a 
show,

2320
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:21,630
I don't care about anything else.
My whole life is tonight and it's,

2321
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,500
it says I don't want anything else in 
the way.

2322
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,690
I think it was bjorn,
bjorn bork,

2323
01:43:25,691 --> 01:43:28,630
some elite tennis player.
He said,

2324
01:43:29,010 --> 01:43:30,910
I've read this in sports illustrated 
when I was a kid.

2325
01:43:30,911 --> 01:43:31,744
He said,
I just basically concentrate to 

2326
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,350
eliminate everything that's not the 
match.

2327
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,300
I was like,
that'll work.

2328
01:43:37,700 --> 01:43:39,160
Then I was hyperactive.
It didn't.

2329
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:42,130
It took me years to be able to really 
embrace that.

2330
01:43:42,430 --> 01:43:47,290
But when I go on stage after a show,
25 and 25 days,

2331
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:49,060
man,
the only thing getting you through it is

2332
01:43:49,061 --> 01:43:52,010
your love of being onstage.
My of the audIence.

2333
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:52,853
I love them.
Like just crazy obsessive and just the 

2334
01:43:57,051 --> 01:43:57,884
fact that I'm not thinking about how 
tired I am and how tired I'm going to 

2335
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:02,630
be.
I just all there is.

2336
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:08,050
They go and go and I walk out there and 
I've spent the last hour eliminating the

2337
01:44:09,141 --> 01:44:12,020
other parts of the day.
So do you have an outline of what you're

2338
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:13,400
going to talk about in my mind?

2339
01:44:13,400 --> 01:44:14,480
Yeah.
Only in your mind.

2340
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:15,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

2341
01:44:15,801 --> 01:44:16,634
Sometimes I'll at the beginning of a 
tour just to kind of get back in that 

2342
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:23,840
groove all I'll write a page of notes.
I'll talk about this into that,

2343
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:27,770
into that and I look at it and I kind of
walk it through in my mind and like,

2344
01:44:27,771 --> 01:44:28,604
okay,
you basically memorized all the 

2345
01:44:29,721 --> 01:44:32,200
furniture in the living room so you can 
run through it with your eyes closed and

2346
01:44:32,201 --> 01:44:36,840
not bump into anything.
And so when I go on stage one thing,

2347
01:44:36,841 --> 01:44:41,841
so tends to go into the next and I just,
all of a sudden I have a stopwatch.

2348
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:44,570
I bring it on stage and put it down for 
the audience's benefit,

2349
01:44:44,571 --> 01:44:46,250
not mine.
Because if I don't,

2350
01:44:46,251 --> 01:44:47,630
uh,
if I'm not careful,

2351
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,080
the shows we'll go well over two hours 
and I look down like,

2352
01:44:51,081 --> 01:44:52,490
oh no,
these poor people,

2353
01:44:52,491 --> 01:44:53,324
I got to certain landing this thing in 
any story takes you like 20 minutes to 

2354
01:44:56,181 --> 01:44:57,440
get it,
Intend to get out.

2355
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,273
So I'm like,
okay,

2356
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:01,250
we're taxiing.
I can see the runway and I'll let him go

2357
01:45:01,251 --> 01:45:02,084
in 15 minutes and I apologize I've kept 
you here for like two hours and 20 

2358
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:05,840
minutes.
I'm really sorry.

2359
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:07,820
I swear I'll be done with you and like 
10 more minutes,

2360
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:10,940
but I would imagine they'd want you to 
feel like no dude more.

2361
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:12,363
But uh,
I,

2362
01:45:12,570 --> 01:45:14,780
I,
I just don't want to keep them there for

2363
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:16,040
three hours.
I do,

2364
01:45:16,041 --> 01:45:18,160
but I can't write.
You don't want to abuse.

2365
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:20,850
Well,
it's want to leave them wanting more and

2366
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,290
just don't leave them going.
Like,

2367
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:25,220
that was really long.
I'm never coming back to this again.

2368
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:26,113
That was like having four molders being 
pulled because I always tell them I'm 

2369
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,180
desperate for your attention and your 
approval.

2370
01:45:32,181 --> 01:45:35,300
I really need you to keep showing up 
because without you on the tree,

2371
01:45:35,301 --> 01:45:36,920
that falls in the forest on witnessed.

2372
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:37,511
and uh,
if,

2373
01:45:37,511 --> 01:45:38,900
uh,
you're not here,

2374
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:39,681
man.
I got no,

2375
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:40,514
I got nothing going on now.
When you would do say if you do a 25 

2376
01:45:43,251 --> 01:45:45,330
show tour,
if you go out for $25,

2377
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:48,120
are you doing the exact same thing 
verbatim knowing?

2378
01:45:48,121 --> 01:45:48,471
No,
no,

2379
01:45:48,471 --> 01:45:48,831
no,
no,

2380
01:45:48,831 --> 01:45:49,664
no.
I'll have one or two big centerpiece 

2381
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:53,120
stories like on the last tour,
uh,

2382
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,103
many nights of the week I talked about 
the time I had lunch with david bowie 

2383
01:45:57,230 --> 01:45:59,930
because he had passed away last year and
he was really,

2384
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:00,823
really cool to me and it's a fun story 
and I told some lemmy stories because 

2385
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:05,810
let me from motorhead had died.
Uh,

2386
01:46:05,820 --> 01:46:08,360
in the weeks before the tour started.
I said,

2387
01:46:08,361 --> 01:46:08,691
well,
you know,

2388
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:09,524
lemmys gone and my fans are very big on 
lemmy and motorhead and I have a lot of 

2389
01:46:14,751 --> 01:46:15,584
stories.
I hung out with lemmy a lot and he's 

2390
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:19,580
just a wonderful guy,
really amazing guy.

2391
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:20,413
So I would tell some stories and those 
would kind of fall in and fall out and 

2392
01:46:23,991 --> 01:46:24,824
then things would happen in the world 
and that would come into the mix and I 

2393
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,440
sometimes if something is really 
relevant,

2394
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:35,390
I can connect it to something else.
Like almost any country that falls down,

2395
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,030
I've probably been there and I go,
well,

2396
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:41,030
okay,
here's what happened in Syria today.

2397
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:41,893
Now when I was there,
like in pull my afternoon and the l 

2398
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:47,200
hideous story out.
Uh,

2399
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:49,920
and so I have,
like I,

2400
01:46:50,670 --> 01:46:53,680
I was on route ru paul's a longtime 
palomar iso,

2401
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:54,900
one of my favorite humans.
Just,

2402
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,150
yeah,
just an amazing human being.

2403
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,770
Smart,
funny.

2404
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:02,970
And his had to run more than once 
because he's a big black guy in a wig.

2405
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:03,833
I mean someone wants to beat him up and 
he's just one of the more extraordinary 

2406
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:07,350
people I've ever met.

2407
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:09,090
And I met him at band practice in the 
nineties.

2408
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:12,240
He prActice down the hall from us and we
became pals.

2409
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:17,430
And so I talked about the time I was on 
rupaul's drag race is a judge,

2410
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:18,264
which was hilarious.
But I talKed about that story because I 

2411
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:22,740
was just on his show.
Ru paul,

2412
01:47:22,741 --> 01:47:23,574
dr three,
dr he puts a microphone on you in a 

2413
01:47:24,991 --> 01:47:25,824
gopro camera and he drives you around la
doing errands and he interviews you and 

2414
01:47:28,981 --> 01:47:29,814
he chops it up into content and so was 
able to tell my being a judge on 

2415
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:38,640
rupaul's drag race story because I could
segue into the day we ran errands,

2416
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,400
the normal places I go because I live 
alone.

2417
01:47:41,401 --> 01:47:42,234
I'm very much a solitary type.
I'd made this story about how I walked 

2418
01:47:45,511 --> 01:47:49,170
into all these places and the only time 
I've ever come in with someone else's.

2419
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:50,003
The one time I walked in with a six and 
a half foot tall black guy and everyone 

2420
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:55,860
who knows me and all these stores skills
like,

2421
01:47:55,890 --> 01:47:58,170
oh,
henry's finally found someone,

2422
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,243
and it was.
It was a story about perception because 

2423
01:48:01,741 --> 01:48:03,600
you'd see the looks on their face like,
oh,

2424
01:48:03,990 --> 01:48:06,150
hey henry.
Right.

2425
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:06,984
I always thought so.
it was hilarious and rupaul and I would 

2426
01:48:10,201 --> 01:48:13,350
leave these places would just laugh 
hysterically because they think we're an

2427
01:48:13,351 --> 01:48:14,184
item.
And we eventually had lunch in west la 

2428
01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:20,700
and we were recognized by everyone on 
the sidewalks immediately.

2429
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:23,070
People are taking photos.
And I said,

2430
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:25,610
ru paul,
I think we've become a power couple was.

2431
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:29,350
And this to me is an anecdote I would 
tell onstage.

2432
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,780
And it's funny,
but I'm not making up humor.

2433
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:34,614
I'm telling you,
uh,

2434
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,420
uh,
something that happened that was funny.

2435
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:37,440
That's how I get the humor.

2436
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,690
I basically stumbled into it like,
whoops,

2437
01:48:39,691 --> 01:48:44,270
I got humor on my shoe.
And it was funny because I got email,

2438
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:45,870
dude,
you're not going out with ru paul.

2439
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,880
And I would write back these really 
funny,

2440
01:48:47,881 --> 01:48:50,220
ambiguous email letters back.
I'm like,

2441
01:48:50,221 --> 01:48:51,054
well,
as a new couple we don't want external 

2442
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:58,050
factors to determine what this thing is 
going to be.

2443
01:48:58,051 --> 01:49:02,070
So right now we're just going with the 
flow and there's some kid in the midwest

2444
01:49:02,071 --> 01:49:05,220
who's head just exploded because I wrote
him back.

2445
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:06,083
Well,
you know,

2446
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:10,410
we're just checkIng it out,
let him post that wherever he wants.

2447
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,560
I don't give a damn.
And so that's what informs the shows.

2448
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:19,450
As the tour rolls out,
that story will be in the,

2449
01:49:19,451 --> 01:49:20,284
you know,
I'll do like 20 nights with that and 

2450
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:22,374
then it falls away and it comes back 
like three weeks later because I tour 

2451
01:49:26,161 --> 01:49:27,450
for months at a time.

2452
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:30,960
Like he does fiscal quarters go by and 
you don't have an opening act.

2453
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:33,150
You just go right on by herself.
I'm by myself.

2454
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:33,984
Yeah.
Sometimes like in Australia they have a 

2455
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:38,070
rule where if you know,
for people in your band,

2456
01:49:38,130 --> 01:49:41,190
your american band than you for 
australians have to play to.

2457
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:42,123
And I liked that.
And so a couple of times I've had a 

2458
01:49:44,011 --> 01:49:44,844
comedian,
really good guy he opens for on some of 

2459
01:49:48,131 --> 01:49:51,190
my bigger australian shows.
He didn't do it this last time,

2460
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:52,024
but he,
his name is bruce and he'll go do like 

2461
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:56,350
20 minutes so we can say we did that and
he's a great guy.

2462
01:49:56,351 --> 01:49:59,620
So when I was going to Australia and I 
bring american comedians to open for me,

2463
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:01,000
I don't,
I don't understand that well,

2464
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:03,580
they just have this one to one thing.
The canadians have it too,

2465
01:50:03,581 --> 01:50:06,070
like if you're going to play,
they want a local band playing too,

2466
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,530
so you'll use lever canadian opener,
but I,

2467
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:10,780
when I go to Canada too,
I bring american comedians,

2468
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:11,633
dope and I've done tours were that they 
didn't make me have an opener who is 

2469
01:50:15,611 --> 01:50:20,611
australian and I've done towards what 
they did was there last year in 2016,

2470
01:50:20,740 --> 01:50:23,200
like for a month of shows,
no opener.

2471
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,970
I thought it was going to be my buddy 
again.

2472
01:50:24,971 --> 01:50:26,170
And they said,
no,

2473
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:27,150
no one does this,
do I go,

2474
01:50:27,160 --> 01:50:30,280
how am I doing that?
But not last time it was explained to me

2475
01:50:30,281 --> 01:50:31,114
and I didn't care that much.
Like why don't they have that canadian 

2476
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:34,144
content rule?
and it comes to television right in 

2477
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:38,860
radio as well.
I think canadians,

2478
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:42,940
I think there's a certain amount of 
canadian content you have to have on the

2479
01:50:42,941 --> 01:50:46,960
radio and in television in Canada,
but usually I'm just on my own.

2480
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:48,390
Uh,
like the last one,

2481
01:50:48,391 --> 01:50:51,850
hundred and 56 shows.
There was no openers.

2482
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,650
Do you get lonely on the road?
Like,

2483
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:55,090
no,
I don't have that chip.

2484
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:58,120
I used to get really anyone else again?
I got lonelier.

2485
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:00,840
I got lonely when I was young,
you know,

2486
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:03,850
he had a girlfriend or something and now
I'm kinda like a,

2487
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:04,840
a lizard.

2488
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,073
He like,
you know,

2489
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:09,430
this lizard has had no one in a 
terrarium for 80 years.

2490
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:10,930
It's still keeps eating bugs.
Yeah.

2491
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,560
Like I'm Henry Rollins and I still keep 
eating books.

2492
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:16,210
I know I don't get lonely at all.
Wow.

2493
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:19,870
I just don't have the,
the iaf faulty wiring or something?

2494
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:21,550
No,
not at all.

2495
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:23,830
Depressed.
Super unusual.

2496
01:51:23,860 --> 01:51:24,671
Depressed?
Yes.

2497
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:25,810
Sure.
Depression,

2498
01:51:26,530 --> 01:51:27,363
feelings of blankness I have in combat,
but that's one of the reasons I go to 

2499
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:33,940
the gym that kind of blows that away.
Music helps but lonely.

2500
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:34,900
No.
Uh,

2501
01:51:35,110 --> 01:51:38,080
I missed people who are dead.
I missed ed people because he can't talk

2502
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:40,900
to him anymore.
like with my best friend's mom died.

2503
01:51:40,901 --> 01:51:44,800
I miss her A lot,
but I'm now.

2504
01:51:44,801 --> 01:51:49,030
Otherwise I see people when I see them.
You have to remember I'm basically,

2505
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:53,320
I'll be 56 in a couple of weeks.
I've been touring since I was 20.

2506
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:54,423
I've been playing the away game.
That's kind of what I know we're being 

2507
01:51:57,581 --> 01:52:00,340
off the road is difficult.
I live in a nice place.

2508
01:52:00,341 --> 01:52:01,930
It's cool.
A lot of records,

2509
01:52:01,931 --> 01:52:03,940
a nice stereo.
It's got all I need.

2510
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:06,730
Um,
but after three days home,

2511
01:52:06,731 --> 01:52:08,830
I'm bored.
I'm missing the tour bus.

2512
01:52:09,070 --> 01:52:10,690
I wish I was back on tour,
man.

2513
01:52:10,691 --> 01:52:13,870
There's a lot of people like that that 
have that wanderlust thing.

2514
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:14,733
Anthony bourdain has that same thing 
going on where he can't be home for a 

2515
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:18,490
couple of weeks.
She's home for a couple of weeks.

2516
01:52:18,491 --> 01:52:19,680
He's got to get the fuck away.
Yeah.

2517
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:23,830
I feel like I would like to leave.
I don't want to run out of this building

2518
01:52:23,831 --> 01:52:24,730
now,
but if someone said,

2519
01:52:24,731 --> 01:52:26,110
hey,
you want to go to Iceland tomorrow?

2520
01:52:26,111 --> 01:52:26,590
I'm like,
yeah,

2521
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:28,510
I can be packed and give me 20 minutes 
man.

2522
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:29,500
Just keep the car on.

2523
01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:30,880
I'll be right out.
Yeah.

2524
01:52:30,881 --> 01:52:31,714
And I'll go.
I'm hoping for some good location work 

2525
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:35,074
this year.
If they said you wanna go move to the 

2526
01:52:37,151 --> 01:52:39,100
czech republic for a year and a half and
make a,

2527
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:41,710
you know,
a two seasons of a tv show,

2528
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:43,900
I'd say yes.
Before I asked what the part was.

2529
01:52:44,020 --> 01:52:44,920
Really?
Yeah.

2530
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,213
You're going to get an offer now from 
the czech republic right now is banging 

2531
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:49,730
on his keyboard.
Well,

2532
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:51,650
you know what I mean.
There's like these gigs.

2533
01:52:51,651 --> 01:52:52,401
You get really like,
hey,

2534
01:52:52,401 --> 01:52:53,234
do you mind going to live in this part 
of the world for six weeks to make a 

2535
01:52:56,001 --> 01:52:56,834
movie?
I'm like,

2536
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:59,470
I'll be there in two days.
Oh yeah.

2537
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:01,580
No,
I run and stuff like that.

2538
01:53:01,581 --> 01:53:03,110
Man.
I'm just totally opposite.

2539
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:05,780
Everyone's different.
You have a family.

2540
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:10,020
Children wife will do that.
That's,

2541
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:11,460
that's,
that's your home you have.

2542
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:14,780
Even if I didn't,
I just never really before I had one.

2543
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,613
I just never really enjoyed being out 
that much of like going away and coming 

2544
01:53:19,551 --> 01:53:20,080
back.
Yeah.

2545
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,430
I get you and I like being home for long
stretches.

2546
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:25,140
I feel more productive at home.
Huh?

2547
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,333
Yeah.
For me,

2548
01:53:26,510 --> 01:53:28,460
all the good wrIting,
the good thinking,

2549
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:31,220
the good workouts.
It all comes from being on the road.

2550
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,430
I just burned cleaner.
My mood elevates.

2551
01:53:34,710 --> 01:53:37,730
Let him off the road.
I everyday I wake up in my own bed,

2552
01:53:37,731 --> 01:53:42,731
I feel I'm kind of failing and I'm 
wimping out really home,

2553
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:45,340
you're failing and wimping out at home.
Why?

2554
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:46,400
And that?
You know what?

2555
01:53:46,401 --> 01:53:48,680
I put that on me.
I'm not saying anyone else's.

2556
01:53:48,770 --> 01:53:51,440
I wouldn't do,
I don't get to tell people what to do,

2557
01:53:51,441 --> 01:53:55,160
but for me everyday I'm not out in the 
world.

2558
01:53:55,230 --> 01:53:56,063
I'm like thinking I'm trying to dodge 
the ball instead of like deflecting it 

2559
01:53:58,821 --> 01:54:00,260
or catching it or getting hit by it.

2560
01:54:00,650 --> 01:54:02,660
Yeah.
I'd rather be out like,

2561
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,013
oh my,
the people I traveled with my road 

2562
01:54:05,781 --> 01:54:06,614
manager and our merchant guy,
we'd been travelIng the world together 

2563
01:54:08,511 --> 01:54:12,500
for about a decade and we all like,
wow,

2564
01:54:12,530 --> 01:54:14,630
we're,
we're off this bus in two days.

2565
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:18,350
I guess I'll start packing.
None of us want to go.

2566
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,750
Wow.
My road manager,

2567
01:54:20,751 --> 01:54:21,584
he has a family,
so he's looking forward to being back 

2568
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:24,650
with them of course.
But me and the merge guy,

2569
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:25,251
man,
we're just,

2570
01:54:25,251 --> 01:54:27,310
you know,
to solo acts,

2571
01:54:27,311 --> 01:54:31,940
swinging from vine to vine.
And so this year I don't have any.

2572
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:32,933
I got like a few talking shows.
I'm going to key note this cannabis 

2573
01:54:34,941 --> 01:54:36,710
thing and a couple of weeks in san 
francisco.

2574
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:37,990
What is the,
what is it?

2575
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:38,833
It's a thing of for cannabis 
entrepreneurs and since I don't smoke 

2576
01:54:42,171 --> 01:54:43,004
marijuana or any cannabis product,
but I'm pro legalization and 

2577
01:54:46,041 --> 01:54:49,520
decriminalization,
they want me to speak on that and I said

2578
01:54:49,670 --> 01:54:50,503
I'm in and so I've got a couple of gigs 
but beyond that I've got nothing going 

2579
01:54:53,661 --> 01:54:54,494
on this year so I'm waiting for an 
audition or a meeting and someone gives 

2580
01:54:57,471 --> 01:54:58,304
me a gig and if I don't get any of that 
then I'm just going to pack my bags and 

2581
01:55:01,281 --> 01:55:04,310
find some jungle in some desert and go 
dig it.

2582
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:07,610
Now when you're writing something about 
cannabis and you don't use it,

2583
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,930
I mean you obviously had a long history 
with drugs before you got clean me?

2584
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:13,400
Yeah.
Oh no sir.

2585
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,740
never know.
I got drunk like four times in my life.

2586
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:17,660
I smoked marijuana once,
7:11

2587
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:21,320
hamilton street in trenton.
New jersey is after band.

2588
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:24,470
Practice was really boring and my 
bandmates were smoking a joint.

2589
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:25,400
I said,
can I try that?

2590
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:26,830
And they said,
you one,

2591
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:28,130
I'm so bored.
I'll try it.

2592
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:30,030
I haTed it.
So he never,

2593
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:30,873
he never really had that time in your 
life where you're not fucking around 

2594
01:55:33,111 --> 01:55:34,310
with drugs.
I did.

2595
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,573
I think I tried weed once.
I had a few experiences with michelob 

2596
01:55:38,911 --> 01:55:40,760
and 10th grade.
I just didn't like it.

2597
01:55:41,750 --> 01:55:44,160
I tried lsd a handful of times.
Interesting.

2598
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:44,994
But easy to lose your mind.
Tried mushrooms a few times and when I 

2599
01:55:48,871 --> 01:55:52,650
did that thing at the strip bar with the
red show,

2600
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:55,380
it was drug stories and they said,
do you have when I go,

2601
01:55:55,381 --> 01:55:56,214
yeah,
I'll talk about the time of me and this 

2602
01:55:57,211 --> 01:56:00,540
girl were on acid driving her car and 
damn near got killed.

2603
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:01,780
And so,
you know,

2604
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:03,240
she was crazy.
She's dead now.

2605
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:04,463
But um,
I told that story about being on acid 

2606
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:07,764
and latina.
That's probably where I got it froM 

2607
01:56:08,690 --> 01:56:10,020
then.
Oh yeah.

2608
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:14,010
Other stories of my,
like six acid trips.

2609
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:15,053
So when,
when did you just decide to go 

2610
01:56:16,201 --> 01:56:17,950
completely clean?
Well,

2611
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:21,360
I never really got started in my career 
as a drug addict.

2612
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:23,820
I mean,
noT even an avenue saying addict.

2613
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:25,770
I'm saying someone uses it.
Oh no,

2614
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:26,790
no,
it never.

2615
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:27,623
I,
I'm wired to such a in such a way that 

2616
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:35,330
any stimulant is kind of a depressant,
like beer and the times I drank,

2617
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,081
I just,
you know,

2618
01:56:37,081 --> 01:56:39,300
for beers I'd throw up on my shoes.
I wasn't good at it,

2619
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:40,493
I didn't enjoy it.
I just did it because I wanted to hang 

2620
01:56:41,761 --> 01:56:43,280
out with the gang,
like my,

2621
01:56:43,300 --> 01:56:46,230
my dumb ass friends at school and I 
didn't like it.

2622
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:47,063
It just,
I didn't like the dizziness and it 

2623
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,450
didn't make me happy.
It just made me stupid.

2624
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:52,823
That time I smoked marijuana.
I just sat there waiting for it to be 

2625
01:56:54,901 --> 01:56:55,734
over.
I sat trying to figure out how to pick 

2626
01:56:57,691 --> 01:56:59,430
up a glass of water is sitting on.
I'm like,

2627
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,160
how do I do that?
And all my,

2628
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,410
my bandmates are experienced stones and 
they're like,

2629
01:57:04,830 --> 01:57:06,360
you do that henry?
I'm like,

2630
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:07,583
thank you.
So you couldn't understand picking up a 

2631
01:57:09,271 --> 01:57:11,460
glass of water when you went too deep.
Like I said,

2632
01:57:11,461 --> 01:57:13,410
how,
how long does this last for?

2633
01:57:13,411 --> 01:57:14,161
They said,
about 20,

2634
01:57:14,161 --> 01:57:15,090
30 minutes.
I said,

2635
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:15,924
okay,
and I just sat and stared at my watch 

2636
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:19,080
and waited it out.
Acid was interesting.

2637
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:21,030
Were you like,
wow,

2638
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:21,864
I could lose my mind so I just better 
like concentrate so it doesn't run out 

2639
01:57:24,511 --> 01:57:26,550
of my skull.
Mushrooms are fun.

2640
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,480
You laugh your ass off for three hours 
and that wasn't so bad,

2641
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:33,060
but I just didn't see anything to 
pursue.

2642
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,580
I tried it.
It was the same thing every time.

2643
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,710
and that's kind of my entire history 
with drug use.

2644
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:42,600
That was it.
Like caffeine,

2645
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:43,620
right?
Well yeah,

2646
01:57:43,621 --> 01:57:48,330
but this I would drink like I'm,
that's a small cup of coffee.

2647
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,550
This will last me,
believe it or not,

2648
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:53,670
all day and one cup.
I drink a cup of day,

2649
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:55,680
I make a cup of coffee and I just sip 
it.

2650
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:56,813
So what I'm thinking is that I'm 
medicating with caffeine like an 

2651
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:00,204
antidepressant and I use it as an iv 
drip because I never drink cups of 

2652
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:07,860
coffee to start off hot and by the end 
of the day it's just this cold.

2653
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:08,723
Yeah.
But I sip it and I think it's just a 

2654
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:14,430
drip,
ivy of caffeine and it must be because I

2655
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:17,490
always have a cup of coffee with me and 
it's always half full,

2656
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:18,900
like on the weekends.

2657
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,513
On the weekends if I'm off the road I go
to coffee places to sit and write for 

2658
01:58:23,431 --> 01:58:24,264
hours and work on book manuscripts and 
I'll buy the small coffee like this one 

2659
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:32,610
and three and a half hours later I'll 
leave and I'll just drop it in the trash

2660
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,230
because it's still about three quarters 
full.

2661
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:37,240
So I don't drink a lot of coffee in the 
wintertime.

2662
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:40,140
I'll drink a cup of tea in the morning 
and have a cup,

2663
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:42,910
a part of a cup of coffee.
I'll drink all of the tea.

2664
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:44,430
What,
what makes what?

2665
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:47,140
What fuels you to be so prolific?
You know you,

2666
01:58:47,141 --> 01:58:50,050
you're saying you write an article a 
month for the la weekly,

2667
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:52,810
so once a week.
A thousand words a week?

2668
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,070
Yeah.
Which is not do that.

2669
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:57,370
You write for rolling stone Australia 
once a month and then I write,

2670
01:58:57,430 --> 01:58:58,263
I try and write a thousand words a day 
for myself and I have right now five 

2671
01:59:02,831 --> 01:59:06,400
different books in various states of 
completion of some college guy saying my

2672
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:10,420
manuscript,
these are done and I'm by day I edit,

2673
01:59:11,110 --> 01:59:11,943
I'm editing the next journal book travel
book and then at night I'm writing 

2674
01:59:16,780 --> 01:59:19,960
another journal book and working on one 
of two different music books.

2675
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:23,080
I do a series of music books called 
fanaTic where I,

2676
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:23,973
you know,
rare records and labels like music geek 

2677
01:59:26,021 --> 01:59:28,510
stuff.
And so I work on those at night.

2678
01:59:28,660 --> 01:59:32,080
And you also host a radio show and I 
have the weekly radio show I just filled

2679
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:32,471
in.
Oh,

2680
01:59:32,471 --> 01:59:34,510
tomorrow in england.
And bbc radio six.

2681
01:59:34,511 --> 01:59:37,660
I'm filling in for iggy pop.
He took a vacation from his show.

2682
01:59:37,870 --> 01:59:40,840
So I filled in for him last week and 
this week as well.

2683
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,880
So I did those shows.
So I'm,

2684
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:44,930
I'm always busy.
Um,

2685
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:50,160
and so stimulants would get in my way.
What powers me.

2686
01:59:50,561 --> 01:59:52,930
it's not money,
it's not ambition,

2687
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,770
it's anger.
I'm one of those people.

2688
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:58,150
I,
I wish there was a better way to say it,

2689
01:59:58,151 --> 02:00:00,400
but it's,
it's vengeance.

2690
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:02,350
He laughed at me in high school,
man.

2691
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:05,230
He said I wasn't going to be anything 
really.

2692
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:09,490
Like watch this,
like that's still pushing your 56.

2693
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:11,220
I hate to say it.
Oh yeah,

2694
02:00:11,290 --> 02:00:12,730
40,
40 years later.

2695
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:13,600
Oh yeah.
All of it.

2696
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:15,770
Like my dad,
you know,

2697
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:17,530
he was a big money guy.
I'm like,

2698
02:00:17,531 --> 02:00:19,330
okay,
you love money so much.

2699
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:24,100
Watch me outgrows you and your whole 
damn family two combined and I don't,

2700
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:28,510
I don't even care about.
I just like achieving it and it's one of

2701
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:30,310
the reasons when the agent goes,
okay,

2702
02:00:30,311 --> 02:00:31,840
five shows on one off.
I'm like,

2703
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:32,674
oh no,
no man,

2704
02:00:33,180 --> 02:00:33,621
no,
no,

2705
02:00:33,621 --> 02:00:35,470
that's a day off.
You put a show in there.

2706
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,360
Like why?
Because like,

2707
02:00:37,450 --> 02:00:40,690
screw that man,
watch me put two shows on that night.

2708
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:42,010
What you think?
I cAn't.

2709
02:00:42,050 --> 02:00:43,600
I'm just,
like I said,

2710
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:46,990
I set up adversarial relationships.
I'm not against you or anything.

2711
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:50,500
I'm just saying like I have to have 
something to push against,

2712
02:00:50,501 --> 02:00:52,990
like a schedule that is like the 
schedules,

2713
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:56,670
like godzilla,
like you can't finish this all like,

2714
02:00:56,680 --> 02:00:57,513
really man,
I'm going to serve you up and eat you 

2715
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:00,123
everyday like a steak and I just have to
have that and so I'm getting back and 

2716
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:05,470
it's a.

2717
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:07,300
I think of all the people I was in bands
with,

2718
02:01:07,301 --> 02:01:10,360
I have to crush them.
Everyone grew up with.

2719
02:01:10,510 --> 02:01:14,980
I have to powderize them.
Why that's such a weird motivation is it

2720
02:01:14,981 --> 02:01:16,000
sucks.
It's immature.

2721
02:01:16,001 --> 02:01:18,490
It's like it's 11 year old sandbox.
Wow.

2722
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:20,500
You're aware of it.
Yeah.

2723
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:21,353
That which makes it even stranger 
because it's not something that you're 

2724
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:24,730
just operating under.
Well,

2725
02:01:24,731 --> 02:01:25,241
you know,
you have,

2726
02:01:25,241 --> 02:01:26,074
it's,
it's controlling you and you don't 

2727
02:01:27,281 --> 02:01:31,030
understand why I quite enjoy it.
Yeah.

2728
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:31,961
Like if I,
you know,

2729
02:01:31,961 --> 02:01:32,440
I,
I,

2730
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,273
I'm not an actor but I go up for acting 
parts on bike basically going in there 

2731
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:38,000
and winging it and I get,
you know,

2732
02:01:38,120 --> 02:01:42,020
I get to go up for like really big parse
this a little bit of trepidation knowing

2733
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:43,480
I'm going in there,
but then I'm thinking like,

2734
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:45,620
oh yeah,
sony,

2735
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:46,523
whatever,
man,

2736
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:49,720
line it up and I almost like run out of 
my car.

2737
02:01:49,750 --> 02:01:50,000
Like,
yo,

2738
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,770
where you at man?
And I'm not trying to impress you.

2739
02:01:52,771 --> 02:01:55,130
I'm a tough guy so I'm not,
I just need,

2740
02:01:55,160 --> 02:01:55,993
it just needs to be trying to tell me I 
can't and I that informs everything I 

2741
02:02:02,721 --> 02:02:03,554
do.
Like instead of just dialing my radio 

2742
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:07,250
show in,
I will work on that sucker for like five

2743
02:02:07,251 --> 02:02:09,410
hours.
It has to be all handpicked.

2744
02:02:09,411 --> 02:02:10,550
Know that song,
not that one.

2745
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,800
This one and I make like three drafts of
it.

2746
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:13,634
It's intense.
It's one of the reasons why I live 

2747
02:02:14,811 --> 02:02:17,420
alone.
It's like I work all the time like,

2748
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,920
hey,
come out on this weekend,

2749
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:20,360
now it's 7:00
PM on a friday.

2750
02:02:20,361 --> 02:02:24,170
I'm working like I'm not a constant.
Yeah,

2751
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,180
nah,
I'm not fun to hang out with.

2752
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:28,340
Do you vacation ever where you just 
chill?

2753
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:31,220
I can't intellectually and 
existentially.

2754
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:33,710
I can't understand the idea of a 
vacation.

2755
02:02:34,260 --> 02:02:35,093
I make a joke on stage and saId I want 
to come back 10 pounds lighter with an 

2756
02:02:37,431 --> 02:02:38,390
internal parasite.

2757
02:02:38,650 --> 02:02:39,483
I,
I want to come back with like a scar 

2758
02:02:41,301 --> 02:02:42,134
where the spear kind of grazed me an 
eight grade stories and a dangerous 

2759
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:46,484
insect in my bag.
I don't want to sit on the beach and 

2760
02:02:48,981 --> 02:02:52,340
soak in the race.
I want to get sunburned by,

2761
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:54,410
you know,
being in the desert and,

2762
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:55,363
you know,
figuring out how the sun won't try and 

2763
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:59,150
kill me by noon.
That's the sahara.

2764
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:00,463
And so that's how I go about it.
So part of your motivation is actually 

2765
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:07,190
the perception by other people,
what you're doing,

2766
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,353
like understanding that what you're 
doing is so undeniable the volume that 

2767
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:13,820
you're putting out and the intensity,
the intensity.

2768
02:03:13,821 --> 02:03:16,610
So undeniable.
Like I'll show you motherfuckers.

2769
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:17,444
Yeah,
absolutely.

2770
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:18,650
Wow.
That's so weird.

2771
02:03:18,680 --> 02:03:20,180
Even with people who like me,
like,

2772
02:03:20,181 --> 02:03:21,200
yay henry's here.
I'm like,

2773
02:03:21,201 --> 02:03:21,920
yeah,
I'm here.

2774
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:22,760
Check it out.
Pitch.

2775
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:27,880
So here's a place you won't go and not 
that I have any aggression towards these

2776
02:03:28,911 --> 02:03:29,840
people,
I just,

2777
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:33,500
I just want to burn brightly and it's 
not about money.

2778
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,500
It's not about,
I'm better than you because I,

2779
02:03:36,501 --> 02:03:37,334
I don't think I'm better than anybody.
I just want to explode as much as 

2780
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:44,030
possible.
And I think to my audience,

2781
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:45,890
it's to their benefit.
He's like,

2782
02:03:45,891 --> 02:03:48,170
that dude's going to go out there to a 
place I don't want to go.

2783
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,004
It is going to come back with 10 great 
photos and a story about how he nearly 

2784
02:03:51,411 --> 02:03:52,940
lost his foot.
It's great.

2785
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:56,060
And like put me in coach.
That's the game I want to play.

2786
02:03:56,090 --> 02:03:59,030
That's what I go for.
And I'm not trying to.

2787
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:02,090
I'm just trying to like,
like in the high school I was like,

2788
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:05,210
you know,
the wise ass kid who had awful grades on

2789
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:06,290
ritalin.
I was a mess.

2790
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:09,410
And so ritalin and high school who I was
on ritalin since like,

2791
02:04:09,440 --> 02:04:11,270
uh,
like right at a preschool.

2792
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:14,000
Oh shIt.
Look at the early.

2793
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:16,820
A government documentation on,
on ritalin.

2794
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:18,050
This is not a joke.
Oh,

2795
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,790
there's these big books.
My mom had them,

2796
02:04:19,791 --> 02:04:21,980
there's photos of me.
They tried ritalin out.

2797
02:04:21,981 --> 02:04:26,720
I was part of the test group and we 
would get little orange tablets and then

2798
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:30,980
we get little yellow tablets and we have
triangular orange tablets for awhile and

2799
02:04:30,981 --> 02:04:31,814
my.
I went to a place called the national 

2800
02:04:32,991 --> 02:04:36,740
research center and I was a hyperactive 
kid and they said,

2801
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:38,520
here,
we're trying this stuff out.

2802
02:04:38,521 --> 02:04:43,521
my mom had me on ritalin from preschool 
all the way to twelfth grade.

2803
02:04:44,850 --> 02:04:46,770
Holy shit.
In the summertime,

2804
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:48,840
summer vacation,
I wouldn't take it,

2805
02:04:49,290 --> 02:04:52,020
and within a day of this of kick and his
self out of your system,

2806
02:04:52,021 --> 02:04:56,250
man,
your appetite comes back and in ninth or

2807
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:57,084
10th grade I started weightlifting and I
started like throwing the pills out 

2808
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:01,073
because it's.
It's an app at that speed and so it 

2809
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:07,110
suppresses your appetite and so I'm 
going through puberty.

2810
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:11,550
My hormones are raging and I stopped 
using the tablet and all of a sudden I'm

2811
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:12,810
that guy at lunch.
We're like the,

2812
02:05:12,811 --> 02:05:13,200
the,
the,

2813
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:16,290
the line of milk on the outer edge of 
the tray because I'm eating like,

2814
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:18,420
you know,
tons of food in the locust.

2815
02:05:18,460 --> 02:05:19,293
Phil,
I'm going to the gym And I'm just 

2816
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,933
getting really,
my frustration is now being informed by 

2817
02:05:24,721 --> 02:05:27,810
a physicality that I'm getting by 
lifting weights,

2818
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:28,823
so all of a sudden I'm putting muscle on
and I'm angry at the world and I'm a 

2819
02:05:34,231 --> 02:05:35,064
spazz and so by twelfth grade I was kind
of a maniac and then I got into punk 

2820
02:05:40,231 --> 02:05:42,150
rock and you know,
just got,

2821
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:43,043
got into that slug fest and just kind of
went into the world just kind of wildly 

2822
02:05:46,891 --> 02:05:48,240
swinging away.
Who the,

2823
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:49,163
why did they put you on ritalin at such 
a young age because it's what they were 

2824
02:05:51,511 --> 02:05:55,170
doing in America with a lot of young 
people who talk too much or you know,

2825
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:56,183
had that socIal skills well on energy,
at attention deficit and I couldn't 

2826
02:05:59,971 --> 02:06:03,630
concentrate and I got thrown out of the 
dc public school system,

2827
02:06:03,940 --> 02:06:04,950
uh,
for being,

2828
02:06:04,951 --> 02:06:06,360
you know,
he's yelling,

2829
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:07,260
he's doing this.

2830
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:08,093
And I actually read a couple of teachers
reports about me years later and I said 

2831
02:06:11,101 --> 02:06:12,270
I had no memory.
I said,

2832
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:13,980
I did all that.
My mom went,

2833
02:06:13,981 --> 02:06:14,814
yeah,
that's why they kicked you out and they 

2834
02:06:15,781 --> 02:06:18,240
kicked you out of school?
Yeah.

2835
02:06:18,330 --> 02:06:19,163
And uh,
I got kicked out of a few schools until 

2836
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:22,043
they put me in a,
in a prep school where the advertising 

2837
02:06:25,441 --> 02:06:25,921
is like,
oh,

2838
02:06:25,921 --> 02:06:29,250
your kid has problems with studying,
will cool them out.

2839
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:31,890
And I,
the first few days of school,

2840
02:06:31,891 --> 02:06:32,724
some kids spoke at a class and I watched
this one teacher picked this kid up and 

2841
02:06:35,371 --> 02:06:36,810
just kind of toss them into a 
blackboard.

2842
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:39,210
I went right in his class.
You shut up.

2843
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,490
And so I,
I didn't want to get,

2844
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:43,650
you know,
a thrashing by a teacher,

2845
02:06:43,651 --> 02:06:44,484
so I was always really careful.
But having that difficulty sitting down 

2846
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:52,400
and I was fine with topics I liked.
I didn't know,

2847
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:53,243
I didn't groove on math or any of that,
but at lunchtime I'd go to the library 

2848
02:06:56,821 --> 02:06:57,654
and start memorizing the latin 
nomenclature of every north american 

2849
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:02,190
snake.
I had to learn them all.

2850
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:05,550
And by like 10th grade I had,
and I have,

2851
02:07:05,551 --> 02:07:07,960
most of it's still in my head,
but I'm always,

2852
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:08,010
always

2853
02:07:08,010 --> 02:07:10,290
very confused at these medical 
distinctions.

2854
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:15,320
Whether it's adhd or hyperactive or add 
whatever the fuck it is.

2855
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,043
Is is that real or do people just do.
Some people just have a different 

2856
02:07:20,701 --> 02:07:21,534
composition,
a different passion inside of them and 

2857
02:07:23,791 --> 02:07:24,624
they resist doing things they don't want
to do and they don't want to be a part 

2858
02:07:28,381 --> 02:07:31,350
of any structured school curriculum.
I think all of it.

2859
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:31,921
But it.
Yeah.

2860
02:07:31,921 --> 02:07:35,190
And is that a disease or is that or do 
you just have more fucking.

2861
02:07:35,191 --> 02:07:36,010
They're looking right now.
If

2862
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:37,840
you have any pills,
you're not on anything.

2863
02:07:38,030 --> 02:07:38,501
And yet.
Yeah.

2864
02:07:38,501 --> 02:07:40,000
Well his passion for life.
You have all this.

2865
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:42,940
Isn't that the same shit that you had 
when you were six?

2866
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,550
Just was undisciplined and unfocused.
Right?

2867
02:07:45,551 --> 02:07:47,020
But that doesn't,
that's not a disease,

2868
02:07:47,021 --> 02:07:47,561
right?
I,

2869
02:07:47,561 --> 02:07:48,394
I dunno,
I mean I wouldn't call it a disease I 

2870
02:07:49,331 --> 02:07:50,770
think is this wiring.
Right,

2871
02:07:50,771 --> 02:07:53,230
but why the fuck is it named?
Why is it adh?

2872
02:07:53,231 --> 02:07:55,090
So they can.
So they can sell you a pill.

2873
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:56,073
I know,
but isn't that crazy when you look back 

2874
02:07:57,551 --> 02:07:59,980
at your own life,
the fact that you were on that shit for.

2875
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:01,510
I mean what,
how many.

2876
02:08:01,720 --> 02:08:03,640
A lot of years,
eight years,

2877
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:04,474
nine years.
It really screws with you because you 

2878
02:08:05,861 --> 02:08:07,290
can feel it.
When you take the t,

2879
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,710
the pill,
you can.

2880
02:08:09,370 --> 02:08:13,190
You're basically,
you're a propeller that spins so fast.

2881
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:15,440
It looks like they're like spokes of a 
wheel wheel.

2882
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:17,800
We'll still,
but it's actually going really fast.

2883
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:23,070
That's how it felt like on the outside 
I'm like this pale skinny like eh,

2884
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:24,933
but inside I'm like the last few minutes
of a dave in 2001 was coming into the 

2885
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:33,010
space time continuum and everything is 
flying by.

2886
02:08:33,011 --> 02:08:34,310
that was lIke 10th grade for me.
Right.

2887
02:08:34,311 --> 02:08:35,144
It's kind of held onto my desk and 
fairly flew through classes like not 

2888
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:46,230
being able to retain much because I was 
speeding my brains out and then the pill

2889
02:08:46,391 --> 02:08:47,224
would wear off around dinner and all of 
a sudden you're like eating two meals 

2890
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:54,250
and the next morning you take the pill 
and you don't eat again for hours.

2891
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:55,293
That is fucking crazy.
It was nuts and scares the shit out of 

2892
02:08:58,901 --> 02:09:01,630
me too because my parents didn't put me 
on anything like that,

2893
02:09:01,631 --> 02:09:05,350
but I know I would've.
I know I would've been diagnosed.

2894
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:07,720
I know I would have been put on 
something if I had the wrong parents.

2895
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,260
Yeah,
they put me on my.

2896
02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:13,180
My mom put me on this stuff probably 
because my doctor said,

2897
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:14,140
you know,
hey iris,

2898
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:15,453
this helps a lot of kids,
but I was in these classes and I'll 

2899
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:21,970
never forget one day I'm going through 
my mom's books.

2900
02:09:21,971 --> 02:09:24,370
There's just thIs big honking hardcover 
book.

2901
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:28,660
And I opened it up and I saw these,
like a contact sheet of me.

2902
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:29,800
I'm like,
wait a minute.

2903
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:30,963
That set place.
And then I saw the camera angle and I 

2904
02:09:33,821 --> 02:09:37,510
realized there were these mirrors on the
wall,

2905
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:41,050
their observation rooms.
I'll never forget one day I'm looking at

2906
02:09:41,051 --> 02:09:41,884
that mirror and a door opened from the 
side and my mom walked out and they 

2907
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:46,264
would,
we were being observed and the camera 

2908
02:09:48,011 --> 02:09:48,844
angle was from that observation room and
there's me playing with blocks and 

2909
02:09:54,671 --> 02:09:55,240
stuff.
I'm like,

2910
02:09:55,240 --> 02:09:57,520
I remember that sweater.
Oh man,

2911
02:09:57,521 --> 02:09:58,390
I'm like four.

2912
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:00,970
And that was part of that research 
group.

2913
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:01,833
Wow.
And maybe because my mom was a 

2914
02:10:02,831 --> 02:10:04,540
government employee,
I don't know,

2915
02:10:04,900 --> 02:10:05,733
but I was uh,
I went to a place called it for two 

2916
02:10:07,631 --> 02:10:09,160
years,
called the national research center.

2917
02:10:09,161 --> 02:10:12,310
I got thrown out of their wow for 
wounding a kid,

2918
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:14,920
which due to them through a bunch of 
powdered.

2919
02:10:14,921 --> 02:10:17,440
Submitted his face.
Yeah.

2920
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:18,993
Now when you started lifting weights 
when you were in twelfth grade and you 

2921
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,370
want more like a ninth or 10th?
Ninth and 10th.

2922
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,233
Yeah.
Early to when you stopped taking the 

2923
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:27,124
pills,
did you feel like the exercise did for 

2924
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:32,470
you what the pills were kind of supposed
to do for you?

2925
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,480
The weightlifting,
you know,

2926
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:36,740
I had a,
this coach,

2927
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:37,703
when he's mentioned in that article that
you were talking about the ira and I 

2928
02:10:40,581 --> 02:10:44,510
talked to mr pepperman and he is,
he was in his car pool.

2929
02:10:44,510 --> 02:10:46,730
He was a Vietnam vet.
And uh,

2930
02:10:47,270 --> 02:10:48,810
he once said to me,
uh,

2931
02:10:48,811 --> 02:10:50,330
I have to quote,
he said,

2932
02:10:50,331 --> 02:10:51,950
uh,
you're a skinny little faggot.

2933
02:10:52,130 --> 02:10:55,190
She thank you sir.
And he said,

2934
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:56,600
I'm going to teach you how to lift 
weights.

2935
02:10:56,650 --> 02:10:57,321
And I said,
okay,

2936
02:10:57,321 --> 02:10:59,600
it's more attention than my dad gave me.
So I said I'll take it,

2937
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:03,170
and so he taught me compound lifts at 
the school gym,

2938
02:11:03,171 --> 02:11:05,630
so I bought a sears and roebuck sand 
filled weight set,

2939
02:11:05,631 --> 02:11:06,464
which I couldn't drag too.
My mom stays a vw fastback and 

2940
02:11:09,501 --> 02:11:12,450
eventually I did a buy three months of 
that weight set.

2941
02:11:12,460 --> 02:11:15,010
I'm fairly throwing it across the room 
because you know,

2942
02:11:15,020 --> 02:11:15,853
you're growing so fast,
like your muscles are recovering 

2943
02:11:17,931 --> 02:11:19,910
overnight.
You just do the same workout every day.

2944
02:11:19,911 --> 02:11:20,744
You don't even feel it.
And he said you're not allowed to look 

2945
02:11:22,881 --> 02:11:26,480
at yourself until christmas break after 
christmas exams.

2946
02:11:26,480 --> 02:11:29,000
And this was like in september.
So I didn't.

2947
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:30,163
I did everything he told me to.
And then he dropped me off before the 

2948
02:11:32,991 --> 02:11:33,860
christmas break.
He said,

2949
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:35,840
now today you can look at yourself in 
the mirror.

2950
02:11:36,260 --> 02:11:37,093
And I ran home,
I ran home and I tore my stupid school 

2951
02:11:40,341 --> 02:11:44,120
uniform off and I stood in the mirror 
and my body had definition.

2952
02:11:44,150 --> 02:11:44,983
I'm like,
well,

2953
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:45,913
those are packs of those.
I mean like I looked like I was a guy 

2954
02:11:47,481 --> 02:11:51,350
who lifted some weights and I've.
It was self valIdating.

2955
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:52,790
Like wow,
I'm here.

2956
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:54,980
I did that.
I'm looking at myself going,

2957
02:11:55,250 --> 02:11:58,070
I did that no one can lift those weights
for you.

2958
02:11:58,520 --> 02:12:00,530
And the feeling of achievement it gave 
me,

2959
02:12:00,590 --> 02:12:05,590
that I accomplished that was a shot in 
the arm that I still feel to this day,

2960
02:12:06,980 --> 02:12:08,840
mile.
I mean because it was so like,

2961
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:10,490
wow,
you can do this.

2962
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,323
That's possible.
Because every other time I'm trying to 

2963
02:12:13,371 --> 02:12:16,510
meet girls at the school dance.
I had no guts to talk to the girls.

2964
02:12:16,511 --> 02:12:18,710
So they were alien creatures.
Um,

2965
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:21,020
I didn't do well in school so you can 
make fun of me.

2966
02:12:21,021 --> 02:12:21,854
I couldn't throw the ball straight so 
they would throw it at my head to watch 

2967
02:12:24,081 --> 02:12:25,730
me run.
And so I,

2968
02:12:25,731 --> 02:12:28,040
I,
it didn't have any traction anywhere.

2969
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:29,870
And then when I had the weights I'm 
like,

2970
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:33,650
wow,
I'm filling out my tee shirt,

2971
02:12:33,651 --> 02:12:35,030
man.
Noticeable improvement.

2972
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:35,864
Hell yeah man.
Plus effort equals results and I 

2973
02:12:39,171 --> 02:12:41,340
couldn't,
didn't make my grades better.

2974
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:42,021
[inaudible] I still,
you know,

2975
02:12:42,021 --> 02:12:44,620
is all of swahili to me is a school of 
business.

2976
02:12:44,840 --> 02:12:46,910
It was probably too late.
I just,

2977
02:12:46,911 --> 02:12:48,920
yeah,
I was not good at sitting still,

2978
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:53,540
but when I had the summer jobs,
that's when I kicked ass.

2979
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,950
I never had an allowance.

2980
02:12:54,980 --> 02:12:56,630
I never.
My mom said,

2981
02:12:56,631 --> 02:12:58,160
you never said here's 20 bucks.
I'm like,

2982
02:12:58,161 --> 02:12:58,851
weird.
Henry go.

2983
02:12:58,851 --> 02:13:02,110
He's got three jobs over the weekend.
I'd wake up in the morning,

2984
02:13:02,120 --> 02:13:03,710
go to the pet shop,
work all day.

2985
02:13:03,711 --> 02:13:05,540
They're run home,
shower,

2986
02:13:05,541 --> 02:13:07,970
change my clothes,
do the night shift at the movie theater,

2987
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:10,610
take the bus out to the surf shop In the
suburbs and,

2988
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:13,490
and repair skateboards and whatever on 
sundays.

2989
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:16,040
So I always had pocket money because I 
always,

2990
02:13:16,041 --> 02:13:20,180
I liked having working a cash register 
on my key chain in school.

2991
02:13:20,181 --> 02:13:21,014
I had the keys to stores,
bosses trusted me because I'd never 

2992
02:13:23,751 --> 02:13:24,584
steal and I so I would work like 20 
hours a week and go to school in high 

2993
02:13:31,351 --> 02:13:36,351
school and part of that was informed by 
the weightlifting and I like getting out

2994
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:40,500
of the house and being responsible,
but in school it didn't mean much to me,

2995
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:44,730
but showing up on time at the pet shop 
and cleaning out 20 cat pans.

2996
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:48,030
Man,
that was like I had to be there at 8:00,

2997
02:13:48,031 --> 02:13:49,230
not eight.
Oh one man.

2998
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:54,030
because we got thIngs to do.
I felt a real fealty and to this day,

2999
02:13:54,031 --> 02:13:54,864
like if I'm ever on a film shoot,
like who's the guy who's there early 

3000
02:13:56,821 --> 02:13:57,511
man,
that's me.

3001
02:13:57,511 --> 02:13:58,291
I'm,
I'm there.

3002
02:13:58,291 --> 02:14:01,140
I memorized the whole damn script.
I'm so happy to have a job.

3003
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:03,210
I'm like amazed.
Anyone cares.

3004
02:14:03,510 --> 02:14:04,343
And so all of that,
it keeps me on the straight and narrow 

3005
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:12,120
as I call myself.
A human frozen yogurt machine is output.

3006
02:14:12,570 --> 02:14:14,100
You know,
I don't want the applause.

3007
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:15,690
I don't.
I like to build ships.

3008
02:14:15,691 --> 02:14:16,524
I don't want to in them.
And the best part about finishing the 

3009
02:14:18,831 --> 02:14:21,570
ship is it sales off to see and you can 
build another.

3010
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:25,050
so I love finishing a book.
He'll get this thing off my desktop.

3011
02:14:25,410 --> 02:14:27,930
Now I can start a new one,
like where can I go now?

3012
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:32,790
And so that's how I,
I live to achieve and to output,

3013
02:14:33,300 --> 02:14:36,330
but it's not.
I don't ever look at.

3014
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:37,223
I hAve a thing on my computer,
it's called the list and I keep a list 

3015
02:14:40,471 --> 02:14:43,260
of like every show,
every book I've written,

3016
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:45,390
every movie I've been in,
every album I've ever made.

3017
02:14:45,420 --> 02:14:47,970
And when you look at it,
it's intense.

3018
02:14:47,971 --> 02:14:50,940
It's like you keep a list of every show 
you've ever done.

3019
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:51,571
Oh,
hell yeah,

3020
02:14:51,571 --> 02:14:52,920
of course.
Wow.

3021
02:14:53,810 --> 02:14:55,530
I don't know anybody who does that.
Yeah.

3022
02:14:55,531 --> 02:14:59,000
And sometimes I write down a set length,
uh,

3023
02:14:59,010 --> 02:15:00,770
take a lot of notes.
Wow.

3024
02:15:00,790 --> 02:15:01,623
Yeah.
Write them all down.

3025
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:02,513
But um,
I have this one thing called the list 

3026
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:04,770
and It's just like,
you know,

3027
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:06,030
every film,
every tv show,

3028
02:15:06,031 --> 02:15:08,250
every voiceover,
every book,

3029
02:15:08,251 --> 02:15:10,380
every record on the,
on and on.

3030
02:15:11,220 --> 02:15:12,053
And sometimes I look at it just because 
I have to input like the new book comes 

3031
02:15:14,281 --> 02:15:15,114
out,
I have to go to the thing and input and 

3032
02:15:15,901 --> 02:15:17,910
I look at this list and my bone start 
aching.

3033
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:18,961
Like,
man,

3034
02:15:18,961 --> 02:15:21,390
this is a lot of,
there's a lot of shit,

3035
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:22,690
a lot of crap this came out.
Yeah.

3036
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:26,160
And I don't wave it around and see what 
I've done.

3037
02:15:26,161 --> 02:15:28,110
I just kind of go,
I'm only interested in what I'm doing,

3038
02:15:28,111 --> 02:15:30,360
what I'm doing next.
so why do you record it then?

3039
02:15:30,361 --> 02:15:31,194
Why do you write all that stuff down?
I like leaving a good trail of evidence 

3040
02:15:33,720 --> 02:15:35,430
and I like to be able to,
uh,

3041
02:15:35,910 --> 02:15:36,830
when someone will say,
um,

3042
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:39,780
I saw you in 1985 in champagne,
Illinois.

3043
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:40,141
I'm like,
no,

3044
02:15:40,141 --> 02:15:43,290
that would be 1983 or 1986.
We didn't play there in 1985.

3045
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:45,300
How do you know that?
Here?

3046
02:15:45,360 --> 02:15:46,140
It's right there.
See?

3047
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:47,360
And they're like,
whoa.

3048
02:15:47,810 --> 02:15:50,160
Yeah,
you got to fucking list from 1983.

3049
02:15:50,220 --> 02:15:51,053
Oh,
I have every show since I was in 

3050
02:15:52,891 --> 02:15:55,470
Washington dc with my,
with my first band.

3051
02:15:56,100 --> 02:15:56,933
So you've,
you've written down every single show 

3052
02:15:59,371 --> 02:16:02,400
you've done in your life,
you should publish that.

3053
02:16:02,640 --> 02:16:03,473
Well,
it's in,

3054
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,800
you know,
my,

3055
02:16:04,920 --> 02:16:05,753
my journal books of the years.
I was in black flag that came out as a 

3056
02:16:08,041 --> 02:16:09,240
book.
I did a good.

3057
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:10,980
I mean you should just publIsh that 
list.

3058
02:16:10,981 --> 02:16:13,620
You should put it up online or something
just so people could look at it.

3059
02:16:13,740 --> 02:16:14,150
Yeah,
I,

3060
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:17,130
I have a lot of,
there's a lot of those kind of things,

3061
02:16:17,131 --> 02:16:17,964
so I just want to just so people could 
feel lazy because just to look at that 

3062
02:16:20,671 --> 02:16:21,690
and go,
what in the fuck,

3063
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:22,533
because sometimes you know,
something like that will change the way 

3064
02:16:26,341 --> 02:16:27,174
a person looks at the world to know that
someone like Henry Rollins is out there 

3065
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:30,460
recording

3066
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:32,240
every single show and here's,
here's all the,

3067
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:35,560
like you get this feeling like I'm 
getting this feeling when I'm talking to

3068
02:16:35,561 --> 02:16:36,394
you,
like I want to go do something for real 

3069
02:16:37,890 --> 02:16:39,220
to get out of this inner.
No,

3070
02:16:39,221 --> 02:16:39,701
no,
no.

3071
02:16:39,701 --> 02:16:40,534
I love this interview.
I want to accomplish something like 

3072
02:16:42,371 --> 02:16:43,204
this.
This is something that I like when I 

3073
02:16:44,711 --> 02:16:49,240
talked to people that are really 
motivated and really passionate it,

3074
02:16:49,300 --> 02:16:50,133
it gets me fired up and I'm listening to
you talk aBout this stuff and I want to 

3075
02:16:53,351 --> 02:16:54,184
go do something.

3076
02:16:54,410 --> 02:16:54,931
Yeah.
That,

3077
02:16:54,931 --> 02:16:57,830
that's all you get to do In life.
You get to do stuff and then you die.

3078
02:16:58,730 --> 02:17:01,160
You know,
it's over and it's over fast enough.

3079
02:17:01,161 --> 02:17:02,750
Anyway,
so for me,

3080
02:17:02,751 --> 02:17:04,720
I don't,
I don't tell people what this is a very

3081
02:17:05,020 --> 02:17:07,710
compelling and attractive attitude.
You have those.

3082
02:17:07,740 --> 02:17:09,150
It's very,
very interesting.

3083
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:11,670
Yeah,
it keeps me going and it never gets.

3084
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:16,260
I never get to that point where I've 
been to enough places where I've written

3085
02:17:16,261 --> 02:17:20,400
enough books or have done enough radio 
shows or I bought enough records.

3086
02:17:20,401 --> 02:17:21,234
There's never enough records,
there's never enough time to do 

3087
02:17:23,791 --> 02:17:27,090
everything.
and I like living with that kind of,

3088
02:17:27,091 --> 02:17:27,924
um,
aspect of desperation where you're 

3089
02:17:30,811 --> 02:17:31,621
always kInd of like,
oh,

3090
02:17:31,621 --> 02:17:32,700
come on man,
let's go.

3091
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:35,430
Uh,
and I liked that because it keeps the,

3092
02:17:35,490 --> 02:17:36,323
as I say,
it keeps the blood thin and it keeps 

3093
02:17:38,281 --> 02:17:40,880
complacency at the door.
And I said,

3094
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:42,570
I have my bad days.
I'm like,

3095
02:17:42,571 --> 02:17:43,620
anyone else?
I'm just a,

3096
02:17:43,640 --> 02:17:44,473
you know,
an example.

3097
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:44,970
Your,

3098
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:48,210
your bad days would probably ridiculous.
You're burning so hot.

3099
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:49,290
I mean,
your bad days.

3100
02:17:49,291 --> 02:17:52,500
It probably like an average ambitious 
person's quality time.

3101
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:53,470
I don't know.
I mean,

3102
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:54,390
I don't know,
man.

3103
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:58,480
It's pretty intense,
but it's one of the reasons why I picked

3104
02:17:58,570 --> 02:18:02,770
the people I work with.
Like today you met heidi who manages not

3105
02:18:02,771 --> 02:18:06,850
only me but all my companies and she's 
basically,

3106
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:07,773
she's,
she and I had been working together for 

3107
02:18:08,621 --> 02:18:09,454
damn near 20 years.
She's amazing and she's air traffic 

3108
02:18:12,641 --> 02:18:14,800
control.
Cause if I'm not,

3109
02:18:14,801 --> 02:18:15,634
I've never careful.
I say yes to every damn thing and she's 

3110
02:18:17,671 --> 02:18:19,030
like,
you can't say yes to that because you're

3111
02:18:19,031 --> 02:18:20,730
going to be over here on this day.
She goes,

3112
02:18:20,890 --> 02:18:22,600
stop answering the phone.
I got this.

3113
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:23,583
So she like,
she's the one who coordinated all this 

3114
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:27,490
with you because I,
you know,

3115
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:31,060
I'll go and do it,
but I'm not good at setting it up.

3116
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:32,223
And so she locks in the coordinates.
And so I work with people who are used 

3117
02:18:36,521 --> 02:18:41,521
to kind of my velocity,
like the road manager in a way.

3118
02:18:43,030 --> 02:18:45,180
I'm very easy on road manager ward.
Same.

3119
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:46,083
I wake up,
I go to the front of the bus and he's 

3120
02:18:47,351 --> 02:18:50,050
already written out the map for me to 
walk to a gym.

3121
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:51,033
So I wake up,
I go right to the gym and I always want 

3122
02:18:52,811 --> 02:18:54,100
the same thing.
I want to jim,

3123
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:55,990
I want this,
I want a gig.

3124
02:18:55,991 --> 02:18:58,990
And then I want some sushi and I want to
go to sleep and so,

3125
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:00,543
but it's intense and there's hardly any 
days off so he knows how to keep all of 

3126
02:19:05,561 --> 02:19:06,394
that going and the phone is ringing 
because I work in different media all 

3127
02:19:09,551 --> 02:19:10,384
the time.
And so heidi is always juggling a chain 

3128
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:17,190
saws and so I'm around people who can 
allow me just to really run at it and go

3129
02:19:20,141 --> 02:19:23,740
as fast and as hard as I want to.
I call it living at the speed of life.

3130
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:28,610
He just kind of go,
you let your Imagination in your resolve

3131
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:33,940
dictate everything and to be able to do 
that and still keep the lights on.

3132
02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:37,700
I'm just a lucky bastard.
And so I,

3133
02:19:37,701 --> 02:19:41,750
I try and be really cool about it.
So with this humility is very contagIous

3134
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:42,710
too.
It's very nice.

3135
02:19:42,711 --> 02:19:45,680
It's very nice to hear that you have 
this attitude in our line of work.

3136
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:48,830
I don't know everything about you,
but you know,

3137
02:19:48,831 --> 02:19:51,680
you and I do enough for the same stuff.
Come on man.

3138
02:19:51,681 --> 02:19:52,514
we get in free to stuff all the time.
Doors open stuff that other people pay 

3139
02:19:56,181 --> 02:19:57,014
for.
They just give you a tour of a man 

3140
02:19:57,771 --> 02:19:58,604
because they disliked the fact that you 
came by and so the only way not to be a 

3141
02:20:03,411 --> 02:20:04,244
jerk wIth all of that is to don't take 
it too seriously and to be as grateful 

3142
02:20:09,681 --> 02:20:10,514
as possible.

3143
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:14,000
And that's what we're.
Several minutes ago I said I've met,

3144
02:20:14,001 --> 02:20:14,834
you know,
some big movie stars and rock star 

3145
02:20:16,161 --> 02:20:17,780
types.
The bigger they Are,

3146
02:20:17,781 --> 02:20:18,614
the more grateful they are because they 
know they are just lucky bastards and 

3147
02:20:21,501 --> 02:20:22,331
all like the,
you know,

3148
02:20:22,331 --> 02:20:23,780
the,
your acd season,

3149
02:20:23,781 --> 02:20:26,670
black sabbath that I've met that are 
like the most humble know.

3150
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:27,523
They're just so happy.
They got a gig and it's going pretty 

3151
02:20:29,781 --> 02:20:33,350
well and they just know that they beat 
the grind.

3152
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:35,510
They obviously had something to bear.
Uh,

3153
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,210
they had something that the world says 
wow about,

3154
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:39,523
but they also at the same time know that
they're not going to take the same 

3155
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:43,443
training,
that a lot of really good people who 

3156
02:20:45,231 --> 02:20:48,290
don't deserve it or going to take what 
boot koski wrote about.

3157
02:20:48,291 --> 02:20:48,681
He says,
man,

3158
02:20:48,681 --> 02:20:51,710
you got to beat the grind because man,
this life will kill you.

3159
02:20:51,740 --> 02:20:56,740
It'll just use you up and so I'm not 
looking to escape any beatings,

3160
02:20:57,290 --> 02:21:02,290
but to have an Idea and get to do it and
turn it into something that kind of pays

3161
02:21:03,261 --> 02:21:06,560
me like I can go into the world,
has these crazy things happen.

3162
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:09,470
Come back with photographs and a story.
Take it on stage.

3163
02:21:09,471 --> 02:21:13,160
I can tour on that and people show up.
Damn man.

3164
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:16,370
I should just be saying thank you every 
other breath and that.

3165
02:21:16,371 --> 02:21:17,980
That's what I try and maintain.
Well you are,

3166
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:21,020
you're obviously very prolific.
What do you do with all your money?

3167
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:24,620
You seem like a guy who probably were 
those kinds of clothes everyday.

3168
02:21:24,621 --> 02:21:26,300
All the time.
Probably living in a pocket.

3169
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:27,650
Trying 20th.
These.

3170
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,513
Yeah.
A little bit of department now I got a 

3171
02:21:30,051 --> 02:21:30,630
house.
Yeah.

3172
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:32,900
Wow.
So I have a lot of records and so,

3173
02:21:32,901 --> 02:21:34,250
uh,
you need some room.

3174
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:35,470
Um,
I,

3175
02:21:35,790 --> 02:21:36,623
I spend money on records,
plane tickets and the occasional lens 

3176
02:21:40,251 --> 02:21:41,810
for a camera,
you know,

3177
02:21:42,230 --> 02:21:44,690
but by and large costs a lot.
No,

3178
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,540
I drive a mazda six watts.
Yeah.

3179
02:21:47,990 --> 02:21:50,750
Do you do that on purpose?
I live in la,

3180
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:52,250
man.
Do you fly economy,

3181
02:21:52,251 --> 02:21:53,084
you one of those motherfuckers?
I have over a million miles on united 

3182
02:21:56,781 --> 02:21:58,760
and I probably tried to upgrade you 
like.

3183
02:21:58,761 --> 02:21:58,991
No,
no,

3184
02:21:58,991 --> 02:21:59,570
no,
no,

3185
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:00,030
no,
no.

3186
02:22:00,030 --> 02:22:01,040
The ilc?
No,

3187
02:22:01,090 --> 02:22:03,860
I,
I save them up for when I go on tour.

3188
02:22:03,861 --> 02:22:08,630
Like last year I was in Australia twice 
and so that's where I use the miles.

3189
02:22:09,230 --> 02:22:11,720
But Australia economy.
Well no,

3190
02:22:11,721 --> 02:22:15,110
I upgraded into business because I had 
already saved up the miles,

3191
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:17,240
but usually I fly economy.
Yeah.

3192
02:22:17,480 --> 02:22:18,313
Why do you do that?
Because I will not justify spending 

3193
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:21,733
$2,000
for more leg room for seven hours 

3194
02:22:23,421 --> 02:22:26,040
because you can buy like a truckload of 
records of that money.

3195
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:28,260
Right?
But you already have that $2,000

3196
02:22:28,261 --> 02:22:30,690
in the bank.
I need that $2,000.

3197
02:22:31,230 --> 02:22:35,990
I was really broke ass in a band for 
many years and the,

3198
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:40,550
all the money I made it came with a lot 
of sweat and a lot of pain and I,

3199
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:41,443
I must respect it and to.
And I'm not saying to put yourself in 

3200
02:22:45,541 --> 02:22:48,030
business classes being disrespectful to 
money.

3201
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:52,020
What I'm saying is I can't justify it.
I simply cannot go.

3202
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:54,240
That was worth it.
I can't do it.

3203
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:56,760
I just can't.
How many records do you think you have?

3204
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,370
I don't know.
It's like triples.

3205
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:01,350
Mandate is keep showing up.
Wow.

3206
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:05,670
I last night I listened to 10 records.
five lps in five singles.

3207
02:23:05,671 --> 02:23:09,000
And when you sit down and listen to 
records or is this a solitary pursuit?

3208
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:10,920
Just headphones on.
Oh,

3209
02:23:10,921 --> 02:23:11,490
no,
no,

3210
02:23:11,490 --> 02:23:13,140
no.
I'm in front of a pair of,

3211
02:23:13,141 --> 02:23:14,250
uh,
wilson xlf.

3212
02:23:14,250 --> 02:23:16,260
Sophia three's a.
Yeah.

3213
02:23:16,610 --> 02:23:17,540
What is that?
They're like,

3214
02:23:17,650 --> 02:23:19,140
they're like,
he's an audio engineer.

3215
02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:20,490
He just started typing as soon as you 
said that.

3216
02:23:20,491 --> 02:23:21,324
Yeah.
You type them in and your laptop will 

3217
02:23:22,381 --> 02:23:23,710
go,
damn,

3218
02:23:24,430 --> 02:23:26,310
I'm there.
It's a good system,

3219
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:27,173
but it's a.
The one thing I miss when I'm on the 

3220
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:34,101
road is my music just easy access to 
analog and so on and off the road,

3221
02:23:34,830 --> 02:23:35,663
I have a file on my computer called.
I heard that and I write down every 

3222
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:42,750
record I listened to in the order.
I listened to it the exact pressing.

3223
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:46,050
Like last night I listened to a david 
bowie single golden years with,

3224
02:23:46,051 --> 02:23:48,420
can you hear me?
But with the pressing from El Salvador,

3225
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:53,460
and I had to write that down because I'm
that guy.

3226
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:55,730
You have a picture of the wilson?
Uh,

3227
02:23:56,280 --> 02:23:58,320
alexandria three's.
Wow.

3228
02:23:58,321 --> 02:23:59,154
So you just.
So when you're sitting down and you're 

3229
02:24:00,691 --> 02:24:01,524
enjoying this music,
you're just sitting down and enjoying 

3230
02:24:03,151 --> 02:24:04,500
this music.
You're not doing this.

3231
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:05,820
Oh wow.
Those are bad ass.

3232
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:06,571
Oh no,
no,

3233
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:07,050
no,
no.

3234
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:08,700
A few.
A few models up my friend.

3235
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:10,920
I've got those two.
Those are,

3236
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,480
those are.
So sophie is go to the out,

3237
02:24:12,481 --> 02:24:13,500
go to alexandria.

3238
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:19,920
There you go.
Yeah.

3239
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,880
They're so big.
It tastes.

3240
02:24:20,881 --> 02:24:22,830
It takes a while to buffer.
Whoa.

3241
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:25,870
Yeah.
There's 660 pounds each wax.

3242
02:24:25,990 --> 02:24:27,300
Yeah.
These are in your living room.

3243
02:24:27,930 --> 02:24:30,690
Holy shit.
Now what is the benefit of these?

3244
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:32,070
Oh,
they sound good.

3245
02:24:32,160 --> 02:24:35,550
And frequency as realized without even 
pushing the system.

3246
02:24:35,880 --> 02:24:37,650
It's a system.
You don't play loud,

3247
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:38,753
you just,
you can play it at medium and it's full 

3248
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:43,320
saturation of frequency.
What the fuck?

3249
02:24:43,321 --> 02:24:45,470
Look at these goddamn things.
Miners,

3250
02:24:45,490 --> 02:24:46,800
silver coins,
this website.

3251
02:24:46,801 --> 02:24:48,290
So shit.
It's not our,

3252
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:50,790
our internet services.
Fast as fuck.

3253
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:54,920
Let's just get a shitty about the web.
These are probably some weirdos,

3254
02:24:54,930 --> 02:24:55,763
just like ham peak because they're just 
meticulous builders and it takes a 

3255
02:24:59,181 --> 02:25:00,720
while.
Look at those speakers.

3256
02:25:00,721 --> 02:25:02,880
That's insane.
It's a stack.

3257
02:25:02,910 --> 02:25:03,743
So you have two stacks and you just face
him towards you and you said in your 

3258
02:25:05,791 --> 02:25:06,240
couch.

3259
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

3260
02:25:07,501 --> 02:25:09,930
And then I'm looking at those and the,
uh,

3261
02:25:10,050 --> 02:25:13,310
that is uh,
a maniacs stereo system there.

3262
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,520
Yeah.
Okay.

3263
02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:15,354
So you.
And so that's what I miss when I'm on 

3264
02:25:16,381 --> 02:25:18,430
the road are those two.
And uh,

3265
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:22,260
when I come home I play a lot of records
and so last night,

3266
02:25:22,610 --> 02:25:24,400
uh,
to listen to all that music,

3267
02:25:24,401 --> 02:25:28,120
it took about four hours or so to get 
through all that music.

3268
02:25:28,121 --> 02:25:30,620
And you're just sitting there taking in 
the songs.

3269
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:31,890
I'm writing your writing.
Yeah.

3270
02:25:31,930 --> 02:25:36,820
I'm taking notes on things and I'm 
working on writing in my journal and uh,

3271
02:25:37,010 --> 02:25:37,843
just writing and listening.
I got a cup of coffee and a cold cup of 

3272
02:25:42,791 --> 02:25:43,620
coffee.
Yeah,

3273
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:45,660
it's from.
I made it a the night before actually.

3274
02:25:46,120 --> 02:25:47,920
And uh,
and so I'm drinking the,

3275
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:50,530
the low at the second half of this cold,
stale coffee.

3276
02:25:50,700 --> 02:25:55,540
Jesus christ and a half a glass of 
perrier water.

3277
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:57,610
I liked that line.
Bubbly water.

3278
02:25:58,020 --> 02:26:01,660
And that's uh,
that's my big kick ass night.

3279
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:02,503
Like this weekend,
a band called sleep is opening for the 

3280
02:26:05,651 --> 02:26:07,750
melvins and they're playing two nights 
at the fonda,

3281
02:26:07,751 --> 02:26:10,510
so I'm going to both nights because I 
love both bands.

3282
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:12,550
And so if there's a gig in town,
I'm going,

3283
02:26:12,551 --> 02:26:14,380
if they play in two nights,
I go both nights.

3284
02:26:14,440 --> 02:26:19,240
So you're still deeply involved in music
and as far as you being a fan.

3285
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,393
Huge,
but you just don't have the desire to 

3286
02:26:22,301 --> 02:26:23,280
perform.
And you know,

3287
02:26:23,310 --> 02:26:23,950
I,
I,

3288
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:24,783
I,
I came into music being a fan and I 

3289
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:27,471
left.
I,

3290
02:26:27,471 --> 02:26:29,150
I will always be a fan.
It,

3291
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,120
it,
it,

3292
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,293
it's,
it's a drag when you meet a musician 

3293
02:26:32,471 --> 02:26:34,190
who's not a fan of music,
like,

3294
02:26:34,191 --> 02:26:35,150
oh,
come on man.

3295
02:26:35,151 --> 02:26:36,460
Like no one's like,
oh,

3296
02:26:36,461 --> 02:26:38,260
these bands all suck.
I could really don't.

3297
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:40,800
I feel the same way about comedians that
aren't a fan of standup.

3298
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:42,420
I love standup.
It's still loves,

3299
02:26:42,421 --> 02:26:43,670
stand up and it's,
it's.

3300
02:26:43,700 --> 02:26:47,970
I think that's something that people 
lose somewhere along the line sometimes.

3301
02:26:47,971 --> 02:26:48,804
Some of them do it.
It's really sad when I go to gigs all 

3302
02:26:50,621 --> 02:26:53,380
the time.
It's funny,

3303
02:26:53,381 --> 02:26:55,870
but it's also sad a lot of times these 
bands,

3304
02:26:55,871 --> 02:26:57,610
right?
BecAuse I play them on my radio show.

3305
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:59,680
Hey man,
we're coming to the echo next week.

3306
02:26:59,681 --> 02:27:01,200
We're going on at 1130.
I'm like,

3307
02:27:01,201 --> 02:27:02,620
and it's a tuesday man,
I can't,

3308
02:27:03,070 --> 02:27:05,580
I can't go see you at 1130 at night.
Why is that?

3309
02:27:05,800 --> 02:27:07,600
Just too damn tired.
And I'm like,

3310
02:27:07,601 --> 02:27:08,434
damn,
I'm really my age because you say 1130 

3311
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:12,370
on a tuesday to start a gig.
I'm like,

3312
02:27:12,850 --> 02:27:13,683
I'm sorry,
daddy just got really tired and I just 

3313
02:27:16,571 --> 02:27:17,440
have to go.
Sorry man.

3314
02:27:17,500 --> 02:27:18,333
You know,
I can't do that and be at my office the 

3315
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:21,393
next day.
wow.

3316
02:27:21,610 --> 02:27:24,190
I want to uh,
it was a friday.

3317
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:25,930
Yeah.
Or christmas break.

3318
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:27,001
But um,
I'll,

3319
02:27:27,001 --> 02:27:27,834
I'll go.
I'll be at the fonda both nights this 

3320
02:27:29,021 --> 02:27:30,310
weekend.
Seeing those bands.

3321
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:32,740
So when you say if it's a friday,
so on weekends,

3322
02:27:32,741 --> 02:27:33,574
do you have like a,
like a relaxed schedule on saturday and 

3323
02:27:35,621 --> 02:27:37,540
sunday?
Do you allow yourself some leisure?

3324
02:27:37,610 --> 02:27:42,610
I'll sleep as long as I want and I 
listened to different records during the

3325
02:27:42,730 --> 02:27:43,210
week.
I listened.

3326
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:46,120
I do protein listening,
which is records I hAven't heard yet.

3327
02:27:46,570 --> 02:27:47,470
And so just,
you know,

3328
02:27:47,471 --> 02:27:49,210
you have to really concentrate on the 
weekends.

3329
02:27:49,211 --> 02:27:50,044
I do carbohydrate listening,
whereas the records that I'm familiar 

3330
02:27:53,021 --> 02:27:54,640
with that I just like to listen to.
Wow.

3331
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:57,800
So just like a sort of a light thing.
Well just like songs,

3332
02:27:57,801 --> 02:27:58,330
like,
you know,

3333
02:27:58,330 --> 02:27:59,163
albums I've had for 25 years that I 
still liked to listen to and that's 

3334
02:28:02,171 --> 02:28:02,541
like,
you know,

3335
02:28:02,541 --> 02:28:03,374
Chile and soup and bread and potatoes 
and then during the week it's just 

3336
02:28:06,341 --> 02:28:09,040
shimmy me,
clap pushups.

3337
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:13,070
You know,
what a strange life you have men.

3338
02:28:13,071 --> 02:28:13,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

3339
02:28:14,110 --> 02:28:16,600
it's very original.
Tell you that it's different,

3340
02:28:17,070 --> 02:28:18,970
you know,
be weird.

3341
02:28:18,971 --> 02:28:20,200
Live where you know,
weird,

3342
02:28:20,201 --> 02:28:23,120
this is weird does I guess.
Well you get involved in relationships,

3343
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:23,993
you getting a girlfriend or something 
like that and they realize failed what 

3344
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:28,190
they're getting involved with.
They're like,

3345
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:29,053
oh,
jesus christ was more what I'm getting 

3346
02:28:30,501 --> 02:28:31,334
involved with.
And I realized I can't hack it because 

3347
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:36,890
here's the awful thing about being an 
adult in a relationship,

3348
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:39,410
seeking to be an adult in a 
relationship.

3349
02:28:40,070 --> 02:28:40,910
I have found,
uh,

3350
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,520
when I was young and I was a boy and I 
was dating girls,

3351
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,290
it's boys and girls and she's an idiot,
you're an idiot,

3352
02:28:46,390 --> 02:28:48,770
you do dumb things and if cheats and 
whatever,

3353
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:52,850
then you hit a certain part of your life
where she's a woman and you're a man and

3354
02:28:52,851 --> 02:28:53,684
you have adult expectations and you 
can't be running around being an idiot 

3355
02:28:58,760 --> 02:28:59,593
with someone who kind of wants you to be
at the table because they are sincerely 

3356
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:07,640
giving time of their adult life to this 
thing that you were doing together.

3357
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:08,743
And when you come in still thinking 
you're in ninth grade and she's coming 

3358
02:29:11,631 --> 02:29:12,464
in like,
this is part of what my life is being 

3359
02:29:16,851 --> 02:29:21,851
with you.
I have never been able to answer that in

3360
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:26,600
a mature enough way to where I would 
have been able to maintain it.

3361
02:29:27,140 --> 02:29:30,980
Because like say next weekend if I had a
girlfriend,

3362
02:29:30,981 --> 02:29:32,780
she might say,
it's friday.

3363
02:29:32,781 --> 02:29:33,740
What are we doing?
I'm like,

3364
02:29:33,770 --> 02:29:36,530
oh,
watching me write for four hours,

3365
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:40,190
and so that's not the way to be.
You can't do that.

3366
02:29:40,270 --> 02:29:44,880
And so I can't be a good persons other 
half because I'm always,

3367
02:29:45,080 --> 02:29:50,080
the work has always attracted me more 
than coming home to someone.

3368
02:29:50,450 --> 02:29:51,283
Wow.
Like I can't stand the idea of someone 

3369
02:29:53,770 --> 02:29:54,603
of living with a person.
I can do it on the bus because it's das 

3370
02:29:57,381 --> 02:29:58,370
boat and work,
you know,

3371
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,560
going down the road.
Um,

3372
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:01,873
but I,
I never would want to like wake up and 

3373
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:08,000
she's there and I have no aversion.

3374
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,520
Get expressed to,
to look to your right.

3375
02:30:13,950 --> 02:30:15,080
She's,
well,

3376
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:20,450
it's every day here we are together and 
I'm just not wired that way.

3377
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:24,020
I would be a drag like,
you haven't spoken to me in 20 hours.

3378
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:25,363
Huh?
I didn't notice and I'm just a work 

3379
02:30:28,101 --> 02:30:29,980
oriented and so,
and I,

3380
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:33,110
I'm not interested in wasting anyone's 
time.

3381
02:30:33,440 --> 02:30:35,870
I'm not interested in being mean.
I'm really not into it.

3382
02:30:36,170 --> 02:30:37,003
And so I'm not.
The woman was hitting on me a while ago 

3383
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:42,464
and I said,
ma'am,

3384
02:30:43,420 --> 02:30:44,990
I call her ma'am.
That's a problem.

3385
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:48,620
She was very persistent and I said,
ma'am,

3386
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:52,160
I'm,
I'm like a hunting dog.

3387
02:30:52,490 --> 02:30:54,620
I'm a dog.
Just not the kind you pat,

3388
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:56,150
you know,
I'm just not,

3389
02:30:58,190 --> 02:30:59,390
I'm just,
I'm sorry,

3390
02:31:00,070 --> 02:31:02,030
just,
you should stop this.

3391
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:05,760
She's imagining holding your hand,
coming to your spoken word shows,

3392
02:31:05,761 --> 02:31:09,590
going and going to dinner with you and 
talk about your day and um,

3393
02:31:09,710 --> 02:31:10,543
and you're like in front of your fucking
crazy speakers and your writing and 

3394
02:31:14,210 --> 02:31:16,190
hoping the phone doesn't ring right.

3395
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:17,113
Uh,
I unplug it on the weekends except on 

3396
02:31:19,501 --> 02:31:21,810
sunday.
my best friend since I was a 11,

3397
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:23,790
12 and he was 11.
We're still best friends.

3398
02:31:23,970 --> 02:31:25,400
Ian,
you ever heard the band fugazi?

3399
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:26,071
Yes.
okay.

3400
02:31:26,071 --> 02:31:26,904
Well ian mci the now he's my best friend
and we grew up together doing music and 

3401
02:31:30,211 --> 02:31:32,070
everything and we talk almost every 
sunday.

3402
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:33,091
And so,
uh,

3403
02:31:33,091 --> 02:31:33,924
we've been best friends since the carter
administration and so ian will call on 

3404
02:31:39,271 --> 02:31:40,980
sunday.
We'll talk for awhile.

3405
02:31:41,070 --> 02:31:43,870
Otherwise the phone doesn't ring if it 
does,

3406
02:31:43,871 --> 02:31:44,550
I'm like,
oh no.

3407
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:45,241
Why?
Well,

3408
02:31:45,241 --> 02:31:46,690
I thought you liked me.
Why are you calling?

3409
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:53,800
I,
yeah,

3410
02:31:56,670 --> 02:31:58,710
if you liked me,
he wouldn't write me.

3411
02:31:59,670 --> 02:32:04,670
But meanwhile,
I'm contentedly just working away and so

3412
02:32:06,850 --> 02:32:09,340
I'm good for like a race horse,
uh,

3413
02:32:09,460 --> 02:32:11,010
just watched me running around the 
track,

3414
02:32:11,011 --> 02:32:11,910
but don't,
don't,

3415
02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:16,260
don't need to feed me any trainer.
Rigid in your behavior pattern.

3416
02:32:16,290 --> 02:32:19,200
You mean you've got it locked in,
he know what you enjoy,

3417
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:20,790
you know,
it makes you content.

3418
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:21,833
What gives you happiness and 
appreciation and it's kind of a 

3419
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,660
replicant vulcan,
you know,

3420
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:28,494
it doesn't.
Humans don't have play a large part in 

3421
02:32:31,351 --> 02:32:33,180
it.
Like I don't need to go hang out with my

3422
02:32:33,181 --> 02:32:35,910
friends on the weekend and hey man,
you didn't call him man.

3423
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:36,990
What's going on?
I don't,

3424
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:37,800
don't,
don't call.

3425
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:38,633
But you do appreciate those humans that 
come to see you perform and you feel a 

3426
02:32:41,251 --> 02:32:43,050
deep obligation to them.
Absolutely.

3427
02:32:43,051 --> 02:32:45,030
Yeah.
And I serve them and I love.

3428
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:46,000
I like servitude.

3429
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,970
I like wanting to give them something 
good.

3430
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:53,130
I make the best hash I possibly can.
And then I sling it with everything I've

3431
02:32:53,131 --> 02:32:53,964
got.
I just don't want to hang around 

3432
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:58,290
afterwards and talk about it.
Has to do it.

3433
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:00,930
If I,
if I could just say thank you,

3434
02:33:00,931 --> 02:33:02,910
goodnight.
Walk out of the building and do a moving

3435
02:33:02,911 --> 02:33:06,180
vehicle and be 10 blocks down the road 
before they get up out of their seats.

3436
02:33:06,181 --> 02:33:07,770
That would be fine.
It's just,

3437
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:12,450
I don't know what else there is to do 
except hit it and then quit it.

3438
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:14,093
And so it makes some interactions a 
little uncomfortable and that I liked 

3439
02:33:18,991 --> 02:33:19,824
these people write a lot.
They have no idea how much I just want 

3440
02:33:24,071 --> 02:33:26,940
to just rock their world with like a 
book or a show.

3441
02:33:27,450 --> 02:33:30,030
But beyond that I,
hey,

3442
02:33:30,031 --> 02:33:31,170
come and hang out with us on it.

3443
02:33:31,650 --> 02:33:34,590
I don't know how to do that.
But you do get appreciation from hanging

3444
02:33:34,591 --> 02:33:36,470
out with people that you meet when you 
go on your journeys.

3445
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:37,500
Sure.
Uh,

3446
02:33:37,580 --> 02:33:39,180
you,
you meet someone on the road,

3447
02:33:39,570 --> 02:33:41,610
like some guy in his village.
All right,

3448
02:33:41,611 --> 02:33:42,460
so man,
how's your,

3449
02:33:42,510 --> 02:33:43,620
what's your day like?
You know,

3450
02:33:43,621 --> 02:33:44,670
what are you eating?
Okay.

3451
02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:46,710
Where you get your water from.
Show me that.

3452
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:47,673
And then like,
do you differentiate them because 

3453
02:33:48,481 --> 02:33:50,950
they're so unusual and their life is so,
you know,

3454
02:33:51,170 --> 02:33:53,100
it's information extraction.
You're just,

3455
02:33:53,101 --> 02:33:54,870
you don't really know that person and 
they're not.

3456
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:56,603
It's just a different relationship.
You don't feel that connection to 

3457
02:33:58,771 --> 02:34:01,080
someone that you meet in real life in 
America.

3458
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:04,440
Like I meet them and I'm polite is a 
sit.

3459
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:09,330
Some people want to like hang out and be
your friend all the time.

3460
02:34:10,020 --> 02:34:11,340
I just don't understand it.

3461
02:34:15,910 --> 02:34:16,743
The same expression she's there and I'm 
not trying to be a jerk just doesn't 

3462
02:34:24,101 --> 02:34:26,060
compute.
And so instead of like,

3463
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:27,910
hey,
we're all going to go down to the park,

3464
02:34:27,911 --> 02:34:28,541
come with.
It's like,

3465
02:34:28,541 --> 02:34:32,380
well how about I just,
I just make you a really good book and,

3466
02:34:33,670 --> 02:34:34,503
and I'll,
I'll,

3467
02:34:34,630 --> 02:34:38,980
I'll price it as cheaply as I can and 
we'll just let that be okay.

3468
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:40,173
Wow.
How about I'll just email you and say I 

3469
02:34:41,951 --> 02:34:42,784
hope you're having a good day and we'll 
just let it go and you don't seem to 

3470
02:34:46,811 --> 02:34:48,640
have any problem with anything that 
you're doing.

3471
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:51,700
like there's not like some things you're
trying to resolve or work through.

3472
02:34:51,701 --> 02:34:54,510
Like this is what you found,
this thing you found this way.

3473
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:58,570
This is my groove and I come from 
Washington dc and I love that.

3474
02:34:58,571 --> 02:34:59,404
I love that city and I go there every 
once in awhile to visit and some nights 

3475
02:35:02,651 --> 02:35:06,970
I visit with my good pal ian of course,
but some nights I just want a mom my own

3476
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:08,073
and I walked all my old jobs and I 
walked by apartment buildings I lived 

3477
02:35:11,621 --> 02:35:12,454
in,
but I walked by people's houses who 

3478
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:16,210
people who grew up with these amazing 
musicians.

3479
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:17,043
They all became big musicians and I know
they're in there sometimes I can even 

3480
02:35:20,801 --> 02:35:24,190
see him in the window.
I don't want to go in.

3481
02:35:24,250 --> 02:35:25,083
I just like walking by their place and 
knowing they're in there and like 

3482
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,630
literally I walked.
I've seen someone I grew up with like on

3483
02:35:31,631 --> 02:35:33,220
the street and I go out there.
He goes,

3484
02:35:33,670 --> 02:35:35,200
okay,
well henry,

3485
02:35:35,201 --> 02:35:36,910
why don't you run up and tap on the 
shoulder and say,

3486
02:35:37,060 --> 02:35:38,410
hey man.
No,

3487
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:40,750
I just liked the fact that I just saw 
him walking.

3488
02:35:40,751 --> 02:35:42,780
ThAt's all I need.
Yeah,

3489
02:35:42,790 --> 02:35:46,690
it's weird and I,
I've been like that since I can remember

3490
02:35:46,990 --> 02:35:50,350
and it gets more like that the older I 
get.

3491
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:52,360
Well,
that would make sense because as you get

3492
02:35:52,361 --> 02:35:54,610
older,
you're more rigid in your ways and your,

3493
02:35:55,110 --> 02:35:58,500
your,
your groove is cut deeper and deeper and

3494
02:35:58,600 --> 02:35:59,433
a lot of this stuff I do,
it takes a bloody long time to finish 

3495
02:36:01,871 --> 02:36:01,960
it.

3496
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,793
You want to write a book,
then you better get ready for the long 

3497
02:36:04,991 --> 02:36:08,290
haul because you'll be working on that 
sucker two years later and you know,

3498
02:36:08,291 --> 02:36:12,850
it just never ends.
Like editing revisions in the tours.

3499
02:36:12,851 --> 02:36:14,200
I go on,
it's not like two weeks.

3500
02:36:14,201 --> 02:36:15,034
It's like it's like 13 months.
Like I'll see you next year that you do 

3501
02:36:19,151 --> 02:36:20,760
that and then you take time off.
Right.

3502
02:36:20,761 --> 02:36:24,010
You didn't let go the long stretch and 
they'll take time away from the tour.

3503
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:26,200
Yeah,
and the only reason is if I had my way,

3504
02:36:26,201 --> 02:36:27,034
I'd be on the road every year and I'd 
have hours of new material and no one 

3505
02:36:29,781 --> 02:36:30,614
would ever get tired of me coming to 
their city once a year and I used to 

3506
02:36:32,831 --> 02:36:33,664
tour like that for years.
It goes out every year and people are 

3507
02:36:36,071 --> 02:36:36,551
like,
henry,

3508
02:36:36,551 --> 02:36:38,290
we love you man,
but you got to start coming here.

3509
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:40,030
Less often,
so a little offensive,

3510
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:41,650
but he just keeps going like,
hey,

3511
02:36:41,651 --> 02:36:42,484
it's me again.
And so then I started doing it every 

3512
02:36:44,291 --> 02:36:45,124
other year and then the,
my promoter types who are happy to take 

3513
02:36:48,251 --> 02:36:49,360
their 15 percent.
They said,

3514
02:36:49,361 --> 02:36:50,320
henry,
we love you man,

3515
02:36:50,321 --> 02:36:51,310
but you got,
you can't,

3516
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:54,700
you can't keep coming.
So often people just getting a little up

3517
02:36:54,701 --> 02:36:56,920
to here with it even every other year.
Yeah.

3518
02:36:57,310 --> 02:36:58,143
And so,
but spoken word and so I would think 

3519
02:37:00,521 --> 02:37:02,590
that that would be enough time for me 
too.

3520
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:03,873
I wish it was.
And so I did what everyone told me to 

3521
02:37:06,341 --> 02:37:07,174
this time around because I know these 
people are all smarter than me and they 

3522
02:37:09,791 --> 02:37:12,160
said,
can you wait a little while longer?

3523
02:37:12,370 --> 02:37:16,880
And so the last big tour is 2012 and I 
went out again in 2016.

3524
02:37:16,881 --> 02:37:20,420
That was four years basically.
I went from one presidential election to

3525
02:37:20,421 --> 02:37:21,254
another and the ticket sales spiked 
everywhere was like london was like 

3526
02:37:28,610 --> 02:37:31,100
$1,500
more tickets than I've ever done there.

3527
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:33,830
I sold out two nights at the sydney 
opera house in sydney.

3528
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:35,480
It was amazing.
And I said,

3529
02:37:35,481 --> 02:37:37,070
what's that about?
Is that you waited,

3530
02:37:37,870 --> 02:37:39,790
he just,
he gave people a time to,

3531
02:37:39,840 --> 02:37:40,673
to,
to forget how long you talk for them 

3532
02:37:44,590 --> 02:37:45,423
and,
and so it's sad to think that I have to 

3533
02:37:48,231 --> 02:37:49,640
wait until 20,
20,

3534
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:53,270
but I can do little weekend here,
a weekend there,

3535
02:37:53,271 --> 02:37:56,000
but I can't go do the lap.
I just did next year.

3536
02:37:56,090 --> 02:37:57,320
No way.
But you want to.

3537
02:37:57,410 --> 02:38:00,170
Oh man.
Yeah.

3538
02:38:00,730 --> 02:38:02,000
Yeah.
I like being on stage.

3539
02:38:02,001 --> 02:38:04,760
I love being in front of those people.
I like giving.

3540
02:38:05,910 --> 02:38:06,743
I guess getting is the hard part.
Like when people applaud at the end of 

3541
02:38:10,380 --> 02:38:11,191
the show,
I just get nervous.

3542
02:38:11,191 --> 02:38:13,710
I just want to run.
I stand there like one,

3543
02:38:13,711 --> 02:38:15,300
1002,
1003,

3544
02:38:15,301 --> 02:38:16,350
1000.
Okay.

3545
02:38:16,351 --> 02:38:17,820
I'm out of here.
Wow.

3546
02:38:18,330 --> 02:38:19,980
Yeah,
it just makes me uncomfortable.

3547
02:38:20,940 --> 02:38:21,530
Wow.

3548
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:22,490
Listen,
Henry Rollins,

3549
02:38:22,491 --> 02:38:23,324
your unique motherfucker.
I don't think I've ever met anybody 

3550
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:25,860
like,
you know,

3551
02:38:26,160 --> 02:38:28,490
I know I have not ever met anybody like 
you,

3552
02:38:28,491 --> 02:38:29,324
but I appreciate you.
I appreciate what you're doing and I 

3553
02:38:31,041 --> 02:38:33,590
appreciate your attitude is very 
contagious.

3554
02:38:33,591 --> 02:38:34,630
It's very exciting.
Thank you.

3555
02:38:34,730 --> 02:38:36,720
So infectious.
And thank you very much for doing this.

3556
02:38:36,730 --> 02:38:37,940
I really,
really appreciate it.

3557
02:38:37,941 --> 02:38:38,930
Thank you.
We got it.

3558
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:40,760
Henry rollins,
ladies and gentlemen.

3559
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:46,870
Great.
