1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,520
Oh God, this is my shot. Don't
fuck this up. Neil Brennan. Oh God.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,570
This is the one,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,280
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by stamps.com I don't

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,370
know if you freaks know this,

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,770
but postage rates are scheduled to
increase again starting September. Well,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,030
you know what?
Here's the thing about postage traits.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,000
You can't really complain because how
much would I have to pay you to take a

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,690
fucking package across the country?
Would you really do it for 10 bucks? Huh?

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,250
Shut your hole.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,970
Would you really send a letter across
the country for less than a dollar?

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,210
How dare you fucks.
So don't complain about the postage rates,

12
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,310
but be aware of them that this Sunday,

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,560
January 26th the post office is going to
hike that shit up. So the post office,

14
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:45,561
I'm sure we'll be even more crowded
then usual with everyone buying updated

15
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:46,651
postage.

16
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:51,651
But the great thing about having
stamps.com is that stamps.com updates the

17
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:54,330
posted rates for you automatically.

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,800
So you'll always get the exact postage
you need for any letter or package.

19
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:03,000
Roy, right from your desk. You printed
out right from your home computer.

20
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,830
It's so easy.

21
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:09,600
It's so much better than going to
the fucking post office itself.

22
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,790
She's this little wheezes
waiting in that ridiculous line,

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,520
bringing all your nonsense up to some
lady who doesn't give two female.

24
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,260
What else said about the post office?
Never the right temperature. That's right.

25
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:25,620
It's always too hot.
I'm going to go always way,

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,770
way too hot and always 83 that's just
cause there's too many people in there

27
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:32,700
that are fuming. They're in
their fucking fuck. Fuck, fuck.

28
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,780
Looking for a pen.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,220
We do generate a lot of body heat
and you give it off like steam.

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,121
Um,

31
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:43,860
stamps.com is a way that you can
do all this stuff from your home.

32
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,970
They give you a digital scale with a
free $55 of postage that you get in the r

33
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,490
he offer, which means if you see
that old school, he microphone,

34
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:55,980
you click on that bitch and the
upper anterior corner. There you go.

35
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,320
And I'm entering the code word j,

36
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:03,390
RN and then we'll give you
this $110 special offer
includes $55 free postage and

37
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:07,740
a digital scale that you want not
to use for mushrooms, Neal Brennan.

38
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:10,210
Now who would do that and not
kind of a person would do.

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,530
That's not what it's for.
Go to stamps.com before you do anything,

40
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,290
click on the microphone at
the top of the homepage.

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Type in j r e that stamps.com and enter
in j r e we are also brought to you by

42
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:27,321
legal zoom and legal zoom is
we know several people used it.

43
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:30,540
Brian used it to become an
incorporated with death squad.

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,520
Aubrey used it for on at.com I I know
at least four or five people that have

45
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,840
used legal zoom instead of actually
going to a lawyer and sitting down and

46
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:44,040
making an appointment and paying
some exorbitant hourly fee.

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,330
Instead of doing that,

48
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,860
you can deal with a lot of legal
shit online with legal zoom.

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,410
They can walk you through it.
It's real easy.

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,560
You can do things like incorporate form
an LLC for starting at just 99 bucks.

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,880
There's not a lawyer alive and
only charges nine $9 an hour.

52
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,490
So if you could do that for a show,
you're saving some money.

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,020
You can also get a last wheel for
just 69 bucks or living trust,

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,100
power of attorney,
more legal zoom gets the job done right.

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,620
Nine out of 10 customers would recommend,

56
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,570
recommend would recommend the
service to their family and friends.

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
And that's a lot.
When you think about legal shit,

58
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:25,180
nine hundred ten nine out of 10 if it's
like nine of 10 people say these shoes

59
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,360
don't hurt your feet. I don't know. I
want tenant. I don't, you know what?

60
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,090
I don't trust that the, I don't
trust that 10th person. Yeah,

61
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,290
at 10 persons always a creep.

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,060
If you just think about like if you're
at a football from jail, if you will.

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,920
Thank you very much. You
did. You stepped in big.

64
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:42,330
If you're ever at a football game
and you know, you could say, oh,

65
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:45,430
there's fucking people that gave her ass
holes. It's not the people at the game.

66
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,930
It's usually like a couple people.

67
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,590
If you're at a fucking stadium
that has 50,000 people in,

68
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,390
there's a hundred cunts. Okay. And
it doesn't mean that you know Philly,

69
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,710
that's fine as bad come to Philander
cuts Philly give more violent,

70
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,810
I wouldn't call them cottons.
There are a lot more violent than cons.

71
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,260
They break your legs, they don't
fuck around. They open with that.

72
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,960
You get personalize affordable
service that you can trust.

73
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,110
And that's why they earned an a plus
from the better business bureau.

74
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,080
That's huge for real.
Uh, in the past 12 years,

75
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:17,560
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

76
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,180
Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

77
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:23,290
but they can connect you with a third
party attorney and they can provide you

78
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,150
with self health services.
So if you panic,

79
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,100
if you're in the middle of using
legal zoom and you're like, fuck,

80
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,810
this is not working, I'm going
to jail, they can connect to you.

81
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,040
It was an independent attorney.
Uh, so don't worry about it.

82
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,970
You're going to be okay. But it couldn't
be any easier. Brian, you've used it.

83
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:40,610
It's easy to use. Very easy. I think I
did it drunk. Remember? That's right.

84
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,380
Probably naked,
naked and drunk and it's still legal,

85
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,140
which is awesome because if you show
up at your attorney's office naked and

86
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,080
drunk, you're going to jail. This is
the opposite. You're not going to jail.

87
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,240
You're protecting yourself.
Okay.

88
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,310
And her in the Codeword
Rogan in the referral box at
checkout and save some cash

89
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,320
senior Rita's and you've seen yours.

90
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,220
They can get you a
copyright patents trademark.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
Their online process.
Couldn't be easier.

92
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,510
League goes zoom.com code word Rogan.
That's,

93
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,430
that's the referral.
That's me bitches.

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,690
And we're also brought to
you by [inaudible] dot com
that's, Oh and, and I it,

95
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,750
if you've heard this podcast
before, you've heard this
fucking commercial before.

96
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,430
There's no other way to do it.

97
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,810
But to ensure you that on it is literally
the best shit that we can find in

98
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:30,130
terms of strength and
conditioning equipment like
kettle bells or gotten roped.

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,380
God, when you hugged me today,
there was an extra form. Yeah,

100
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,790
it was extra force in the heart, you
know, Brennan battle ropes, weight vests,

101
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,490
which you have to be careful. Let me tell
you this. Weight vests and running, um,

102
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,710
be really careful about that.

103
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,320
I know you've probably seen videos
with MMA fighters doing that,

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,600
but when you tend to get exhausted,
you,

105
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,140
you really should be really careful
about running with weight vests on your,

106
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,470
you're loading your body in an
unnatural way. Point this out a lot.

107
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,300
That's how Martin Lawrence
caught a coma is a really,

108
00:05:59,301 --> 00:06:03,170
he was running in the valley.
No, no. He was on drugs.

109
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,140
He was in a winter coat. No, no, no, no.
That wasn't no wait vast. He wasn't. No,

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,000
but he was in a goose down coat
in the valley. 90 degree weather.

111
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:13,370
He's trying to lose weight. It's crack,
bro. Cochlear has a crack. Didn't help.

112
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,520
It doesn't, it definitely didn't
help. Um, we, we sell these,

113
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,810
we have two different types. Kettlebells
we just started selling recently. Um,

114
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,090
primal bowels,
which are all done in apes,

115
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,260
the various great apes like gorilla,
orangutan chimp.

116
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,770
And how I regretted not having
one of those. You'll get one.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,960
Just tell me what you want and I'll
have to send to you. Thank you.

118
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,570
You can't use the grill cause
you're not quite manly enough,

119
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,430
but I'll send you a housing. Mikey. I was
45 pounds. The gorillas, 72 pounds, sir.

120
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,000
You're not manly.
I'm not manly enough to use a gorilla,

121
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,850
but for a few exercises I'm going to
be honest with you people and that's,

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,430
there's a reason for this honesty,
not just self deprecation,

123
00:06:49,431 --> 00:06:53,220
but also to enforce that. If you're
going to do something like kettlebells,

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
please, please, please start slow,

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,340
start slow with a weight
that you can actually handle.

126
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,990
When you throw in kettle bells around,

127
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,310
you are swinging big fucking
heavy iron balls. All right?

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,150
They're legit.

129
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,590
They really are solid metal and they
will fuck you up if you use them wrong.

130
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,670
You can tear joints, you can hurt your
back. You can do all kinds of things.

131
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,900
If you do it wrong, what you should
do is get a small kettle bell,

132
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:20,930
like 35 pounds of, you're a
big, strong manly man like me.

133
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,040
It's plenty especially to start out
with and it's not like something you're

134
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,940
going to outgrow because there are certain
exercises like the DVD that we sell,

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,740
which is the extreme kettlebell cardio
workout with Keith Webber. Got DVD,

136
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:36,430
kicks my ass with 35 pound kettle bells.
It's,

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,940
it's fucking tremendous and these things
will be here long after you're gone.

138
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,280
They will be here after the apocalypse.

139
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:47,630
The fucking aliens will land and they
will find a giant metal gorilla head and

140
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:51,500
they will think that these fucking pink
dummies with their bang sticks and their

141
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:55,280
text messages were worshiping,
worshiping chimps and gorillas.

142
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,350
That's what they're doing that that, that
fucking kettle bell will kick your ass.

143
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,470
That workout. The extreme kettlebell
cardio workout one I haven't done.

144
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:06,200
Number two, they have a two DVD, which
is supposed to be just as vicious,

145
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:09,800
if not more, but look at that sexy
stud, Keith Weber on the cover. Goddamn,

146
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,220
if I looked like him,
I felt so happy about it being him.

147
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,150
You would love to meet him and to let
go and you just start producing estrogen

148
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,290
and nimble. Start dripping on your shirt.
Beaver girls smell you and they're like,

149
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:24,720
what are you fucking smell like milk
bitch. Fuck. And then they lose,

150
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,250
they lose confidence in you
because a man made you grow milk

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,560
on it.com oh and and I t um,

152
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,400
as as far as the supplements go,

153
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,640
we have mostly most of the stuff that
we buy is shit that either Aubrey or I

154
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,060
already use already enjoy things like
we have the best hemp protein powder you

155
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:46,850
can get.

156
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,750
Hemp force is made out of the most
expensive shit that we can get from Canada

157
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,850
and it is really delicious.

158
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:57,600
We F we sweeten it with Stevia so
it has very little sugar in it.

159
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,840
There's like one gram of sugar.
How much protein?

160
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,380
30 grams of protein per
serving per serving. Yeah.

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
How many servings per plant based protein?
He goes right through your body.

162
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:09,860
Nice and easy. It doesn't make you
fart your brains out. Like, wait, we,

163
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,570
I'd love whey protein but I
find that way makes me fart.

164
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,790
How much is this a hemp force is,
oh,

165
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,210
that's a good question. Until you're
right here, I should know this.

166
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,040
4,495 per container, you
know, it's fucked, man.

167
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,520
We could make it a lot cheaper, but
we, uh, we can't grow it in America.

168
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,010
They don't let us there.
They're starting to write now.

169
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:35,300
It's going to be really interesting to
see what happens with Colorado and uh,

170
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,440
what happens with Seattle,
with Washington state,

171
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,380
because if they can successfully
start producing hemp,

172
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,020
which is not psychoactive by the way,

173
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,300
we're not talking about growing pot
flavored chocolate or anything with

174
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,350
chocolate and vanilla. Correct. Both
of them is flavored with Stevia,

175
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,320
both of them with Maka coat,
raw cocoa.

176
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:57,321
It's the most nutritious shit that we
know how to put together or to buy or that

177
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:02,340
we can find. Um, like I said,
we buy the most expensive,

178
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,560
best hemp powder we can get.

179
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,180
Our philosophy is just tried to
give you shit that we use and,

180
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,780
and shit that actually can benefit you.

181
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,380
And in terms of the controversial
things like new mood,

182
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,220
which I actually found out about five
HTP from the man standing across the

183
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:20,970
street from me or the table rather Neil
Brennan told me about five HTP back.

184
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,220
You're the guy I didn't, I had no idea
about it. And I started investigating it.

185
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:30,180
And um, we created new mood with
five HTP and l trip to fan as well,

186
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,490
which converts to five HTP.
Sure does.

187
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,610
So the idea is how long
has it been on the site?

188
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,790
We've had it for awhile and
that's probably the most part,

189
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,370
one of the most popular,
least controversial.

190
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,330
The Alpha brain is the most controversial
because Alpha brain is a nootropic and

191
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:50,331
it's about stimulating neural activity
and creating Le Giving your body the

192
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:51,451
nutrients it needs,

193
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,050
the building blocks to create newer trend
neurotransmitter's and there's science

194
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:56,850
behind it and there's,
you know,

195
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:00,300
there's been studies done on the various
ingredients, but it's still, it's still,

196
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:01,170
for a lot of people,

197
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,920
they see things and they cry bullshit
and for good reason because a lot of

198
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:05,754
things are bullshit.

199
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,050
What's not bullshit nutrients and what's
not bullshit is a science behind these

200
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:14,430
new trends offices explained
at [inaudible] dot com and
we also offer a 30 pill,

202

then you get your money back.

203
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,200
We are only selling you shit
that I know is effective.

204
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:29,610

206
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,430
Jesus Louise's Neal Brennan
could be you be any sweeter.

207
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,413
Hit The music

208
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,403
well good.

209
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,200
Joe Rogan podcast

210
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,910
podcast pastor

211
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,130
television standup

212
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,830
comedian friend Neil,
broken render show friends.

213
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,010
I got a hot tweet right now fucking
bragging about bright red. I'm trending.

214
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:06,070
I literally died a fucking
special on Saturday, not trending.

215
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,110
I have some stupid Richard Sherman tweet.

216
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,180
Literally Neal Brennan is trending in
Houston, Chicago and the United States.

217
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,040
It's that easy.
Boom.

218
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:20,041
One Good Joe Kuhn is all that separates
any of us from trending that it's true.

219
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,550
One good joke or one really controversial
Dick picture that is one of those.

220
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:31,030
And Boom, you're trending Neal
Brennan, you're out there.

221
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,030
You've got the right phone down though.
Don't you know add on me. No, I'm not. No,

222
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:37,840
I won't have to your computer. So I feel
a little jealous cause we work here.

223
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,290
Actually, I'm actually trying to
put together a show. Oh my fault.

224
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,040
You guys are building.
No,

225
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,550
I mean it looks like we're just
fucking around and going online.

226
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,030
Most of the time you are. Sometimes
it's like life, man. Okay.

227
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,990
Fucking around as a part of life.
Life is a part of the show. It's not,

228
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,750
don't be too rigid. When you're
rigid, you miss possibilities.

229
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,720
You know what I'm saying? Go on. And
we know that in any wrong, come on.

230
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm the king of WHO's more flexible,
was more flexible than Neil Brennan.

231
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,250
Are you flexible? I wonder who is more
physically flexible. Me. Are you, oh,

232
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,980
I'm way more flexible. Okay. For sure.
Can you do the splits or anything?

233
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,040
Can't it really? Fuck you
always surprise me. Well,

234
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,990
I did taekwondo from the
time it was a baby. Yeah.

235
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,870
You are you really flexible
and you unusually kind of like,

236
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:23,380
I can, I don't have, it's like I don't
have a lot of tendons or something.

237
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,570
You're lacking pass, so you
just, yeah, I didn't do, yeah,

238
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:31,240
there's a picture of me doing this split.
See, boom. I'm not just talking shit.

239
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,970
Go Neal Brennan.
I'm just crazy.

240
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,490
I was texting me like Rick
variation there as well.

241
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,760
Even impossible with your man Dick.
It was like sitting like it.

242
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:43,090
They just feel good. You've got to pull
it up. You pull it up and then you,

243
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,300
you buck your hips forward and
then you let your Dick drop. Yeah,

244
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:50,080
but you don't want to do a split on your
Dick. That's really bad for your Dick.

245
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,170
It's a lot of pressure. You Dick's not
especially with like a hardwood floor.

246
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,840
Think about that. You're squashing
your dick on a hardwood floor.

247
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:59,080
You could fucking hurt your
balls that way as well. Um, yeah.

248
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,090
My dog almost hurts my balls
a lot. Your dog. Yeah. No.

249
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,080
My three year old jumps on my balls. Yeah,
my dog jumps on my balls all the time.

250
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,500
I let her jump on top. She like,
uh, if I'm lying on the bed,

251
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:12,520
she'll come up and grab my hands and
just jump up and stomp on my abs. I,

252
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:12,941
and I'm like,

253
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:15,460
it's a good ab workout just to get
a little kid to go fucking crazy.

254
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:18,060
But occasionally she'll miss the amps,
the cocker room.

255
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,150
I'd like to open with a good ball story.
Buddy of mine won't say who it was.

256
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,010
Uh, having sex with a
girl, a titty fucking her,

257
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,880
which this is my buddy who just likes to
titty. Fuck, but I don't know who that,

258
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:31,780
who am I to judge?

259
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,800
I have zero interest in titty
fucking that's fifth place to me.

260
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,960
That's my boy.
I know what you're doing.

261
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,000
You're just setting up a nice titty
fucking scenario later. I will,

262
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:46,600
under no circumstances will I tinny fuck
any woman who comes to the valley and

263
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:49,990
there's going to be a girl after
your show holding delicious tits,

264
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,920
like absolutely perfect ones.

265
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,590
And I will not have a challenge.
I challenge her on,

266
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,550
what'd you say about titty fucking and
they're going to be big and real buddy of

267
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:02,660
mine titty. Fucking okay.
Uh, he's about to finish.

268
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,160
He says to the girl,
squeeze them together. Okay.

269
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,230
She grabs his nuts and squeezes
them as hard as she can.

270
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,590
Comes like Bob came.

271
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,990
He came come and blood.
Oh my God.

272
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,380
She broke them. Yeah. What's
crazy bitch? Yeah, it,

273
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,190
that's a good old fashioned miscue mean.
That's a three's company.

274
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:32,340
Miscommunication. She's managing
city fucking her. I think she,

275
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,530
I sh I don't, you can't like rape
titty. Fuck somebody. Yes you can.

276
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,950
Yes you can. If you have a strong
mouth, they let you to the fuck.

277
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm just so that you'll get off him.
A lot of people that would do that.

278
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,520
What would that be? That would be
bloody though. She broke his dick.

279
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,320
She'd squeezed the wrong,
something happened. It's all
wrong. It's this, she, she's,

280
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,420
she was supposed to push
her tits together. Let's ups
terrible miscommunication.

281
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:59,120
That's at three's company
style. Miscommunicate come
and knock on their door.

282
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,970
That is a squeezing together.
I thought you meant something else.

283
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:04,100
Although he then went to the nurse,

284
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,110
then he went to the doctor the next
day and she rubbed at like Mri Jelly or

285
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,590
whatever, the uh, cat scan
jelly on his dick. And he said,

286
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:14,900
that's one of the best sexual
experiences he's ever had in his life.

287
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,840
What's always cold. I would imagine that
would feel really good on your Dick.

288
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,370
Yeah. Wow. And what did, what happened
when the cat scan is Dick? I think he,

289
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,710
I think he just had to not use it for a
bit. Imagine if the girl was Cass County,

290
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:29,360
his Dick, and she's watched, she's
doing it just going like God damn

291
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,160
dear penthouse times.

292
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,220
Has anybody ever gone to the doctor and
started getting the Dick cat scan and

293
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:39,950
then just start fucking the
doctor? You know, that's happened.

294
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,730
I know a guy who, who, uh,

295
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,820
was staying at the four seasons and fuck
the made Mike favor men fucked a maid.

296
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,810
I mean, he told us that story
favor men fucked and he's such,

297
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,180
wasn't even attractive. But she walked in
on him jerking off and she was like, oh,

298
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,800
sorry. He's like, shut the door. Come
on in, shut the door, hold on it.

299
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,600
And he said that he didn't even talk.
They just started banging. You don't,

300
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,740
you're not famous video of the guy that
sets up his laptop and then I records

301
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:11,600
maid's coming in while he's jacking off.
So like just wait. Yeah, explain that.

302
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:15,950
Say that like we know the thing that you
watch every day before you do anything.

303
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,880
There's this hilarious guy and you could
find that he fucked.com is one of the

304
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,300
websites that has it and it's just this
guy that puts this laptop here and he

305
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:26,750
puts headphones on. He just waits for
the maid. And then when she comes in,

306
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,440
he records like him jerking off and he,

307
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,570
has he been looking at her or
was he looking at his screen?

308
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,760
I know he's just like,
you can't see his face.

309
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,670
You just see it's from his Dick
[inaudible] the front door.

310
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,450
So you're just like the maids
come in one after another,

311
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,940
one after another and they're like,
they all do different things.

312
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,470
Most of them were like,
oh my God. So sorry.

313
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,140
So I'm just sit there and
just slowly turn around it.

314
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,130
But his mission was to actually have
somebody like fuck him or give him a blow

315
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:56,010
job. He just released a second
one where it finally at the end,

316
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,360
I almost don't want to give it away.

317
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,080
I made does come up and just start staring
at it and then slowly walks up and he

318
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,740
goes, Oh, do you want this?
And, and he goes, yes I do.

319
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:09,540
And the guys starts sucking him off on
the video. No, it was a male may miss you.

320
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,400
I promise you the twist
is that there's a male may

321
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,060
no. Listen, I don't know if you know this,
but I used to be on fear factor. Right?

322
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,510
I know about reality TV
and I don't buy that.

323
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,140
Please watch the videos act.
I kinda watching guys talk a guy's Dick.

324
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,880
I know what you're doing. What you're
doing is trying to trick me trying to,

325
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,330
you're trying to convert us bro.

326
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,510
You know you don't know me as well as
you think you know me. I'm not that dumb.

327
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,560
Okay.
How dare you.

328
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Well if trying to trick me to have like
500 other videos of women turning them

329
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,920
down over and over and over
again, and then he, I would not,

330
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,340
I would be on your boat to thinking it
was fake. But it's, he's been doing this.

331
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,520
I've known if I put that

332
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,730
[inaudible] is the one of
the worst detectives in the
history of Scotland Yard.

333
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,970
The police, he's following bad
leads. Gosh, really? He said, yeah.

334
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,430
Inspector Crusoe. His first video
came out like three to five years ago.

335
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,930
Then he's gotta be true
close, your honor. Yeah.

336
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,990
There's no need to further investigate.
We've got this one locked up. Uh,

337
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,440
I don't pull it up. Nobody wants to,
I don't want to watch God blow a guy.

338
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,320
I'm proud to say I was on one
of these sites. You have a day,

339
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,840
and I don't know if
anybody else does this,

340
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,910
where you'll PDR periodically check
in to make sure you're not gay.

341
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,580
Watch 15 seconds of male porn and
just go like, nope, still not good.

342
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,630
I'm still, as of last week, I'm still
not good. I think I'm out of the woods.

343
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,000
You know.
I think I'm officially out of the woods.

344
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,330
You remember the old Kinison bit
about that? It was a, he's like a,

345
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:36,550
they say every band's kind
of homosexual fantasy.

346
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,020
So I'm sitting around the house the other
day going over my fantasies because if

347
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:45,340
there's one in there I want to know.
I want to fucking know.

348
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,930
Yeah. I didn't like the idea of a guy
there was, I think he got was blown.

349
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,050
Another guy. Stubble. That's
what Bob just like stubble.

350
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,110
There's a lot that she bought it.
I don't want stubble anywhere near

351
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,130
precious. Well, men are crazy
and they're violent. And uh,

352
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,910
there were also that way if they're gay,
straight man,

353
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,430
crazy and violent and straight
straight men and gay men. They're,

354
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:10,710
the only difference is one
of them likes boys. Okay.

355
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:15,040
So the idea of that being
hot and sexy, uh, uh,

356
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,450
it's like getting blown by crazy
chimp. You know, I don't trust dudes.

357
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,380
Some Studley muscular dude
who suck on my deck. It's,

358
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,540
I can just rip it off and
throw it away and go, ha ha ha.

359
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,920
I like how you went a little crazy
on a big muscular guy going, hey,

360
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,540
fucking Harry perfectly Harry chess.
Perfectly Harry. Not Too much.

361
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:37,440
It's trims it a to grow out a little, but
it doesn't get, it doesn't get unkempt.

362
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,240
Yeah, they, they're having a good time
over there. I got to say the case. Yeah.

363
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,480
The gays have a weird life because
if it wasn't for the persecution,

364
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,980
it's pretty God damn sweet.
If you think about it,

365
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,560
like if we all men and women,
okay.

366
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,610
And this is coming from a guy who has
kids and loves having kids. However,

367
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,210
there's a weirdness to having sex with
men and women because it can possibly

368
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:01,930
result in a child. That weirdness
is eliminated with gay people.

369
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,590
It's just fucking,
and there's no Yang.

370
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,210
It's all Yin or Yang. No Yen, one of
those, whichever it is a hard one.

371
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,910
There's that.

372
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,420
Well, there is a bit of a Yin Yang in
them. There's, there's a little bit of,

373
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,710
there's a bottom top issue.

374
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,081
Yeah.

375
00:21:16,081 --> 00:21:19,800
But there's what the issue isn't what
a man wants versus what a woman wants.

376
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:20,970
They're both men.

377
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,870
So the weirdness like the
trying to figure out women,

378
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,010
especially like when you're young,

379
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:29,430
one of the weirdest things is just the
idea of trying to think the way a woman

380
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:32,670
thing. You think the way that guy thinks
you think everything's going to be fine.

381
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,290
And like I remember when I was young and
I just started dating when I was like a

382
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:37,801
teenager.

383
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:40,890
I would talk to girls the way I would
talk to my friends and they would get

384
00:21:40,891 --> 00:21:44,040
upset and they would think
you're crazy and can't do it.

385
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,820
You cannot change your language
completely. Change your language,

386
00:21:47,821 --> 00:21:51,390
change your approach, change the way you
guys can fuck around with each other.

387
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:54,690
And we assume that we're gonna like laugh
and fuck around with each other back.

388
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,820
And that's what we did.
We insult each other

389
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,750
halfass constantly day.

390
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:02,300
Do you know that there's a generation
though of girls now that are like Paul

391
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:06,640
busty and but it's the worst because a,
they're not good at it.

392
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,270
That was me. They're actually ball
busting and seed. You can't hit them back.

393
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,290
So you just have to go like,
yeah, it's crazy. That was stupid.

394
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,200
My shirt was stupid and you
can't go like, hey, by the way,

395
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:21,560
I could eviscerate you at any point.
I could have you crying and five seconds.

396
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,840
But if they're good at it,
see if they're good at it,

397
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:26,720
then it doesn't matter if they're a man
or a woman, it becomes irrelevant. Like,

398
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,410
okay, who's, who's really good at it?
Christina Palicki is a great ball buster.

399
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:33,740
She's all, I believe that she's
Hilarious, but she's good at it.

400
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,070
You know what I mean? And she's also, she
doesn't do it when it's not necessary.

401
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,910
Right. You know, she'll jump in when you
know, when she thinks something's funny.

402
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:42,230
He's going on just like a comic.

403
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,790
She's just a person that happens to be
funny and that's when you should be able

404
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:48,890
to ball bus when you're a person.
That's actually funny.

405
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,230
The worst is when you're
getting ballbuster by someone
who's not funny. Yeah.

406
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,180
Then it's not ball busting. It's just
you insulting me and pretending it to do

407
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,830
Joe. Yeah, exactly. And it's not, it's
not that funny, but I'm pretending.

408
00:22:58,831 --> 00:23:02,700
It's funny because I would like to have
sex with you in the next couple hours.

409
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,730
Good at going over.
All the things are ridiculous about me,

410
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:09,760
so if you say something ridiculous
amount being or stupid that I've done,

411
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,130
I will fucking laugh with.

412
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,270
Oh, I think it's important to
do and it's fun. Yeah. I just,

413
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,210
I think the best,

414
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:19,460
that's one of my favorite parts
about being friends with comedians.

415
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:20,630
It's like you're,

416
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,550
I'm getting made fun of on the highest
fucking level and it's a real pleasure.

417
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,220
It's fun. Yeah. It's fun.
Like, what are you? Perfect.

418
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,090
Perfect. Come on. You're an idiot.
I'm an idiot. We're all idiots.

419
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,150
Were all skating through
this fucking Weirdo life.

420
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't get so uptight about it.

421
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,550
But there's a big difference between
that when someone's just being funny and

422
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,070
someone's like, just
insulting you. You know,

423
00:23:42,071 --> 00:23:45,470
they didn't just think it's funny to make
fun of you in some way that's not even

424
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:48,500
humorous. You know? Like, this is weird.
You know? Like what's going on here?

425
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,600
I'm talking about girls that
took a class at UCB or something.

426
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,520
I'll look like an Improv class. I'm going
to turn some about classes. Go ahead.

427
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,920
They don't work.
Um,

428
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,900
I know that they have worked for stand
up a couple of people who's worked,

429
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,500
the standups that were in the phonies,
they began with out how to do comedy,

430
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,850
right?
They figured out how to do comedy,

431
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:09,230
but you're not going to
figure it out from a class.

432
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,850
What the class does do is it gives you
an opportunity to focus on it and go on

433
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:16,760
stage and do the material and fuck around.

434
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:20,120
But that guy can't teach her how to do
college. Oh No. But he can give me an a,

435
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:22,730
he can force your hand. He
can get you to do it. He can,

436
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,960
he can put you in front of people,

437
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:27,140
but when they start judging you
take it all with a grand salt.

438
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,810
Take it all with a grain of salt because
you might just figure out how to do it

439
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:32,270
that way.
If people had caught like say Joey Diaz,

440
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:36,710
perfect example back when Joey Diaz was
floundering like in the late nineties

441
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,470
and he wasn't doing that well on stage.

442
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:43,220
Like if people have seen Joey now
he's a destroyer. He's a monster.

443
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,590
But back then he wasn't,
he just hadn't figured it out yet.

444
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,610
What was he doing back then was he was
concerned about other people's opinions.

445
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,880
He wasn't nervous. He didn't feel like
he belonged there. I didn't feel like,

446
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,310
and he gave up one day,
he's a fuck this.

447
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:59,960
He just somehow or another figured out
how to just be himself on stage. You know,

448
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,080
you've met him, Brian, you, when you met
him, he was already funny. Yeah. Right.

449
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,600
You met him. He was already Joey
Diaz. Right. But before that,

450
00:25:05,601 --> 00:25:08,790
like in the late nineties he
said he was much thinner too.

451
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,970
Was it what he was using and not
use? It could be. It could be.

452
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,880
He just stopped giving a fuck. You know,
the thing, there was a lot going on,

453
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:20,120
you know? He was also is much more
troubled back then. He just, you know,

454
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:23,870
I had to come into his own, you know,
as a man, as a comedian, all the above.

455
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,280
But if you gave me advice
back then, that's my point
when he was bombing. Right.

456
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,800
You would, you wouldn't get it.
You would be wrong. You know,

457
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,800
if you told them you're being
too offensive, you're too rude.

458
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:37,760
What you're saying is not funny. It
makes people uncomfortable. Wrong.

459
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,910
He just needed to figure out how to
do it right. So if you watch him now,

460
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:43,100
he talks about the exact same shit.
I mean,

461
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,130
Joey Diaz essentially talks
about the exact same shit.

462
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:50,270
He's always talked about girls assholes.
This guy's a pussy.

463
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,100
Shut your mouth. Suck my
Dick. You know? I mean,

464
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,550
it's just him talking mad shit in
the most hilarious way possible.

465
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,520
And he always did that. It just, it
didn't, hadn't figured it out yet.

466
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,370
Has anyone ever given you good standup
advice? Comics have? Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,130
Comics have given me very good advice.

468
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,180
Can you think of the best that's advice
I ever got is don't say fuck too much.

469
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,090
They say, fuck too much.
You, you over. Fuck.

470
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,240
You use out the word where
it doesn't mean anything.

471
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,050
And it also makes you look like
you're a dummy and what people,

472
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,780
what it is is a lot of times it's a
substitution for the word, uh, for,

473
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,530
for um,
uh,

474
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,680
instead of saying now you say it's
fucking guy with his fucking hair flowing

475
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:35,300
like fucking Fabio. You know, it's
what you're doing is just doing slots.

476
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:37,520
Also impossible to know if the joke works.

477
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:39,920
If you say fucking in
it me the first time,

478
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:42,860
if you're trying to joke out and
then you're like, I'd rather not say,

479
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,110
and then you get on

480
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,550
stage and you're about to do the
punchline and you're like, you know what,

481
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,010
let me throw in a fuck
here just to be safe.

482
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,590
You should never do that.
But flux when their,

483
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,690
when they belong are crucial because if
you don't say fuck there and I know you

484
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:59,450
say fuck some times I'm,
I'm missing something.

485
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,680
You can either use fuck or never used.
Fuck. You can either Jim Gaffigan,

486
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:07,160
Brian Regan it where there's no fucks,
no fucks used.

487
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,050
Or you can drop d as an
interesting theory. Yeah.

488
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,630
Everyone's funny or clean.
That's theory sucks.

489
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,580
Oh absolutely. Here's
his here. He says, okay.

490
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,930
Obviously Bill Cosby,

491
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,800
but he says he's the only guy
who was actually funny or dirty.

492
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,280
Again, his theory, it's reading. What's,
what's Eddie's most memorable? But

493
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,310
Eddie who? Murphy Ice
Cream? Um, well it depends.

494
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,680
Ice Cream. I mean it's probably ice
cream. He fucking you in the ass.

495
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,880
I don't know about that. I
think it's nice car. Yeah.

496
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,340
You literally just looked for
to hit downloads on Youtube.

497
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:48,080
I think ice cream would be higher.

498
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,500
I think the barbecue would be hires
honeymooners getting fucked in the ass.

499
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,700
I've been looking at you and I know that,
you know,

500
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,360
and I want to fuck you in the
ass. Horrible bit. That was a war.

501
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:01,930
It was a cartoon or sleep bad,

502
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:05,480
but that's a bit that I bet he
would disavow today. Yeah. But no,

503
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:10,410
because he's really good at impressions,
but he does. It's a Shitty, like what are,

504
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,670
they fucked each other in the eyes.
It's like, wow, how you think of that.

505
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,410
But in the context of the series of
bits that he was doing about gay people,

506
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,910
he did it early in his actor.

507
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:22,850
That's what he did it like in the
first 15 minutes of that special.

508
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:25,610
It's kind of like you're doing eight,
I'm going to fuck you in the ass.

509
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,710
Well, I'll tell you, man, when I watched
that special, I was in high school,

510
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,830
I was in Newton and it was me and my
buddy Jimmy lawless and John Badaracco and

511
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,190
John's sister was the only girl there
was a real fucking buzz kill because we

512
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,850
felt bad about laughing at some of this
stuff. But we were crying, laughing,

513
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,450
crying, laughing is the first time I'd
ever seen Eddie Murphy Raw. I was like,

514
00:28:45,451 --> 00:28:48,660
God damn, that was
funny. Or not delirious.

515
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,520
Rod Ron wasn't quite as good. I don't, I
don't feel, I feel like delirious was the

516
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,790
[inaudible] wasn't quite as good,
but they both, I think that,

517
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,300
I think the lyrics has the, the barbecue,
which is an amazing bit. Oh yeah.

518
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,310
And someone pointed out to me when he's
finished, so one of the audience yells,

519
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:09,230
do what again,
good side for a bit.

520
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,030
That's hilarious. And Ice Cream,
ice cream and the barbecue.

521
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:16,970
I had both thought so I would, so that's
rocks theory that every and Chapin,

522
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,630
he would say Chappelle's best bid
is like baby on the corner. Um,

523
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:25,270
Chappelle's best bit is about this to be
the creation of AIDS. I totally agree.

524
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,430
I always say,
I always say Chappelle.

525
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:31,850
He's the only person on earth
who would side with the monkey

526
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,151
I saw.

527
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:38,660
So it's a really funny bit because
like you have a try to fuck a monkey

528
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,000
will be to to fuck.
I'm like

529
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:47,610
no, exactly. Monkeys or people
you don't, you don't fuck month.

530
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,470
You don't feel like I'm a
stay home tonight and the
stigma and bubbles is fixing

531
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:51,860
to give me a foot job or what?

532
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,330
I wonder if anybody has ever really fucked
a live monkey mean you'd have to kill

533
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,020
it to get the fuck up.
I think you,

534
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,020
well you maybe just give
it some wine or something.

535
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,280
You got to club it over their head.

536
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,890
There's no other way a monkey's going to
let you fuck it. They're going to rip.

537
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,630
You don't think so?
I don't think so.

538
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,930
Like I would just like a
fucking little shoulder Magee.

539
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,460
If you have a little shoulder monkey,

540
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,230
imagine how big your Dick
Looks to that monkey.

541
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:14,630
Even if you have it just a
mediocre Dick. Right? Okay.

542
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,370
Your Dick is bigger than it's fucking
legs. I mean that's a tiny little animal.

543
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,180
You're not going to stick your
Dick and it's, but that's true.

544
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,050
What if you're like an Asian
guy? Honestly, hey on Daria.

545
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,050
I don't know if that's true or not true
cause I don't go around looking at dicks.

546
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,750
No, there's another big
thing you can do. The,

547
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,360
there's a thing where they have
average penis size by by country. Yeah.

548
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,180
I think they didn't check me.

549
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,880
They didn't check you for how do we know
if they're getting accurate readings?

550
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,410
The sample size.
Do not believe any fucking statistics.

551
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,970
I don't believe them.
I gave up,

552
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,080
I believe in the Internet
only I fuckin Wikipedia.

553
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,590
It's an odd Wikipedia. Um, yeah,

554
00:30:51,591 --> 00:30:55,160
so rocks theory is he's the only
guy who's funny, dirty prior.

555
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,930
His best fit would be mud
bone or the, the, the,

556
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:03,260
I think the Italian guys are the thing
that was on here. Any good jokes?

557
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,240
Look prior had a million bits that are
all amazing and epic and legendary and

558
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,020
they were great because he did
whatever he wanted to. Whether you,

559
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:13,640
if you want it to be cleaned as clean,
if you want it to be dirty, he was dirty.

560
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,850
I think the secret is be who you are.

561
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,990
There's the idea of clean or dirty. Well,
if you're talking about subject manner,

562
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,140
the idea of working clean is
ridiculous. Like what? What?

563
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:27,800
What is your life I haven't had
the lights have to do with you?

564
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:31,940
Life is taking a shit in. Life is eating
food. You life is getting into arguments.

565
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:36,050
Your life is having sex. Your life
is, your life is driving and traffic.

566
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:38,360
Your life is a bunch of
fucking things that go on.

567
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,760
And if you leave out the ones that
are weird or sexual, when you leave,

568
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,920
you're going to eliminate a
bunch of things. You can't talk.

569
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,110
I gotta say,
I'm not a big fan of poop jokes though,

570
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,360
as like a level of difficulty thing.

571
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,240
Let me tell you something. This
dude, I hear you, but a guy who's,

572
00:31:54,241 --> 00:31:56,190
this weekend it was with,
it was a hunting guide,

573
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,920
told me a story about an old man
shitting his pants and his car,

574
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,520
and it was one of the funniest fucking
stories I have heard in months.

575
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,960
It was a hilarious story about this crazy
old man that he had there that was on

576
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,810
this a hunting trip and
was fucking missing.

577
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:12,660
Everything is shooting and everything
and swearing, and it was just crazy.

578
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:17,220
Crotchy old man. I'm not
saying Shit, his pants. I mean,

579
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,390
I'm not doing this story any justice, but
this dude told Cody, told me the story.

580
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,160
By the way,
a thank you to the,

581
00:32:23,161 --> 00:32:26,100
to hone ranch or taking care of
me and Steve Rinella this weekend.

582
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,510
We had a great time.

583
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,020
If you in southern California and you've
ever thought about hunting and going

584
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:33,570
hunting with a guide, you've got
to go through all the requirements,

585
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:36,270
like getting your license and all
that stuff, but the, to hone ranch,

586
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,210
it's an hour outside of California
or an hour outside of La and

587
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,130
I've never seen a place like this.
It's fucking crazy.

588
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,330
W There's at least 50,000 pigs on
this ranch. We were wild pig hunting.

589
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,250
Pigs are everywhere. Fucking
monster, 400 pound bores. We saw elk,

590
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:55,880
they have Colorado Rocky mountain elk
there an hour and a half from La Dude,

591
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,150
an hour and a half from La. I'll show you
the pictures of the place. It's insane.

592
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,910
You would never believe that
this is in southern California.

593
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,620
I mean it's like essentially closer then
to us than San Diego is and it's the

594
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:10,400
fucking wilderness.
We saw dozens of coyotes.

595
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:14,730
We saw at least 50 deer. We saw at
least a hundred pigs wandering around.

596
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:18,110
Homeless Guy, right? No,
no, no, no homeless guys.

597
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:20,510
They don't allow you to do that anymore.
In the 70s.

598
00:33:20,511 --> 00:33:24,850
They pass regulations protecting the
homeless from hunters. But it's a, if,

599
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,610
if you want to go on a guided hunt and
if you want to be close to cal southern

600
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:31,070
California,
you can't do better to hone ranch,

601
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:34,320
tee Jio and ranch fucking great place.
And uh,

602
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,100
they took care of me and Steve Rinella
big time was really, really fun.

603
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,220
You stay on the ground. So yeah,
they have, they have a cabin there.

604
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:44,270
You stay at the lodge. They have
TV. You Watch TV, food, you know,

605
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:47,630
and it's a nice little place. Would
you kill, kill the big fat pig?

606
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,830
I'll show you a picture of Oculus
wild pig. What kind of gun? Uh,

607
00:33:51,831 --> 00:33:56,780
I used a 300 wind mag.
It's a rifle. That's a pig.

608
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:00,800
That's me. No one wants to see it
clean. It looks like a little, uh, yeah.

609
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:06,350
[inaudible] was a great example. I totally
agree. I, it's not a perfect theory.

610
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:08,900
He's saying like top 10 of all time,

611
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,960
the People's best bits are clean.

612
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,250
Whatever nonsense this is,
I,

613
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:20,251
I just think whenever you say this
is always that in stand up comedy,

614
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,370
it's very hard to do that
because we'll rock and sign.

615
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:26,980
Fuck you say no one tan
is funny and no one,

616
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,510
no one in good shape.
It's funny.

617
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,570
I've heard that one before and that
one made me insecure when I was first

618
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,590
starting. I used to wear baggy clothes
to hide my fucking sexy. Oh fuck.

619
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,760
I didn't, you know, it looked like a
jock. I look like a Douche bag. I know it,

620
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,060
but that's what I looked like, man,
I can't do anything about that.

621
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,460
Don't be all fucking generalizing.
Well,

622
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:49,290
that's how I feel sometimes
where it's like, yes, sorry.
I have five brothers. I'm,

623
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,710
I'm fucking, I'm jockey. Yeah.

624
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,490
My favorite example of you can't tell
somebody what's funny and what's not.

625
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,660
You can't is Mitch Hedberg,

626
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,960
who was one of my favorite all
time comedians and squeaky clean.

627
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,270
There's just never barely ever talked
about sex. If I can remember, I mean,

628
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:08,030
might've had one or two jokes here or
there, but mostly it was really hilarious,

629
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:11,240
silly observations.
That was his whole act and in a weird,

630
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:15,220
weird way that nobody would ever t tell
you you should do no one who would ever

631
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,160
teach her how to do it. Oh yeah. The
best comics are like, that's what I said.

632
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:23,860
The top 10 comics at the top
hundred comics haven't gone
to a comedy class. Yeah.

633
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,280
The, I once said, the bottom hundred
may have, but you know what, man,

634
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:32,120
you know you could be a great comic
one day and go to a comedy class.

635
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,420
It doesn't disclude you from, is that
a word? Thanks. Click word. Yeah.

636
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,380
Disclude that I make that up. I think
that's better. I think that's valid.

637
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,980
The next clue. Fuck. Then it's settled.
You know? Disclude sounds better.

638
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,640
It seems like a good word.
See you put that in the urban dictionary

639
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,410
along with Shiela bouffed.
That's the Newman. Sia.

640
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,010
Shiela. Charlotte bouffed.
Yeah. What's that?

641
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,670
You got in a bar fight again at the same
bar that he got in a fight like last

642
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,270
year. Well, he's a rough, tough guy.
He's a rough and tumble character.

643
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,150
You know when you're around him,
he's, he's kind of a pirate.

644
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,450
He's ready to ready to steal your
material and he's ready to punch you.

645
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,000
I think that keeps his bipolar,
by the way.

646
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,870
I'm sure there's something really
wrong with him. He's an actor. Yeah.

647
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,540
There's this, 90% of them
are broken, broken people.

648
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,810
There's something wrong with them. Of
course. Here it's fucking crazy. The Guy,

649
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,720
we saw the psychopath thing, the comics
are all psychopaths. Yeah. Oh, for sure.

650
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,490
Yeah.
Joey Dee is a hundred percent psychopath.

651
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,390
That's why he's the funniest guy on
earth. Yeah. I have no problem going like,

652
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,630
yeah, of course you can't. Our
brains are scrambled. Yeah,

653
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,520
but it doesn't mean you're
going to act on those impulses

654
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,840
is you know people have wild and impulses
all the time that you don't act on it.

655
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,360
Just your brain thinks in weird
ways and you can sort of a use that,

656
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,180
that valve and turn that
valve on the comedy.

657
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,070
I also think we want to be liked too
much to murder somebody. That's not true.

658
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,680
Yeah. After you get over that,
after the show, a bunch of,

659
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,130
you don't need that many people like you.
I get it,

660
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:03,060
but I'm saying like if you kill somebody,
you know it's going to,

661
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,790
your numbers are going to drop
on the road while you will.

662
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,800
If you kill somebody for your free.
Sure. Excluding them forever for being a,

663
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,840
from being from, yeah, from killing
onto your website can be a fan.

664
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:16,080
They're not going to join your mailing
list. I'm on following you on Twitter.

665
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,990
Oh my God. When I beat this guy to death,
he's never coming back to my Twitter.

666
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,590
Yeah. Yeah. Good point. Thank you.

667
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,840
I know how you think you think ahead.

668
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,460
I would never have a number of things
that I think it was think ahead.

669
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,300
You plan a couple of stature,
a couple of steps ahead. Yeah.

670
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:32,690
You've got to plan for the future when
it comes to beat someone to death. Yeah,

671
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,240
I'm fucking, you don't have that
Irish fucking vengeance thing,

672
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:39,690
huh?

673
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,471
No,
I,

674
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:45,060
well if I did when I was young
I eliminated it at all with

675
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,230
thinking and you know,

676
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,510
do you won't treat it as I've argued.
Do you argue with people in your head?

677
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,450
I don't allow myself to do an immune
that anymore. I used to do that.

678
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,600
I used to do that when I was a young
man. I used to, if I was a young man,

679
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,231
I got an argument.

680
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:04,231
Someone I would relive that argument like
everyday for like 10 minutes for like

681
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,510
a year. Maybe I'll come back to it a
year later. Yeah. It's fucking guy.

682
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:08,344
I should have told that fucker.

683
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,040
Well fuck you mister.
You have to like go through your notes.

684
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,320
Like what was I going to say to him?
Oh yeah. I was going to say that

685
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,320
I just talk about this on stage.
This is totally true. When I was a,

686
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,550
I guess I was like 26,
I live,

687
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,150
I was living in Encino and I rented this
house and it had an orange tree in the

688
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,850
front yard and I didn't pay my bills.
It's very irresponsible.

689
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,140
So this guy came over,
uh,

690
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,860
I had turned the power back on and the
guy came over to turn the power on and it

691
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:33,470
seemed like a nice guy. I said, hey
man, uh, those oranges and delicious,

692
00:38:33,471 --> 00:38:36,220
if you want one, go grab one.
And he goes, okay, thanks.

693
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,280
So the guy took nine fucking orange
and I sat there watching them like this

694
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,130
motherfucker, he's taken more
orange. I can't believe this shit.

695
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:50,080
And to this day, man, I have to fight
off the urge. No, no, no, no, no.

696
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:52,360
It's not that story like
three times. It, it's real.

697
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,160
Like I was an asshole for to this day
I'll be in my car and I'm driving down the

698
00:38:57,161 --> 00:39:00,580
street and I'll just go nine
fucking orange is really,

699
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,670
that was 1993 did I tell you the
story that the alone told me?

700
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,100
But I tell it on this podcast,
no. Shit. Like this never happens.

701
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,520
Me

702
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,490
Heaven one time flew to,

703
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,580
we're going to fight to a Mayweather
fight and we get on the plane and fucking

704
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,020
Stallone is waiting

705
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,900
for us. I'm proud of, come on in. Hello.

706
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,640
All right. I guess we're going
to a fight with Stallone.

707
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,960
It's great thing about Stallone. He
knows what his good stories, ours. He,

708
00:39:32,961 --> 00:39:35,360
you know what I mean? He like knows
what people want to hear about.

709
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:37,730
They want to hear about rocky.
They want to hear about fucking,

710
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:38,241
they want to hear it.

711
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:43,040
So he's talking about he was
directing the movie staying alive. Oh,

712
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,400
uh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah, he
was, and it was a Travolta movie that,

713
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,540
that Frank Stallone sang on the
soundtrack. That is correct. Um,

714
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,090
so yes.

715
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,800
So Stallone said that he,
he goes, he goes, so I,

716
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,800
I called John Up to the house for meeting

717
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,120
about that song, play that song. Why the
stories? He goes alone, this is the end,

718
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,690
I think it's called. This is
the end. And he staying alive.

719
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,790
He goes, he goes. So John came up and
he goes, John's got a real food issue.

720
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,260
People don't know that. And he
goes, he goes, John comes up,

721
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:21,000
we're sitting at the
table. And he goes, now,

722
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:25,710
my wife had made some
homemade fudge that day.

723
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,630
So we sit at the table,

724
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,870
my wife puts out some fudge Travolta
proceeds to eat the entire plate of food.

725
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,380
This fucking guy over,
man. He goes, he goes,

726
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,210
which first of all,
his fucking route,

727
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,290
which is fucking made me laugh my
head off. And that was like that.

728
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:49,180
He hasn't forgotten that he, that's
his orange story is that, is that, um,

729
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,170
is that it was fucking rude. That's still
owned or that a turmoil. Tate, all of us.

730
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,910
Well, he's hanging on to some shit
from the early eighties right?

731
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,120
One was staying alive.
That was the 82.

732
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,780
Remember when he's walking
down the streets in New
York City with a fucking fur

733
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:06,780
coat on and it got bumps into him.
Travolta bumps it on like so long.

734
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:08,310
You really remember this movie.

735
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:12,950
It's the wrong song. Is that
it? Yeah. What does it say?
It's called far from over.

736
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,540
Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is a great
fucking song. Okay. Change. Yeah.

737
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:21,970
This is
the loans,

738
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,330
the loans brother.

739
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,100
This fucking song was
the shit back in the day.

740
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,900
I wish I knew how to dance song.
I'm downloading this.

741
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm even fucking around and then say,

742
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,860
I forgot about this.
I wish I knew how to dance back then.

743
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,690
I want it to be a part of this world.

744
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,280
I wanted it to be the impressive guy on
the dance floor spinning around and in a

745
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,610
perfect position. It's still, oh,

746
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:47,810
he said that they were shooting
flashdance next door and he's like,

747
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:51,050
and we knew that that was going to
be the one John Travolta met a single

748
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:51,531
handedly,

749
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:56,420
made more men gay just from this music
and from singing and dancing and getting

750
00:41:56,421 --> 00:42:00,920
people to dance. He probably purse. That
was probably his total overall goal,

751
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,000
which is to say nothing of his bath house
work. Just ours, the Shaw's power work,

752
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:09,590
but just to be able to dance so good
and make dancing, fucking dancing.

753
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:13,680
It's not the Fred Astaire days. This is
a new era of manliness. We get frank.

754
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:18,140
You were, did you ever go to like a
disco or, yeah, I did that. Of course.

755
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,680
So how else do you want to get laid?
We want to just stand around with a sign.

756
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,990
Please fuck me.
And you fucking take it out there.

757
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,850
Neil Brandon out there and you did it,
dude.

758
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:30,170
I had Kava Ricci pants tight on the top
and they ballooned out like Mc Hammer.

759
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:33,560
PCO owes all that shit and I went on
stage with those ones. It was a disaster.

760
00:42:33,561 --> 00:42:37,040
Look at him, but he made dancing
a manly thing that was attractive.

761
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,060
This is one of the gangs things you
could see a man do ever look at that.

762
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:44,060
Back that up for two seconds that I want
to show you what those guys are getting

763
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,980
a hand job. You know what they're
doing. Know they're doing.

764
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,370
They're pretending they're near a
million dicks here. This shit you,

765
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,420
you suck at Youtube. Now
this youtube sucks. Does it?

766
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,440
Well, this is the, uh,

767
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,870
standard compilation that you had
to have in those old school movies.

768
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,880
You to have this series of scenes. We
could see him failing, failing, failing,

769
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,630
and then practicing really
hard and it's dancing. See,

770
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,310
he's waiting tables, but
when it gets out there, boom,

771
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,070
fuck doesn't waiver me. I use a phone.
I need the phone and everybody, what is

772
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,190
fucker is crazy. God Damn Mind.
Yes. You're going to get to be gay.

773
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,700
Come dance. Yes, I can dance. Fuck.

774
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,810
Look at this though. This movement.
Look at that thing with the toes.

775
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,340
Whenever you point your toes like that,
you're begging for decker literal. Yeah,

776
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,530
man. You're pointing your toes. A
cry for help. We were begging for it.

777
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,540
It's on the wrong with Pega for deck.
Don't get me wrong.

778
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,240
Nothing wrong with being gay. To,
to volt is a bad motherfucker.

779
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,560
Turn turned off for a drug off. Those
are decks. That's a hundred deck.

780
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,600
That is just gimme. Dik Dik Dik. Dik. Dik.

781
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:57,530
Dik Dik she'll be moving
your fist towards your face.

782
00:43:57,531 --> 00:43:58,790
He trying to hit yourself in the face.

783
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,350
It's clearly not an outward move where
the retraction is just bringing it back

784
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:07,790
to position. No, they're
pulling down. That's pulling
Dick's into your mouth. Yeah,

785
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:12,290
I told him, look, I totally like I saw
it. I saw it. Nothing wrong with that.

786
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:15,710
That's another testament to the,
to the gays are having a blessed yes,

787
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,070
they're having more fun for sure
George Michael and of having a blast.

788
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,760
You know what? The gains are not having
fun. The ones who fuck up and adopt kids,

789
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,680
they start thinking I'm going to be like
a family. We're going to get to that.

790
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,930
We're going to get married.
We got adopt kids.

791
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:31,931
And I'm like what does that a lot of
fucking work wise they had the key,

792
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,490
they were winning the race and nobody
had the baby out of their body.

793
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,301
Neither one of them.

794
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,430
So they're both standing there
with this little motherfucker.

795
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,380
It's causing all sorts of problems. Damn,
I fucked up the whole big gay party.

796
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,770
Is this another gate? What are you doing
here? Okay. Cause she's, she's acting,

797
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,090
she's talking about her baby.

798
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,070
Like you know how you were
just saying the Dixon mouth.

799
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:54,000
This is a news reporter saying how she
used to take her a electric toothbrush

800
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,060
and to help her kids gums, but she did
it on air and it just like completely

801
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,640
keep the music playing.

802
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,270
Look at her, look at it. That's to Dixie.

803
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:14,680
She's docking Dick's and then
she's tasting them. Yum. Yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum. Yum. Oh,

804
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:15,740
I'm going to sneeze on your Dick

805
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,510
as delicious.
Yeah.

806
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,750
It's funny that you're not supposed to
ever think of those people being sexual.

807
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:28,140
Like if she actually did do that and
start it with like, like code. Yeah.

808
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,440
I fucking believe this guy homeroom.

809
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,440
I think that's the fun,

810
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:35,670
one of the fun parts about having sex
with women is how different it is from

811
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:39,350
what they're normally like.
Cause you and I are eight or 10 seconds.

812
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:44,340
I can imagine you fucking within eight
seconds of right now someone wants to

813
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,470
fuck and he's really close to me.
I know what you're doing.

814
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,090
Whereas in girls got fucking
jewelry on and her decorum.

815
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,030
I see what you're in like.

816
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:55,230
And then the difference between like
a girl in real life and a girl getting

817
00:45:55,231 --> 00:46:00,231
fucked or fucking is so fast and
it's so awesome and so exciting.

818
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:06,550
You mean it really talking dirty and get
her fucking sweating and they fucking

819
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:11,320
legs or splits the best picture near
Brennan fucking now I can't help it.

820
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,590
You're so clever. I see what
you've done, both of you together.

821
00:46:15,591 --> 00:46:18,970
Should she get together and try
and find my demise man's videos.

822
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,940
One got together. He's got a heck of a
video. You should really check out Joe.

823
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:26,420
I'm going to get you to think about a guy
sucking a guy's Dick and I'm gonna get

824
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,300
you to watch it. And then you're like,
I want you to think about me having sex,

825
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:33,200
so I see what you both have
done. How dare you? How dare you.

826
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,440
Some comic was telling me that
today when he'd go on the road,

827
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,710
him and his buddies who were
staying at the hotel together,

828
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,520
they knew that they were going to try
to bring girls back to the hotel room

829
00:46:43,521 --> 00:46:47,660
afterward. Uh, and they wanted the
girls to not be wearing a lot of closer.

830
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,180
They would turn the heat
up as high as they can

831
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,220
in the hotel room. That's
weird. Is that how dumb girls

832
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,650
they'll get naked and next
thing I know we're fucking,

833
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,500
because you know how that goes.
When people get really hot and lethargic,

834
00:47:03,501 --> 00:47:06,530
that's when they're the best. They want
it can't stop thinking about the fucking,

835
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,930
when you're about to dehydrate,
you're about to black blackout.

836
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,310
That's when you really want to throw
down. Yeah. Just bring a lot of water.

837
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:14,630
Give them water and they'll fuck you.

838
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:19,310
Are you add and on me right now literally
wanting to check out right there.

839
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,110
That's what I'm saying. Don't do
that. Put that fucking phone man.

840
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:27,320
You can donate it. The flow of
the conversation is interrupted.

841
00:47:27,321 --> 00:47:29,980
If you let those fucks in your mind.
I thought you were. I felt like

842
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,850
the flow. I felt like you
were putting a dam up a damn.

843
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,120
I thought you were fucking
beavering conversation.

844
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,560
Don't want to think about you
fucking or I don't want this one.

845
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:42,130
Did walk through where the flow
was going. Joe, I got news for you.

846
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,510
That's where it was headed.
It was there already going there.

847
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,353
It was already there.

848
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,610
Brian's got videos of bears
making out for no reason

849
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:57,820
to own ranches. Bears too. They have
a fuck a little amount or killing? No,

850
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,520
he can't cannot them anymore.
Oh yeah, you can't actually,

851
00:47:59,521 --> 00:48:01,650
you can't hunt with dogs.
Can't have them outline.

852
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,310
So they let the mountain lions live.

853
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,790
People are all fucking bleeding
heart about the mountain lions.

854
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,270
Like they wanted to keep the
mountain lion population up. Okay.

855
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,620
You sure? Like why? Like there's a lot of
them, you know, she'll be really careful.

856
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,040
Too many. Oh yeah, for sure.
100% no doubt about it.

857
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,280
There's definitely too many mountain
lions. There's too many mountain lions.

858
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:23,020
There's too many wolves
in America as well.

859
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,140
But a California has a real mountain
line issue cause mountain lion hunting is

860
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:26,974
not legal.

861
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,090
So they're allowed to just keep reading
and keep [inaudible] just slaughtering

862
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:35,080
deer like crazy. And also like
house pets too. Oh yeah, definitely.

863
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:37,570
House pets and occasionally the
jogger when it was, you know,

864
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:40,690
a person you fuck up, they'll catch a
person slipping every couple of years.

865
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,700
And Jackie,
especially a woman or a child,

866
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:47,560
my lines are God damn dangerous and
California has a large population of them

867
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:48,880
and you can eat them too,
by the way,

868
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,280
but they won't let you hunt them
because people are all like,

869
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:55,240
oh the majestic cat, but a beautiful
creek and they are cool as fuck to see.

870
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,160
But you can't let them get out of hand,
man.

871
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,280
You can't with the populations get
out of hand. That is real shit.

872
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:05,200
This is all chitter chatter and
it's all just nice and cool to talk.

873
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,670
And we're sitting in this air conditioned
room in the valley and we know we have

874
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:14,230
a computer in front of us. When you
are out there, if you are in the woods,

875
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:17,380
well you shouldn't be in the woods.
That's their world. The fuck it is.

876
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,360
This whole plan. It's our world. Okay.

877
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,780
And anywhere where people
live human to human beings,

878
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,700
this is teen people, my
friend, we own this planet.

879
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,740
It doesn't mean you should
be a con killed dolphins.

880
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,070
But what I'm saying is if you're walking
through the woods, beautiful woods,

881
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:35,350
and you'd like to enjoy it,
but a mountain lion wants to eat you,

882
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,870
that mountain line can go fuck itself.
That's what I think.

883
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:41,140
I think we should kill a certain
amount of them and make sure that their

884
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:43,180
populations are in the point
of killing deer. Right?

885
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:47,050
It's like you can kill deer because
there's so fucking many of them.

886
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:52,051
Do your pose a threat only in the sense
that they carry diseases like you can

887
00:49:52,151 --> 00:49:56,920
get, um, a lot of deer ticks and Lyme
disease, Lyme disease, you can get that.

888
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,400
People get that and it's absolutely
devastating. But that's sort of like,

889
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:04,810
that's not their fault. And they also
carry the risk of auto accidents.

890
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:07,640
A huge issue in places
that have like farmland,

891
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:10,780
like they're killing deers
all the time in those places.

892
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:14,200
And you're talking about massive
damage to your car and you could die.

893
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:18,040
Like many people have died hitting a deer.
The deer goes through the windshield.

894
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,700
You get gored with its antlers,
you get kicked to death. Yeah,

895
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,140
100% that has absolutely happened.

896
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,920
But the mountain line thing is they'll
hunt you. I mean they really will.

897
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:30,620
If you're hiking and you're
alone and you have a lamp,

898
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,610
you twisted your ankle and you don't have
a gun and you're wanting this mountain,

899
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:38,270
mine sees you limping and it's hungry.
Especially if it's an old cat.

900
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,510
It really can't catch dear
anymore. You're fucked. All right.

901
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:43,100
And I don't think that
that should be the case.

902
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:47,000
I heard that that's how they catch.
You can't kill one in self defense.

903
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,120
You might be able to get away with
it if you kill it and self defense.

904
00:50:50,121 --> 00:50:54,470
But my point is that malicious,
the population be should
be kept under control.

905
00:50:54,471 --> 00:50:58,020
They have a good census of how
many animals exist and the,

906
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,130
the numbers are very high
and they can hunt them.

907
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,470
So the numbers are going
to continue to go up.

908
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,330
And once something becomes illegal,

909
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:08,990
which I believe it became in 91 they
made mountain lion hunting and legal,

910
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:11,300
it's very difficult to turn that
around and do it the other way.

911
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,340
But in most states that
have mountain lions,

912
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,520
they have mountain lion hunting and they
have a season on mountain lions and it

913
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:20,810
is just to keep their populations
healthy and in check and not make them

914
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,500
dangerous.

915
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:25,270
There's no concern about mountain lions
going extinct like anybody thinks there

916
00:51:25,271 --> 00:51:25,511
is,

917
00:51:25,511 --> 00:51:30,440
is totally missing the misunderstanding
what's going on or just completely

918
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,510
incorrect. They're there.
They're dangerous, man. Where's
this one? Sun Valley? Yeah.

919
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,170
Okay. How big are they? Well,
they can get to be 150 pounds.

920
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,380
I've seen too in my life and they were
both maybe like 60 the first one was

921
00:51:44,631 --> 00:51:47,240
probably like 60 pounds and the
second one got your dog or something.

922
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,900
That was about 60 pounds.
It wasn't a big cat. Yeah.

923
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,650
Video killed this dog or is that
supposedly killed this dog? Of course.

924
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:58,790
Don't they do a thing where they lower
the dogs in? No, that's files. Coyotes.

925
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,450
I lie. I got to say I respect the
coyotes for that. They're gangster. Yeah,

926
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,820
they're very clever. Those
sneaky fell act, they'll,

927
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,850
they'll act like they let the dog into
their pack and then they just eventually

928
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:12,860
get like, oh no, we're going
to eat. We tricked you.

929
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:17,980
Well what they do is one get one coyote
will show itself and bark or make noises

930
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,890
and try to get the dog to chase it.
And then if the dog chases it,

931
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,540
it'll chase it into an ambush and the
other counts, and that's super common.

932
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,150
They also like a female coyote that's in,
in heat.

933
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,750
She'll show herself in that for the same
reason to get males because they know

934
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:37,340
that male dogs will come after them
and they just set them up. Lira trap.

935
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,620
There was a guy who
worked at my pet store,

936
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:43,070
I think I've told this story before
on the podcast, but he, uh, had a dog,

937
00:52:43,071 --> 00:52:44,720
he was working at the
veterinarian's assistant,

938
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:48,410
have dog come in really big pit
Polak hundred 20 pound pit bull,

939
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:51,110
one of those crazy ones that they breed,
like land of the giants.

940
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:52,820
You ever heard of that breeding company?

941
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,420
The pip pit bulls traditionally
used to be about 35 pounds.

942
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:59,510
Then they started making them bigger,
especially for like boar hunting.

943
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:03,230
Like I used to have a boar hunting dog.
He's about 90 pounds is a big pit bull.

944
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,610
This one was way bigger than that. It's
120 pound dog. Okay. And it's covering,

945
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:10,490
it looks like a pit bull.
It's just huge to giant monster.

946
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,800
What are they breed it with? Well they
just breed them for size. They take,

947
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,300
it's still pit balls, but they just take,
some of them don't. Some of them breed,

948
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,720
they'd be, they create what they
call a Bam dog, which is a breed,

949
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:22,550
a pit bull with a mastiff and
try to get a larger pit bull.

950
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,450
I actually have one of those now. There's
the sweetest dogs in the world. Yeah, no,

951
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,830
I have a pit bull. He's the
best. But I mean this one's not,

952
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:33,120
I mean he has no dog aggression. He's
math massive and they bred it. The guy a,

953
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,110
it's called a regency mastiff. And
what it is is the guy, his dad,

954
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:40,260
curly was actually on fear
factor and his dad was a,

955
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:43,090
they put people in the suits and they
would sic the dog out on the dog,

956
00:53:43,091 --> 00:53:44,790
would grab him, boom.
Slammed to the ground.

957
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:48,120
I think there's a video of
curly from fearful. That was
early fear factor, right?

958
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,770
No,
don't know the first episode ever.

959
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:53,100
We use Belgian malinois and they're
really small dogs. They're, you know,

960
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,460
there may be like 60 pounds impressed
that. I know my fear factor episodes.

961
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:58,960
Do you know it probably better than
me. I was stoned the whole time. Yeah.

962
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:01,260
But this, um, the early days,

963
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,660
the Belgium al wants the
problem is the really big guys.

964
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:06,330
Like we had my friend Pete,
Pete, the cop, and Chicago,

965
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:10,010
maybe I'll see you this weekend.
Pete, uh, peed, uh, the,

966
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:13,290
the dog bit him and he just fucking
ran with that dog. He's like, bitch,

967
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,980
he likes dogs only like 60
pounds. But I, in my head,

968
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:21,210
I feel like I could beat him six pounds,
that Doug will eat your asshole.

969
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,530
But if you're in one of those big suits,
like here, you can see it. See, this is a,

970
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,530
this is a Belgian malinois stow.
These are the smaller dogs.

971
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,710
And it took this young girl down,
but this girl was, you know,

972
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:35,910
probably about 110 pounds at the most.
But my friend Pete is about,

973
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,950
he's back there with the dark hair,

974
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,370
big studly copies of boxer and yeah,

975
00:54:41,371 --> 00:54:46,371
he's about to 20 solid all American male
and that dog bit a hold of him and he

976
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:52,110
just ran with it. Here's my buddy
Pete. Um, but that's not the dog look,

977
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,280
look up curly curly is,
uh,

978
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,470
my dog's name is Johnny Cash and
curlies Johnny Cash, his dad.

979
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,760
Best dog I've ever had. That wasn't
the same episode though, right? No,

980
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,490
totally different episodes. But this
dog is the best dog I've ever had.

981
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:06,330
He's so sweet.

982
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:10,500
He's just sweet and smart and he's just
cool and chilled out and it's the best.

983
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,400
Yeah, he's awesome. But anyway, this
dog was about Johnny side. My dog,

984
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:17,880
Johnny is about a buck 40. This dog
was close, like a buck 20 comes back,

985
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,960
a pit bull covered and
cuts his fucking stay.

986
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,580
Thousand stitches literally all
over his body. And they're like,

987
00:55:23,581 --> 00:55:26,820
what happened to your dog? He's like, I
don't know. I came home, eat something at,

988
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,100
obviously attacked him.
You know,

989
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,730
they thought it was a cat
or something like that. They
follow a blood trail. Okay.

990
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,170
From where this fucking dog,
I mean,

991
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,910
severe cuts all over this dog's body go
up into the hills where they find nine

992
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:43,800
dead coyotes. Wow. Looked like a scene
from fucking saving private Ryan.

993
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,060
Look at this, uh, like, here's
a, that's a different dog.

994
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:52,110
But that's also a big strong dog. That's
a, that's an American bulldog that, uh,

995
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,670
Joe, the guy who was the
trainer, um, also had,

996
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:01,350
but curly was this mother fucker,
this giant black mastiff.

997
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,510
Anyway, this, uh, this guy, they found
what happened with those dogs was that,

998
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,170
you know,

999
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:11,090
this group of coyotes had been doing
that on a consistent basis and there's

1000
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,270
several dogs in the neighborhood had
gotten killed and it just set the trap for

1001
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:19,320
the wrong dog. So awesome. This
dog slaughtered nine coyotes.

1002
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:22,830
He said it was just insane.
Like their guts are hanging out,

1003
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:24,250
their next ripped open

1004
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,140
and this dog was apparently,
you know,

1005
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:29,770
came back and that goes through
your action movie philosophy,

1006
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:34,210
which is the coyotes weren't waiting
for him to take on one dog at a time.

1007
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:38,380
Cause in your head you go, he just
took on one coyote to time. No, no,

1008
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:42,370
they all attacked and he beat all of
them. Yeah, he killed nine coyotes.

1009
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:46,920
That's what, and he's a, he's a domestic
dog and he's a pet. He's there to mass.

1010
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,580
And then do you ever see when your dog
gets like, Oh yeah, he's an animal.

1011
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:54,840
He, they're nice. Every
once in a while my Pipa,

1012
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,960
we'll do something that's like at the
dog park, he's unbelievably sweet.

1013
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,390
But a couple of times he's just been like,
by the way,

1014
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:03,940
I'm a pitbull and I'll just
fucking snap at somebody.

1015
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:07,660
And not somebody but another dog. It's
the, I'm proud of that as well. Yeah.

1016
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,070
You gotta be careful with
those things. Yeah. I,

1017
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:13,540
if I explained to him that pitbulls killed
people, he'd curl, he'd be confused.

1018
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:18,720
That's curly of you. So
show him, hit somebody.

1019
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:23,070
It's super impressive. Oh, this
is a two people we, that's right.

1020
00:57:23,071 --> 00:57:26,610
We use two people together
cause curly curly was so strong.

1021
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:30,030
It was one person was too ridiculous.
He was fucking people up.

1022
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,100
It's just such a horrible thing because
even though the dogs like you wearing a

1023
00:57:35,101 --> 00:57:38,700
big suit, your boot, the guy
was wearing a big giant suit.

1024
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,430
So it's like the dog
couldn't rip it apart.

1025
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,030
It's still clamping down on your
filling pressure, right? Yeah.

1026
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:46,620
It's like bone breaking pressure.

1027
00:57:46,621 --> 00:57:50,250
It's a giant animal and
not a coyote's best friend.

1028
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:54,220
But that dog is like,
it's as big and tough as that dog is.

1029
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:58,620
It's not like 120 pound pit bull, 2100
120 pound pit bull would kill that dog.

1030
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,370
It's a different animal. A pit bull
is a completely different species.

1031
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,060
The difference between what it
can do and what it can tolerate.

1032
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,130
So that's a smaller dog.
That's like a shepherd.

1033
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,900
Probably the difference between what it,
how it tolerate and it's killed drive.

1034
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,940
Like that's a perfect example.

1035
00:58:14,941 --> 00:58:19,770
That dog of selective breeding pitbulls
thousands of years of only taking dogs

1036
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,330
that will ignore pain,

1037
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,360
fight to the death and never back down
and keep it and use only those genetics

1038
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:31,620
and get rid of the ones that don't share
those genetics in such a cruel way.

1039
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:34,560
They would kill dogs, they would quit
and fights. They would kill them.

1040
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,790
They would take them out and kill them.

1041
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:39,630
And that was the whole deal
with a fuckhead. The uh,
the football. Yeah. Yeah.

1042
00:58:39,631 --> 00:58:43,320
Michael Vick is that he was
murdering dogs that quit. Yeah.

1043
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:46,860
Which is a longstanding
tradition. Yeah. It's terrible.

1044
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,130
I'm sure it was only made
illegal 50 years ago.

1045
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,160
I don't know when it was made
illegal. There's curly. Well,

1046
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:56,240
this dog grabs my dog's
unbelievably sweet.

1047
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:59,130
When someone knocks at the door
or tries to just jiggled it,

1048
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,610
he barks and goes to the door,

1049
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:04,340
but his tail wags.

1050
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:10,570
So my worry is I wonder if he
would know when I'm in danger.

1051
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,240
Oh yeah. He would know for
sure. They would smell it.

1052
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:19,270
They know what a dog senses
about a situation is so
much different than what we

1053
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:23,510
sense because they smell, especially
with live organisms, you know,

1054
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:28,130
we would understand danger like physical
objects, cars and things coming at you.

1055
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:32,450
The dog wouldn't, but dog smell
fear. They smell emotions. They'll,

1056
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,720
they'll smell this comfort. They'll,
they'll smell things on you.

1057
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:39,230
You'd give away pheromones and
if you were like in terrifying,

1058
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:43,790
a terrifying situation and someone was
violently going after the dog would smell

1059
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:47,390
intention like would literally
smell the intent of the attacker.

1060
00:59:47,630 --> 00:59:49,310
That's why dogs don't like certain people.

1061
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:51,110
When you got a creepy fuck
over your house and your dog

1062
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,500
or my dog only barks at
homeless people of all races,

1063
00:59:57,091 --> 01:00:01,500
he'll bark at homeless people and
drunk people that are walking weird.

1064
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,910
It's the,
I'm so,

1065
01:00:02,911 --> 01:00:07,860
I fucking love him for it because it is
people that I'm not that I'm creeped out

1066
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,720
by anyway. They're very, very soon

1067
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,670
our dogs, pit bulls, very smart dogs. But
look, I mean you think about a dog smell.

1068
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:17,480
Someone like you or someone like Brian
or anybody, they smelled fairly normal.

1069
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:19,710
You know, the varying a little bit,
then all of sudden you come around.

1070
01:00:19,711 --> 01:00:22,940
This guy wasn't Washington six years.
Yeah. He's covered his own pitch.

1071
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:26,620
You're like, Whoa, for a dog, you
know, bad must smell. It must be like

1072
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,030
Jesus fucking Rah, Rah Rah. Yeah.
Why don't you do it in my face?

1073
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,420
Like you're assaulting my notes,
your stinky piss soaked pants.

1074
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,360
I saw homeless woman last night
at the Highland, that church,

1075
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:42,100
that big church on Highland. Uh, and
uh, and yeah, if Franklin Franklin,

1076
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,560
uh,
this woman just co it was at a stop light,

1077
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:47,530
she just gets up and she was
like laying down. She stands up,

1078
01:00:47,531 --> 01:00:51,700
pulls down her pants into shits right in
front of all of us waiting in line and

1079
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:54,490
people started honking the horn and
she was like flipping everybody off and

1080
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:59,260
stuff. Yeah, I do. I judge
that, but I would shit if I
was in the woods, but for her,

1081
01:00:59,261 --> 01:01:02,260
that's the woods middle. This sidewalk.
She doesn't have a home, sir. Yeah.

1082
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,090
Where did you want to go?
Where you want it to go?

1083
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:08,440
You want to go to the Jack in the
box? Your toilet to Starbucks? Yeah.

1084
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,190
It's better than going to a
restaurant. I'm man. Yeah.

1085
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,530
Imagine if she walked out of
the, the bisexual. What is the,

1086
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,050
what's coed coed bathroom at
Starbucks. You go in after her. Yeah.

1087
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,110
Fucking a fucking cloud of fleas
and it's not just the shit.

1088
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:26,560
It's the everything.
It's like a flow thing and the end,

1089
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:30,640
the air is heavier. The feet. It's
like the God damn post office.

1090
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:34,210
[inaudible] cheese [inaudible]
taint cheese on the lid.

1091
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,200
You can't just wash that off with paper
towels and some lukewarm water from the

1092
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:42,280
sink. You got to hover over it. If you'd
take a shit two year old yeast infection,

1093
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:46,700
I don't take shit.
Please. Absolutely fine.

1094
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:51,370
I've been taken a shit in public.
I think it lifetime under five.

1095
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,240
I did one yesterday. Don't be scared if
you have to take a shit and take a shit.

1096
01:01:55,241 --> 01:01:58,540
That's what a bathrooms for. I don't
care. I don't care if I'm here. My farts,

1097
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:02,650
I don't care if you hear the plop
and splash. There's bathrooms. Shit.

1098
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:06,490
I got a whole, you know I have a day
and we talked about in that for you.

1099
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,680
I got one of those Japanese toilets.
Warms your asshole with a hairdryer. Yeah,

1100
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,780
I got it. The tone. I toil. I drink a lot
of Kale shakes, man. You can't just, yeah

1101
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,590
judge when your shits are coming.
If you're drinking Kale shakes,

1102
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:17,930
you've got to accept the fact
you're gonna shit six times a day.

1103
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,860
So a lot of times I'm not home.

1104
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,400
Okay, so I got to shit. I also
would like to take a 1520 minute,

1105
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,893
those are nine down.

1106
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,080
Especially if you have a bad diet
and you go slowly push out poop.

1107
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:29,840
No,
it all comes out.

1108
01:02:29,841 --> 01:02:32,520
I don't need to be there and say
it was you buddy pass and no,

1109
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:36,840
get the fuck outta here.
Rogan and Mike Shit is fine.
It's a little defensive. Hey,

1110
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,420
who the fuck are you? Yo,
you better tell your friends.

1111
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,680
Nursing friendly person
talking about poop.

1112
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,070
Someone said he doesn't want to look like
a little shit story a little earlier,

1113
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,960
like a shit story.
But I do like,

1114
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:52,610
I know I do like talking about taking
long shifts. I do like have a day store.

1115
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:56,620
It seems different. I'm also not trying,
I don't like shit stories on stage.

1116
01:02:57,470 --> 01:03:00,830
Big Daddy Kane was on our podcast last
night and told a story where he was

1117
01:03:00,831 --> 01:03:04,550
trying to pee on a girl and
ended up shitting on himself.

1118
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,260
So great story. So it is a very
great story and a, that'll be

1119
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,980
Jim Breuer has a story about his,
uh,

1120
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,820
his dad shitting himself that bill burst
says when the funniest bits he's ever

1121
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:20,910
seen in his life. It's
like a 10 minute. Yeah.

1122
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,470
And it's like a destruction
bit and then he closes with it.

1123
01:03:23,471 --> 01:03:27,400
I guess it's supposed to be unbelievable.
It's a shed story. So how dare you.

1124
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,650
Yes. That's not impossible. Brian
closes with this shit. Right?

1125
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:36,600
A lot of shit stories going around. Neil
Brennan, Fan of Shit Joke. I'm just not,

1126
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,570
not into it. Just not into it.
Okay. It's all right. You know,

1127
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:43,190
I understand you have
to defend your position.

1128
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:44,960
You'll reconsider after this is over.

1129
01:03:44,961 --> 01:03:48,140
You go back and you know you want
to drive home. Hey, pull over.

1130
01:03:48,141 --> 01:03:51,340
I think Jill might've been right. Shit
stories. What's bad and what's good?

1131
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:54,830
What's bad. But I'm saying
like as a, you know, onstage,

1132
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:58,950
I opened with one off side just hey,
you're a shitty dude. What can you say?

1133
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:02,640
Ooh.
Put that anywhere

1134
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,890
near what the shit jokes.
What I tell Ya.

1135
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,650
Yeah, yeah. No, no subject
is off limits. It's just,

1136
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:18,340
you just have to have something to say
about that subject so it has to be legit.

1137
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:22,930
What do you do it by the ass hair? What
do I do personally? I just deal with it.

1138
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:26,440
You don't whack. I shaved my
balls where I leave my ass alone.

1139
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,250
It's probably not a good strategy
as far as like cleanliness.

1140
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,530
I had a friend who was shaved his ass
and I was like, why do you do that?

1141
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:36,580
And he's like, dude, I got tired of having
shit in my pants all the time. He goes,

1142
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:39,580
if you have a hairy ass and you
smell it smeared with toilet paper,

1143
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:43,750
what do you think is going on
there? Yeah. I've always said,

1144
01:04:43,751 --> 01:04:47,320
it's like peanut butter
from a shag carpet. You're
rubbing it in your ash hairs.

1145
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,850
He's like, I got a hairy ass.
It's just not cleanliness,
not cleanline. So he goes,

1146
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:55,440
I started shaving my ass and now it's
beautiful. He knows now I wipe it.

1147
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,450
Then I baby wipe it and boom.
I have a clean ass all the time.

1148
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,700
My underwear smells better.
I don't itch as much better.

1149
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,380
He got married like eyelashes though.
It's supposed to protect it.

1150
01:05:05,381 --> 01:05:07,660
So like spiders and
protected from spiders.

1151
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:11,013
Good point.

1152
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:16,960
I lashes fill out this questionnaire
to apply for your doctor examination.

1153
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:24,100
Hmm. What are eyelashes for? To protect
you from spider fighters. Next question.

1154
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,710
Don't insult my intelligence.
I'm going to med school. Sure.

1155
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:28,240
Well we have just have a few questions,

1156
01:05:28,241 --> 01:05:32,330
but human body anatomy and what you know
and she is and what are the actions for,

1157
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,900
what's the hair growing out of your
ear for a keep you from getting vd?

1158
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,980
It is. You're right though. It is for
protection. Yeah, it's from dust, right?

1159
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:46,840
And little particles keeps from what?
You've got. Hair covering your brain,

1160
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,590
covering your mouth, covering your Dick
and ass. You know, something real weird.

1161
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:54,100
Your thickest hair and your chest.
Technically he knows I'm really weird.

1162
01:05:54,101 --> 01:05:56,260
Even when it's really cold out,
your eyes don't get cold,

1163
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:00,460
your eyeballs don't get cold. It's really
strange. Like we were in Wisconsin,

1164
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:03,820
it was like fucking zero degrees outside
and the wind was whipping around.

1165
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,040
It was really cold, really
cold, but I was like,

1166
01:06:06,041 --> 01:06:09,400
isn't it weird that my eyes aren't cold?
And then the guys I was with were like,

1167
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:10,870
yeah, my eyes aren't cold
either. That is weird.

1168
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:13,990
Everything else is fucking freezing.
Your toes are inside boots,

1169
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,200
insulated boots and we'll and
your fucking feet are numb.

1170
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:22,020
You remember that from Columbus? Those
fingers freezing. But your eyes we, yeah.

1171
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:26,280
Why won't your ice freeze? I don't
know. The West is also, that's like,

1172
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,180
that's a stone thought hall of fame

1173
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,100
that goes like that and the nominees are,

1174
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:35,890
and the inductees this year are,

1175
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:40,120
why don't your know your eyes
hold Joe Rogan. Thank you.

1176
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,840
Thank you very much. Thank you
very much. I appreciate it. Yeah,

1177
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,600
I got high time stoner of the
year award. They do. Really? Yeah.

1178
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,840
I'm supposed to like figure
out if I can go to some,

1179
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,390
I'm not supposed to say that, but I'm
supposed to say that. Whoops. Whoops.

1180
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:58,720
I got it. Either way. Have you not
one before times, uh, corruption.

1181
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,280
Clearly the man, I don't know. You
know, I think, uh, it's ridiculous.

1182
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:07,150
Like I don't even want it. There's, Ooh,
there's an answer. I mean, I want it,

1183
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:11,560
but I'm not saying it's a bad thing. What
I'm saying is that, uh, you know, saint,

1184
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:14,860
anybody's the best stoner
fucking ridiculous.

1185
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:18,640
It's just the most famous stoner too.
I think it's the,

1186
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:20,260
the good thing is,

1187
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,970
is to celebrate that there's a lot of
people that enjoy marijuana and now that

1188
01:07:24,971 --> 01:07:27,700
it's finally slowly starting
to actually get legal,

1189
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,440
it's good to see people that enjoy it
and are not spiraling out of control of

1190
01:07:32,441 --> 01:07:35,890
your life. I got to say, I happy,
I like the shit in Colorado.

1191
01:07:35,891 --> 01:07:40,750
You know about that bank stuff. Yes.
I think that's really fucking stupid.

1192
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:44,090
It is stupid. It's just stupid. It's
evil. It's evil and it's all it.

1193
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,090
It's like what it is for
people who don't know,

1194
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:51,150
basically these dispensary's are
making a ton of cash mans yeah.

1195
01:07:52,721 --> 01:07:54,690
They're making something
like one dispensary.

1196
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:59,200
I'll have 400 grand for the week or
something more for the week. Small one.

1197
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:03,340
$1 million the first day.
First Day. Yeah. Uh, so,

1198
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:08,341
but the problem is banks will not accept
the account that vape banks will not

1199
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,250
accept money that's been
made on selling drugs.

1200
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,980
So basically they have to
exchange them into money

1201
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,160
orders and shit like that.

1202
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:21,600
Unless those drugs are oxycontin.
PROZAC.

1203
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:23,520
Lithium. Yeah. Yeah.

1204
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,270
Uh, so yeah, so the,

1205
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,630
it's so like these people who want to
Spencer's or having to switch cars and

1206
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:33,890
like be on the lookout because they
opened a weed store, which is just stupid.

1207
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:37,850
It's like you can't, you kind of can't
legalize it. And they'd be like, Nah.

1208
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:41,900
Well what they're doing is trying to
hold back this inevitable tide. Yeah.

1209
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:45,430
The inevitable tide of legalization people
fed up, man, I'm a fucking grown man.

1210
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:48,760
I don't want another grown man telling
me I can't smoke pot. It's too late.

1211
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:49,331
All right.

1212
01:08:49,331 --> 01:08:53,710
It's 2000 and God damn 14 it's not
going to ruin your life no matter what

1213
01:08:53,711 --> 01:08:55,330
fucking Nancy grace tells you.

1214
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:58,330
It's not going to ruin your life no
matter what any of these knuckleheads tell

1215
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:02,860
you it is not what's wrong. If
there's issues, if you have issues,

1216
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,780
I mean psychologically, what does
this that your playing and Brian,

1217
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,950
the Nancy versus Nancy where
she contradicts herself
though about marijuana and

1218
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:12,860
we're, you know in the past
with Zimmerman though because

1219
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,950
she ain't hear you.
Taffy. I mean people on

1220
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,570
no the good do it from the beginning
because otherwise it's not going to make

1221
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:19,404
any sense.

1222
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:24,310
I think she was supporting Trayvon Martin
not being violent because he's right.

1223
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:24,950
Oh Wow.

1224
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:29,950
An evidence that Trayvon Martin did have
marijuana in his system at the time he

1225
01:09:32,231 --> 01:09:36,790
died. What difference, if any,
does that make out to you? Taffy?

1226
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:41,640
I mean, people on pot that shoot each
other, the right stab each other.

1227
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:44,980
I've strangling each other,
drive under the influence.

1228
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,900
Isn't it true that when you smoke pot,

1229
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:51,610
you just want to lay on the sofa and
eight? I mean, you do know it's addictive.

1230
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,070
Highly addictive, right? I mean,

1231
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:59,100
the common connotation
part goes with lethargy,

1232
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:03,430
with uh,
the munchies with wanting to eat,

1233
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:07,280
which looks like Angela
Lansbury about kill families,

1234
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,380
wipe out a whole family
system.

1235
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:16,030
To me it means that he is less likely to
pick a fight with somebody you've never

1236
01:10:16,031 --> 01:10:19,960
met. Nick Diaz. She ended
up losing her job. Oh,

1237
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,500
wrecked her car, couldn't make
the house payments on our house.

1238
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:29,040
This is a real problem. She's Indian.
She's a demon sent from Satan to ruin our,

1239
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:33,780
our fucking lives and spreading nonsense.
That's hilarious.

1240
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:38,080
Just the fact that she communicates,
it's such a sloppy way. That's the,

1241
01:10:38,081 --> 01:10:41,290
that's how she organizes her thoughts
and distributes them on hello.

1242
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,190
It's all terror. Oh,
she's in constant terror.

1243
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,590
It's full talk. It's talk for fools, which
she was doing was just saying, you know,

1244
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,000
it was all,
you know,

1245
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:55,310
flavoring the reality with their
own stupid ideas. It's just gross.

1246
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,410
It's nonsense. You know, she couldn't fit.

1247
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:00,530
She couldn't make up her mind what it is.
Does Pot make you violent?

1248
01:11:00,531 --> 01:11:02,390
Does it make you lazy?
Does it ruin lives?

1249
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,720
Does it make you lethargic and eat
chips? Which one is it? You know,

1250
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,150
it's, SNL had a very funny skit this past
weekend. That's hardly possible. Yeah,

1251
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,670
it's 2014. No, no, no. It was
Drake did a fucking cat Williams.

1252
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:19,620
He did a cat Williams impression.
That was fucking hilarious,

1253
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:23,900
Brian. Okay. Uh, it's to
take a, we'll take a minute,

1254
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:27,950
we'll just load it up and pause it so that
we have it's spooled up. But uh, yeah,

1255
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,240
I'd say it's time man.

1256
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:33,260
And there's nothing to do with like
you don't want it what it has to do,

1257
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:34,850
even if I didn't smoke weed.
Okay.

1258
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:39,290
What it has to do with his grown adults
telling you what to do. That's stupid.

1259
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,880
How do you find,
have you driven drunk and driven stone?

1260
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,590
I don't drive drunk. Have you and your
life? I have, when I was really young,

1261
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,740
I maybe did it a couple of times and I
realized how fucking dumb it was and I

1262
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:51,790
got away with it, but I
wasn't like sloppy, hammered.

1263
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:55,250
Like I could walk straight and I
certainly was under the influence though.

1264
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:59,510
And I got away with it and I realize like
that is a dangerous thing that's easy

1265
01:11:59,511 --> 01:12:03,980
to do. It's easy to just leave a party
fucked up to leave a bar fucked up.

1266
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,560
I don't, you know, when
I was in high school,

1267
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:10,910
a good friend that I knew from high school
killed his friend in a drunk driving

1268
01:12:10,911 --> 01:12:14,570
accident. Nice kid in my neighborhood.
He said he was a nice guy.

1269
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,970
I used to say hi to him all the time.

1270
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:21,290
I saw him all the time and I ran into
him maybe six months after the accident

1271
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:25,880
after, you know, he had, he's got all
this legal problems, his friend's dead,

1272
01:12:25,881 --> 01:12:29,300
his life is devastated. And I remember
that, look on that kid's face.

1273
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:30,021
I was passing him,

1274
01:12:30,021 --> 01:12:32,150
I was coming home from work and he
was passing me on the street and I go,

1275
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:33,530
what's up man? He goes,
hey, how are you doing?

1276
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:35,510
And I could see the look in his face,
man.

1277
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:39,440
He was just devastated six months later,
just devastated.

1278
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:43,760
And I internalized that shit
and I absorbed that shit
and I said, God damn it.

1279
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:47,930
Learned from that. Don't do that. Don't
do that. Yeah, that's a scary thing.

1280
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,940
Don't drive trunk, man. But driving
high is a completely different thing.

1281
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:57,110
It's not a good idea to drive high if
you don't know what being highest that's

1282
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:59,660
for fuck shore. If you're not a
person who gets high all the time,

1283
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,130
driving high is not a good idea. It's also
not a good idea. If you're on edibles,

1284
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:08,510
edibles are way more powerful. Well,
there's a lot of visual shit with edibles,

1285
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:12,830
right? Well, it's distortion. It's
distortion of w of the experience,

1286
01:13:12,831 --> 01:13:15,800
distortion of the experience of life.
And I think if if,

1287
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,060
unless you're eating animals all the
time and you know what that distortion

1288
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,380
feels like, it can be very
distracting. You know?

1289
01:13:21,381 --> 01:13:23,600
It's like you're not supposed to have
a fucking phone up to your head while

1290
01:13:23,601 --> 01:13:26,930
you're driving. You definitely shouldn't
be driving on pot cookies, you know?

1291
01:13:26,931 --> 01:13:31,931
But I know people who smoke weed and
drive all the time and they're fine.

1292
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,100
I know. Also people though that
do Jujitsu high all the time.

1293
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:37,950
They smoke.

1294
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:41,810
I know people who podcast tank,
go ahead. Yeah, I'm not dude.

1295
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:45,360
You can not believe it all you
want, Joe. I've seen it, man.

1296
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:49,170
You have nonsense and propaganda
spouting out of your mouth.

1297
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:54,910
Fuck man. Bullshit. But I think that,
you know, hold off for a second one that,

1298
01:13:57,010 --> 01:14:00,780
um, what was I saying? Drive high.

1299
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,330
Look, some people can handle
it, some people can't. It's not,

1300
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,400
it's not a black and white situation,

1301
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:10,360
but what is black and white
is the influence of marijuana
is very different than

1302
01:14:10,361 --> 01:14:13,450
the influence of very,
very, very different.

1303
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,810
We were talking about it before the show
that Obama had just recently said that

1304
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:20,340
he thinks that pot is just as
safe as alcohol or out. No,

1305
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,030
no more dangerous and alcohol,

1306
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:24,580
whatever his statement was
and how that was a big deal.

1307
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:28,540
It's a big deal to hear from a president
2014 regardless of what we know about

1308
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:29,374
his past.

1309
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:33,240
Yeah. It's still like he,
yeah, he did he smoke weed?

1310
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:35,940
He said he used to buy coke
when he could afford it. Yeah.

1311
01:14:35,941 --> 01:14:37,890
That's my favorite fucking quote of all.

1312
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:42,510
It's like I used to buy a little blow
when I could afford it by in a book by

1313
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,750
Barack Obama.
It's so

1314
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:44,530
great.

1315
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:47,890
It's such a fucking ridiculous thing
that we're supposed to pretend that these

1316
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:50,470
people who were running the
presidency or running whatever,

1317
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:53,970
the being a senator when that they're
immune from all the things. Yeah,

1318
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:57,960
us and we and our friends did
growing up like, oh, they didn't,

1319
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,310
they never drank before.
They were 21 really?

1320
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:04,600
What kind of weird square never gets a
hold of a little booze before they're 21

1321
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,940
well, that's what Christopher
Hitchens one time said,

1322
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,040
Bill and Hillary were fond of edibles.

1323
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,850
He actually said he didn't because he
went to Oxford with them. He goes, no,

1324
01:15:12,851 --> 01:15:14,950
they didn't inhale.
They like to eat.

1325
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,110
Ah, well that makes sense, man.

1326
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,130
Completely different experience made
the man visionary fucked him up when he

1327
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:23,530
came down to that one chick though.
That was ridiculous.

1328
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,520
Yeah. That's what, when you
get, do you ever, I mean,

1329
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:28,800
you've worked at places when you
have interns and you're like,

1330
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:32,370
whenever I've interns, I'm like, I
wouldn't fuck any of these girls.

1331
01:15:32,371 --> 01:15:35,640
Just you can't, it's like,
well, you definitely can't
when you're the president,

1332
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:38,670
right. When you can't, when you're
the executive producer, you can't,

1333
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:41,310
when you're the right. I
didn't, I felt like I wouldn't,

1334
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,290
I felt sometimes it's like
fucking an intern is like
executing a retarded person.

1335
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,260
It's like it's just not a fair fight.
Okay. This is a bad example. Here's what,

1336
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:51,420
here's why it's a bad example.

1337
01:15:51,421 --> 01:15:55,380
You're a young single guy who's
producing a television show.

1338
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:59,700
He's the old married man.
I would rate US army.

1339
01:15:59,701 --> 01:16:01,320
The free world has ever known.

1340
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:04,020
He's the commander in chief and
he's getting blown by interns.

1341
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:09,050
That's like he's executing
some questionable judgment
and incredibly powerful

1342
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:12,930
position. That's exactly my point.
Only blow jobs out your own.

1343
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,720
That's exactly my point though. I
would, I wouldn't fucking intern to.

1344
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:20,580
He would like, dude, it's a, it's an
abuse of power on my part. It's the one,

1345
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,940
it's a wildly abuse of power in your part,
I would say spoils of war,

1346
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,680
but you know, potato patato
nobody gets to be the president,

1347
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:32,380
you know, like easily.
It's a fucking [inaudible].

1348
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,940
You should get like one a month.
Like you literally should be.

1349
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:39,810
It should be in the vous. Well, if they
had it rigged, right. The problem is

1350
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:41,910
they all wrap on each other.
This is the real problem.

1351
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:46,740
Like the FBI's ratting on the CIA,
the CIA's investigating this guy,

1352
01:16:46,741 --> 01:16:50,250
the senator,
and if they all just like chilled out,

1353
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,720
they could have an endless supply of
Russian hookers come over to the White

1354
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:57,360
House, has dignitaries and,
and have a great old time.

1355
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,410
Secret Service had that
in Puerto Rico apparently.

1356
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:04,340
Apparently they didn't want to pay.
That's, what was it? Puerto Rico was,

1357
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:07,760
I think it was, yeah, I thought
it was South America, but
whatever, whatever it was.

1358
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:11,060
The CIA got some prostitutes and
didn't want to give up the money,

1359
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:15,740
which is fucking rude. Rude,
expecting ruby. Just like
eating the whole plant foot.

1360
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:19,940
Yeah, it was a serious,
yeah. Yeah. Um, look man,

1361
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:23,480
it's just sex once they have robot fucked
dolls that look exactly like people

1362
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:24,530
like blade runner style.

1363
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:26,430
I actually had that argument.

1364
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:31,490
I asked the girl I was dating if
I fucked a robot who looked like,

1365
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:36,480
who had like sort of like the stove,
which deny a robot,

1366
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:39,510
like one of those like vodka of robot,

1367
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,660
those vodka commercials where
it's like a sexy cyborg.

1368
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:44,910
If I fucked that robot

1369
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:51,440
or I fucked a robot that looked like the
terminator where it was more metallic,

1370
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:56,510
the girl said she'd be way matter if
the robot had smooth skin than if it had

1371
01:17:57,841 --> 01:17:58,800
metallic skin.

1372
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:02,080
Yeah, because it would be like, it's
not cheating. If you fuck a desk

1373
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,660
that's fucking hilarious
about up the whole

1374
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:09,750
and fight and she catches you fucking
the dash. She's just going to go,

1375
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:11,250
what's wrong with you Neal Brennan?
Yeah.

1376
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:12,160
Well that's awesome.

1377
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,550
That elemental thing about
guys want to fuck when they go.

1378
01:18:16,551 --> 01:18:18,810
Like it's not just a whole I,

1379
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:21,800
it's not just the whole
cause I'd fuck of warm melon.

1380
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:23,810
I'd fuck it fucking hand one of those.

1381
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:25,850
Whatever those things he used
to especially I haven't, yeah.

1382
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:30,080
Fleshlight it's I want a woman.
I want to trick a woman.

1383
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:33,370
You want to trick them well than
that's kind of what you're doing. Oh,

1384
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:36,190
that's what it is. No, it's
not tricky. What it is,

1385
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:38,530
you having sex with someone
who wants to have sex with you,

1386
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,910
enjoying each other's body. What are
you? Fuck, there's a certain amount.

1387
01:18:42,911 --> 01:18:46,990
It's a trick. It's fucking, there's a
certain amount of seduction involved.

1388
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:49,660
It's like Don Rawlings. She
used to say, let's listen.

1389
01:18:49,661 --> 01:18:54,490
Let's go out and trick bitches.
Wow. When you go to a bar,

1390
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:59,230
it's a bit of Hocus pocus. Let's be
honest. You tell your best stories,

1391
01:18:59,231 --> 01:19:03,190
you tell your, you try it. You fucking,
you try to look as cute as possible.

1392
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:06,820
You hold doors open. You
don't act like yourself. Well,

1393
01:19:06,821 --> 01:19:10,060
he's in the goal in life to get to a
point where you don't have to do that.

1394
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:11,390
Isn't that the real goal in line?

1395
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,980
I bet you were way nicer
to your girlfriend on your
fucking third date than you

1396
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:15,610
are now.

1397
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:19,660
This is, oh no, that's not true
at all. Me. No. Personally,
no. That's not true at all.

1398
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:22,240
And not only that,
I would think that you're different.

1399
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:25,840
You're dealing also with the difference
between you when you're 21 and you're

1400
01:19:25,841 --> 01:19:30,841
just getting into the came has missed a
white folks would say the game or when

1401
01:19:31,421 --> 01:19:34,510
you're 40, you know, and yeah,
you should be a man by now.

1402
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,910
Oh yeah man.
I'm not saying you're not,

1403
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:39,760
you see a man with my shit
or snow sovereign. Yeah.

1404
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,200
Tea,

1405
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,310
you should be a band that really is not
trying to impress a bunch of people and

1406
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:47,450
is can live in his own skin and not
putting on a God damn show. You know,

1407
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,430
putting clown shoes on
when you walk out the door.

1408
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:53,810
All right, Jorge meals here.
You know, you're not doing it

1409
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,560
that your men now, you
know, that's the difference.

1410
01:19:56,561 --> 01:19:57,910
That's why you shouldn't say trick girls.
Anyway.

1411
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:01,380
I understand. Back in the
day it was a different way.
It's also just a funny term.

1412
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:04,890
It is very funny.
And also it's a bitches.

1413
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,780
Let's go to that con trick.

1414
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,110
Fucking, it's also funny, you're coming
from a black guard. What isn't. Um,

1415
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,180
but uh, yeah, but yeah,
like let's cut and trim.

1416
01:20:16,290 --> 01:20:20,250
I mean there is a certain amount of like,
you know chicanery involved for sure.

1417
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,101
Well you know,

1418
01:20:21,101 --> 01:20:24,220
and also I when I always say be the man
you pretended to be where you're trying

1419
01:20:24,221 --> 01:20:25,870
to get laid,
be actually be that guy.

1420
01:20:26,380 --> 01:20:29,140
It might take a long time
and want to take some steps,

1421
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,020
but work your way up to actually being
that guy and then you don't have to

1422
01:20:32,021 --> 01:20:35,650
pretend every time you get laid back is
actually who you are. I totally agree.

1423
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:39,690
Be An actual admirable person and you'll
get some pussy Neal Brennan you do you

1424
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:44,500
think? No. Yeah, I think you could fuck. I
think if you had to get thrown down. Yeah,

1425
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,410
I do. All right. If I had a gas I
do. All right. I bet you put in work.

1426
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:51,160
I bet you'd take it seriously. I bet
you're a very shamed of poor performances.

1427
01:20:51,161 --> 01:20:52,810
I bet you make an Ikea them.
Thank you.

1428
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,400
And you don't want to
hold this fucking phone,

1429
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:56,590
the start flashing every
time you get a goddamn text,

1430
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,240
you one of those really needy fucks.

1431
01:20:58,241 --> 01:21:02,260
It has that setting on your phone where
the flash, the back flash goes like this.

1432
01:21:02,261 --> 01:21:04,150
Every time you have a tax flash flash.
I says,

1433
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:07,740
I bet you have it every time someone
tweets you to you do. No, no. Come on man.

1434
01:21:07,741 --> 01:21:08,980
Those are Twitter notifications.

1435
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,790
Joe, come on. Motha the comedy club.

1436
01:21:10,791 --> 01:21:13,520
That's so annoying cause you're on stage
and you think people are taking photos

1437
01:21:13,521 --> 01:21:16,220
of you. Cause I know a lot of
people have those flashes. Oh yeah.

1438
01:21:16,221 --> 01:21:18,410
And they keep them in the
desk. Yeah. On the table.

1439
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:22,670
You know what I think that gets
integrated with a sexual performance.

1440
01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:27,320
Um, because a buddy of mine and I have
talked about this problem solving,

1441
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:33,020
much of say cunnilingus is
you're solving a puzzle.

1442
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:38,750
And I think that the smarter you are,
the better you would be a kind of legacy.

1443
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,730
Maybe. But unless the girl is very
vocal, some girls are very vocal. Yeah.

1444
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:45,440
But even the vocal ones,
it's like you have to,

1445
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:49,970
you have to discern what's
is that you're gonna come,

1446
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:54,590
you might come, stop, do it, go
to the right, go to the left.

1447
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:58,160
It is very, it's a bit like a video, you
know, it's like a, it's a problem solving.

1448
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:02,550
It's also very variable as far as what
people like and I absolutely guests or

1449
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,780
blowjobs cause you ever get a blowjob
from a girl just locks a hold of the tip,

1450
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:10,980
like a sucker fish and just
starts hammering the the
shaft and you're like, whoa,

1451
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:14,310
whoa, whoa. Who likes
this? I know. Crazy shit.

1452
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:20,010
Whoa. Slow it down. We're
getting crazy over here.

1453
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,340
Talked about what, what makes it
a fantastic blowjob on the show?

1454
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:27,360
Various, I dunno what you
like, but I bet it's weird.

1455
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,480
I Bet I'm going to disagree with this,
but it involves trickery.

1456
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,700
It involves cards and fucking Ravitz
coming out of a hat. What's this?

1457
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,710
It's like that scene in diner
would make you work a had a bet.

1458
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,640
See if we can get a girl to grab his dick
and the first date and he won because

1459
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:45,810
he put his dick inside of boxes.

1460
01:22:46,150 --> 01:22:51,040
Oh yeah, you're taking a box. Yeah.
No, I think I have my things, but I,

1461
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:55,210
I agree with you that I don't,
I don't, don't they? It's
not, don't fucking try to,

1462
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,990
it's all good dude. As long as
I'm happy, she, it's very nice.

1463
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,120
It's a beautiful thing. I'm glad
they do it. We have it way easier.

1464
01:23:04,121 --> 01:23:05,890
Like a girl comes.
It's

1465
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,030
really not inconvenient. So
yeah, nothing Ha. It's invisible.

1466
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,780
You don't have to swallow
a gallon of fucking,

1467
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:14,750
and you also don't have to be judged on
one of the, you swallow or not like true.

1468
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,690
She's was like woody.
Once it's out of my body,

1469
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:21,530
I kind of don't care what she does.
Obviously the swallowing,

1470
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:24,890
swallowing feels uh,
more complete.

1471
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:28,100
She's filthier,
which is great.

1472
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:32,390
It's all she like if she gets you,
she wants to ingest you.

1473
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:36,630
That's very flattering. But
ultimately it's like, it's,

1474
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,150
it's a little silly.

1475
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:41,650
Okay. Incorrect.
Disagree. It's everything.

1476
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:44,710
It's really important because
that's a girl that you want.

1477
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:47,260
That's a girl who's willing to
do something absolutely crazy.

1478
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:51,520
Suck your dick and swallow your comm and
then smile at you. That's what you want.

1479
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:54,150
You want to grow who just
releases all over inhibition.

1480
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:57,130
She's doing something wild savage.

1481
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,700
But I think there's so many
of them do at this point.

1482
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:00,990
So many of them do it at this point.

1483
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:04,200
Now you're flip flop and you should be a
goddamn politician. What are you saying,

1484
01:24:04,201 --> 01:24:08,190
Neil Brennan to it at this point?
So many women do it.

1485
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:12,730
I don't know. I'd never taken a blow
job statistic. I'm not like, excuse me,

1486
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:16,540
Joe and my work. While you're stepping
out of a anthropology at the mall, can I,

1487
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,130
can I ask you,
if you fill this out,

1488
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,520
how do you feel when it got comes in
your mouth, you rushing to the bathroom?

1489
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:25,240
Are you showing them a good time?
I find that 80% swell. Okay.

1490
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:27,880
And Mike would try to
kiss you right after.

1491
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:31,600
For me, I think what's nice
about girls is they give,

1492
01:24:31,601 --> 01:24:35,680
they know to leave a window,
don't kiss you for at least five minutes.

1493
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:37,200
They're good about it.

1494
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,200
What's fun about sex is two people
enjoying it and being loose and having,

1495
01:24:43,650 --> 01:24:48,450
you know, no inhibitions. When someone
has inhibitions, it's not fun, clumsy.

1496
01:24:48,451 --> 01:24:50,340
It fucks up the whole vibe of the thing.

1497
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:54,390
And I'm not saying like asked to mouth
or something ridiculous and unhygienic

1498
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:57,450
I'm just talking about regular stuff.
Something ridiculous and fantastic.

1499
01:24:57,451 --> 01:25:01,590
Like mouth says, you know, I have
no interest in. He Kolai some,

1500
01:25:01,591 --> 01:25:04,830
someone works for the pharmaceutical
companies. He's here to sell antibiotics.

1501
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:09,510
Fair. Go asked him mouth. It's
fucking beautiful. Line of six people.

1502
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:14,160
Hi, I'm from Eli Lilly. Yeah. He bought
them sit like that. A lot of it's,

1503
01:25:14,161 --> 01:25:18,210
I feel like a lot of guys sexual
stuff now. It's so much of,

1504
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:22,710
it's just about power. You
are the weirdest motherfucker.
It's about trickery.

1505
01:25:22,711 --> 01:25:26,100
It's about, no, I really do. It's
standup. Doesn't joke about trickery.

1506
01:25:26,101 --> 01:25:29,370
It's just like, but it's about like
I want to come on your, I'll just,

1507
01:25:29,371 --> 01:25:31,740
it's like I'm going to do this
to you and you're going to,

1508
01:25:31,770 --> 01:25:35,040
it's like you're going to take it.
It's like, is she going to take it?

1509
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:37,320
That's what I'm saying.
I don't, I'm not into it,

1510
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:40,500
but I'm saying like there is a strain
of that. I'm really not into it.

1511
01:25:40,501 --> 01:25:43,920
I'm saying there's a strain of that.
I feel like red band,

1512
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:45,030
you could be a part of that.

1513
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,980
There is a strain of like of domination,
Shit like that.

1514
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:51,031
Like there's a,

1515
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:55,350
there's an element of conquering to male
sexuality that I don't know if there is

1516
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:56,420
two female sexual actuality.

1517
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:00,350
I think you're missing the being an actual
man part and that's why you feel this

1518
01:26:00,351 --> 01:26:02,870
way. I think it's devastating
to your self esteem.

1519
01:26:03,130 --> 01:26:07,440
So you don't feel like an actual man.
So you want to do trickery and domination.

1520
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,280
You want, you're holding these
girls down and titty fucking him.

1521
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:13,830
I see what you're saying or confusing.
A lot of different stories are,

1522
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:18,680
and Stallone is there watching
your eyes are not cold.

1523
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:24,970
Oh
No.

1524
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,870
Play that. Um, um, thing. The dance
grace. Yeah, the Nancy grace thing. Sorry.

1525
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:32,580
Lab thing.

1526
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:33,680
What were his promise?

1527
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,760
You Damn Right Nancy pimping.
Pimping baby.

1528
01:26:43,610 --> 01:26:44,443
Okay,

1529
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:48,320
I understand you're in Denver,

1530
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:53,150
Nancy. I am from Atlanta, but if we eat
is going to be legal up here in Colorado,

1531
01:26:53,270 --> 01:26:55,580
then consider me for
elbow rocky mountain high.

1532
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,100
I mean

1533
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,170
I'm not leaving until wildfires.

1534
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:03,770
Burn up this whole state and make
all of Wyoming get the munchies.

1535
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:04,604
You hear what I'm saying?

1536
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,100
Wow.

1537
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:10,380
I'm sorry Mr Cat will I find you very
charming. Oh, I never thought of Bio II.

1538
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:14,950
Nancy, please. It is a mother
loving utopia up in here. Okay.

1539
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:19,480
Just yesterday I saw 10 different
strangers make musical instruments out of

1540
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:22,420
trash cans. They formed
a whole band. Nancy,

1541
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:25,930
these mother lovers didn't know each
other three hours ago and now they're all

1542
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:28,620
suddenly in colon. The
gang. It's a beautiful day.

1543
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:34,390
So you're saying this is a utopia
and ever bins. All Dabi lamb power.

1544
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:38,830
It's your sale days. Do you want
your cab robber to be Paul and Paul?

1545
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:44,140
Do you want your babysitter
to be a Po Po Nancy?

1546
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,400
I am Kat Williams.

1547
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,050
I have not been around someone who
wasn't high on pot for the past 15 years.

1548
01:27:51,051 --> 01:27:52,910
Nancy, please don't trip on me baby. Okay.

1549
01:27:54,050 --> 01:27:54,390
Okay.

1550
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:57,180
Hold on. This is not nearly as
good as you promoted it. No,

1551
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,830
there's a line coming up.
It's very funny. Check might

1552
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:03,400
Nancy,

1553
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,720
somewhere out there is a man wearing
nothing but a snuggie and shower shoes and

1554
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:10,240
he is only half as crazy as y'all as okay.
You good?

1555
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,800
Is that the line that was like, wow,
okay. It's a good impression though,

1556
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,800
is a very good impression. But it sucks
here. And I'm saying mother loving.

1557
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:24,340
Oh yeah. The one that makes it a brand
through it. This stuff like that.

1558
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:28,030
I'm like Sarit lives like, Gosh,
you're so fucking handcuffed. Yeah.

1559
01:28:28,810 --> 01:28:32,500
It's a perfect example of why working
clean is not funnier like that.

1560
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,210
There's a perfect example. If you could
be actually talk like Katt Williams,

1561
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,750
motherfucker and nigger come out of
his mouth every other word. I mean,

1562
01:28:40,751 --> 01:28:44,170
that's half of the appeal of this
crazy little dude. Yeah. You know,

1563
01:28:44,171 --> 01:28:48,640
it's like he's just, he's wild little
stoned out dude. That's, you know,

1564
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,860
but Drake is good actor, man.
That was good impression.

1565
01:28:50,980 --> 01:28:53,860
Nancy grace wasn't bad either.
Yeah. I would like to see them.

1566
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:56,800
I would like to see someone pull off
something like Saturday night live,

1567
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:01,170
but be able to do it on the internet
or be able to do it on showtime or

1568
01:29:01,171 --> 01:29:01,980
somewhere where they just

1569
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,210
leave them the fuck alone.

1570
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:08,380
Like a, uh, a like a
multi-camera sketching like that.

1571
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:11,090
Yeah. Like, could you imagine
if you're okay. By the way,

1572
01:29:11,091 --> 01:29:12,950
I don't even even know this
was a gentleman, you know,

1573
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:15,370
Brendan cocreator of the Chappelle show.
Not a big deal.

1574
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:18,260
One of the greatest sketch comedy shows,
in my opinion,

1575
01:29:18,261 --> 01:29:20,930
the greatest in the history
of the universe. Um,

1576
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:26,110
but if you could do Chappelle show on
like HBO where you would just had full

1577
01:29:26,211 --> 01:29:30,950
reign, a hundred percent freedom.
God Damn, we kind of did though.

1578
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:34,340
We just bleep it. Sorry a
little bit. Yeah, I mean,

1579
01:29:34,341 --> 01:29:36,950
but there are certain subject matter I'm
sure that they would have probably come

1580
01:29:36,951 --> 01:29:38,990
up to you guys against.
And I know you guys,

1581
01:29:38,991 --> 01:29:43,360
I'm experienced a lot of blow back
about uh, using the word Nigger, right?

1582
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:47,990
That was not really, I mean that was
not that there was no, there was a,

1583
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:50,500
they, Dave said there was, there wasn't.

1584
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:55,010
So when Dave said that he was being
untruthful, yeah. Really? Yeah.

1585
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:55,940
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1586
01:29:56,370 --> 01:30:00,450
There was like the first season there
was like a big symposium about it with

1587
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:01,411
like should,

1588
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:06,411
it was basically Viacom was saying like
should we allow people sang it on the,

1589
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:11,160
on our air on bet,
MTV comedy central,

1590
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:16,400
and they got sort of a few
black intellectuals and
Dave and fat Joe and Walter

1591
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:23,100
Mosley and all these people to talk
about it and I so that they kind of were

1592
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:27,300
like, what should we do? And they kind
of came to the conclusion of like, yeah,

1593
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:31,500
if it's, if it contextually I set it
on comedy central the other night,

1594
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,710
my special air the other night,
I said it eight times.

1595
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:39,840
Why do you have that word eight times
and your specialist and find out then now

1596
01:30:39,841 --> 01:30:43,770
the mystery is complete.
Yeah. The suspense is in the
air. Ladies and gentleman,

1597
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:48,520
you must go to direct us seat C.
Dot com and you but download my special,

1598
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,430
which college, what's it
called? Women in black dude.

1599
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:53,750
It's women and black dudes by Neil
Brennan. Hence the use of the n word.

1600
01:30:53,810 --> 01:30:54,140
Yeah,

1601
01:30:54,140 --> 01:30:59,000
but it's about me being called it
largely right by my black friends.

1602
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:01,640
What that was like, et Cetera, et cetera.
So it's not like I'm out there like,

1603
01:31:01,641 --> 01:31:06,320
so these neurons, I'm not like going
the problem with the, you know, um,

1604
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:10,900
did that frustrate you when they were
painting that picture when Chappelle was

1605
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,670
in, in your opinion, in accurately
representing what happened? Yes.

1606
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:17,920
I've said it almost like it's
gospel because I heard him say it.

1607
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,580
No, well we've talked about it on
here. I don't, it's not what happened.

1608
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:21,743
That's not what happened.

1609
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,900
He and Dave actually watched or listened
to one of the episodes we did and he

1610
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:30,690
was like, it was interesting,
but he wasn't like, he just,

1611
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,020
that's just not what happened.
Well that's, yeah. Okay.

1612
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:39,300
I'm doing a sketch show for comedy
central now that like, but I'm not,

1613
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:40,950
I'm not worried about
being censored or anything.

1614
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:45,780
It's just a matter of that's that
type of show is hard to do because a,

1615
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:49,020
it's on NBC. They don't really, they
don't bleep stuff county central.

1616
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:52,080
You can say fucking those, bleep it.
And if they played after midnight,

1617
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:55,500
they won't believe it. Like mine aired
on midnight. I said, Fuck Shit, pussy,

1618
01:31:55,501 --> 01:32:00,070
all that shit. Um, and uh, but I'm doing
a sketch show, just a matter of like,

1619
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,230
you got good premises or not.
I think

1620
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:03,521
comedy central,

1621
01:32:03,521 --> 01:32:07,990
if any cable network is going to give
you freedom outside of HBO and showtime,

1622
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:09,160
it's going to be comedy central.
I mean,

1623
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:12,690
they have, the thing I always say
about comedy central, you know, when,

1624
01:32:12,691 --> 01:32:15,840
when Dave was saying that, that
they were, it's like, dude,

1625
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:19,470
they've only made money on subversion.
They made money.

1626
01:32:19,471 --> 01:32:21,390
They made $1 billion on south park.

1627
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:24,990
They made a 500 million on the daily show.

1628
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:27,420
Another 400 million on Cole Bear.

1629
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:31,750
Yeah. But that's not totally
accurate because I know
people who've done shows and

1630
01:32:31,751 --> 01:32:34,240
they've been pigeonholed and sensor,

1631
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:36,280
and they'd been told not
to talk about this subject.

1632
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:38,260
And then when Stan hope
and I did the man show,

1633
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,840
we encountered a lot of
resistance. I mean, it was,

1634
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:43,600
it was a real issue with
like what we wanted to do,

1635
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:46,040
especially after Janet Jackson's
nipple came out. Right.

1636
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:49,740
That literally will. Yeah. No, I know.
It's funny how big that was. Yeah.

1637
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:53,150
I never would have thought that that
was going to be a big deal at all,

1638
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,970
but it became a huge deal
with comedy central. I mean,

1639
01:32:55,971 --> 01:33:00,410
just a huge deal with everything.
Viacom, a huge deal with every network.

1640
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:01,640
How would you tell us?

1641
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:05,140
Yeah, there are 400 million
nipples in this country.

1642
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:07,510
South Park is without a doubt,

1643
01:33:07,511 --> 01:33:12,460
the most deviant show of all time
comedy central is you have to get in,

1644
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:15,870
you have to get lucky. I would say
when you look at Tosh Point, oh,

1645
01:33:15,871 --> 01:33:19,300
isn't that a perfect example? Super
deviant show. Super Hilarious.

1646
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:23,890
And you have to get in and you have to
be proven popular before they can come in

1647
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:25,360
and say like,
don't do that.

1648
01:33:25,361 --> 01:33:28,690
And you have to somehow get lucky
that they're not paying attention.

1649
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:32,160
Well, it's also, you know, like
when South Park is deviant,

1650
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:34,140
it's like they have a story,

1651
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:37,380
they have a story and you have a purpose
and there's, there's something to it,

1652
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:37,981
you know?

1653
01:33:37,981 --> 01:33:42,240
It's not like they're just trying to
put on some shock 'em rock 'em sock 'em

1654
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:42,870
shit.
Yeah.

1655
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:46,350
No, it's a narrative. It's fucking,
it's satire. It's the best. Yeah.

1656
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,670
It's just the greatest fucking show of
all time. The Mormon. Yes, it was amazing,

1657
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,650
but he's really good.
But it wasn't as good as

1658
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:55,020
they're movies. My opinion,
their best stuff is their movies.

1659
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:57,900
The a captain or a team team.
American America

1660
01:33:58,150 --> 01:34:02,560
and America is a fucking masterpiece.
One of the greatest movies of all time.

1661
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:06,390
I totally agree. And people would think
we're crazy for saying it. They're crazy.

1662
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:09,400
There are movies that God damn
piece of art. I totally agree.

1663
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,460
It's so silly and ridiculous
and it's all puppets. So what?

1664
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:15,040
You're allowed to do a lot of shit that
you can never getting out of the guy's

1665
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:19,480
chest. Oh, how about the sex
scene? You know the uncut version,

1666
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:24,020
he drops a log on her chest and
she drops along. It's unbelievable.

1667
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,790
It's what a great fucking suck my Dick.
I'm going to,

1668
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:32,140
you're going to have to suck my
dick. Okay. So yeah, the, the whole,

1669
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:36,000
the actor saving the world part of
it. Oh, fucking mad payment. Yeah.

1670
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,340
There's a weird though, cause Matt Damon
is actually smart, but I don't know.

1671
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:45,341
We know the story by why they said that
because when they came out of like the,

1672
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:49,720
the oven or whatever of the
puppet factory, they go,

1673
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:50,860
he looks retarded.

1674
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:53,080
So then they just started going
like Matt Damon and they were like,

1675
01:34:53,081 --> 01:34:58,050
let's just keep it, cause he looked
for Darren like they have nothing

1676
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:02,180
against Matt Damon. Oh well you know
the comedy without victims. Very boring.

1677
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:04,190
Right. Somebody's got to
take the head. Absolutely.

1678
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:06,200
It's gotta be Matt Damon
to make a great show.

1679
01:35:06,630 --> 01:35:08,450
It's smashing or Matt
Damon doesn't give a shit.

1680
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,200
He can't because he's not like
a pseudo intellectual like me.

1681
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:15,950
He's actually a smart guy. Smart Guy.
Very smart guy. If you hear him talk,

1682
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:19,340
you can't like pretend that he's
dumb cause then it didn't really,

1683
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:24,230
that does look really dumb
though that day man. So rude.

1684
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:28,770
Rude to poor Matt Damon.
He was good in that fucking the a,

1685
01:35:28,771 --> 01:35:32,660
the movie where he plays a super bad
guy. What does those, those movies,

1686
01:35:32,661 --> 01:35:35,640
the Bourne identity, he was
good in that. But the, the, the,

1687
01:35:35,641 --> 01:35:39,800
the new ones with Jeremy Renner,
who I think is awesome as well,

1688
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:43,490
is so over the top that they've
gone so far. There's soap,

1689
01:35:43,491 --> 01:35:47,190
like he's jumping off buildings and shit
landed on people and twist their necks

1690
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:52,210
and it's so ridiculously unbelievable as
far as like him being like that bad of

1691
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:52,950
a bat.

1692
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:55,470
Could you make this goes,
we've talked about this before.

1693
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,670
Could you make a good action movie?

1694
01:35:58,120 --> 01:36:03,120
Could Joe Rogan make a good action
movie with real fighting physics?

1695
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,720
Yes, no doubt. And it
should be, yeah, you don't,

1696
01:36:06,721 --> 01:36:09,150
you don't have to have like
ridiculous physics, you know?

1697
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:13,200
And a lot of people like this is a weird
example because a lot of people think

1698
01:36:13,201 --> 01:36:16,380
he's a ridiculous guy, but go and
watch Steven Seagal first movie,

1699
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:21,600
watch above the law. What he's
doing is all very possible. I mean,

1700
01:36:21,601 --> 01:36:23,820
he's not really doing
anything unbelievably stupid.

1701
01:36:23,821 --> 01:36:26,670
Like jumping off the top of the building
and twisting someone's neck with his

1702
01:36:26,671 --> 01:36:28,800
feet.
He's not doing anything dumb like that.

1703
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,370
What he's doing is smashing people
with pool balls, breaking their arms.

1704
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:35,400
He's doing a lot of shit.
Like I used that example.

1705
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:39,590
I went in for a meeting once they had a
general meeting. This is when I was um,

1706
01:36:40,020 --> 01:36:44,000
just getting into comedy
and uh, I was, uh,

1707
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,820
way more successful as a martial artist
than I was ever as a comedian back then.

1708
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,110
And I just gotten an agent and they were
doing some action movie and they wanted

1709
01:36:52,111 --> 01:36:55,140
to make the new Steven Seagal they wanted,
that's what their idea was.

1710
01:36:55,141 --> 01:37:00,141
Steven Seagal had done this great big
crazy movie above the law and all these

1711
01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:04,200
studios were clamoring to find the next
mark could Stevens took off for a lot of

1712
01:37:04,201 --> 01:37:05,970
people that don't realize
was a martial artist.

1713
01:37:05,971 --> 01:37:09,720
He was the first American
to a run a Dojo in Japan.

1714
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:13,710
It was respected martial artist who
was taken by whoever the fuck it was.

1715
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:17,540
Some big shot studio guy said,
we're going to make this guy movie star.

1716
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:20,900
And then so then they started looking at
all these martial arts and I went into

1717
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:23,250
this meeting, these people, and
they were talking about, you know,

1718
01:37:23,251 --> 01:37:24,770
like what can you do,
can you,

1719
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,090
you do flips and can you
do all this different shit?

1720
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,610
And they were asking questions. I
was like, look, in a real fight.

1721
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,290
That shit looks ridiculous.

1722
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:34,410
Like one of the real problems with a
lot of these martial arts movies is that

1723
01:37:34,411 --> 01:37:37,410
they look ridiculous to martial
artists go, but they don't have to.

1724
01:37:37,411 --> 01:37:41,430
And I used above the law is a perfect
example. I go that I'm a martial artist.

1725
01:37:41,431 --> 01:37:45,480
I go, that is possible. All the
stuff that he's doing is feasible.

1726
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,840
Like when you see a Jackie Chan movie,
God bless Jackie Chan,

1727
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:51,540
he's a sweetheart of a guy.
He's a very talented martial artist.

1728
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:54,930
I don't believe that God damn second
that he's jumping up and kicking two guys

1729
01:37:54,931 --> 01:37:55,920
in face at the same time.

1730
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,500
I don't, I don't believe it. Yeah.
It doesn't happen in a real fight,

1731
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:01,680
in a real fight. You, you
don't get a chance to get
punched 50 times in the face.

1732
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:04,470
A little trickle of blood comes down the
side of your mouth. It doesn't happen.

1733
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:05,430
It's not how it goes down.

1734
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:10,730
And I think that it's possible to have
a movie that is the real life physics of

1735
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:11,820
fighting and a real,

1736
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,930
a real legitimate bad motherfucker
who fights a bunch of people off or

1737
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:18,360
accomplishes something
that very difficult to do.

1738
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:22,020
But it would be your observation
that in a real fight,

1739
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:24,300
if you're finding eight guys,
they don't wait their turn,

1740
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:29,310
they jump you Paul fucking, yeah, it's
not a retard wagon train one at a time.

1741
01:38:30,910 --> 01:38:34,310
Just waiting to karate stance for you
to turn her Pov tour and you know, look,

1742
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:37,890
I'm kind of hypocritical because I love
kill bill and those are kind of silly in

1743
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:39,180
that was sort of a way,
but it was,

1744
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,500
I was willing to make that concession
with sword fighting and I was willing to

1745
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,820
make that concession and you know,

1746
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:49,350
and then there's a lot of fights with
Vivica Fox and hers kind of Real, right.

1747
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:53,070
We're pretty gangster. And so as the
one in the trailer with her and um,

1748
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,350
what's her fucking name?
It's not Vivek,

1749
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:01,050
the White Woman One I Daryl Hannah.
Thank you Darryl Hannah.

1750
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:03,990
That was pretty bad ass one of the
trailer when they're duking it out in the

1751
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:05,280
trail and she pulls her other eye out.

1752
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:12,420
That fucking movie was bad ass. But,
but I just, as a martial artist,

1753
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:16,140
I understand what real fights look like
and I get upset when I see some shit.

1754
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:20,490
That's just ridiculous. It wouldn't work.
Yeah, I probably shouldn't know. I know.

1755
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:22,590
I mean,
I'm just wondering if that could be,

1756
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:27,540
you know that Steven Seagal movie came
out in [inaudible] 88 you could make that

1757
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:30,810
movie today exactly the same way. Just
make it a little bit more, you know,

1758
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:34,410
updated for the Times that movie could
be done today if he was as young as he

1759
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:38,130
was back then. And this is physically
adapt as he was back then and slim.

1760
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:43,230
He was very slim. Yeah. Yeah.
I just wonder if everything's
has supercharged now.

1761
01:39:43,231 --> 01:39:46,740
It's like, could you, yeah, you could
do it. It just would have to be good.

1762
01:39:46,920 --> 01:39:48,530
The whole thing is just,
here's a perfect example.

1763
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:51,210
Do you play any musical
instruments? No, I don't either.

1764
01:39:51,390 --> 01:39:54,480
So when I watch a guy who's doing
like a guitar solo in a movie,

1765
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,190
he could be bullshitting.

1766
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:59,700
I don't know if I'm watching like some
guys playing Jimi Hendrix and he's just

1767
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:01,860
randomly doing things.
I don't know what he's doing.

1768
01:40:01,910 --> 01:40:05,130
I have no idea what he's doing so,
but if Eddie Bravo watches it,

1769
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,730
he a Bravo knows how to play guitar.
He'll be like, that guy is bullshit. Yeah.

1770
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:12,480
Also their fingers don't match. Exactly.
This is nonsense. That's how it is to me.

1771
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:15,900
When I watch some guy who's just jumping
up and kicking a bunch of people and

1772
01:40:15,901 --> 01:40:17,510
doing a bunch of stupid shit,
that would never happen.

1773
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:18,960
It was like a standup movies.
The same thing.

1774
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:23,360
You Watch punchline just like thank
you very much. Perfect example.

1775
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:26,820
But you watched funny people and you're
like, that's pretty much like stand up,

1776
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:27,690
right?
Yeah.

1777
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:31,590
Punchline was a very interesting movie
because it got a lot of people into stand,

1778
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:34,500
standup comedy and,
but you remember when they had lockers?

1779
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,130
Tom Hanks and Sally
lockers like a locker room.

1780
01:40:38,131 --> 01:40:40,880
When you go back and change like
this isn't a strip club. Okay.

1781
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:43,920
It's a guy named comedy club. If
you're lucky. They have a green room.

1782
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:48,290
Give me my lucky mic. Yeah, where's my,
yeah, if you lucky. They have a great,

1783
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,250
did you have a lucky Mike?
No, but he might as well.

1784
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:54,100
He might as well like
that's how realistic it was.

1785
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,280
Yeah. That movie was not
legit. That was non legit,

1786
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:59,220
but it got people interested in comedy.

1787
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:01,510
I think a lot of people got into
comedy because of that movie.

1788
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:06,640
Fans are comedians. People who wanted
to be a comedian after they saw that,

1789
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,130
like at one a good movie like that.

1790
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:13,600
Like I'm a movie like like rocky and
many people will start boxing after this

1791
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,350
year.
Rocky.

1792
01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:18,760
You know how many people started playing
pool that joke with that many people

1793
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:22,270
that talks to medially after
rocket? Yes, that's right. Italians.

1794
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:24,910
He did a whole bit about Italians.
Which is dead on the money,

1795
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:29,110
which is so fucking funny. That bit
way before Jersey shore, he nailed it.

1796
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:31,310
The punchline is the
Moodle going to pay for it?

1797
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,620
Uh, I mean a movie about anything where
it's really awesome and it's, it becomes,

1798
01:41:38,621 --> 01:41:41,860
well I haven't seen any of those military
movies where it's like sponsored by

1799
01:41:41,861 --> 01:41:45,490
the military. Well was lone
survivor. Anybody see that?

1800
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:48,080
Very good. I haven't seen it, but
it's supposed to be very good. Um,

1801
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,270
it might not be sponsored by,

1802
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:53,570
but they certainly have to get approval
and then when they're portraying certain

1803
01:41:53,571 --> 01:41:55,910
events or people they have
to get approval. Yeah.

1804
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:57,460
But these are like into,

1805
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,040
I kind of have a thing right now where
I'm kind of anti war movies where I'm

1806
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:05,190
just like,
it just feels like endorsing violence.

1807
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:06,410
Well,
it kind of does,

1808
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:10,780
but then it's also a legitimate form
of a genre of entertainment and yeah,

1809
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:15,810
I'd always will be. You know,
war movies are always going
to be, you know, starting,

1810
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:18,380
that's an aspect of life.
As long as it's this aspect of life,

1811
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:20,030
there's going to be fascinating war movie.

1812
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:25,160
How many guys, percentage do you
think guys that are in combat,

1813
01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:30,440
Iraq, Afghanistan, World War II, Korea,

1814
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:35,350
Vietnam are there,
their life is kind of fucked afterward.

1815
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:40,370
Percentage wise. Wow. You know,
as a person who's never served,

1816
01:42:40,371 --> 01:42:42,410
pts never wore all that shit.

1817
01:42:42,411 --> 01:42:44,780
I would be ridiculous to try
to give you a percentage.

1818
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:49,160
I think it's pretty high though. I think
it's gotta be 40, 50, whatever it is.

1819
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,300
Even if it's one guy, it's too many.
That's what I mean. It's so decimating.

1820
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,130
Yeah.

1821
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:58,810
I mean it's also something that we as
civilians sitting here talking on this

1822
01:42:58,811 --> 01:42:59,950
podcast could never really,

1823
01:42:59,951 --> 01:43:04,010
totally appreciate how devastating it
must be to be an 18 year old guy and also

1824
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:07,630
in to find yourself over there and then
come back and try to reenter life after

1825
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:12,580
dealing with six years of war
and craziness and Afghanistan
or, or what have you.

1826
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,710
Um,
a lot of them get fucked up.

1827
01:43:14,711 --> 01:43:19,000
You know what's really wrong is that they
don't have nearly as much help as they

1828
01:43:19,001 --> 01:43:23,440
should. And like, one of the things that
we do for the, at the UFC is we, um,

1829
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:27,760
we put on these fights for the
troops and we put them on for, um,

1830
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:30,850
it's for the intrepid center
of excellence, which is a,

1831
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:35,470
a center to treat traumatic brain
injury and they need money, man.

1832
01:43:35,471 --> 01:43:37,510
They need money all the time.
And, but it's, it's incredible.

1833
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:39,930
They have money for all these weapons.
They have money for all this. Yeah.

1834
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:43,290
You know, sending troops over there,
they have money to give them guns.

1835
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:47,530
They have money for all this, these
drones and crazy surveillance technology.

1836
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:51,680
But they have to raise money from
the public to treat these people with

1837
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:52,693
traumatic,

1838
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:57,520
something that's as big a problem if
not a, it's a much longer term problem.

1839
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:00,970
Then having a,
it's like you need a gun for two years.

1840
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:05,620
You need mental health coverage or a month
or healthcare sometimes for 60 years.

1841
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:09,880
Yeah. And that's honestly, wives kind
of soured on war movies cause I'm like,

1842
01:44:09,881 --> 01:44:14,350
I just don't want to fucking
endorsed this. It's like
it's this decimates people.

1843
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,740
Yeah, it certainly does.
There's no doubt about that.

1844
01:44:16,741 --> 01:44:21,300
But I think that if you want
to get people to be patriotic,

1845
01:44:21,301 --> 01:44:26,130
if you want to enforce the idea that
these people were over there fighting so

1846
01:44:26,131 --> 01:44:30,090
that we can enjoy freedom and safety here.
If that's the narrative,

1847
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:31,890
then God dammit,

1848
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:34,020
you better take care of those
fucking people when they come back.

1849
01:44:34,050 --> 01:44:38,220
And if you're not, then, then it makes me
feel like there's some shenanigans foot.

1850
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:40,080
You know, you're, you're
fucking around here. Why?

1851
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:44,310
You're not really thinking about the
health and safety of the people because

1852
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:47,040
you're not thinking about the health
and safety of the very people that put

1853
01:44:47,041 --> 01:44:50,010
their lives in danger to do it.
So what is the real game here?

1854
01:44:50,011 --> 01:44:51,780
Where is the Rear Ma real motivation?

1855
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:54,210
Are you trying to save money
by not funding this stuff?

1856
01:44:54,211 --> 01:44:58,740
Like why is there not more
money automatically going
in to take care of these

1857
01:44:58,741 --> 01:45:02,220
people if they really are
representing good? It's a fucking,

1858
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:03,780
it's a dirty trick.

1859
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:07,440
It's a dirty trick that patriotism
because it ropes in a lot of heroes.

1860
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:10,630
Everyone all in. A lot of that's
for legitimate heroes who get used.

1861
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:15,500
And you also hear guys that feel like they
get the switcheroo pulled on. Oh yeah.

1862
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:18,020
Where you think it's got,
I mean, I think you could,

1863
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:21,500
you could trick an 18 year old into
anything. You know what I mean?

1864
01:45:21,550 --> 01:45:24,490
Well, Pat Tillman the whole story.
Pat Tillman is a perfect example.

1865
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,580
If you don't know that story, Pat
Tillman was a, it's a great documentary,

1866
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:30,880
by the way. What's it called? The
Tillman store. I haven't seen it.

1867
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:34,910
Oh Dude. It's fucking, his brother's
in it. His family. It's amazing.

1868
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,070
I'll see you tonight. Yeah, fuck it. Um,

1869
01:45:37,330 --> 01:45:41,830
but Tillman is a fantastic story because
that's a perfect example of a real hero

1870
01:45:41,831 --> 01:45:43,660
who got roped into something.
I mean,

1871
01:45:43,661 --> 01:45:48,310
that guy was a NFL quarterback or an NFL
football player who was a star player

1872
01:45:48,311 --> 01:45:52,690
with a fucking perfect face.
Beautiful genetics is full.

1873
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:57,520
All American man who blowing thick hair,
perfect alpha male.

1874
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:02,530
So he realizes that the United States
has been attacked and decides that it

1875
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:05,980
being a football player is bullshit.
What I want to do is defend my country.

1876
01:46:05,981 --> 01:46:10,780
He's a real hero, goes over to
Afghanistan and finds a luster. Fuck.

1877
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:11,100
Yeah.

1878
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:16,030
Just an unbelievable cluster
fuck criticizes it openly
and is ultimately killed

1879
01:46:16,031 --> 01:46:20,500
in friendly fire in it. His last words
were, I'm fucking Pat Tillman. Allegedly.

1880
01:46:20,530 --> 01:46:25,210
Yeah. And then he gets shot
by, by US troops. Like the
whole thing is a disaster.

1881
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:28,870
Right. And um, his brother
has openly spoke about that,

1882
01:46:28,871 --> 01:46:33,760
about how angry they were at pat for
being so critical and openly critical.

1883
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,370
It's a crazy story,
but it's a story.

1884
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:39,430
Ultimately the real tragedy
is not just the loss of life,

1885
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:40,480
which is of course tragic,

1886
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:44,440
but that a real hero got
roped into something stupid.

1887
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:49,180
A real hero got roped into this situation
where it wasn't organized correctly.

1888
01:46:49,190 --> 01:46:52,720
Where was all this chaos, which is just,
you're going to have in war anyway. Yeah.

1889
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:57,450
According to him it was terrible.
So they, they got a real hero and,

1890
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:00,480
and got them stuck in
this terrible quagmire.

1891
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:03,510
Yeah. But I don't think he's
any more heroic than any,

1892
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:08,000
any other kid who enlists of course. You
know what I mean? Like course not. But,

1893
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:09,990
and then they get over there
and they're like, oh, this is,

1894
01:47:10,050 --> 01:47:13,110
this is more way more like a
prison than I thought it would be.

1895
01:47:13,190 --> 01:47:14,960
Well,
of course he's not any more heroic.

1896
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:18,020
But what's great about that
story is he had already achieved,

1897
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:22,460
want go looking for millionaire.
He's a star athlete,

1898
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,200
he's in the Goddamn NFL.

1899
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:27,910
And then he decides to go overseas and
ultimately loses his life. You know,

1900
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,600
that's the reality of war.

1901
01:47:29,601 --> 01:47:34,010
And that's what I think a lot of us miss
on the outside when you're looking at

1902
01:47:34,011 --> 01:47:37,580
it as far as like a, a, a creative
narrative as far as, you know,

1903
01:47:37,581 --> 01:47:41,660
looking at it as like a movie, looking
at it. And you know, I mean the, the,

1904
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:45,560
the movie, the market mark movies actually
based on a real guy, Marcus with trail,

1905
01:47:45,770 --> 01:47:49,910
lone survivor. It was,
apparently the book's amazing.
So it's based on a real guy

1906
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:54,970
and he's decimated. He's got PTSD,
he's got, he's, I mean he's his,

1907
01:47:54,971 --> 01:47:58,980
his, his, he's got some severe
mental health, a nice guy.
I met him saying nothing.

1908
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:02,770
I bet. Yeah, I met him a couple times in
the UFC. He's a very nice guy. You know,

1909
01:48:02,771 --> 01:48:05,560
there's a program where you can leave
tickets from military to do that.

1910
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:08,770
Leave tickets. You can set up.
Kathy Grover told me about this.

1911
01:48:08,771 --> 01:48:12,670
There's a thing where you can set aside
a however many tickets for your shows

1912
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:17,620
and donate them to military guys and
then they can decide what shows they want

1913
01:48:17,621 --> 01:48:21,580
to go to. Really. Yeah. And
I can't remember the name of
it. Tell me after the show.

1914
01:48:22,070 --> 01:48:24,660
I'll text. Yeah, that sounds great.
That sounds like a great idea. Yeah,

1915
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:29,440
it's probably a good idea to set aside
some for poor students to, you know,

1916
01:48:29,441 --> 01:48:32,830
I totally agree. Yeah. You know,
good idea you do on Broadway.

1917
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:37,960
Some for girls who can't get laid, you
know, where does it end, Joe? I Dunno.

1918
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:41,710
Probably like a old lady. She
yell, don't give them tickets.

1919
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:47,020
Hit to get to
get to a certain group and caught him off.

1920
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:48,033
You know?

1921
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:52,050
So while your specials out now
it's a, you can download it. Yeah.

1922
01:48:52,120 --> 01:48:56,760
Comedy central.com. direct.cc a first
special ever. First special. And you know,

1923
01:48:56,761 --> 01:49:00,700
a lot of people don't know. You were
really wearing a standup comic? No.

1924
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:02,550
And you decided that night decided

1925
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:06,840
six, six and a half years
ago. What made you decide, uh,

1926
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:10,380
just cause you just get told that if
you're writing, well first of all,

1927
01:49:10,381 --> 01:49:13,320
there's a couple of things.
If you're co, you know,

1928
01:49:13,350 --> 01:49:18,320
Showbiz and comedy is like a
bit of a caste system in the,

1929
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:22,350
in the medieval sense,
like there are stars,

1930
01:49:22,620 --> 01:49:27,600
the comedians and then there are like
below that there's writers and if you're

1931
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:32,250
just a writer, you're,
you're hoping, you're like,

1932
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:34,920
hey, it's a lot of
like, what do you think?

1933
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:39,210
You never really get to decide you're you,
it's just this all,

1934
01:49:39,211 --> 01:49:42,180
you're always looking up.
So I just was like, and,

1935
01:49:42,181 --> 01:49:47,181
and then there's also the thing of stars
get more power just to get projects

1936
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:49,540
made, what they want to do, et
Cetera, et cetera. So I was like,

1937
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:54,570
I'd rather take a shot at being on camera
then constantly having to be trying to

1938
01:49:56,171 --> 01:50:00,730
convince studios that I'm funny or trying
to convince a performer that this is a

1939
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:02,410
good joke.
Or,

1940
01:50:02,411 --> 01:50:05,020
and also the thing with day was like
we were in a partnership and then I

1941
01:50:05,021 --> 01:50:07,960
realized like, oh,
partnerships are fleeting.

1942
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:12,630
So Matt and Trey are
great. Yeah, yeah. Uh,

1943
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:14,740
but they can be fleeting.
So I was like,

1944
01:50:14,741 --> 01:50:16,240
let me just try to do some shit on my own.

1945
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:20,380
And the standups been good for that and
I'm doing a couple of pilots and people

1946
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:21,214
are paying attention.

1947
01:50:21,370 --> 01:50:22,420
Good for you dude.
You know,

1948
01:50:22,421 --> 01:50:25,360
it's cool to see someone who's smart
who figured that out, who just said,

1949
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:27,700
you know what, I could do this too. And
I've always said that to people. Like,

1950
01:50:27,970 --> 01:50:30,610
you know, people say, oh, I
can never be a comedian. Well,

1951
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:33,340
if you never could be a comedian,
you can never be a comedian.

1952
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:36,010
But there are some people that could be
a comedian that just don't ever do it.

1953
01:50:36,011 --> 01:50:37,210
And a lot of them are writers.

1954
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:40,920
There's a lot of really funny writers
that just don't, they just don't,

1955
01:50:41,290 --> 01:50:44,790
and it's funny with
writers, writers, Simi,

1956
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:50,010
they almost talk to me like a runaway
slave. You made a cross a line.

1957
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:53,550
I was making that joke with a buddy.
My Buddy Alex pays,

1958
01:50:53,551 --> 01:50:56,730
who's like the best writer on weekend
update and he's going with Seth to the new

1959
01:50:56,731 --> 01:51:00,530
show and he writes like all of Amy and
Tina Shit and the Oscars and the and

1960
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:01,620
knowledge and he's fucking great writer.

1961
01:51:01,800 --> 01:51:04,650
He wrote that intro for
at the Golden Globes.

1962
01:51:05,190 --> 01:51:09,630
It was an intro for Leonardo
Dicaprio. It was a, and like a,

1963
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:13,170
a uh, a supermodels. Vagina.

1964
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:16,170
Please give a warm welcome
to Leonardo Dicaprio.

1965
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:20,490
He's a fucking hilarious guy.
Bays craze on Twitter.

1966
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,310
Bay's crazy.
Be a z and then craze,

1967
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:31,320
c r a. Z. E. Nice. Um,
but he, we were joking,

1968
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:35,070
he was the other day where it was like,
you ain't never going to be nothing.

1969
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:39,480
They might let you shoot a pre tape. You
may you direct something, but fuck that.

1970
01:51:39,481 --> 01:51:40,680
That's all you,
that's as far as you're going to get.

1971
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:44,790
Like there's just a thing with writers
where we feel like we're, and it's like,

1972
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:47,850
no, it's like, I'll be on shows
with a bunch of comedians.

1973
01:51:47,851 --> 01:51:51,330
I'll do just as well as them and they'll
throw deals at them and I'm kind of

1974
01:51:51,331 --> 01:51:55,980
like, why did we just got the same
response? What are you talking about?

1975
01:51:55,981 --> 01:51:59,650
I'll be on like showcases at the
laugh factory. Yeah, laugh factory,

1976
01:51:59,690 --> 01:52:03,390
the empire or whatever, and
for the longest time I do
just as well as everybody,

1977
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:06,540
but like showbiz would be
like, well, you don't really,

1978
01:52:06,541 --> 01:52:09,750
you're not really a comedian because you
know how to write and direct. It's like,

1979
01:52:09,780 --> 01:52:14,550
no, I'm just as much a comedian as
pretend I can't write and direct.

1980
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:19,290
I did just as well as this guy
that you want to have on your show.

1981
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:23,400
I, but you understand that when someone
is appealing in a certain way that they

1982
01:52:23,401 --> 01:52:24,390
want to put them on a show,

1983
01:52:24,391 --> 01:52:27,780
they might be different than you and
they might be looking for a specific time

1984
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:31,220
that you know that's a real issue that
comics have was like, what about me? Yeah,

1985
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:34,110
I might not getting mine. Well,
they don't have a place for you.

1986
01:52:34,111 --> 01:52:35,280
They're not interested in you.

1987
01:52:35,281 --> 01:52:39,870
They don't find you to be compelling
data sitting in this role.

1988
01:52:39,871 --> 01:52:41,100
Then the lily is young,

1989
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:44,880
cute guy that happens to be gay and
he's going to play a sitcom character.

1990
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:46,123
You're not that guy.

1991
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:51,210
The people that have had a lot of
success, like Louie, Tina Fey there.

1992
01:52:51,300 --> 01:52:54,620
Pete people weren't Larry.
David people weren't casting them,

1993
01:52:55,860 --> 01:52:58,950
but they don't have to see this
idea of like you have to be,

1994
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:02,970
the beautiful thing about being a standup
is all you'd have to do is do what

1995
01:53:02,971 --> 01:53:05,780
you're already doing a grade.
That's the beautiful thing about it.

1996
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,930
It frees you from this weird system
where you're constantly auditioning for

1997
01:53:09,931 --> 01:53:13,000
things. Yeah, and hoping and praying
to get accepted and then, yeah,

1998
01:53:13,140 --> 01:53:15,300
I think that fucks with
people's heads too, man.

1999
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,520
I don't think it's good to
get rejected all the time,

2000
01:53:17,521 --> 01:53:19,130
especially when you're
unbelievably insecure.

2001
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:22,880
That's the thing is I would have movie
ideas or jokes and they'd be like, no,

2002
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:25,990
that's not funny, and I'd be
like, I think that's funny. Yeah.

2003
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:28,450
I'm going to go to a comedy
club and test that out.

2004
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,710
Well think about half the shit you guys
did on the Chappelle show and trying to

2005
01:53:31,711 --> 01:53:33,000
pitch those things,
like

2006
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:33,980
trying to bomb.

2007
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:37,560
I remember pitching before we started the
show and they pitch and they'd be like,

2008
01:53:37,650 --> 01:53:39,340
the fuck are you talking about?
It's hilarious.

2009
01:53:39,390 --> 01:53:43,140
What are you talking like just constantly
like Chapelle has a theory that you

2010
01:53:43,141 --> 01:53:46,740
can never,
a joke never works.

2011
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:51,430
A standup joke is never works
during the day to people.

2012
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:56,160
You know what I mean?
That's what good does it work?

2013
01:53:56,161 --> 01:53:59,940
Telling it to someone during the day,
which is like kind of true.

2014
01:53:59,941 --> 01:54:01,500
Like you just have to try,

2015
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:06,600
you have to work it out and then
you have to go try it. Uh, but,

2016
01:54:06,630 --> 01:54:10,830
but yeah, so it's like figuring out, it's
like, it's like standup is the, it's the,

2017
01:54:10,831 --> 01:54:12,840
it's a leveler where you just go like,
no,

2018
01:54:12,841 --> 01:54:16,910
I think I'm pretty good and I'm
going to go test that out. And yeah,

2019
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:19,920
it definitely gives you
an avenue that you don't,

2020
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:21,990
you don't need other people's
acceptance and approval.

2021
01:54:21,991 --> 01:54:24,060
And when you're trying
to create something,

2022
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:27,110
generating something
where a piece of artwork,

2023
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:31,170
a comedy sketch and thinking about someone
else's approval while you're doing it

2024
01:54:31,171 --> 01:54:33,690
is the kiss of death.
You don't want to think about that.

2025
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,050
You just want to think what does Neal
Brennan think is funny. How do I do?

2026
01:54:37,051 --> 01:54:39,990
And that's the beautiful thing about
doing stand up. You can do that.

2027
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:44,620
You can do that. Ready?
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Neil Brennan. Yeah,

2028
01:54:44,640 --> 01:54:46,890
you go on stage and that's all you man.

2029
01:54:46,891 --> 01:54:49,950
You don't have to worry about
passing things through producers.

2030
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:51,630
Fruit by the network.

2031
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:53,530
Okay. Think of it. And the
other thing is different.

2032
01:54:53,531 --> 01:54:57,190
Tween standup and movies and TV shows.
I can think of a joke right now.

2033
01:54:57,700 --> 01:55:00,130
Tell it tonight and know
if it's good or not.

2034
01:55:00,610 --> 01:55:04,460
Whereas I think of a joke
for a movie, it'll be a year
and a half. Oh yeah, Friday.

2035
01:55:04,461 --> 01:55:05,950
No,
it fit even kind of works.

2036
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,710
You know there's a real problem too in
that comics for for whatever reason it's,

2037
01:55:10,711 --> 01:55:11,820
and it's all because of money.

2038
01:55:11,970 --> 01:55:15,090
We thought they thought that
you have to do something else.

2039
01:55:15,150 --> 01:55:19,170
You have to do for awhile as a city. For
some guys it was the talk show. Yeah.

2040
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:21,770
They,
they were in it to get in,

2041
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:25,170
to use it as a means to an end instead
of like really enjoying it for what it

2042
01:55:25,171 --> 01:55:26,850
actually is.
It's just an amazing

2043
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:30,090
Saint Epson incredible thing, man. That's
the thing that people don't realize.

2044
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:33,940
It's like you're part preacher, you're
part philosopher, you're part clown.

2045
01:55:33,970 --> 01:55:35,320
It's like so many things.

2046
01:55:35,321 --> 01:55:39,490
You can change people's thought process
in a way that you can't in very many

2047
01:55:39,491 --> 01:55:42,640
ways and you're going SAS,
it's great

2048
01:55:42,810 --> 01:55:44,070
you can them and I'm one

2049
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,720
of the most powerful forms ever,

2050
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:49,590
like a good comic on stage killing to
me is still the favorite thing I like to

2051
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:52,110
watch is my most enjoyable thing to,

2052
01:55:52,111 --> 01:55:55,500
to sit there and take in
because it's just the,

2053
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:59,370
the feeling that you get from laughing
your fucking ass off at a great standup.

2054
01:55:59,570 --> 01:56:03,220
Do you don't really get that from a lot
of other places. No. It's also visceral.

2055
01:56:03,221 --> 01:56:07,780
It's that like person on person and
I think that's, that's more, uh,

2056
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,580
needed.
I think.

2057
01:56:09,581 --> 01:56:14,530
Like the reason Stanhope stone better
like culturally is because everything's so

2058
01:56:14,531 --> 01:56:17,410
like isolated and you can just
download everything and it's like, no.

2059
01:56:17,411 --> 01:56:22,411
A person in front of you doing
something is really vital and I think

2060
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:25,560
even more vital when you're
in a small club. Yeah.

2061
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:30,400
I think I do a lot of larger places lately
and I enjoy them because it's like a

2062
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:31,750
more powerful experience.

2063
01:56:31,751 --> 01:56:35,280
Like when I'm doing the Chicago theater
Friday and it'd be like 3,400 people on

2064
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:38,810
that. Yeah. And when you're on stage and
3,400 people are screaming and laughing,

2065
01:56:38,811 --> 01:56:41,760
it's take theater. Woo. It's
a crackling feeling then.

2066
01:56:41,770 --> 01:56:45,430
But you know what else is bad ass?
The God little room at the Ice House,

2067
01:56:45,431 --> 01:56:49,560
that 80 seat room. Woo. That's
a great fucking room, man. Yeah.

2068
01:56:49,780 --> 01:56:54,400
That little room stuffed with
people is so intimate and so alive.

2069
01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:57,070
It's almost the better form of comedy.

2070
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,320
It's almost the better
form as an audience member.

2071
01:56:59,321 --> 01:57:01,450
And the better form is
a PR as a performer,

2072
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:03,760
you're intimate with all those 80 people,
man.

2073
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:08,330
Yeah. It goes back to the dog smelling
thing. It's not like it's all right

2074
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:09,210
right there.

2075
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:11,970
Here's something for people don't know
about dogs and their powerful sense of

2076
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:13,420
smells is a perfect way to,

2077
01:57:13,460 --> 01:57:17,310
to kind of sense it or to get it in
your head because a lot of people go,

2078
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:20,670
oh well dogs can smell x parts per
million, you know, and they really can't.

2079
01:57:20,671 --> 01:57:23,370
That's how they track people.
Skunks, skunks are one,

2080
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:27,810
a few animals that human beings have the
ability to smell in a small parts per

2081
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:31,140
million. I was that true?
Yeah. That's why when skunks,

2082
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:34,240
skunk smell is so potent to us that uh,

2083
01:57:34,241 --> 01:57:36,640
Scott could be like a block
away and squirt someone,

2084
01:57:36,660 --> 01:57:39,950
you'll fucking smell it clear as day.
This is nothing a block away.

2085
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,600
It's like a little, uh,
little dog shit thing.

2086
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:44,850
Scored something out and the
little tiny amount. Yeah.

2087
01:57:44,990 --> 01:57:49,310
I wonder why that is evolutionarily.
Probably to keep this Chicago alive.

2088
01:57:50,090 --> 01:57:52,220
What's that? Software updates. Yeah.

2089
01:57:52,221 --> 01:57:55,580
They updated the shit out of that o s
till it got to the point where they had

2090
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:58,590
the most devastating antiviral
software error, I'm sure.

2091
01:57:58,591 --> 01:58:03,030
Just trying to think like
who is it benefiting? It's
benefiting. Keeps this and,

2092
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:07,340
but the fact that humans can smell
it so well, keep away from them.

2093
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,170
We were horrified by it,

2094
01:58:09,230 --> 01:58:12,800
so they hit the tune that we also evolved.

2095
01:58:13,070 --> 01:58:15,020
It's like the version of a dog whistle.

2096
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:19,010
It's a smell version of a dog whistle.
You blow a dog whistle. Dogs can hear it.

2097
01:58:19,011 --> 01:58:19,844
People can't.

2098
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:24,880
That smell is like they hit the right
tune where we're like that fucking shitty

2099
01:58:25,581 --> 01:58:28,150
smell that comes out of there. But
we're like, whoa. It's like the

2100
01:58:28,410 --> 01:58:31,320
perfect smell.
So you think human beings,

2101
01:58:31,350 --> 01:58:36,350
do you think that will ever evolve out
of that smell of not caring about that

2102
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,550
smell?
The only way that would be possible.

2103
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:42,130
It was a skunks were fucking delicious.
Skunks tasted like lobster.

2104
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:43,690
If every school, it was like, yeah,

2105
01:58:43,691 --> 01:58:46,060
you got to shoot them before
they blast you with the stink.

2106
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:49,780
But if you can get a head shot on him,
God damn, they're delicious. Yeah,

2107
01:58:49,820 --> 01:58:53,920
like little crabs. They're like stone
crabs. Yeah, no, you're probably right.

2108
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:56,630
And then we would figure out a way,
million, it would take millions of years.

2109
01:58:56,700 --> 01:58:58,630
Take a long time.
We get there.

2110
01:58:58,970 --> 01:59:01,870
Who is thinking about the things that
have happened and what are the odds of

2111
01:59:01,871 --> 01:59:03,850
them evolving? Like the
Angler fish, the fish.

2112
01:59:03,851 --> 01:59:07,720
There's a fucking fishing pole grown out
of his head and a little word dangling

2113
01:59:07,721 --> 01:59:12,040
in front of it and a fish sees that
Laura and then gets, gets eat. Ah, fuck.

2114
01:59:12,041 --> 01:59:12,970
Did that evolve?
Yeah.

2115
01:59:13,120 --> 01:59:16,480
Do you ever see that pull that
pull a video of an angler fish up?

2116
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:19,930
That is one of the weirdest
things in all of nature,

2117
01:59:19,931 --> 01:59:23,740
that nature figured out a God damn
fishing pole before people did. Yeah.

2118
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:27,930
I mean a person invented a
fishing pole because they go, hmm,

2119
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:30,820
I need to figure out how to get over
there in the water and drop this down.

2120
01:59:30,940 --> 01:59:35,110
Look at this God damn thing. It's got
a fishing rod grown out of its face.

2121
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:40,510
This is one of the weirdest,
silliest things ever. Oh,

2122
01:59:40,511 --> 01:59:42,610
this is just a bunch of
different weird things, man.

2123
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:46,960
She should just find one that's just
an angler fish killing a angler,

2124
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:48,610
fish killing and other fish.
It's,

2125
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:53,080
it's so bizarre because they trick the
fish to coming close because if it's

2126
01:59:53,081 --> 01:59:53,914
fishing rod,

2127
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:57,820
it's got to lure and the end of its
face and then the fish comes in and gets

2128
01:59:57,821 --> 02:00:00,190
eaten somehow or another through.

2129
02:00:00,430 --> 02:00:04,360
And it's amazing that they did that
in the 6,000 years since the Bible was

2130
02:00:04,361 --> 02:00:07,750
written less than 10 for sure.
I mean that's what the Bible says.

2131
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,690
That's fucking in that amazing.
Yeah, and it's amazing.

2132
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:15,430
It's amazing how many people believe
that less a 47% of Republicans,

2133
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:19,570
46% of people in a recent Gallup
poll said they believe the,

2134
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:23,020
in the biblical creation version
of look at that. There it is,

2135
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:26,440
which means that the earth is
less than 10,000 years old.

2136
02:00:26,441 --> 02:00:30,690
See it sitting here like this
and then watch is a little fish,

2137
02:00:30,691 --> 02:00:34,230
all of their soccer and m to do in that.
That's a fish on a stick,

2138
02:00:35,410 --> 02:00:39,030
but check it out when his
little thing comes up. Oh,

2139
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:41,730
this is new moon shot is that
thing on his forehead. Yeah.

2140
02:00:41,750 --> 02:00:46,380
That's the lore and it comes out
here once you vet these in advance.

2141
02:00:46,381 --> 02:00:49,740
So I don't have to sit here
pulling our decks, get to see,

2142
02:00:49,770 --> 02:00:52,350
get them to use that God damn thing.
You use your thing. You fuck you're,

2143
02:00:53,340 --> 02:00:56,670
you're making me look bad kid.
This is my friend.

2144
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:01,740
This is your video. There he is. There
he is. Look at that. Shaking it. Look,

2145
02:01:01,741 --> 02:01:06,060
he's tricking him. He's trying to trick
them with his lore. That's a bad example.

2146
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:08,280
This, I'm sure there's a way
better video than that online.

2147
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:11,040
Now you know how we felt when we
play the Drake video? I understand,

2148
02:01:11,041 --> 02:01:14,400
but you saw the Drake video. I didn't see
that. There's one out there. That's good.

2149
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:18,090
Yeah, but we memorized it. I
mean we had, we had in our head,

2150
02:01:18,091 --> 02:01:20,400
we wanted to please your
job. Don't you say? Well,

2151
02:01:20,401 --> 02:01:24,120
there's so many animals that like how,
how does a certain animal develop?

2152
02:01:24,121 --> 02:01:26,150
It's called how's the leopard developed?

2153
02:01:26,151 --> 02:01:29,860
It's wild skin with it's fucking
amazing. What does that, why is,

2154
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:32,590
why is that there? You know,
why? Why does, uh, you know,

2155
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:34,320
why does a tarpon look like that?

2156
02:01:34,321 --> 02:01:38,550
Why did you know my name
is fucking strange animals
that live on this earth. LF.

2157
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:41,670
Yeah. All giraffes. Elephants.
Yeah. It's fun. It's crazy.

2158
02:01:41,671 --> 02:01:45,410
At 6,000 years it didn't take long
for God. I mean it's quick. Yeah.

2159
02:01:45,530 --> 02:01:49,670
Well one year the Lord, you've got that
kind of power guy that got it. Yeah. Yeah.

2160
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:52,880
That's funny that that's like,
that can get you in trouble.

2161
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:54,230
Like if you were on a show,

2162
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:57,560
like say if you on an NBC show
and she started mocking the Bible,

2163
02:01:57,650 --> 02:01:59,340
there'd be a bunch of groups.
That was a problem.

2164
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,710
The,
you know what's funny though is it's the,

2165
02:02:01,711 --> 02:02:03,480
and I've been talking about this
and a lot of like, it's that guy.

2166
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:07,020
It's that Gotcha Shit. Or like, hey NBC,

2167
02:02:07,290 --> 02:02:09,350
I heard Neil Brennan and Joe Rogan.

2168
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:14,150
We're talking about God you might want to
do so. I was like eight times. Exactly.

2169
02:02:14,160 --> 02:02:15,690
Really wants to know what's funny though.

2170
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,660
I only only free people
objected on Twitter.

2171
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:22,620
Well it's just this, you don't have a
lot of followers. She had more followers.

2172
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:26,040
How many followers? I think I got
challenged this fucking guy. Challenges.

2173
02:02:26,610 --> 02:02:31,610
I'd say you have at least
200,000 you're good to 38 yeah.

2174
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:35,970
There you go. I here. That's
a lot of followers. It's
very good. That's very good.

2175
02:02:36,330 --> 02:02:41,310
But people don't pay attention
to you generally that's
what's going on. They say,

2176
02:02:41,311 --> 02:02:44,170
oh it's Neil tweet and I just
pass over that. I only follow them

2177
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:48,270
fucking, I don't want to fall
black dates close enough.

2178
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:52,800
Yeah, he's, he's the the bridge.
Neal Brennan's the bridge. Yeah.

2179
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:55,840
People love to complain about Shit Man.
Whether it's valid or not,

2180
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:57,750
they love to get people on things.
Well,

2181
02:02:57,810 --> 02:03:00,790
I always say it's way easier to do that
then fucking actually do something.

2182
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:04,660
It certainly is and you know it's also
is weird to 38 ladies and gentlemen

2183
02:03:04,690 --> 02:03:08,290
almost to 39 we can get
it to two 39 by the way.

2184
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:14,260
Neil Brennan with n e n e a l B r e n.

2185
02:03:14,261 --> 02:03:18,580
N. A. N. Go there, follow
him. Show him the love.

2186
02:03:18,581 --> 02:03:21,700
Can we see this happen in real time?
Ladies and gentleman,

2187
02:03:21,701 --> 02:03:26,200
we are running out of spaces.
Need how many we need route nine more.

2188
02:03:26,260 --> 02:03:29,980
Nine more than we can do is
we're going to refresh this.

2189
02:03:29,981 --> 02:03:34,420
We're going to get nine more insight. We
are. We've got an eight more. We had one.

2190
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:39,040
We got one in the time. It took me
to say that sentence. We got to,

2191
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,230
I feel like I'm on the home shopping club.
What's,

2192
02:03:41,231 --> 02:03:45,550
go back to that in a little bit.
Um, actually we need a 109 more. Oh,

2193
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:48,730
that's nothing. We got that. I can't
remember. Why is it, I can't read that.

2194
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:50,770
Why is it blurry when
it's on that big screen,

2195
02:03:50,771 --> 02:03:52,820
but it's clear when
it's on your laptop now.

2196
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:56,220
Weird like numbers are separate pixel
thing. Is that what it is? Yeah.

2197
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:01,020
Two 38 94 yeah. Okay, so
we have 116 we need to,

2198
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:05,440
how many will you go down a look at
my last hot tweet in a hot one. Damn.

2199
02:04:05,460 --> 02:04:07,870
It just jumped crazy style.
Now we just need a,

2200
02:04:08,830 --> 02:04:12,890
it's kind of insulting that they
weren't following me before that. Yeah.

2201
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,610
You know what I mean? It's like, Hey,
fuck you guys. Hey. Rude. Like fuck.

2202
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:19,300
You know what? I'm going to, I'm going
to reserve judgment on this clown.

2203
02:04:19,301 --> 02:04:22,090
He hasn't convinced me yet.
Teach Bell podcast twice already.

2204
02:04:22,570 --> 02:04:26,400
Jumped up to 47 six again,
this is absolutely incredible.

2205
02:04:26,410 --> 02:04:30,100
That's Neil Brandon power.
Any a. L. B. R. E. N. N.

2206
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:34,030
I will say whatever. I'm on the road,
man. Every road, every road show.

2207
02:04:34,031 --> 02:04:38,060
I do have someone, at least one person
says they've heard on here. Oh, that's

2208
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,910
cause you're good. You did
a good job. You're thinking,
thank you. I'm happy. I know.

2209
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,670
Yeah,
we did it.

2210
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:50,940
Oh, exciting guys. But
keep going though. I just,

2211
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:52,770
because we hit. Don't,
don't do it all back off.

2212
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:56,410
Now let's take this momentum
and keep going. Oh, it's funny.

2213
02:04:56,411 --> 02:05:01,070
There's somebody said this douche
blocked me. Neil Brennan. Oh,

2214
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:04,950
I will block the shit out of
pal. I love block and paypal.
Well, you know what, man,

2215
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:06,300
you really should black people.

2216
02:05:06,301 --> 02:05:09,570
You shouldn't argue with them because
I've seen people like save rude, rude,

2217
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:12,100
rude shit to people and then
someone responds. But yeah,

2218
02:05:12,101 --> 02:05:16,350
I got you to respond to I when I've seen
that, I seen that many times. Some kid

2219
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,460
made today. I had the,
I had to tweet the kid,

2220
02:05:19,461 --> 02:05:21,980
the guy who yelled at the end of
the football game for Seattle.

2221
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:25,180
I don't know about that, but do you
know that Guy Robert? What's happened?

2222
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:29,520
Richard Sherman, I wrote
it, I wrote a, he got, he,

2223
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:32,250
the big thing today was that he
yelled at the end of the game, but he,

2224
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:34,520
during an interview, but he was
basically like, fuck you. You know,

2225
02:05:34,550 --> 02:05:38,390
he didn't say fuck you, but he just was
like very bump asset. Right. And uh,

2226
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:43,370
so I had a tweet about it today
and some kid wrote like, dude,

2227
02:05:43,371 --> 02:05:46,880
that was yesterday, so you're, you failed.

2228
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:51,290
And I just wrote Idm them. I said,
hey man, don't tell me about comedy.

2229
02:05:51,860 --> 02:05:55,880
Did you really? Yeah, I wrote, I've
gotten 500 retweets and five minutes,

2230
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,940
listen,
why would you want that guy

2231
02:06:00,270 --> 02:06:02,020
talking about it on the podcast?

2232
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:06,520
Because they think that they think you
don't smoke weed. That's what's going on.

2233
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:11,020
They think that they think
that they can insult people.

2234
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,090
This is what you should do when
someone says something like that.

2235
02:06:13,091 --> 02:06:17,200
Do you go aw sweetie. And then
block them. Yeah. I also do that.

2236
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:18,700
Most of the time I'll just block this kid,

2237
02:06:18,970 --> 02:06:23,290
this kid in particular ticket
where I had to go out of his,

2238
02:06:23,410 --> 02:06:26,170
I had to go out of pilot
for my comedy centers.

2239
02:06:26,170 --> 02:06:28,390
We'll show is I'm going to make sketches,

2240
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:31,450
I'm going to and I'm going
to be in him a ride them,

2241
02:06:31,451 --> 02:06:36,100
direct them and then I'm going to put
them on an iPad and go around to people on

2242
02:06:36,101 --> 02:06:39,700
the street and just say, Hey, do you
think this is funny? And if they don't,

2243
02:06:39,701 --> 02:06:43,280
I'll argue with them. And if
they do then it's, and if they,

2244
02:06:43,281 --> 02:06:46,030
and I'll stage arguments between
someone who doesn't think it's funny and

2245
02:06:46,031 --> 02:06:48,250
someone who does think it's funny,
I want to do it.

2246
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:51,650
What? Wait a minute. You're
show is to take a pilot,

2247
02:06:51,651 --> 02:06:54,320
put on an IPAD and I'll go take a sketch,
right.

2248
02:06:54,321 --> 02:06:57,200
Put it on an iPad and then
just go up to get a bus stop.

2249
02:06:57,260 --> 02:06:59,240
Say you think this is funny
and then argue with him.

2250
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,370
If he doesn't think it'll be fine.
I promise you,

2251
02:07:01,371 --> 02:07:03,680
it'll be funny cause I get in arguments
all the time about something not being

2252
02:07:03,681 --> 02:07:06,350
funny. It's, it'll be
fucking funny. I promise it.

2253
02:07:06,351 --> 02:07:09,230
In so many arguments about things not
being funny that you've decided to make a

2254
02:07:09,231 --> 02:07:12,760
show arguing that things are fun.
I did a thing on Twitter where I,

2255
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:15,630
right, I posted a joke where I said, hey,

2256
02:07:15,631 --> 02:07:18,750
I'm going to do this joke later tonight
and a club. Do you think this will work?

2257
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:22,380
Okay?
And a bunch of likes swimming up river.

2258
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:26,790
And I just think know what
makes you laugh is with comedy,

2259
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:31,800
people never say like, that's not
my taste. They go, that's not funny.

2260
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:35,890
It's this declaration. It's this
declaration. In fact, that makes me crazy.

2261
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,040
Right? But here's the
problem. Go to them the right.

2262
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:44,350
I know that's what's interesting. But
then they should say, in my opinion,

2263
02:07:44,351 --> 02:07:45,184
and they never do.

2264
02:07:45,630 --> 02:07:50,430
Oh, okay. So you just one with those
three words, your show gets eliminated.

2265
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:54,720
Yes. In my opinion, yes. Oh yeah. My
opinion. That's not funny. Neil brand.

2266
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:58,950
And then they go, I go, I literally
go, thank you for saying it that way.

2267
02:07:58,951 --> 02:08:02,340
You're correct. Oh, okay. So now
if they go, that's not funny. I go,

2268
02:08:02,341 --> 02:08:03,930
what do you think?
And here's the other thing I'll do.

2269
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,960
If they have a better way to make it
better, I will reshoot the sketch.

2270
02:08:06,990 --> 02:08:09,630
So would this is essentially is your,
uh,

2271
02:08:09,660 --> 02:08:12,450
it's a really sneaky way to
get people to learn manners

2272
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:17,600
in essence. Yeah. And it's also
taking people to task for, so,

2273
02:08:17,610 --> 02:08:20,520
so I said, I posted a joke on Twitter.
I go, do you think this will work?

2274
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:23,250
A bunch of comedy writers were like,
that's a good joke. That'll work.

2275
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:28,230
That'll work. Some kid wrote some,
no name k goes hundred percent bomb.

2276
02:08:28,860 --> 02:08:32,010
You know what I mean? Like just this
factual thing and it makes me crazy.

2277
02:08:32,011 --> 02:08:35,210
And then when I did the joke
later and it worked, he never,

2278
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:39,950
no, just setting yourself up to be trolled
so hard right now. Do you realize that?

2279
02:08:40,280 --> 02:08:45,230
But are you really sending a trap? This
is lot. It's taking trolls to task.

2280
02:08:45,260 --> 02:08:48,500
I'm doing lot. It's a live chat
room. I want to believe you,

2281
02:08:49,130 --> 02:08:52,280
but I'm not sure I do. I want to believe
that you're doing this on purpose.

2282
02:08:52,281 --> 02:08:55,670
But I kinda think that that's just what
you do and then you are enjoying your

2283
02:08:55,671 --> 02:09:00,110
embracing it. He goes, you just embracing
the fact that I'm argumentative. Yes.

2284
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:04,040
And even with trolls like
you like so what, so what
are you trying? What I never,

2285
02:09:04,041 --> 02:09:07,760
I don't, I don't address people online. I
don't go like, fuck you guy. I'm going to,

2286
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:11,810
I don't like [inaudible] you only go
personal DM if I'm gonna yeah, I will do.

2287
02:09:12,230 --> 02:09:14,690
Sometimes they'll DM and
go, hey, just so you know,

2288
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:18,150
here's why I'm locking you blocked.
Oh Wow. That's what I did today.

2289
02:09:18,170 --> 02:09:20,150
That why do you do that? Uh, I think,

2290
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:25,350
I think that they can't believe that
someone is listening to them and you just

2291
02:09:26,831 --> 02:09:29,980
go like, Hey, I'm here.
I saw what you said.

2292
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:30,611
That's sweet.

2293
02:09:30,611 --> 02:09:34,510
So you're going to hurt my guy who answers
the message in the bottle. But yes,

2294
02:09:34,511 --> 02:09:38,290
the message in the bottles cunty so
you send them a message back, fuck you,

2295
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:41,500
I'm going to break your bottle next time
I see it. Never fuck you. It's just,

2296
02:09:41,501 --> 02:09:44,240
hey man, that's not necessary.
He's the one that feeds the troll.

2297
02:09:44,241 --> 02:09:47,390
So now that they go to, you didn't
start doing that and they meet a chart.

2298
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:50,700
He's like one of those assholes that
feeds bears and then you go camping.

2299
02:09:50,720 --> 02:09:54,370
They rip your fucking tent apart because
fucking Neil Brennan was the last last

2300
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:57,370
week giving them cookies. Exactly. You're
fucking it up for everybody else buddy.

2301
02:09:58,510 --> 02:10:01,170
You know, what do you want me to do? I
don't want you to do anything other than

2302
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:05,920
email running. Don't worry about the
24 seven. I'm just analyzing you.

2303
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:08,350
I just put you into a category though.
One for what is it?

2304
02:10:08,380 --> 02:10:12,490
Argumentative and self defeating.
Troll feeder. I dude, I really don't.

2305
02:10:12,491 --> 02:10:16,960
I never respond to trolls. Everyone.
I love blocking people. Okay.

2306
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:21,190
Cause I, cause I believe in justice
will. Since you enjoy going on Twitter,

2307
02:10:21,191 --> 02:10:25,180
let's ask Twitter. Do you think
Neil Brennan is a troll feeder?

2308
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:31,760
Here we go. Let's see. Ah, this is a
term, you know, we just invented it.

2309
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,890
I'm going to say is feeder. What does
that mean? I instigate them. Yes.

2310
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:37,753
Okay,

2311
02:10:38,280 --> 02:10:38,690
okay.

2312
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:42,620
Please respond. I don't, but go ahead.
You look at my timeline. I don't, I don't,

2313
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:45,550
I don't.
Thanks in advance guys.

2314
02:10:45,570 --> 02:10:49,200
I'm my records and I
mean all that in advance.

2315
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,720
This is from the heart, sweetie. Let's
see. Let's see what the responses.

2316
02:10:53,810 --> 02:10:58,640
I would say 100% are they gonna say
yes, he's on. These are your people.

2317
02:10:58,641 --> 02:11:01,520
Your fucking goading them don't have
people in my friend. They're just people.

2318
02:11:01,521 --> 02:11:05,900
They're just regular people
who 238,000 Twitter followers.

2319
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:09,080
20 not 239 I don't feel like I own them.
Okay,

2320
02:11:09,290 --> 02:11:10,460
so I don't feel like there might be.

2321
02:11:10,530 --> 02:11:12,400
I know what they're going
to want to agree with you.

2322
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:15,200
The prone to want to read with you,
your people,

2323
02:11:15,260 --> 02:11:16,680
they're prone to want
to agree with you there.

2324
02:11:16,681 --> 02:11:20,430
There's small minded people
who would never disagree. Oh,

2325
02:11:20,431 --> 02:11:24,500
how I get them to my side. I
challenged them. Small minded.

2326
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:27,140
They don't want to challenge Joe.
They they want to go,

2327
02:11:27,141 --> 02:11:30,710
what do we get one now Joe?
Fuck this troll feeder.

2328
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:34,100
You are troll feeding right now.
You're trolling trolling you.

2329
02:11:34,101 --> 02:11:37,520
That's what's great about this.
This is a trick troll. Uh,

2330
02:11:37,521 --> 02:11:40,160
you would like to think that it's a trick
troll. That's like someone saying, Hey,

2331
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:43,520
I didn't want to win. The first
place meant to fall down. Who?

2332
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:47,990
I know what you're doing, dude, because
I'm not six. Okay. You're not tricking me.

2333
02:11:47,991 --> 02:11:51,500
Yeah, you're a troll feeder. It's
almost universal. Wow. This is crazy.

2334
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:55,040
I'm getting hammered, Bro.
Hammered. Like, what did anyone say?

2335
02:11:55,041 --> 02:12:00,041
I look like I've ain't yet
rude things about necessary.

2336
02:12:00,230 --> 02:12:04,310
That's not necessarily how, how's
the meth? Meth is a big one for me.

2337
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:08,200
People are rude, man.
Neil brands, my friend.

2338
02:12:08,850 --> 02:12:12,720
Anyone don't need to fucking,
I watched this special, eh?

2339
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:14,940
Yeah.

2340
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:17,650
It's never going to happen for this guy.
You should just be a writer.

2341
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:20,170
They're being mean man,
of course. But that's how,

2342
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:23,080
that's how they get your youtube
show. That's how I get them. Yeah.

2343
02:12:23,081 --> 02:12:25,320
That's how that now they've got my
attention. It's like a girlfriend.

2344
02:12:25,330 --> 02:12:28,780
I can't wait for this to end.
She can so we can go on the line.

2345
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:32,620
I can't wait to get home to my computer
and really the girlfriend argue just so

2346
02:12:32,621 --> 02:12:35,530
that you can make up. That's where it
is. What they're really being mean.

2347
02:12:35,531 --> 02:12:37,570
They really love you.
This is a trailer show the trailer.

2348
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,220
Then I moved to New York.

2349
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,540
Sorry.
I have a black dudes

2350
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:47,180
pounds.

2351
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:52,180
[inaudible] I don't know them.

2352
02:12:52,770 --> 02:12:53,603
They just are here.

2353
02:12:56,870 --> 02:12:58,670
Barely qualified.
You're so lights came of that

2354
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:05,510
[inaudible]

2355
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:10,920
yeah, so I got a lot of black
friends. I have like over uh,

2356
02:13:11,970 --> 02:13:16,600
over 20. Now. It's like almost 30. No,

2357
02:13:16,601 --> 02:13:19,180
I got a lot of black friends.
Here's the thing about my black friends.

2358
02:13:19,181 --> 02:13:22,850
My black friends can relax in a way that
my white friends can't wipe and we're

2359
02:13:22,851 --> 02:13:25,690
not very good at relaxing.
You know why I figured it out?

2360
02:13:25,691 --> 02:13:30,070
Cause we're always worried about the
rules and who's breaking the rules.

2361
02:13:30,071 --> 02:13:35,010
The other thing about being white got
admitted. We got tattletale and our DNA.

2362
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:41,750
We got snitch in our blood. White people
are in a nightclub of my black friends.

2363
02:13:41,751 --> 02:13:44,720
It'll be packed. Everybody's drinking,
dancing, laughing and having a great time.

2364
02:13:44,721 --> 02:13:48,440
And I'm trying to fit in like there
must be 350 people in here right now.

2365
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:51,860
I wonder what the fire marshal
would have to say about it.

2366
02:14:04,230 --> 02:14:09,230
White people love the rules so much that
we will go on police ride alongs for

2367
02:14:12,711 --> 02:14:17,540
fun. Vinnie idea white. That is
your, and try to explain that.

2368
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:20,400
Blind people like, yeah. I called the
precinct to say, hey, this is Neil.

2369
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:23,340
I'm white and I like
to go for a ride along.

2370
02:14:24,300 --> 02:14:27,010
They send over a squad car.
I get in the backseat,

2371
02:14:27,030 --> 02:14:29,970
which is fun for me because what other
opportunity would I had to do that?

2372
02:14:30,080 --> 02:14:30,913
No

2373
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:38,350
make you uncomfortable while
was not really, I like, I'm

2374
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:43,140
joy that you like watching yourself.
No, I just, I'd like those jokes. No,

2375
02:14:43,141 --> 02:14:44,850
they're very good Joe.
Yeah. It's funny. Yeah.

2376
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,440
It's totally true about
the ride along thing too.

2377
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:51,180
That is a weird aspect you're allowed
to do. I want to go, first of all,

2378
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:53,610
it's fucking dangerous as hell.
The idea that you're going to go,

2379
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,410
cops die every year.
Every day.

2380
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:59,370
You're going to go in the back of a cop
car while they investigate crimes and

2381
02:14:59,371 --> 02:15:03,590
that's going to be fun. Educational?
No, just just for enjoyment. Yeah.

2382
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:07,280
I love law and order. You have to pay to
do it. No, I think it's just like you're,

2383
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:09,090
if I think it's really got to know a cop,

2384
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:12,750
you should have to pay and it's probably
better than watching cops on TV if you

2385
02:15:12,751 --> 02:15:14,600
just get really stoned and going
to work right around there.

2386
02:15:14,640 --> 02:15:17,130
Cops should be able to give it
to you for free if they want to.

2387
02:15:17,131 --> 02:15:19,300
But ordinarily I think that people do it.
They should,

2388
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:22,560
the money should go to jazz up the
precinct by some new toilet paper or

2389
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:26,250
something. Yeah. Girly calendar
or something like that. They have,

2390
02:15:26,251 --> 02:15:29,340
can't have girly calendar. So at the
precinct they can think about that now.

2391
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:32,720
It's like a gas station thing. Can't
really have them at the precinct. Yeah.

2392
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:35,130
That you can cause a
female cop. Yeah. Yeah.

2393
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:37,790
A buddy of mine used to
do a thought experiment,

2394
02:15:37,791 --> 02:15:41,070
which is if you call nine one
one, it was, he was like, it was,

2395
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:45,980
it was a female inferiority thought,
thought, uh, experiment. But it's like,

2396
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:48,290
would you rather a female copper male cop?

2397
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:50,960
I don't think it's just
like unequivocally you,

2398
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:55,780
Malcolm. Um, I guess, is that true?

2399
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:59,290
I'm sure there would be a scenario
that you would want a female cop.

2400
02:15:59,530 --> 02:16:02,350
What would that be?
Domestic, domestic violence?

2401
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:05,980
No, not violence. The domestic
disturbance. Like A, if you're,

2402
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:08,340
I think if your girl's acting crazy,
you want a girl.

2403
02:16:08,730 --> 02:16:13,260
Although you could make a case that a
girl really acting crazy or the girl might

2404
02:16:13,261 --> 02:16:14,670
make them act more crazy.

2405
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:15,870
You wouldn't want to dude,

2406
02:16:15,871 --> 02:16:19,090
who understands what it's like to
have a girl acting crazy on you. Okay.

2407
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:22,590
I don't know. I don't cause I don't think
that a female cops going to be like,

2408
02:16:22,770 --> 02:16:24,980
then what did he do? You know
what I mean? Like I don't really,

2409
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:27,180
it might make the woman
relaxed more of a woman.

2410
02:16:27,770 --> 02:16:30,070
That's interesting.
I would think that would

2411
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,850
be the total opposite.
If I was a guy and um,

2412
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:37,210
my girl was going crazy and throwing
shit at me and the cop showed up,

2413
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:41,260
I would hope that a guy would show
up where I would go, dude, I look,

2414
02:16:41,350 --> 02:16:43,900
I shouldn't be with her. I
understand that. I fucked up.

2415
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:46,750
I picked a bad relationship. But you see
what the fuck's going on back then? Yeah.

2416
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:49,390
It just ain't me, man. I would
cause the grill. We're going to go.

2417
02:16:49,391 --> 02:16:50,590
What'd you say to make her do that?

2418
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:54,500
Well, yeah, but there's also a case that
women hate women more than men hate women

2419
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:55,940
sometimes,

2420
02:16:55,941 --> 02:16:59,600
but women hate men too that are assholes
and especially if you're a chick cop

2421
02:16:59,601 --> 02:17:01,250
and you have to deal
with so many shitheads,

2422
02:17:01,370 --> 02:17:03,110
that's the problem of being a cop is it?

2423
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:06,380
You have to do with so much craziness.

2424
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:08,740
It's a human garbage men,

2425
02:17:08,890 --> 02:17:11,830
and you literally have to clean up
human garbage all you have to just,

2426
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:13,570
you're the handyman for the earth.

2427
02:17:13,660 --> 02:17:15,610
Everyone's lying to you
because everybody went, thanks.

2428
02:17:15,611 --> 02:17:17,920
You're going to want to put them
in a cage and everywhere you go,

2429
02:17:17,921 --> 02:17:18,820
they know you're armed.

2430
02:17:18,850 --> 02:17:21,490
You know you're allowed to carry a
gun everywhere and no one else is.

2431
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,410
The whole thing is madness.

2432
02:17:23,620 --> 02:17:27,670
The idea of being a cop and just keeping
your shit together and hoping that they

2433
02:17:27,671 --> 02:17:31,450
don't get absolutely
crazy. You know, and Ptsd.

2434
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:34,060
We're talking about that with soldiers
soon. Think about that with cops.

2435
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:36,990
That's a huge problem.
Huge.

2436
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:39,230
Well that's like where they were beating.
They were,

2437
02:17:39,410 --> 02:17:40,540
they found out what they were,

2438
02:17:40,560 --> 02:17:43,850
they would beat guys when they
caught them during a car chase.

2439
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:47,930
Cause there's so hopped up on
adrenaline horse and they just fucking,

2440
02:17:47,931 --> 02:17:52,490
they have to do some with it and fucking
scared man. Scary fucking life. Yes.

2441
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:56,330
Driving a hundred miles an hour.
It's like that's scary. Yeah.

2442
02:17:56,690 --> 02:17:59,270
And then you have a gun and
you have to subdue a guy and

2443
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:03,480
it's an inefficient system. The whole cops
and robbers, good guy, bad guy system.

2444
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:05,580
It's inefficient.
It seems to be,

2445
02:18:05,640 --> 02:18:10,380
there's gotta be a better way to keep
track and keep a society on track to be,

2446
02:18:10,381 --> 02:18:12,540
keep people kind,
keep people law abiding.

2447
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:16,350
It doesn't seem like that the violence
versus violence version of me,

2448
02:18:16,470 --> 02:18:21,000
it feels necessary to protect
people and to stop bad guys,

2449
02:18:21,330 --> 02:18:23,910
but it's not the best system.
There's gotta be a better system.

2450
02:18:24,090 --> 02:18:27,600
I think we're going to look back on this
one day the same way we look back on

2451
02:18:27,601 --> 02:18:31,500
like stupid shit they did in the Middle
Ages or stupid shit they did back when

2452
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:34,710
during the renaissance needs to
cover piano legs cause they thought

2453
02:18:35,730 --> 02:18:39,690
brought back sided two people. Do you
have you talked about that before? Sure.

2454
02:18:39,691 --> 02:18:43,470
Yeah cause I want people to know that
that's like one of my favorite old timey

2455
02:18:43,471 --> 02:18:44,900
thing.
They used to do that.

2456
02:18:44,940 --> 02:18:48,500
So that's why there's skirts
on on a certain table.

2457
02:18:49,170 --> 02:18:51,540
Yeah. Certain table legs
they would put skirts on,

2458
02:18:51,541 --> 02:18:53,800
they'd put skirts on piano leg sometimes

2459
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:56,250
because they thought
people were going to fuck

2460
02:18:57,020 --> 02:18:58,070
piano.
Yeah.

2461
02:18:58,071 --> 02:19:01,910
And I wonder why they were so desperately
trying to stop people from fucking,

2462
02:19:01,911 --> 02:19:03,900
maybe they were running out of food
and they didn't want somebody baby.

2463
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:06,750
I think religion,
I think normally it's just pure.

2464
02:19:06,810 --> 02:19:08,390
It was probably like the
puritans or something.

2465
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:12,300
Yeah. And it's also, they're always
coming from this point of a suppression.

2466
02:19:12,301 --> 02:19:12,511
You know,

2467
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:15,810
there was coming from trying to stop
you from doing all the craziness that

2468
02:19:15,811 --> 02:19:16,291
you're doing,

2469
02:19:16,291 --> 02:19:20,610
but the idea that they were going to lock
things down so tightly that they were

2470
02:19:20,611 --> 02:19:23,760
going to put pants on table legs,

2471
02:19:23,761 --> 02:19:26,070
like those are people,
man.

2472
02:19:26,071 --> 02:19:29,570
People thought that it's totally
inefficient way of handling things.

2473
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:30,920
We know that now.

2474
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:33,760
I think one day we're going to look back
at the whole cops and bad guys thing.

2475
02:19:33,770 --> 02:19:34,603
We're going to say the same,

2476
02:19:34,730 --> 02:19:36,710
but what do you, what fucks, what do you,

2477
02:19:36,711 --> 02:19:40,960
what do you think that and a possible
evolution could be? It would have to be a,

2478
02:19:40,990 --> 02:19:44,150
a, an F. Which part of it? I
guess it's just arresting people.

2479
02:19:44,550 --> 02:19:46,140
Um,
well all the above.

2480
02:19:46,170 --> 02:19:50,940
I think we automatically assume that
people are going to commit crimes.

2481
02:19:50,941 --> 02:19:52,140
They're going to commit violent crimes,

2482
02:19:52,141 --> 02:19:53,760
are going to commit
violent actions and salt.

2483
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:56,820
We automatically just assume
that about people. But we do so,

2484
02:19:56,821 --> 02:20:00,480
so much less per capita than we
ever have throughout history now.

2485
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:03,090
And so if you follow that trend,
ultimately,

2486
02:20:03,091 --> 02:20:05,280
whether it's a hundred years from
now or a thousand years from now,

2487
02:20:05,470 --> 02:20:07,980
there's got come a point in time where we
don't have to worry about that anymore.

2488
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:10,770
How long will it take?
I don't know, but I see,

2489
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:15,860
if you look back on the way people lived
in the 12 hundreds the way people lived

2490
02:20:15,901 --> 02:20:20,340
at 2000 BC or what we suppose they lived,
but life was much more dangerous,

2491
02:20:20,341 --> 02:20:23,250
much more violent, much more chaotic.
You're much more likely to get murdered.

2492
02:20:23,940 --> 02:20:27,600
I think that if you follow that
logic at a certain point in time,

2493
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:29,150
especially when you fall,
you see that

2494
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:31,340
you think you're more likely
to get murdered back then,

2495
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:36,080
most definitely much my
average person's murdered

2496
02:20:36,580 --> 02:20:38,530
from every everything,
murder or assault.

2497
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:41,950
I think you're much safer today then
you probably have been at any time

2498
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:45,280
ministry. I actually think that
that's true, but I think that,

2499
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,820
I think that it has a lot. I don't
know if that's human evolution so much.

2500
02:20:48,821 --> 02:20:53,020
It's just better. A better long
crime, crime and punishment system.

2501
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:57,430
Ooh, I doubt that. Because the crime and
punishment system is completely corrupt.

2502
02:20:57,460 --> 02:20:59,150
And there's private prisons that,

2503
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:04,430
oh dude, fucking awful. But I think that
that's the reason. I mean it's, it's,

2504
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:09,480
it's as evil. That movie I
recommended the house I live in. Yes,

2505
02:21:09,930 --> 02:21:13,380
it's criminal enterprise. Watch
that movie, the House I live in,

2506
02:21:13,381 --> 02:21:14,280
it's fucking amazing

2507
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:20,060
profit off of putting people in jail
and you could therefore petition or um,

2508
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:21,830
uh,
you know,

2509
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:26,000
spend money and lobby to make sure that
laws are kept in place so that you can

2510
02:21:26,001 --> 02:21:28,190
ensure that more people
will be put in prisons.

2511
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:31,100
The idea that that's true is terrifying.

2512
02:21:31,101 --> 02:21:35,210
That there's someone out there that's
a vampire and they're sucking the blood

2513
02:21:35,211 --> 02:21:38,510
out of people by putting them in cages.
And when you put them in cages,

2514
02:21:38,511 --> 02:21:39,560
you profit off that.

2515
02:21:39,561 --> 02:21:43,010
So what you want to do is make it so
it's written down on paper somewhere that

2516
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:47,810
you're allowed to put people in cages.
Even if there's this huge tidal wave of,

2517
02:21:47,811 --> 02:21:50,810
of, of, of attention that is supporting,

2518
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:54,830
making things legal that are not
hurting anyone like marijuana.

2519
02:21:54,831 --> 02:21:59,540
There's still people lobbying
these vampires lobbying
to make sure that it stays

2520
02:21:59,541 --> 02:22:03,970
illegal and that that
punishment is enforced on the
people that commit, you know,

2521
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:06,920
these quote unquote crimes,
these crimes that hurt. No one,

2522
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:08,280
I disagree with you that I,

2523
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:12,040
I don't think people are any more moral
than they were a thousand years ago.

2524
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:13,260
I don't know.

2525
02:22:13,260 --> 02:22:15,930
Sin didn't say that more and
more, all I say it's safer. Um,

2526
02:22:15,970 --> 02:22:18,940
I think that they're more educated
and if you're more educated,

2527
02:22:18,941 --> 02:22:20,410
you have more access to information,

2528
02:22:20,411 --> 02:22:24,010
you're more likely because of the
fact that you have more information.

2529
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:27,540
You're more likely to make an intelligent
choice than you ever have in the past.

2530
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:30,690
I don't think it means that people are
always going to make intelligent choices,

2531
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:34,230
but I think you're more likely to make
an intelligent choice then back when they

2532
02:22:34,231 --> 02:22:36,990
were drowning people, cause they all
thought they were witches. You know,

2533
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:39,120
now people don't have that as an excuse.

2534
02:22:39,121 --> 02:22:42,750
They know there aren't any fucking witches
and so they're less likely to drown

2535
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:45,410
someone in a fit of hysteria because you
worried that some crazy bitch is gonna

2536
02:22:45,430 --> 02:22:48,750
put a hex on your kids and they
get cancer. I think that's fact.

2537
02:22:48,810 --> 02:22:51,060
And if you look at that trend,

2538
02:22:51,300 --> 02:22:55,140
that's an information trend that's a
trend of we have more access to the truth.

2539
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:59,220
We have more access to just raw data
and information and we also have more

2540
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:03,000
information that shows all the corruption,

2541
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:06,060
all the problems with
various power systems.

2542
02:23:06,120 --> 02:23:09,810
You know about that stat
that the higher the,

2543
02:23:10,590 --> 02:23:14,730
the fewer basically the
more education women get,

2544
02:23:14,731 --> 02:23:18,080
the fewer babies there are in the country.
It's one of my favorite things.

2545
02:23:18,130 --> 02:23:22,960
Like the best, it's the best. The best
contraception contraceptive is sensation.

2546
02:23:23,150 --> 02:23:23,983
Yeah.

2547
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:27,370
Well that's also in cities
per capita, they, uh,

2548
02:23:27,371 --> 02:23:31,870
the people in cities per capita tend
to breed less as they get more and more

2549
02:23:31,871 --> 02:23:33,130
successful.
Well,

2550
02:23:33,131 --> 02:23:36,760
they were saying that that's one of the
things that people who are against the

2551
02:23:36,761 --> 02:23:39,670
idea that human population
is going to explode.

2552
02:23:39,970 --> 02:23:44,590
One of their main points of reference
and argument is that human population

2553
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:49,740
declines when conditions improve and
that when you're dealing with conditions

2554
02:23:49,871 --> 02:23:52,750
where life is fleeting, people
are poor, everyone's dying.

2555
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:54,430
People have a tremendous
amount of children.

2556
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:58,360
Then when these places
industrialized and start to thrive,

2557
02:23:58,390 --> 02:24:02,350
then there becomes less and less children
and that in fact we might reach a

2558
02:24:02,351 --> 02:24:05,890
trend, a tipping point someday where
the population starts to decline.

2559
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:11,210
I was talking to a buddy of mine about
the reason why poor people have bad diets

2560
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:17,120
and a lot of high diabetes shit like that
and obesity is cause their life sucks

2561
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:21,900
and they don't want their food to suck
their food is some of the only pleasure

2562
02:24:21,901 --> 02:24:26,340
that yet. So they need
sweet shit. They fried shit.

2563
02:24:26,341 --> 02:24:31,341
They eat like fucking unhealthy shit
cause that's why does that have to suck to

2564
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:37,010
that could be a reason. You
know the reason could be bad
education. It could be a,

2565
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:41,790
a lack of understanding of the direct
effect that putting poor nutrition in your

2566
02:24:41,791 --> 02:24:46,410
body has on you also could be the fact
that poor nutrition is much cheaper than

2567
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:51,000
housing and the access to
it so much easier. You know,

2568
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:53,220
fast food's everywhere.
It's all over the place.

2569
02:24:53,221 --> 02:24:56,340
You can't just get a salad and you can't
just drive down the street and get her

2570
02:24:56,341 --> 02:24:59,680
super healthy salad, desert
dessert, maybe call it. Yeah.

2571
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:03,480
Thinking about all the different places,
whether it's a Taco bell or fucking,

2572
02:25:03,510 --> 02:25:07,830
you know, Mcdonald's or Burger
King or Wendy's, how many
of those you see Bam, Bam,

2573
02:25:07,831 --> 02:25:09,960
Bam, Bam, Bam when you're
driving down the normal streets.

2574
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:13,950
But how many like salad places, how
many places that sell, you know,

2575
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:18,160
spinach smoothies? I mean, how
many of those, the, the access is,

2576
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:20,970
is for, especially for poor
people, it's not that good.

2577
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:23,380
No,
it's atrocious as a of fact.

2578
02:25:23,590 --> 02:25:27,040
And the other thing is vetted vegetables
and fruit are pretty expensive.

2579
02:25:27,041 --> 02:25:28,600
Like that's the,
exactly what you were saying.

2580
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:33,590
Yeah. You know, talked to a poor person
about shopping at whole foods. What? Yeah,

2581
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:38,460
no, I can't afford that shit. Yeah, yeah.
It's a mess. It's a mess. So it's a,

2582
02:25:38,461 --> 02:25:42,440
it's also a kind of a weird trick, you
know, if you think about it that way,

2583
02:25:42,441 --> 02:25:45,530
I mean, what's the best way to keep people
poor, making poor when they're young.

2584
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,460
You know, Megan port, keeping involved
with a bunch of other poor people,

2585
02:25:49,461 --> 02:25:50,780
wrap them up with poor people,

2586
02:25:50,781 --> 02:25:53,660
have poor people around them all the time
and then do nothing to help change it

2587
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:55,340
and you're going to get
a lot of poor people.

2588
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:56,990
That's a good way to keep poor people.

2589
02:25:57,080 --> 02:25:58,700
She wanted to keep a
supply of poor people.

2590
02:25:58,701 --> 02:26:02,930
Now I'm not insinuating that
there's some sort of a, uh, a, uh,

2591
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:07,880
some sort of a conspiracy to
make sure that people are poor.

2592
02:26:07,881 --> 02:26:08,660
I don't believe that.

2593
02:26:08,660 --> 02:26:12,170
But what I do believe that if
anybody really wanted to change it,

2594
02:26:12,171 --> 02:26:14,510
they would do something different
than what we're already doing.

2595
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:14,951
Well,
you know,

2596
02:26:14,951 --> 02:26:19,951
that thing about the upward mobility is
America has failed the American dream.

2597
02:26:21,221 --> 02:26:26,020
Basically America's 16th in the world,
in the American dream.

2598
02:26:26,390 --> 02:26:31,220
That meaning like jump basically
class jumping, like going from La,

2599
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:32,920
uh,
you know,

2600
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:37,180
lower middle class to middle class or
middle class to upper middle class or like

2601
02:26:37,181 --> 02:26:39,930
it's, it's and it's getting
lowered. Used to be way higher. We,

2602
02:26:40,090 --> 02:26:41,170
I think we used to be number one.

2603
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:44,620
So is that it's far like the percentage
of people that do it? Is that what it is?

2604
02:26:44,621 --> 02:26:45,454
Yeah.

2605
02:26:45,490 --> 02:26:48,670
Per capita or whatever? Well that's
fucked. What's number one now?

2606
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:53,770
I think like Denmark, maybe Denmark,
Denmark or Germany, Denmark,

2607
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:58,090
Germany or Japan. I feel like I
could be wrong but, but uh, but yeah,

2608
02:26:58,091 --> 02:26:59,470
it's like if you want the American,

2609
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:04,420
I had a buddy that had a girlfriend from
Denmark and um, the uh, fell in love,

2610
02:27:04,421 --> 02:27:06,730
all that good stuff. And uh, he, uh,

2611
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:11,760
went back with her to Denmark and he
had so many problems like visa problems,

2612
02:27:11,800 --> 02:27:15,580
issues. Beth centration very,
very difficult for him to,

2613
02:27:15,581 --> 02:27:18,460
I don't know if he married her,
I'm not sure. But I remember him,

2614
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:22,660
I ran into him like after the process,
like was sort of in the middle of it,

2615
02:27:22,810 --> 02:27:25,000
embroiled in it. He was like, it was
really hard. It's really hard to get,

2616
02:27:25,001 --> 02:27:27,610
or they don't want people just coming
over there because they have an

2617
02:27:27,611 --> 02:27:29,620
unbelievably smooth system.
Like yeah,

2618
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:33,440
you can't be a criminal and you can't
kind of a record. You can't be a bad guy.

2619
02:27:33,441 --> 02:27:37,800
You can't like, they want, you know, and
then they're also, they their, their uh,

2620
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:40,660
their system is so nice
and so well set up.

2621
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:43,490
Yeah. They're not on. So bring
us your tired, your poor.

2622
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:48,560
They don't want to meet Mike.
Bring us your clean, efficient.

2623
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:50,633
Yeah.

2624
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:55,300
When you see like countries like Iceland
that I've like really fucking done a

2625
02:27:55,301 --> 02:27:57,580
good job of organizing their country.

2626
02:27:57,700 --> 02:28:00,970
They dealt with a financial crisis and
then they fucking went after the bankers.

2627
02:28:00,971 --> 02:28:04,210
Yeah. That's the best suit. Them,
lock them all up, kicked them all out.

2628
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:07,090
And you look at that like as a,
you know, sort of a microcosm.

2629
02:28:07,091 --> 02:28:09,310
It's a small country in
comparison to the United States.

2630
02:28:09,311 --> 02:28:11,980
Small in comparison to California,
you know,

2631
02:28:11,981 --> 02:28:15,250
but what they did is not
just admirable but possible.

2632
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:20,170
Like someone from somewhere on
earth in 2004 being a human being.

2633
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:22,100
Yeah.
Who speaks a language

2634
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,400
that the people around him on in her
understand and they figured it out.

2635
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:29,790
They decided and Vince one
another. Yeah. That was the best.

2636
02:28:29,791 --> 02:28:32,550
I mean that's enough. One of the things
you've just got to get lucky early.

2637
02:28:33,120 --> 02:28:33,820
You got to get lucky.

2638
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:37,530
The 18 hundreds that you get a good
fucking dude and then that just indoors,

2639
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:41,920
but they're subject to the same sort of
deal that we are over here really. Right.

2640
02:28:41,921 --> 02:28:44,440
They're subject to
corruption and bribery and,

2641
02:28:44,490 --> 02:28:47,980
and people being unethical somehow or
another. They figured it out though.

2642
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:50,540
But I think, I feel like it's
probably lower over there.

2643
02:28:50,541 --> 02:28:52,490
I think America does some shit like that.

2644
02:28:52,491 --> 02:28:57,140
Like I think America fucking
breeds it's, it's, yeah.

2645
02:28:57,141 --> 02:28:58,550
I mean like we've talked about it before.

2646
02:28:58,551 --> 02:29:03,551
It's like there's something
about America's the last
on conquered land on the

2647
02:29:05,121 --> 02:29:06,020
earth.
This was it.

2648
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:11,050
So the people here and capitalism is a
real fucking like elbow fro and shit.

2649
02:29:13,410 --> 02:29:16,160
Yeah. A lot of elbow throwing
that gets your space. Yeah.

2650
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:19,910
And at this point it's like,
I don't know how you feel about money,

2651
02:29:19,911 --> 02:29:22,430
but I feel like at a certain
point it just becomes,

2652
02:29:22,480 --> 02:29:24,230
if you have a certain amount of money,

2653
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:28,730
it just becomes about your collecting
carnival tickets. It's like, motherfucker,

2654
02:29:28,731 --> 02:29:32,450
you don't need any more of these tickets,
but people want to win.

2655
02:29:32,451 --> 02:29:34,100
It's the only way to keep score.

2656
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:35,271
Well,
yeah.

2657
02:29:35,271 --> 02:29:39,410
Well I was talking about this recently
that if you see a guy who's worth like a

2658
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:41,710
hundred billion dollars,
but he's fucking completely miserable.

2659
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:44,180
He's on antidepressants and
his life's fallen apart.

2660
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:47,780
His wife left him and he's fucking
suicidal. You still got a Tan,

2661
02:29:47,781 --> 02:29:48,740
but it's still worth $100

2662
02:29:48,920 --> 02:29:52,780
I, yeah, you got it. That's what
I always say. It's like, dude,

2663
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:56,310
if that was me,
even though that was him and Pete,

2664
02:29:56,340 --> 02:30:00,540
and they've done studies
that over a certain amount
of money, happiness doesn't,

2665
02:30:00,541 --> 02:30:04,080
you don't get happy over like,
I think it's like 78 grand a year,

2666
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:05,100
but he'll look at you,

2667
02:30:05,160 --> 02:30:08,190
Neil Brennan being a successful
comedian and having a good life,

2668
02:30:08,191 --> 02:30:11,610
being a happy guy, having a bunch of good
friends and like this fucking failure.

2669
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:15,320
Oh yeah. Once you got in the
bank killing herself, zeroes.

2670
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:20,430
Fuck. Yeah. Just on the way that
the their deathbed fuck. Yeah.

2671
02:30:20,580 --> 02:30:23,220
I'm about to go step into
the biggest shot ever made.

2672
02:30:23,221 --> 02:30:26,730
I own it flying to my island later today.
I own that.

2673
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:29,440
Sorry about this.
It goes to that private jet thing.

2674
02:30:29,441 --> 02:30:32,740
I probably been on four or five private
jets and it's always with pivot or

2675
02:30:32,741 --> 02:30:37,270
Chappelle or whatever. But uh, every
time I've been in a private jet,

2676
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:39,160
when you land,

2677
02:30:39,730 --> 02:30:44,730
the person who ordered the jet always
points to another bigger jet and goes,

2678
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,410
that was the jet I want it to get.
It happens without fit.

2679
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:52,840
It's one of these weird human
quirks where it's like, no,

2680
02:30:53,050 --> 02:30:57,730
no thing is enough. You, you're
on a private plane and you,

2681
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:59,380
you're insecure about it.

2682
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:03,070
There was a private plane that you
had your eye on that was better.

2683
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:03,391
Well,

2684
02:31:03,391 --> 02:31:07,950
that seems to be like a symptom of the
type of person who makes so much money.

2685
02:31:07,951 --> 02:31:11,850
They can afford a private. Exactly.
And that's crazy. Yeah. Crixus

2686
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:14,810
constantly. It's never fucking, it's
just fucking them. We've got to get more,

2687
02:31:14,990 --> 02:31:16,970
we're going to get more proud of jets.
That coke thing.

2688
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,220
How much is a private jet caused?
It depends where you're going

2689
02:31:20,530 --> 02:31:21,660
now.
Maybe mean to own a private

2690
02:31:21,860 --> 02:31:24,890
oh to own, I don't know. I
think 5 million or something.

2691
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:28,760
No, I think it's more than
that. Maybe nine in how?

2692
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:31,130
I think it's like 50 how
much does it private check?

2693
02:31:31,220 --> 02:31:34,420
It depends what you're getting. If you
get like a g three I don't fucking know.

2694
02:31:34,440 --> 02:31:39,430
I'm acting like I know. Well we're,
we're both so far. Gulf stream.

2695
02:31:39,790 --> 02:31:43,510
Okay. Check costs. Shh. Keep
it down. I'm trying to stay

2696
02:31:45,970 --> 02:31:49,990
light jets. 3 million to 8 million
can take five to eight passengers,

2697
02:31:50,230 --> 02:31:51,760
mid size executive jets.

2698
02:31:51,761 --> 02:31:55,720
9 million to 16 million can
take up to nine passengers.

2699
02:31:55,890 --> 02:31:58,780
Well this guy's got it nailed.
Large executive jets,

2700
02:31:58,930 --> 02:32:03,930
17 million can carry 12
passengers more than 4,000 miles.

2701
02:32:05,350 --> 02:32:07,810
Wow. Consider the hidden costs
along with the price tag.

2702
02:32:07,811 --> 02:32:12,700
That ranges from 6 million to 50
million for a new private jet and Nessus

2703
02:32:12,730 --> 02:32:14,590
necessities such as insurance,
fuel,

2704
02:32:14,620 --> 02:32:18,890
catering and pilots who are in short
supply aircraft management companies will

2705
02:32:18,891 --> 02:32:21,850
take care of these needs for about a
hundred thousand dollars to $200,000 per

2706
02:32:21,851 --> 02:32:24,880
year depending on the size and
usage of that yet. Thank you.

2707
02:32:24,881 --> 02:32:29,380
Jay K from um,
answers.yahoo.com

2708
02:32:31,390 --> 02:32:35,790
yeah, that's a very well
thought out response. Yeah.
So a lot of money. The color,

2709
02:32:35,870 --> 02:32:38,230
it's baller category.
If you've got your own three,

2710
02:32:38,231 --> 02:32:41,560
it's at least 3 million according to that.
There's a lot of fucking money.

2711
02:32:41,561 --> 02:32:45,280
So 3 million that you have
no use for. Well, you know,

2712
02:32:45,281 --> 02:32:48,400
if you're some fucking Weirdo Frank
Sinatra character and you don't like being

2713
02:32:48,401 --> 02:32:52,000
around people, yeah, you can get in that
plane. And just all of a sudden, Bam,

2714
02:32:52,001 --> 02:32:54,700
you land in Atlantic City,
get off and get on stage.

2715
02:32:55,970 --> 02:33:00,190
When you see Seinfeld do that. Yeah. It
doesn't rise in flies out that night.

2716
02:33:00,470 --> 02:33:03,010
He's got so much cash.
Stop and thinking about that.

2717
02:33:03,480 --> 02:33:05,520
Well that's the thing about
Saiful that people don't realize.

2718
02:33:05,521 --> 02:33:06,600
You know how they go,
man,

2719
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:09,660
Larry David made $500 million
when they sold it to syndication.

2720
02:33:10,020 --> 02:33:12,900
They've sold it two more times since then.

2721
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:17,790
It just wasn't in the paper. How do
you keep selling that? Because the,

2722
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:22,710
because there, because the rights
are only for six years. Yeah.

2723
02:33:22,711 --> 02:33:26,850
It's a crazy amount of money.
He's an interesting cat.
And also it doesn't matter.

2724
02:33:26,940 --> 02:33:31,080
And it, it's, it's, it's carnival
tickets. It's like you can only buy,

2725
02:33:31,081 --> 02:33:34,260
you can only fly private so much.
You can only buy so many cars.

2726
02:33:34,350 --> 02:33:38,880
Yeah. But in Jay's, um, in
Jerry's rather a case he's got,

2727
02:33:38,930 --> 02:33:42,480
I was thinking of Lenovo for some reason
when I said 70 cars automatically think

2728
02:33:42,481 --> 02:33:43,980
of Lennon.
But that's the same thing.

2729
02:33:43,981 --> 02:33:48,110
It's like they really love cars
like snow and Jerry Seinfeld Bolts,

2730
02:33:48,150 --> 02:33:52,390
fucking love cars. You ever see comedians
in cars getting coffee that way?

2731
02:33:52,480 --> 02:33:56,820
It was on last week, the way
that guy talks about cars,
both of them, but the way,

2732
02:33:56,821 --> 02:33:59,700
especially the way Seinfeld talks about
cars when he's describing each car that

2733
02:33:59,701 --> 02:34:04,050
he's driving, that guy loves.
Absolutely. So for him,

2734
02:34:04,110 --> 02:34:05,190
he had to make that much,

2735
02:34:05,191 --> 02:34:07,710
but it's good to make that kind of
money because you can't have a hundred

2736
02:34:07,711 --> 02:34:09,840
fucking Porsche's unless
you got some [inaudible].

2737
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:12,820
There's that thing where
if you win the lottery,

2738
02:34:12,850 --> 02:34:17,850
there's a median happiness level that you
just have built in that you achieve or

2739
02:34:18,311 --> 02:34:22,270
do or get can,
can change more than 15 or 20%

2740
02:34:22,310 --> 02:34:26,540
sure. And not only that, you can actually
be happy, but it a financial deficit.

2741
02:34:26,541 --> 02:34:30,650
But you, if you're at a happiness deficit,
but yet you're financially in the,

2742
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:34,580
in the red, you still are in the black
rather, you're still not feeling good.

2743
02:34:34,610 --> 02:34:37,370
Exactly. You know, it's the talk of the
red. Which one? The black, the red is bad.

2744
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:40,610
Yeah, you're still, it's not good. Yeah.

2745
02:34:40,670 --> 02:34:43,430
But almost everyone would
choose that over the former.

2746
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:46,520
Well, that's what I say. I always
say people go, you know the we,

2747
02:34:46,550 --> 02:34:50,620
we always say like money won't, won't,
can't buy you happiness and everyone goes,

2748
02:34:50,800 --> 02:34:53,980
I'll take my chances.
I'll just see about that.

2749
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:57,490
I'm going to do it differently.
My friend.

2750
02:34:57,550 --> 02:35:00,220
Well it's cause everybody thinks about
the things that are bothering them,

2751
02:35:00,310 --> 02:35:03,880
bothering them in life and for
a lot of people it's financial.

2752
02:35:04,230 --> 02:35:06,160
A lot of people it's financial stress.

2753
02:35:06,310 --> 02:35:10,270
Like when your when your day to day or
week to week like I remember very clearly

2754
02:35:10,300 --> 02:35:15,190
when I first got my first,
when I actually started making money,

2755
02:35:15,220 --> 02:35:18,190
when I was living in New York and I got
a development deal and all of a sudden

2756
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:21,910
it was, it wasn't a lot of money
but it was a chunk that boom,

2757
02:35:21,970 --> 02:35:24,490
I was given and then I don't have
to worry about money anymore.

2758
02:35:24,550 --> 02:35:27,970
Like all of a sudden I can
pay my bills now I have,

2759
02:35:28,030 --> 02:35:29,980
I have some money in the bank,
I can go to dinner.

2760
02:35:31,130 --> 02:35:35,980
There's this huge way the copper shoulders
a little bit less or it was literally

2761
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:39,370
a week before that. Everything was
a struggle. It's like, what do I,

2762
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:43,440
how many quarters do I have?
I have a $5 and then six quarters,

2763
02:35:43,450 --> 02:35:46,390
I got a $6 and then you may like,
I would literally think that way,

2764
02:35:46,410 --> 02:35:50,020
but everything was a struggle. How am
I going to come up with $38 for this?

2765
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:52,600
This is 100 bucks at the end of the month.
How am I gonna Afford that?

2766
02:35:52,601 --> 02:35:56,230
And it was always in my head
spinning around and distracting me.

2767
02:35:56,410 --> 02:35:58,990
And when would that was
removed? I was like, Ooh,

2768
02:35:59,010 --> 02:36:01,360
well here's one of the really
good things about money.

2769
02:36:01,361 --> 02:36:03,400
It's not necessarily that
money buys you happiness,

2770
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:07,990
but the alleviation of at least one piece
of stress that most of us have to go

2771
02:36:07,991 --> 02:36:10,900
through on a daily basis.
Financial stress, that's,

2772
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:12,520
there's something to be said for that.

2773
02:36:12,620 --> 02:36:13,670
There is very much,

2774
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:18,380
but what I've noticed is
other things fill the space.

2775
02:36:19,250 --> 02:36:22,460
Meaning you just, you have a list
of things you're worried about.

2776
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:26,660
Money goes off the top and then
everybody else moves up because you're,

2777
02:36:27,020 --> 02:36:31,550
you're kind of, there's a certain amount
of stress your body just is built for.

2778
02:36:31,670 --> 02:36:34,850
Do you know what I mean? Do you really
think that? I do. I mean, I find I've,

2779
02:36:34,910 --> 02:36:37,340
it's certainly a thing that like,
I don't,

2780
02:36:37,341 --> 02:36:40,220
because people that are rich aren't
naturally hat. You know what I mean?

2781
02:36:40,221 --> 02:36:43,000
It doesn't automatically make you happy,
which I feel like proves that

2782
02:36:43,080 --> 02:36:45,150
it definitely doesn't
automatically make you happy,

2783
02:36:45,180 --> 02:36:47,450
but it doesn't mean that people
who are rich can't be happy.

2784
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:49,370
Oh, I don't think that, I
don't think that at all.

2785
02:36:49,371 --> 02:36:52,850
I just think if you're happy and poor,

2786
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:56,210
you're going to be happy and rich
and if you're unhappy and poor,

2787
02:36:56,420 --> 02:36:57,860
you're probably going
to be unhappy and ready.

2788
02:36:58,110 --> 02:37:00,270
I don't know. Even know if that's
true. That's a generalization.

2789
02:37:00,271 --> 02:37:02,610
It's a lot of people happy when they
were in the jars. Asian business,

2790
02:37:02,700 --> 02:37:06,570
they start getting rich and then they have
mo money, Mo problems about that, huh?

2791
02:37:06,600 --> 02:37:09,290
Yeah. That's well, that's
Puffy I think. Yeah.

2792
02:37:09,720 --> 02:37:13,800
I think that people are doing it wrong.
That's what I think. I think, uh,

2793
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:15,860
there's a lot of,
they're doing it wrong out there

2794
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:20,290
and there's a lot of people that are
living lives based almost entirely on

2795
02:37:20,300 --> 02:37:23,330
momentum. They just doing things the way
they've always done and they're defining

2796
02:37:23,331 --> 02:37:25,040
themselves by their past mistakes.

2797
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:28,120
Yeah. Anna react, they're
reacting to their past mistakes

2798
02:37:28,210 --> 02:37:30,280
and they,
they fall into the same traps,

2799
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:33,370
whether it's a gambling trap
or relationship trap. I mean,

2800
02:37:33,371 --> 02:37:35,490
how many people do I
know people that they,

2801
02:37:35,530 --> 02:37:40,530
they're serial monogamists where
they'll have one crazy super involved

2802
02:37:40,751 --> 02:37:43,960
relationship for like six months and
then another crazy super and they go one,

2803
02:37:43,961 --> 02:37:44,690
two

2804
02:37:44,690 --> 02:37:47,850
stop and go. Like, this is
defeating. This is sort of nuts.

2805
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,970
Yeah. Well it's also, they like
immediately take someone in the,

2806
02:37:50,971 --> 02:37:52,950
immediately fall deeply in love,

2807
02:37:52,951 --> 02:37:56,040
the immediately spend every
minute together and then boom,

2808
02:37:56,041 --> 02:37:59,340
you see him next month and where,
where's, where's Wendy? Oh, Wendy's gone.

2809
02:37:59,341 --> 02:38:02,250
Who's this? This is Cindy. Oh,
okay. And they know like, okay,

2810
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:04,960
Cindy's through this life
as subtle as shit, man.

2811
02:38:04,961 --> 02:38:07,360
You know what I'm talking about those
people, that's like a real common thing.

2812
02:38:07,361 --> 02:38:10,250
Right? What was the, what was
the last thing he said? It
needs the new Wendy. Yeah.

2813
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:13,660
Oh absolutely.
But what I was saying is life subtle.

2814
02:38:14,650 --> 02:38:17,080
Well, it's also, we, we
seek comfort in patterns.

2815
02:38:17,470 --> 02:38:21,640
One of the things that people hate more
than anything is the fear of the unknown.

2816
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:23,060
Yeah. You know, and uh,

2817
02:38:23,110 --> 02:38:26,120
that's one of the things that people are
severely lacking and they were lacking

2818
02:38:26,121 --> 02:38:28,260
in it. Adventure. You know,
there's something about,

2819
02:38:28,261 --> 02:38:29,800
and being in the middle
of doing something,

2820
02:38:29,801 --> 02:38:33,250
we have no idea what the fuck is going to
happen. And we were like, wow, this is,

2821
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:37,990
this is kind of wild. This is, this is a
crazy experience. And that's, that's like,

2822
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:41,290
that's important for life
to be involved in things.

2823
02:38:41,291 --> 02:38:44,320
You don't know how they're going to
turn out. Not necessarily dangerous,

2824
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:48,660
but something different than
driving to the same fucking Yep.

2825
02:38:48,730 --> 02:38:53,320
You know, it hearkens, makes me laugh
is when you'll be on like a busy street,

2826
02:38:53,321 --> 02:38:57,460
Ventura or Fairfax or whatever,
and you know,

2827
02:38:57,550 --> 02:39:02,550
everyone knows there's a side street and
almost no one takes it because they're

2828
02:39:02,861 --> 02:39:06,580
just afraid something fucked up is going
to happen on the side street. It's like,

2829
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:10,540
just go on the site. It's,
it's day, it's light out.

2830
02:39:10,870 --> 02:39:13,870
Nothing's going to happen.
But people are so used to like,

2831
02:39:13,871 --> 02:39:16,960
let me just stay on Ventura.
I know Ventura,

2832
02:39:17,440 --> 02:39:20,470
everything's going to be fun because
people are just naturally sort of fearful

2833
02:39:20,471 --> 02:39:24,470
and they seek comfort
in, in, in the in, right

2834
02:39:24,510 --> 02:39:28,350
Titian yeah.
They want to eliminate the possibilities.

2835
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:32,370
That's of like a big thing with people.
Like what do people plan for?

2836
02:39:32,371 --> 02:39:36,720
They plan for retirement when they get
can stop all this and enjoy their golden

2837
02:39:36,721 --> 02:39:37,051
years.

2838
02:39:37,051 --> 02:39:41,040
So the idea is that you're
going to alleviate all of
your stress and all of the

2839
02:39:41,041 --> 02:39:45,970
unknown, but that's not going to happen.
You're not really alleviating that. The,

2840
02:39:46,090 --> 02:39:46,680
the,
the,

2841
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:50,670
the stress of the unknown is just a part
of the wonder and the mystery of life.

2842
02:39:50,671 --> 02:39:53,850
You're supposed to embrace that.
It's supposed to embrace that adventure.

2843
02:39:53,851 --> 02:39:58,080
And if you do, you find yourself living
in exciting and fascinating life.

2844
02:39:58,350 --> 02:40:00,750
And if you don't,
you live the life of a fearful man.

2845
02:40:00,850 --> 02:40:04,360
Well that's bill [inaudible] says that's
how he writes new bits. He's just,

2846
02:40:04,361 --> 02:40:07,180
I just, he goes, I just try to do
something I've never done before.

2847
02:40:07,320 --> 02:40:09,690
Yeah. That's smart. And, and that's how,

2848
02:40:10,170 --> 02:40:13,140
and then I usually come up with a
bit about it. I do that as well.

2849
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:16,530
Most of the time I do that just because
I want to do that for life more than I'm

2850
02:40:16,531 --> 02:40:19,320
going to try to write bits.
But I do think like when I,

2851
02:40:19,890 --> 02:40:21,120
like when I moved to Colorado,

2852
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:23,490
one of the things I thought of when I
was up in his fucking house in the middle

2853
02:40:23,491 --> 02:40:25,560
of the woods like this, I'm going to
get a lot of material out of this.

2854
02:40:25,561 --> 02:40:28,290
I didn't know it was going to get it
cause a mountain lion ate my fucking dog.

2855
02:40:28,590 --> 02:40:30,120
I didn't know it was
going to be like that,

2856
02:40:30,390 --> 02:40:32,280
but I thought I was going to
get some material out of this.

2857
02:40:32,281 --> 02:40:35,190
Cause it's such a completely different
environment, a different existence,

2858
02:40:35,191 --> 02:40:37,050
a different way of looking at the world.

2859
02:40:37,050 --> 02:40:40,280
You're looking at the world through this
incredible fucking boundless beauty and

2860
02:40:40,281 --> 02:40:44,610
nature around you all the time, you
know? But I just think as a person,

2861
02:40:44,611 --> 02:40:47,460
forget about creating
material as a person.

2862
02:40:47,461 --> 02:40:51,530
It enhances you and I guess having any
experience at enhances you was going to

2863
02:40:51,531 --> 02:40:54,270
make your art better. Yeah. You know,

2864
02:40:54,690 --> 02:40:58,140
this weekend I went pig
hunting like I said, and um,

2865
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:02,820
I shot this pig at about five 15.
Okay.

2866
02:41:03,240 --> 02:41:06,600
It was getting dark and I
shot this pig on an angle.

2867
02:41:07,080 --> 02:41:12,040
There was a hill like this. I
mean fucking super steep, right?

2868
02:41:12,340 --> 02:41:15,330
Like the most ridiculous slide ever.
If you were on it,

2869
02:41:15,331 --> 02:41:17,170
you can climb up it
and you can climb down,

2870
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:20,160
but you can't stand up right
to go down it. I went down it.

2871
02:41:20,161 --> 02:41:23,160
But you have to go on your hands and
knees and there's just a lot of spot.

2872
02:41:24,210 --> 02:41:28,290
This would happen. The pig was at the
top. I shot the peg and then the pig,

2873
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:31,920
Tom Doom, doom, doom, doom, doom,

2874
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:37,130
and went maybe three or 400 yards to
the bottom of this incredibly steep hill

2875
02:41:37,680 --> 02:41:39,000
and the pigs about 200 pounds.

2876
02:41:39,330 --> 02:41:43,200
So now me and Steve Rinella have this
decision to make. We have to figure out,

2877
02:41:43,201 --> 02:41:47,970
do we go up with the pig or do figure
out how to get the pig down and then find

2878
02:41:47,971 --> 02:41:51,630
another way and access to the road.
So we try two times to,

2879
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:56,110
to latch a rope to the pig
and then drag the rope, uh,

2880
02:41:56,190 --> 02:42:00,570
up with a truck. Okay. So we're trying
to pull this Pega, the ropes snaps twice.

2881
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:03,330
So because the rope is resting
up against rocks fucked up.

2882
02:42:03,610 --> 02:42:05,040
It didn't break the skin.

2883
02:42:05,130 --> 02:42:07,170
I mean they're not bulletproof
obviously cause I came it with a bullet,

2884
02:42:07,410 --> 02:42:10,170
but there their skin
is unbelievably dense.

2885
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:15,500
Wild pigs are some of the most durable
and toughest fucking animal ever come

2886
02:42:16,531 --> 02:42:20,490
across. Like they have these pigs that
have gotten shot by, you know, like a,

2887
02:42:20,491 --> 02:42:21,301
or a rifle.

2888
02:42:21,301 --> 02:42:24,630
Bullet goes through their leg and they
see them walking around the next day with

2889
02:42:24,631 --> 02:42:28,380
like a hole in their leg and they're
still eating and fighting with each other.

2890
02:42:28,381 --> 02:42:32,700
I watched him fight, I watched these
pigs, Duke it out in the, in the bushes.

2891
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:34,140
We couldn't get close
enough to make a shot,

2892
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:37,470
but there were duking it out in the
bushes no more than 10 yards from us.

2893
02:42:37,480 --> 02:42:42,060
And they're going after each
other and you look at them,

2894
02:42:42,061 --> 02:42:45,270
they've got these giant fucking tusks.
It was all bushes.

2895
02:42:45,330 --> 02:42:47,310
So there's no clean shot to hit them.
But it's like,

2896
02:42:47,580 --> 02:42:52,320
these are like Jurassic animals. They're
ferocious, crazy. We think of them as,

2897
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:55,470
you know, pigs as like, you know, oh,
there's a little cute little blankie.

2898
02:42:56,370 --> 02:42:58,580
Literally teeth bigger than your fuck.

2899
02:42:58,581 --> 02:43:03,270
You finger is growing out of their bottom
lip and they're these huge tank like

2900
02:43:03,330 --> 02:43:06,120
animals.
We saw regularly,

2901
02:43:06,121 --> 02:43:10,200
we saw a 450 pound pigs.
I mean, they're enormous.

2902
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:14,320
Giant, muscular, lien,
beefy fucking animals.

2903
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:18,970
And so you're seeing these things
all around you, uh, in this, in this,

2904
02:43:18,971 --> 02:43:20,020
in this crazy area.

2905
02:43:20,021 --> 02:43:24,540
And it just gives you this
ridiculous respect for nature.

2906
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:28,310
Ridiculous respect for this, this
world you've chosen to enter into and,

2907
02:43:28,311 --> 02:43:31,990
and have this little adventure.
So this, this pig gets shot, okay,

2908
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:36,700
goes tumbling down at after the
rope breaks twice we decide, okay,

2909
02:43:36,701 --> 02:43:38,380
this rope is not gonna
be able pull his pig up.

2910
02:43:38,410 --> 02:43:42,490
The rope is rubbing up against rocks on
the way up. And because it's so steep,

2911
02:43:42,670 --> 02:43:42,851
I mean,

2912
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:46,630
it's literally just grinding back and
forth on all these rocks and the rope just

2913
02:43:46,631 --> 02:43:49,330
can't take it. It keeps
snapping. So we did that.

2914
02:43:49,331 --> 02:43:53,680
We talked to the guide and the guide says,
let's, uh, drag the pig to the bottom,

2915
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:56,860
let it tumble to the bottom,
push it all the way down to the creek bed.

2916
02:43:56,980 --> 02:44:00,420
And then you guys could drag it out from
the creek bed to the road because it's,

2917
02:44:00,421 --> 02:44:03,820
it's pretty much down where the old
downhill the whole way. So you push it.

2918
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:07,150
So it gets to a certain point in time,
we realize this is not going to work.

2919
02:44:07,330 --> 02:44:11,920
It's hours later, it's pitch black
out. We see nothing but stars.

2920
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:14,140
And we have these little
headlight things on her hand.

2921
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:18,850
And we started hearing footsteps around
us. There's mountain lions in there, many,

2922
02:44:18,851 --> 02:44:20,680
many, many, many mountain lions.

2923
02:44:20,681 --> 02:44:24,850
Like they have at least 16 of them on
one trail camera that they got last week.

2924
02:44:25,140 --> 02:44:30,010
So one trail camera got at least 16
different big cats that live in this area

2925
02:44:30,011 --> 02:44:32,970
and we're pushing a bloody pig.
Okay. And so we get to the,

2926
02:44:32,971 --> 02:44:36,820
there's a picture of it.
So it gets to a point where we,

2927
02:44:36,821 --> 02:44:40,250
I'm smiling a little too hard for animal
rights. People change that quick. But, um,

2928
02:44:41,080 --> 02:44:43,000
so we get to a point where we realized,
okay,

2929
02:44:43,001 --> 02:44:46,870
we're going to have to do some about this
pig. So what Steve, I was with this guy,

2930
02:44:46,871 --> 02:44:48,850
Steve Rinella, who's the host
of the show, meat eaters,

2931
02:44:48,851 --> 02:44:52,690
a master hunter outdoorsman. Who by the
way, I like to think I'm in good shape,

2932
02:44:52,720 --> 02:44:55,050
but I'm in good shape. If you
want to do Jujitsu, all right,

2933
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:59,050
or you want to kickbox doing, let's not
like walking up hills. Like, I'm like,

2934
02:44:59,051 --> 02:45:03,400
that guy's a fucking Billy goat. I'm
a bitch. Do you want an hired? No,

2935
02:45:03,401 --> 02:45:07,810
I do a kettle bells. I do a lot of body
weight squats. I do a lot of kickboxing,

2936
02:45:07,811 --> 02:45:10,360
a lot of, um, in good shape
for that kind of shit.

2937
02:45:10,510 --> 02:45:14,260
But when you're hiking for like six,
seven hours in a row, I'm exhausted.

2938
02:45:14,261 --> 02:45:16,990
We're going up hills all the time. This
motherfucker is barely breaking a sweat.

2939
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:21,100
I never felt more like a bitch in my
whole life, but he doesn't rub it in.

2940
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:22,690
I appreciate that.
But anyway,

2941
02:45:22,720 --> 02:45:27,150
so we decided that we had to gut this
thing and then we had to carry it out in

2942
02:45:27,160 --> 02:45:30,460
pieces. And so we're at the bottom of
this fucking hill. It's pitch black out.

2943
02:45:30,461 --> 02:45:31,001
You look up,

2944
02:45:31,001 --> 02:45:36,001
you see a majestic blanket of stars in
this guy because to hone ranches way up

2945
02:45:36,461 --> 02:45:40,840
like 45 plus minutes from Bakersfield,
there's nothing out there, man.

2946
02:45:40,841 --> 02:45:44,920
It's just stars. There's
no light pollution. It's
just fucking beautiful man.

2947
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:50,140
But we're dragging this pig downhill
and we're sliding and I'm slipping and

2948
02:45:50,141 --> 02:45:54,430
falling and I got a half a pig on my
shoulder. Like we cut the pig in half,

2949
02:45:54,730 --> 02:45:58,000
he got one half, I got another half.
We took the head off and the spine out.

2950
02:45:58,150 --> 02:46:03,150
And so I have a literally a flexible
half of pig skin and a ham and a shoulder

2951
02:46:03,401 --> 02:46:06,700
and he has the same and each
one of us is probably carrying,

2952
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:10,700
I'd say at least 70 or 80 man.
I'm just guessing. I don't know.

2953
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:12,410
It's probably something along that.

2954
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:15,650
And we're going down hill with these
fucking things sliding and I'm like,

2955
02:46:15,980 --> 02:46:19,460
I could die. Like it's dark out. I
can't see what the fuck I'm doing.

2956
02:46:19,640 --> 02:46:21,950
I'm holding a flashlight.
He's got a thing on its forehead.

2957
02:46:21,970 --> 02:46:25,280
Is there a guide with you? Nope. Not
right now. No, not at this point in time.

2958
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:26,030
I mean,
we're just,

2959
02:46:26,030 --> 02:46:29,300
we have to figure out how to get to the
bottom and then go from the creek bed,

2960
02:46:29,500 --> 02:46:30,920
um, down to the road. Well, you know,

2961
02:46:30,921 --> 02:46:35,921
we're going probably a mile and we're
going in the dark downhill carrying 100

2962
02:46:36,441 --> 02:46:40,010
pounds of pig and it's crazy.
And while we're doing a hearing footsteps,

2963
02:46:40,260 --> 02:46:41,093
we're here in snap.

2964
02:46:41,120 --> 02:46:45,680
You hear like a twig snaps behind you
and turn around and you're like, oh shit.

2965
02:46:45,830 --> 02:46:47,590
You know, were armed,
you know, and you know,

2966
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,020
we're making a lot of noise and most
animals are not going to fuck with people

2967
02:46:51,021 --> 02:46:53,900
in the first place. It's just a little
too dangerous. It's weird proposition.

2968
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:57,080
You don't know what the fuck people
bring. People Bring Bang sticks, you know.

2969
02:46:57,470 --> 02:47:00,320
But while this is all going on and
I don't know what's going to happen,

2970
02:47:00,321 --> 02:47:03,770
I'm thinking this is a wild
scenario because I don't
know what's going to happen.

2971
02:47:03,790 --> 02:47:04,070
Yeah.

2972
02:47:04,070 --> 02:47:07,430
I hope I get to the end and I throw the
pig in the back of the truck and want to

2973
02:47:07,431 --> 02:47:10,100
go, whew. That was
exhausting. But we did it,

2974
02:47:10,190 --> 02:47:14,510
but I don't know because I'm sliding
downhill sometimes and I'm falling and I'm

2975
02:47:14,511 --> 02:47:17,720
like, this is, this is fucking,
this is a god damn adventure.

2976
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:20,780
But when it was all over like
the next day I'm charged,

2977
02:47:20,781 --> 02:47:24,560
you're charged because of that. Like
your whole body is like, you know, like,

2978
02:47:25,220 --> 02:47:28,850
like because you went through this crazy
adventure and it didn't know what the

2979
02:47:28,851 --> 02:47:32,700
fuck was going to happen. Yeah.
But then came out of it. Okay. You,

2980
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:35,240
you feel more alive.

2981
02:47:35,350 --> 02:47:40,100
Yeah. The other thing is you see
more. Yeah. In those situations,

2982
02:47:40,101 --> 02:47:42,950
because I always find like even with like,

2983
02:47:42,980 --> 02:47:45,440
I don't know if it's a guy
thing or a human thing,

2984
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:50,690
I don't notice my surroundings
after like my house.

2985
02:47:50,691 --> 02:47:55,130
I don't even, I just see the couch and
the TV. I don't see tape. I don't see it.

2986
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:58,190
It just, it all just goes away
because it's so repetitive.

2987
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,110
Right,
right.

2988
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:01,450
It's like when people are in their car
and all of sudden they find themselves

2989
02:48:01,451 --> 02:48:02,500
home.
I don't even remember it.

2990
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:06,280
Yeah, exactly. And the, and when you're
in a situation where it's all new,

2991
02:48:06,310 --> 02:48:09,340
you actually like, oh fuck, I have
to pay attention. I don't have,

2992
02:48:09,460 --> 02:48:12,910
well you have to pay attention because
you might die. But you're also just like,

2993
02:48:13,180 --> 02:48:14,200
you're just more aware.

2994
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:16,990
Right. So even if you like, we forgot
about a life or death situation,

2995
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:20,420
I wasn't really, I mean, completely
exaggerating if I say it does tuition,

2996
02:48:20,421 --> 02:48:22,340
but it was certainly dangerous.
I mean,

2997
02:48:22,341 --> 02:48:25,300
there was a lot of slipping and falling
and sliding downhill while you're

2998
02:48:25,301 --> 02:48:27,650
carrying all this weight. It's dangerous.
You could get hurt, you get hurt,

2999
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:31,370
you really hurt yourself. But even
just going somewhere you've never been,

3000
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:34,640
and exploring some new place
you've never been to, you know,

3001
02:48:34,850 --> 02:48:38,030
go to some new city where you've
never been in. Check out the sites.

3002
02:48:38,090 --> 02:48:40,730
All that stuff is enriching.
Yeah. Anything you're doing,

3003
02:48:40,731 --> 02:48:42,430
we can get out of your daily box

3004
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:45,840
and also just get out of the
same brain loop. The same,

3005
02:48:45,870 --> 02:48:47,700
just the same synapses are firing.

3006
02:48:48,120 --> 02:48:50,940
You know what I find really fascinating
when you go to places and the people in

3007
02:48:50,941 --> 02:48:52,530
those places have a different mentality.

3008
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:55,140
Like you can go to New
Jersey and New Jersey,

3009
02:48:55,141 --> 02:48:58,710
we'll have a specifically aggressive
type of mentality and then you can go

3010
02:48:58,711 --> 02:49:01,860
somewhere in Iowa where people
like you know, down home,

3011
02:49:01,861 --> 02:49:03,900
Midwest friendly folks and you're like,

3012
02:49:04,170 --> 02:49:07,830
it's so weird that they have
like very specific ways behaving.

3013
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:11,850
Like if you only knew humans, it's
like if humans were like, you know,

3014
02:49:11,970 --> 02:49:14,100
a type of animal,
like what's an ostrich?

3015
02:49:14,101 --> 02:49:16,710
Like if you meet it all their
fucking very aggressive,

3016
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:19,770
don't go near ostriches or
oh they're super healthy.

3017
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:23,730
They'll give you a homemade pie.
How can it be the same animal in the wild?

3018
02:49:23,760 --> 02:49:25,610
But with people you literally,

3019
02:49:25,630 --> 02:49:30,630
we really do find pockets of behavior
that's very consistent and very unique.

3020
02:49:31,480 --> 02:49:33,760
Yeah.
And it goes back to the thing of like,

3021
02:49:34,480 --> 02:49:38,560
why would you ever go to a city and
go like, Phoenix is a good example.

3022
02:49:38,561 --> 02:49:40,600
Or you know,

3023
02:49:40,770 --> 02:49:45,770
minute Minneapolis that's so fucking
cold or so fucking hot and you just go,

3024
02:49:47,081 --> 02:49:50,710
how did people decide to
stay here? Yeah, no shit.

3025
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:53,890
It's a weird thing of
like that 150 years ago,

3026
02:49:53,950 --> 02:49:58,950
some charismatic guy
probably just convinced like,

3027
02:49:59,591 --> 02:50:03,520
no, fuck it. We're staying here. Some
Dick slinging wizard. Yeah. Just like, no,

3028
02:50:03,521 --> 02:50:04,450
we're fucking stay in here.

3029
02:50:04,451 --> 02:50:07,720
And then they just figured out tray
trade routes and all that shit.

3030
02:50:08,360 --> 02:50:11,530
Like just whatever. There's a lake
there so they can, yeah. Yeah.

3031
02:50:11,531 --> 02:50:14,000
This is a good place to park their car.
There's just shit.

3032
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:15,430
There's like good facilities.

3033
02:50:15,760 --> 02:50:17,980
Well the crazy thing about
Phoenix is that Phoenix,

3034
02:50:17,981 --> 02:50:22,030
they did that shit before
they had ac. Like I, I like
Phoenix. I, I matter of fact,

3035
02:50:22,031 --> 02:50:24,670
I love it. I was just there last
weekend. I love hot weather. Yeah.

3036
02:50:24,910 --> 02:50:28,000
Phoenix is a great fucking town man.
Cause people are coolest shit.

3037
02:50:28,150 --> 02:50:30,700
They're super friendly.
They're, they're fun.

3038
02:50:30,701 --> 02:50:34,090
They don't take themselves too seriously.
They're intelligent. You know, like I,

3039
02:50:34,100 --> 02:50:37,630
that standup live, do you do that
place? Fuck, that's a great club.

3040
02:50:37,660 --> 02:50:42,640
That's a fucking great. But how did
those people ever get there? With no AC?

3041
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:47,200
Yeah, on. I honestly don't. I be
curious as to like what the, how.

3042
02:50:47,410 --> 02:50:51,340
I guess it's kind of one of those like
Jared diamond, guns, germs and steel,

3043
02:50:51,341 --> 02:50:55,980
things like the evolution
of American cities there.

3044
02:50:55,990 --> 02:50:59,200
There are obvious ones. Chicago's
on a lake. You can go through the,

3045
02:51:00,070 --> 02:51:02,080
but then there's once it's like Phoenix.

3046
02:51:02,140 --> 02:51:05,290
I have no fucking idea how it
ended up there. Too Hot to leave.

3047
02:51:05,500 --> 02:51:08,290
They got there and they're like, it's
too hot to go anywhere. We can't.

3048
02:51:08,710 --> 02:51:11,080
We shouldn't go.
We won't be able to make it out by sun up.

3049
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:12,350
This is getting this lake,

3050
02:51:13,120 --> 02:51:16,130
this lake and cool off and
then we'll figure it out when
it, oh, there's no light.

3051
02:51:16,550 --> 02:51:21,380
There's no way. There are no
lakes on a stream and this cactus.

3052
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:23,930
Exactly. Cool. My balls off.
That's why they're on the outside.

3053
02:51:24,530 --> 02:51:27,050
I got to get out of here buddy. Neil
Brennan. Get the fuck Outta here.
