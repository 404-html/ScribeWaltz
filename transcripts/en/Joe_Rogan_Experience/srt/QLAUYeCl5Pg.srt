1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,883
Ooh One.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,310
Yes,

3
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:02,911
we're live,

4
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,744
ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:08,210
UFC two or four or five companion
with my brother edge reprise here.

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,923
Hello.

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,410
First time ever in the fight companion.

8
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,460
Cameron Hanes is here.

9
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:15,330
Ladies and gentlemen.

10
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,164
What's up?

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,980
And of course Brandon
motherfucking show up.

12
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,920
Hey,

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,310
big bro.

14
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,650
And we're here live for the uh,

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Bisping versus Henderson rematch of
fucking huge fight for the middleweight

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,980
championship of the world and
Bisping's home town of Manchester,

17
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,341
England.

18
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:39,420
They are going to be going
off whenever law in that cage.

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,820
Never lost where?

20
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,280
Over there?

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,491
Yeah,

22
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:41,821
over there.

23
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:42,654
He's never lost.

24
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,530
Well Dude,

25
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:46,710
there's some serious love
for Bisping in Manchester.

26
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,910
When I went to Bisbing,

27
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,211
uh,

28
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:48,500
to,

29
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,830
to Manchester to watch him fight,

30
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,420
I remember thinking it was a match.

31
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,010
I've seen him fight a
couple of times in England,

32
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,700
I believe.

33
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,211
But when you,

34
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,170
when you see him over there,

35
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:55,680
you realize,

36
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:55,921
oh,

37
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:56,820
they just don't like them.

38
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,010
And certain parts of America that in,

39
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,060
in England,

40
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,550
he's gigantic superstar.

41
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,760
He's the reason why I'm in
May so big UHG over there.

42
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:08,670
Like you don't realize it because
it's been a bunch of times,

43
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,780
for whatever reason,

44
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:14,781
the fans turned against him and some some
events and here for talking shit when

45
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,710
he said the f Word Fag.

46
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,180
But in England it's different.

47
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,530
It's not the homosexual term.

48
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,460
It's like a cigarette.

49
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,060
Yes.

50
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:21,893
So when he uses it,

51
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,381
you know what I'm saying?

52
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,550
He didn't mean it in that tone.

53
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:23,821
Right.

54
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,250
But that's how he was saying it.

55
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,000
He wasn't saying it
like it was a cigarette.

56
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,910
He was saying that but,

57
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,040
but,

58
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,510
but over there it's a little different.

59
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:30,961
You know what I'm saying?

60
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:33,480
Like they throw it around
in a different connotation.

61
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,780
This is what you always understand
when it comes to trash talking,

62
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,280
when two dudes or trash
talking each other,

63
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,190
you cannot expect them to keep it PC.

64
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,671
Okay.

65
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,470
What they're trying to do
is humiliate each other,

66
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,640
his verbal warfare.

67
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,610
And you can't say that
that's his position on gay.

68
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,720
People know if he's,

69
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,640
I mean maybe it's rude for him to say it.

70
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:53,790
Maybe he's rude for him to insinuate
there's anything wrong with being

71
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:54,600
homosexual.

72
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,970
Definitely he's fucking with that guy.

73
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,970
You got to understand this is
not like a deposition in court.

74
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,460
This is not like his ultimate
feelings on homicide.

75
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,170
Donald Trump shit is concentrated fat
cause he wants to punch him in the face he

76
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,610
wants.

77
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:07,800
Yeah.

78
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,270
Hopefully it doesn't run for presidency.

79
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,240
Exactly.

80
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,210
We were talking about that
Trump thing where over here

81
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,701
it's like that movie,

82
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,140
the campaign with Will Ferrell.

83
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,180
You can't make this shit up.

84
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,070
How crazy is it?

85
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,200
A joke to say,

86
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,531
hey,

87
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,680
you better watch what you
say or murdered by Hillary.

88
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,731
That crazy.

89
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:30,120
It's a joke and everyone knows
it's got to watch what you say.

90
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,910
Hillary will kill Ya and that chick is
running for president and that's a joke.

91
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,150
Did you ever see that meme?

92
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,380
There's a meme of a deer laying on the
side of the road is dead and it said,

93
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,270
what did that deer know
about Hillary Clinton

94
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,243
thing?

95
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,241
Everybody's laughing.

96
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,074
I said

97
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,860
the only reason we would
laugh is because it's true.

98
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,450
That's the only reason we would laugh.

99
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:54,751
Yeah.

100
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:56,670
Wouldn't it be funny if
you did that about Oprah?

101
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,770
That's a point.

102
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,170
Funding all.

103
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,990
Totally true.

104
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,810
That really is.

105
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,220
There's,

106
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,700
there's that kid who
according to Wiki leaks,

107
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,540
according to Wiki leaks,

108
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:15,430
the kid who is the DNC leak was the kid
that got murdered outside of his place.

109
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,870
Damn Nigga got shot in the back at four
o'clock in the morning outside of his

110
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,780
apartment and according
to the Julian assague guy,

111
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,950
I don't know if he knows for sure,

112
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,160
but he believes that that guy's the,

113
00:03:26,161 --> 00:03:26,770
the leak.

114
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,960
That's the guy who sent the leaked emails.

115
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,560
She's us about them supporting
Hillary over Bernie Sanders,

116
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:36,040
like deliberately trying to get
Bernie Sanders out of the picture.

117
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,120
Cool as shit on Hitler and straight.

118
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,660
I'm just saying that gangster.

119
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,351
You know what I mean?

120
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:44,800
Yeah.

121
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,850
I'm not saying it's bad.

122
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,020
They're like Tony Montana.

123
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,620
Yeah,

124
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,890
yeah.

125
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,560
Well I'll do like Tony Montana
when you watch Scarface.

126
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,400
I did basically what Billy
Bill Clinton is like.

127
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,470
Look at this with Jamie just put up
there the missing hours of murder.

128
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,240
DNC staffer alone in a bar.

129
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,110
Guzzling beer,

130
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,150
depressed over trouble
with his girlfriend.

131
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,410
The wiki leaks,

132
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,840
linked analysts refuse to ride home,

133
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,700
refused a ride home and stack it
out in the middle of the night.

134
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,040
To his mysterious death.

135
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,320
Well that's a rough and just been,

136
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:14,591
yeah,

137
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:17,860
it have been just shitty decision
making it too convenient.

138
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,480
But yeah,

139
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,550
it has a little to that one.

140
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,290
A girl who got,

141
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
uh,

142
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,760
I think she got suicide and she was
going to suicides to find the Paula Jones

143
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:31,550
case with Bill Clinton and Paula
Jones back in the day and they,

144
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,650
she was going to be the witness.

145
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,484
Boom.

146
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,660
She gets a what?

147
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,590
Suicided bro?

148
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,380
Suicide in means you pretend
that somebody killed,

149
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,573
she killed herself.

150
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,100
Yes,

151
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,990
but they make it really,

152
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,850
really obvious that it wasn't a suicide.

153
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:44,200
It's like leaving a statement.

154
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,320
Do you guys remember the guy who was
the whistle blower for Enron who shot

155
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,510
himself in the head twice?

156
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,881
Sure.

157
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,710
Do they do that on purpose?

158
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,101
Twice.

159
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,934
Twice.

160
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,810
He shot himself in the head twice
and they said it was a suicide.

161
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,100
We don't see anything wrong with us.

162
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,270
Everything seems normal.

163
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,450
That's a general,

164
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,490
that's a real story.

165
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,990
Politics and you get suicided.

166
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,730
If you look into it,

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,250
it's probably going to be pretty obvious.

168
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:09,730
It wasn't a,

169
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,740
maybe I could see wiener commence.

170
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,120
No,

171
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,470
because he's not in office.

172
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,160
Who?

173
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,993
Anthony Wiener.

174
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,040
Just can't not send a
Jake brake dude's a freak.

175
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,060
I don't let it bother you
that for that first aid.

176
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:22,894
I'm not mad at it.

177
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,040
Don't have your kid in the bed though.

178
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,530
Post and Dick is not good.

179
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,030
That's what I,

180
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,460
that guy for sure.

181
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,600
She get into standup comedy.

182
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,760
I carried a powerful speaker.

183
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,020
He's obviously a mass.

184
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,160
I bet he's hilarious.

185
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,770
Did you see that Robert Deniro speech
about Donald Trump and he's been robbed

186
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,620
for 30 seconds.

187
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,590
He goes that scumbag on a fucking punch.

188
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,070
Ron,

189
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,370
uh,

190
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,090
Donald Trump and that face
because they missed last day.

191
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,091
No,

192
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,860
not exactly like that for sure.

193
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:54,694
Just,

194
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,070
just punch in Robert De Niro talks,

195
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,070
Talk Mad Shit

196
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,903
on Donald Trump.

197
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,720
Wow.

198
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,660
I got some good candidates.

199
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,460
Let's bring it to the beginning.

200
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,150
Jimmy.

201
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,810
Jamie is a message to Donald Trump and
put it in our here so we can hear this.

202
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,533
Oh,

203
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,520
can you do it?

204
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
Is it all right or no?

205
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,850
So blatantly stupid.

206
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,920
He's a punk.

207
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,540
He's a dog.

208
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,970
He's a pig a month.

209
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,590
Who doesn't know what he's talking about?

210
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,640
Doesn't do his homework.

211
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,420
He's an idiot.

212
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,950
Colin Powell said it best.

213
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:27,221
He said,

214
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,360
national disaster.

215
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,310
He's an embarrassment to this country.

216
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,700
It makes me so angry that this
country has gotten to this point,

217
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:34,690
that this fool,

218
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,650
this Bozel as wound up where
he has to edit the talks,

219
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:40,780
how he wants to punch people in the face.

220
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,603
Well,

221
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,170
I'd like to punch him in the face.

222
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,840
This is somebody that
we want for president.

223
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,853
I don't think so.

224
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,510
What I care about is the direction
of this country and when I'm very,

225
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:57,511
very worried about is that it might go
in the wrong direction with someone like

226
00:06:57,911 --> 00:06:58,960
Donald Trump.

227
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,760
If you care about your future,

228
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,310
vote for it teases

229
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,681
for Hillary.

230
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:05,430
He's an idiot.

231
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,641
Well,

232
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:06,451
before he didn't say,

233
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,284
he didn't say.

234
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,830
Now he's saying,

235
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,750
I mean we got a crazy choice here.

236
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,970
Donald motherfucking Trump and Hillary.

237
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,900
Holy Shit.

238
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,640
We know Hillary's crooked is
fuck the libertarian candidate.

239
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,570
That's a real option.

240
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,780
And he's reached as high as I think 20%
some states when people are scrambling,

241
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,600
this is the best time ever
for a libertarian candidates.

242
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,150
That's an independent and the end it was.

243
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,720
What was that meaning?

244
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,051
Well,

245
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,520
independent is libertarian.

246
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,880
Green party candidate is a
bunch of different people.

247
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,880
Jill Stein,

248
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:39,571
she's the,

249
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:39,871
uh,

250
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:40,710
the nominees.

251
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:40,831
He,

252
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:41,810
no one even hears about her.

253
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,930
She's a Green party candidate,

254
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
but she said some ridiculous
shit that drives me crazy.

255
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:47,190
One of the things I think she means,

256
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:48,720
well and a lot of a lot of areas,

257
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:49,680
but one of the things she said,

258
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,960
she thinks that 16 year old
should be allowed to vote.

259
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,681
Like,

260
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,160
are you out of your
fucking mind bitch at 33?

261
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:57,140
I shouldn't be able to vote.

262
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,790
I don't know shit about it.

263
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,260
I'm going to vote though.

264
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,010
You know,

265
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,281
I mean,

266
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,790
for sure there should be a reason
why we value your opinion and in,

267
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,161
in the,

268
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:09,690
the thing about voting as beautiful
is that everybody gets a vote.

269
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,230
But the weird thing about voting is
that there's a lot of us out there that

270
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,210
really shouldn't have a fucking opinion.

271
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,580
They just haven't researched it.

272
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,050
It's based on nonsense.

273
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,520
They just pick one side.

274
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,100
It looks like the better guy in the
movie and that's what they go with.

275
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,090
That's why Trump is,

276
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:25,830
I think is pulled ahead a little bit.

277
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,311
You know what I'm saying?

278
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,061
Or doing well,

279
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:27,751
not pull them ahead,

280
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:31,320
but doing well because
18 to 36 social media,

281
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:33,990
you see all the headlines,

282
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:34,381
headlines,

283
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,240
headlines is the Kim Kardashian effect.

284
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,110
There's all the Kim Kardashian
of presidents and there's
also a time and that

285
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:42,120
time is probably coming up very soon.

286
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,520
We're poles are no longer accurate.

287
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,440
There's because no one's taking them.

288
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm not taking them.

289
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,090
You're not taking them.

290
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,200
No one ever taking a poll.

291
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,750
Never still pull the people that
they're getting in there talking to him.

292
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a whole bit about it,

293
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,430
but there's,

294
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,230
it's like those are,

295
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,130
that's the real 1%.

296
00:08:56,131 --> 00:08:58,680
We should be concerned with the
1% where answer polls for sure.

297
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,240
Just let me text in my vote.

298
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,661
Exactly.

299
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,260
How about that?

300
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,093
How about my couch?

301
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,103
Exactly.

302
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,830
We have like Instagram polls,

303
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:05,131
you know,

304
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,300
and you can't progress.

305
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:10,170
You can't do any more Instagram activity
until you vote yes or no on this shit.

306
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:11,971
You know what I mean?

307
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,880
So everybody's got a social media.

308
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:17,670
They'd vote or a Facebook
and it's right there pops up.

309
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,200
You can't do shit just to,

310
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,810
you make that fucking boom.

311
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,351
Yeah,

312
00:09:22,351 --> 00:09:26,510
but she should want and you should want
to have an opinion based on something I

313
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:26,710
would say.

314
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,590
How does guys sit in Merseyside,

315
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,591
Beck,

316
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,790
Dick and rustled?

317
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,710
Dawn Russell don't.

318
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,010
And it's four 502450145449
of the first round.

319
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,610
So right now it's four 45 four 44 so our,

320
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,400
our sync will be like a few seconds off.

321
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:44,880
So you should,

322
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,650
if you want to sync up to the podcast,

323
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,250
just just pause your shit for a
couple seconds and figure it out.

324
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,000
Pitch.

325
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,980
I don't want you us to go oh shit.

326
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,060
And then you see it.

327
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,170
That does happen and it's
a bummer and I'm sorry,

328
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:04,130
how crazy is it that we have an actor
talking crap about a presidential can't

329
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,170
what?

330
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,590
And it and,

331
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,950
but he'll sway some boats too,

332
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:07,350
so it's like,

333
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,600
oh I loved him and go was going on.

334
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,440
So weird.

335
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,630
What's going on in this country is,

336
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,610
I don't even know what's going on.

337
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,780
I don't want to say no one does.

338
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,310
Dave Chappelle has a whole skid on the,

339
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,340
a while ago when when
September 11th happened,

340
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,280
he said he turned on MTV.

341
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,660
It's like,

342
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,680
I don't give a fuck with Joe rule thinks
about September 11th like he was all

343
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:26,514
over the TV.

344
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,180
Fuck is he talking about the CIA came
out and just crushed Donald Trump just

345
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,600
like that too.

346
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,700
Not like a gangster like he just did,

347
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,080
but a former director of the
CIA had to come out and say,

348
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,123
listen,

349
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,190
I got my issues with Hillary too.

350
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
He didn't get him to them.

351
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,721
He goes,

352
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:46,770
but Donald Trump,

353
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,750
if we allow this guy to be president,

354
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,010
it's going to fuck our country.

355
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:50,844
Basically.

356
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,240
I think you might even win
more now cause my hell no,

357
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,213
no,

358
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,200
really scared to death of Donald Trump.

359
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,130
That's what I'm seeing.

360
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,460
But it almost helps because
his name is out there more.

361
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,150
Right?

362
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,020
People are seeing it.

363
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:04,531
People are like,

364
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:04,681
Hey,

365
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:07,080
dinero is talking about a mom in some way.

366
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,531
Almost.

367
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,490
You're right in some way,

368
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,210
in my mind,

369
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,200
almost help.

370
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:10,711
But see,

371
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,544
here's the thing.

372
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,610
It's a long time before November.

373
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,260
I mean it doesn't seem like it is,

374
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,480
but it is in this weird climate.

375
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,580
Crazy shit can happen with these people.

376
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,810
How much more could come out?

377
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,110
What do you really think about Hillary?

378
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,760
I don't want any politician that's deeply
entrenched in the political system at

379
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,980
this point in terms of like who is,

380
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:32,730
who's,

381
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,930
who's influencing them.

382
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:37,860
Like she's doing things
like these speeches in front
of these bankers where she

383
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,990
gets paid a quarter million dollars.

384
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,350
You don't do those if
you're on the up and up.

385
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,840
That's just a payoff.

386
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,890
Like nobody wants to see
her talk for an hour.

387
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,641
Come on man.

388
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,610
She's not funny cause she's
saying something but I mean
she's going to motivate

389
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,470
you.

390
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,840
Rob Has beach all the dreaming
and how and people buy it.

391
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,420
This is like doesn't cook and shit.

392
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,511
Here's the thing.

393
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,220
It's like I understand what that means.

394
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,493
What she's like,

395
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,450
she's,

396
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,410
she's like the classic model
of the politician who is
not doing anything illegal

397
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,570
but it's distasteful when you look at it.

398
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,130
And in terms of like a whole system,

399
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,750
like the system of like these people
getting these jobs or people getting,

400
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,650
uh,

401
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,600
getting things based on whether or not
they donated or have donated to the

402
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,750
Clinton Foundation.

403
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,870
There's a lot of issues that people
were having a giant problem with.

404
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:26,770
And not me,

405
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,581
like someone said,

406
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,080
all you're buying into
conspiracy theories.

407
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,860
The Washington Post isn't a
fucking conspiracy website print.

408
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,450
They print a lot of stories about this.

409
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:35,170
Like there's,

410
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,550
there's,

411
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,610
there's a lot of people that don't like
the connection between some politicians

412
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,600
and some special interest groups that pay
them a ton of money to speak at places

413
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,280
like crazy money.

414
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,140
People are just tired of
politicians in general.

415
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,920
That's why they've gravitated
towards Trump once I agree 100% yes,

416
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,320
that's no one takes those,

417
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,750
those big speech monies.

418
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,500
You don't take that,

419
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,590
that big speech money.

420
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,110
If you're really concerned
about representing the people,

421
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,520
that's your own interests,

422
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,310
that's like there's a giant red flag.

423
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,780
Like it's sort of unethical,

424
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,620
but you're allowed to do it because
it's not illegal technically,

425
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,930
but God damn it seems dark.

426
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,170
If you're taking hundreds of thousands
of dollars from oil companies,

427
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:16,360
then you're making decisions whether
or not those oil companies are going to

428
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,160
profit or not based on a policy.

429
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:18,971
For sure.

430
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:19,730
There's a connection.

431
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,950
I'll tell you who's really fucked.

432
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,830
Trump's can be fun to Gill in Eric,

433
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:23,664
scrooge McDuck,

434
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,760
Billy Bush,

435
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,960
the other guy doing the interviews.

436
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,370
The guy who was super fucked,

437
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,440
Billy Bush was the guy who was in the van.

438
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,280
Have you seen the video?

439
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:31,000
I have it.

440
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,381
Oh yes.

441
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:32,830
I haven't seen anything
about this latest thing.

442
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:33,161
Excuse me.

443
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,690
Let's say a grab the pussy thing.

444
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:35,524
I don't even want to say,

445
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,900
oh,

446
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,350
look at this.

447
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,910
Hold on a second,

448
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,300
ma'am.

449
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,230
[inaudible] book got the back.

450
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,040
Billy Bush was the guy on the,

451
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:43,451
Oh shit.

452
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,284
He's got it.

453
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,501
Oh,

454
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:45,010
he's got it.

455
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,670
He's got a tap.

456
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,840
Oh boy.

457
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:49,240
We did the shittiest job
ever cover and that fight.

458
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,810
He was there before and he had fuck
got out and he's you guys back again.

459
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,710
Um,

460
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,150
I was balls deep in Billy Bush,

461
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,103
uh,

462
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,200
Bill Billy Bush and Billy
Bush who was talking,

463
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:00,220
he was the host and he's,

464
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,481
he's,

465
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,760
he's from entertainment tonight,

466
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,441
or he was,

467
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,160
see this,

468
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,993
can we

469
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,450
go into a seizure?

470
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,231
Well,

471
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:08,710
no,

472
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,310
Billy bushes,

473
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,630
the guy interviewed him and they don't,

474
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,340
they didn't know their
mics are hot and cop out.

475
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,090
Like,

476
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:13,570
he's like,

477
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,080
yeah,

478
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,470
he's like,

479
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,740
you know,

480
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,330
he's like,

481
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,210
how about this chick all,

482
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,044
how about her?

483
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,531
And you know,

484
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,280
he's Kinda,

485
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,330
he's fucked.

486
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,470
And then when they get out,

487
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,071
there's a,

488
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:21,341
you know,

489
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:23,920
it's a Ho a host who's an
attractive woman and he goes,

490
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,320
come on and give Donald a hug.

491
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,141
At least got to hug him.

492
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:26,890
And after that talk,

493
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,100
like,

494
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:27,251
oh,

495
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,570
he's a straight creep.

496
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,440
He's,

497
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,310
he's this guy,

498
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,383
Billy Bush.

499
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,800
When you recognize when you see him,

500
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,580
I bet.

501
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,271
Oh man,

502
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:34,750
it's just,

503
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,261
to me,

504
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,040
I just don't,

505
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,520
I just don't know how we got to this
point where that's our option now.

506
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:40,354
I know.

507
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,580
And I think it's the
outrage that people have.

508
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,530
I think this political system,

509
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:46,660
and I'm not obviously not
any kind of an expert,

510
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:48,400
but I think it's like a battle ship.

511
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,310
I think it starts moving and it
takes a long time to change course.

512
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,271
I think what we're now,

513
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:53,511
we're two,

514
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,390
we're seeing it change course and
we're seeing the people's outrage.

515
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,250
Outrage at our peak lately.

516
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,030
Yes,

517
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,150
they are Hillary winning in the Paul.

518
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,140
Yeah,

519
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,861
but you know what?

520
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,880
There's still outrage.

521
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,440
There's plenty of people that outrage.

522
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:09,080
There's plenty of people that are just
going to go democratic no matter what.

523
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,830
There's plenty of people that realize
that she's the better choice between the

524
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:14,740
two monsters like the leg,

525
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,440
her better.

526
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Even Arnold came out against Donald Trump,

527
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,074
but yeah.

528
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,040
Are you fucking kidding me?

529
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:22,540
Did he have a kid with the fuck

530
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,360
he was married about?

531
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,750
He was nice to them.

532
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:27,971
Oh,

533
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,460
those like as nice of them,

534
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,020
I gave them to sausage,

535
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,060
gave him that.

536
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,320
[inaudible] Trump.

537
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,431
He said,

538
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:35,640
dude,

539
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,473
in his voice,

540
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,580
I can no longer stand for someone.

541
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:38,941
I know.

542
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:39,840
All of us come back.

543
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:40,674
Then myself,

544
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,830
there's a line people,

545
00:15:43,831 --> 00:15:45,090
he had just crossed it.

546
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,031
Okay.

547
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,560
You don't grab the pussy.

548
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,601
First of all,

549
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,780
a lot of them would let you.

550
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,970
You just have to ask.

551
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,530
Just grabbing pussy left dude,

552
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,750
like grabbing pussy.

553
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,270
You're pro Hillary.

554
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,840
Hillary is a good woman.

555
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,370
She's just misunderstood.

556
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,790
Sometimes people when they are good women,

557
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,160
they wind up suiciding themselves.

558
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,220
The personalities is,

559
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,560
it makes you humble.

560
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,630
Swamp is a problem for

561
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,710
emails is not good.

562
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,440
What does Arnold think about those emails?

563
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,090
I don't know.

564
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,750
The status mail issues seems very complex.

565
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,720
I've got to go.

566
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,980
Not just a governor.

567
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,023
That was our governor.

568
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,560
He,

569
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,340
I love him.

570
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,173
He's my hero.

571
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,100
You know

572
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,150
the Bernie Sanders,

573
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,850
Hillary election rigging and all that
crazy shit that they just cover it up and

574
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,000
then you didn't see the
shooting in Orlando.

575
00:16:58,001 --> 00:16:58,421
Boom,

576
00:16:58,421 --> 00:16:58,600
Bam,

577
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,120
Bam.

578
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,130
I don't think that's true.

579
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,581
See,

580
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:05,210
that's a convenient connection between
330 million people in one spot and then

581
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,400
something bad happens.

582
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,470
You blame it on these
people that set things up.

583
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not easy to set things up,

584
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,100
but it is easy to take
advantage of those things.

585
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:12,610
Hold on,

586
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,050
hold on a second.

587
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,320
When it was a shooting happens.

588
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:14,621
First of all,

589
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:15,820
that's what everybody wants to see.

590
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,833
So the news,

591
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,780
they're going to cover it
and it does make things look,

592
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,130
it does lighten things up,

593
00:17:21,131 --> 00:17:22,900
but like here's a perfect example.

594
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,190
Do you remember Gary Condit?

595
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,630
Here's a perfect example of that.

596
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Gary condit was a politician
who was having sex with
his girlfriend who was like

597
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:35,050
a secretary or some shit like that and
she was really young and she turned up

598
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,660
murdered and he was under investigation.

599
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,081
Everybody's like,

600
00:17:38,081 --> 00:17:39,010
Holy Shit,

601
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,870
this guy murdered his politician,

602
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,340
murder his girlfriend,

603
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,590
and then nine 11 happened.

604
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:49,710
So to think that Gary Condit set up so
that he could get away with murder and

605
00:17:49,711 --> 00:17:53,790
his girlfriend is the same kind of
connection that people do when a nightclub

606
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,750
shooting happens with a guy who was
on the FBI terrorist watchlist group,

607
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:58,561
there were a couple times,

608
00:17:58,561 --> 00:17:59,091
a couple times,

609
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:00,780
he's a fucking nightmare,

610
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,621
crazy person,

611
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:06,030
and also gay going to gay bars and
he had a fucking truck loaded guns.

612
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,953
He was a nut.

613
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,910
The idea that you could get that guy
and recruit him and get him to do your

614
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:16,050
bidding on a specific day so that
it makes something else like g get

615
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,340
overshadowed in the news.

616
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,460
I think it's an easy way to fall in,

617
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:20,430
in that way of thinking.

618
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:24,720
But I honestly think there's just so many
events taking place that these people

619
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,150
are really good at manipulating the press.

620
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,750
They're really good at focusing the
national attention on things that don't

621
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,470
matter.

622
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,940
Like gay marriage is a big one.

623
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,400
Like how often does gay marriage come up?

624
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:37,290
Whenever there's like
a big political event,

625
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,200
less so now because it's so late.

626
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,280
But it was always like the beach ball.

627
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,010
They would bounce in the air whenever
they wanted to get something in the news

628
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,970
that didn't matter.

629
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,350
It didn't matter to most people.

630
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:46,740
Well,

631
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,610
we just came out,

632
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,410
uh,

633
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:48,750
uh,

634
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,750
the Pentagon just got busted for spending
$500 million to some British film

635
00:18:56,041 --> 00:19:01,041
making crew or per production company
to make a fake al Qaeda Taliban videos.

636
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,271
This is everywhere.

637
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,080
You can look this up.

638
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,010
Ron Paul's,

639
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:08,720
uh,

640
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,860
he talked hit sir.

641
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,151
Okay.

642
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,984
So,

643
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,683
okay,

644
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,853
let's,

645
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,480
let's find out if it's true.

646
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,950
Jamie pulled that shit on what that means.

647
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,311
Oh,

648
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:21,144
it's shitty.

649
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,920
But is it really true?

650
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:23,640
For sure.

651
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,121
Definitely.

652
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,420
Million percent make it real number.

653
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,723
It's sir,

654
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,140
they just got busted for days ago.

655
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,530
1000000% is so true.

656
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:33,420
If you read your mind,

657
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,163
let's just say

658
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,283
hypothetically,

659
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
what does that mean?

660
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,543
Kind of videos,

661
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,260
million dollars make it now
they just got busted VHS video.

662
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:51,210
That shit you saw the news $500
billion worth of it was fake.

663
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,650
But is that really true?

664
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,773
Which ones are fleet?

665
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,013
What if it is,

666
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,380
what's the website?

667
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm trying to find it that site first so
we can pull what is this website's not

668
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,660
a conspiracy theory.

669
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
Socialists website.

670
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,920
Oh,

671
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,660
you guys are what?

672
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,300
We don't know if this is a real
story because it's an incredible,

673
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,230
like what does it really mean?

674
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,690
It means that everything we
know about the Middle East,

675
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:17,730
like all those terrorists,

676
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,390
uh,

677
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,223
videos,

678
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,900
which one's $500 million
worth of [inaudible].

679
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,070
You're getting attracted to this before
you know whether or not it's real.

680
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,933
I understand.

681
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,880
I already looked at what will then
tell us a good website to go to that.

682
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,430
How about cloud is that
everything comes up.

683
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,001
Yeah,

684
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:33,721
but this is the thing.

685
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:34,411
More Google.

686
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,320
It doesn't come out.

687
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,913
What's coming up.

688
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,480
Maybe there's another way to Google it.

689
00:20:38,481 --> 00:20:38,721
What do,

690
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,730
what should we fake news?

691
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:41,901
Yeah.

692
00:20:41,901 --> 00:20:42,270
See,

693
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,370
see if on the spam things pop up on
your website called about fake news and

694
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:47,204
false.

695
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,190
500 million

696
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,023
should come up.

697
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:49,781
All the,

698
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,910
all the conspiracy theory websites are
jumping on this or you can't even write

699
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,670
jumping on email.

700
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:58,660
I don't want that.

701
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,360
Jesus said Isis alert.

702
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,350
Subscribing now.

703
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,184
Oh my God.

704
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,990
Fucking paranoid.

705
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,840
Collect guns.

706
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,390
Yes.

707
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,960
That's me making it look like
it was a Middle Eastern news.

708
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,980
Let's take a let's find out.

709
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,060
Oh,

710
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,960
this is real stuff.

711
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,471
They might,

712
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:15,320
how's it real though?

713
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:15,430
It,

714
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:15,761
hold on.

715
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:16,840
They might have done that.

716
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,400
They did know Eddie.

717
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:20,200
These these websites are horse shit.

718
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,590
Okay.

719
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,380
Like these aren't like the best website.

720
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:27,010
We have a website that said you
saved me from a bear attack.

721
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,520
That's right.

722
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,353
That's true.

723
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,200
I heard that shows a website that I
killed a mountain lion with my bare hands

724
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:33,430
outside the club.

725
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,710
I disarmed a,

726
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,700
an armed gunman Pentagon paid.

727
00:21:36,701 --> 00:21:36,941
Okay,

728
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,361
here we go.

729
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,440
Now rush it today.

730
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,460
Now this,

731
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,600
this is where it gets interesting because
Russia today is probably the one of

732
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,930
the most out of the this big pile of
people that are reporting on this.

733
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,080
This is a very legitimate news source.

734
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,150
It's kind of weird
cause it's Russia today,

735
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,860
but this is where Abby Martin was.

736
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,910
And uh,

737
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,420
they,

738
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,253
they,

739
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,180
they get away with a lot
more than anything that's uh,

740
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,310
on television in the United States
like CNN or something along with,

741
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,070
of course it's true
like I was telling you,

742
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:06,904
but what does it mean?

743
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,920
It means that everything we know,

744
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,540
but even if they know what they think,

745
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:13,870
some,

746
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,820
they faked a $500 million worth,

747
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,481
but any,

748
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:17,200
anything,

749
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,500
uh,

750
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,750
they keep anything that
they're showing me now,

751
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,890
it's what I like Daniel Pearl and his
family and all the shit about the Middle

752
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:26,560
East.

753
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,100
They faked $500 million worth of video.

754
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,401
Okay.

755
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:31,234
But we need them.

756
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,360
We need to really make sure
that this is a big thing,

757
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:34,660
right?

758
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,740
So we really need to make sure we
know what the actual facts are.

759
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,700
Just shot the pump when we just,

760
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:40,534
we need to know.

761
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,590
We need to know,

762
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,270
but he might be the truth,

763
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,350
but it might not be,

764
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:47,500
cause there's a lot of shit that people
get wrong and these fucking stories,

765
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:47,910
man,

766
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,330
and these things get passed on from
one person to another as gospel without

767
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:53,650
people like really looking into it.

768
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,400
But now it's really legit.

769
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,860
Said he's dropped it on that.

770
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,253
It might be,

771
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,710
oh we don't know.

772
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,330
Would you be surprised that it was a JV?

773
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,180
They're paid ready to
release this if it was,

774
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,643
what does that mean?

775
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,300
It doesn't mean I don't,

776
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,470
it doesn't mean much to me.

777
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,570
Well all the million millions of lives
of innocent civilians that have died in

778
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:16,450
the Middle East and still
bombed the twin towers.

779
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,033
Those people,

780
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,330
oh you fucked up.

781
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,503
Oh you fucked up.

782
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,480
Cause he doing this.

783
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,311
He's been,

784
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:24,820
he's baiting.

785
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,653
You

786
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,190
guys talked before September 11th
round Eddie and it's fucking,

787
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,390
oh shit.

788
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,440
Sorry.

789
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Didn't mean to pry.

790
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,560
But I liked this tower.

791
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,450
Seven is that's the most obvious.

792
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:38,770
So if someone,

793
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,990
if someone can look at a skyscraper,

794
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,720
go down at free fall
speed and send the video.

795
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,550
What conspiracy

796
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,550
theorists don't don't want to see about
tower seven and what it shows is how

797
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,540
slowly it actually fell apart before it
totally collapsed and there was a top,

798
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,060
there's a tower seven,

799
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,870
there's an exact to what he's doing is
the top to the building and it starts to

800
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:03,723
cave.

801
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:09,050
It's during the Trump video starts
to cave in minutes before it does.

802
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,540
It starts to cave in Manson
for the thing collapse.

803
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:11,991
Listen,

804
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,540
it doesn't mean that it wasn't
a controlled demolition.

805
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,910
Doesn't mean it doesn't still
look like I'll controlled.

806
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,051
It.

807
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:20,330
Doesn't mean it doesn't still
look like a controlled demolition,

808
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,070
but it's entirely possible because
there's diesel fires in that building

809
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,440
collapsed because it was
a piece of shit building.

810
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,270
Many experts have said it's impossible.

811
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,610
It's never had a pap right.

812
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,631
Have said that.

813
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:36,380
So you can't say it's possible and
experts are saying it's impossible.

814
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,300
Many experts are saying it's impossible,

815
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:41,330
but many other experts
are disagreeing with that.

816
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:42,743
I'm not an expert.

817
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,840
I don't know if they're
paid off cause he don't.

818
00:24:44,841 --> 00:24:45,770
You think that that would get out?

819
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,060
I don't know if they're paid off.

820
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:47,900
They might be paid off.

821
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,190
You might be right next to it might be
that the stuff that we don't understand

822
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,900
about what's common mother fucking sense.

823
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,661
You got it.

824
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,870
There's enough circumstantial evidence.

825
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:01,871
There's fucking video of the building
collapsing at free fall speed according to

826
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,790
the official story was free fall speed.

827
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,080
It's impossible.

828
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,750
I don't have an engineer and

829
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,760
you don't have to have
an engineering degree.

830
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:12,740
You don't have to be a professional,

831
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,880
a race car driver to know
someone's drag racing a car.

832
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,960
You could tell by seeing it and
you're hearing enough unbiased.

833
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,760
A structural engineers,

834
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,600
chemists,

835
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,200
but one after another band.

836
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,540
But here,

837
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,660
let me stop you for a second.

838
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,850
Them with common sense,

839
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,211
but Eddie,

840
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:30,230
let me stop you for a second.

841
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,340
You're only listening to the ones that
want to think that it happened that way.

842
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,940
There are a bunch of other
ones that don't think that.

843
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:38,570
See,

844
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,403
this is the thing

845
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:41,890
that's incredible.

846
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,610
That's fucking incredible.

847
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:46,460
I'm not a scientist and I'm
not a structural engineer.

848
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,010
So when there's a bunch of
structural engineers arguing,

849
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:52,700
you just have to have a third grade
education to see that fucking,

850
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,561
I can't remember what,

851
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:56,180
it's great when you go over bombing.

852
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,620
Great Shit that Stephan
Struve's about to fight here.

853
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,493
He's tall.

854
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,660
He's tall as fuck.

855
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,640
Change the subject case.

856
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:05,090
True.

857
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:05,691
Look at him.

858
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:06,524
He's tall.

859
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,471
Oh,

860
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:08,390
he's white too.

861
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,890
How do you say this?

862
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,251
Daniel.

863
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:10,590
Aman.

864
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,423
Check.

865
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:13,671
Check.

866
00:26:13,671 --> 00:26:14,391
He's not rip.

867
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:14,690
No,

868
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,051
he's never,

869
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,460
he seven foot for sure.

870
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:17,330
Pick up a basketball.

871
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:18,260
So you a giant dude.

872
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:19,094
And he's been,

873
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,450
he's been training a lot with Henry hoofed
training with the black zillions now.

874
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,800
I liked his pad work,

875
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,071
man.

876
00:26:25,071 --> 00:26:26,900
What did I say to move his last fight?

877
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,040
He got knocked out.

878
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,911
Is that what I know?

879
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,041
No,

880
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:29,874
it's last fight.

881
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,320
I think he won his last
fight on his last day.

882
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,180
He beat no guarantee.

883
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:33,861
Beat big foot.

884
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:35,510
He got knocked out by Overeem,

885
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,190
but I think that was three fights ago.

886
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,300
Correct?

887
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,430
And he probably,

888
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:40,701
yeah,

889
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,200
he knocked him out and he stopped him.

890
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,830
Give him seven foot.

891
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,550
Um,

892
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,140
I mean I think it's him.

893
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,650
He says how tall is nobody can
get up there to measure them.

894
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,130
So you have to,

895
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,900
I don't know why I didn't
take his word for sure.

896
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,250
Some foot just round that out.

897
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:54,270
I think he likes it that way.

898
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,633
All right.

899
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,090
A lot of digits.

900
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,110
I guess.

901
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,610
I know if he just stood up straight,

902
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,090
he was got a little bit of a slump for
a seven foot he seven foot for sure.

903
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,630
But uh,

904
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,810
he's a long dude and he
kicked Steve Bay from way out.

905
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,681
It's 20 steep.

906
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:11,040
I made a post about it saying like how
important it was for him to have lost

907
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:11,740
this guy.

908
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,320
Cause cause it was like,

909
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,790
it really burned the fire under him.

910
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,960
It was an important laws.

911
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,610
But he in the picture,

912
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,550
he's head kick and Steve
Bay from across the room.

913
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,130
It's so crazy.

914
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,351
Go,

915
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:23,350
go gadget stuff.

916
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,031
They said,

917
00:27:24,031 --> 00:27:25,170
I'm thinking to myself,

918
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:29,220
how the fuck is this guy kicking me in
the head from way over there for it.

919
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,310
It's a ridiculous,

920
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,320
crazy pictures.

921
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,420
See if you can find a champion.

922
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,590
Remember Strube had the hops horrible,

923
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:34,981
hardest.

924
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,510
She man where they thousand after retire.

925
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:36,661
Well,

926
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,990
I think he still has a heart issue and
one of the things he said is he did an

927
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,831
interview recently,

928
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,930
like within this last week that he said,

929
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:43,380
um,

930
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,101
I think that,

931
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:44,340
uh,

932
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,210
it's that I'm going to be able to prove
that you can win without a full use of

933
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:49,044
your heart,

934
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,850
like with a damaged heart,

935
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,010
which is crazy bitch.

936
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,013
Yeah.

937
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,640
I would assume it affects
cardio at some point.

938
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:57,410
My God,

939
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,420
if I have a whole heart and that bad
boys working on and have a whatever,

940
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,810
a whole in yours for sure.

941
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,700
He goes,

942
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,040
beers knows heart.

943
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,550
Do you guys remember Mills Lane?

944
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,811
Yeah,

945
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:10,720
he was the original company.

946
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,860
It's probably a tribute
to all his favorite raps,

947
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,520
yet willing,

948
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,370
when binge big John McCarthy
started doing it for eminent MMA.

949
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:20,970
They sort of had an agreement like John
would do it for MMA and he did it for

950
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,804
boxing.

951
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,153
Let's get it all.

952
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,360
It's a tough fight for Stru.

953
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:25,810
Yeah,

954
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,281
it's tough for them.

955
00:28:26,281 --> 00:28:28,590
People think really good dude.

956
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,311
He's very,

957
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:29,900
very tough.

958
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,000
Yeah.

959
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,350
I don't think he's ever been finished.

960
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:32,370
Only lost by decision.

961
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,820
I've never seen him wrestle big shoe.

962
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,381
So,

963
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:37,981
so big.

964
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:38,700
He's just,

965
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,200
as he's moving away from this guy,

966
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,530
you realize what a distance
gap between the two.

967
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,810
You don't see him use
his reach a ton though.

968
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,250
Look how much bigger he looks.

969
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:47,521
Well,

970
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,160
I think that's something that
working with hoofed will really fix.

971
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:50,910
I agree.

972
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,730
If anyone's going to be Henry who yeah,

973
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,060
and he's a fellow Dutchman to you.

974
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,743
No,

975
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,110
no,

976
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,191
no,

977
00:28:59,191 --> 00:28:59,341
no.

978
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,440
There's a whole triangle on Pat Barry.

979
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,190
That was amazing.

980
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,390
[inaudible] Presa yeah,

981
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,403
jumped.

982
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,070
I tell you,

983
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll tell you where I can see strip wins
by submission because think about where

984
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:12,390
are you gonna find a seven foot Jujitsu
guy to train with Schroeder to get ready

985
00:29:12,391 --> 00:29:13,110
for struve.

986
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,943
It's true,

987
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,450
but he could win by other things too.

988
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:15,931
You know?

989
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:16,830
I mean he can stay there

990
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,170
fucking picture.

991
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,310
That is so crazy.

992
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,970
He's kicking him from the
other side of the cage.

993
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,530
That is nuts.

994
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,030
I mean that's like a foot difference
between what Steve Bay can do to him and

995
00:29:30,031 --> 00:29:31,080
where he can hit Steve Bay.

996
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,990
That's crazy.

997
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,690
That's so hard to deal with.

998
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,240
It's the hardest thing to deal with it.

999
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:35,731
Oh,

1000
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:36,960
we just go into the left hand.

1001
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,940
You got to get them going backwards.

1002
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,590
Reaches the hardest thing to deal with.

1003
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:41,440
An all striking.

1004
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,010
Well,

1005
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,221
yeah.

1006
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,020
One thing that doesn't get tired as reach,

1007
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:44,420
right?

1008
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:49,330
Never gets 10 reached 10 inch
advantage and reach crazy.

1009
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,770
That's so big.

1010
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,933
It's so big.

1011
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,200
That's a giant gap.

1012
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,440
Yeah.

1013
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,191
You sure as fuck.

1014
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,350
Don't want to on that side,

1015
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,950
Daniel.

1016
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,380
Yeah.

1017
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,220
Gotta get in Bro.

1018
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,760
You can't hang back with this guy
because of the distance is so vast.

1019
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:01,100
Yes.

1020
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,850
Getting like do,

1021
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,330
do what jds did do what Roy Jones does.

1022
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:05,170
You get her.

1023
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,591
Sorry.

1024
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,830
Roy Nelson get in there
and just fucking dirty box.

1025
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:09,020
Oh,

1026
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,160
we just tagged him with that
left Hook and a right to left.

1027
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,510
Really thumped him.

1028
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,463
Yeah.

1029
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,490
Oh Dude.

1030
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,290
Throwing those casting punches.

1031
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,610
Fade or style.

1032
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,900
I like it.

1033
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,733
Yeah.

1034
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,840
Can't stay out there,

1035
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:23,080
man.

1036
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,630
Boom.

1037
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:23,920
Oh.

1038
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,670
Oh.

1039
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,510
Oh Shit.

1040
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,590
They're getting busy.

1041
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,513
Yeah,

1042
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,640
I know.

1043
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,100
He needs to keep that snoring and still
keep the writer almost want to take him

1044
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,790
down.

1045
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,001
Yeah.

1046
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,301
Oh,

1047
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:37,930
nice.

1048
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,870
You fucked up dude.

1049
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,341
Wizard.

1050
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:40,270
He's gonna step over.

1051
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,090
No backup Struble jump guard now.

1052
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,350
Oh it's to cry.

1053
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,340
Triangles are nasty.

1054
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,860
He will.

1055
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,680
His legs are so long,

1056
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:48,011
man.

1057
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:49,090
He can wrap you up.

1058
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,843
Yeah,

1059
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,370
he's got a real good guard but super
tricky Overeem got through that.

1060
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,840
You know when Overeem took him down,

1061
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:58,200
he knocked him out from inside his car.

1062
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,150
He did granted pen.

1063
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,470
Oh here we go.

1064
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:01,850
Beautiful.

1065
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,151
All that.

1066
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,610
But his Darcel steps steps over.

1067
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,790
See if he can get that mount.

1068
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,710
Got The half guard

1069
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,103
can be tough.

1070
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:09,411
Yeah.

1071
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:10,790
Almond check's not going to like this.

1072
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,840
This is not fun.

1073
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,040
Right?

1074
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,680
Daddy's on his back very often
and struve is so fucking long.

1075
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,980
Only big.

1076
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,110
Once you agree with this Eddie,

1077
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:21,470
he's so like sometimes I liked playing
bigger guys when they're this big and

1078
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:22,680
long cause you have so much,

1079
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,950
so much more room to
get out and like shrimp.

1080
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,090
Get the half guard,

1081
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:28,010
recover guard or stand up.

1082
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,330
Cause it was so fucking long.

1083
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,110
Does that make sense?

1084
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,580
It does make some sense.

1085
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,171
Make the holes.

1086
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:34,030
You me way Baker.

1087
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,581
Yeah,

1088
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:35,690
he's got a good arm triangle.

1089
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,440
Oh Shit.

1090
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,591
Yeah.

1091
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:41,591
He's putting the crunch down at time and
it looks like he's from half guard it

1092
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:42,630
now Daniel realize it.

1093
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:42,921
Yeah,

1094
00:31:42,921 --> 00:31:44,030
you're not doing that under Jack.

1095
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,820
That wasn't very sneaky there,

1096
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,361
but right here.

1097
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:50,570
If we could pull out his right knee and
then forced the recorder mount and then

1098
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:50,991
sit up,

1099
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,070
throw some punches and then
take this dude's back that,

1100
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,440
that's the Maya path right there.

1101
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,180
Free the knee.

1102
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,560
Go.

1103
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:55,680
Oh,

1104
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,513
he's going to do it.

1105
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:56,730
Look,

1106
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,470
is it set up?

1107
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,303
Throw punches.

1108
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,630
Rear naked coming up hot.

1109
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:04,880
Oh,

1110
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,850
most trying to set it up
because a lot of time.

1111
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:08,391
You got a minute.

1112
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:08,530
Yeah.

1113
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,860
Go and body triangle that for me.

1114
00:32:09,861 --> 00:32:11,450
Those through your seven foot.

1115
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:11,751
Yeah.

1116
00:32:11,751 --> 00:32:12,740
Why is he not doing that?

1117
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:13,741
You know what man?

1118
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:14,720
You guys don't lose it right.

1119
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,131
There you go.

1120
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:15,530
Look at that.

1121
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,170
Here you go.

1122
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,960
Sit over and did a good job.

1123
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:18,601
We turned into it.

1124
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,720
He did very smart.

1125
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,390
Oh well shit.

1126
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:23,631
Yeah.

1127
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:24,464
50 seconds.

1128
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:25,940
Come on,

1129
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,773
get door.

1130
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,520
Hmm.

1131
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,720
Yeah.

1132
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,270
I don't think it's ever
been finishing this turn.

1133
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:37,210
Let them mount again and as
soon as he sets up for a punch,

1134
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,920
give the back and then that'll kill.

1135
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,190
Knows the 20 seconds.

1136
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,293
Yeah.

1137
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,000
He's trying to enroll him in here.

1138
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,100
He's got the bug tracking on the top
rope and he rolls towards the body

1139
00:32:48,131 --> 00:32:48,521
triangle.

1140
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:49,720
He can roll into the choke.

1141
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,011
Okay.

1142
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:50,844
Not enough time.

1143
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,753
Yeah.

1144
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,113
Hmm.

1145
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,390
Wow.

1146
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:55,841
Powerful.

1147
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,520
Kevin Hart Logos on the Mat.

1148
00:32:58,930 --> 00:32:59,763
He's fine now.

1149
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,203
That's fine.

1150
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:03,690
Yeah.

1151
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,300
Yeah,

1152
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:04,680
that's true.

1153
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,740
Struve won that round for sure.

1154
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:06,900
Yeah,

1155
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,570
for sure.

1156
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,500
To control.

1157
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,290
Look at this crazy control he's got.

1158
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:10,830
He's like,

1159
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,041
oh,

1160
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,660
he's like almost in a twister setup,

1161
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,370
like an underneath or above twister sick.

1162
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,490
If he pulled off a twist or,

1163
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,540
I know you probably
could pull it off from a,

1164
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:19,374
sure.

1165
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,020
Let's get this boy is tired down for sure.

1166
00:33:22,021 --> 00:33:22,741
That's a great job.

1167
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:24,270
I strove struve is what?

1168
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:28,460
Two 62 65 has to cut to 65 Tazi.

1169
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:28,950
Yeah.

1170
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,783
Jesus.

1171
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,840
We had the same answer.

1172
00:33:30,841 --> 00:33:31,560
Lex Mcmahon.

1173
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
The key right there was truth.

1174
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,830
Got to cut the top half.

1175
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,930
You're going to have to
pass the whole guard at all.

1176
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,630
And then he forced three quarter mount,

1177
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:40,680
still didn't pass,

1178
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,870
sat up and before he throws punches,

1179
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:46,350
he actually ended up giving him the
mount and then he gave us backup.

1180
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,213
Anyways,

1181
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,340
he ended up on his back because the way
my is doing it is dude stays in three

1182
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:54,420
quarter mountain clamps onto your leg.

1183
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,850
Any punches dude covers up,

1184
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:57,960
gives him his back.

1185
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,860
Am I never technically pass the
guard so we didn't lose tonight.

1186
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:02,730
I'm going to diet coke.

1187
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,703
Whoa.

1188
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,553
I'm crazy.

1189
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:05,940
Crazy.

1190
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,773
Don't judge me.

1191
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,800
Don't judge me.

1192
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,790
It's got caffeine.

1193
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,430
I know you're trying to avoid caffeine.

1194
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,353
Hell No.

1195
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:14,110
Courage the canvas saying it's a drug.

1196
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,350
Oh it isn't drug addicted to coffee.

1197
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:17,670
So just say no to drugs.

1198
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:17,840
Hey.

1199
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,430
So he wanted to the uh,

1200
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,380
instead of punching sand on top,

1201
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:22,711
you know,

1202
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:23,311
full amount.

1203
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,470
He wanted to go for the submission.

1204
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,070
You think that that's where he's better?

1205
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:26,641
No,

1206
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,474
that's true.

1207
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,740
Giving them the option.

1208
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:29,570
We'll give them the bat.

1209
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,110
The guy you could give your back.

1210
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:31,750
Okay.

1211
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,340
Anybody?

1212
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:32,790
Yeah,

1213
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,710
it's fucking spot.

1214
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,160
Easily,

1215
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,920
cause everyone's going to
let me go to the worst spot.

1216
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,230
But sometimes in this sport you
can't hit to the back of the head.

1217
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,650
So now the worst spot is kind
of the same spot because yeah,

1218
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:46,500
the only thing that's showing is the
back of my head and you can get it right.

1219
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,690
Most wrestlers turn.

1220
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:47,851
Yeah,

1221
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:48,570
that would be done.

1222
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:51,450
And one thing did you got to take into
consideration whenever you see a fight

1223
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,630
and there's a ground exchange and there's
a submission attempt versus a ground

1224
00:34:54,631 --> 00:34:55,260
and pound,

1225
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,760
it's not right or wrong.

1226
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,010
It's like what he thought
was there at the moment.

1227
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,890
Beautiful thing about MMA is it
all of these options are available.

1228
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,900
Is it some people like cro,

1229
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,990
cop's knock out of Gabriel
Gonzaga from inside the guard.

1230
00:35:06,991 --> 00:35:09,020
It was devastating elbows
from inside of the guard.

1231
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:14,021
It's like the first time we got to see
like a world class striker who's gotten

1232
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:15,420
way better at wrestling,

1233
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:15,700
right?

1234
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:15,760
Yeah,

1235
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,000
your boy way better at grappling.

1236
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,320
Way Better for doom.

1237
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:22,260
Helped them out a ton to the
grill when he fought Gonzaga,

1238
00:35:22,261 --> 00:35:25,730
those elbows were so nasty level.

1239
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,880
Really right on the UFC.

1240
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,600
There was so next level it's like taking
a guy like a mallet pet or something

1241
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:30,990
like that.

1242
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,500
Or like,

1243
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:31,740
uh,

1244
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,041
you know,

1245
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,510
I guess you know bull cow.

1246
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,860
Yeah.

1247
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,180
And putting one of those guys,

1248
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:39,060
like that level you would
see from devastating,

1249
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,820
devastating results inside the guard.

1250
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,540
So that's,

1251
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,460
that's the right way to do it for him.

1252
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,070
God,

1253
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,960
I'll look at that.

1254
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,710
That's nice.

1255
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,490
Oh Shit.

1256
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,260
He's on top.

1257
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,630
What's going?

1258
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,330
That's called smell my,

1259
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,130
but yep.

1260
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,060
That's not a move.

1261
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,523
He doesn't move.

1262
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:53,981
He's not.

1263
00:35:53,981 --> 00:35:54,270
Dot.

1264
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,910
I'm surprised.

1265
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,630
Darson from fracking.

1266
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,040
Oh,

1267
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,991
that was beautiful.

1268
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:03,840
Look how tiny got came against.

1269
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:05,160
The cage is trap.

1270
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,053
Oh look at this dude.

1271
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,110
This dude is so game.

1272
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,310
He's so game

1273
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,040
be tapped them.

1274
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,660
Super impressed.

1275
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,630
That was super impressed with that
submission and super impressive how game.

1276
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,140
That dude is how we roll.

1277
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,440
Let me,

1278
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,880
he was stuck and getting strangled,

1279
00:36:19,881 --> 00:36:24,120
a neck cracked and he kept
rolling and help him out at all.

1280
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:24,954
Not at all.

1281
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,591
I see.

1282
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:26,670
That's what I've been saying to you,

1283
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:27,300
man.

1284
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,230
No Kale

1285
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,570
fighting.

1286
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,330
All right dude.

1287
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,510
You want to sell it on on air,

1288
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,111
ladies and gentleman,

1289
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,260
this is the Dana White or by organization.

1290
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,060
We have to do it on an Indian reservation.

1291
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,451
Okay,

1292
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:43,284
let's do it.

1293
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,390
I'm a big fan of the
native American people,

1294
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:46,890
so let's make it happen.

1295
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,450
If they could clear off one night,

1296
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,970
nice football field size Matt area for us,

1297
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,450
we just do that at like
a football stadium.

1298
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,091
You know what you do?

1299
00:36:55,091 --> 00:37:00,091
You have a black sheep
blackground blackground like
the center is black and then

1300
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,180
you have a,

1301
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,760
an enormous white area.

1302
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,080
When you get to the white area,

1303
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:06,810
it's understood that unless
shit is getting crazy,

1304
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,000
break it off.

1305
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,330
You go back to the black area.

1306
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:10,800
So you have a giant white area.

1307
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,610
So even the white area where
like say if you like you,

1308
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,280
he sunk the Darce right there and he
rolled but he rolled into the white area.

1309
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,603
You're breaking them up.

1310
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:18,860
No,

1311
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,561
you got plenty of time.

1312
00:37:19,561 --> 00:37:20,394
You can keep rolling.

1313
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,611
So,

1314
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:23,250
but it's understood that if
you're in the white area,

1315
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:27,180
move back to the dark hair and if you
try to like stay on the edge of the white

1316
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:27,391
area,

1317
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,141
people call you a pussy.

1318
00:37:28,141 --> 00:37:28,651
There it is.

1319
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:28,921
Hell,

1320
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:29,754
look at this.

1321
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,220
Is this a fight in a football field?

1322
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,780
Oh my God.

1323
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,473
Of course they do.

1324
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,740
You know what?

1325
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,573
We can do it.

1326
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,810
Holy Shit.

1327
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,060
What the fuck?

1328
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,960
MMA fighting a football field.

1329
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,820
There's seven people there.

1330
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,910
There's not that many people do it there,

1331
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,170
but this is a great move and Russia,

1332
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,740
Russians always have the best moves.

1333
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,990
Fantastic.

1334
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,401
Oh my God.

1335
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:01,200
This is how the board should be played.

1336
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,083
No,

1337
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,700
they're going to stay in
like a 10 foot area probably.

1338
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,750
Oh my God.

1339
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,760
This is exactly how
fight should take place.

1340
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,690
Now that I see it,

1341
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,630
I'm so right.

1342
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,280
This is so that he,

1343
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,000
here's a better thing to it.

1344
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,460
It would be better for them to fight in
the grass then it would be for them to

1345
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,363
fight.

1346
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,080
Yes.

1347
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,710
Better.

1348
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:22,921
No,

1349
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:23,580
it's itchy.

1350
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:23,821
No,

1351
00:38:23,821 --> 00:38:26,130
it's perfect because it's fucking raw.

1352
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:27,920
It's natural dirt.

1353
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,880
Some rocks and sand.

1354
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:33,990
We've got to do it in sand.

1355
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,990
I'm pretty sure this no rounds to

1356
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,380
play football,

1357
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
soccer on the grass,

1358
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,531
no round.

1359
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:44,770
They just go to [inaudible]
[inaudible] go off at school.

1360
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,710
Dirty feet and everybody's
dirty feet and everything.

1361
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,430
And Russia.

1362
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,630
It might be battle to the death.

1363
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:53,810
Yeah,

1364
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:54,190
they might.

1365
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,120
One of them might die.

1366
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:55,511
Well,

1367
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:56,291
you know what they could do?

1368
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,830
One show would have a battle to the
death and then everybody else would feel

1369
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:00,460
like a pussy.

1370
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:00,910
That was,

1371
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,360
that would,

1372
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,141
that would be the,

1373
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:02,860
uh,

1374
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,131
yeah,

1375
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,540
the headliner would be a one up or,

1376
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,100
yeah,

1377
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,500
it would be every fight we'd be battle.

1378
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:07,830
The desk guys are,

1379
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,330
you're talking about clay gladiator days?

1380
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,780
Yeah.

1381
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,613
I mean we're going back,

1382
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,010
but they did do that.

1383
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:14,830
Everybody else would feel like a pussy
in Russia because they're so gangster,

1384
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,501
man.

1385
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:16,081
They got something good.

1386
00:39:16,081 --> 00:39:16,280
Like,

1387
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,470
I wonder if Putin would fight.

1388
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,511
He wouldn't fight,

1389
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:21,920
but his body guard would he
really have a killer body armor.

1390
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,490
Crazy body tattoos takes it off.

1391
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,170
It's all just trying
to go from full guard.

1392
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,700
Oh Shit.

1393
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,630
Poop would fight,

1394
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:29,620
but he'd just have it rigged.

1395
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,470
So the guy who just does
these guys are super talented.

1396
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,304
These are good fighters.

1397
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,650
And I liked the concept ban.

1398
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,540
When did this take place where Jamie,

1399
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,640
when did I rip this idea?

1400
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,490
These guys are way too high level for,

1401
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:46,030
this is in Boston 2020 it says

1402
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,363
interesting everybody.

1403
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,090
Yeah,

1404
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,440
there's no way that could be like,

1405
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,230
isn't it funny that you could
look at some MMA fights and go,

1406
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:56,290
oh that's definitely
not before 2000 oh yeah.

1407
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:56,790
Easy.

1408
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,220
Yeah.

1409
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,270
Isn't that interesting though?

1410
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,640
Like that's how quick that
this sport has evolved.

1411
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,110
Like I can look at a guy,

1412
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:04,150
I can look at some fights from,

1413
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,700
you know,

1414
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,610
you say it's like a world title fight.

1415
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:06,941
If you get,

1416
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:07,691
you look at it and go,

1417
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:07,781
oh,

1418
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:11,350
this has gotta be like 1997
[inaudible] 98 you know,

1419
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,700
and then you look at even like,

1420
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,320
I think I would,

1421
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,510
doesn't get enough love Marlin Murrayas
world series of fighting that Bantam

1422
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:18,344
weight division,

1423
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,040
bad motherfucker just fighting
the world series of fighting.

1424
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,110
But he's world championship level.

1425
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:23,921
Like you look at him and go,

1426
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,840
that's what I expect
out of a world champion.

1427
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,100
He said just a master striker
or combination grappler.

1428
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:32,110
He's a real solid MMA fighter.

1429
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,651
Nasty,

1430
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:33,484
nasty fighter.

1431
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,370
He's fighting now I think starting
in world series of fighting.

1432
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,443
Did they make,

1433
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,800
what's the money compared to the UFC?

1434
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:39,430
You don't know.

1435
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:43,240
But a lot of guys from the UFC like day
branch just fought Vinny Magallanes I

1436
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,230
don't know who won that fight.

1437
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,100
Do you know who won that fight?

1438
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,570
David Branch one I decision.

1439
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,500
You wanted decision?

1440
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,020
Dude branch is awesome
but very good guy too.

1441
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:50,801
Very good fighter.

1442
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:55,620
And Him and Vinny were both in the
UFC so they got a lot of guys jumped.

1443
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
John Howard Posner,

1444
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,920
rs and then they also got uh,

1445
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,350
uh,

1446
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,600
my boy Jake shields and Fitch.

1447
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,171
Fitch.

1448
00:41:02,171 --> 00:41:03,004
That's a good fine.

1449
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,200
That is the same night
as the UFC fight in 'em.

1450
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,410
I think it's the same night as
the UFC fight in New York City.

1451
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,940
But you fucked up world series.

1452
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,310
That's,

1453
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,620
that's a tough draw.

1454
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,410
They get to the weekend.

1455
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,670
Everyone fucked up.

1456
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,061
Yo,

1457
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:16,250
wait,

1458
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:16,630
let's go.

1459
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,650
Let's get busy with this.

1460
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:19,480
What do you think about this Brendan Shop?

1461
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,920
I am very excited about this fight.

1462
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,950
I think people are fucking
sleeping on Eddie Alvarez.

1463
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,480
I think he's a dangerous,

1464
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:29,290
dangerous 155 pounder that
motherfucker can punch.

1465
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,520
He punches hard,

1466
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,660
he's fast as fuck.

1467
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:34,400
And it does not a human alive
that's more game than that kid.

1468
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,310
I agree 100% that do to you if
you've never seen him fight before.

1469
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:40,730
You got to watch his fights in Bella
toy with chandeliers and dream.

1470
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,890
She just fights him dream.

1471
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,980
And Michael Chandler is another dude
who's out there who is world class that

1472
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,500
could easily be fighting
and winning in the UFC.

1473
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,510
And you see it now with Eddie Alvarez.

1474
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:53,570
Cause it took a while for Eddie
to get comfortable in the UFC.

1475
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,320
He,

1476
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,040
Donald worked him over and his
first fight because dismantled,

1477
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:57,650
budge on.

1478
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,970
But now he's training
with your book Mark Henry.

1479
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,340
And look,

1480
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,030
Connor's a goddamn phenom.

1481
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,560
And he's uh,

1482
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,860
he's got as for Rasa,

1483
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:10,040
hobby lexicon at the touch
of death in his hands.

1484
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,120
That's a scary fight,

1485
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:11,301
man.

1486
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:14,870
Anyone who thinks it's a easy fight or
not a big fight for Conor is they just

1487
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:17,360
don't know the sport out of their
time on the underground king,

1488
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:21,440
I think at 55 and everyone knows I'm the
biggest con or nut writer in the world

1489
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,620
at 55 I just don't see
a ton of success there.

1490
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,970
I think Eddie Alvarez,

1491
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:27,170
if you look at the top five,

1492
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:27,861
we've talked about this before,

1493
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:28,694
you're like the top five.

1494
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,500
It's his easiest matchup and that's a
fucking nightmare for him cause he can

1495
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:34,700
grapples ass off.

1496
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,470
He's been so many big fights.

1497
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,730
It doesn't get tired.

1498
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,560
He doesn't mind winning by decision.

1499
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:42,170
He doesn't get tired and
he's a bigger grandpa.

1500
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:42,370
Yeah,

1501
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,370
those are two and he can't fucking crack
and look at his resume and just resume

1502
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,230
crisp man.

1503
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,580
He's got crisp striking.

1504
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,290
He's not an easy guy to hit.

1505
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,040
You know you can hit him and
he gets rocked and he survives.

1506
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,630
If you watch his Chandler fights,

1507
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,190
Eddie Alvarez got rocked and survived
against Chandler and a couple other guys

1508
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:02,630
over in Bella to think about how,

1509
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,640
how's Connor win this fight?

1510
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,120
You go through it has to knock him out.

1511
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,260
He has five rounds and document.

1512
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,670
You're not winning decision against that.

1513
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,660
He could win a decision.

1514
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:09,440
I don't think so.

1515
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,921
I disagree.

1516
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,320
Why do you worry about the
fight with Gilbert Melendez?

1517
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,240
Eddie wanted decision
in the Gilbert Melendez.

1518
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:14,600
Fine.

1519
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,931
Oh No,

1520
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:16,270
I'm saying Edwin's by decision.

1521
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,640
Right.

1522
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,280
You don't think that Connor could
beat him in a similar fight?

1523
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,940
No.

1524
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,330
No.

1525
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,490
You don't get the same dances.

1526
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,071
The endurance,

1527
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,250
the takedowns to grappling with
the striking as the rounds go on,

1528
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,360
the knockout power goes down.

1529
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,400
Do you think people sleep
on Alvarez wrestling?

1530
00:43:28,401 --> 00:43:29,300
Cause I think they forget,

1531
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,630
I forget how good of a wrestler.

1532
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,820
His and his insurance.

1533
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,360
It's a steering college.

1534
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,303
Where did he wrestle?

1535
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,930
He was a high level guy.

1536
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,123
Yeah,

1537
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:38,963
Division One.

1538
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,063
All American.

1539
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,061
I'm not sure.

1540
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:41,840
But uh,

1541
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,601
compared to Connor,

1542
00:43:42,601 --> 00:43:43,670
he's fucking Dan Gable.

1543
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:43,941
Yo,

1544
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:44,774
this fight,

1545
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,980
this fight is nasty,

1546
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:46,850
right?

1547
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,631
We all know that.

1548
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:48,291
Those guys,

1549
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:48,620
I mean this is,

1550
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,670
we're talking about Jimmy man.

1551
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,983
It's about to go down.

1552
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,770
No,

1553
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,880
I'm saying this fight's nasty.

1554
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,560
Just does not confused people at home.

1555
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:55,530
But I,

1556
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,630
I agree with you man.

1557
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:57,890
I think people sleep on them.

1558
00:43:58,190 --> 00:43:59,010
It's easy.

1559
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,960
You've rolled with like a real division
one wrestler and you realize how fucking

1560
00:44:02,961 --> 00:44:05,750
strong the wrestling is all American.

1561
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:06,531
Uh,

1562
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,410
that's high school,

1563
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:08,841
National Prep,

1564
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:09,674
all American.

1565
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:11,421
What is,

1566
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,170
um,

1567
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,660
what does his college wrestling record?

1568
00:44:13,661 --> 00:44:14,480
It doesn't have one yet.

1569
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,470
No college wrestling.

1570
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,360
It doesn't say as college wrestling.

1571
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,440
And he got us rustling and fricking dream.

1572
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:22,274
How about that?

1573
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,680
He bypassed that career
and went right into MMA.

1574
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,720
So he wasn't high level
high school Russell,

1575
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:32,430
which is not as impressive
as a college wrestler.

1576
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,290
But when you see him wrestle,

1577
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,681
you know,

1578
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:35,760
he's got some skills.

1579
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,590
Does he like to stand up though?

1580
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,920
He loves standard trade and get
back on and just wants to stand up.

1581
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:41,880
Obviously he's too smart.

1582
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:43,290
He's been in some with some of the best,

1583
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:43,591
you know.

1584
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:45,510
So Connor is not an easy take down though.

1585
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:47,300
Even now to high school champ.

1586
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,790
Chad Mendez begs to differ times or,

1587
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,030
I mean as time goes on,

1588
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,090
he's going to be harder
and harder to get that.

1589
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,400
Chad Mendez fight though
in Connor's defense,

1590
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,920
he had a pretty fucked up knee and
that fight and he was shooting.

1591
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,870
He was getting stem cell
injections in his knee,

1592
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:03,330
but that's also the only
wrestle we've seen Conor fight.

1593
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:03,960
It's true.

1594
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,970
Taken down pretty effort loosely.

1595
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,451
Yeah,

1596
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:06,841
that's true.

1597
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,130
Then that's the only,

1598
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,010
that's the only thing we
can go off of it and say,

1599
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,830
I got a bad knee.

1600
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,663
I get that.

1601
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,841
It's a tough fight,

1602
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:13,080
man.

1603
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,210
But people think congressmen
walked those guys.

1604
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,230
They don't know the sport,

1605
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:16,560
man.

1606
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,370
I saw the violent,

1607
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,210
oh fuck.

1608
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:18,780
It's true.

1609
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,040
But also I could see
Connor just smirking ham.

1610
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:22,800
Oh yeah.

1611
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,940
That's how common is going to win.

1612
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,300
He's going to,

1613
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,421
if,

1614
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:25,231
if Connor wins,

1615
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,050
he's going to Mirko.

1616
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,980
Connor has some vicious
fucking power in his hands.

1617
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:30,270
Has Ed been knocked out?

1618
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,713
He's been stopped.

1619
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,420
He Chandler stopped me rear naked,

1620
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:35,310
choke him and beat him for the title.

1621
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,900
I'm knocked out.

1622
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,400
I don't think he's been knocked out.

1623
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,313
I do not think so.

1624
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,730
Some dog fights.

1625
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,350
He's just his game as they come.

1626
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,920
I think he's one of those guys that
fights at his very best when he's scared.

1627
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:47,260
Correct.

1628
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,400
I think that's going to be one of the
best things about this fight is that he

1629
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:52,130
thinks Conor is a dangerous motherfucker.

1630
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,320
Just like he thought hot failed Dos
Anjos he stopped though sign jokes in the

1631
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:55,920
first round.

1632
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,180
And a lot of people,

1633
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,080
including me,

1634
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,980
we're making the argument that Dos Anjos,

1635
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,620
if you look at the guys he's beaten,

1636
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,410
stop cowboy in the first round,

1637
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,970
beat the shit out of Nate Diaz,

1638
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,740
had us beat Pettis up,

1639
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,490
stopped.

1640
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:08,820
Uh,

1641
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,620
Ben Henderson crushed him.

1642
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:10,981
I mean,

1643
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,600
you look at all the guys that he's beaten,

1644
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,480
there's a real argument that he's one
of the best lightweight of all time.

1645
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,120
And then Eddie went and
stopped him in the first round,

1646
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:19,620
so I thought he was gonna get murdered.

1647
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,041
Like you went,

1648
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:20,660
thought Eddie was just,

1649
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,470
you can get it shows a huge,

1650
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:26,010
he doesn't have the marquee
name recognition type thing.

1651
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:26,720
They don't know him yet.

1652
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,250
Dangerous fight for economy
because he has such a big name.

1653
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,113
But yeah.

1654
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,313
What if,

1655
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,161
if Connor does,

1656
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:35,220
when you imagine the 55 belt
holder is crazy and the,

1657
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,773
and the flat,

1658
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,400
and then I think you'll forget about Tony.

1659
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,530
Tony.

1660
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:39,690
Well,

1661
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:39,811
no,

1662
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:41,040
we're not forgetting about them for sure,

1663
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,550
but I think the thing about Eddie Alvarez
is that he has the title and that's

1664
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,690
why it's sellable.

1665
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,200
If it was just Conor McGregor
versus Eddie Alvarez,

1666
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,050
they didn't have the title.

1667
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:49,831
You can't sell it.

1668
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:50,300
It's just that.

1669
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,520
Well,

1670
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,040
because it's so good to Miller
garden stuck in the middle.

1671
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,400
So valuable because we realize
how valuable that title,

1672
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,340
because Tony is right
in there in my opinion,

1673
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,840
as his Barboza as as a
couple of Habib number go.

1674
00:47:02,841 --> 00:47:03,990
Madoff is of car course.

1675
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:04,920
Everybody's first choice.

1676
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:05,700
He's undefeated.

1677
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,260
Nobody's been able to
deal with that graph.

1678
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,130
Suplex your face nasty
fucking striker too.

1679
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:10,964
And he going to give him,

1680
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,990
give him a place fighting.

1681
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,900
He's fighting Michael Johnson and the Max.

1682
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:15,360
Right?

1683
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,051
And that car,

1684
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:17,490
that's a fucking great fight.

1685
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:18,211
Johnson,

1686
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:19,560
just coming off of the knockout of poor.

1687
00:47:19,561 --> 00:47:20,130
Yay.

1688
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,150
That's a great fight.

1689
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:21,984
Great fight.

1690
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,490
Sound on the main card.

1691
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,260
Yay.

1692
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,093
It's the best work.

1693
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:25,943
Let's be real.

1694
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,080
We always argue what's
the best UFC fight card.

1695
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,270
That's the best UFC fight card.

1696
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:30,220
The ball diamond

1697
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,610
clothes.

1698
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,380
It's like by far holds up.

1699
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:32,711
Yeah.

1700
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:33,544
If it holds up,

1701
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:34,783
what's the lineup?

1702
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,763
Can I say it?

1703
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,760
The lean and the lineup is fucking insane.

1704
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,750
You have three world title fights.

1705
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,970
You have hours versus Conor Mcgregor.

1706
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,470
You have Tyron Woodley's
fighting Wonderboy.

1707
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,570
People forget that to Steven happening
because everybody's talking about other

1708
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:49,781
fights.

1709
00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:50,680
They forget this fight.

1710
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,700
How about you Andrea and Jay?

1711
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:53,290
Check Versus Carolina K voce.

1712
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,124
Bitch.

1713
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,300
Come on man.

1714
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,820
Nobody's even talking about
that and then you have Chris,

1715
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:00,730
why I met versus Yell
All motherfucking Romero.

1716
00:48:00,731 --> 00:48:01,760
Come on.

1717
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:09,010
Then our boy cowboy counseling this Kelvin
Kelvin and look at this mission first

1718
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,450
is Raquel Pennington got
a fucking fire fights.

1719
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,111
Never met.

1720
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:17,020
Raquel Pennington is one of the
best Bantam weight in the world.

1721
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,910
Nobody talks about her because she's,

1722
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:22,150
she's won some fights in a crazy way
like the Ashley Evan Smith fight.

1723
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,460
She's had some great,

1724
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:24,431
but she looks,

1725
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,800
she took Holly Holm to
fucking split decision I had.

1726
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:28,260
Those girls have lost a lot though.

1727
00:48:28,261 --> 00:48:29,380
He to eight and six.

1728
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,161
They have brawls,

1729
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:30,790
Bro.

1730
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,050
These girls go after it and Pennington my,

1731
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:33,963
in my opinion,

1732
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,991
super,

1733
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:36,010
super aggressive.

1734
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,180
I like watching her fight me.

1735
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,620
She got beat up in the last fight.

1736
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,310
She did.

1737
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:39,800
God.

1738
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,633
Amanda Nunez.

1739
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,741
[inaudible] Nunez.

1740
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:42,010
No jail.

1741
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:42,521
Oh my God.

1742
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:44,180
Frankie Edgar versus Jeremy Stephens.

1743
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,160
I almost forgot about that.

1744
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:49,120
That's insane.

1745
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,460
Neuroma Grumet often Johnson.

1746
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:52,450
Holy Shit.

1747
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:53,470
It's not even close.

1748
00:48:53,471 --> 00:48:55,270
There's not even a second place.

1749
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:57,310
Hallway shots and get kids entity.

1750
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:58,144
Oh my God.

1751
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:59,230
To my favorites.

1752
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,710
Why did they decide to
go gangbusters on this?

1753
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:05,210
Halfway on the towel is fighting.

1754
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,090
Tim Boetsch a fun fight and that's all.

1755
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:07,630
I'm fine.

1756
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,040
We train to New York with Hanzo.

1757
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,623
Jim Miller.

1758
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:11,780
I'll go.

1759
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,700
I was fighting one 55
this comes first Friday.

1760
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,320
I call that the throat throwback Thursday.

1761
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:18,880
Have you seen what Alvarez looks like?

1762
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:19,714
It's crazy.

1763
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,261
I have not.

1764
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:20,800
He's running,

1765
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,780
he's way thinner and he's lighter.

1766
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:23,051
You know,

1767
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:26,050
you remember when Elvis fought Matt
Hughes when he didn't make weight?

1768
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:26,410
Yeah,

1769
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:28,710
and he was a coal reala.

1770
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:34,000
The baby girl is so jacked.

1771
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:35,260
It was hair said.

1772
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:36,094
See Ya.

1773
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,760
He had,

1774
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:39,820
he had muscles that would
start above his ears.

1775
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,130
Pimple.

1776
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:42,701
Excuse me sir.

1777
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:45,190
You're actually turning into a
pit bull when he stopped mad.

1778
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,710
Who's flying a look like?

1779
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,670
He looks like one.

1780
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:48,970
Yeah,

1781
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,200
he was so big.

1782
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,640
He was so powerful.

1783
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,990
One of the best box.

1784
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,920
He was the most feared and
Barboza of like 10 years ago.

1785
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,813
Look at him right there.

1786
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,880
Good for he's big or boat but Barboza man.

1787
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,280
Well he was a big deal.

1788
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,250
Do you remember he fought
Martin [inaudible] was
tooling Martin Kampmann until

1789
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,320
he went for the take down.

1790
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,273
Out of nowhere.

1791
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:09,370
He was winning.

1792
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,293
He had him hurt.

1793
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,530
He had them staggered and someone
told them to go for the takedown.

1794
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:14,280
Yeah,

1795
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,113
and you get your cotton.

1796
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,151
So someone should be,

1797
00:50:16,151 --> 00:50:20,350
first time I seen him fight it was at a
small show at a high school in Chicago.

1798
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,570
Jason Chambers fought to,

1799
00:50:21,571 --> 00:50:22,120
I love it.

1800
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:22,960
Oh that's right.

1801
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:27,190
He's an American top team guy and man,

1802
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,063
he

1803
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,293
from that fight,

1804
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,171
it was pretty,

1805
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:32,510
it was quite clear that he was
going to have a serious career.

1806
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,490
Was he bodied on Holy Shit.

1807
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:35,670
Tacos was always bodied up.

1808
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,021
But not,

1809
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:38,270
well actually when he
spot phots Spencer Fisher,

1810
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:39,021
Spencer Fisher,

1811
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:40,670
people don't remember Spencer,

1812
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:44,960
that King motherfucking Fisher
Triangle Spencer who was a skillful,

1813
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,110
skillful and he caught
Tiago with a triangle.

1814
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,780
But I think Tiago was only
like 20 years old at the time.

1815
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,040
I think he was super,

1816
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:52,874
super young,

1817
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,100
but I think that was Seattle's
first fight in the UFC,

1818
00:50:55,101 --> 00:50:55,934
if I remember right.

1819
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:56,631
It was finding that,

1820
00:50:56,631 --> 00:50:56,761
yeah,

1821
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:58,910
at 19 or 29 he was young,

1822
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,600
real young,

1823
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,410
really young.

1824
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:01,243
But so he's,

1825
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,500
he's looks real light now real thin.

1826
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:04,390
And he did the,

1827
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:05,510
the Cam Haynes thing,

1828
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:06,560
can't you,

1829
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,680
how much you lose when you had to do that
big foot 200 you lost like 20 pounds,

1830
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:09,891
right?

1831
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:10,370
Yeah.

1832
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:10,560
You,

1833
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,360
but you did it.

1834
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,450
He did in the most gangster way
because it had one 80 he was,

1835
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,860
he was not fat.

1836
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,950
So what he had to do was he had
to make his body eat itself.

1837
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,340
You have to burn off 3000 calories
and take in one or taking him to,

1838
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,600
I did four and three,

1839
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,261
four and three.

1840
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:28,000
So there you go.

1841
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,210
You,

1842
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,660
you burn that off that way.

1843
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,770
So how'd you do it?

1844
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,450
You body eats itself running just
running nonstop 20 miles a day.

1845
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,960
They supplies the VSP,

1846
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,750
hit the twist tree.

1847
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,840
This is a good crazy ass fight and Jimmy
man was a nasty strike or someone's

1848
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,450
getting knocked down.

1849
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:45,680
So inside leg kick someone's
getting knocked out and
Manoa has been in camp with

1850
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:46,460
Gustafson.

1851
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,220
Who he fought actually
Gustafson stopped him.

1852
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:50,270
Yeah,

1853
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,860
but man was really good.

1854
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:52,310
He's just,

1855
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,170
he hasn't been fighting for that long.

1856
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:55,040
It's really interesting.

1857
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,160
He didn't start martial arts I
think til he was like 28 years old.

1858
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,670
Yeah,

1859
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,980
he was in I to say prison
for a while in England.

1860
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,390
How dare you just make that up.

1861
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:03,030
You didn't even know.

1862
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,640
It's like tower seven all over again.

1863
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:10,550
I'm almost positive he did some time
needs to get on the social media thing

1864
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:11,900
cause he liked your picture today.

1865
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:12,711
So I was like,

1866
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:12,921
Hey,

1867
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,730
is this him?

1868
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:14,250
And I went to,

1869
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:15,620
it's like 600 followers.

1870
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,090
Maybe might not be him.

1871
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,450
It might not be him.

1872
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,150
I'm like 600 followers.

1873
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:21,580
That is fake.

1874
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:21,910
No,

1875
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:22,430
he's got more.

1876
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,950
He's a superstar in Sweden.

1877
00:52:24,951 --> 00:52:25,180
Yeah.

1878
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,120
It doesn't make any sense.

1879
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,340
No,

1880
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:27,500
no.

1881
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,333
He's,

1882
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,840
when he fought in Stockholm,

1883
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,880
when he fought a rumble rumble Johnson,

1884
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,970
there's a giant crowd there.

1885
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:34,251
I mean,

1886
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,370
I want to say like 30,000 plus
people that he has billboards.

1887
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,273
Oh Gosh.

1888
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:38,760
Yeah.

1889
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,593
He's a stud,

1890
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,390
so there's no way that was a real wow.

1891
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:42,500
It was a good fight.

1892
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,470
But Jimmy Manoa has like really nasty,

1893
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:48,290
nasty power and stand up for mechanics.

1894
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:48,860
Yeah.

1895
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,220
Like I find it almost hard to believe he
did it and start striking until he was

1896
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:53,090
28 years old.

1897
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:53,780
Good athlete.

1898
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,250
Yeah.

1899
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,110
OSP is a better athlete
and he's so hard to,

1900
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,610
he's like so unconventional.

1901
00:52:58,611 --> 00:52:59,860
That's why I had to give us,

1902
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:01,910
yeah,

1903
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:02,690
that hurt.

1904
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,350
We have to also remember that Osp suffered
a broken arm and the John Jones fight

1905
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,620
and you don't know how long
it took for that to heal up,

1906
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:10,670
how it healed up.

1907
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,530
Some guys will break an arm,

1908
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,460
like a bad examples like the Nogueira
fight when Frank Mir broke Nogueira his

1909
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:20,180
arm Nogueira's arm was pretty
fucked up for a long time.

1910
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:20,631
After that.

1911
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:24,110
I was also 80 years old in the fight
world when he broke his fucking dog in the

1912
00:53:24,111 --> 00:53:24,670
fight.

1913
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,610
He was 80 years a tortoise

1914
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,493
flight years.

1915
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,510
It was up here.

1916
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,870
It was the upper is a mess.

1917
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,850
Snap to shit off of God.

1918
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,340
That was ugly man.

1919
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:36,390
We just caught him with a knee.

1920
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,291
Yeah,

1921
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:38,040
he's um,

1922
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,550
he,

1923
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,520
Frank Mir is a fucking
bad ass submission artist.

1924
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:43,770
This OSP holding onto the head.

1925
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,850
This ain't good from
Manoa was like a neat,

1926
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,300
oh look at that and I
just drops right down.

1927
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,153
You know,

1928
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,710
he was a beautiful going to twist him.

1929
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:54,090
Watch beautiful wrestling.

1930
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,890
Mental is not exactly a grappler.

1931
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:56,071
Yeah.

1932
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:57,270
This is smart by Ospi,

1933
00:53:57,271 --> 00:53:58,104
man.

1934
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,420
Don't be shocked if it
gets into the truck.

1935
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,000
Don't be shocked if it
gets into what you'll see.

1936
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,730
I'll tell you what Osp,

1937
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,710
when he fought John Jones,

1938
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:09,600
he might've lost that fight,

1939
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:13,760
but he showed people that he's a real
world class fighter and the fact that he

1940
00:54:13,761 --> 00:54:17,040
was able to fight with a
broken arm through a portion,

1941
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:19,140
I think of the fourth and
the whole fifth round.

1942
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,341
Yeah.

1943
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:20,611
I think,

1944
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,444
I think you've got to,

1945
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:21,931
you know,

1946
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:22,920
even though he lost the fight,

1947
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:24,600
he got a shitload of confidence from him.

1948
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,980
So that helps.

1949
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,750
John also was kind of weird,

1950
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:27,961
you know,

1951
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:29,010
it was a little weird night.

1952
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:29,880
He broke his arm.

1953
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:30,830
John was super,

1954
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:31,690
you know,

1955
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,090
and I think that see people,

1956
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:34,380
I think given John a hard time,

1957
00:54:34,381 --> 00:54:36,180
I think John didn't feel that comfortable,

1958
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:38,970
but I think that osps really fucking good.

1959
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:40,650
And I think the giant had to be careful.

1960
00:54:40,651 --> 00:54:40,981
I agree.

1961
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:44,100
I think John had to be careful and I
think John played it a little safe.

1962
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:46,350
And I think Osp as a south dropped,

1963
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:52,020
he dropped out for the kids who are
looking for the kids in our men.

1964
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,660
He's not going to just
hold it on right now.

1965
00:54:54,661 --> 00:54:54,870
Hey,

1966
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,620
he might get it.

1967
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,131
It's totally,

1968
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:57,060
totally my get it.

1969
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,950
You never know what's going on.

1970
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,570
What's going on the right arm,

1971
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:01,890
what's going on with it
was piece of right arm.

1972
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,210
He's definitely under the chin,

1973
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:03,450
right?

1974
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:04,590
I just pushing down the rest.

1975
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:05,880
Uh,

1976
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,440
he's got some hand fight,

1977
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,303
some space.

1978
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:09,953
Oh Shit.

1979
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,300
The back scrambles,

1980
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,720
little tiny scrambles
like that into the truck.

1981
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,700
Hasn't got,

1982
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,440
he's even got a brand on this
Kennedy's he might have one.

1983
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:23,910
Yeah.

1984
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,940
At this fraternity to see Tennessee,

1985
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,120
one minute see manner where there
was like some little space there.

1986
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,480
There was some space to scramble and man,

1987
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:32,961
Ooh,

1988
00:55:32,961 --> 00:55:33,571
the rest of it.

1989
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:36,100
Instead of scrambling at 49 seconds.

1990
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:36,871
Exactly.

1991
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:39,750
He arrested instead of square and it
wasn't a perfect spot against the fence.

1992
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:40,950
He's turning to his left,

1993
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:41,701
which is perfect.

1994
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:42,511
If he turned to his ride,

1995
00:55:42,511 --> 00:55:44,250
he'd be in deep trouble.

1996
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:48,570
Bravo's where fucking elbows to the
back of the head would be the king.

1997
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:49,861
To your point,

1998
00:55:49,861 --> 00:55:50,011
Joe,

1999
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:50,850
when you said he rested,

2000
00:55:50,851 --> 00:55:51,690
we should have scrambled.

2001
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:53,040
That's where the world champions don't,

2002
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,840
they literally get the fuck out
and change the danger of the game.

2003
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,930
Like you look at,

2004
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,780
you know like a guy like mighty
mouse is a perfect example.

2005
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,620
I know I always use them,

2006
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:03,120
but they ain't getting no room there

2007
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:05,783
and she's,

2008
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,510
Oh,

2009
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,490
let's go into it.

2010
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,343
I lost it.

2011
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,150
That would have been
dope if you rolled there,

2012
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,290
but he was up against the cage.

2013
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,010
That's a weird,

2014
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:14,910
weird place to roll,

2015
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:15,240
right?

2016
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,940
Yeah.

2017
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,470
Yeah.

2018
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,060
I was not a good place to set it up.

2019
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,090
Oh Man.

2020
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,080
That's a nice elbow.

2021
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,943
Yeah.

2022
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,483
Wow.

2023
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,580
So how many people are
going to be at the uh,

2024
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,170
New York show?

2025
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:32,940
I don't know how many people was
Madison Square Garden seat tickets are

2026
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:34,243
expensive.

2027
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,670
Insanely expensive already.

2028
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,031
Yeah,

2029
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:37,251
they,

2030
00:56:37,251 --> 00:56:38,170
they went for it.

2031
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,090
I mean it's square garden.

2032
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:40,820
First time ever.

2033
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:41,653
UFC

2034
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,050
think how many people would have
to get paid for that show too.

2035
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:50,050
There's a lot of whirl
yas fighters on that show.

2036
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:50,950
That is,

2037
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:54,250
that is the God damn paper
view bargain of a lifetime.

2038
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,473
That card,

2039
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,140
it's the paper.

2040
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,190
If you bargain of a lifetime,

2041
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,000
you have a kid.

2042
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,310
And then the thing about
the free flights on Fox,

2043
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,140
those prelims are nuts.

2044
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,483
Dude.

2045
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,100
Nigga man Hoff versus
Michael Johnson is on Fox.

2046
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,950
So it's Frankie Edgar
versus Jeremy Stevens.

2047
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:09,311
That's great.

2048
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:10,270
That's on fs one.

2049
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:10,870
Yeah.

2050
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,220
Holy Shit.

2051
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:13,060
Like to,

2052
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,410
I'd like to see Stevens when that,

2053
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,303
I like him.

2054
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,540
I love Frankie too.

2055
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:17,800
I love them.

2056
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,880
I love Jeremy Too.

2057
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:19,511
That's a,

2058
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:21,030
that's one for me is a problem there.

2059
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,650
Little Frank.

2060
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,151
Great Guy.

2061
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:23,130
I love Jeremy.

2062
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:24,580
Jeremy's a fucking great guy.

2063
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:26,200
He's an animal too.

2064
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:27,300
I love watch that kid.

2065
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,650
He's so game too.

2066
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:30,311
He's another one.

2067
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:30,660
It's sows.

2068
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,490
Frankie.

2069
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,190
Frankie's just relentless.

2070
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:34,421
Yeah.

2071
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,550
Best Pace on the game.

2072
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,290
I'm interested in see what adjustments
Frankie makes from the Aldo fight now

2073
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,220
cause I'll go beat up a little bit.

2074
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:42,641
Yeah,

2075
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,730
I'll do a flip the script on them
and you turn it into a boxing match.

2076
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:47,550
Although flip the script on the UFC.

2077
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:47,741
He said,

2078
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:47,921
Nah,

2079
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:48,251
I'm good.

2080
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:48,611
I'm good.

2081
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,350
I'm done.

2082
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,183
Is he serious?

2083
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,920
What is he saying?

2084
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,210
He said he's going to play soccer.

2085
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:57,340
I don't know what he wants to play
some serious serious kicks here,

2086
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:57,970
man.

2087
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,050
Beautiful leg kicks.

2088
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,770
LSPS attack at the end
say oh the left hook.

2089
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,970
Do you think all those being serious
or do you think he's just expressing oh

2090
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:07,331
nice.

2091
00:58:07,331 --> 00:58:08,320
Walked right into that.

2092
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,450
I think he's being serious for now to
realize is what kind of monster he's

2093
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:12,851
dealing with.

2094
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:14,920
Because even though you don't like it,

2095
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,990
they're never gonna let
you out of your contract.

2096
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:17,351
It's,

2097
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:18,280
it doesn't work that way.

2098
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:19,210
He signed the contract.

2099
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:22,480
Like unless you're literally legitimately
going to go play another sport.

2100
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:22,910
Yeah,

2101
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,741
you're done fighting.

2102
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:27,160
If you're not going to write out your
UFC contract doesn't work like that.

2103
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:27,531
Well,

2104
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:29,290
I don't think he's asking to fight again.

2105
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,420
I think he's saying that he's
going to do something else.

2106
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,040
I think that's essentially
what he's saying.

2107
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,280
What I read,

2108
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,490
Oh,

2109
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:35,770
we got spinning back for as a temp.

2110
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,570
What I read is that who's
going to play soccer?

2111
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:39,183
That's him.

2112
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,710
He apparently before he fought in the UFC,

2113
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:42,101
look dude,

2114
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,270
he's fucking good.

2115
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,381
I mean,

2116
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:46,150
I don't know like how he is mean.

2117
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,400
I'm sure he's playing other
good soccer charity game.

2118
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:49,420
If we're Natto came in there,

2119
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:50,540
he'd fucking kick is

2120
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:58,380
or that guy.

2121
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,213
Messi.

2122
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,673
I see

2123
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:02,981
five,

2124
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:03,580
four,

2125
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:03,941
dude.

2126
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,970
He's amazing scores.

2127
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,390
Four goals a game.

2128
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:08,860
See some highlights of that dude.

2129
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:09,071
I'm like,

2130
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:09,950
he's incredible.

2131
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,820
His role of his man of the ball.

2132
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,470
These guys are going off.

2133
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,453
Yeah.

2134
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:16,721
It's good.

2135
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:17,770
Kicking in this fight.

2136
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,130
O s p without long.

2137
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:22,703
Oh,

2138
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:24,763
oh.

2139
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,050
Oh,

2140
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:26,240
I see.

2141
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,073
He's dropping.

2142
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:27,890
You feel?

2143
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:28,221
Yeah.

2144
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:29,540
I'll just cover this real quick.

2145
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:29,841
Yeah,

2146
00:59:29,841 --> 00:59:30,950
he's dropping that right arm,

2147
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:31,480
man.

2148
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,530
It tough as fun to fuck your cardio up.

2149
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:33,801
Nice.

2150
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:37,520
Inside the capital to
open up that left ear too.

2151
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,121
Oh,

2152
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:38,630
right there.

2153
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,751
Yeah.

2154
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:40,730
He changed positions for a while.

2155
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:41,630
He went south Paul,

2156
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,220
which he does do sometimes,

2157
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:44,150
so you know how we would stop,

2158
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:46,633
dude.

2159
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:48,800
He looks tired of Shit too.

2160
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:50,990
You know how you always talking about
how are we talking about you need super

2161
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:52,520
camps this day and age to compete.

2162
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,080
Yes.

2163
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,400
Piece of guy that doesn't
train a super camp.

2164
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,620
Steve Bay's guy that doesn't
train the super camp.

2165
00:59:57,621 --> 01:00:02,621
What's think about Super Camp Like
I Att Aka Jack Black's aliens.

2166
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,511
Yeah.

2167
01:00:05,511 --> 01:00:06,021
It's interesting,

2168
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:06,350
right?

2169
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:07,130
Right.

2170
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:07,311
Well,

2171
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:09,620
strong style that Jim in Cleveland.

2172
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,850
Oh my God.

2173
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,180
Straight K.

2174
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:18,280
Oh God.

2175
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,470
Did you see his leg caught on?

2176
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,650
Oh my God.

2177
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,730
Oh my God.

2178
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,680
And then the right,

2179
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,680
they'll fucking Jimmy man was dangerous.

2180
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,360
How hurt English left Hook.

2181
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,190
He paired them with those
left hooks the body,

2182
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,920
and they caught him upstairs.

2183
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,550
The huge wind based one in his crib.

2184
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:35,963
Giant.

2185
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:36,651
Giant went.

2186
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:40,580
Especially considering how good Osp looks
against Jon Jones went five rounds at

2187
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:42,650
Jones Chimi stops when the second round.

2188
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:43,940
God giant.

2189
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:45,710
Who's the last guy to beat this guy?

2190
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:46,730
Um,

2191
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,080
rumbled,

2192
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:47,913

2194
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:57,590
Jesus slept till your hair at hand.

2195
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:58,160
Right here.

2196
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:58,641
He's looking at us.

2197
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:00,170
Look how patient he is right here.

2198
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,640
Boom.

2199
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:02,781
Hey Raph,

2200
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:03,614
let's go.

2201
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:04,380
Yeah,

2202
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,800
I mean that's a,

2203
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,160
that's look at this.

2204
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:07,920
Boom.

2205
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,690
Full body shy hand high two ducks.

2206
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,470
The left hand.

2207
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,290
Look at that beautiful
right hand over the top

2208
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,590
to look at the setup.

2209
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:20,570
The setup is nice ms patients.

2210
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:21,651
Boom.

2211
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:22,190
Perfect.

2212
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,150
Oh God,

2213
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:26,350
that it's real bad the way they got there.

2214
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,770
Reminds me of a Mike Tyson.

2215
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,371
Larry Holmes.

2216
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:28,731
Remember that?

2217
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:30,070
Knock out bad.

2218
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,030
Mike Thompson knocked out Larry Holmes.

2219
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,470
Larry Holmes leg got caught
under him and sprang up and down.

2220
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,460
No one's worse than Cro.

2221
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,120
Cop,

2222
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,691
Gonzaga.

2223
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:39,170
Like we were like,

2224
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:39,561
oh shit.

2225
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:40,520
He broke his ankle.

2226
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,030
Yeah,

2227
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,811
I think he really did.

2228
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:42,950
Fuck it's ankle of his ankles.

2229
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:44,390
Swole up and it swelled up when we,

2230
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,631
well,

2231
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:45,740
I think when you talk to him,

2232
01:01:45,741 --> 01:01:45,921
he's like,

2233
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:46,041
no,

2234
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:47,630
my ankle feels like I'm good man.

2235
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:48,530
Like you walked out.

2236
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:50,420
I thought his shit snapped off.

2237
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:53,930
He was the first guy where I realize we
shouldn't be interviewing fighters after

2238
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:56,060
they fight legit knocked out.

2239
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:56,481
I was like,

2240
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:57,380
you can't be doing the same.

2241
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:57,681
Yeah,

2242
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:57,970
like that.

2243
01:01:57,970 --> 01:01:58,970
He doesn't know what he's doing.

2244
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,860
He doesn't even know where you are.

2245
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:03,320
You don't know what happened and
then they put a mic in your face.

2246
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:03,680
You're like,

2247
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,460
ah,

2248
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,770
it's totally assuming I got
punched or kicked in the face.

2249
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,640
It'd be one thing if the fight or felt
fine and was willing to talk about it and

2250
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:12,680
new and wanting to do it themselves,

2251
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:13,641
but even then,

2252
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:14,450
then they shouldn't.

2253
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:14,931
Even then,

2254
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,580
it's probably not the best idea.

2255
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:16,760
No,

2256
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:17,593
cause I've done that,

2257
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,440
but my manager's like,

2258
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:18,581
dude,

2259
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:19,411
you shouldn't do this interview.

2260
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:20,800
And I did it really back.

2261
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,673
Stay this.

2262
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:23,910
Watch this.

2263
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,260
Watch when Larry Holmes gets up,

2264
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,210
Larry Holmes was in all sorts of trouble,

2265
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:28,410
but watch the K out.

2266
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:29,970
They give him the standing eight count.

2267
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:30,910
Larry's walking around.

2268
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,310
He's already in deep doodoo though.

2269
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,120
I mean,

2270
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,740
Larry's a legitimate,

2271
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:35,220
you know,

2272
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,840
36 or whatever he was at the time.

2273
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:37,733
Watch this chaos.

2274
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,790
It's so nasty.

2275
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,520
He gets some over in
the right hand corner.

2276
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:44,820
Super wobbly legs.

2277
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,950
Pull that left hook right hand.

2278
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,360
Here comes right here,

2279
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:49,563
dude.

2280
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:50,820
Oh my goodness.

2281
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,471
Oh my God.

2282
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:53,450
You got hurt there.

2283
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,111
Oh my God.

2284
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:56,820
I forgot how my long this lasted.

2285
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,520
He Tyson Tyson off.

2286
01:02:58,521 --> 01:02:58,790
Yeah,

2287
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,660
he was stressed right now.

2288
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,081
Yeah,

2289
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:01,560
he looks strange.

2290
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:05,190
Little basketball back then
he was switched dances.

2291
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,540
No defense at all.

2292
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:07,441
Well,

2293
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,270
he just was aware that Larry was done.

2294
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,133
Yeah,

2295
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:13,010
I tried to catch him.

2296
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:16,500
Oh,

2297
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,131
this is it.

2298
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:17,964
This is the right hand.

2299
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,290
Didn't stop it.

2300
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:19,891
Boom.

2301
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:20,724
Right there.

2302
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:21,750
See his leg?

2303
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,350
His leg went under over and then
bounced up like a cheerleader kicked.

2304
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,780
I know what the most brutal knockout ever.

2305
01:03:27,781 --> 01:03:28,710
Ray Mercer.

2306
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:29,600
Tommy Morris.

2307
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:29,851
Oh,

2308
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:30,684
you're right,

2309
01:03:30,730 --> 01:03:31,140
ray.

2310
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,250
He got caught on the ropes.

2311
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:34,230
So Ray Mercer kept upper cutting him.

2312
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,193
He,

2313
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:38,460
the ropes were holding
his ass up that legs bad.

2314
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:41,010
Do you see that Joe was
bad and he had aids?

2315
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:42,120
Correct?

2316
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,590
I don't think he had aids back down.

2317
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,340
Did he was bought,

2318
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,590
you want to talk about one of the
best white boy bodies of all time?

2319
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,820
Tommy Morrison.

2320
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,000
What happened later on in his
career when he went crazy,

2321
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:52,020
he got his tits done.

2322
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:52,171
Well,

2323
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:53,004
he got aids.

2324
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:53,520
Yeah,

2325
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:53,820
he had,

2326
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,930
he had breast implants.

2327
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:55,920
Is fights and chronic.

2328
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,310
Just show the human hurry.

2329
01:03:58,320 --> 01:03:58,710
Go.

2330
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,320
So in the beginning Tommy was doing well,

2331
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,380
but then ray Mercer came on strong.

2332
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:05,280
Here it is in the fifth round.

2333
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:05,581
Look at this.

2334
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:06,240
Boom,

2335
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:06,631
boom,

2336
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:06,961
boom,

2337
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:07,620
boom.

2338
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,331
Oh my God.

2339
01:04:08,331 --> 01:04:08,670
Why?

2340
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,590
Oh see him tied up

2341
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,990
like three boom.

2342
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:20,040
Oh Oh balance go route.

2343
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:22,830
That's insane.

2344
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:23,910
That is insane.

2345
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,581
That's insane.

2346
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:27,540
You know Ray Mercer Kimbo slice.

2347
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,403
I got to take a pee.

2348
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:29,011
Yeah,

2349
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:29,430
buddy.

2350
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:30,263
Guillotine dumb.

2351
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:30,791
Yeah,

2352
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,600
it Kimbo and Ray wrote down,

2353
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,590
but ray ray didn't have any
grappling experience at all.

2354
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:40,170
And Kimbo was training
at American top team.

2355
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,090
Even though Kimbo is not a grappler,

2356
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,330
he was more of a grappler than ray ray
probably thought it was just going to be

2357
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:46,470
like a stand up fight.

2358
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:46,801
This,

2359
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:47,581
it can be big.

2360
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,170
We get this times square.

2361
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,590
I know.

2362
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,640
Come on saying,

2363
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:51,600
look at this.

2364
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,530
Conor is Conor,

2365
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,860
he's like gangster,

2366
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:56,280
like she's got Cammo on.

2367
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:57,173
Oh,

2368
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,400
this is pretty Tyron Woodley.

2369
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:00,990
Eddie Alvarez drinking a cup of coffee.

2370
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,583
I don't get it.

2371
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,470
Other one is at the airport.

2372
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:05,460
Yeah,

2373
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,020
Wonderboy motherfucker.

2374
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:08,280
Oh man,

2375
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,530
you'll wanna.

2376
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,610
I can't even hear this.

2377
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:12,780
And it looks cool,

2378
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,740
dude.

2379
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:14,730
There's Carlina Cabal,

2380
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,361
Tyron,

2381
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:16,290
motherfucking Woodley,

2382
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:16,951
ladies and gentlemen.

2383
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:18,010
I think a bad ass right there.

2384
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,600
It is a fucking bad ass.

2385
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:21,670
He's got some power too.

2386
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:23,050
That's putting it mildly.

2387
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,400
Nobody knocks out Robbie Lawler.

2388
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:28,103
Tyron can,

2389
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,040
he can cover some distance to,

2390
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:30,400
yeah,

2391
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,210
he put the lights out and he's
a Duke grooveless a protege.

2392
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:39,510
Duke Roufus is one of the best striking
coach on the planet earth before World

2393
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,350
Moy Thai champion.

2394
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:45,820
His brother Rick Rufus is another
kickboxing legend like that family.

2395
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:46,750
There's some deep,

2396
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,260
deep,

2397
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,190
deep knowledge.

2398
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,420
And that's what tyrants training.

2399
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:50,710
That's where he's doing all his striking.

2400
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:54,780
So Wonderboy is probably
without w mean it's,

2401
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,180
it's a debate that he's the
greatest striker in the UFC.

2402
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,710
Ever wonder boy.

2403
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,100
Yeah,

2404
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,980
it's a debate because he
was some insane number,

2405
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:05,170
like 57 and oh and kickbox.

2406
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:05,830
Yeah,

2407
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:07,480
he only lost one time in the UFC.

2408
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:08,470
That was to Matt Brown.

2409
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,090
He just looks like a normal guy.

2410
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,860
Does an intellect when they're
showing them right there.

2411
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:12,610
Yeah.

2412
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:14,230
And in a very polite guy to really,

2413
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:14,800
well,

2414
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,633
well spoken,

2415
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:18,490
but his kickboxing is off the chain.

2416
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,620
I mean he's a world champion.

2417
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:22,090
Kickboxer of the likes are.

2418
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:25,780
There's very few guys who
fought in MMA like you know,

2419
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,180
even Mirko Mirko was a k one Stryker
and who's a bad motherfucker.

2420
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:33,820
But one of the reasons why he was so
good in MMA was cause he was explosive.

2421
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,360
He was really fast and he could
hit really hard and quick,

2422
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:42,570
but he wasn't like the most like s
technically perfect kickboxer like Ernesto

2423
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:44,380
hoost.

2424
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:44,981
But Ernesto,

2425
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:45,640
who's,

2426
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,790
he would pick you apart nice and slow,

2427
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:51,460
do it all with technique and just chop
chop away at you and eventually knock you

2428
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:54,790
out with some beautiful high kick or a
perfectly placed punch or something like

2429
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:55,210
that.

2430
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:00,190
But Merkel wouldn't bark guys with like
one kick and those type of guys are like

2431
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:04,150
at a high level like Mirko was there more
dangerous and MMA because haven't met

2432
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:05,410
everything happens so fast.

2433
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:06,850
You're saying wonder boys like that?

2434
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,370
I think Wonderboy is super skillful.

2435
01:07:09,550 --> 01:07:12,490
He skillful in a way like when you see
him fight Hendricks you realize like,

2436
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,540
oh my God,

2437
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:17,380
like this is so next level and he
does stuff that everybody can't do.

2438
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:18,970
Like right off the front leg,

2439
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,470
his front leg,

2440
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:24,090
you got to get past that front leg
and that's not an easy thing to do.

2441
01:07:24,091 --> 01:07:25,100
He's front leg side.

2442
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:27,760
Cal is a salad that round Kenyan his face,

2443
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:29,650
he could do some shit
that other guys can't do.

2444
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,610
So like you,

2445
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:30,920
you,

2446
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,240
you have a real hard time bringing in
someone and training that has a front leg.

2447
01:07:34,241 --> 01:07:34,891
Like that guy.

2448
01:07:34,891 --> 01:07:35,140
Yeah.

2449
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:36,760
You only have like a
few guys to choose from.

2450
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,590
You have to take like Raymond Daniels,

2451
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,870
you have to take someone
who does Dragon Wilson.

2452
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:41,420
Ah,

2453
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:42,370
Don could've done it.

2454
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,120
Thrive.

2455
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:43,953
I mean if you could still,

2456
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:46,780
it was like then he was just on
one leg just like flipping it up.

2457
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,200
You know when Donna dragging roles,

2458
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,870
Wilson might still be able to spar.

2459
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,510
He's one of them that keeps
training in and dipping.

2460
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,170
It was like sixties and seventies
if you light spar with them,

2461
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:56,820
as long as you tried to,

2462
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,880
don't try to beat him up.

2463
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,300
He's a skillful motherfucker.

2464
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,630
Tez Ronda Rousey really
fighting a man in Nunez.

2465
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:02,920
Is that real or was that a hoax?

2466
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,690
I think that's what she wants to do,

2467
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,070
but I don't think it's been set up.

2468
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:06,760
I heard she,

2469
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:10,450
I thought she wants to fight Cyborg
and cyborgs said she's going eat face

2470
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:10,850
surgery.

2471
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:11,470
She fights it.

2472
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,400
Do you know what Cyborg said?

2473
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:12,790
She said,

2474
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,950
I'm like candy man to say my
name and how come she thought,

2475
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:16,820
but she scares me.

2476
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,040
I going to be Cyborg.

2477
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:21,920
Cyborg is called calling around today.

2478
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,470
Yeah,

2479
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,630
man wants to fight her so bad.

2480
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:24,081
And then she said,

2481
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,220
maybe if I was blue eyes,

2482
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:25,971
blonde hair,

2483
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:27,140
and you'd make a division for me,

2484
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,220
give me the goddamn fight.

2485
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,113
Oh my God.

2486
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:31,880
Oh my God,

2487
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,010
such a monster.

2488
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,521
And you know what,

2489
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:34,701
man?

2490
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:35,241
Here's the deal.

2491
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:39,020
There's a lot of other women out there
that fight at one 45 this idea that

2492
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:41,180
there's no women at one
45 that's just not true.

2493
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,790
There's women at one 45 they
just don't want to fight.

2494
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:44,631
Nobody will.

2495
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:46,710
Some might hurt some dude that like,

2496
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,170
you know that money,

2497
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,790
Lina Landsberg would just fodder.

2498
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,690
She took the chance.

2499
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:51,420
She fought her.

2500
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,253
She's not,

2501
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:53,900
she's not.

2502
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,860
She didn't land one punch.

2503
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:55,694
He had to know.

2504
01:08:55,700 --> 01:08:56,181
She didn't know.

2505
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,290
She had no chance.

2506
01:08:57,470 --> 01:08:59,810
She took him for the
world more Thai champion.

2507
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,010
She didn't take it for the payday,

2508
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:02,360
the girl's world book,

2509
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:03,980
anything but not really.

2510
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:04,941
She made something.

2511
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:08,870
She got into the UFC and know now she's
in the mix and she can have a career in

2512
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:11,450
the UFC at one 35 she
did not take a chance,

2513
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,290
but if she won,

2514
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,300
it's a giant chance and if you win,

2515
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,710
you're a fucking superhero.

2516
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:21,100
There's no one right now that
would give her an issue in the UFC.

2517
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:22,341
I mean,

2518
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:26,810
here's my ask to ask Holly with her
fighting style would fight her at one 30

2519
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:28,580
here's another example,

2520
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,580
Joanna Barsh.

2521
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:34,010
If Dorina bars has been training MMA
and she decided to come over to MMA,

2522
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,250
you want to talk about a nasty kickboxer?

2523
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:37,791
There's,

2524
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,650
I mean she's got some insane record.

2525
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:41,250
I think she's like 38 Oh shit.

2526
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,780
No one wanted to fight her for years.

2527
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,260
She beat the shit out of her.

2528
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:45,890
Yeah,

2529
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:46,723
I,

2530
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:47,770
she's gangster.

2531
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:48,250
She's at,

2532
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,110
she's tall decision.

2533
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:52,220
She went by decision but then
remember knocked her down.

2534
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:55,100
She talking about doing MMA.

2535
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:55,971
If she did,

2536
01:09:55,971 --> 01:10:00,971
I'm saying that's the kind of seven need
to challenge that takes her down so she

2537
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:02,310
can't keep her off her.

2538
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,200
She might,

2539
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,001
she has a lot.

2540
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,600
That's the other thing
people forget about Cyborg.

2541
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,580
Just she's a black belt on the ground,

2542
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:08,840
legit black,

2543
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,820
worried about that.

2544
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:11,400
You know what I'm saying?

2545
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,860
Now go to the ground with her.

2546
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,020
Totally true if she can take her down,

2547
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:19,430
but in MMA you also have to realize that
bars is fighting with smaller gloves.

2548
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,300
She can,

2549
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,200
she can land shots that are likely
going to have more impact with a smaller

2550
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:24,471
gloves.

2551
01:10:24,471 --> 01:10:27,020
You can also break your hand easier
and she could get taken down.

2552
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:27,500
She's,

2553
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,520
she's a bad app site.

2554
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:28,970
The same way.

2555
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,490
Did you see this fire TV?

2556
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,500
The bars is no fucking joke.

2557
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:34,280
Look at that knee.

2558
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:34,941
I got to step in.

2559
01:10:34,941 --> 01:10:35,541
Neat Dude.

2560
01:10:35,541 --> 01:10:38,720
She's no joke whether there's
a front kick to the face.

2561
01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:41,270
I chose Cyborg swarms or you know,

2562
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,630
cyber.

2563
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:43,090
She's all she can handle.

2564
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,370
Yeah.

2565
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,520
She didn't make it easy and also
remember Cyborg and look at that.

2566
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:47,170
I see.

2567
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:47,691
I see this.

2568
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:48,471
I go Jesus Christ.

2569
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:49,680
Cyborg has a chin too.

2570
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,310
Damn crazy.

2571
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:53,144
Show game.

2572
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,080
See if you Jamie,

2573
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:56,600
see if he could see the front
kick to the face that she landed.

2574
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,980
She landed like a teabag kick to the
face early in the fight and dropped her.

2575
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,250
I don't know what you do with,

2576
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,440
so I don't know who's going to find,

2577
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:04,274
I don't know.

2578
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,720
It's going to step up and fight her.

2579
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:06,410
Here's the thing.

2580
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,760
Nobody wanted to fight bars.

2581
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,250
She's not even a kickboxer.

2582
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:12,830
She's an MMA fighter and she
chose to fight her in her sport.

2583
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:13,980
That's how game she is,

2584
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,420
but she still made it to decision.

2585
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,960
How big would that fiby her
and Rhonda Cyborg and race?

2586
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:22,590
It'd be the biggest fight like crazy
because they could make that happen.

2587
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:23,880
I heard,

2588
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,800
I read the Rhonda is training hard?

2589
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:26,550
Is that true?

2590
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:27,480
That's what I heard too.

2591
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:28,343
I don't know.

2592
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:29,460
I don't know.

2593
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:29,851
I don't know.

2594
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:33,750
I mean the only way to know is to talk
to someone who is training with her and

2595
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:34,620
then you have to trust them.

2596
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,040
Yeah.

2597
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,090
You have to go watch her train.

2598
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:36,660
Right.

2599
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,020
You know?

2600
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,740
I don't know.

2601
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:38,180
God.

2602
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:40,350
I'd love to see her come
back at the top of her game.

2603
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:40,860
Yeah.

2604
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,510
You know what was such a draw?

2605
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:45,000
Amanda Nunez is fucking terrifying.

2606
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,750
Yeah.

2607
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,060
She's got ridiculous power in her hands.

2608
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,330
She,

2609
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,240
she punches with snapping Chris Punches,

2610
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,160
but you could see like
we should take was like,

2611
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,120
oh shit out.

2612
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:54,870
Yeah.

2613
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,590
What?

2614
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:56,610
She landed one and me.

2615
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:57,444
She was like,

2616
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,133
I'm not good.

2617
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:00,030
Look at that knee.

2618
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:00,580
Boom.

2619
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:02,070
That beautiful step in knee.

2620
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,073
Look at that man.

2621
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,861
No Damn.

2622
01:12:04,861 --> 01:12:07,230
She's nasty bars is no joke,

2623
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:07,830
dude.

2624
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,770
It was the land landed the right hand.

2625
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:13,230
It was a scrap boom.

2626
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:15,840
So imagine that punch with
light with small gloves.

2627
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,171
Oh yeah,

2628
01:12:16,171 --> 01:12:16,470
for sure.

2629
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:16,771
Look at that.

2630
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:17,371
Superman Punch.

2631
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:18,990
Cyborg landed Cyborg.

2632
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:20,010
So gangster dude,

2633
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,150
she's so goddamn tough.

2634
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:23,390
I just,

2635
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,930
I just don't see anyone being there.

2636
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,130
I think Dan,

2637
01:12:26,131 --> 01:12:27,240
what a crazy fight that was.

2638
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,550
I think if she's landing
those with four ounce gloves,

2639
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:30,593
who knows?

2640
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,643
Who knows?

2641
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,750
But if bars lands with four ounce gloves,

2642
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:34,710
this is the same thing.

2643
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,480
She was hurting her there with shots too,

2644
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,100
but it was a knees that was hurting her.

2645
01:12:38,101 --> 01:12:38,551
It was all,

2646
01:12:38,551 --> 01:12:39,570
mostly it was everything.

2647
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,390
She hit her with a lot of heart jabs too.

2648
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:42,041
All right,

2649
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:45,330
let's see what he totally Jodi
Goodwin say they reinflated them.

2650
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,150
Ah,

2651
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,550
well he didn't look that bad.

2652
01:12:47,551 --> 01:12:48,330
Right?

2653
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,920
The best he's looked since
the has got extra around that.

2654
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,320
That's the golden stitch came in.

2655
01:12:52,321 --> 01:12:53,154
You're bullied and debates.

2656
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,590
She called finance the golden snitch.

2657
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:57,780
He,

2658
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:59,460
there's no traps like the old veep.

2659
01:12:59,461 --> 01:12:59,820
No,

2660
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:00,301
it's not.

2661
01:13:00,301 --> 01:13:01,170
But you know what?

2662
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:03,870
The old Vituro fought at a bunch
of different weight classes.

2663
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:05,100
Um,

2664
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,890
the old Vito from TRT days
was one 85 are though,

2665
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,250
until you got to a point or the most
dangerous guy in the world when he was on

2666
01:13:11,251 --> 01:13:12,570
tot someone spinning,

2667
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,710
fucking heel kicks your
eye over dude with the,

2668
01:13:14,711 --> 01:13:16,860
with the traps and the long Mohawk.

2669
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:17,911
Oh,

2670
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:18,744
he was terrified.

2671
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,741
He's no joke.

2672
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:27,130
The scary thing is he has the skills
to back all that up and he's lightening

2673
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:27,983
fast.

2674
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,160
38 now.

2675
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:30,570
He's definitely,

2676
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,100
he's definitely not in his prime.

2677
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:35,760
He was the first Brazilian to come
out with like legit box and finally a

2678
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:37,350
Brazilian with boxing shit.

2679
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,240
He came out and look at them.

2680
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:40,410
They're looking at their,

2681
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:41,310
wow,

2682
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,271
that's crazy.

2683
01:13:42,271 --> 01:13:43,410
It's a crazy difference.

2684
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,740
But here's the thing that I'm critical
weight and that's the same weight,

2685
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:47,130
right?

2686
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:47,760
Yup.

2687
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:48,450
Yup.

2688
01:13:48,450 --> 01:13:49,920
Chris Weidman had a good point though.

2689
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:50,881
He said that,

2690
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:51,120
uh,

2691
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,900
it might actually help him because he
wouldn't gas as much come on because he

2692
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:57,920
was doing so much steroids
before these beat him.

2693
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,471
But come on,

2694
01:13:58,471 --> 01:13:59,304
Chris,

2695
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:01,351
I'm just saying,

2696
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:01,981
I'm talking to Chris.

2697
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:02,814
I'm not talking to you.

2698
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:03,961
It's what he said,

2699
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:04,230
bro.

2700
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:04,861
That's what he said,

2701
01:14:04,861 --> 01:14:05,520
man,

2702
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,270
this guy's good.

2703
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:07,120
Gate guard Musashi.

2704
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,450
He always looks like he doesn't give up.

2705
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,000
Fuck No.

2706
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,230
He looks like he's bothered.

2707
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:11,410
You're there to watch him fight.

2708
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,620
Like he's upset if like if someone's like,

2709
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:14,741
Hey,

2710
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:16,180
you know Gago me Sauskia Syracuse.

2711
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:16,451
I'm like,

2712
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:16,541
yeah,

2713
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:17,374
that makes sense.

2714
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,490
Like he doesn't give a fuck about me.

2715
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,960
Fixing seems like a real nice guy.

2716
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:23,590
But he's been fighting for ever.

2717
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,543
He's legit.

2718
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,540
Remember when he knocked
out jquery with upkick?

2719
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:27,483
Yes.

2720
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:28,451
And then yeah.

2721
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,870
And then didn't Jack Gray
Fonda was triangle too.

2722
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:31,210
Yeah.

2723
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,043
Yeah.

2724
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:33,400
Yeah.

2725
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,510
He was the man and dream.

2726
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:36,720
Just Justice Tko a felony.

2727
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:37,660
You fell on this triangle,

2728
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:38,494
did he?

2729
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:39,730
He did it to somebody else.

2730
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,760
Do you hope to be triangle?

2731
01:14:40,890 --> 01:14:42,250
I remember he didn't try.

2732
01:14:42,251 --> 01:14:43,820
I thought he'd knocked
him out and drop gray.

2733
01:14:43,821 --> 01:14:46,510
Filmed or maybe just not think
he just came and got off of them,

2734
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:47,344
but I think he did that.

2735
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:48,520
I'm trying to,

2736
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:48,841
yeah,

2737
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:51,790
I think he did that to somebody else
where he makes here to triangle them.

2738
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:52,900
Yeah.

2739
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,980
Just for old time's sake.

2740
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:54,980
When you like to see via tour,

2741
01:14:54,981 --> 01:14:56,500
when you are your campaigns,

2742
01:14:56,501 --> 01:14:58,410
you're one of those guys
who wants to see a guy win.

2743
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:01,870
We don't win with this
very rare rooting here.

2744
01:15:01,871 --> 01:15:05,380
Like of course Eddie Bravo would be
rooting for Tony Ferguson when Ferguson

2745
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:07,600
fight it because it's his boy,

2746
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,900
but for the most part we watch
these fights like people I know.

2747
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,760
I know for sure.

2748
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:14,720
I've known him for a long
time and I've known gay God.

2749
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:16,000
I like both these guys.

2750
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:17,290
So I watched his fight.

2751
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:17,830
I just go like,

2752
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,430
hmm.

2753
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,130
But you're like,

2754
01:15:19,130 --> 01:15:19,211
oh,

2755
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:20,070
I want to see this crap.

2756
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,071
I like,

2757
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:21,550
Hey,

2758
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,420
I like it.

2759
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,313
I'm a fan.

2760
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:24,250
Oh me too man.

2761
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:25,083
I'm a fan.

2762
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:25,691
Yo Brendan,

2763
01:15:25,691 --> 01:15:26,524
can I get one of those?

2764
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,760
Yeah.

2765
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,500
Thank you sir.

2766
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,820
Can I get one Coronado,

2767
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:31,690
ladies and gentlemen,

2768
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:32,883
this is a,

2769
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:33,813
can you pass them?

2770
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,290
Oh,

2771
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:36,450
let's have a cup of Coronas.

2772
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,490
Kam Wants to dip into this whiskey.

2773
01:15:38,491 --> 01:15:39,320
You seem like a whiskey.

2774
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,290
We looking at that list,

2775
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:41,380
I had been eyeing it up.

2776
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:42,730
Do you want some of that Whiskey Cam?

2777
01:15:42,731 --> 01:15:44,650
We could all have a little
gentleman's glass of whiskey.

2778
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:46,210
We've got some some ice there.

2779
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:47,320
Here we go.

2780
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,640
We should celebrate your bowl.

2781
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,061
Yes,

2782
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:53,470
we should celebrate [inaudible]
moving g kegger with a nice leg kick.

2783
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:53,791
Okay,

2784
01:15:53,791 --> 01:15:54,940
I'm going to be on bias now.

2785
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:55,811
Nah,

2786
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:56,170
he can't.

2787
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:56,891
There's no going back.

2788
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:57,970
Here's the thing with gay guard.

2789
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,950
Gate guards got to be
real careful of the blitz.

2790
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:00,970
Kashi early.

2791
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:01,560
Yeah.

2792
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,400
I suspect that blitz.

2793
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,230
I feel like he's too smart for that.

2794
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,273
I hope he is.

2795
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:07,270
I think she'd get Murray.

2796
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:07,931
I think so too.

2797
01:16:07,931 --> 01:16:08,530
But there's,

2798
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:08,880
there's,

2799
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,150
there might be an attitude that some
fighters have that v tour without the TRT

2800
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,320
is very vulnerable.

2801
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,520
Not In those first two minutes.

2802
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:16,503
That's right.

2803
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,373
He was on.

2804
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:18,533
Oh.

2805
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:19,240
Oh,

2806
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,280
he's coming soggy.

2807
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:20,531
Oh,

2808
01:16:20,531 --> 01:16:21,364
and and Gagan.

2809
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:24,640
Mutombo finger.

2810
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:25,631
He gave him the,

2811
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:25,871
no,

2812
01:16:25,871 --> 01:16:26,051
no,

2813
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:26,561
no.

2814
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:27,001
Mason.

2815
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:28,060
We tumble reference,

2816
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:28,894
sir.

2817
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:29,980
I'm from Dems.

2818
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,830
K guard.

2819
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:35,170
Come on down and gay guard advances.

2820
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:36,460
You know what that means to me.

2821
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,060
That means to me that
that little finger mine,

2822
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:38,800
it had an effect.

2823
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,340
I agree.

2824
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,040
Usually guys do some
emotional like fuck them up.

2825
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:46,490
I said Lake left kick to the body and
the body or short shorts by beat door PHR

2826
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:47,373
swinging,

2827
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,820
fico vittores swinging.

2828
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:49,640
Well that's the,

2829
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,473
to be able to kick,

2830
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,220
you know,

2831
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:55,540
that's the worst thing about
some boy to both landed.

2832
01:16:55,570 --> 01:16:56,980
The worst thing about them,

2833
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:58,210
regular Moy Thai shorts.

2834
01:16:58,211 --> 01:16:59,950
You ever see those tigers
are always rolling them up?

2835
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:00,370
Yeah.

2836
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,130
Like sometimes those
fuckers bind your legs.

2837
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:03,101
John Dodson,

2838
01:17:03,101 --> 01:17:05,320
where's Capris his are so big to be seen.

2839
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:05,590
His,

2840
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:07,030
their show baggy.

2841
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,830
I think the move is the tights.

2842
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,590
I think everybody should be forced to
wear the tights because you don't like why

2843
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:12,770
not?

2844
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,570
Why or why not do the
single like the old school?

2845
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,790
It's Kinda like the speedo style.

2846
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:20,240
Brazilian speedo dams like hold up.

2847
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:20,800
What do you mean?

2848
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,950
Wow guys?

2849
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:24,770
Well come on is just a part of it.

2850
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:25,880
Part of the fun.

2851
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,310
So I'm crazy with zoom goes,

2852
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:30,250
but you want to see him
on a fucking grasp book.

2853
01:17:30,251 --> 01:17:34,040
All that beautiful takedown defense by
[inaudible] Gago I tried to close it for

2854
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:34,920
the takedown of Vidyard.

2855
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:35,451
Vittores like,

2856
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:35,661
bitch,

2857
01:17:35,661 --> 01:17:37,010
I've been fighting for 20 years.

2858
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,400
Yeah,

2859
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:37,910
come on bitch.

2860
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,030
Okay,

2861
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:38,863
check this out.

2862
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,640
I my master's degree and take this
knee to the body on the way outside.

2863
01:17:43,290 --> 01:17:44,680
Oh and two.

2864
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:45,111
That's one.

2865
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:45,800
Two from me.

2866
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:48,450
His speed hasn't left and that's
not usually the last thing to go.

2867
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,380
I mean the first thing to,

2868
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:49,671
you know,

2869
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:50,630
what else hasn't left him,

2870
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:51,650
his work ethic,

2871
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,410
fee tours and notoriously
hard worker in the gym.

2872
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,850
Everybody that worked with them.

2873
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,450
I did a training st coaches
saying tell me insane.

2874
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:00,284
Talked to me.

2875
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,151
He just a,

2876
01:18:01,151 --> 01:18:01,341
you know,

2877
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:01,640
it's all,

2878
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,760
he's the first guy that I really
knew who did like a super camp,

2879
01:18:04,761 --> 01:18:05,990
which it's just about him.

2880
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,940
Like he brought any
specific training partners,

2881
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,510
brown GSP named my car myself when
he's fighting Anthony Johnson,

2882
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:13,520
he brought in just this
core group of guys,

2883
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,600
no shows for him.

2884
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:15,950
And then he'd have his Jujitsu coach,

2885
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:16,790
they're wrestling coach,

2886
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:18,200
striking coach all times,

2887
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,430
which I was a good fight.

2888
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:23,750
They just disbar with them are grappling
Anthony Johnson when he choked out

2889
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:25,500
Anthony Johnson at once 70 no,

2890
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:28,100
it was one 81 85 and 90
Johnson didn't make weight.

2891
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:28,670
Yes.

2892
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,630
That was in Brazil.

2893
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:29,991
Correct.

2894
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:30,250
And,

2895
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:34,370
and Johnson puts a storm on them and
the first round that rumble storm and he

2896
01:18:34,371 --> 01:18:37,580
survived the storm and it was a big
fight for Vituro because you overcame

2897
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:38,120
adversity.

2898
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:38,953
Yep.

2899
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,370
Trouble after that storm.

2900
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:40,581
Yeah.

2901
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:41,021
And then he choked.

2902
01:18:41,021 --> 01:18:41,854
Rumba has done,

2903
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,800
yeah,

2904
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,520
because gas back to anyways because
he was losing way too much weight.

2905
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:48,470
The rumble of today is different.

2906
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:51,290
Like if you watched the rumble of
today when he fought Phil Davis,

2907
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,160
he went three heart beat Phil Davis up.

2908
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:55,700
Yeah.

2909
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,840
It's different rumble.

2910
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,740
It's two different rubber.

2911
01:18:57,741 --> 01:18:58,100
Sure.

2912
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,720
Wayne when he's at two oh five.

2913
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:01,030
But Dan,

2914
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,710
if you want to like make that argument,

2915
01:19:03,711 --> 01:19:07,190
Daniel Cormier was able to weather the
storm and he grounded them out and then

2916
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,060
he choked him out.

2917
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:09,380
But he,

2918
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,213
that's a fight I was saying.

2919
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:10,850
Yeah,

2920
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,420
he sad,

2921
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,253
he sucked him dry.

2922
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:15,890
But you have to also realize them
dry gives me so I'm not in that way.

2923
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:16,940
I mean like his energy.

2924
01:19:16,970 --> 01:19:17,803
How dare you.

2925
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,733
Jesus Christ.

2926
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:20,783
Nor,

2927
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:22,570
I'm sorry it was dry.

2928
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:23,923
I'm,

2929
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:26,743
I wasn't either.

2930
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:28,550
I was thinking in terms of like,

2931
01:19:28,551 --> 01:19:28,790
uh,

2932
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,110
like almost like a spider.

2933
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:30,321
Yeah.

2934
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:31,800
Do you see a Sucky d?

2935
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:34,340
DC is such old grinder,

2936
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:35,480
you know like he wears that shirt,

2937
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:36,314
the king of the grind.

2938
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,300
That shit breaks the ground.

2939
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:37,720
Yeah.

2940
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,553
Embraces no,

2941
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:39,670
he is a king of the grind show.

2942
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:40,630
Embrace the no,

2943
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:41,630
embrace the grind.

2944
01:19:41,631 --> 01:19:44,930
Everybody know that Stacy's thing but
doesn't he have a shirt that says king of

2945
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:45,764
the grind?

2946
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:46,280
I don't.

2947
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,113
Is it,

2948
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,370
why do I think he had he had,

2949
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:49,820
he had though is embrace the grind.

2950
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,570
Definitely that's,

2951
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,370
that's a wrestling statement but that's,

2952
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,840
he thought God

2953
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,780
they'll want to again,

2954
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,100
he had the king of the grind too.

2955
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:58,940
I might be mistaken.

2956
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,793
I mean you to be right.

2957
01:19:59,810 --> 01:20:00,740
Oh that can't be done.

2958
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:01,603
There it is.

2959
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,533
Thank you.

2960
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,670
I thought it was mistaken but anyway,

2961
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,113
Brendan,

2962
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:10,500
I wasn't sure but he does both.

2963
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,460
He wears embraced the grunge short cage
fighter and then you would still need of

2964
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:18,390
the body by Louise Hasi but what my
point was would that DC was able to front

2965
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:19,200
and back.

2966
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,900
You got them both.

2967
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:20,733
Oh,

2968
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:21,031
both.

2969
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:21,300
Right.

2970
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:21,960
Okay.

2971
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,350
My point was that DC was
able to drain Johnson.

2972
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:25,690
He,

2973
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:29,340
he eventually got him to the point where
you could tell rumble was braking and

2974
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:30,031
he was going to crack.

2975
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:30,780
He broke as well.

2976
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:31,351
He broke as well.

2977
01:20:31,351 --> 01:20:31,681
He did.

2978
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:32,310
He just kind of,

2979
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:33,180
he gave him his neck,

2980
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:33,670
didn't he?

2981
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,503
Toward it.

2982
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,070
But the thing is he was training for Jon
Jones was most likely going to strike

2983
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,320
with them and instead
he got Daniel Cormier.

2984
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:43,380
I one of the best wrestlers
to ever fucking do it in MMA.

2985
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:47,580
I mean not the best and
amendment world class.

2986
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:48,780
Just don't see what's resume.

2987
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,310
You've got to watch him when he fights.

2988
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,740
Josh Barnett to appreciate
how fucking good his Ross,

2989
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:56,550
Josh didn't break his hand that fight
though early on sort of Daniel Daniel

2990
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:57,810
broke his hand too and he did.

2991
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:01,500
Molly welcome scoops him up in the
air and throws him to the ground.

2992
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,280
And this is a heavyweight Barnett who
was the youngest UFC heavyweight champion

2993
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:05,521
ever.

2994
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:07,460
And Daniel Cormier hoists him.

2995
01:21:07,461 --> 01:21:12,300
I only 60 white and just fucking
throws him on the ground.

2996
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:17,301
When you realize like watching the shifts
and he does it off this power single.

2997
01:21:17,551 --> 01:21:18,120
Look at this.

2998
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,320
Watch how he hoists him up here.

2999
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:20,183
Look at this.

3000
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,630
Come on son.

3001
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,590
That's how Columbia and bloody
remember what he did to Dan Henderson.

3002
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:28,520
He did the exact same move to
den Huston but literally like

3003
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:32,750
WWF and little hints.

3004
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:33,780
A little like a little kid.

3005
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:38,820
Now that is some serious world class
throwing ability and the Henderson fight,

3006
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:41,520
he did that about 10 times.

3007
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:43,490
That's how God does tough Dan Harris.

3008
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:45,180
It is running around like a rag doll.

3009
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:49,530
This is a clear difference in size
and horsepower and wrestling ability.

3010
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,600
I mean all of their crowd
beat the shit out of them.

3011
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:54,870
Beat the brakes off of him for three
rounds and also the guys at that level,

3012
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:55,651
he's choked him out.

3013
01:21:55,651 --> 01:21:55,980
Right?

3014
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,390
Did he choke damn asleep?

3015
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,080
Yeah,

3016
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,330
and guys at that level that,

3017
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:00,270
that wrestling level,

3018
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:02,400
there's really no catching
up when they're that good.

3019
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,473
So good.

3020
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:05,580
Like I'm the only two guys
I've arrested were like,

3021
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:05,701
oh,

3022
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:06,510
there's just no,

3023
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,010
there's nothing I can do is DC.

3024
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:08,541
He literally,

3025
01:22:08,541 --> 01:22:09,120
I was it guy.

3026
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,200
What the hell am I going to do here?

3027
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,430
And a King Mo.

3028
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,630
Oh yeah.

3029
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:14,060
And their poise and how's it all right?

3030
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:17,910
You know what King Mall is
one of those guys where you,

3031
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:18,631
when you saw him,

3032
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:20,130
the early parts of his career,

3033
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:24,030
he thought this guy has all the
potential to be like an all time great.

3034
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,240
Like a serious world
championship caliber wrestler.

3035
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:29,990
Set a really good career as a w yeah,

3036
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,290
he has had a really good career,

3037
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:36,291
but I feel like what's the latest
was in the UFC like early on,

3038
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:37,530
like more people would know

3039
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,740
it with him.

3040
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:41,461
A,

3041
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,620
he's thought probably the
nicest guy in the room be.

3042
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,600
He might be the best fighter coach I've
ever met my life to really didn't lose

3043
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,980
the weight the way you break
it down in a split decision.

3044
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:55,080
And that was to fight for the
world title the bell to Champ Liam.

3045
01:22:55,081 --> 01:22:55,470
Yeah,

3046
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,251
with a crazy one.

3047
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,060
Was he fought,

3048
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:57,510
uh,

3049
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:58,201
what's his name?

3050
01:22:58,201 --> 01:23:01,230
Emmanuel Emmanuel spinning the spinning

3051
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:03,750
crazy stuff.

3052
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:04,590
That takedown again.

3053
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,370
It'd Ooh,

3054
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,060
a little blood coming out
of the forehead toward,

3055
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:08,681
that's nothing.

3056
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:09,010
No,

3057
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,610
but King Mo was Merkin guys can America.

3058
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:11,800
He'd go over to dream,

3059
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:12,071
do that,

3060
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:13,330
and then bounce back here.

3061
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:16,450
He's had a weird career path.

3062
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:18,000
Remember when he knocked
out south patches?

3063
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:19,540
Ellie too nasty.

3064
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:22,000
Beautiful Jab by most Aussie.

3065
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:24,970
See now [inaudible] that
blitz is not as effective.

3066
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:28,240
You're in the second round and this is
what Musashi predicted that he was going

3067
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,074
to stop.

3068
01:23:29,990 --> 01:23:31,330
Oh Shit.

3069
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:33,780
Upper cuts.

3070
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,630
It's close over sun.

3071
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,910
Almost Sassy looks insane.

3072
01:23:38,911 --> 01:23:39,744
God

3073
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,060
tore survived that.

3074
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,930
That flurry that that
went down like that was,

3075
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:48,991
oh beautiful.

3076
01:23:48,991 --> 01:23:52,920
Throw on this fight is in
grave devotee being stopped.

3077
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,360
Waved jeopardy is what I just said.

3078
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,670
This impressive verocity.

3079
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,810
God Damn we saw us.

3080
01:23:57,811 --> 01:23:59,430
He hasn't slowed down one bit.

3081
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:00,880
Cardio is and say,

3082
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:01,111
Hey,

3083
01:24:01,111 --> 01:24:04,860
I'm an impressive feat or for weather
that harm because those elbows and he's

3084
01:24:04,861 --> 01:24:05,001
still,

3085
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:06,940
he's holding the back of his
neck and throwing the install.

3086
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:07,970
No,

3087
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:09,810
he's fucking,

3088
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,400
he's smashing the tour.

3089
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,633
It's over.

3090
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:17,520
Oh,

3091
01:24:17,521 --> 01:24:18,354
incredible.

3092
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:20,250
Incredible.

3093
01:24:20,251 --> 01:24:21,031
Incredible.

3094
01:24:21,031 --> 01:24:22,520
UFC card.

3095
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,220
It ain't daddy's got to put them in for,

3096
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:24,490
oh,

3097
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:24,961
what's he went?

3098
01:24:24,961 --> 01:24:25,800
Three quarter mill.

3099
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:26,341
Oh,

3100
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:27,174
full mouthful.

3101
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,800
Oh,

3102
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:31,520
feet towards getting smushed to 30 left.

3103
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:33,150
This a long time left.

3104
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:33,271
Yeah.

3105
01:24:33,271 --> 01:24:36,480
That's an eternity for with those landing.

3106
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:37,470
You got to stop the fight,

3107
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:38,304
man.

3108
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:39,480
That's it.

3109
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,141
Wow.

3110
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:40,921
Musashi.

3111
01:24:40,921 --> 01:24:41,754
Look fat.

3112
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,430
She's this jab at what?

3113
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,370
85 to I think.

3114
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,300
Wow.

3115
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,960
That was some brutal striking
on his part and he a one man.

3116
01:24:48,961 --> 01:24:50,070
He predicted it.

3117
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,320
He said he just stop in the second round.

3118
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:52,921
He said,

3119
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,480
I'm going to weather a
storm in the first round.

3120
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:55,710
I'm going to stop in the second round.

3121
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,320
Doesn't feed or have to be close.

3122
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:58,741
Yeah.

3123
01:24:58,741 --> 01:25:00,270
He's 39 I mean,

3124
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,920
should be over close to sign with Bella.

3125
01:25:01,921 --> 01:25:03,080
Turn you back on tr

3126
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,940
right.

3127
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:06,900
That's what I was talking about.

3128
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,250
That's what I assumed you were going for.

3129
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:12,593
Yes.

3130
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:13,790
Kickstarted

3131
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:15,830
off while he rattled them
with that high kick man.

3132
01:25:15,831 --> 01:25:20,000
That right hand to the vittores in trouble
and look at this Musashi saucy coming

3133
01:25:20,001 --> 01:25:21,890
on like an Armenian demon.

3134
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,970
Whoa.

3135
01:25:23,030 --> 01:25:23,601
God.

3136
01:25:23,601 --> 01:25:24,430
Kick boom.

3137
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,263
Right hand.

3138
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:26,510
Holy Shit.

3139
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:28,040
Look at this combination.

3140
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:28,940
I know for cuts.

3141
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:29,931
Oh my God.

3142
01:25:29,931 --> 01:25:31,910
Vittores just hardening.

3143
01:25:31,911 --> 01:25:36,110
Whether they're tar Yolana combination.

3144
01:25:36,111 --> 01:25:39,500
Remember that whoever she
was lightened up and Ne Yeah,

3145
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,520
Jessica Pinay.

3146
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,350
God Damn.

3147
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:42,801
Real good.

3148
01:25:42,801 --> 01:25:43,341
Stoppage.

3149
01:25:43,341 --> 01:25:44,180
Real good stoppage.

3150
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:44,880
Yeah.

3151
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,680
I gave them all the chances in the
world to recover because he was kind of,

3152
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:51,560
you give them a little bit of leniency,

3153
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:51,980
right?

3154
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,340
God damn sauce.

3155
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,240
Good.

3156
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,073
Yeah.

3157
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:57,770
That was like his best performance.

3158
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,350
His best performance in the UFC for sure.

3159
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,440
That's a big win.

3160
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:02,060
When is he,

3161
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:02,420
when,

3162
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:03,253
when his,

3163
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,730
when was his last win?

3164
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,090
Uh,

3165
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:07,390
Dan Harrison stopped down.

3166
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,420
Henderson the first round.

3167
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:10,000
That was a little bit ago.

3168
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,570
It was while ago,

3169
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,560
I think it was two years ago.

3170
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:15,650
And they send the golden snitch
said you want to do what he,

3171
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:18,710
that was a last TRT fight.

3172
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:21,170
I think that was his last TRT fight,

3173
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,243
correct sir?

3174
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,083
No,

3175
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:27,200
I think it was post TRT stopped
him in the first round again.

3176
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:27,860
Hmm.

3177
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:30,370
He stopped him one time when he was scary.

3178
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,980
[inaudible] they fought a few
times and the Henderson beat him.

3179
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,980
Henderson beat him by
decision and pride then scary.

3180
01:26:36,981 --> 01:26:41,981
Trt v Two r stopped Henderson in the first
round and then non Trt v tore stopped

3181
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:44,250
Henderson again the first round too.

3182
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:47,360
I'm pretty sure my right

3183
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:50,960
when that head kick.

3184
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,670
What's the date on the rock holders?

3185
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:53,241
For sure.

3186
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,074
Trt.

3187
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,970
Dan Henderson was for sure TRT.

3188
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,720
Then the last of Chris Weidman
and then Dan Henderson again.

3189
01:26:58,721 --> 01:26:59,554
So lawyers.

3190
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:00,440
Yeah,

3191
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,340
he was deflated.

3192
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:02,720
Where was that fight though?

3193
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,130
That which ones he fight night.

3194
01:27:04,131 --> 01:27:06,470
77 zeal was at Brazil.

3195
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:07,900
He might not be in Brazil.

3196
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:08,990
Where's it say,

3197
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,823
where's does it say?

3198
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:11,243
I'm like,

3199
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:12,560
do I have skeptical Hipaa lies?

3200
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:14,313
Sure.

3201
01:27:15,010 --> 01:27:20,010
I'll Paulo skeptical hip out
does not think that Vito was,

3202
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:20,901
yeah,

3203
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:22,150
he wasn't even a year ago.

3204
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:22,880
Yeah.

3205
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,800
So I guess that was a year

3206
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,650
in boxing.

3207
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:28,850
Those records are shit.

3208
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:29,690
Yeah.

3209
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:29,811
Oh,

3210
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:30,680
you don't have a career.

3211
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,250
It's crazy,

3212
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,083
right?

3213
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,850
You can't lose or you could
have like one or two losses.

3214
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:36,400
Like Canelo has pencil this.

3215
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,343
Yeah,

3216
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:39,020
let me know.

3217
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,790
I don't watch boxing that much,

3218
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:41,930
but up in big bear,

3219
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:42,800
uh,

3220
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:43,401
one of the guys,

3221
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:45,020
one of the trainers that
are turned me on to,

3222
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,670
there's this Russian guy,

3223
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,153
he's a triple g.

3224
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:56,810
He's on a lot of saw the highlight reel
of his who get Gennady Golovkin good

3225
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:58,850
number.

3226
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:59,683
Yeah,

3227
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:00,943
it's amazing,

3228
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:01,973
right?

3229
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,430
There's like three of the
world's best fighters.

3230
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:06,290
If you have the top 10
world best fighters,

3231
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:08,860
three of them right now
in terms of boxing or,

3232
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:13,040
or Russians facility Lowman
Chanko I mean that guy is insane.

3233
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:17,360
It's probably my favorite to watch one
of the best boxers like you'll ever like,

3234
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,120
it's far as pure boxing
technique like an all time.

3235
01:28:20,121 --> 01:28:22,970
Great red a top three guys.

3236
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:24,463
Coleville I'm sorry.

3237
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:25,401
No,

3238
01:28:25,401 --> 01:28:26,280
not the top for now.

3239
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:30,830
Sergei Kovalev is fighting Andre Ward and
both of those guys are like top in the

3240
01:28:30,831 --> 01:28:31,190
world.

3241
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:31,670
This is good.

3242
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,930
How to get Lufkin right here.

3243
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:33,381
Eddie,

3244
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:36,200
this is a highlight reel of
Golovkin is the one I saw.

3245
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,490
He's a monster.

3246
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,480
He's so good.

3247
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,250
He just fucks guys up.

3248
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,900
He has to fight Canelo next year.

3249
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:42,261
Yeah,

3250
01:28:42,261 --> 01:28:43,820
we'll kidney a fight.

3251
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:46,060
Floyd Mayweather is that way was to,

3252
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:48,650
is not going to want to have nothing
to do with this motherfucker.

3253
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:50,683
Big

3254
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,880
Tubes at one 60 look at that left toe.

3255
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:57,290
Are People talking about it?

3256
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:57,531
No,

3257
01:28:57,531 --> 01:28:58,151
not at all.

3258
01:28:58,151 --> 01:28:58,800
No Floyd.

3259
01:28:58,800 --> 01:28:59,800
The one nothing to do with this.

3260
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:00,591
The first of all,

3261
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:02,010
Super Canelo Eddie,

3262
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,250
here's the thing about whether,

3263
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,150
so you would think that that he's so big.

3264
01:29:06,151 --> 01:29:07,320
He did that for the money.

3265
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:08,154
He was young.

3266
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,300
10 news going to lose,

3267
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:09,771
but the,

3268
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:14,630
the real fight is right now because
Canelo has never been better and then the

3269
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:15,421
cause they can fight.

3270
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:15,601
Man.

3271
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:16,700
It'd be so fun.

3272
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:18,870
Canelo's a big one.

3273
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:19,900
54 too.

3274
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,000
But I'm into it.

3275
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,210
But here's like the thing of poker,

3276
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:22,720
not eagle off.

3277
01:29:22,720 --> 01:29:23,620
Can they had a paper,

3278
01:29:23,621 --> 01:29:27,210
have you fight with him recently
and it did not do well not draw.

3279
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:29,070
The problem is most people
don't know who he is,

3280
01:29:29,071 --> 01:29:32,220
whereas Canelo Alvarez
is a fucking superstar.

3281
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,001
He's the biggest draw.

3282
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:34,210
Unboxing canals.

3283
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:37,380
He's been knocking everyone out.

3284
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:38,730
Just torturing people.

3285
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:39,211
Yeah,

3286
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:39,721
he's fortunate.

3287
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:40,291
He's never looked,

3288
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,124
never lost.

3289
01:29:41,370 --> 01:29:43,890
He said some good fights
that the guy that he fought,

3290
01:29:43,891 --> 01:29:44,570
the last one,

3291
01:29:44,570 --> 01:29:44,840
um,

3292
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,391
that they uh,

3293
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:46,230
they stopped the fight.

3294
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,670
Oh,

3295
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:47,960
he his corner.

3296
01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:48,900
Stop the fight early.

3297
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:49,590
Oh No,

3298
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:49,801
that,

3299
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:50,070
that,

3300
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,940
that's triple G.

3301
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:51,331
Yeah.

3302
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:52,140
So you're talking about,

3303
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:52,973
that's what I'm talking about.

3304
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:56,840
I was talking about Canelo
triple g is amazing.

3305
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,260
When he fired a,

3306
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,100
what is his Canelo fought Liam
Smith and a triple g fought.

3307
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,043
Um,

3308
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:05,310
oh God damn it.

3309
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,181
The English guy.

3310
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:06,570
And he was,

3311
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:08,100
it wasn't Inglese corner
threw in the towel,

3312
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,570
his corner through in
the tower and he was,

3313
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,980
he was getting beat up
by glove guide by him.

3314
01:30:11,981 --> 01:30:12,541
CTE.

3315
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:13,230
I can't remember.

3316
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:14,070
I can't remember it either.

3317
01:30:14,071 --> 01:30:15,050
I don't think it's Ct.

3318
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,960
You can't brush

3319
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:20,370
Mayweather's daddy's not necessarily.

3320
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:22,470
He might be hanging around waiting for,

3321
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:24,780
well if Manny [inaudible] more time.

3322
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,670
If Manny wants to fight one more time too.

3323
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,110
I think it would be gigantic cause man,

3324
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:28,891
he's still fighting.

3325
01:30:28,891 --> 01:30:30,000
He's fighting against soon.

3326
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,050
You can cure this.

3327
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:31,980
Here's Gennady.

3328
01:30:31,980 --> 01:30:33,480
Gennady Golovkin they stop.

3329
01:30:33,510 --> 01:30:36,390
He stops a Kell Brook Kell Brook.

3330
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,180
This first time I thought triple g look.

3331
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:39,014
Cumin.

3332
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,540
Well,

3333
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:42,390
Brooke has really good man
and we didn't go shopping.

3334
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:42,650
Yeah,

3335
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:44,570
but he came up two weight
class canonical often.

3336
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:45,450
Tko Kell.

3337
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,081
Oh,

3338
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:47,660
this is just a Shitty,

3339
01:30:47,661 --> 01:30:48,690
a HBO thing.

3340
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,040
I mean it's just so good.

3341
01:30:50,041 --> 01:30:52,000
But your boy cove 11 ward fighting.

3342
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:52,291
Oh man,

3343
01:30:52,291 --> 01:30:53,810
that's a fucking fight.

3344
01:30:53,811 --> 01:30:54,644
It's a gray box.

3345
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:55,340
Never been better.

3346
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:59,260
I'm so crunk unboxing and
then Tyson fury went crazy.

3347
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:00,180
I love it when you say,

3348
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,840
I'm so crunk on something I give so
crunk then I never get to use that word

3349
01:31:03,841 --> 01:31:04,520
either.

3350
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:05,430
It's a great word.

3351
01:31:05,431 --> 01:31:07,770
Crunk Tyson fury his gun.

3352
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:08,670
He's just nuts.

3353
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,200
He has a mental issue.

3354
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,520
You just can't deal with it.

3355
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,140
So now the timeout Klich go first.

3356
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:14,791
Anthony,

3357
01:31:14,791 --> 01:31:15,624
Joshua,

3358
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,340
Joshua.

3359
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:19,380
He's like the golden boy in England.

3360
01:31:19,381 --> 01:31:21,430
So it was Tyson fury going
to step away from that title.

3361
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:21,610
Yeah,

3362
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:22,443
he's retired.

3363
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:23,640
He retired.

3364
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:26,380
No black guy bodied up for a day.

3365
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,650
But Tyson fury is a traveler.

3366
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:29,910
Tyson fury as a traveler.

3367
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:31,741
But they call it,

3368
01:31:31,741 --> 01:31:32,970
I think they call themselves travelers,

3369
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:34,380
but he calls himself a white guy.

3370
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:35,243
He's a white guy.

3371
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:36,880
A beat is another white guy.

3372
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:38,123
Beat another way.

3373
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:39,770
Weight Division.

3374
01:31:40,210 --> 01:31:42,240
I led a couple of Joe White guys,

3375
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:43,800
but most scary guys,

3376
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:44,634
black guy,

3377
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,210
two of them.

3378
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:45,571
Anthony,

3379
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:46,404
Joshua.

3380
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:53,130
Oh and don't forget Shannon motherfucking
breaks people still sleeping on

3381
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:53,850
channel.

3382
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:54,631
Nobody wants a fight.

3383
01:31:54,631 --> 01:31:55,464
That guy,

3384
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,001
he's older,

3385
01:31:57,001 --> 01:31:58,450
so he's like 43 years old.

3386
01:31:59,020 --> 01:31:59,980
It's 43 years old,

3387
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:01,160
but he's still not motherfucker.

3388
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:06,430
Let me say what David.

3389
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:06,850
Hello.

3390
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,080
David Haye doesn't want to fight him.

3391
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:09,360
David has been tried.

3392
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:09,701
Josh,

3393
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:10,600
he's a bad motherfucker,

3394
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:13,480
but David Haye has been
running away from a fight with,

3395
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:15,370
with Shannon.

3396
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:16,970
Shannon breaks channel the camp.

3397
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:17,640
He was,

3398
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:18,540
how old is he?

3399
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,440
He's 43 Casey Anthony.

3400
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:24,070
Joshua was having an issue with
getting a fight because I'm sure he's a

3401
01:32:24,071 --> 01:32:24,851
dangerous guy.

3402
01:32:24,851 --> 01:32:25,810
Super Dangerous.

3403
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:26,644
Amazing guy.

3404
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,513
Personality.

3405
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:28,713
Come on,

3406
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:29,860
Shit.

3407
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:30,670
That's,

3408
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:31,503
that's him right there.

3409
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:32,190
Shannon.

3410
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:33,700
Shannon breaks dude.

3411
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:35,110
Nice go champ.

3412
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:40,530
He's a bad motherfucker and he is one
of the best guys to follow on Instagram.

3413
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,710
He does Instagram.

3414
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:45,544
He'll do these videos,

3415
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:45,940
wages,

3416
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,050
he everything he says,

3417
01:32:47,051 --> 01:32:47,351
he says,

3418
01:32:47,351 --> 01:32:48,130
let's go champ.

3419
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:48,701
He's always saying,

3420
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:49,534
let's go champ.

3421
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:50,101
Let's go cheat.

3422
01:32:50,101 --> 01:32:51,880
Cause everybody a chance to chat.

3423
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:52,763
There's no variety.

3424
01:32:52,970 --> 01:32:54,010
But he's like,

3425
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:54,341
he'll,

3426
01:32:54,341 --> 01:32:55,630
he'll like be working out.

3427
01:32:55,631 --> 01:32:56,620
He's dancing chair.

3428
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,560
He starts singing do cute.

3429
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,060
He wanted to fight with Klitschko and
so he went on a boat while Klitschko was

3430
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:06,580
paddle boarding and just
start fucking come on,

3431
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:07,480
fight me,

3432
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:07,911
fuck me.

3433
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:10,780
And drove the boat around and
made them fall in the water.

3434
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:11,570
Then he's crazy.

3435
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:12,220
Was good.

3436
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:12,970
Oh yeah.

3437
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:14,560
Just talking and talking
and he's hilarious.

3438
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,091
He's hilarious.

3439
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:16,330
He wants to fight him that he's older.

3440
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:16,501
It's,

3441
01:33:16,501 --> 01:33:16,931
it's a tough,

3442
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:17,950
it's a dangerous fight.

3443
01:33:17,951 --> 01:33:18,671
Super Dad.

3444
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:19,600
You see super skill.

3445
01:33:19,601 --> 01:33:22,750
He's got nasty power and he's got
a vicious left hook to the body.

3446
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,340
He throws a left hook to the body.

3447
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:25,330
It's like a laser beam.

3448
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:27,130
It's like it just hits you in the liver.

3449
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:30,760
I thought he was retired and one
like did bell like 20 years ago.

3450
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,580
He's now than he's ever
looked physically in his life.

3451
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:35,021
He gets a shot,

3452
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:37,270
but I don't see one of these
young guys doing is him.

3453
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:39,550
Was he working out here is
what we're going to say?

3454
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:40,391
Yeah,

3455
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:40,721
Dude.

3456
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:41,554
He's a bad motherfucker.

3457
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:42,071
Hell yeah.

3458
01:33:42,071 --> 01:33:42,351
He can't.

3459
01:33:42,351 --> 01:33:43,510
It breaks is no joke.

3460
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:44,710
Come on.

3461
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:45,131
And he goes,

3462
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:45,760
chat.

3463
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:46,593
Come on.

3464
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:48,003
Those are,

3465
01:33:48,610 --> 01:33:49,001
this is,

3466
01:33:49,001 --> 01:33:49,121
see,

3467
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:50,610
this is just shots.

3468
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:51,341
Yeah.

3469
01:33:51,341 --> 01:33:53,910
This isn't like him doing a
great job marketing though.

3470
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:54,611
Social media.

3471
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:54,941
Yeah.

3472
01:33:54,941 --> 01:33:55,571
He's incredible.

3473
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:56,820
Best in the game at boxing.

3474
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:57,663
Better than yeah,

3475
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,020
he's got power mat.

3476
01:33:59,080 --> 01:33:59,530
Oh yeah.

3477
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:00,880
I mean what he's doing right here is just,

3478
01:34:00,881 --> 01:34:01,540
you know,

3479
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:02,950
repetitive techniques over and over.

3480
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,180
Don't want to fight on a blast.

3481
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,080
That power punch.

3482
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:07,330
But he's got real good head movement.

3483
01:34:07,331 --> 01:34:08,560
Real slick boxing.

3484
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:09,341
He knows his shit.

3485
01:34:09,341 --> 01:34:10,480
He sets traps.

3486
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:13,840
He's not like go like a one dimensional
slugger by any stretch of the

3487
01:34:13,841 --> 01:34:14,381
imagination.

3488
01:34:14,381 --> 01:34:15,040
I'm a fan,

3489
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,610
but he's got,

3490
01:34:15,610 --> 01:34:16,750
I don't see it happening though.

3491
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:20,710
The zone boats went for a long
period where he too was depressed.

3492
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:21,850
He wasn't in a good place.

3493
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:22,300
Yeah.

3494
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:23,081
He talks about it.

3495
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:25,060
He got real fat and got
up to like 300 pounds.

3496
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:27,060
He said 404 no.

3497
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:27,491
Yeah,

3498
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:28,210
we can do that.

3499
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,310
I was just going to have it
on the rocks like a gentleman.

3500
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:32,040
But you want to do shots
like some of our barrier.

3501
01:34:33,220 --> 01:34:34,690
I didn't know it was a frat house.

3502
01:34:34,691 --> 01:34:34,871
I was,

3503
01:34:34,871 --> 01:34:36,100
I was just going to hang on your rocks.

3504
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:37,980
I can goddamn gentlemen too.

3505
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,221
Yeah.

3506
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:39,580
If you,

3507
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,790
if you show show

3508
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:43,660
show,

3509
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:43,961
show,

3510
01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:47,020
like see if you find like a
highlight of video of him.

3511
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,530
Powerful main event coming up
or both been Shannon Briggs.

3512
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:55,450
I love Shannon break too man with the
main event and he's got the old man's yes.

3513
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:56,471
I was like,

3514
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:57,304
there's no way

3515
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:59,643
one

3516
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:02,463
junior like

3517
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:04,900
how's Java is doing?

3518
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,920
He's still in the mix.

3519
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:07,781
He's still in the mix.

3520
01:35:07,781 --> 01:35:08,614
He's just lazy.

3521
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,900
That's the excuse the rub on him.

3522
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:13,210
What about Hector Camacho?

3523
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,001
Look at this.

3524
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:14,550
Shannon.

3525
01:35:14,550 --> 01:35:14,861
Shannon,

3526
01:35:14,861 --> 01:35:15,694
this was just,

3527
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:17,343
Yup,

3528
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:18,493
that's Klitschko.

3529
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:18,831
No,

3530
01:35:18,831 --> 01:35:19,790
the Shannon Briggs,

3531
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:21,790
but look dude,

3532
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:22,520
I dunno.

3533
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,353
Some scrub,

3534
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:24,370
some brilliance.

3535
01:35:24,370 --> 01:35:27,950
My trees about a hundred pounds lighter.

3536
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:29,650
Emilio's erotic.

3537
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,670
My apologies Emilio.

3538
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:31,501
Just fucking around.

3539
01:35:31,501 --> 01:35:31,761
You know,

3540
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:33,170
scrub to look at this.

3541
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,940
Look at this fucking
beautiful combination,

3542
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:35,450
man.

3543
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:36,560
This is a dangerous guy.

3544
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:38,090
Nobody wants to fuck with him right now.

3545
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:41,630
Shannon brakes has a real hard time
getting fights for a real good reason

3546
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,820
because he's fucking dangerous,

3547
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:44,673
man.

3548
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:45,320
The body,

3549
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,090
you know who you should fight or t's.

3550
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,880
How many heavyweights do you
know that move like this?

3551
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:53,120
Did he tell you a lot of time off
and then I'll never stop fighting.

3552
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:54,140
He took some time off.

3553
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:54,650
Time off.

3554
01:35:54,650 --> 01:35:54,801
Yeah.

3555
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:55,760
It took some time off.

3556
01:35:55,761 --> 01:35:56,270
He went to,

3557
01:35:56,270 --> 01:35:57,140
he had depression.

3558
01:35:57,730 --> 01:35:58,563
Wait.

3559
01:35:59,090 --> 01:35:59,200
Oh,

3560
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,660
he went to Bob.

3561
01:35:59,660 --> 01:35:59,961
No,

3562
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:00,710
he didn't take that off.

3563
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:01,380
Just messing around.

3564
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:01,661
He's old.

3565
01:36:01,661 --> 01:36:04,970
He took some time off a long stretch,

3566
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:05,301
man.

3567
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,134
Where the game,

3568
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:09,710
look at this left toe
like this combination.

3569
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:10,221
Backed that up.

3570
01:36:10,221 --> 01:36:11,054
A few seconds.

3571
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:13,430
Look bad shit.

3572
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:14,323
Watch this shit.

3573
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:16,040
He's standing right in front of the dude.

3574
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,510
He's moving away from punches.

3575
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:18,350
Good head movement.

3576
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,513
This,

3577
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:20,390
he gets in tight.

3578
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,440
Rip Sign.

3579
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:22,611
No,

3580
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,450
he's a monster.

3581
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:27,860
He's a fighter or teas.

3582
01:36:27,861 --> 01:36:28,251
Come on.

3583
01:36:28,251 --> 01:36:29,690
Just finding a white guy
with all due respect.

3584
01:36:30,010 --> 01:36:31,190
Got Still Brazilian guy.

3585
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:32,080
It's hard.

3586
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:32,840
It's hard to judge.

3587
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:33,673
He's whiter.

3588
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,000
I,

3589
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,521
I'm telling you,

3590
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:35,600
I get the matchup for him.

3591
01:36:35,601 --> 01:36:38,450
He needs to fight that
dude or tease out of Cuba.

3592
01:36:38,451 --> 01:36:39,231
No one's fight him.

3593
01:36:39,231 --> 01:36:39,820
He's older.

3594
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:40,540
Right champion.

3595
01:36:40,540 --> 01:36:40,850
Right,

3596
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,920
and that guy's a South
Pole fucking nightmare.

3597
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:43,071
Well,

3598
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:45,740
he's a guy that had that fight with
their Russian dude with a Russian dude's

3599
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:49,830
head swolled up and he wound up having
like internal bleeding on his brain.

3600
01:36:50,330 --> 01:36:52,400
Real serious brain injury off that fight,

3601
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,170
which no one will fight.

3602
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:55,100
Ortiz who?

3603
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:55,970
He's very good.

3604
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:59,880
He's a Cuban [inaudible]
name is Joey Diaz.

3605
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:02,770
What is King Kong?

3606
01:37:02,771 --> 01:37:05,600
We're tease is what I like to refer
to him and he's a bad motherfucker.

3607
01:37:06,110 --> 01:37:06,711
Here's our T.

3608
01:37:06,711 --> 01:37:07,890
Looks like Joshua.

3609
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:08,130
Jack,

3610
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,130
he looks like he's out of
Mike Tyson's punch out.

3611
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:11,443
Well he's,

3612
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:12,980
if you watch him fight man,

3613
01:37:12,981 --> 01:37:14,800
he's super skillful south.

3614
01:37:14,801 --> 01:37:17,360
Paul had over 300 400 amateur fights.

3615
01:37:17,361 --> 01:37:17,691
Come on,

3616
01:37:17,691 --> 01:37:18,524
look at that guy.

3617
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:19,641
Okay,

3618
01:37:19,641 --> 01:37:20,474
this counts.

3619
01:37:20,930 --> 01:37:22,100
He's very good man.

3620
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:23,283
Very good.

3621
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:24,590
A powerful Ben.

3622
01:37:24,591 --> 01:37:27,170
He so he was a world
champion as an amateur.

3623
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,030
No one wants to fight
him cause he's older.

3624
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:29,631
He's from Cuba.

3625
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:33,520
They can't really get a read on
him without that Cuban team man.

3626
01:37:33,521 --> 01:37:37,670
That the level of technique that the
Cuban boxing team and the Cuban judo team,

3627
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:38,150
he,

3628
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:41,240
I mean you remember how God damn
good Hector Lombard's judo is.

3629
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,141
People forget that.

3630
01:37:42,141 --> 01:37:44,000
Hector lumbar rag doll.

3631
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:44,870
Jake shields.

3632
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:46,100
Remember that fight?

3633
01:37:46,100 --> 01:37:46,761
That's when I was like,

3634
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:46,851

3635
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:48,490
I'm not going Vegan Egg.

3636
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:48,951
Oh,

3637
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:49,784
how dare you.

3638
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:51,770
You watch that one's a meat eater.

3639
01:37:52,250 --> 01:37:55,580
He hereon eats tags.

3640
01:37:55,860 --> 01:37:55,980
I

3641
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,880
think he's a vegetarian.

3642
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:57,510
Either way.

3643
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,200
I'm not done.

3644
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:02,910
Jake shields is better than ever now and
then has grabbed submitted Leo Machida

3645
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:03,763
son,

3646
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:09,030
he's getting people forget he
beat Damien Maia veteran benefit.

3647
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,310
Most in my experience,

3648
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:11,700
not,

3649
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,990
I dunno if I should say most,

3650
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:17,991
but a lot of MMA fighters as soon as
they hit the UFC just seems like they're

3651
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,850
grappling just maintains you
don't see visible improvements.

3652
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:25,560
Huh?

3653
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,370
Game in mind.

3654
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:27,150
Yes.

3655
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:28,530
That's an exception but people sure.

3656
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,220
But you know whether it's right or wrong,

3657
01:38:30,221 --> 01:38:31,710
like people don't like watching it.

3658
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:34,110
I don't like watching what Maya,

3659
01:38:34,140 --> 01:38:35,880
I mean the the casual fan,

3660
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:37,280
don't they like the knockouts?

3661
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:38,970
They like it all.

3662
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:40,070
Yeah.

3663
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,510
Yeah.

3664
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:44,630
I mean I liked it cause he's so impressive
there but just like the knockouts,

3665
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:45,720
he just wants kickboxing.

3666
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:46,710
We have to any of that shit,

3667
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,150
plenty of that.

3668
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,720
We always had that a boxing stay there.

3669
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,500
I just know sometimes when you
listen to the crowd saying you,

3670
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:57,130
I'm saying no,

3671
01:38:58,970 --> 01:38:59,760
I love it.

3672
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:00,031
No,

3673
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:02,040
but people are on the ground too long.

3674
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:02,370
He's here,

3675
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,660
the crowd booing and stuff.

3676
01:39:03,690 --> 01:39:04,151
You know what I mean?

3677
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:05,310
Like in Alabama?

3678
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:06,983
No,

3679
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:13,940
that's Orange County Shit.

3680
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,070
I got booed like a mother.

3681
01:39:15,230 --> 01:39:18,000
It's like a hundred thousand
Jitsu school down there.

3682
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,990
People appreciate good grappling.

3683
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:22,381
They did.

3684
01:39:22,381 --> 01:39:27,060
The fact that Damien Maia brings that
character and when when you're having him

3685
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:27,781
against anybody,

3686
01:39:27,781 --> 01:39:28,480
any striker,

3687
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:33,120
whoever it is at one 70 are
they going to be able to stop?

3688
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,050
It's a chess match,

3689
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,030
not I get it strangled
like a wild animal gets it.

3690
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:41,460
He was just saying he doesn't
want to see that bullshit.

3691
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:47,010
People want to strangle.

3692
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:48,721
When I shut it,

3693
01:39:48,721 --> 01:39:49,520
who has taught me,

3694
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:49,861
I was like,

3695
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:50,694
fuck

3696
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:54,920
yeah,

3697
01:39:54,920 --> 01:39:56,120
people like both things.

3698
01:39:56,121 --> 01:40:00,050
Now the beautiful thing about MMA
is that all these things can happen.

3699
01:40:00,230 --> 01:40:02,840
Like when were talking about earlier
with Gi guavas and Marvin Kamin,

3700
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:03,411
Tiago.

3701
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:07,880
Elvis was tuning up Martin Kamin and
he someone fucked up in his coach.

3702
01:40:07,881 --> 01:40:08,271
Someone,

3703
01:40:08,271 --> 01:40:10,460
someone apparently according to a belief,

3704
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:11,270
Tiago said,

3705
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:15,230
someone called for a takedown
after he had Martin hurt.

3706
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:18,200
They were like take them down and take
them down and he shot in and Martin has a

3707
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:18,890
nasty,

3708
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,690
it's just locked it up nice and tight.

3709
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:23,930
That's what's the beautiful thing about
MMA is that it could turn on a dime

3710
01:40:24,140 --> 01:40:25,690
because it represents real fighting.

3711
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:26,360
But yeah,

3712
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,510
for the average Yoko knucklehead,

3713
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:30,080
they want to watch dude's throw knuckles,

3714
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:33,470
Cam's right for the general
audience they want to see big knock.

3715
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:36,200
But the thing is it's just
like flip or anything else.

3716
01:40:36,201 --> 01:40:40,920
The deeper you get into the sport more
you appreciate like strategy and craft no

3717
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,210
lives.

3718
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:44,180
And I see him and I listened to you talk
because you talked through the moves

3719
01:40:44,181 --> 01:40:46,280
and when he's on the ground
and you can just see that,

3720
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:48,680
that it just happening.

3721
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,610
I mean it's,

3722
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:50,240
it's awesome.

3723
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:51,650
Well Damien Maia versus Neil,

3724
01:40:51,651 --> 01:40:53,210
Maggie was a great example.

3725
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:55,570
Me Just like B in an awe.

3726
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:56,460
I was like,

3727
01:40:56,460 --> 01:40:58,420
like he like watching his grappling,

3728
01:40:58,630 --> 01:40:58,931
you know,

3729
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:03,340
as someone who was like seeing a lot of
guys fight and a lot of like Jujitsu and

3730
01:41:03,341 --> 01:41:03,761
MMA.

3731
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:06,970
Him and Rick store is another good example
cause I know Rick story is a fucking

3732
01:41:06,971 --> 01:41:08,770
gorilla and he's a really good wrestler.

3733
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:09,301
And the way my,

3734
01:41:09,301 --> 01:41:14,260
I put the clamp down on him and just
slowly squeeze the life out of them like a

3735
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:16,990
fucking Anaconda and got his
back and neck cranked him.

3736
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:18,570
It's like that's pretty drug.

3737
01:41:18,571 --> 01:41:21,720
That's where the commentating
I think is so key to,

3738
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:22,150
you know,

3739
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:24,940
cause you have to be able to explain
what's going on because I don't know,

3740
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:26,380
you also have to like it.

3741
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:32,120
That goes down the knockouts
meeting and Martin is my opinion.

3742
01:41:32,860 --> 01:41:35,170
I think people like MMA show huge now.

3743
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,670
UFC in particular,

3744
01:41:36,671 --> 01:41:38,920
so huge because the knockouts,

3745
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:40,750
unlike in boxing or kickboxing,

3746
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:45,880
the knockouts mean more because that guy
could have fucking dragged you down and

3747
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:46,714
choked you out,

3748
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,650
but you're knocked them out.

3749
01:41:47,651 --> 01:41:48,370
So yeah,

3750
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:49,450
extra special.

3751
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,770
So time sometimes,

3752
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:54,490
but he's other knock is a perfect example.

3753
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:55,324
Why that's not the case.

3754
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:55,710
Me,

3755
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,890
she'd taken Holly Holm.

3756
01:41:57,130 --> 01:41:59,320
It was one of the craziest
fucking fights ever.

3757
01:41:59,321 --> 01:42:00,131
That was a wild,

3758
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:00,910
crazy fight.

3759
01:42:00,910 --> 01:42:05,120
And Meesha take down on points takes
her down in the fifth round and chokes.

3760
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:08,760
No,

3761
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:11,620
that's as dramatic as any knockout
and you don't feel guilty about it.

3762
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:14,740
Of course he don't feel like
you watch someone get brained.

3763
01:42:14,830 --> 01:42:15,240
Yeah.

3764
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:19,450
I think the UFC kind of plays into what
I'm talking about because they show the

3765
01:42:19,451 --> 01:42:20,100
knockouts.

3766
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:20,261
Yeah.

3767
01:42:20,261 --> 01:42:22,540
They don't show a choke
out the highlights.

3768
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:23,640
Yeah.

3769
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:27,850
Cause cause on Fox they don't show
the top 10 submissions to knock out.

3770
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:29,890
If they did,

3771
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:30,850
it would be a hit.

3772
01:42:30,990 --> 01:42:31,280
No,

3773
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:32,410
they could be a fuck.

3774
01:42:32,411 --> 01:42:32,860
Nah.

3775
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:34,660
Not as big as I thought.

3776
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:35,950
I love juice to mourn striking.

3777
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:40,660
Not as big as the hit us
knocked out just as big boys.

3778
01:42:40,661 --> 01:42:43,740
We are about to see the best submissions.

3779
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,520
You wouldn't get to it,

3780
01:42:45,521 --> 01:42:46,271
but in general,

3781
01:42:46,271 --> 01:42:47,200
people in Snow White,

3782
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:50,080
this is a real possibility in this fight.

3783
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:52,030
Let's take this and to consider
snow grappling going on.

3784
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:52,940
You know?

3785
01:42:52,940 --> 01:42:53,320
No,

3786
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:54,153
you don't know.

3787
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:58,090
Michael Bisping might try and take
Dan Henderson down thinking that Dan

3788
01:42:58,090 --> 01:42:59,120
Henderson maybe gets tired,

3789
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,490
took him down and he's older.

3790
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:03,070
Who knows what's going to happen here.

3791
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,430
I think Bisbing boxes.

3792
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:07,630
This is going to be crazy.

3793
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:09,010
It's going on right now.

3794
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,860
He just has to avoid that
giant fucking h bomb.

3795
01:43:11,980 --> 01:43:12,813
Yeah,

3796
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:16,980
just circle to do it with
one eye and go get that touch

3797
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:19,533
to the back of the head.

3798
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,760
How do they let 'em fight
with one arm in the elbow?

3799
01:43:21,850 --> 01:43:22,031
Well,

3800
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:22,930
he can see enough.

3801
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,101
He could see enough.

3802
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:25,810
Apparently all that stuff does.

3803
01:43:25,811 --> 01:43:29,500
It's not like his vision is
devastated to the point of no repair.

3804
01:43:29,770 --> 01:43:32,530
It's like he needs that in there
to keep it as retina intact.

3805
01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:35,850
Only he knows and his doctors
how well he could see from what,

3806
01:43:35,851 --> 01:43:36,730
but it ain't perfect.

3807
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:38,460
How good does Dan look physically?

3808
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:38,661
Yeah,

3809
01:43:38,661 --> 01:43:39,494
it looks great.

3810
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:40,211
Powerful.

3811
01:43:40,211 --> 01:43:41,044
10 too.

3812
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:41,751
He brought an art,

3813
01:43:41,751 --> 01:43:42,790
some leaven for this camp.

3814
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,001
Oh,

3815
01:43:43,001 --> 01:43:43,450
duty.

3816
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:43,750
Yeah.

3817
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:44,583
Damn.

3818
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:44,831
Yeah.

3819
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:49,480
A lot of pictures of him sparring with
arts 11 on Instagram 11 who's a former

3820
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:51,970
world muy Thai champion Joe Forum,

3821
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,450
like Super High Level Guy.

3822
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:56,210
He was a glory champ.

3823
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:56,781
Oh,

3824
01:43:56,781 --> 01:44:00,040
switch kick by perilla cause
Bisping's coach said he,

3825
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:02,450
he thinks business wins
by left high kick dude.

3826
01:44:02,451 --> 01:44:02,991
He just switched,

3827
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:04,270
kicked him up behind.

3828
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,660
It looks smooth as fuck did he?

3829
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:06,321
I didn't see that.

3830
01:44:06,321 --> 01:44:07,670
It doesn't mean he blocked it,

3831
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:09,050
but it looks smooth as fuck.

3832
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,110
Bisping's fight.

3833
01:44:10,110 --> 01:44:10,830
Nice.

3834
01:44:10,830 --> 01:44:13,370
I don't get why more people don't
talk about is his striking coach.

3835
01:44:13,371 --> 01:44:13,581
It's,

3836
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,250
it's cyborg striking coach and lesbians.

3837
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:19,290
Two monsters will and Bj Penn,

3838
01:44:19,291 --> 01:44:21,250
he worked with PJ Penn chasen pearls.

3839
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,300
A bad motherfucker out of the fight,

3840
01:44:23,301 --> 01:44:23,720
Huh?

3841
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:24,351
Yes he is.

3842
01:44:24,351 --> 01:44:27,330
And he canceled the entire card
because of the God dog to the

3843
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:30,410
Bj got injured apparently.

3844
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:30,860
Damn.

3845
01:44:30,860 --> 01:44:31,880
I don't know what the injury is.

3846
01:44:31,881 --> 01:44:33,620
Let me some Bj Penn love him.

3847
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:34,910
But you know what man,

3848
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:38,000
that was a crazy way to
jump back into the pool.

3849
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:38,930
Get barreled,

3850
01:44:38,930 --> 01:44:41,060
says I get him F's favorable.

3851
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:41,340
We,

3852
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:41,600
you know,

3853
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,290
we don't know.

3854
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:45,050
He looked terrible and his last fight
I thought when he fought Frankie Edgar.

3855
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:45,520
Yeah.

3856
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:48,290
You've got to realize is
also fighting a monster.

3857
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,431
Yeah.

3858
01:44:48,431 --> 01:44:49,960
But we never seen him like this dad.

3859
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:50,151
No,

3860
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:52,530
we have the hype was the hall staff,

3861
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,960
but that was also camp in Hawaii and
since then he trained at Greg Jackson's

3862
01:44:56,961 --> 01:44:58,160
music in there for a long time.

3863
01:44:58,161 --> 01:45:01,160
Now that right to handle
landed a right hand.

3864
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:06,260
Pa Did do this one's only that
thing lands plus this bitch is over.

3865
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:08,540
You've got a 46 year old world champion.

3866
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:09,240
Yeah.

3867
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:10,130
If it lands,

3868
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:10,971
if it lands,

3869
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,800
it landed once on everybody.

3870
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:13,190
Right.

3871
01:45:13,190 --> 01:45:14,570
I mean nobody can take that.

3872
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:15,981
Cain Velasquez,

3873
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:18,270
we got knocked out bolt right
and he's left hook to man.

3874
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:18,620
She know.

3875
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:19,020
Busy.

3876
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:20,870
Just thinking about that right now.

3877
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:21,591
Yes he is,

3878
01:45:21,591 --> 01:45:22,460
but it doesn't matter.

3879
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:23,720
So it was Hector Lombard.

3880
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,670
The thing about Dan Henderson is he,

3881
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:31,370
he's got that one touch thing going on
where he can just connect out of nowhere.

3882
01:45:31,371 --> 01:45:32,100
Like with Lumbar,

3883
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,040
he hits him in the back
elbow and puts them asleep.

3884
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:36,550
Who the fuck does that heard?

3885
01:45:36,740 --> 01:45:39,110
That's a bar room to take a
picture with Dan Henderson.

3886
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:40,010
Put your hand on his back.

3887
01:45:40,011 --> 01:45:43,100
It's like you're holding one of those
Indian Indian statues that has cigars.

3888
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:43,730
Yeah.

3889
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:46,010
It's like all raw
touches made out of wood.

3890
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:46,670
Pure would.

3891
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:48,260
He does like Ryan Parsons,

3892
01:45:48,261 --> 01:45:50,420
who was his manager and his
trainer for a long time.

3893
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,370
Ryan Parsons used to do massage on him.

3894
01:45:52,371 --> 01:45:52,880
Like he had deep,

3895
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,600
deep tissue on it.

3896
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:53,930
He said,

3897
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:54,171
dude,

3898
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:55,520
I'd be fucking exhausted.

3899
01:45:55,940 --> 01:45:56,301
He said,

3900
01:45:56,301 --> 01:45:57,134
I've never,

3901
01:45:57,230 --> 01:46:00,710
I've never massaged anybody or
you know Ryan's chiropractor too,

3902
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,050
cause I'd never manipulate
anybody who's is dense,

3903
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:03,920
Dan.

3904
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,753
Is that,

3905
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:05,780
is their blood coming?

3906
01:46:05,781 --> 01:46:07,370
So there's blood on top of his head.

3907
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:08,263
There is.

3908
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,880
That was from the first one purse left.

3909
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:11,541
Where's the blood?

3910
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:12,080
You know,

3911
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,120
it looks like some of
the top of his hairline.

3912
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:14,993
Yeah.

3913
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,550
There's an lag from a headbutt.

3914
01:46:16,610 --> 01:46:16,911
No.

3915
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:17,810
Is that left jab?

3916
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:18,090
I think.

3917
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,940
Well the good news is
you already can't see.

3918
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:21,440
So it's probably not
bothering them at all.

3919
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:22,550
As long as doesn't go in the other eye,

3920
01:46:22,551 --> 01:46:23,480
then he's blind.

3921
01:46:23,481 --> 01:46:23,840
Yeah.

3922
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:24,740
It doesn't give a fuck.

3923
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:24,951
No,

3924
01:46:24,951 --> 01:46:25,490
he doesn't.

3925
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:26,990
Who was more game than Michael Bisping?

3926
01:46:27,210 --> 01:46:28,160
He never met a guy.

3927
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:28,980
And let me ask you this,

3928
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,390
has any guy benefited more
than the TRT movement then?

3929
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:33,233
Bisping.

3930
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:34,430
He's one of them.

3931
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:35,600
He's world champ.

3932
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:36,050
Well,

3933
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:37,040
so was mighty mouse.

3934
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:38,300
Why do you mouse?

3935
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:39,590
But he never suffered from it.

3936
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:42,650
I'm saying busily bath routine
off fought him on that shit.

3937
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:44,400
He filed an EPO and he still beat them.

3938
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:44,600
Yeah.

3939
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:44,990
Yeah,

3940
01:46:44,990 --> 01:46:45,350
but I,

3941
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:46,031
but I'm saying he,

3942
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:48,320
he's never had any issues with it beings.

3943
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:50,190
Flat guys lost the only guys

3944
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:51,450
who have been TRT guys.

3945
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:51,840
Right.

3946
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:52,410
You're right.

3947
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:54,630
And took him 10 years to
get his fucking title shot.

3948
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:59,540
Then he gets it on what an eight day
knows and beats Lula Rockhold cold stuff.

3949
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:00,090
Fuck.

3950
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:01,680
By kicking out root for that guy.

3951
01:47:01,710 --> 01:47:03,090
I know what he talking about.

3952
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:06,180
He's his game as they come in and
he's been in the business for forever.

3953
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,650
Remember he won ultimate fighter,

3954
01:47:07,651 --> 01:47:07,951
right?

3955
01:47:07,951 --> 01:47:08,431
You see that right?

3956
01:47:08,431 --> 01:47:08,840
Again,

3957
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:09,050
what?

3958
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,431
What'd he win?

3959
01:47:09,431 --> 01:47:11,490
Season two season two or three,

3960
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:11,930
right.

3961
01:47:11,930 --> 01:47:12,900
Whatever Tate was on.

3962
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:13,530
Oh,

3963
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:13,761
switch.

3964
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:15,000
Kick to the body is nice.

3965
01:47:15,300 --> 01:47:15,810
He's switched.

3966
01:47:15,810 --> 01:47:16,650
Kick is beautiful.

3967
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:17,940
Oh God.

3968
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:18,833
You know was,

3969
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:20,701
yeah,

3970
01:47:20,701 --> 01:47:22,890
but almost as a really important point.

3971
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:25,260
Like we're sliding just out of the way.

3972
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:27,720
I know that timing,

3973
01:47:27,970 --> 01:47:28,803
that timing.

3974
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:29,371
Hey,

3975
01:47:29,371 --> 01:47:31,440
doesn't that timing kind of happens?

3976
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:33,570
But you see the way the distance between,

3977
01:47:33,571 --> 01:47:33,991
I mean look,

3978
01:47:33,991 --> 01:47:34,980
it can totally land.

3979
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:35,700
Don't get me wrong,

3980
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:40,140
but the way it's missing
[inaudible] fuck you.

3981
01:47:40,410 --> 01:47:41,243
Tell me

3982
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,130
what the hell's going on.

3983
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,780
He's 46 years old.

3984
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:46,990
Why are these going?

3985
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:47,823
Whoa.

3986
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:52,820
Oh Man.

3987
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:54,440
Bisbing is fucking stride.

3988
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:56,783
Grapple.

3989
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:57,683
Oh God.

3990
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:00,180
He say it in there with being,

3991
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:01,820
Oh shit.

3992
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:05,420
She said,

3993
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:05,880
come on.

3994
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:06,713
Come on.

3995
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:07,970
Oh,

3996
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:08,820
Holy Shit.

3997
01:48:08,821 --> 01:48:10,090
This is a fucking war.

3998
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:14,880
Why rest?

3999
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,520
Here's another thing about God.

4000
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,450
Nothing about Bisping.

4001
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:18,960
People underestimate resting.

4002
01:48:18,970 --> 01:48:21,210
Heartbeat's 34 beats per minute.

4003
01:48:21,211 --> 01:48:21,960
This cut.

4004
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,920
It's crazy dude.

4005
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:24,810
Right?

4006
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:26,040
Fricking merch dem.

4007
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,280
It's a crazy fucking high sign.

4008
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:30,313
How about Dennis?

4009
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:31,500
Kick off Kim.

4010
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:32,413
Avoid date.

4011
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,860
Circle right from that fucking right hand.

4012
01:48:34,861 --> 01:48:36,100
The right first rason.

4013
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:37,013
This is not good match.

4014
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:37,891
It's not that bad.

4015
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:38,724
It's not.

4016
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:39,360
No.

4017
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:39,841
Here's the thing.

4018
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:40,890
It's below the eye.

4019
01:48:41,010 --> 01:48:43,380
Whatever's happening up
top is in the forehead,

4020
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:45,870
which bleeds a lot but not that bad.

4021
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:46,620
Hey,

4022
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:47,580
that's his good eye.

4023
01:48:47,581 --> 01:48:48,540
Isn't that going to swell?

4024
01:48:48,541 --> 01:48:48,960
Shut?

4025
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:49,590
It could,

4026
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:51,150
but here's the thing.

4027
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,140
They're working on the cut.

4028
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:53,003
The real problem.

4029
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:58,490
The one thing you don't
want to happen almost.

4030
01:48:58,510 --> 01:48:59,370
This is a good point

4031
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:02,380
and that was not almost

4032
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,000
exact same thing.

4033
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,560
Dodged a bullet.

4034
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,590
Crazy pressure bisman is under right now.

4035
01:49:14,591 --> 01:49:17,400
If I feel for the guy and
I don't want him to lose,

4036
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:18,751
here's the thing,

4037
01:49:18,751 --> 01:49:19,140
man,

4038
01:49:19,140 --> 01:49:22,850
that fucking Dan can definitely
still knock them out 100% right?

4039
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,060
He knock anybody out.

4040
01:49:24,061 --> 01:49:24,894
We said that before,

4041
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:27,030
but it's being survived.

4042
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:27,580
You know,

4043
01:49:27,580 --> 01:49:30,070
just the fact that he's able to
survive this goddamn gigantic.

4044
01:49:30,071 --> 01:49:32,230
It's gonna mess up your cardio
two a little bit though,

4045
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:32,930
if you're busy.

4046
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:33,400
Mine,

4047
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:34,500
but Bisping again.

4048
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:34,600
Oh,

4049
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,910
I'm worried about is ridiculous.

4050
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:36,420
Cardio.

4051
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,950
Remember is Anderson Silva fight?

4052
01:49:37,951 --> 01:49:39,080
He was basically out in that tune,

4053
01:49:39,090 --> 01:49:39,923
came back.

4054
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:41,311
He was out,

4055
01:49:41,311 --> 01:49:41,590
out,

4056
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:42,180
out,

4057
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:44,370
flying flat face and Anderson.

4058
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:48,400
You've walked away from it like it was
like it was a walkaway and the referee

4059
01:49:48,401 --> 01:49:49,320
kept the fight going down.

4060
01:49:49,330 --> 01:49:50,750
Her Dean said no big deal to herb.

4061
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,191
He was like,

4062
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:51,431
look,

4063
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:52,450
I'll tell you when it's done.

4064
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,990
My job is ref re,

4065
01:49:59,170 --> 01:49:59,291
hey,

4066
01:49:59,291 --> 01:49:59,711
wake up.

4067
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:00,760
Make get your bitch ass up.

4068
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:01,930
Y'All shit.

4069
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:02,950
Look at this.

4070
01:50:04,240 --> 01:50:05,500
Oh my goodness.

4071
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:08,020
Come on Michael.

4072
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,200
He just has to land that one.

4073
01:50:10,690 --> 01:50:11,430
Goddammit.

4074
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:11,800
Come on,

4075
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,310
bids being,

4076
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:13,570
oh look at that inside leg kick.

4077
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:14,860
He and that was beautiful technique.

4078
01:50:14,861 --> 01:50:15,760
Fake the right hand.

4079
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:17,110
Now he went high with it.

4080
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:17,973
Holy Shit.

4081
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:20,620
No,

4082
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:22,760
he really doesn't give a
fuck about any of that.

4083
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:24,970
He's just ready to fire this h bomb.

4084
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:26,200
That all still sucks.

4085
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:28,570
I liked the way Bisping's moving.

4086
01:50:28,571 --> 01:50:30,070
It doesn't mean that Dan can't land it,

4087
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:31,023
but here's the thing.

4088
01:50:31,310 --> 01:50:32,580
Well you brought up camps,

4089
01:50:32,581 --> 01:50:35,980
super important that left eyes
swelling hardcore right now.

4090
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,223
I wouldn't mind a tip.

4091
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:40,063
He does.

4092
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:41,140
He,

4093
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:42,390
he doesn't look hurt at all.

4094
01:50:42,391 --> 01:50:43,420
It just needs to get a little,

4095
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:47,530
I just need to get a sweat on
maybe gas during that flourish.

4096
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,183
Maybe I'd have.

4097
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,610
He was going for the knockout.

4098
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:52,590
It doesn't have any energy.

4099
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:54,340
It's not a volume.

4100
01:50:54,341 --> 01:50:55,920
Punches him in the knee.

4101
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:56,151
Yeah,

4102
01:50:56,151 --> 01:50:57,880
I just punched him in and
he's not a volume puncher.

4103
01:50:57,881 --> 01:51:01,270
He might just be waiting to
land that fucking nuclear bomb.

4104
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:01,421
Yeah,

4105
01:51:01,421 --> 01:51:01,841
but look,

4106
01:51:01,841 --> 01:51:03,970
he keeps getting hit with
that switch kick to the arms.

4107
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,040
That shit takes a lot of,

4108
01:51:05,041 --> 01:51:05,500
I don't even know.

4109
01:51:05,500 --> 01:51:06,333
Does

4110
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,150
Michael Bisping looking for the
power right hand over the top.

4111
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:10,991
You know what the scary thing?

4112
01:51:10,991 --> 01:51:11,380
That's fine.

4113
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,990
He's cause Bisbing that they play that
highlight him getting knocked out,

4114
01:51:13,991 --> 01:51:14,171
right?

4115
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:16,030
It's Dan Hill Shins fucking logo.

4116
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:17,110
So going into the fight,

4117
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:18,940
I'm assuming he wants that revenge.

4118
01:51:18,941 --> 01:51:19,810
Try and knock them out.

4119
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:20,803
I think

4120
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:23,530
it's kind of a slap that didn't land.

4121
01:51:23,531 --> 01:51:24,364
Yeah,

4122
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:25,750
you guys are both blind.

4123
01:51:26,250 --> 01:51:27,083
I don't give a fuck.

4124
01:51:27,410 --> 01:51:28,280
13 vision.

4125
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:34,440
10 1510 15 oh inside.

4126
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:35,823
Oh

4127
01:51:38,020 --> 01:51:38,261
Dude,

4128
01:51:38,261 --> 01:51:39,160
if he pulls this off,

4129
01:51:39,161 --> 01:51:40,330
this is the craziest,

4130
01:51:40,331 --> 01:51:42,250
you know I find ever.

4131
01:51:45,650 --> 01:51:46,483
Goodness.

4132
01:51:49,150 --> 01:51:50,800
That's an old possum too.

4133
01:51:50,801 --> 01:51:52,710
He's seen this before was like a bus crap.

4134
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:54,820
What's scary than a possum?

4135
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,630
Nothing.

4136
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:56,171
Badger.

4137
01:51:56,171 --> 01:51:57,190
He's more of a pageant.

4138
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,440
The honeybadger.

4139
01:51:58,910 --> 01:52:01,120
How'd he bagger God?

4140
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:02,040
Be careful down.

4141
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,430
Oh Shit.

4142
01:52:03,431 --> 01:52:04,211
That left high kicks.

4143
01:52:04,211 --> 01:52:04,841
A big factor.

4144
01:52:04,841 --> 01:52:05,850
That's why they were talking about it,

4145
01:52:05,860 --> 01:52:06,150
Huh?

4146
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:06,401
Yeah.

4147
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:07,930
This thing is a beautiful left high kick

4148
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:10,750
looking for the right hand.

4149
01:52:10,751 --> 01:52:12,490
Bisbee is looking to catch
him with a right hand.

4150
01:52:12,730 --> 01:52:15,430
They've got to get that end swell on
the fucking I in between the rounds.

4151
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:16,743
Oh,

4152
01:52:17,470 --> 01:52:20,590
spent some time in Thailand for
this camp to see that video.

4153
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,000
I fuck you're just kicking.

4154
01:52:22,001 --> 01:52:22,360
I looked,

4155
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,193
yeah,

4156
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:24,713
every fight.

4157
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:27,490
He's the champ too.

4158
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:31,180
You have to respect the fact that him
winning the champ did championship.

4159
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:33,660
Must have had an extreme
effect as confidence.

4160
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:34,030
Yeah.

4161
01:52:34,030 --> 01:52:34,271
He's,

4162
01:52:34,271 --> 01:52:36,520
and he's a guy that's
never lacked confidence.

4163
01:52:37,220 --> 01:52:38,053
He gets to bed.

4164
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:38,501
He's like,

4165
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:39,334
Oh shit.

4166
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,700
I told you I was fucking right.

4167
01:52:41,710 --> 01:52:45,860
Told you all fruit pastels for
everybody got big balls in the UK.

4168
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:46,773
Yeah,

4169
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,153
yeah.

4170
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:52,190
Carter's considered UK in Ireland.

4171
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:53,053
Yeah.

4172
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,291
Ooh,

4173
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:55,400
look at that knee of the body.

4174
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:58,910
People now they don't even
know what the fucking UK is.

4175
01:53:00,490 --> 01:53:01,460
Shut it off.

4176
01:53:02,060 --> 01:53:03,520
Oh,

4177
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:07,760
he say low.

4178
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:08,061
He's like,

4179
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:08,450
fuck.

4180
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,440
Oh God.

4181
01:53:09,441 --> 01:53:10,274
Be careful now.

4182
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:11,350
Hateful combination.

4183
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:12,693
You Levine.

4184
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,760
Oh,

4185
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,153
oh.

4186
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:19,433
Oh.

4187
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:26,030
He's covering his mouth

4188
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:29,783
wrong.

4189
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:31,600
It's so wrong.

4190
01:53:34,060 --> 01:53:35,810
I'm free so we can cover his mouth again.

4191
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:38,710
That is some old man.

4192
01:53:39,770 --> 01:53:42,030
He's going to break that
clench and he's going to rise

4193
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:44,000
this.

4194
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:44,833
Let me ask you this,

4195
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:46,053
this,

4196
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:46,973
this round too.

4197
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:47,991
I was thinking,

4198
01:53:47,991 --> 01:53:50,270
who the fuck to rep
Bisping's tuning them up.

4199
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,380
Bisbing how about this?

4200
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:52,300
You got to go.

4201
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:53,030
Listen man.

4202
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:55,010
He thought he thought he had it,

4203
01:53:55,011 --> 01:53:55,311
man.

4204
01:53:55,311 --> 01:53:56,210
He thought he had it.

4205
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,470
He was turning it on.

4206
01:53:57,471 --> 01:53:58,580
If I was going to win by knockout,

4207
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:02,090
he's so confident and Henderson
just drops the fucking,

4208
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,600
how about keep that left?

4209
01:54:05,601 --> 01:54:06,240
Don't look at that.

4210
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:09,530
Is tying them up pretty good coming back.

4211
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:11,600
It's going to be,

4212
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:13,180
he's going to rise up and

4213
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:16,910
it's in England,

4214
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:17,763
so may help.

4215
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:19,400
It'd be tough to get busy in that round.

4216
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:20,001
Boy,

4217
01:54:20,001 --> 01:54:25,001
that's a weird round man because for sure
Henderson had one spectacular moment.

4218
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:26,330
Hey,

4219
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:30,680
for sure before that first three to
give that to Henderson first three and a

4220
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:31,820
half minutes as Biz being,

4221
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:33,230
you look at the round and said,

4222
01:54:33,231 --> 01:54:34,300
who won that round to

4223
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:37,251
put them away.

4224
01:54:37,251 --> 01:54:38,084
Here's the thing.

4225
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:38,900
Look at this.

4226
01:54:38,900 --> 01:54:39,733
Boom.

4227
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:41,900
He tuned Henderson.

4228
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:44,403
It was,

4229
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,720
oh my God and Bisping's like what?

4230
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:52,310
Notice the eave Levine.

4231
01:54:52,311 --> 01:54:53,630
We'll let you get yo ass

4232
01:54:58,840 --> 01:55:00,490
evil Levine.

4233
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,290
Look at that.

4234
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,730
He's asking question.

4235
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,420
What happened?

4236
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:06,231
God Damn it.

4237
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:06,780
Come on please.

4238
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:08,150
It's been fuck man.

4239
01:55:09,260 --> 01:55:10,760
While he's getting well,

4240
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:11,900
see they're working on the cut,

4241
01:55:11,901 --> 01:55:13,160
but there's all that swelling.

4242
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:13,760
I don't see them.

4243
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:14,151
I don't know.

4244
01:55:14,151 --> 01:55:14,511
Maybe,

4245
01:55:14,511 --> 01:55:15,890
maybe they weren't where
we weren't looking at it,

4246
01:55:15,891 --> 01:55:18,260
but I would like to see
them have that metal piece,

4247
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:21,530
put that shit on and at the end when
you know there's 10 seconds left,

4248
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:24,530
then you put that shit on
that cut and fill it up.

4249
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,480
But the most important
things that he can see,

4250
01:55:26,481 --> 01:55:30,200
the crowd is not going to affect his
vision because he drives out twice with

4251
01:55:30,201 --> 01:55:31,050
that harm.

4252
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:33,200
How good is Bisbing Chin though?

4253
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:35,270
I know it's hard,

4254
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:40,310
but you gotta realize that Bisbing part
of that flurry was him kicking Henderson

4255
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:40,851
and the Dick.

4256
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:42,290
Now that we know that for sure.

4257
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,930
Oh,

4258
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,250
I left high kick again

4259
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:48,480
to keep coming because it's
like a fucking bear trap.

4260
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,510
So do you give the first
two rounds to Henderson?

4261
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:52,381
I would,

4262
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:52,650
yeah,

4263
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:53,460
I do.

4264
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:58,050
I don't know the kick to the deck now
that I know it was a kick to the Dick.

4265
01:55:58,110 --> 01:55:58,910
That's what I'm saying.

4266
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,290
I might say.

4267
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:03,690
I might say it's an even round or you
might be able to give it to Bisping.

4268
01:56:04,110 --> 01:56:04,760
No,

4269
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:05,541
I don't know.

4270
01:56:05,541 --> 01:56:06,030
I don't know.

4271
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:06,960
How would they kicked him out?

4272
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:08,290
Didn't sway you more towards him.

4273
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:12,450
He almost finished it in the
second round and the first round,

4274
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:15,050
the truth around when he always left son.

4275
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:15,661
It's true.

4276
01:56:15,661 --> 01:56:16,530
The almost finished him.

4277
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:16,741
No,

4278
01:56:16,741 --> 01:56:17,580
you got a good point.

4279
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:17,791
I mean,

4280
01:56:17,791 --> 01:56:18,900
I'm just making an argument,

4281
01:56:18,980 --> 01:56:19,813
but what do we,

4282
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:20,700
what are we judging?

4283
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:24,280
You know there's two rounds kicks to the
knee first two rather than going like

4284
01:56:24,281 --> 01:56:25,920
Ha Henderson could almost a finished him.

4285
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,341
Yup,

4286
01:56:26,341 --> 01:56:26,790
correct.

4287
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:29,370
But it looked like Bisping was
coming on strong in the second round,

4288
01:56:29,371 --> 01:56:30,870
but now we know as a kick to the deck,

4289
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:32,400
it had a big factor in there.

4290
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:33,490
Think about if you're a judge,

4291
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:34,081
you're thinking,

4292
01:56:34,081 --> 01:56:34,351
God,

4293
01:56:34,351 --> 01:56:36,510
who did the most damage
and the most shots.

4294
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:37,820
If you look at the strike stats,

4295
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,930
I guarantee you Bisping's
landed way more shot.

4296
01:56:40,240 --> 01:56:40,770
You don't care.

4297
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:41,430
Well,

4298
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:42,450
they don't care about that.

4299
01:56:42,451 --> 01:56:46,680
Usually look at Dotson
Linacre but the actual volume,

4300
01:56:46,710 --> 01:56:47,011
you know,

4301
01:56:47,011 --> 01:56:48,960
I'm embarrassed to say I
have not seen that fight.

4302
01:56:49,050 --> 01:56:49,521
I'll dare you,

4303
01:56:49,521 --> 01:56:49,860
sir.

4304
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:50,690
I'm embarrassed.

4305
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:50,840
Well,

4306
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:51,990
you've been killing elk,

4307
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:53,010
so I'll give you out there.

4308
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:55,710
I got to get a year's
worth of meat in one shot.

4309
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:56,091
That's,

4310
01:56:56,091 --> 01:56:56,924
that's fair.

4311
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:58,440
It's more fighting for his family.

4312
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,760
I don't have a grill.

4313
01:56:59,820 --> 01:57:01,440
How dare I wish you
would make some of the,

4314
01:57:01,450 --> 01:57:06,450
and I know you American grown on
the guys talking about grill big.

4315
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:09,870
It looks very good.

4316
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:10,800
Look at that Jab.

4317
01:57:11,370 --> 01:57:12,480
Here's the thing about Bisping,

4318
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:12,811
man.

4319
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:15,360
He's looking at fluid and smooth,

4320
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:19,110
even in the face of dire
danger and he's looking bloody,

4321
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:20,640
but he's not changing his game plan.

4322
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:24,630
Like he's doing fucking
win by knockout man.

4323
01:57:24,740 --> 01:57:26,950
He wants it to bad cell phones.

4324
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:30,240
So far he's been able to survive like,

4325
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:32,070
I mean he's got to go after him.

4326
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:32,870
He's got out,

4327
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:34,290
he wants to where Dan out.

4328
01:57:34,291 --> 01:57:35,100
And right now we're,

4329
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:36,330
we're headed into the third,

4330
01:57:36,331 --> 01:57:36,780
right?

4331
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:39,390
So we got two 15 the third,

4332
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,000
we got two more rounds after this.

4333
01:57:42,001 --> 01:57:42,960
This is crazy.

4334
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:43,620
Oh,

4335
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,610
Beautiful Jab.

4336
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:45,990
Dan does look a little bit,

4337
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,953
it looks a little time.

4338
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,790
I've got the power he could throw out

4339
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:51,720
too,

4340
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,800
but it was a beautiful face,

4341
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,770
beautiful thing to a leg kick
and he showed it to him again.

4342
01:57:55,771 --> 01:57:57,180
Now he taxed with the inside.

4343
01:57:57,180 --> 01:57:59,520
I think Brisbane to win has to
win these next three rounds.

4344
01:57:59,521 --> 01:58:00,060
Dan.

4345
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:01,770
Dan Isn't can lose one of these rounds.

4346
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,011
Yeah.

4347
01:58:02,011 --> 01:58:04,110
Bisbee he's gotta be careful
with that thing that he's doing.

4348
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:05,940
He's doing this switch to the high kick,

4349
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:06,511
but he's doing it.

4350
01:58:06,511 --> 01:58:08,270
He's dropping that left
hand and a big way.

4351
01:58:08,271 --> 01:58:08,360
I,

4352
01:58:08,360 --> 01:58:08,541
yeah,

4353
01:58:08,541 --> 01:58:12,540
it keeps doing it and pull him biff
Henderson Times that that switched to the

4354
01:58:12,541 --> 01:58:13,021
high kick.

4355
01:58:13,021 --> 01:58:13,920
If he's got it in them,

4356
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:15,750
it's a matter of whether
he's got it in a tank,

4357
01:58:15,930 --> 01:58:18,870
but he throws that step
in looping right hand.

4358
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:21,060
If he can time that
switch to the high kick.

4359
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:22,890
Bisbing can't get out of the way.

4360
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:24,150
Once that legs and play,

4361
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:26,580
he's all the way his legs up
in the air and he's throwing,

4362
01:58:26,581 --> 01:58:27,960
especially when you're going high,

4363
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:31,470
there's very little head moving
is very little that you have left.

4364
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,510
He's also timing his jab when he comes in,

4365
01:58:33,511 --> 01:58:37,740
that's all day and coming over the top
Henderson's from like three punches.

4366
01:58:37,741 --> 01:58:38,574
This round,

4367
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:40,740
that punch.

4368
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:42,010
That's

4369
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,843
all it.

4370
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:43,631
Well,

4371
01:58:43,631 --> 01:58:44,650
I don't think he's capable.

4372
01:58:44,690 --> 01:58:46,270
Our tank is the power tank.

4373
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:47,350
Just refueling.

4374
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:49,830
I'll think he's capable
of making those all.

4375
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,490
He made the fake to the a new tab.

4376
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:53,920
I don't think he's
capable of making those,

4377
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:56,200
those rounds the way Bisping's fighting.

4378
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:57,063
No,

4379
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:58,400
he just,

4380
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,280
he's just refueling that battery.

4381
01:59:00,460 --> 01:59:00,671
Yeah.

4382
01:59:00,671 --> 01:59:01,810
He's like a video game.

4383
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:02,644
He's just,

4384
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:03,513
yeah.

4385
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,583
Video game.

4386
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,371
Is this right?

4387
01:59:06,371 --> 01:59:07,840
And actually known as the h bomb.

4388
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:08,390
Yeah.

4389
01:59:08,390 --> 01:59:09,223
Yeah.

4390
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:10,890
I think that's more,

4391
01:59:10,960 --> 01:59:12,520
we're now named it.

4392
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,310
It looks like Dan slipped.

4393
01:59:18,311 --> 01:59:19,144
He landed.

4394
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:20,643
Yeah.

4395
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:21,971
God,

4396
01:59:21,971 --> 01:59:22,804
that's dangerous.

4397
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:24,080
Definitely busy thing.

4398
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:28,060
No matter what happens
in the US and UK history,

4399
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:30,460
this forth for Horry.

4400
01:59:30,461 --> 01:59:31,110
Right.

4401
01:59:31,110 --> 01:59:31,451
Come on.

4402
01:59:31,451 --> 01:59:34,060
This did look at this number
bigger and better than the UK.

4403
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:37,060
The first round Henderson landed more
because he has this thing dealing trouble

4404
01:59:37,270 --> 01:59:39,760
like no one thinks that
Bisping win the first round,

4405
01:59:39,761 --> 01:59:39,980
right?

4406
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:40,813
Impossible.

4407
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,781
First round,

4408
01:59:41,781 --> 01:59:44,160
a hundred percent Henderson second
round because they paid him off.

4409
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:45,040
He looked great.

4410
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,060
He looked great for a while,

4411
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:48,550
but he got knocked down and almost
finished at the end of the round.

4412
01:59:48,660 --> 01:59:50,830
At the end of the rug got taken over.

4413
01:59:50,831 --> 01:59:51,664
There's a difference.

4414
01:59:52,070 --> 01:59:52,950
Third round.

4415
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,853
The third round.

4416
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:55,270
Yes.

4417
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:56,103
He's still got,

4418
01:59:56,120 --> 01:59:57,250
he's got to do is throw one.

4419
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:57,890
You're right.

4420
01:59:57,890 --> 01:59:58,670
You're right.

4421
01:59:58,670 --> 01:59:59,503
You're right.

4422
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:02,890
None of this means daily hired two in
business because it makes it a better

4423
02:00:02,891 --> 02:00:03,310
fight.

4424
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:04,180
It's like a title.

4425
02:00:04,181 --> 02:00:06,040
It's bomb is right fucking there.

4426
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,000
Look right there.

4427
02:00:08,050 --> 02:00:08,883
You never know.

4428
02:00:08,930 --> 02:00:10,930
Now powerful stiff kick by Dan.

4429
02:00:11,860 --> 02:00:12,730
Look for the high kicks.

4430
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:19,150
Bisbee but now I see what they want
the left cause mom's coming down.

4431
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:21,670
He smiled and he knows it.

4432
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:22,690
Yeah.

4433
02:00:22,690 --> 02:00:23,560
As long as he's standing,

4434
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:25,600
no matter how wobbly he is,

4435
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:28,390
remember fate or his
fucking him up and then uh,

4436
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:29,171
yeah,

4437
02:00:29,171 --> 02:00:30,004
then he

4438
02:00:31,830 --> 02:00:32,080
hit him.

4439
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:34,900
Recite fader was winning.

4440
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:38,110
He went up to dog fight control.

4441
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,400
He didn't have the wizard.

4442
02:00:39,401 --> 02:00:40,061
He kept punching.

4443
02:00:40,061 --> 02:00:42,290
So he had his back and then

4444
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:47,020
turned around quick install
because of that wizard.

4445
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:47,980
Yup.

4446
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:50,260
All because of a lack of wisdom.

4447
02:00:50,290 --> 02:00:51,280
Deep half guard.

4448
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:51,890
Yeah.

4449
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:55,930
The lack of wisdom inside control with
the under hook blasted up the dog fight

4450
02:00:55,931 --> 02:00:56,830
from side control.

4451
02:00:56,890 --> 02:00:57,520
Boom.

4452
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,810
They don't kept throwing punches
when he should throw the wizard,

4453
02:00:59,811 --> 02:01:00,760
the wizard and back down.

4454
02:01:00,761 --> 02:01:01,660
But he kept throwing punches.

4455
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:04,750
So he got his back and then
he kind of face planted.

4456
02:01:04,780 --> 02:01:05,411
He was fine.

4457
02:01:05,411 --> 02:01:05,861
He was winning,

4458
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:06,694
but he face planted.

4459
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:06,971
Hey,

4460
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:08,290
take a one second break.

4461
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:09,281
But that position,

4462
02:01:09,281 --> 02:01:10,480
Damn Henderson was right there.

4463
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:13,030
Well Henderson Henderson went,

4464
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:14,620
I think he went for the deep half,

4465
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:15,760
if I remember correctly.

4466
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,250
And he got here and then he threw an
uppercut and he dropped like fate or like

4467
02:01:20,251 --> 02:01:21,760
face planted from the upper cut.

4468
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:24,520
I think he scrambled and
I think in the scramble,

4469
02:01:24,521 --> 02:01:26,450
Henderson landed a nasty
uppercut as far as,

4470
02:01:26,451 --> 02:01:27,370
that's how I remember it.

4471
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:31,360
And I knew went face plant
had them inside control.

4472
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:35,590
One side control beat comes
down to the fourth round.

4473
02:01:35,591 --> 02:01:36,160
We're going and forth,

4474
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,090
but we've got to pay attention to this.

4475
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,170
[inaudible]

4476
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,460
we'll watch it with watching for sure.

4477
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:41,391
But here we go.

4478
02:01:41,391 --> 02:01:42,290
Forth this fine.

4479
02:01:42,291 --> 02:01:43,250
People were hating on it.

4480
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:43,491
Oh,

4481
02:01:43,491 --> 02:01:44,001
I loved it.

4482
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:44,691
I loved this fire.

4483
02:01:44,691 --> 02:01:45,770
I'm so glad they made it.

4484
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:46,310
Yeah,

4485
02:01:46,310 --> 02:01:47,210
this is the fourth round.

4486
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:47,541
Only.

4487
02:01:47,541 --> 02:01:48,930
Holy fucking shit.

4488
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:50,480
Rockhold has gotta be home right now.

4489
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:50,811
Calling.

4490
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:52,010
What in the fuck?

4491
02:01:54,460 --> 02:01:57,050
How did I underestimate
this dude gangster?

4492
02:01:57,210 --> 02:01:58,790
My topping is tough.

4493
02:01:59,120 --> 02:01:59,751
He's gangsters.

4494
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:01,310
Fox until two on Henderson.

4495
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:03,230
Uh,

4496
02:02:03,230 --> 02:02:03,951
I don't know man.

4497
02:02:03,951 --> 02:02:04,641
We're in England.

4498
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:05,510
Who knows who's judging?

4499
02:02:05,820 --> 02:02:06,621
Who's you know.

4500
02:02:06,621 --> 02:02:07,580
I would agree with you.

4501
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:08,433
He wanted the last one.

4502
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,800
He's today one in my book under buddy.

4503
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,500
I'm with Eddie.

4504
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:13,370
It could be,

4505
02:02:13,460 --> 02:02:17,320
it could be two to one or someone might
have made the second round and even

4506
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:22,330
round may have gave that last
round to Dan Henderson to praise.

4507
02:02:25,810 --> 02:02:27,740
Our second was an inside job.

4508
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:30,740
Here goes,

4509
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:30,921
hey.

4510
02:02:30,921 --> 02:02:31,754
Just kidding.

4511
02:02:33,530 --> 02:02:34,410
I know I almost fucking

4512
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:40,303
got plenty of time.

4513
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:41,660
It's fight.

4514
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,493
We got to play any time.

4515
02:02:43,190 --> 02:02:44,240
We don't have to go anywhere.

4516
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:45,440
I wish you Jamin brought some.

4517
02:02:45,441 --> 02:02:46,130
We're going to keep going.

4518
02:02:46,130 --> 02:02:46,611
Eat or something.

4519
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:47,630
We get snack on,

4520
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,620
dude.

4521
02:02:48,620 --> 02:02:49,453
I got some

4522
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:53,390
Digiorno's fucking pizza crushes Domino's.

4523
02:02:53,391 --> 02:02:54,260
Remember that shit?

4524
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:57,680
Let's just watch the fight
inside leg kick by Henderson.

4525
02:02:58,200 --> 02:02:58,660
Okay.

4526
02:02:58,660 --> 02:02:58,940
Okay.

4527
02:02:58,940 --> 02:02:59,773
Oh,

4528
02:03:01,670 --> 02:03:02,600
he's talking to him?

4529
02:03:03,530 --> 02:03:04,363
Yeah,

4530
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:09,250
I got a piece saw.

4531
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,280
God.

4532
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:10,491
No,

4533
02:03:10,491 --> 02:03:11,324
I can't.

4534
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:14,001
I'm going to do that though.

4535
02:03:14,001 --> 02:03:14,331
Round.

4536
02:03:14,331 --> 02:03:14,771
Hey Dude.

4537
02:03:14,771 --> 02:03:18,020
We need to have someone invent something
that we could pee right here and like a

4538
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:18,650
little beautiful.

4539
02:03:18,650 --> 02:03:19,490
They got that.

4540
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:19,910
Oh,

4541
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,810
Bisbing hurt him.

4542
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:21,823
Where's it at?

4543
02:03:22,090 --> 02:03:25,640
Peace means just teeing
off man the volume,

4544
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,270
the volume of [inaudible] that he is
throwing their front leg side kick to the

4545
02:03:29,271 --> 02:03:30,104
knee.

4546
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,440
Well not to the knee above the knee.

4547
02:03:33,500 --> 02:03:34,420
Charlie Brown kids.

4548
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:36,980
So weird that you're not allowed
to target the joint with a strike,

4549
02:03:36,981 --> 02:03:37,731
but you're allowed to heal.

4550
02:03:37,731 --> 02:03:38,420
Hook somebody.

4551
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:40,820
What the fuck is that wasn't bad.

4552
02:03:40,850 --> 02:03:41,601
That is a weird rule,

4553
02:03:41,601 --> 02:03:41,890
Joe.

4554
02:03:41,890 --> 02:03:43,970
Like you can't front kick a
dude right on the kneecap,

4555
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:44,811
but you can heal.

4556
02:03:44,811 --> 02:03:48,270
Hook them who and rip his fucking Nia
parts cause you can't front kick the knee

4557
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:49,183
in some states.

4558
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:51,710
Some states have rules
against attacking the joy.

4559
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:52,520
What I've just done,

4560
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:53,650
their low most retarded,

4561
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:55,640
rather another local arrest.

4562
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,493
Dan,

4563
02:03:57,990 --> 02:04:00,260
these are sacred heads.

4564
02:04:00,261 --> 02:04:00,590
Okay.

4565
02:04:00,590 --> 02:04:01,710
Not the sacredness.

4566
02:04:01,850 --> 02:04:02,381
Dan's a pro.

4567
02:04:02,381 --> 02:04:06,890
He's gonna take some
time for 59 he's a pro.

4568
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:08,211
Yeah,

4569
02:04:08,211 --> 02:04:10,010
he got cracked the
second time of the fight.

4570
02:04:10,400 --> 02:04:10,960
Ooh,

4571
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:13,340
that was a nut sack son.

4572
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:14,960
Yeah,

4573
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:15,391
he's got,

4574
02:04:15,391 --> 02:04:17,110
but he's going to take it move.

4575
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:19,520
That's what your fucking
head have in big balls.

4576
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:20,001
Now here's,

4577
02:04:20,001 --> 02:04:20,810
let me ask you this.

4578
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:23,900
Do you think they should be able to
work on Michael Bisping's eye while Dan

4579
02:04:23,900 --> 02:04:25,900
Henderson is a is sitting
there recovering like,

4580
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:26,151
yeah,

4581
02:04:26,151 --> 02:04:27,810
it's an APP so foul.

4582
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,930
Would it be nice if he could
see a little bit better?

4583
02:04:29,990 --> 02:04:30,460
No,

4584
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:31,293
that would be bullshit.

4585
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:31,911
Well,

4586
02:04:31,911 --> 02:04:32,900
it's just time off.

4587
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:33,890
It's just an eye.

4588
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:34,850
Is he going to go back?

4589
02:04:35,150 --> 02:04:37,120
I was going to take the time taking.

4590
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:43,050
He's going to do the full five
east 46 the UFC a massage.

4591
02:04:43,051 --> 02:04:43,884
The balls.

4592
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:44,813
That doesn't help.

4593
02:04:45,320 --> 02:04:46,153
It just makes them hurt.

4594
02:04:46,350 --> 02:04:46,861
Trust me.

4595
02:04:46,861 --> 02:04:47,694
It helps.

4596
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,350
No matter what.

4597
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:52,310
This tells the plane goes away.

4598
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:53,620
See that he's stuffing.

4599
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:55,200
They kind of shake that ball down.

4600
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:58,830
Imagine if that was the
job of like one girl,

4601
02:04:58,890 --> 02:05:00,030
like this one girl was just like,

4602
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:01,980
she hasn't met the jihad ball massage.

4603
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:04,380
Now it's about the technique.

4604
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:05,010
What is,

4605
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:05,720
what does my watches,

4606
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,680
things like who cares
if she has fake tits?

4607
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,510
Michael Bisping is complaining.

4608
02:05:09,511 --> 02:05:10,980
The Dan Henderson is milking it.

4609
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:13,620
You started clapping and pointing to him.

4610
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:15,150
He's still taking his guys.

4611
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:16,021
He's a pro.

4612
02:05:16,021 --> 02:05:18,060
Dan Henderson is milking this.

4613
02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:19,140
He's a pro.

4614
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:19,450
I know.

4615
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:22,500
They don't know if that one
we go perfect timing this.

4616
02:05:22,501 --> 02:05:24,840
It's like you have a psyche
connection to Dan Henderson.

4617
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:25,713
If you're back,

4618
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:27,300
you're back from the can.

4619
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,870
I know of that when I see
it as it gives live time.

4620
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:31,771
He used it.

4621
02:05:31,771 --> 02:05:32,280
Well.

4622
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,390
How long do you think you waited?

4623
02:05:33,720 --> 02:05:36,660
Two minutes or three
minutes maybe even maybe.

4624
02:05:36,661 --> 02:05:37,020
Right?

4625
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:38,400
You got three rounds rests.

4626
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:39,420
That's a big rest.

4627
02:05:40,510 --> 02:05:45,510
4,600 of those cups where they make a
mold of your fucking Dick and your balls

4628
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:47,610
and I hear about those every day.

4629
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:49,081
No circles.

4630
02:05:49,081 --> 02:05:49,914
I travel

4631
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:55,950
and make got mold of you fucking
package and they make a cup around your

4632
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:56,823
packets.

4633
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:57,923
Let's watch the fight.

4634
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:58,620
Hey,

4635
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,800
two 18 and keep track of what
Dan does after that long break,

4636
02:06:02,160 --> 02:06:03,010
he's going to drop skin.

4637
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,580
Ask serious right hand,

4638
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,700
serious recovery.

4639
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:07,053
That's a long,

4640
02:06:07,630 --> 02:06:09,990
that was the left.

4641
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:10,530
We have that.

4642
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:12,450
The lack of flexibility in that leg kick.

4643
02:06:12,451 --> 02:06:13,970
That's on Charlie Brown cakes.

4644
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:16,220
World class level I think.

4645
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:16,860
Great.

4646
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:17,641
And he had kicked,

4647
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:19,060
he had kicked back to
the lumbar with that.

4648
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:20,250
Sure as hell did.

4649
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:21,570
Oh good job.

4650
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:23,460
Oh Man.

4651
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:24,780
You give him two minute Rasta,

4652
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,620
he fucked up.

4653
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,030
He had kicked lumbered with the right.

4654
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:30,180
I wonder if Dan Henderson was knocking
fools out like in junior high.

4655
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:30,891
I'm sure.

4656
02:06:30,891 --> 02:06:31,724
Raise your rates.

4657
02:06:32,080 --> 02:06:33,240
Here's what everybody forgets.

4658
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:34,403
Everybody forgets.

4659
02:06:34,410 --> 02:06:35,940
They used to call him decision.

4660
02:06:35,941 --> 02:06:36,774
Dan,

4661
02:06:36,850 --> 02:06:37,710
he forgets this.

4662
02:06:37,711 --> 02:06:38,190
Yes.

4663
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:40,290
I did a whole piece about
this for the UFC recently.

4664
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:45,360
That it wasn't until 2003 it was when
he knocked out my real Bustamante.

4665
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:49,140
He knocked out Marula Bustamante and
everybody knew that he had power.

4666
02:06:49,170 --> 02:06:51,390
Like remember he fucked up
Vandelay he hurt his eye.

4667
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:54,720
I think that was 2001 if I
remember correctly in pride.

4668
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:58,740
But around the Marillo Bustamonte fight,

4669
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:01,860
he started realizing he
could Merck motherfuckers.

4670
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:07,130
So he started really like throwing all
his power into shots as something changed

4671
02:07:07,951 --> 02:07:12,210
in Dan Henderson's fight style because
now everybody knows him has one of the

4672
02:07:12,211 --> 02:07:14,370
most dangerous knockout punches ever.

4673
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:18,480
But they used to call them
decision Dan on the underground.

4674
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:19,440
That was his nickname.

4675
02:07:19,441 --> 02:07:20,390
Riddick Bowe had this,

4676
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:23,190
went through the same thing Riddick
Bowe never knocked anybody had in the

4677
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:23,800
beginning.

4678
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,320
And then when he was
criticized about that,

4679
02:07:25,321 --> 02:07:26,340
then he started fucking people.

4680
02:07:26,341 --> 02:07:27,031
That's a little different.

4681
02:07:27,031 --> 02:07:27,590
Cause Dan,

4682
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:29,610
you know with his worldclass
wrestling back on,

4683
02:07:29,611 --> 02:07:31,550
he's just decision guys
using these grappling.

4684
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:32,430
They freak out.

4685
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:32,851
Oh Shit.

4686
02:07:32,851 --> 02:07:33,211
That's right.

4687
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:34,110
Hand is from God.

4688
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:34,960
Check this out.

4689
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:35,351
Yeah.

4690
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:36,130
Also different

4691
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:38,470
because there's only
one thing that correct.

4692
02:07:38,570 --> 02:07:39,070
You know,

4693
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:40,670
I mean we're,

4694
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:41,590
we're talking about,

4695
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,391
wow,

4696
02:07:43,391 --> 02:07:43,781
look at this.

4697
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:44,950
When Riddick Bowe was fighting,

4698
02:07:44,951 --> 02:07:46,090
he was just boxing.

4699
02:07:46,210 --> 02:07:49,510
Now Dan learned how to strike
while he was MMA fighting.

4700
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:50,230
Correct.

4701
02:07:50,230 --> 02:07:52,660
Learn how to just drop
Haymac cause I came into it.

4702
02:07:52,661 --> 02:07:54,040
Just a straight wrestler.

4703
02:07:54,070 --> 02:07:54,700
Yeah.

4704
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,770
Look at Biz being thrown.

4705
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:56,380
Sidekicks,

4706
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:57,213
you the neat

4707
02:07:59,030 --> 02:07:59,291
things.

4708
02:07:59,291 --> 02:08:02,500
I came in to get appointment
that I swelled up real proper.

4709
02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:06,910
Well Bisping has a background
in traditional martial
arts and a lot of people

4710
02:08:06,911 --> 02:08:07,541
forget that.

4711
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:08,890
Like he's a really good kicker.

4712
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:14,140
It didn't happen at like 17 I'm not
surprised as good karate to head.

4713
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:17,610
Is it two around?

4714
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:18,461
Is it to,

4715
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:19,690
to who won that round?

4716
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:20,350
I know.

4717
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,550
Got To give that to best pattern.

4718
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:22,720
No volume.

4719
02:08:22,721 --> 02:08:23,650
What did Henderson do?

4720
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:26,200
He landed a few left jabs.

4721
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:26,681
Right.

4722
02:08:26,681 --> 02:08:30,280
But the volume of strikes and overall
you've got to give it to best bang.

4723
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:32,470
So this might be the deciding right now.

4724
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:33,363
This is crazy.

4725
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:34,900
Empathy's Cardio's insane.

4726
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:35,980
I would assume.

4727
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:38,380
I think bisman puts on a flurry here,

4728
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:38,581
but he's,

4729
02:08:38,581 --> 02:08:40,660
he'll open himself up to
a huge right hand maybe.

4730
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:41,021
But the,

4731
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:42,340
so the second round is,

4732
02:08:42,341 --> 02:08:43,080
well here you go.

4733
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:47,290
Do the Henderson did not fight hard at
the end of the round after he came back

4734
02:08:47,291 --> 02:08:48,310
after taking that break,

4735
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:50,380
some of that might've
been part of his strategy.

4736
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:50,981
He might've said,

4737
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:51,191
look,

4738
02:08:51,191 --> 02:08:52,930
I'm going to take this big
gray the fifth I'm going to.

4739
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:53,291
Yeah.

4740
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:53,621
And then,

4741
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:53,890
um,

4742
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:58,240
this is a really smart move because I'll
have a deep gas tank in the fifth round

4743
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:02,410
and it's his last round of his
career and have since last name.

4744
02:09:02,590 --> 02:09:03,700
That's what he's been saying.

4745
02:09:03,701 --> 02:09:04,211
Yeah.

4746
02:09:04,211 --> 02:09:05,140
But I would say that too,

4747
02:09:05,141 --> 02:09:07,960
if I was trying to renegotiate my contract
as the middleweight champion of the

4748
02:09:07,961 --> 02:09:08,530
world,

4749
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:10,060
but Bisbing is at home.

4750
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:10,960
I got a good idea.

4751
02:09:10,961 --> 02:09:11,794
I bet he's done.

4752
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:13,180
He might be done,

4753
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:16,170
but why he's your cyber
fire to the restaurant.

4754
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:17,033
Go,

4755
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:17,943
come on baby.

4756
02:09:18,070 --> 02:09:18,800
Come on baby.

4757
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:20,260
You ever see Dan Henderson fight?

4758
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:21,940
This is a big five minutes.

4759
02:09:21,970 --> 02:09:23,100
Fuck yeah,

4760
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:24,133
me go.

4761
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:24,671
Here we go.

4762
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:25,600
The legend.

4763
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:26,741
Okay.

4764
02:09:26,741 --> 02:09:27,610
If he wins this fight,

4765
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:30,040
he arguably has the
greatest career of all time.

4766
02:09:30,070 --> 02:09:30,970
Let's think about that.

4767
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:31,880
What's on the line?

4768
02:09:31,880 --> 02:09:32,980
This next strike force.

4769
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:33,491
UFC.

4770
02:09:33,491 --> 02:09:33,850
Yeah.

4771
02:09:33,850 --> 02:09:37,990
Two two titles simultaneously and prides
Strikeforce title knocked out Faye

4772
02:09:37,990 --> 02:09:38,230
Door,

4773
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:43,230
knocked out Hector Lombard in his last
fight and at 46 years old if he could

4774
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:44,050
win.

4775
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:45,910
It's arguably as the
greatest career of all time.

4776
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:46,744
Look at Bisping.

4777
02:09:47,430 --> 02:09:50,860
He's looking at an Olympic medal,

4778
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:51,560
right?

4779
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:51,860
No,

4780
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:52,140
no,

4781
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:52,271
no.

4782
02:09:52,271 --> 02:09:53,104
He was silver.

4783
02:09:53,230 --> 02:09:53,860
Silver,

4784
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:54,730
silver in the Olympics.

4785
02:09:54,731 --> 02:09:55,564
Yeah,

4786
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:56,920
that's a career.

4787
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:57,610
Oh yeah.

4788
02:09:57,610 --> 02:09:58,100
Oh He's,

4789
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,290
he's on the Mount Rushmore.

4790
02:09:59,320 --> 02:09:59,441
Yeah,

4791
02:09:59,441 --> 02:10:00,430
100% for sure.

4792
02:10:00,460 --> 02:10:01,560
If legends second.

4793
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:04,810
The first guy I was there for his
first fight in the UFC in 1996.

4794
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:05,321
Damn,

4795
02:10:05,321 --> 02:10:06,154
that's old school.

4796
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,751
Remember he fought frank.

4797
02:10:07,751 --> 02:10:10,290
She said 96 why does this no six?

4798
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:10,841
No,

4799
02:10:10,841 --> 02:10:13,030
it couldn't have been
96 because my first uh,

4800
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:14,920
time in the UFC was in 97.

4801
02:10:15,580 --> 02:10:17,740
So it must have been 97 or 98.

4802
02:10:17,770 --> 02:10:17,940
Dude,

4803
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:20,290
I think you're writing about
him saving for this last round.

4804
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,153
Yeah.

4805
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:21,460
Yeah.

4806
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:22,780
Well that's what a veteran would do,

4807
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:23,560
right?

4808
02:10:23,560 --> 02:10:24,640
You got that three minutes.

4809
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:27,880
Let's just skate for the next
and try to blow them out.

4810
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,893
What year was,

4811
02:10:28,990 --> 02:10:29,560
yeah,

4812
02:10:29,560 --> 02:10:30,393
powerful memory.

4813
02:10:30,460 --> 02:10:31,061
98.

4814
02:10:31,061 --> 02:10:31,370
Sorry.

4815
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:34,130
98 [inaudible] 97 open 98

4816
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:34,330
year.

4817
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:35,163
Ryan goes,

4818
02:10:35,180 --> 02:10:35,331
oh,

4819
02:10:35,331 --> 02:10:35,751
that's right.

4820
02:10:35,751 --> 02:10:37,250
Allen goes very controversial.

4821
02:10:37,251 --> 02:10:38,840
Descend on unanimous decision.

4822
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:39,260
Hey,

4823
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:41,780
have you ever seen Alan
goes versus Frank Shamrock?

4824
02:10:41,810 --> 02:10:42,643
Sure haven't.

4825
02:10:42,770 --> 02:10:43,190
Oh Shit.

4826
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:44,270
That was in pancreas.

4827
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:45,380
Palm strikes only.

4828
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:46,220
Watch that show.

4829
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:47,140
I'll never met at pawn.

4830
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:47,870
Here we go.

4831
02:10:47,870 --> 02:10:48,650
Here we go.

4832
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:51,710
Three 36 this is big.

4833
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:53,090
This is huge.

4834
02:10:53,250 --> 02:10:54,083
Come on baby.

4835
02:10:55,370 --> 02:10:55,810
Okay.

4836
02:10:55,810 --> 02:10:56,500
Ooh,

4837
02:10:56,500 --> 02:10:57,670
nice combination.

4838
02:10:57,850 --> 02:10:59,650
See when you're looking at sheer volume,

4839
02:10:59,651 --> 02:11:00,750
Bisping's got a big leaguer.

4840
02:11:00,751 --> 02:11:01,390
Yeah.

4841
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,120
And see the,

4842
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:07,120
there's an argument to be said for
breaking fights up in rounds is not wise,

4843
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:10,870
and that the wise way to judge
a fight is to give them rounds,

4844
02:11:10,871 --> 02:11:12,820
but judge the fight as a whole,

4845
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:14,260
that's what pride did.

4846
02:11:14,261 --> 02:11:19,261
And I think that's the more
effective God that was like uh,

4847
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:20,710
like he's got some kind of,

4848
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:22,620
he's like the guru reefer with last shit.

4849
02:11:22,740 --> 02:11:24,280
It's just comes down to the power.

4850
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:25,880
Ridiculous crouch.

4851
02:11:25,900 --> 02:11:27,100
What are those blades called?

4852
02:11:27,101 --> 02:11:27,934
Sickles.

4853
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:28,580
Yes.

4854
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:29,080
Yeah.

4855
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:30,520
Blocked that left high kick.

4856
02:11:31,610 --> 02:11:32,260
Kick has him in.

4857
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:37,090
I think that we have a flawed system and
a guy being able to win around and then

4858
02:11:37,091 --> 02:11:38,170
went around and,

4859
02:11:38,530 --> 02:11:43,360
and then a couple rounds later he gets
almost finished and the fight ends with

4860
02:11:43,361 --> 02:11:45,490
him being almost finished
but yet he could still win.

4861
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:47,590
Cause cause you're saying
cause that guy won the fight.

4862
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:49,000
The other guy won on the card.

4863
02:11:49,700 --> 02:11:50,560
He won the game.

4864
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:51,400
How about knockout?

4865
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:56,290
Only MMA like you own wholly knockout
or submission or some imagined it's

4866
02:11:56,291 --> 02:11:57,480
finished has agreed to that

4867
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:00,173
same.

4868
02:12:00,370 --> 02:12:00,931
You keep going,

4869
02:12:00,931 --> 02:12:01,830
you over time around.

4870
02:12:01,831 --> 02:12:04,090
So someone gets finished and
you do it in a football field.

4871
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:04,720
Yes.

4872
02:12:04,720 --> 02:12:05,560
Let's do you want to do it?

4873
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:06,700
How is it all down to

4874
02:12:08,820 --> 02:12:09,653
dog?

4875
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,920
Don't make this shit happen.

4876
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:13,600
Reservation.

4877
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:14,170
Hey,

4878
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:14,910
we're going to call it.

4879
02:12:14,910 --> 02:12:19,910
Oh left Pittsburgh with a beautiful
right left and right there.

4880
02:12:21,880 --> 02:12:22,541
Nice Jab.

4881
02:12:22,541 --> 02:12:23,770
Is there already an RFC?

4882
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:24,663
Oh,

4883
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:24,941
nice.

4884
02:12:24,941 --> 02:12:26,260
Inside leg kick by Dan.

4885
02:12:26,890 --> 02:12:28,780
Probably reality fighting championships.

4886
02:12:28,781 --> 02:12:29,500
Wasn't that something?

4887
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,570
Fight companion championships.

4888
02:12:32,050 --> 02:12:35,560
Just to call it the Rogan fight league
if I can paint championships is good.

4889
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,010
Yeah.

4890
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:36,340
Shit.

4891
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:36,640
The wheat.

4892
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:36,920
Oh.

4893
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:38,020
Oh,

4894
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:38,830
Henderson with the right.

4895
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:39,700
Careful over there.

4896
02:12:40,300 --> 02:12:40,601
Dot.

4897
02:12:40,601 --> 02:12:43,050
Careful in that cage is
being one 43 degrees.

4898
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:44,110
The crowd's going nuts.

4899
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:45,340
Take some down.

4900
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:47,020
Are you kidding me?

4901
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:48,370
He's got his back,

4902
02:12:48,371 --> 02:12:48,670
dude.

4903
02:12:48,670 --> 02:12:49,630
Oh Shit.

4904
02:12:50,260 --> 02:12:52,720
He's going to get a knee bar
is going to roll for knee bar.

4905
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:53,081
Damn.

4906
02:12:53,081 --> 02:12:55,580
What the fuck are you just down
looking at the Greco Roman?

4907
02:12:55,581 --> 02:12:57,490
He's about to do some
nasty ground and pound him.

4908
02:12:58,270 --> 02:12:58,720
Now.

4909
02:12:58,720 --> 02:13:01,030
Did [inaudible] not gone into effect yet,

4910
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:01,950
honey?

4911
02:13:01,950 --> 02:13:02,980
We got on the ground,

4912
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:03,873
dude.

4913
02:13:04,540 --> 02:13:05,373
Oh Shit.

4914
02:13:06,400 --> 02:13:08,140
Oh Shit.

4915
02:13:08,200 --> 02:13:09,033
One seven two,

4916
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:10,113
one,

4917
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:14,980
one big deep breaths and
Bisping's got that crazy cardio

4918
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:16,190
really quick.

4919
02:13:17,120 --> 02:13:18,350
They both look a little dude.

4920
02:13:18,351 --> 02:13:19,184
What does that decision,

4921
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:20,870
Beautiful Jab in England.

4922
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:23,390
She was like,

4923
02:13:23,390 --> 02:13:26,960
this is going to be mad at a
busy being decision in England,

4924
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:29,930
but I guarantee you the UFC
brought their own judges.

4925
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:30,890
You think?

4926
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:31,650
Oh yeah,

4927
02:13:31,650 --> 02:13:32,310
I would imagine

4928
02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:33,560
a bird out of badging.

4929
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:33,811
Oh,

4930
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:34,644
look at this.

4931
02:13:34,720 --> 02:13:38,370
I would imagine you can't
really rely on the local judges.

4932
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:42,290
I can't rely on the American judge.

4933
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:43,370
He does.

4934
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:45,780
He's not going to take him down.

4935
02:13:45,870 --> 02:13:46,531
Oh,

4936
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:47,670
that doesn't make them look good.

4937
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:49,500
He's going to lose this round.

4938
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:50,550
Oh,

4939
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:51,570
not necessarily.

4940
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:55,770
There's still 32 seconds
of hammertime possibly.

4941
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:57,143
That's true.

4942
02:13:57,240 --> 02:13:59,460
He's landed more strikes
in the last three rounds.

4943
02:14:00,150 --> 02:14:00,983
That's what it says.

4944
02:14:02,210 --> 02:14:02,740
Yes,

4945
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:03,300
for sure.

4946
02:14:03,300 --> 02:14:08,300
Then the last significant
one to ten eight left.

4947
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:09,970
Do you see that one gotta be a tenant?

4948
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:11,190
I would say so for sure.

4949
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:12,300
It's going to be a draw then.

4950
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:13,500
Who the fuck knows?

4951
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:13,770
Right?

4952
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:14,180
Trial.

4953
02:14:14,180 --> 02:14:15,070
We still don't have exact.

4954
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:16,570
Tends to draw from rare.

4955
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:17,730
They get this.

4956
02:14:19,860 --> 02:14:20,670
How much time?

4957
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:21,450
10 seconds.

4958
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:25,630
No Fun events over to Cartwheel
kick when we volume ends.

4959
02:14:25,631 --> 02:14:26,490
The fight on his back.

4960
02:14:26,491 --> 02:14:27,150
That ain't good.

4961
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:27,720
No.

4962
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,330
Terrible.

4963
02:14:28,330 --> 02:14:29,300
His big might.

4964
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:31,260
This decision that he got it.

4965
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,011
He might've.

4966
02:14:32,011 --> 02:14:33,570
Why don't I bet he going to be a drone.

4967
02:14:33,571 --> 02:14:35,010
You can one the last three rounds,

4968
02:14:35,011 --> 02:14:36,630
but the first round with a ten eight draw.

4969
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:38,213
Who knows?

4970
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:39,210
It wouldn't do a draw.

4971
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:39,691
It's done.

4972
02:14:39,691 --> 02:14:41,910
We could turn it off now
start talking about RFC.

4973
02:14:43,590 --> 02:14:44,091
Oh,

4974
02:14:44,091 --> 02:14:45,600
we were going to talk about something.

4975
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:46,411
What?

4976
02:14:46,411 --> 02:14:46,800
Fight.

4977
02:14:46,800 --> 02:14:47,011
Oh,

4978
02:14:47,011 --> 02:14:49,950
fader door and Dan Henderson pull
up the fader and Dan Henderson,

4979
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:50,813
cause

4980
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:53,341
this is what I think,

4981
02:14:53,341 --> 02:14:55,200
I think Fado was on top
ground and pound in.

4982
02:14:55,201 --> 02:14:56,670
Henderson went to deep half.

4983
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:57,930
He reversed him,

4984
02:14:57,960 --> 02:15:00,120
got into a position where
he's on his back and he did.

4985
02:15:00,121 --> 02:15:04,080
When the upper cut and
flat faced a fatal I,

4986
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,370
that's exactly what happened.

4987
02:15:05,370 --> 02:15:07,650
Then he finished off with ground
and potato or cracked them,

4988
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:09,690
dropped it and he dropped him.

4989
02:15:09,960 --> 02:15:14,160
And then fader was inside control
trying to finish him from side control.

4990
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:19,110
Dan Henderson hit that under hook and
he hit that under Jack under hook face,

4991
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:20,100
planetary door.

4992
02:15:20,120 --> 02:15:21,030
Here's base plan of,

4993
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:21,600
here it is.

4994
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:23,090
Let's just watch it too.

4995
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:23,993
What happens?

4996
02:15:24,250 --> 02:15:24,630
Let's see.

4997
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:24,931
Let's see.

4998
02:15:24,931 --> 02:15:26,350
The business decision first.

4999
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:26,600
Yeah,

5000
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,433
for sure.

5001
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,001
But they,

5002
02:15:28,001 --> 02:15:28,261
they're gonna,

5003
02:15:28,261 --> 02:15:29,640
it's gonna take a few
seconds for the show.

5004
02:15:29,641 --> 02:15:30,474
That decision.

5005
02:15:31,560 --> 02:15:32,191
So here,

5006
02:15:32,191 --> 02:15:33,024
uh,

5007
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:35,040
push ahead to the stoppage tracks.

5008
02:15:35,310 --> 02:15:36,660
It looks like he cracks,

5009
02:15:36,661 --> 02:15:38,460
Henderson has him on
the ground before that.

5010
02:15:38,461 --> 02:15:39,294
Buddy,

5011
02:15:39,540 --> 02:15:39,991
so yeah,

5012
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:40,830
he drops him.

5013
02:15:41,070 --> 02:15:42,420
He ends up in side control.

5014
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:44,980
Dan Henderson from side control
hat grabs the under hook.

5015
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:49,530
It takes it to dogfight fight or doesn't
throw whizzer and he exposes his back

5016
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:50,550
and then he hits him with a shot.

5017
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:51,600
You're very confident in their,

5018
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:53,940
so I'm inclined to think that you
know what you're talking about.

5019
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,680
I'm never when I could be wrong.

5020
02:15:55,681 --> 02:15:57,900
Now I have a lower buddy and I'm like,

5021
02:15:57,901 --> 02:15:58,231
damn,

5022
02:15:58,231 --> 02:15:59,610
I didn't remembered it all wrong.

5023
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,020
I could easily be wrong.

5024
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:03,460
That's also fade or fade or there.

5025
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:04,110
By the way,

5026
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:05,190
that's the sort of,

5027
02:16:05,250 --> 02:16:08,670
that's Fado that had been stopped
by big Silva still though.

5028
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:10,740
It was also the big,

5029
02:16:10,770 --> 02:16:13,820
big Brett Rogers and didn't
do well in that fight.

5030
02:16:14,390 --> 02:16:15,450
Worries that real quick.

5031
02:16:15,451 --> 02:16:15,810
Here does.

5032
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:16,461
He drops him.

5033
02:16:16,461 --> 02:16:17,101
This is the fight,

5034
02:16:17,101 --> 02:16:17,640
right?

5035
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:18,990
He hits him with a hard punch.

5036
02:16:19,050 --> 02:16:19,261
See,

5037
02:16:19,261 --> 02:16:20,094
here's the deal.

5038
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:21,663
Oh,

5039
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:23,090
drop some flat foot

5040
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:25,543
control

5041
02:16:29,090 --> 02:16:29,923
path.

5042
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,060
We go to the coach's book cards.

5043
02:16:33,140 --> 02:16:35,200
Burgess judges score in the car.

5044
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,220
Oh Shit.

5045
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:36,790
Here he comes.

5046
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:41,450
47 48 47 and 49 46

5047
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:49,890
oh shit.

5048
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,120
Wow.

5049
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:53,240
I'll tell you what those Rockhold

5050
02:16:55,350 --> 02:16:56,310
licking their chops.

5051
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:03,920
Wow.

5052
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:06,120
That was a fricking fight.

5053
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:10,590
You know what happened for this powerful
has been at the end of the fight,

5054
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:12,090
however you scored,

5055
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:12,993
please

5056
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:14,813
listen to him.

5057
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:16,140
They just said something to each other.

5058
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:18,593
Shit.

5059
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:20,883
Sorry about that.

5060
02:17:21,730 --> 02:17:22,980
I want to hear what they're
saying to each other.

5061
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:24,720
It's been quite good.

5062
02:17:24,810 --> 02:17:26,240
People talk about your skill.

5063
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:30,680
Let's watch the feed or
knock out one more time.

5064
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:33,710
I wonder what business should
I say it one more time.

5065
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:34,700
Let's see what he says.

5066
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:35,533
Slow motion.

5067
02:17:37,880 --> 02:17:39,080
Give it up for Dan Henderson.

5068
02:17:39,230 --> 02:17:39,820
Beautiful.

5069
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:40,051
Good.

5070
02:17:40,051 --> 02:17:40,884
That goldfish.

5071
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:42,080
We can't really play this though.

5072
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:42,950
The problem is we can't.

5073
02:17:43,050 --> 02:17:44,270
I see what you're saying.

5074
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:46,040
It's not ours,

5075
02:17:46,760 --> 02:17:47,593
so look,

5076
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:48,380
you got to look.

5077
02:17:48,380 --> 02:17:48,850
Look right.

5078
02:17:48,850 --> 02:17:49,683
Hurts him.

5079
02:17:49,700 --> 02:17:50,540
He's boom.

5080
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:52,400
Crowd control.

5081
02:17:52,520 --> 02:17:53,630
He grabs the under hood.

5082
02:17:53,631 --> 02:17:53,841
Yeah,

5083
02:17:53,841 --> 02:17:54,460
you're right.

5084
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:54,800
Yeah.

5085
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:56,330
It looked like it was a deep house.

5086
02:17:57,320 --> 02:17:59,810
His right leg was on the outside.

5087
02:18:01,090 --> 02:18:01,960
It may have been quarter.

5088
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:02,811
You may have had the foot.

5089
02:18:02,811 --> 02:18:04,460
It's hard to tell one more time.

5090
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,153
It wasn't the deep.

5091
02:18:06,160 --> 02:18:06,830
Yeah,

5092
02:18:06,830 --> 02:18:07,011
no,

5093
02:18:07,011 --> 02:18:07,730
you're right.

5094
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:11,330
I thought for some reason I had
imagined that his right leg was in play.

5095
02:18:11,331 --> 02:18:12,560
That it was in between the legs.

5096
02:18:12,561 --> 02:18:13,394
But you're right.

5097
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,421
You're totally right.

5098
02:18:14,421 --> 02:18:14,870
Look,

5099
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:15,990
he siren sound right there.

5100
02:18:15,990 --> 02:18:16,711
You second control.

5101
02:18:16,711 --> 02:18:17,570
Maybe border guard,

5102
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:18,723
man.

5103
02:18:18,970 --> 02:18:19,340
Fight.

5104
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:19,490
No.

5105
02:18:19,490 --> 02:18:20,840
Wizard uppercuts.

5106
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:21,680
Yep.

5107
02:18:21,680 --> 02:18:21,831
No,

5108
02:18:21,831 --> 02:18:22,664
you're totally right.

5109
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:23,450
He did it.

5110
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:24,400
He did it from the,

5111
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:25,910
is that Michael Bisping's dad there?

5112
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,173
That is.

5113
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:28,573
Wow.

5114
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:30,290
I feel good for that guy.

5115
02:18:30,310 --> 02:18:31,143
Defensive it.

5116
02:18:31,250 --> 02:18:32,083
Big Win.

5117
02:18:32,090 --> 02:18:33,710
I feel good for that guy in his hometown.

5118
02:18:33,740 --> 02:18:34,573
Yeah.

5119
02:18:34,700 --> 02:18:35,210
Big Win.

5120
02:18:35,210 --> 02:18:36,560
I wished both would retire.

5121
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:37,431
I know it's controversial.

5122
02:18:37,431 --> 02:18:40,400
I wish Bisbing you want them to retire?

5123
02:18:40,401 --> 02:18:40,821
Why?

5124
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:41,870
He's not too old.

5125
02:18:42,320 --> 02:18:43,790
Like what is it his,

5126
02:18:43,880 --> 02:18:45,690
if he loses when he loses a lot

5127
02:18:47,390 --> 02:18:48,470
of great fights coming up.

5128
02:18:49,340 --> 02:18:51,170
A big paydays coming up.

5129
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:51,480
Yeah.

5130
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,313
Big Page.

5131
02:18:52,660 --> 02:18:54,410
You gotta to worry about it too much.

5132
02:18:54,560 --> 02:18:57,080
Is it just as much as anybody if not more?

5133
02:18:57,110 --> 02:18:57,350
Yeah.

5134
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:57,740
Okay.

5135
02:18:57,740 --> 02:18:59,480
Tell me which fight he's
favorite unless she goes,

5136
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:00,200
oh,

5137
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:01,490
brain Weidman,

5138
02:19:01,670 --> 02:19:02,440
rocky guy.

5139
02:19:02,440 --> 02:19:04,040
That's the guy enjoys victory

5140
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:07,970
match that he's in.

5141
02:19:08,660 --> 02:19:08,961
He could,

5142
02:19:08,961 --> 02:19:10,110
when he got a point,

5143
02:19:10,111 --> 02:19:11,570
he could win every match point.

5144
02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:12,600
You never know,

5145
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:12,820
right?

5146
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:14,230
Hey Rockhold you never know.

5147
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:17,510
I'm just saying he's doing the blocking
every single one of those matchups

5148
02:19:17,550 --> 02:19:19,370
that's why he's the underdog
in the Rockhold fight.

5149
02:19:19,371 --> 02:19:20,210
And that's how he won the title.

5150
02:19:20,211 --> 02:19:20,991
That'd be the exception.

5151
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:21,410
But you're right.

5152
02:19:21,410 --> 02:19:21,920
Do you think he say,

5153
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:22,210
what did he,

5154
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:23,360
was he favored in this fight?

5155
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:23,841
Yes.

5156
02:19:23,841 --> 02:19:24,674
Two to one.

5157
02:19:24,910 --> 02:19:25,321
Two to one.

5158
02:19:25,321 --> 02:19:25,940
It's big.

5159
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:26,211
Okay.

5160
02:19:26,211 --> 02:19:27,080
Here's the scary fight.

5161
02:19:27,200 --> 02:19:28,250
Him Eol

5162
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,460
Romero and Rockhold.

5163
02:19:31,461 --> 02:19:35,420
Rematches a monster riot halls monster.

5164
02:19:35,421 --> 02:19:35,780
Dude.

5165
02:19:35,780 --> 02:19:38,720
Uriah hall got stopped in his
last fight by Derek Brunson,

5166
02:19:38,721 --> 02:19:39,860
but he's a God damn monster.

5167
02:19:39,890 --> 02:19:41,640
I don't think they're all
monsters right now though.

5168
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:43,250
Who's not worried about them?

5169
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:46,380
Because Michael is down 10 nos.

5170
02:19:46,890 --> 02:19:47,230
Why?

5171
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:48,730
Fuck Weidman's dangerous.

5172
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,573
Fuck.

5173
02:19:50,840 --> 02:19:51,441
Don't sleep.

5174
02:19:51,441 --> 02:19:52,460
Don't sleep on Talus.

5175
02:19:52,470 --> 02:19:54,290
Latus he's one of those guys like,

5176
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:55,760
he's just like Damien Maia.

5177
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:57,860
They came in pure Jujitsu,

5178
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:59,210
didn't have striking,

5179
02:19:59,330 --> 02:20:00,290
didn't have wrestling,

5180
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:01,550
but a lot of,

5181
02:20:01,630 --> 02:20:01,910
uh,

5182
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:03,080
Jujitsu guys would have just said,

5183
02:20:03,081 --> 02:20:03,530
fuck it.

5184
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:04,070
I got,

5185
02:20:04,070 --> 02:20:05,390
there's enough money in Jujitsu,

5186
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:06,021
you know,

5187
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:07,040
myself included.

5188
02:20:07,130 --> 02:20:08,240
No need to do that.

5189
02:20:08,290 --> 02:20:08,720
It's true.

5190
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:08,960
You know?

5191
02:20:08,960 --> 02:20:10,160
But he stuck it up.

5192
02:20:10,280 --> 02:20:11,780
Damien Maia stuck it out.

5193
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,640
Rowan Carnero stuck it out.

5194
02:20:13,700 --> 02:20:14,431
If I breached the word,

5195
02:20:14,431 --> 02:20:14,630
don't,

5196
02:20:14,630 --> 02:20:17,540
we're doing stuck it out
and then now they're legit.

5197
02:20:17,541 --> 02:20:19,250
Stryker's now with legit wrestling.

5198
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,960
I heard for resolvers
came to sember Senate.

5199
02:20:22,220 --> 02:20:23,053
That's what I heard.

5200
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:24,190
That's the rumor mill.

5201
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:26,810
Fallis late has got an
arm triangle from hell.

5202
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:27,950
He could put anybody.

5203
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,271
Let me ask you this.

5204
02:20:29,271 --> 02:20:30,380
That's a sleeper right there.

5205
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:31,970
Why would they have that fight?

5206
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:33,200
Steeping needs time off.

5207
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:34,400
How much time was he needed off?

5208
02:20:34,900 --> 02:20:36,590
Enough time for those guys
to fight in the winter.

5209
02:20:36,591 --> 02:20:37,424
It's interesting.

5210
02:20:37,560 --> 02:20:38,300
That's interesting.

5211
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,080
Do you agree with that?

5212
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:40,160
Do you think that's good idea.

5213
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:40,750
I do.

5214
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:44,690
To have a cane or a ratio you can do
because if you have Cain and for Bho,

5215
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,640
both weight and fight different guys,

5216
02:20:46,641 --> 02:20:47,300
you know what I'm saying?

5217
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:47,901
You could have that.

5218
02:20:47,901 --> 02:20:49,250
That could be a headliner to fuck.

5219
02:20:49,251 --> 02:20:52,730
You have to headline two Oh seven yeah.

5220
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:56,810
What side of Jamie [inaudible]
December 30th to sell new years eve,

5221
02:20:56,811 --> 02:20:58,940
so they'd probably be
the Ronda Rousey fight.

5222
02:20:58,941 --> 02:20:59,840
If she comes back,

5223
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:01,940
she'll probably be on
the New Year's Eve card.

5224
02:21:01,970 --> 02:21:03,420
That's usually their biggest cost.

5225
02:21:03,421 --> 02:21:04,254
That's going to happen.

5226
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:05,653
Who knows?

5227
02:21:06,480 --> 02:21:07,313
Uh,

5228
02:21:07,650 --> 02:21:07,990
you,

5229
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:08,810
you don't know.

5230
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:09,500
I mean,

5231
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:10,333
I

5232
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:12,470
have no idea about this.

5233
02:21:12,471 --> 02:21:12,920
You don't,

5234
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:13,880
you don't really know.

5235
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:14,391
This is cool.

5236
02:21:14,391 --> 02:21:18,530
They're shaking hands and he's giving
them props because he retired right now.

5237
02:21:18,650 --> 02:21:19,131
I don't know.

5238
02:21:19,131 --> 02:21:19,964
I think he is.

5239
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:28,380
I wish we judge the
fight on how you look at

5240
02:21:29,970 --> 02:21:30,870
legend son.

5241
02:21:32,630 --> 02:21:33,550
That's cool.

5242
02:21:34,150 --> 02:21:35,110
Good for Bisbing man.

5243
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:38,371
What did he say?

5244
02:21:38,371 --> 02:21:39,204
I don't know

5245
02:21:41,130 --> 02:21:41,400
which.

5246
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:43,410
We tried to fight on how
you look after the fight.

5247
02:21:43,420 --> 02:21:44,700
How busted up.

5248
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:45,870
How rude.

5249
02:21:46,930 --> 02:21:47,970
That's great.

5250
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:48,390
Fine.

5251
02:21:48,390 --> 02:21:49,920
That's a funny thing to say.

5252
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,750
Back at Bisping's career,

5253
02:21:51,751 --> 02:21:55,050
when they do a documentary
on that show on Hbo,

5254
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:57,180
it ended right now.

5255
02:21:57,210 --> 02:21:58,043
Fuck,

5256
02:21:58,230 --> 02:21:58,940
look at the guys.

5257
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:00,150
He's well.

5258
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:00,870
Well yeah,

5259
02:22:00,870 --> 02:22:03,090
he's by far the biggest thing
ever happened in UK MMA.

5260
02:22:03,110 --> 02:22:04,200
But you look at his career,

5261
02:22:04,201 --> 02:22:04,651
looking at the guys,

5262
02:22:04,651 --> 02:22:07,530
he's lost to most of our TRT
guys and looking at the ics beat.

5263
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:07,861
Okay,

5264
02:22:07,861 --> 02:22:09,150
but the UK is Ireland,

5265
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:09,871
right?

5266
02:22:09,871 --> 02:22:11,310
Didn't we establish that?

5267
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,110
It's not someone tweeted and said,

5268
02:22:13,111 --> 02:22:13,440
no,

5269
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:13,800
no.

5270
02:22:13,800 --> 02:22:14,820
Sorry folks.

5271
02:22:14,940 --> 02:22:15,751
We're so sorry.

5272
02:22:15,751 --> 02:22:16,800
All you people over there.

5273
02:22:16,890 --> 02:22:17,030
Oh,

5274
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:17,351
we didn't.

5275
02:22:17,351 --> 02:22:20,370
We don't really get offended by geography.

5276
02:22:20,460 --> 02:22:21,360
We don't know.

5277
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:22,860
We don't know who your king is.

5278
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:23,941
There's a lot of shit.

5279
02:22:23,941 --> 02:22:24,601
We don't know.

5280
02:22:24,601 --> 02:22:25,620
Kings are cool.

5281
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:27,060
I wish we had a king better than it.

5282
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:27,150
Yeah.

5283
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,260
What the fuck we got now?

5284
02:22:28,261 --> 02:22:30,330
I don't think they have
tried this in the God damn.

5285
02:22:30,380 --> 02:22:31,080
Eddie's upset.

5286
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:31,913
I don't think Ireland,

5287
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:35,070
Ireland doesn't have kings.

5288
02:22:35,730 --> 02:22:36,563
I don't think so.

5289
02:22:36,670 --> 02:22:36,940
I don't know.

5290
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:37,500
Right.

5291
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:42,500
I wish I knew you all sound like
complete princes and collab queens.

5292
02:22:42,980 --> 02:22:45,200
They're going to show the Brad
Pickett Uri Alcantara fight.

5293
02:22:45,201 --> 02:22:49,010
This is a one round spoiler alert is the
official name in case you know you can

5294
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:50,340
have Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

5295
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:52,220
Okay.

5296
02:22:52,220 --> 02:22:53,330
Official name of the UK is now,

5297
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:55,680
I can't even break Great
Britain and Northern Ireland,

5298
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:58,950
but I thought Ireland in Northern Ireland
would like pretty much United now.

5299
02:22:59,000 --> 02:22:59,550
Hey Bro.

5300
02:22:59,550 --> 02:23:00,091
So England,

5301
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:00,571
Scotland,

5302
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:02,340
Wales and Ireland or the United Kingdom.

5303
02:23:03,020 --> 02:23:03,570
Hmm.

5304
02:23:03,570 --> 02:23:04,403
Okay.

5305
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:07,890
Although most of Ireland
is now independent.

5306
02:23:08,160 --> 02:23:08,993
Interesting.

5307
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:10,500
Huh?

5308
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:12,570
Irish people are just
clowning us right now.

5309
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:13,051
Yeah.

5310
02:23:13,051 --> 02:23:13,471
They're like,

5311
02:23:13,471 --> 02:23:13,681
hey,

5312
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:14,251
down down,

5313
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:15,270
shit about us.

5314
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:18,090
He can't even do a fucking Irish accent.

5315
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:19,320
Joey couldn't tell him.

5316
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:20,400
Could do an Irish accent.

5317
02:23:20,401 --> 02:23:20,850
Kenny,

5318
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:22,230
he could do Conor McGregor.

5319
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:23,700
Kenny didn't,

5320
02:23:23,780 --> 02:23:26,430
didn't you just do Joey doing
Conor McGregor be taught?

5321
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:29,300
Probably did it Yuri for good.

5322
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:30,900
I forgot to click in do Joey.

5323
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,310
That's one of the funny shit.

5324
02:23:32,580 --> 02:23:33,420
Oh Shit.

5325
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:35,310
Uri Alcantara all over.

5326
02:23:35,311 --> 02:23:36,180
Brad Pickett.

5327
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:38,940
Brad pickets at some
goddamned wars in his career.

5328
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:40,080
Did there Brad Pickett.

5329
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,033
Uh,

5330
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:42,210
who did he knock out?

5331
02:23:42,390 --> 02:23:42,661
Well,

5332
02:23:42,661 --> 02:23:43,494
he heard me.

5333
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:43,920
He hurt.

5334
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:44,071
Well,

5335
02:23:44,071 --> 02:23:45,080
he's knocked out a bunch of old,

5336
02:23:45,090 --> 02:23:46,140
but he's knocked out a big,

5337
02:23:46,290 --> 02:23:47,250
big time dude.

5338
02:23:47,570 --> 02:23:49,260
That that would surprise you.

5339
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:52,410
Was it Ben of eating in the
order that would surprise you?

5340
02:23:52,770 --> 02:23:53,603
Who Was it?

5341
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,451
Big Time Guy.

5342
02:23:54,451 --> 02:23:55,251
Can you bring that up Jay?

5343
02:23:55,251 --> 02:23:56,660
He didn't knock out Benevidez right.

5344
02:23:56,920 --> 02:23:58,770
Knock out Benevidez was mighty mouse.

5345
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,380
Did he knock down mighty mouse?

5346
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:02,633
I don't think so.

5347
02:24:03,630 --> 02:24:03,991
No.

5348
02:24:03,991 --> 02:24:04,680
I don't think so.

5349
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:05,071
No.

5350
02:24:05,071 --> 02:24:07,740
A Brad Pickett knocked
someone the fuck out.

5351
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:08,640
See if you can find out.

5352
02:24:08,641 --> 02:24:09,510
Brad pickets.

5353
02:24:10,060 --> 02:24:10,770
WC.

5354
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,840
Oh,

5355
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:14,670
please.

5356
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,330
Got An analyst.

5357
02:24:15,330 --> 02:24:17,460
Or is it an empowered to the temple?

5358
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:19,340
Nasty hunches.

5359
02:24:19,730 --> 02:24:20,431
Cut that on,

5360
02:24:20,431 --> 02:24:21,020
uh,

5361
02:24:21,020 --> 02:24:22,560
on super slow Mo.

5362
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:24,420
Nasty ground and pound.

5363
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,141
I see what he's doing.

5364
02:24:25,141 --> 02:24:25,640
He's Gassy.

5365
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:26,161
He's never,

5366
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:27,690
he never went to his knees.

5367
02:24:27,691 --> 02:24:28,680
He passed standing.

5368
02:24:29,790 --> 02:24:30,720
Now he's on his knees.

5369
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:34,050
Once he passes or that beautiful
and get on his knees to leave pet.

5370
02:24:34,051 --> 02:24:34,461
Beautiful.

5371
02:24:34,461 --> 02:24:37,660
Now look at this standing triangle,

5372
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:38,850
triangle,

5373
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:39,683
triangle,

5374
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:40,710
rap kid

5375
02:24:42,430 --> 02:24:43,263
Armbar I,

5376
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:44,373
oh

5377
02:24:45,790 --> 02:24:46,623
my God.

5378
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:50,010
Look at this beautiful,

5379
02:24:50,370 --> 02:24:51,000
beautiful.

5380
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:52,450
Pick it on the head.

5381
02:24:52,980 --> 02:24:53,813
Beautiful.

5382
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:54,770
Amazing battle.

5383
02:24:55,360 --> 02:24:57,180
He's supposed to look just like that.

5384
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,560
It's supposed to look just like that.

5385
02:24:58,561 --> 02:24:59,900
We need a highlight reel of that.

5386
02:25:00,100 --> 02:25:01,020
That's pretty stunning.

5387
02:25:01,090 --> 02:25:02,700
You're average at the school.

5388
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:03,810
That happens all the time.

5389
02:25:04,050 --> 02:25:04,883
Keep going down.

5390
02:25:04,890 --> 02:25:06,050
Keep going down to look.

5391
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,661
Look up left.

5392
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:07,920
That's his record right there.

5393
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:09,690
She keep going to hell for me.

5394
02:25:09,691 --> 02:25:09,871
It's,

5395
02:25:09,871 --> 02:25:11,430
it's one that to surprise you.

5396
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:15,190
Who's already all the
way down to 2007 gone.

5397
02:25:15,480 --> 02:25:16,570
Damn God.

5398
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:17,730
Hold.

5399
02:25:17,820 --> 02:25:18,510
Let me see.

5400
02:25:18,510 --> 02:25:19,290
Am I bad chick?

5401
02:25:19,290 --> 02:25:20,260
That's Brad Pickett.

5402
02:25:20,280 --> 02:25:20,490
Yeah.

5403
02:25:20,490 --> 02:25:20,881
Hold on.

5404
02:25:20,881 --> 02:25:21,990
I'm thinking about someone else.

5405
02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:22,410
No,

5406
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:23,280
I'm missing one

5407
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:25,013
here.

5408
02:25:25,090 --> 02:25:25,923
Uh

5409
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:30,680
Oh by the city's just Johnson pay.

5410
02:25:30,830 --> 02:25:31,540
Interesting.

5411
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:32,770
2006 years ago.

5412
02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:34,723
How crazy.

5413
02:25:34,750 --> 02:25:35,583
You don't think about it.

5414
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:37,560
Years ago he knew it.

5415
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:40,210
I got knocked out but I
know what your big win.

5416
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,573
Big Win.

5417
02:25:43,340 --> 02:25:44,173
It's a crazy way.

5418
02:25:44,210 --> 02:25:45,250
It's a motherfucker.

5419
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:45,521
Yeah.

5420
02:25:45,521 --> 02:25:47,380
Well he's a really good
striker is Brazilian.

5421
02:25:47,381 --> 02:25:51,060
So break this shit up every effort.

5422
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:52,600
So Dominick Cruz,

5423
02:25:52,810 --> 02:25:53,950
powerful Alpha brain,

5424
02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:55,800
bringing that out of my bed.

5425
02:25:57,870 --> 02:25:58,361
Kell Brook,

5426
02:25:58,361 --> 02:25:59,800
we could not remember kelp off.

5427
02:25:59,801 --> 02:26:01,530
Both of us try,

5428
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:02,700
tries dust.

5429
02:26:02,701 --> 02:26:04,450
God not searching for water.

5430
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:09,480
I was just looking for something just
that happens so often to me man here in

5431
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:11,821
like when does it get it?

5432
02:26:11,821 --> 02:26:16,821
Like obviously I'm 49 and obviously my
brain is not going to work in 40 years.

5433
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:20,290
Like when I'm 89 for
sure it's going to suck.

5434
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:21,830
So like when does it start?

5435
02:26:22,490 --> 02:26:23,710
Is it going to start next year?

5436
02:26:23,740 --> 02:26:25,450
Keep up with the Alpha brain.

5437
02:26:25,450 --> 02:26:25,701
Ma'Am,

5438
02:26:25,701 --> 02:26:29,320
I'm doing my best but it's
not going to work 300 years.

5439
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:34,760
Technology 96 and he was still speaking
like he was 29 but technology might

5440
02:26:36,610 --> 02:26:37,151
advance,

5441
02:26:37,151 --> 02:26:39,150
you know and help your brain
and never know what did,

5442
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:41,170
you could put Jack
Daniels versus technology.

5443
02:26:42,180 --> 02:26:43,630
You can put your brain.

5444
02:26:43,631 --> 02:26:44,290
They figured out,

5445
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:45,850
they haven't figured out
how to put a bus stop,

5446
02:26:46,820 --> 02:26:51,820
but they did figure out how to take your
brain and put it in some shit and keep

5447
02:26:51,971 --> 02:26:53,160
you alive so that you're alive.

5448
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:53,981
You just can't move.

5449
02:26:53,981 --> 02:26:58,660
You're just your brain where
it should read this and

5450
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:03,010
they could keep you alive.

5451
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:05,580
Pop up on that tower seven website I said,

5452
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:06,483
I said

5453
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:15,280
take your brain out and keep your on
your brain where you could actually make

5454
02:27:15,281 --> 02:27:16,570
shit happen with just your brain.

5455
02:27:16,571 --> 02:27:17,110
We figured,

5456
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,231
no,

5457
02:27:17,231 --> 02:27:18,064
I don't want that.

5458
02:27:18,880 --> 02:27:21,340
They haven't figured out how to take
your brain and put it on another body

5459
02:27:21,341 --> 02:27:22,150
because it was common.

5460
02:27:22,150 --> 02:27:23,320
They're doing some experiments.

5461
02:27:23,321 --> 02:27:28,210
Would you do it 80 class when I was a
hundred I was got to do while you are

5462
02:27:28,211 --> 02:27:28,810
alive.

5463
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:31,510
Piece of basically you got to commit
suicide and then they have you and your

5464
02:27:31,511 --> 02:27:32,344
brain.

5465
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:34,260
You're in the hospital and
then they got pretty hard.

5466
02:27:34,690 --> 02:27:37,000
They have to be like brain from
teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.

5467
02:27:37,020 --> 02:27:37,811
You have to be that guy.

5468
02:27:37,811 --> 02:27:42,220
I think just something they have like a
map of the future laid out and you have

5469
02:27:42,221 --> 02:27:43,720
to commit to this map of the future.

5470
02:27:43,721 --> 02:27:44,920
They've got to go look right now.

5471
02:27:44,950 --> 02:27:46,270
We can't put you in another body,

5472
02:27:46,390 --> 02:27:51,390
but what we can to keep your body in
this jail for at least three years before

5473
02:27:51,491 --> 02:27:53,550
we put you in another body and
you can still talk to your home.

5474
02:27:53,551 --> 02:27:54,680
You say we have it,

5475
02:27:57,190 --> 02:27:58,360
the brain and the body.

5476
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,930
He's got like a super robot

5477
02:28:01,730 --> 02:28:03,280
that was shredders main homie.

5478
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:06,270
That's what I'm talking about,

5479
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,740
but imagine if they said Look Gi,

5480
02:28:08,800 --> 02:28:12,070
what we've determined is that the brain
has to sustain this solution for three

5481
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:12,341
years.

5482
02:28:12,341 --> 02:28:13,510
So for three years you are,

5483
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:15,370
you are going to be trapped in this brain,

5484
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:16,510
but you'll stay alive.

5485
02:28:16,600 --> 02:28:21,010
You'll know that you're alive and you're
fucked and you don't know what it's

5486
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,853
going to be.

5487
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,500
We can come out after three years.

5488
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:27,380
We don't know how you're going to deal
with the fact that you couldn't talk.

5489
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:29,120
You couldn't tell anybody you were okay.

5490
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:34,300
He had to survive inside of this jar for
three years as a drain and electro with

5491
02:28:35,001 --> 02:28:37,190
an eye so that you could
see out your brain,

5492
02:28:37,460 --> 02:28:38,720
so you can't talk,

5493
02:28:38,721 --> 02:28:39,650
you can't communicate,

5494
02:28:39,740 --> 02:28:42,350
but the people that know your homeys,

5495
02:28:42,440 --> 02:28:43,580
when your family comes in,

5496
02:28:43,581 --> 02:28:45,140
they can just put on a fucking TV.

5497
02:28:45,141 --> 02:28:45,411
They go,

5498
02:28:45,411 --> 02:28:46,340
he loves this shit.

5499
02:28:46,640 --> 02:28:47,120
Boom.

5500
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:49,370
And they could see that that
the electric eye blinking,

5501
02:28:49,460 --> 02:28:54,460
bluish kind of paralyzed
for three years term.

5502
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:56,150
You're doing a jail term for three years.

5503
02:28:57,290 --> 02:28:59,570
If I was a hundred my balls
right down to the ground,

5504
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:00,404
my bad day,

5505
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:01,370
go do it.

5506
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:03,350
Girls at fall in love
with brains and chicken.

5507
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:06,980
He says he can't
communicate about his Mars.

5508
02:29:06,990 --> 02:29:07,900
No communicating,

5509
02:29:08,010 --> 02:29:08,810
can't communicate,

5510
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:12,440
but he can eventually the
smart motherfuckers can
communicate little by little

5511
02:29:15,530 --> 02:29:16,640
you're fucked up.

5512
02:29:16,641 --> 02:29:20,150
The movie evolution is
evolution and there's going
to be a couple of brains that

5513
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:22,100
can do clicks for yes or no.

5514
02:29:24,430 --> 02:29:25,020
My thought,

5515
02:29:25,020 --> 02:29:27,950
my thought is doing three
years in a bowl of Jello.

5516
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:28,641
When you come out,

5517
02:29:28,641 --> 02:29:33,000
we have to hope that you
can psychologically survive
the fact that three hour

5518
02:29:34,460 --> 02:29:35,150
talk.

5519
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:36,910
Do you have in your eyes?

5520
02:29:37,950 --> 02:29:40,340
I'm watching old lady going
to do for three years.

5521
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:45,400
Take Black Dick [inaudible] he wants,

5522
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:49,420
he just wants to see
people jerking Mongolians,

5523
02:29:49,660 --> 02:29:50,493
Mongols.

5524
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:55,290
They gonna come in and they're fucker
intense and you're watching and you can

5525
02:29:55,291 --> 02:29:56,061
tell by the brain,

5526
02:29:56,061 --> 02:29:59,560
aura and the color eastern bloc,

5527
02:30:02,690 --> 02:30:03,111
the brain,

5528
02:30:03,111 --> 02:30:03,944
just

5529
02:30:05,150 --> 02:30:07,660
eastern bloc due to
big giant square heads.

5530
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:09,800
Super aggressive with face tattoos.

5531
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:12,830
Wow.

5532
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:13,280
It's the,

5533
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:14,600
it's the frequency of the brain.

5534
02:30:15,580 --> 02:30:17,840
The Gremlin after midnight

5535
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:21,740
ruining my movie,

5536
02:30:22,250 --> 02:30:22,881
my movie,

5537
02:30:22,881 --> 02:30:23,920
the brain is just,

5538
02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:24,950
the torture is,

5539
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:26,780
there's just no way you
can express yourself.

5540
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:28,310
I'm not terrible.

5541
02:30:31,390 --> 02:30:32,360
They can't read your brain.

5542
02:30:32,361 --> 02:30:34,100
Your brain is in suspended animation.

5543
02:30:34,101 --> 02:30:34,720
Pulse,

5544
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:35,440
three years,

5545
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:38,930
blood rushing to it to
hope for three years.

5546
02:30:38,931 --> 02:30:41,820
It's in some sort of a biogen editor,

5547
02:30:42,170 --> 02:30:43,310
uh,

5548
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:44,270
uh,

5549
02:30:47,020 --> 02:30:47,853
bullshit.

5550
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:49,820
Can I sign up for

5551
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:51,830
you?

5552
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:52,800
Bring strippers and it's like,

5553
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:54,880
there's no coincidence.

5554
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:57,030
It's conspiracy.

5555
02:30:58,410 --> 02:30:59,370
And the skeptics like,

5556
02:30:59,440 --> 02:30:59,981
you don't know.

5557
02:30:59,981 --> 02:31:00,880
It's just the brain.

5558
02:31:03,060 --> 02:31:03,893
Drunks.

5559
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:05,320
Too many,

5560
02:31:05,320 --> 02:31:07,450
too many drinks after midnight.

5561
02:31:08,170 --> 02:31:09,430
Feed him after midnight.

5562
02:31:09,431 --> 02:31:11,520
So definitely making sense for sure.

5563
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:11,751
No,

5564
02:31:11,751 --> 02:31:12,584
it's so fresh.

5565
02:31:12,870 --> 02:31:12,970
Yeah.

5566
02:31:12,970 --> 02:31:15,280
I mean it's for anyone
has made sense ever.

5567
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:17,660
Okay,

5568
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:18,493
Brian,

5569
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:19,920
why are you with Joe?

5570
02:31:19,921 --> 02:31:20,070
Do

5571
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,903
you hate me?

5572
02:31:20,910 --> 02:31:21,100
You,

5573
02:31:21,100 --> 02:31:21,933
hey,

5574
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:28,620
listen,

5575
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:29,880
it's totally logical.

5576
02:31:30,130 --> 02:31:30,963
Okay,

5577
02:31:33,480 --> 02:31:34,560
here's the fucked up thing.

5578
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:36,380
If you do die right,

5579
02:31:36,450 --> 02:31:41,450
and they can take your brain and transfer
port it into another body and rig up

5580
02:31:41,821 --> 02:31:42,660
something for you.

5581
02:31:43,080 --> 02:31:47,190
What if we find out though
that death is not really death,

5582
02:31:47,520 --> 02:31:52,410
that all these ancient religions were on
to something is that death is a portal

5583
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:57,060
to another experience that you haven't
entered into yet and I was awesome.

5584
02:31:57,150 --> 02:31:57,983
I haven't done that,

5585
02:31:58,590 --> 02:32:00,030
but I've done DMT obviously,

5586
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:02,730
which is the main thing in Iowasca,

5587
02:32:02,731 --> 02:32:06,520
which is what your body produces
when you're done with someone else.

5588
02:32:06,810 --> 02:32:07,643
Someone else.

5589
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:11,250
You did five methodoxy DMT.

5590
02:32:11,420 --> 02:32:12,031
You know what,

5591
02:32:12,031 --> 02:32:17,031
and it was a very spiritual experience
and made me believes that there I believe

5592
02:32:17,371 --> 02:32:18,091
in a higher power.

5593
02:32:18,091 --> 02:32:18,960
I don't know what it is.

5594
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:20,520
I don't know if it's that bearded dude.

5595
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:22,060
I don't know if it's the olive dude.

5596
02:32:22,290 --> 02:32:23,880
I Dunno if it's the Jewish dude.

5597
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,580
I don't know if it's the
African dude or the Inca dude.

5598
02:32:26,610 --> 02:32:27,010
I didn't go there.

5599
02:32:27,010 --> 02:32:28,440
There's some kind of shit.

5600
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:31,260
There's some something in my opinion,

5601
02:32:31,261 --> 02:32:32,094
this is just my opinion.

5602
02:32:32,370 --> 02:32:34,220
Something created that created,

5603
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:35,790
there is a creator of some sort.

5604
02:32:35,850 --> 02:32:38,220
It could be a fucking
nerd computer simulation.

5605
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:40,830
People believed that everyone
believes in computer simulations.

5606
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:41,191
Oh,

5607
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:42,024
that could be true.

5608
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:43,190
Kneeled to grass.

5609
02:32:43,191 --> 02:32:44,520
Fucking Tyson says it.

5610
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:47,880
So that could be true that we're a
computer in a computer simulation.

5611
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:51,390
But when you start talking about
like a creator or a higher power,

5612
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:51,901
whatever,

5613
02:32:51,901 --> 02:32:52,734
God,

5614
02:32:54,310 --> 02:32:56,880
but a computer centers
are not following that

5615
02:32:59,060 --> 02:32:59,893
one.

5616
02:33:02,580 --> 02:33:05,520
I'm just saying that
fucking Neil degrasse Tyson,

5617
02:33:05,521 --> 02:33:09,330
he doesn't like him because he represents
absolute facts that can't be argued

5618
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:09,541
with.

5619
02:33:09,541 --> 02:33:11,580
And that Shit's dangerous
for a conspiracy theorist.

5620
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:13,020
If Neil walked in right now,

5621
02:33:13,021 --> 02:33:14,370
I would love it.

5622
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:16,170
Oh my God.

5623
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:20,730
How you know what I would do if Neil
degrasse Tyson walked in right now?

5624
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:21,870
Uh,

5625
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:23,890
what would you do to make a mind fuck you?

5626
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:26,250
He would choke your mind.

5627
02:33:26,270 --> 02:33:27,600
Eti you choke your mind,

5628
02:33:28,310 --> 02:33:29,570
your mind and electric.

5629
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:30,630
You're talking about the moon.

5630
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:32,840
And then I would listen
to him talk about the,

5631
02:33:32,841 --> 02:33:34,500
how we actually went to the moon.

5632
02:33:34,590 --> 02:33:35,423
And I would,

5633
02:33:35,470 --> 02:33:36,303
uh,

5634
02:33:36,350 --> 02:33:37,620
I enjoy that.

5635
02:33:37,960 --> 02:33:38,250
Hey,

5636
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:39,150
so what was your point?

5637
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:40,710
I don't remember now.

5638
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:41,693
It was,

5639
02:33:43,470 --> 02:33:44,700
it was about if you die,

5640
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:46,600
what chapter yet?

5641
02:33:47,010 --> 02:33:49,350
Another portal is that we don't know.

5642
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:50,040
Look,

5643
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:51,000
I've said this before,

5644
02:33:51,001 --> 02:33:51,834
but I'll say it again.

5645
02:33:52,770 --> 02:33:54,060
Nobody's scared to sleep,

5646
02:33:54,360 --> 02:33:55,470
but everybody's scared to die.

5647
02:33:56,370 --> 02:33:56,611
No,

5648
02:33:56,611 --> 02:33:57,660
everybody wants to go to sleep.

5649
02:33:57,720 --> 02:33:58,381
Everybody does.

5650
02:33:58,381 --> 02:34:00,780
We look forward to it and we
look forward to shutting off.

5651
02:34:00,781 --> 02:34:02,100
Cause we know that we're
going to come back.

5652
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:06,120
But everybody's terrified of death
and we don't understand sleep.

5653
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:07,470
We don't know why we need it.

5654
02:34:07,471 --> 02:34:08,850
We don't know what the fuck happens.

5655
02:34:08,851 --> 02:34:10,110
We don't know what dreams are.

5656
02:34:10,111 --> 02:34:13,800
We don't understand what
kind of psychedelic chemicals
are being produced by our

5657
02:34:13,801 --> 02:34:15,660
own brains while we're out cold.

5658
02:34:15,661 --> 02:34:16,920
We don't know what the experience is.

5659
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:20,680
We know we come back with crazy
memories and some people are capable of

5660
02:34:20,681 --> 02:34:24,280
manipulating those memories
or manipulating that
experience and they have lucid

5661
02:34:24,281 --> 02:34:25,114
dreaming.

5662
02:34:25,330 --> 02:34:26,470
I have to just,

5663
02:34:26,710 --> 02:34:27,010
I,

5664
02:34:27,010 --> 02:34:30,760
I've had brief moments of lucid
dreaming and I've never put any effort

5665
02:34:30,940 --> 02:34:33,130
whatsoever into trying to get good at it.

5666
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:34,720
But I know that some people do.

5667
02:34:34,721 --> 02:34:36,250
And they concentrate on it all the time.

5668
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,113
I've done it.

5669
02:34:37,660 --> 02:34:38,230
I'm sure.

5670
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:39,063
I'm sure you have.

5671
02:34:39,130 --> 02:34:40,230
My point is,

5672
02:34:40,630 --> 02:34:40,871
yeah,

5673
02:34:40,871 --> 02:34:41,560
there's a lot,

5674
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:43,570
but my point is we don't know what it is.

5675
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:45,190
We don't know what death is.

5676
02:34:45,191 --> 02:34:45,820
We don't know.

5677
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:50,380
We were so convinced that this state
of being awake is the only state that

5678
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:51,214
exists,

5679
02:34:51,310 --> 02:34:54,580
but we already know of another state
that we have no evidence when we,

5680
02:34:54,581 --> 02:34:55,690
when we are alive.

5681
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:56,830
When you're walking through life,

5682
02:34:56,831 --> 02:34:57,790
you watch the UFC,

5683
02:34:57,791 --> 02:34:58,780
you're driving your car.

5684
02:34:58,960 --> 02:35:03,130
You have no fucking idea what was
going on for eight hours of your day.

5685
02:35:03,310 --> 02:35:04,143
You don't.

5686
02:35:04,240 --> 02:35:05,110
You wake up,

5687
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:06,610
oh my alarm clock went up.

5688
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:07,900
Time to get up.

5689
02:35:08,050 --> 02:35:08,620
You have,

5690
02:35:08,620 --> 02:35:13,620
you have evidence based on a few fucking
slide shows of ridiculousness that took

5691
02:35:16,571 --> 02:35:18,610
place in your imagination.

5692
02:35:18,611 --> 02:35:21,670
Air quotes in the last
eight fucking hours.

5693
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,800
We're not talking about
five minutes of your day.

5694
02:35:23,920 --> 02:35:26,590
We're talking about eight
fucking hours of your day.

5695
02:35:26,590 --> 02:35:28,600
We have to shut your head off.

5696
02:35:28,810 --> 02:35:28,981
What?

5697
02:35:28,981 --> 02:35:31,690
You literally have no idea
what's going on around you.

5698
02:35:31,810 --> 02:35:33,880
You have no idea.

5699
02:35:33,881 --> 02:35:38,500
You have faith that you're going to wake
up cause you woken up every other day

5700
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:39,610
for your whole life.

5701
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:44,420
That alone is fucking bizarre that you
would have any confidence whatsoever.

5702
02:35:44,421 --> 02:35:48,970
It's what happens when you die and that
you could tell me that you know for sure

5703
02:35:48,971 --> 02:35:51,520
you don't know what the fuck
happens when you go to sleep.

5704
02:35:51,521 --> 02:35:52,230
Bitch,

5705
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:56,860
you don't have a damn clue as to what the
fuck happens when your eyes are closed

5706
02:35:56,861 --> 02:35:57,780
and you're [inaudible]

5707
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:00,160
to die.

5708
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:02,740
Something has to what's
going on in your brain.

5709
02:36:02,770 --> 02:36:03,491
We don't know.

5710
02:36:03,491 --> 02:36:04,390
We don't know.

5711
02:36:04,470 --> 02:36:05,230
It's this.

5712
02:36:05,230 --> 02:36:10,230
We're all basing on our
rudimentary understanding of
normal awake consciousness,

5713
02:36:11,141 --> 02:36:15,070
which for a guy like me that's on a
brain scientist or you or anybody in this

5714
02:36:15,071 --> 02:36:15,580
room,

5715
02:36:15,580 --> 02:36:16,990
we don't fucking know.

5716
02:36:17,140 --> 02:36:21,250
We barely understand consciousness
on the highest levels of science.

5717
02:36:21,251 --> 02:36:23,560
They barely understand
what consciousness is.

5718
02:36:23,561 --> 02:36:24,010
There's,

5719
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:28,390
there's arguments as to what causes it
this August arguments as to what defines

5720
02:36:28,391 --> 02:36:28,790
it,

5721
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:30,820
which is it does a plant consciousness.

5722
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:34,000
Plants can detect it when
animals are chewing next to them,

5723
02:36:34,150 --> 02:36:35,040
plants they,

5724
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:38,590
they excrete certain chemicals to
make themselves tastes like shit.

5725
02:36:38,591 --> 02:36:41,680
When they hear caterpillar
sounds from a tape recorder.

5726
02:36:41,800 --> 02:36:42,760
Is that conscious?

5727
02:36:42,850 --> 02:36:43,211
No.

5728
02:36:43,211 --> 02:36:43,720
Okay.

5729
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,620
What about a dog?

5730
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,540
My dog knows when I'm
pulling into the driveway,

5731
02:36:46,541 --> 02:36:47,380
he starts barking.

5732
02:36:47,381 --> 02:36:48,490
He gets excited to see me.

5733
02:36:48,491 --> 02:36:49,390
Is he conscious?

5734
02:36:49,590 --> 02:36:49,930
No.

5735
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:50,890
Venus fly trap.

5736
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:52,130
Exactly.

5737
02:36:52,130 --> 02:36:54,190
Or how about those ones in
the Amazon and eat rats?

5738
02:36:54,310 --> 02:36:55,130
They got this crazy.

5739
02:36:55,130 --> 02:36:56,410
Feels like a trumpet.

5740
02:36:56,590 --> 02:36:57,750
A rat falls into it.

5741
02:36:57,760 --> 02:36:59,040
It dissolves the rat.

5742
02:36:59,240 --> 02:36:59,620
He's like,

5743
02:36:59,620 --> 02:36:59,860
bitch,

5744
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:01,930
you never get now a
little shop of horrors.

5745
02:37:01,931 --> 02:37:02,470
Yeah.

5746
02:37:02,470 --> 02:37:06,130
This fucking all kinds of crazy shit
that you can say that part plant put

5747
02:37:06,131 --> 02:37:06,580
animals,

5748
02:37:06,580 --> 02:37:07,301
uneasiness lunch.

5749
02:37:07,301 --> 02:37:07,600
Right?

5750
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:09,400
Remember on TV when I was a kid,

5751
02:37:09,401 --> 02:37:10,690
you could order that shit.

5752
02:37:10,810 --> 02:37:11,321
That was though.

5753
02:37:11,321 --> 02:37:12,590
He's still a little mercial.

5754
02:37:12,600 --> 02:37:14,050
Still get those and it's still fine.

5755
02:37:14,210 --> 02:37:15,043
I still buy it.

5756
02:37:17,710 --> 02:37:19,700
It on Valentine's Day.

5757
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:20,370
Uh,

5758
02:37:20,370 --> 02:37:23,480
two dozen Dina's flight
tracker should I believe?

5759
02:37:23,481 --> 02:37:26,030
I think I had one ex wife.

5760
02:37:26,031 --> 02:37:27,890
That shit right there.

5761
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:29,023
Dope Dude.

5762
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:30,740
The eat flies in your house.

5763
02:37:31,250 --> 02:37:32,061
Leave the window open.

5764
02:37:32,061 --> 02:37:32,451
Come on in,

5765
02:37:32,451 --> 02:37:33,250
bitch.

5766
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:35,330
You don't pull it all fucking shit.

5767
02:37:35,331 --> 02:37:37,740
What is a big sign and
fly trap number recorded?

5768
02:37:37,741 --> 02:37:38,271
Can you imagine?

5769
02:37:38,271 --> 02:37:40,400
One like little shop of horrors.

5770
02:37:40,401 --> 02:37:42,180
Remember that she had AP move?

5771
02:37:42,200 --> 02:37:43,040
Was that based on,

5772
02:37:43,300 --> 02:37:44,210
what was he rapping?

5773
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:45,170
The Cuny people,

5774
02:37:45,171 --> 02:37:45,501
of course,

5775
02:37:45,501 --> 02:37:47,750
it could be something like if you
went back to the dinosaur days,

5776
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:51,740
I guarantee there's all sorts of plants
that were eating shit that slipped up.

5777
02:37:51,741 --> 02:37:56,050
We're sure eating like ancient Rome or
wherever the fuck there was around 65

5778
02:37:56,050 --> 02:37:56,391
million years.

5779
02:37:56,391 --> 02:37:58,540
Lost Line of source.

5780
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:02,360
Do you think that's just the same guy
that thinks that the earth is flat?

5781
02:38:02,690 --> 02:38:05,690
You put out a video about dinosaurs
being fake problem with that.

5782
02:38:05,690 --> 02:38:06,920
Of course we have bones.

5783
02:38:06,921 --> 02:38:08,320
There's false shit load of them.

5784
02:38:09,250 --> 02:38:09,550
All of them,

5785
02:38:09,550 --> 02:38:10,540
like in the museums,

5786
02:38:10,590 --> 02:38:14,200
there's a lot of them are bad
and they fell out of them,

5787
02:38:14,260 --> 02:38:15,093
but that's not true.

5788
02:38:15,170 --> 02:38:15,381
See,

5789
02:38:15,381 --> 02:38:16,160
here's the thing.

5790
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,080
When you look in at a fossil,

5791
02:38:18,110 --> 02:38:21,110
well you're looking at is not
necessarily really a bone.

5792
02:38:21,290 --> 02:38:26,210
What it is is we're minerals have taken
place of where the bone used to be,

5793
02:38:26,211 --> 02:38:27,380
what a fossilized like.

5794
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:29,300
Have you ever see a megalodon tooth,

5795
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:31,610
like a shark tooth on discovery channel?

5796
02:38:31,640 --> 02:38:34,750
Mack Bud Brotzmann had one on his office.

5797
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:36,140
Remember we had that conversation,

5798
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:37,460
we had a conversation about it,

5799
02:38:37,580 --> 02:38:39,770
and bud was telling me that
this is a mega don tooth,

5800
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:40,481
and I said,

5801
02:38:40,481 --> 02:38:41,510
it's sort of,

5802
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:43,550
it is kind of a mega don tooth,

5803
02:38:43,551 --> 02:38:45,710
but it really is a fossil of mega don to,

5804
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:49,010
what that means is over millions
and millions and millions of years,

5805
02:38:49,310 --> 02:38:54,310
the actual tooth itself is changed by
the ground and it's becomes mineralized

5806
02:38:55,430 --> 02:38:56,990
and it becomes like a rock.

5807
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:59,660
So it's the shape of a megalodon tooth,

5808
02:38:59,870 --> 02:39:03,290
but it's not exactly the same as
it was in the Mega Don's mouth.

5809
02:39:03,570 --> 02:39:05,010
So years ago.

5810
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:08,000
The actual shape,

5811
02:39:08,260 --> 02:39:09,093
the shape of it,

5812
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:10,510
but it's not a tooth.

5813
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,361
Do you remember,

5814
02:39:11,361 --> 02:39:12,710
do a DNA test on it?

5815
02:39:12,711 --> 02:39:13,610
It's a fossil.

5816
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:15,183
It's weed.

5817
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:19,910
And you were a kid that
oil came from dinosaurs.

5818
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:20,451
Do you remember that?

5819
02:39:20,451 --> 02:39:20,810
She had,

5820
02:39:20,810 --> 02:39:22,780
that's what they used to fossil fuels.

5821
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:24,771
Hey Man,

5822
02:39:24,771 --> 02:39:26,830
there's a guy who worked on that.

5823
02:39:26,831 --> 02:39:28,160
JFK Administration.

5824
02:39:28,161 --> 02:39:33,161
He was the chief of special operations
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the

5825
02:39:35,330 --> 02:39:36,590
JFK administration.

5826
02:39:36,770 --> 02:39:40,550
His name is l Fletcher
Prouty proudy l Fletcher.

5827
02:39:40,551 --> 02:39:41,150
Prouty.

5828
02:39:41,150 --> 02:39:42,570
Look that dude up and when you,

5829
02:39:42,610 --> 02:39:43,940
what he says about oil,

5830
02:39:44,030 --> 02:39:46,490
Holy Shit with that dude says a bottle.

5831
02:39:46,700 --> 02:39:47,533
He said,

5832
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:48,583
this is what he said.

5833
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:49,580
I don't know if it's true.

5834
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:50,840
I'm not a geologist,

5835
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:51,950
I'm not an oil.

5836
02:39:52,010 --> 02:39:55,370
He says that a peak oil,

5837
02:39:55,430 --> 02:39:58,790
like the scare that we're going
to run out of oil is perpetrated.

5838
02:39:58,791 --> 02:40:01,760
That's it is perpetrated
by the oil industry.

5839
02:40:01,761 --> 02:40:05,240
Says oil is the second most
abundant liquid in the world,

5840
02:40:05,241 --> 02:40:06,490
and oils everywhere.

5841
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:07,670
We'll never run out of it.

5842
02:40:08,030 --> 02:40:08,660
But if,

5843
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:11,750
if the people knew that then
they wouldn't pay the prices.

5844
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:13,920
They have to keep to keep the prices high.

5845
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:15,840
They have to give it.

5846
02:40:15,841 --> 02:40:17,160
This is what this dude said.

5847
02:40:17,190 --> 02:40:18,000
He might be right.

5848
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:18,450
But there's something,

5849
02:40:18,450 --> 02:40:21,090
there was a really interesting book
that I read that I'm thinking about this

5850
02:40:21,091 --> 02:40:22,780
today because today I was thrown some,

5851
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:26,050
I was given some books away actually to
goodwill and we're putting them in boxes

5852
02:40:26,051 --> 02:40:27,600
of books that I've read that
I'm not going to read again.

5853
02:40:27,840 --> 02:40:31,470
And one of them was black
gold stranglehold and there's
a really controversial

5854
02:40:31,471 --> 02:40:32,190
book that I read.

5855
02:40:32,190 --> 02:40:33,240
I don't remember who wrote it.

5856
02:40:33,241 --> 02:40:33,571
Jamie,

5857
02:40:33,571 --> 02:40:34,404
see if you could pull that up,

5858
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:39,590
but it was by a guy who was saying that
oil is actually a natural process and

5859
02:40:39,601 --> 02:40:43,500
it's a natural process of the earth and
that the idea that it was created by

5860
02:40:43,501 --> 02:40:44,430
fossils or,

5861
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:46,830
and then later the theory was that plants,

5862
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:49,800
plants like rotting would create this oil.

5863
02:40:50,010 --> 02:40:54,030
He said it's a natural process of the
earth itself and it's constantly renewing.

5864
02:40:54,330 --> 02:40:55,260
It does kind of make sense,

5865
02:40:55,261 --> 02:40:55,760
right?

5866
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,270
That's an l but you're proud of that.

5867
02:40:57,271 --> 02:40:58,170
He also said this to,

5868
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:03,320
he said the reason we think it's a
fossil fuel is because there John d

5869
02:41:03,720 --> 02:41:06,710
Rockefeller in 1890 2 cent a PA,

5870
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:10,590
a group of paid off scientists
to this big scientific community,

5871
02:41:10,800 --> 02:41:15,450
a committee on our organic matter in
Geneva in 1892 he sent these scientists

5872
02:41:15,540 --> 02:41:20,540
just so that they can put
in that petroleum is organic
and it contains hydrogen,

5873
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:21,630
oxygen and carbon,

5874
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:23,850
so he knew that if they pass that,

5875
02:41:23,940 --> 02:41:24,420
then if it's,

5876
02:41:24,420 --> 02:41:25,170
if they could,

5877
02:41:25,170 --> 02:41:27,240
if he can say the petroleum
is organic matter,

5878
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:29,520
then people will believe
that it's going to run out.

5879
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:31,560
But it was all a complete hoax.

5880
02:41:31,561 --> 02:41:32,790
That's what El Fletcher Prouty.

5881
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:33,683
You can get that book.

5882
02:41:33,690 --> 02:41:35,870
Here's dollars cheaper,

5883
02:41:35,910 --> 02:41:36,743
shared

5884
02:41:38,850 --> 02:41:39,571
oil,

5885
02:41:39,571 --> 02:41:42,390
trillions of gallons of oils.

5886
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:44,310
A burst it up all over the world,

5887
02:41:44,430 --> 02:41:46,860
but you won't see it in
American media because they,

5888
02:41:47,070 --> 02:41:49,650
they want everyone to think
that it's not abundance.

5889
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:50,520
It's so cheap.

5890
02:41:50,521 --> 02:41:55,521
We have so much oil in Alaska and all
over the United States that it's cheaper

5891
02:41:55,650 --> 02:41:57,270
just to get it from the Middle East.

5892
02:41:57,271 --> 02:41:58,140
It's so much cheaper,

5893
02:41:58,141 --> 02:42:00,810
just like a cheaper to make products
and China then to make it here.

5894
02:42:00,811 --> 02:42:01,644
We can make it here,

5895
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:04,290
but it's way cheaper to just
fucking make it a child on a second.

5896
02:42:04,291 --> 02:42:07,900
Do you know that most of the oil that
we get is actually from fracking now and

5897
02:42:07,970 --> 02:42:10,700
then Millie says not where
we get most of our or

5898
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:15,210
changing now that that's
part of his issue changing.

5899
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:17,010
It's a big issue with fracking,

5900
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:18,810
but according to this dude,

5901
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:19,560
if you'd look at,

5902
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:20,760
see that's the problem.

5903
02:42:20,761 --> 02:42:22,200
It's if it's one guy,

5904
02:42:22,440 --> 02:42:23,011
five minutes,

5905
02:42:23,011 --> 02:42:23,680
he talks about it,

5906
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:25,360
but there's no way we're watching that.

5907
02:42:25,380 --> 02:42:25,951
I'll fucking,

5908
02:42:25,951 --> 02:42:26,940
my head will explode.

5909
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:32,580
Finding out now he might be
right [inaudible] going on.

5910
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,770
It's possible you don't
want to hear that possible.

5911
02:42:34,771 --> 02:42:37,410
But if the case wouldn't you think,

5912
02:42:37,650 --> 02:42:38,460
here's the thing,

5913
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:43,460
it's entirely possible that the myth
of the earth creating oil through dead

5914
02:42:43,501 --> 02:42:46,170
things and it being a
limited resource is possible.

5915
02:42:46,171 --> 02:42:47,460
And the reason why we know it's possible,

5916
02:42:47,610 --> 02:42:51,000
it's because whenever there's money
to be made by manipulating the facts,

5917
02:42:51,150 --> 02:42:52,950
there's a bunch of people
that are willing to do that.

5918
02:42:52,951 --> 02:42:57,180
And what we know about the most recent
history is that the sugar industry paid

5919
02:42:57,181 --> 02:43:02,181
scientists untold amounts of money to
lie and say that saturated fats were the

5920
02:43:03,271 --> 02:43:06,870
cause of heart disease and that
take the blame off of sugar.

5921
02:43:07,350 --> 02:43:08,310
And this is a really,

5922
02:43:08,311 --> 02:43:10,380
this is a really recent study,

5923
02:43:10,710 --> 02:43:13,090
are recent rather a revelation.

5924
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:15,790
I'm we're talking within the last
couple of weeks documentary's called

5925
02:43:15,950 --> 02:43:16,783
sugarcoated.

5926
02:43:16,840 --> 02:43:17,710
Write that shit down.

5927
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:19,130
Sugarcoat it on Netflix.

5928
02:43:19,390 --> 02:43:23,620
You'll see the scientists from Harvard,

5929
02:43:23,740 --> 02:43:24,460
Yale.

5930
02:43:24,460 --> 02:43:28,240
So when you find this out thanking the
tobacco d the same thing when you hear

5931
02:43:28,241 --> 02:43:29,320
about tobacco science.

5932
02:43:29,410 --> 02:43:31,210
Tobacco science has paid off science,

5933
02:43:31,360 --> 02:43:32,051
Harvard,

5934
02:43:32,051 --> 02:43:32,740
Yale,

5935
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:33,700
because they know people bullied.

5936
02:43:33,701 --> 02:43:35,260
Cause most people walk
around and they'd go,

5937
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:36,213
Oh man,

5938
02:43:36,220 --> 02:43:37,510
I'm into science bro.

5939
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,470
I'm into science.

5940
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:39,400
They know that.

5941
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:39,641
They're like,

5942
02:43:39,641 --> 02:43:40,031
okay,

5943
02:43:40,031 --> 02:43:40,870
you're in the science.

5944
02:43:41,020 --> 02:43:41,853
We're going to pay.

5945
02:43:41,990 --> 02:43:46,810
They know they're going to pay off the
scientist so we could fool these gullible

5946
02:43:46,811 --> 02:43:47,530
motherfuckers.

5947
02:43:47,530 --> 02:43:48,311
That's what's going on.

5948
02:43:48,311 --> 02:43:49,350
Everyone's getting goalable.

5949
02:43:49,380 --> 02:43:50,071
Hold on a second.

5950
02:43:50,071 --> 02:43:51,400
Let's see what's getting fooled left.

5951
02:43:51,401 --> 02:43:52,234
There's bright,

5952
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:53,980
I can't see it as a
camera in the way here.

5953
02:43:53,981 --> 02:43:54,671
Can you scroll up?

5954
02:43:54,671 --> 02:43:55,230
Please?

5955
02:43:55,230 --> 02:43:58,930
Says oil prices were about 60%
lower than they were two years ago.

5956
02:43:58,931 --> 02:44:03,931
Yet BP reports us oil reserves are now
at an all time high up to 55 billion

5957
02:44:04,391 --> 02:44:04,871
barrels,

5958
02:44:04,871 --> 02:44:06,850
nearly double what we had 20 years ago.

5959
02:44:06,850 --> 02:44:10,690
This search demonstrates how even our
best experts are limited in their ability

5960
02:44:10,691 --> 02:44:14,290
to appreciate just how much
oil we have and can produce.

5961
02:44:14,680 --> 02:44:17,560
So it's entirely possible that
they were hoodwinked early on,

5962
02:44:17,561 --> 02:44:21,820
but it's also entirely possible that
they pretended they knew how the fuck oil

5963
02:44:21,821 --> 02:44:24,370
was created in a way that
it would benefit them.

5964
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:25,001
I did say,

5965
02:44:25,001 --> 02:44:25,260
Whoa,

5966
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,410
we have a limited supply.

5967
02:44:26,590 --> 02:44:29,560
So therefore we got to jet
remembering this in the 1970s man,

5968
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:31,540
when they fucked up our cars,

5969
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:34,390
we had the dopest fucking
muscle cars in the world,

5970
02:44:34,391 --> 02:44:35,740
like the American muscle cars,

5971
02:44:35,741 --> 02:44:37,150
the 1960s with a shit.

5972
02:44:37,270 --> 02:44:38,890
But then when Jimmy Carter got an office,

5973
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:40,060
they sense weakness.

5974
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:41,440
That was one of the fuckers Jack,

5975
02:44:41,441 --> 02:44:42,760
the oil rates up through the roof.

5976
02:44:42,850 --> 02:44:43,810
And because of that,

5977
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:46,270
we got mustangs that looked like dog shit.

5978
02:44:46,300 --> 02:44:47,150
Completely Golf.

5979
02:44:47,440 --> 02:44:49,070
Of course power such proudly,

5980
02:44:49,310 --> 02:44:49,870
proudly.

5981
02:44:49,870 --> 02:44:52,000
He said that was all part of the game.

5982
02:44:52,210 --> 02:44:56,770
Make it seem like there's a shortage
caused chaos in the United States.

5983
02:44:56,950 --> 02:44:58,930
It was all part of the program.

5984
02:44:59,050 --> 02:45:03,070
That's how they get the prices of
all a barrels show goddamn high.

5985
02:45:03,071 --> 02:45:06,150
If people knew that oil
was lever going to run out,

5986
02:45:06,160 --> 02:45:07,420
this is what l Fletcher Prouty said.

5987
02:45:07,570 --> 02:45:08,680
If this one dude though,

5988
02:45:08,681 --> 02:45:12,160
let's Fletcher Prouty debunk Google him.

5989
02:45:12,600 --> 02:45:12,910
Yeah,

5990
02:45:12,910 --> 02:45:14,260
just Google that bunch.

5991
02:45:17,890 --> 02:45:18,161
I mean,

5992
02:45:18,161 --> 02:45:18,820
you never know.

5993
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,360
Okay.

5994
02:45:19,360 --> 02:45:20,440
But you don't say,

5995
02:45:20,840 --> 02:45:24,220
maybe you'd want to know whether
he's right or whether he's crazy.

5996
02:45:24,221 --> 02:45:24,760
Right.

5997
02:45:24,760 --> 02:45:29,130
So it's good to find something
[inaudible] Kennedy assassinated.

5998
02:45:30,160 --> 02:45:30,821
You know you,

5999
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:31,750
you might be right.

6000
02:45:31,780 --> 02:45:32,700
You must be roles.

6001
02:45:32,880 --> 02:45:33,100
No,

6002
02:45:33,100 --> 02:45:37,120
you might be right or they might be
legitimate scientists that are proposing a

6003
02:45:37,121 --> 02:45:37,750
guy.

6004
02:45:37,750 --> 02:45:39,190
Exactly know what he's talking about.

6005
02:45:39,460 --> 02:45:40,210
That's impossible.

6006
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:41,380
That's entirely possible too.

6007
02:45:41,381 --> 02:45:42,280
You never in this one guy,

6008
02:45:42,281 --> 02:45:43,060
there's plenty of guys,

6009
02:45:43,060 --> 02:45:44,790
but you keep bringing up this one guy.

6010
02:45:45,710 --> 02:45:46,410
I'll go on,

6011
02:45:46,410 --> 02:45:46,930
hold on,

6012
02:45:46,930 --> 02:45:47,763
hold on,

6013
02:45:51,400 --> 02:45:51,821
hold on.

6014
02:45:51,821 --> 02:45:52,240
Hold on.

6015
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:53,050
Youtube.

6016
02:45:53,050 --> 02:45:54,730
The oil deception.

6017
02:45:54,910 --> 02:45:56,360
It's a five but let's hold off.

6018
02:45:58,010 --> 02:45:59,590
We go down to see,

6019
02:45:59,591 --> 02:46:03,400
just see if you find anything about his
credentials or that snips posted is 12

6020
02:46:03,401 --> 02:46:06,290
years old and it's just a message
board that you can't really count,

6021
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:07,840
so we'll just find something.

6022
02:46:07,841 --> 02:46:09,110
See if you could find something to him.

6023
02:46:09,111 --> 02:46:09,944
It's two minutes

6024
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:14,360
to just not be interested
in listening to this guy.

6025
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:15,140
I do,

6026
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:15,871
but not right now.

6027
02:46:15,871 --> 02:46:16,910
I'm good boy telling me.

6028
02:46:16,920 --> 02:46:17,753
No.

6029
02:46:18,560 --> 02:46:19,610
You're doubting is it.

6030
02:46:19,611 --> 02:46:19,971
Say No,

6031
02:46:19,971 --> 02:46:20,804
I'm not doubting you.

6032
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:25,840
I'm doubting the people that are telling
the truth or a bunch of tall tales do

6033
02:46:26,371 --> 02:46:30,560
it and you figure it out for the
Kennedy assassination expert said,

6034
02:46:30,760 --> 02:46:31,593
is this,

6035
02:46:33,170 --> 02:46:34,003
hold on,

6036
02:46:34,340 --> 02:46:35,840
Lee Harvey Oswald killed.

6037
02:46:35,870 --> 02:46:36,703
Jack can.

6038
02:46:37,940 --> 02:46:38,720
Hold on.

6039
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:39,650
He's fucking with you man.

6040
02:46:40,010 --> 02:46:41,480
How am I shocked of Jamie?

6041
02:46:41,481 --> 02:46:41,901
Jamie,

6042
02:46:41,901 --> 02:46:42,361
please.

6043
02:46:42,361 --> 02:46:43,520
That was the website.

6044
02:46:44,710 --> 02:46:46,040
A college website,

6045
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:47,960
trying to figure it out.

6046
02:46:48,020 --> 02:46:49,290
Dot Edu what is it?

6047
02:46:49,300 --> 02:46:50,133
I can't tell.

6048
02:46:50,230 --> 02:46:50,981
What do you mean you can't tell?

6049
02:46:50,981 --> 02:46:52,420
What is the URL?

6050
02:46:53,800 --> 02:46:54,870
Missouri University.

6051
02:46:54,940 --> 02:46:55,211
Oh,

6052
02:46:55,211 --> 02:46:56,044
okay.

6053
02:46:56,110 --> 02:46:56,560
Minnesota.

6054
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:57,393
On that Short,

6055
02:46:57,730 --> 02:47:00,190
so it could be a student created website.

6056
02:47:00,340 --> 02:47:01,173
Is that what you're saying?

6057
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:02,580
Entirely possible.

6058
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:03,930
This is the thing,

6059
02:47:03,931 --> 02:47:04,261
man.

6060
02:47:04,261 --> 02:47:04,560
Talk.

6061
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:05,341
Listen to him talk.

6062
02:47:05,341 --> 02:47:06,180
Don't read Shit.

6063
02:47:06,360 --> 02:47:07,193
Just listen to it.

6064
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:08,133
Just

6065
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:14,250
says he has one of the favorite people
of conspiracy oriented publications.

6066
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:17,743
Come on.

6067
02:47:17,780 --> 02:47:18,613
Come on.

6068
02:47:18,640 --> 02:47:19,980
Come on sites.

6069
02:47:20,050 --> 02:47:20,700
Do you book?

6070
02:47:20,700 --> 02:47:20,950
Are you,

6071
02:47:20,950 --> 02:47:22,170
what do you get your news from?

6072
02:47:22,200 --> 02:47:23,980
Camera one is this everything you hope.

6073
02:47:23,981 --> 02:47:24,814
Tell her this.

6074
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:25,870
Her name,

6075
02:47:25,910 --> 02:47:29,080
the station where you come up.

6076
02:47:30,390 --> 02:47:33,720
Oil Book is $2 where do you get your

6077
02:47:36,030 --> 02:47:36,870
New York Times?

6078
02:47:36,871 --> 02:47:37,591
CNN,

6079
02:47:37,591 --> 02:47:38,371
MSNBC.

6080
02:47:38,371 --> 02:47:39,001
Oh my God.

6081
02:47:39,001 --> 02:47:39,960
That's all the bullshit.

6082
02:47:47,190 --> 02:47:49,160
You get your invitation from you to

6083
02:47:50,830 --> 02:47:52,430
you get your news from CNN,

6084
02:47:52,920 --> 02:47:53,520
CNN,

6085
02:47:53,520 --> 02:47:56,400
I listed a bunch of channels
do cause you do what?

6086
02:47:59,830 --> 02:48:00,870
Do whatever you do.

6087
02:48:00,871 --> 02:48:03,170
Don't go to the news show for news.

6088
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:04,260
Where do you get your news?

6089
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:04,721
Where do you get,

6090
02:48:04,721 --> 02:48:05,554
you know,

6091
02:48:05,930 --> 02:48:06,870
never say CNN.

6092
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:08,400
I get my news.

6093
02:48:08,490 --> 02:48:09,910
This is what I tried to do.

6094
02:48:12,030 --> 02:48:13,310
It gets it from a name.

6095
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:14,413
God,

6096
02:48:14,430 --> 02:48:15,330
please relax.

6097
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:16,970
Please rely on to say,

6098
02:48:17,510 --> 02:48:17,770
hey,

6099
02:48:17,770 --> 02:48:18,311
please stop.

6100
02:48:18,311 --> 02:48:21,450
Does anybody drudge
report read it sometimes,

6101
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:22,470
but hey,

6102
02:48:22,470 --> 02:48:23,540
that's good news right there.

6103
02:48:24,320 --> 02:48:24,710
Good.

6104
02:48:24,710 --> 02:48:26,500
Sometimes here's the thing,

6105
02:48:27,150 --> 02:48:27,983
good.

6106
02:48:29,360 --> 02:48:31,580
This is what I like to
do when I go to the news.

6107
02:48:31,640 --> 02:48:32,380
I like to go,

6108
02:48:32,380 --> 02:48:33,710
I read some time ago,

6109
02:48:33,740 --> 02:48:34,573
Huh?

6110
02:48:34,580 --> 02:48:35,091
And then I go,

6111
02:48:35,091 --> 02:48:35,924
all right,

6112
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:36,980
who else has this?

6113
02:48:36,981 --> 02:48:38,060
And then I go online.

6114
02:48:38,090 --> 02:48:38,923
I Google it.

6115
02:48:38,970 --> 02:48:39,291
I go,

6116
02:48:39,291 --> 02:48:40,040
Huh?

6117
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:41,240
I read a bunch of different written,

6118
02:48:41,241 --> 02:48:42,830
this is all from being wrong.

6119
02:48:43,040 --> 02:48:46,490
This is all from getting committed to
an idea and then finding out it's not

6120
02:48:46,491 --> 02:48:46,910
true.

6121
02:48:46,910 --> 02:48:49,640
So then I go to a bunch of different
ones and then want to go to a bunch of

6122
02:48:49,641 --> 02:48:50,474
different ones.

6123
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:55,480
I tried to figure out what the fuck is
really going on outside where you look

6124
02:48:56,370 --> 02:48:56,930
and you go,

6125
02:48:56,930 --> 02:48:57,530
nope,

6126
02:48:57,530 --> 02:48:58,363
there's no credible,

6127
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,690
credible CNN both.

6128
02:49:00,770 --> 02:49:01,370
Hold on a second.

6129
02:49:01,370 --> 02:49:02,360
CNN has been wrong.

6130
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:03,920
They've been wrong about Bengazi.

6131
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:07,890
I'm not saying that they were wrong about
information that Hillary Clinton had

6132
02:49:07,891 --> 02:49:08,070
for

6133
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:10,110
sure they're wrong about
information the government had.

6134
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:14,100
They have a limited amount of access
to the actual facts of very complicated

6135
02:49:14,101 --> 02:49:16,290
issues like all journalists,

6136
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:19,920
all journalists dealing with top secret
issues have a limited amount of facts.

6137
02:49:20,190 --> 02:49:22,740
So you have to figure out who's biased.

6138
02:49:22,890 --> 02:49:24,780
Do you know Fox News is
biased towards the right?

6139
02:49:24,810 --> 02:49:25,890
Absolutely.

6140
02:49:25,891 --> 02:49:28,170
Is Msnbc bias towards the left?

6141
02:49:28,230 --> 02:49:29,370
Absolutely.

6142
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:31,920
Where's salon.com fit in far left?

6143
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:34,200
Where's drudge.com far right?

6144
02:49:34,290 --> 02:49:35,123
Who's right?

6145
02:49:35,130 --> 02:49:35,820
Who's right?

6146
02:49:35,820 --> 02:49:36,001
Well,

6147
02:49:36,001 --> 02:49:36,660
here's the thing.

6148
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:41,660
Don't fucking have an opinion until you
look at all of it because there's a lot

6149
02:49:42,391 --> 02:49:44,490
of bullshit and shenanigans going on,

6150
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:46,080
on both sides,

6151
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:50,490
and sometimes it takes a while to figure
out what the fuck is right and what's

6152
02:49:50,491 --> 02:49:51,060
wrong.

6153
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:53,580
The problem is confirmation
bias is a real thing.

6154
02:49:53,581 --> 02:49:54,301
I've had it.

6155
02:49:54,301 --> 02:49:54,991
You've had it.

6156
02:49:54,991 --> 02:49:55,824
We've all had it.

6157
02:49:55,890 --> 02:49:58,650
We've all wanted Dan Henderson to win.

6158
02:49:58,710 --> 02:49:59,543
We all,

6159
02:49:59,700 --> 02:50:00,170
you know,

6160
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:04,950
[inaudible] sometimes when
you see a fight like that,

6161
02:50:04,951 --> 02:50:06,600
and I've been guilty of
the same thing myself.

6162
02:50:06,601 --> 02:50:07,960
You see a fight like that and you say,

6163
02:50:07,961 --> 02:50:08,310
no,

6164
02:50:08,310 --> 02:50:09,143
you want bro.

6165
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:13,380
And then people get mad at me and
they'll say mean things to me on Twitter

6166
02:50:13,381 --> 02:50:15,870
because he threw a fucking pious bro.

6167
02:50:16,020 --> 02:50:16,831
Fuck a Dominick.

6168
02:50:16,831 --> 02:50:18,330
Cruz lost that fight bro.

6169
02:50:18,570 --> 02:50:19,110
You know,

6170
02:50:19,110 --> 02:50:21,810
fucking Conor McGregor was running bro.

6171
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,310
You know,

6172
02:50:22,310 --> 02:50:22,710
it's,

6173
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:23,610
it's going to happen.

6174
02:50:23,611 --> 02:50:24,444
It's inevitable.

6175
02:50:24,450 --> 02:50:25,290
But our boy Eddie,

6176
02:50:25,540 --> 02:50:25,960
hmm,

6177
02:50:25,960 --> 02:50:26,651
he loves him.

6178
02:50:26,651 --> 02:50:30,100
Something spiritually and I
pulled up is from John c Mcadams,

6179
02:50:30,101 --> 02:50:34,840
who also wrote a book on the JFK
assassination called JFK Sass and logic,

6180
02:50:34,841 --> 02:50:37,090
how to think about claims of conspiracy.

6181
02:50:37,360 --> 02:50:39,670
He described himself as a
debunker by temperament.

6182
02:50:39,671 --> 02:50:39,971
And then,

6183
02:50:39,971 --> 02:50:44,971
so I found the page where he breaks down
this Fletcher Guy and he's not talking

6184
02:50:45,401 --> 02:50:47,380
about the specific oil thing,

6185
02:50:47,381 --> 02:50:51,040
but he does take us a topic
or a version of a story.

6186
02:50:51,490 --> 02:50:52,323
Proudy has,

6187
02:50:52,520 --> 02:50:53,420
how'd he comes back in?

6188
02:50:53,421 --> 02:50:53,961
You'd say,

6189
02:50:53,961 --> 02:50:58,760
not a word of this cause I don't
want to get back fucked up Gremlin,

6190
02:50:59,750 --> 02:51:01,550
but they call him proudly isms.

6191
02:51:02,270 --> 02:51:03,410
I mean this is what he's known for,

6192
02:51:03,411 --> 02:51:04,550
the sweet he's made his career on.

6193
02:51:04,551 --> 02:51:06,890
It sounds like these conspiracy theories.

6194
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:07,850
I mean,

6195
02:51:07,850 --> 02:51:08,061
look,

6196
02:51:08,061 --> 02:51:11,330
he might be guy like Jim Marrs is
another book I gave to goodwill today.

6197
02:51:11,360 --> 02:51:16,040
Jim Morris had this alien agenda Book
and Jim Mars is also a guy who's a very

6198
02:51:16,041 --> 02:51:20,720
famous Kenneth Dat is an annoying
sound that you hear that shit.

6199
02:51:20,780 --> 02:51:23,120
Everybody who's touched that
America hears that shit.

6200
02:51:23,160 --> 02:51:23,993
America,

6201
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:26,210
Cameron Hanes because he runs,

6202
02:51:26,211 --> 02:51:27,380
he's fucking ultra marathons.

6203
02:51:27,381 --> 02:51:30,440
S E every 15 minutes I've
been following this guy.

6204
02:51:30,441 --> 02:51:32,450
We've been hanging out elk
hunting for the past week.

6205
02:51:32,451 --> 02:51:34,610
So I've been trying to
follow him up mountains.

6206
02:51:34,760 --> 02:51:35,630
This is what it's like.

6207
02:51:35,810 --> 02:51:37,460
It's like him running up the mountain,

6208
02:51:37,461 --> 02:51:40,190
me running 60% off the mountain and going,

6209
02:51:41,900 --> 02:51:42,930
I have to take a deep breath.

6210
02:51:42,931 --> 02:51:43,910
I take my hat off,

6211
02:51:43,911 --> 02:51:47,090
I have to fan myself enough to follow
him up the fucking mountain again.

6212
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:51,020
Can Get Eddie another corona so we
can go deep and black helicopter.

6213
02:51:51,410 --> 02:51:52,730
And I didn't mention this before,

6214
02:51:52,850 --> 02:51:54,230
but when you take your hat off,

6215
02:51:54,380 --> 02:51:54,661
yes,

6216
02:51:54,661 --> 02:51:56,180
that's like a shining thing.

6217
02:51:56,270 --> 02:51:56,751
I understood,

6218
02:51:56,751 --> 02:51:58,700
but I knew that they weren't
looking at me right then and there.

6219
02:51:58,910 --> 02:52:02,110
I had a fucking throw
some hair on my head,

6220
02:52:02,560 --> 02:52:03,190
dude.

6221
02:52:03,190 --> 02:52:03,710
Dude,

6222
02:52:03,710 --> 02:52:04,543
wear makeup.

6223
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:06,100
Like if you have a mirror

6224
02:52:06,540 --> 02:52:06,940
back,

6225
02:52:06,940 --> 02:52:07,511
you open it up.

6226
02:52:07,511 --> 02:52:09,700
You put a little makeup all
over your face and shit.

6227
02:52:09,701 --> 02:52:10,810
You were cammo everywhere.

6228
02:52:10,890 --> 02:52:11,050
Hey,

6229
02:52:11,050 --> 02:52:11,670
let me ask you this.

6230
02:52:11,670 --> 02:52:12,431
You do all this running.

6231
02:52:12,431 --> 02:52:13,480
What shoes do you do it in?

6232
02:52:13,840 --> 02:52:14,673
These right here.

6233
02:52:15,070 --> 02:52:16,350
I ran 200 miles in these shoes.

6234
02:52:16,360 --> 02:52:16,990
Under Armour's.

6235
02:52:16,990 --> 02:52:17,680
Yeah,

6236
02:52:17,680 --> 02:52:20,740
well I'm going to get me something
else and they say keep hammering.

6237
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:22,150
Matt's got his own shoes.

6238
02:52:22,540 --> 02:52:23,360
No shoes.

6239
02:52:23,360 --> 02:52:24,193
What?

6240
02:52:24,300 --> 02:52:24,491
Yeah,

6241
02:52:24,491 --> 02:52:25,120
he does.

6242
02:52:25,120 --> 02:52:26,010
I can get them online.

6243
02:52:26,050 --> 02:52:26,411
Yo Dude,

6244
02:52:26,411 --> 02:52:27,244
if you want,

6245
02:52:27,790 --> 02:52:30,290
if you want to run for
fucking three gases,

6246
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:31,700
do you want to run for three days?

6247
02:52:31,701 --> 02:52:32,670
She get your own shoes.

6248
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,140
He'd be good at sub only.

6249
02:52:35,141 --> 02:52:35,980
No time limit.

6250
02:52:36,490 --> 02:52:36,720
Dude,

6251
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:37,960
this motherfucker doesn't get tired.

6252
02:52:37,961 --> 02:52:38,794
I'm telling you,

6253
02:52:38,920 --> 02:52:39,970
I'm not in the best shape.

6254
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:40,301
I mean,

6255
02:52:40,301 --> 02:52:42,610
I'm not the most endurance oriented guy,

6256
02:52:42,611 --> 02:52:45,210
but I'm in pretty good shape
right now and I follow him up.

6257
02:52:45,230 --> 02:52:46,120
He's fucking mountains.

6258
02:52:46,121 --> 02:52:46,954
It's brutal.

6259
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:49,180
There's something about
like hiking up mountains.

6260
02:52:49,181 --> 02:52:49,420
You were,

6261
02:52:49,420 --> 02:52:50,710
we were talking about it before the show.

6262
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:54,010
It's fucking way harder to
do than you think it is.

6263
02:52:54,011 --> 02:52:58,300
Everybody thinks that manly shit is like
hitting tires with a sledge hammer or

6264
02:52:58,360 --> 02:53:02,560
fucking doing kettle bells and doing
fucking French presses like an animal,

6265
02:53:02,650 --> 02:53:02,950
bro.

6266
02:53:02,950 --> 02:53:07,750
Did 28 Chin ups fall this cock sucker
up a map and then you'd see as you're

6267
02:53:07,751 --> 02:53:08,680
going up the smell,

6268
02:53:09,110 --> 02:53:11,500
because like I talked
about another big bear.

6269
02:53:11,620 --> 02:53:12,550
We climbed up,

6270
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:16,240
barely meet and talk about it online
and you didn't know we was before the

6271
02:53:16,241 --> 02:53:16,491
shells.

6272
02:53:16,491 --> 02:53:17,640
I tell everybody because you're,

6273
02:53:17,641 --> 02:53:19,690
you're doing camp with Tony Ferguson.

6274
02:53:19,900 --> 02:53:21,940
Tony Ferguson's finding Rafael dos Anjos,

6275
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:23,860
New Mexico,

6276
02:53:24,470 --> 02:53:24,980
New Mexico,

6277
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:25,813
Mexico City.

6278
02:53:26,140 --> 02:53:27,460
November freight fight.

6279
02:53:27,690 --> 02:53:28,570
He's up in big bear.

6280
02:53:28,571 --> 02:53:29,261
He got a cabin.

6281
02:53:29,261 --> 02:53:30,760
He's fucking gangster.

6282
02:53:30,830 --> 02:53:32,350
When we talk about savage,

6283
02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:33,070
everyone says,

6284
02:53:33,070 --> 02:53:33,191
oh,

6285
02:53:33,191 --> 02:53:33,840
he's a savage.

6286
02:53:33,840 --> 02:53:34,480
He's a sabbath.

6287
02:53:34,480 --> 02:53:37,540
He told me Ferguson is a guy,

6288
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:38,830
damn savage,

6289
02:53:38,831 --> 02:53:40,390
tomorrow let's build you a house.

6290
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:41,920
He'll fucking hunt for you.

6291
02:53:42,130 --> 02:53:46,090
He's the way he's in the cage
is the way he is in his life.

6292
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:48,320
That guy is fear fucking lists.

6293
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:51,040
His worth ethic ethic is on.

6294
02:53:51,130 --> 02:53:51,371
Dude,

6295
02:53:51,371 --> 02:53:54,160
he's doing Jujitsu and striking
at four in the fucking morning.

6296
02:53:54,161 --> 02:53:54,994
Dude in big bear.

6297
02:53:55,150 --> 02:53:56,800
We're going fucking nuts up there.

6298
02:53:57,010 --> 02:53:58,090
So we cleaned him up,

6299
02:53:58,730 --> 02:53:59,563
bear mountain.

6300
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:01,050
We climb up bare fucking still,

6301
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:02,231
dude.

6302
02:54:02,231 --> 02:54:03,060
It was the highest.

6303
02:54:03,060 --> 02:54:04,930
That was our highest snowboarding point.

6304
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:08,560
And there's all these loose rocks and
you're thinking the whole time I told,

6305
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:09,400
I told him,

6306
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:10,000
I go,

6307
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,550
I'm here to teach you Jujitsu.

6308
02:54:11,830 --> 02:54:13,520
I'm not here to run a fucking marathon,

6309
02:54:13,540 --> 02:54:14,020
man.

6310
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:14,261
He goes,

6311
02:54:14,261 --> 02:54:15,094
come up to the match.

6312
02:54:15,460 --> 02:54:15,791
I go,

6313
02:54:15,791 --> 02:54:16,261
Nah,

6314
02:54:16,261 --> 02:54:18,250
I'm going to do some emails at the cabin.

6315
02:54:18,910 --> 02:54:21,130
We got a lot of hatchet man.

6316
02:54:21,130 --> 02:54:21,570
And I'm like,

6317
02:54:21,570 --> 02:54:22,570
I don't want to be a pussy.

6318
02:54:22,571 --> 02:54:23,650
I don't want him like I gotta.

6319
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:24,813
I gotta look like,

6320
02:54:24,880 --> 02:54:25,111
like,

6321
02:54:25,111 --> 02:54:25,600
uh,

6322
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:27,610
at least have a medium sized balls.

6323
02:54:27,611 --> 02:54:28,420
You know what I mean?

6324
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:28,841
So I'm like,

6325
02:54:28,841 --> 02:54:29,291
okay,

6326
02:54:29,291 --> 02:54:29,890
fuck it.

6327
02:54:29,890 --> 02:54:33,880
I'm had vans on I a vans on
and we climbed his fucking,

6328
02:54:33,910 --> 02:54:34,360
and it's,

6329
02:54:34,360 --> 02:54:35,230
we're not supposed to.

6330
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:36,970
I don't think we're supposed
to go to bear mountain.

6331
02:54:36,971 --> 02:54:39,220
We just parked and just
climbed up that motherfucker.

6332
02:54:40,570 --> 02:54:41,403
You supposed to,

6333
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:45,670
I don't know if people aren't allowed
to Kike as snowboarding resort,

6334
02:54:45,700 --> 02:54:46,181
you know what I mean?

6335
02:54:46,181 --> 02:54:48,190
I'm not sure is no snowboarding.

6336
02:54:48,220 --> 02:54:50,320
I think you'd probably get away with
it might be private land though.

6337
02:54:50,321 --> 02:54:50,501
Right?

6338
02:54:50,501 --> 02:54:54,310
So the biggest misconception for those
climbers is when you're climbing up and

6339
02:54:54,311 --> 02:54:54,700
you're like,

6340
02:54:54,700 --> 02:54:55,361
oh my God,

6341
02:54:55,361 --> 02:54:56,770
I don't know if I'm
going to make this shit.

6342
02:54:57,490 --> 02:54:59,170
These mounts are pussy
compared to your shit.

6343
02:54:59,170 --> 02:55:00,370
But for me as a civilian,

6344
02:55:00,460 --> 02:55:02,350
this was the fucking track man.

6345
02:55:02,351 --> 02:55:03,500
It was like eight of us.

6346
02:55:03,620 --> 02:55:04,430
How long did it take?

6347
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:05,900
It was like we're climbing Mount Everest.

6348
02:55:05,930 --> 02:55:07,210
It took us to,

6349
02:55:07,220 --> 02:55:07,450
uh,

6350
02:55:07,450 --> 02:55:09,320
to me it was Mount Everest and
I'm thinking the whole time,

6351
02:55:09,500 --> 02:55:11,450
at least when we get up going down,

6352
02:55:11,451 --> 02:55:12,320
it's going to be easy.

6353
02:55:12,410 --> 02:55:14,600
That's the biggest
misconception going down.

6354
02:55:14,630 --> 02:55:16,220
Works a whole different part of your legs.

6355
02:55:16,550 --> 02:55:18,050
Holy Shit.

6356
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:20,210
Going down is not easy.

6357
02:55:20,390 --> 02:55:20,850
It's,

6358
02:55:20,850 --> 02:55:23,000
it's just as hard in
a whole different way.

6359
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:24,020
How long did it take?

6360
02:55:24,890 --> 02:55:26,590
We all Goddamn day we were up there.

6361
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:29,290
That's a warm up and there.

6362
02:55:29,380 --> 02:55:30,410
There's bees everywhere.

6363
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:34,493
All God.

6364
02:55:35,700 --> 02:55:36,950
When the sun,

6365
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:37,740
when we,

6366
02:55:37,740 --> 02:55:41,930
we got to the bottom of the mountain
right when the sun went down and man,

6367
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:42,793
but just one day,

6368
02:55:43,040 --> 02:55:43,600
just,

6369
02:55:43,600 --> 02:55:44,600
you know what again,

6370
02:55:44,630 --> 02:55:45,290
to you,

6371
02:55:45,290 --> 02:55:45,950
that's some,

6372
02:55:45,950 --> 02:55:46,700
we did some,

6373
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:50,990
we did a white belt workshop
in Cancun and it was,

6374
02:55:50,991 --> 02:55:54,170
I know that slow and listen,

6375
02:55:54,171 --> 02:55:55,010
don't get me wrong,

6376
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:58,550
I was in the boy scouts for
two fucking years growing up.

6377
02:55:58,670 --> 02:56:00,140
So if it wasn't for that training,

6378
02:56:00,690 --> 02:56:01,523
there's

6379
02:56:02,440 --> 02:56:03,273
6,000

6380
02:56:05,240 --> 02:56:05,990
seriously,

6381
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:07,160
two years of boy scouts.

6382
02:56:07,250 --> 02:56:07,981
But the way I did,

6383
02:56:07,981 --> 02:56:08,791
I put a list out,

6384
02:56:08,791 --> 02:56:13,440
some bullshit boy scouts out
and goes to 60 hours a week.

6385
02:56:13,780 --> 02:56:14,613
You know what?

6386
02:56:15,410 --> 02:56:16,011
Hold on a second.

6387
02:56:16,011 --> 02:56:18,080
Hey is not a this big beer lake.

6388
02:56:18,530 --> 02:56:18,921
We want it.

6389
02:56:18,921 --> 02:56:20,270
That's a big bear lake.

6390
02:56:20,450 --> 02:56:21,590
Go there and top party.

6391
02:56:21,591 --> 02:56:23,540
You go to the top of big bear mountain.

6392
02:56:23,600 --> 02:56:23,761
Oh,

6393
02:56:23,761 --> 02:56:25,280
you know what have you say on Instagram?

6394
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:28,190
I did a minute video of
the whole for one minute.

6395
02:56:28,191 --> 02:56:31,450
There's all these scenes
of 8,000 right there.

6396
02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:32,690
8,008 oh five yeah,

6397
02:56:32,720 --> 02:56:34,130
that's down,

6398
02:56:34,460 --> 02:56:35,300
down all the way to the bottom.

6399
02:56:35,301 --> 02:56:36,134
Right there.

6400
02:56:36,190 --> 02:56:36,620
There we go.

6401
02:56:36,620 --> 02:56:39,370
Tony is a fucking savvy thousand
five that's a good time.

6402
02:56:40,440 --> 02:56:42,620
Don't live in that Tony.

6403
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:43,723
Tony is

6404
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:46,670
not a normal human being and dude,

6405
02:56:46,970 --> 02:56:50,690
that guy is a beast.

6406
02:56:50,960 --> 02:56:52,880
If he was up like an an Apache tribe,

6407
02:56:52,910 --> 02:56:56,660
he would be the leader of
the God damn tribe trusts me,

6408
02:56:57,020 --> 02:56:57,853
Tony.

6409
02:56:58,250 --> 02:56:58,671
Tony,

6410
02:56:58,671 --> 02:56:59,780
is this the fucking man?

6411
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,153
What do you way,

6412
02:57:02,010 --> 02:57:02,843
uh,

6413
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:04,760
when I did the race has one 65,

6414
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:05,660
what do you weigh now?

6415
02:57:06,470 --> 02:57:07,303
75.

6416
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:11,840
He was one and he did a hundred miles
and then he realized it was too much

6417
02:57:11,841 --> 02:57:12,410
weight.

6418
02:57:12,410 --> 02:57:14,980
So he starved as body and truck it down.

6419
02:57:18,730 --> 02:57:19,401
That's how I like,

6420
02:57:19,401 --> 02:57:23,390
you have to have ice shoes and a pick and
you have to follow a bunch of Sherpas.

6421
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:23,931
Yeah,

6422
02:57:23,931 --> 02:57:25,160
I had a different animal.

6423
02:57:26,180 --> 02:57:27,530
The rock gave him props.

6424
02:57:27,531 --> 02:57:28,070
The Rop.

6425
02:57:28,070 --> 02:57:32,180
Brock put up a post about him the other
day and we were out in hunting camp and

6426
02:57:32,181 --> 02:57:32,511
he's like,

6427
02:57:32,511 --> 02:57:33,321
Holy Shit,

6428
02:57:33,321 --> 02:57:35,300
the fucking rock posted something for me.

6429
02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:37,430
And yes,

6430
02:57:37,431 --> 02:57:38,264
because he wore,

6431
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:39,411
he wore blood,

6432
02:57:39,411 --> 02:57:39,711
sweat.

6433
02:57:39,711 --> 02:57:40,220
And respect.

6434
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:42,440
The Rock has something like fit,

6435
02:57:42,441 --> 02:57:42,771
what is it?

6436
02:57:42,771 --> 02:57:43,441
50 something.

6437
02:57:43,441 --> 02:57:46,310
60 60 million million to 8 million

6438
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:50,080
has more than Hickory.

6439
02:57:50,660 --> 02:57:51,493
Holy Shit.

6440
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:52,880
Go first one.

6441
02:57:52,940 --> 02:57:55,430
What is that guy's tee
shirt on the first one?

6442
02:57:55,580 --> 02:57:56,420
Spark race,

6443
02:57:57,020 --> 02:57:57,720
dude.

6444
02:57:57,720 --> 02:57:59,780
Th 2.8 million views.

6445
02:57:59,810 --> 02:58:01,890
Look at that 2.8 million.

6446
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:03,660
His fucking videos.

6447
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:08,640
So the Cameron Hanes one I think had
something like 300 how many thousand likes

6448
02:58:08,920 --> 02:58:11,730
for 420,000 likes.

6449
02:58:11,820 --> 02:58:12,001
Oh,

6450
02:58:12,001 --> 02:58:14,650
powerful for 24 minutes.

6451
02:58:16,440 --> 02:58:18,360
What if Instagram goes down like my space,

6452
02:58:19,230 --> 02:58:20,063
all those followers,

6453
02:58:20,080 --> 02:58:20,910
all that business.

6454
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:22,230
What happened could happen.

6455
02:58:22,650 --> 02:58:26,010
That's the same thing that people are
saying about Twitter is that Twitter is

6456
02:58:26,011 --> 02:58:27,030
starting to drop off.

6457
02:58:27,031 --> 02:58:28,410
But Instagram started to pick up

6458
02:58:30,320 --> 02:58:33,900
an apple thing because they can
cause they add to kind of chat.

6459
02:58:33,901 --> 02:58:35,340
Apparently haven't jumped on that.

6460
02:58:35,341 --> 02:58:39,390
Snapchat got off for like 16 benefit
of that over regular Instagram.

6461
02:58:39,391 --> 02:58:39,900
Explain it.

6462
02:58:39,900 --> 02:58:40,561
It's just a story.

6463
02:58:40,561 --> 02:58:42,330
So you can post this story.

6464
02:58:42,350 --> 02:58:42,600
Yeah.

6465
02:58:42,600 --> 02:58:42,870
It's like,

6466
02:58:42,870 --> 02:58:43,051
you know,

6467
02:58:43,051 --> 02:58:45,210
it's real quick so it
doesn't last forever.

6468
02:58:45,270 --> 02:58:48,390
So he could post 20 insta pictures.

6469
02:58:49,100 --> 02:58:53,790
I'm doing an Insta story
of you guys talking about
[inaudible] so it's just like

6470
02:58:53,791 --> 02:58:54,270
quick,

6471
02:58:54,270 --> 02:58:56,250
I haven't felt the need to
do that for some reason.

6472
02:58:56,251 --> 02:58:56,990
I don't know why.

6473
02:58:56,990 --> 02:58:58,560
Cause if you're gonna post
something like whatever,

6474
02:58:58,561 --> 02:59:01,470
something's kind of silly or
not that not a great picture,

6475
02:59:01,550 --> 02:59:02,470
which wasn't a story.

6476
02:59:02,660 --> 02:59:03,493
You

6477
02:59:06,250 --> 02:59:09,660
post pictures and I just put one up.

6478
02:59:09,980 --> 02:59:14,980
I just put a part of the inside story up
that like that couldn't be a video post

6479
02:59:16,010 --> 02:59:16,470
postop.

6480
02:59:16,470 --> 02:59:17,460
There needs to be an APP,

6481
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:18,680
a dick pic APP.

6482
02:59:18,681 --> 02:59:19,090
Hold on,

6483
02:59:19,090 --> 02:59:19,680
hold on.

6484
02:59:19,680 --> 02:59:20,513
Hold that thought.

6485
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:21,540
Hold that thought.

6486
02:59:21,540 --> 02:59:22,373
Hold that thought.

6487
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:23,700
What?

6488
02:59:23,700 --> 02:59:27,150
There needs to be someone that can do
some of you guys out in Silicon Valley,

6489
02:59:27,330 --> 02:59:29,070
make a dick pic APP.

6490
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:33,600
You could take a dick pic and then put
like something like make it make your

6491
02:59:33,601 --> 02:59:34,434
Dick look bigger.

6492
02:59:34,500 --> 02:59:35,333
Too verbose.

6493
02:59:35,400 --> 02:59:37,830
It's too embarrassing when it's small.

6494
02:59:37,860 --> 02:59:38,880
Too verbose.

6495
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:40,290
Is that what it said?

6496
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:43,250
Oh what is this?

6497
02:59:43,710 --> 02:59:44,041
Damn,

6498
02:59:44,041 --> 02:59:45,360
they got sunglasses now.

6499
02:59:45,361 --> 02:59:45,930
Holy.

6500
02:59:45,930 --> 02:59:48,730
And what's the benefit of smash and try
that again because for some reason it

6501
02:59:48,731 --> 02:59:49,564
just didn't work.

6502
02:59:50,380 --> 02:59:52,170
Something you Asian
guys out there and find.

6503
02:59:52,180 --> 02:59:52,651
Okay,

6504
02:59:52,651 --> 02:59:53,880
well that's racist.

6505
02:59:54,270 --> 02:59:56,430
You guys need to make a dick pic APP.

6506
02:59:56,520 --> 02:59:57,170
They can.

6507
02:59:57,170 --> 02:59:58,050
They're mainly white.

6508
03:00:01,340 --> 03:00:02,173
All

6509
03:00:03,520 --> 03:00:04,353
right.

6510
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:11,633
Hold that thought.

6511
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:12,473
What

6512
03:00:13,550 --> 03:00:14,070
it's saying,

6513
03:00:14,070 --> 03:00:14,903
Asian bad.

6514
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:15,660
No.

6515
03:00:15,660 --> 03:00:15,811
Well,

6516
03:00:15,811 --> 03:00:16,641
there's a lot of Asians.

6517
03:00:16,641 --> 03:00:18,420
Asians are the smartest
people in the world.

6518
03:00:18,421 --> 03:00:19,950
They're the ones programming everything.

6519
03:00:19,951 --> 03:00:22,500
That's why I say you agents
out there in San Jose.

6520
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:23,793
Okay.

6521
03:00:24,180 --> 03:00:25,013
You know what?

6522
03:00:25,050 --> 03:00:25,883
How was that?

6523
03:00:29,580 --> 03:00:31,050
Black guys have big dicks.

6524
03:00:31,080 --> 03:00:31,913
How was that?

6525
03:00:32,370 --> 03:00:33,300
I was Mexican.

6526
03:00:33,301 --> 03:00:35,220
I wish that was a Mexican stereotype that,

6527
03:00:35,360 --> 03:00:35,860
oh,

6528
03:00:35,860 --> 03:00:38,610
we've got me so happy.

6529
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:40,890
So explosive.

6530
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:42,090
Mexicans are fast.

6531
03:00:42,990 --> 03:00:44,070
I wish Mexicans,

6532
03:00:46,020 --> 03:00:50,340
if it was a Mexican third type
that we had gigantic Dick's dude,

6533
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:52,200
I would not be hating on that shit.

6534
03:00:53,550 --> 03:00:54,630
That's a good,

6535
03:00:55,120 --> 03:00:56,060
that's a good snack.

6536
03:00:56,100 --> 03:00:57,840
The rear fast and John.

6537
03:00:59,110 --> 03:00:59,381
No,

6538
03:00:59,381 --> 03:01:00,820
you can't say we have big dicks.

6539
03:01:00,821 --> 03:01:01,660
That's racist.

6540
03:01:02,050 --> 03:01:03,010
Why is this not working?

6541
03:01:03,040 --> 03:01:03,371
Come on,

6542
03:01:03,371 --> 03:01:04,204
man.

6543
03:01:05,130 --> 03:01:05,531
You can't.

6544
03:01:05,531 --> 03:01:06,910
You have a crazy strict diet.

6545
03:01:07,940 --> 03:01:08,520
Yeah.

6546
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:08,920
Yeah,

6547
03:01:08,920 --> 03:01:09,311
it did.

6548
03:01:09,311 --> 03:01:09,791
I just say,

6549
03:01:09,791 --> 03:01:10,820
wait it out.

6550
03:01:11,580 --> 03:01:12,051
You know what?

6551
03:01:12,051 --> 03:01:13,030
I'm trying to lose weight.

6552
03:01:13,150 --> 03:01:17,920
I'm trying to burn a thousand
calories less a day at the same time.

6553
03:01:18,030 --> 03:01:20,060
God dammit fucking hit me in the marathon.

6554
03:01:22,460 --> 03:01:25,000
God,

6555
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:29,210
you're replaying a snap
story for the fifth time

6556
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:35,230
because it's racist.

6557
03:01:35,540 --> 03:01:36,610
It's canceling itself.

6558
03:01:37,330 --> 03:01:37,661
I said,

6559
03:01:37,661 --> 03:01:38,170
hey,

6560
03:01:38,170 --> 03:01:38,640
hold on one,

6561
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:39,160
one second.

6562
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:40,810
Why can't a white guy come up with it?

6563
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:43,000
Like I can't put Facebook
and snapchat guys,

6564
03:01:43,001 --> 03:01:44,950
just executive produce shit.

6565
03:01:45,190 --> 03:01:46,030
Mark Zuckerberg,

6566
03:01:46,310 --> 03:01:47,050
man,

6567
03:01:47,050 --> 03:01:47,890
when I say Asia,

6568
03:01:47,891 --> 03:01:49,060
I had plenty of Asian

6569
03:01:50,890 --> 03:01:52,120
people thought I was Asian.

6570
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:54,490
People thought I was Filipino growing up.

6571
03:01:54,910 --> 03:01:55,870
When I say Asian,

6572
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:57,910
I'm saying that they're the
smartest motherfuckers out there.

6573
03:01:57,911 --> 03:01:58,750
You can't deny that,

6574
03:01:58,990 --> 03:02:00,460
but you're also saying something else.

6575
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:01,060
Think about it.

6576
03:02:01,060 --> 03:02:01,893
Samsung,

6577
03:02:04,270 --> 03:02:05,103
apple,

6578
03:02:05,180 --> 03:02:06,160
Steve Jobs

6579
03:02:08,270 --> 03:02:09,130
and Tim Cook,

6580
03:02:12,220 --> 03:02:14,310
Apple Gunner Jogger.

6581
03:02:14,340 --> 03:02:16,240
The Asians smarter than Asians.

6582
03:02:16,241 --> 03:02:17,074
Come on.

6583
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:20,400
Who's making this about new song?

6584
03:02:20,540 --> 03:02:25,540
You're talking about apple phones and
the fucking updates because it comes out

6585
03:02:25,871 --> 03:02:27,790
at fucking up left and right.

6586
03:02:27,930 --> 03:02:28,930
That's a new one.

6587
03:02:29,060 --> 03:02:30,670
Just that doesn't work.

6588
03:02:30,680 --> 03:02:31,513
Sometimes

6589
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:36,220
Asians are the smartest people
out there and you fucking know it.

6590
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:38,933
Wait a minute.

6591
03:02:38,950 --> 03:02:41,170
I don't know what I don't know.

6592
03:02:41,171 --> 03:02:42,590
Responding to shootings are this.

6593
03:02:42,700 --> 03:02:44,350
When I was growing up and what

6594
03:02:45,850 --> 03:02:48,640
a plus average in math and everything,

6595
03:02:49,090 --> 03:02:51,130
patients were always the
smartest in my community.

6596
03:02:51,131 --> 03:02:51,964
We didn't give a shit.

6597
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:52,451
We were like,

6598
03:02:52,451 --> 03:02:52,751
okay,

6599
03:02:52,751 --> 03:02:53,770
Asians are the smartest.

6600
03:02:54,010 --> 03:02:54,820
What's theirs?

6601
03:02:54,820 --> 03:02:55,930
Why is that bad?

6602
03:02:55,931 --> 03:02:57,250
How is that racist?

6603
03:02:58,170 --> 03:02:59,860
Wish they said that about Mexicans,

6604
03:02:59,861 --> 03:03:00,700
that we were the smartest.

6605
03:03:00,760 --> 03:03:01,593
I apologize.

6606
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:05,443
Some of them.

6607
03:03:05,650 --> 03:03:06,483
Ice Cube,

6608
03:03:07,470 --> 03:03:08,051
cube son.

6609
03:03:08,051 --> 03:03:09,250
Why did you send this to me?

6610
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,273
Oh,

6611
03:03:12,430 --> 03:03:13,211
you got this man.

6612
03:03:13,211 --> 03:03:14,250
She got it with your bare hands.

6613
03:03:14,570 --> 03:03:15,403
And

6614
03:03:18,220 --> 03:03:20,410
do you feel like in order to
cause real or is that bullshit?

6615
03:03:21,820 --> 03:03:23,040
What about polar bear?

6616
03:03:26,830 --> 03:03:27,940
You want to ask me a question?

6617
03:03:28,380 --> 03:03:28,900
Ask me.

6618
03:03:28,900 --> 03:03:29,733
Hold on.

6619
03:03:30,080 --> 03:03:30,913
Okay.

6620
03:03:31,130 --> 03:03:31,790
Oh,

6621
03:03:31,790 --> 03:03:32,650
global warming.

6622
03:03:33,580 --> 03:03:34,000
I think,

6623
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:35,140

6624
03:03:35,141 --> 03:03:35,540

6625
03:03:35,540 --> 03:03:36,700
here's what I would like you to do.

6626
03:03:36,760 --> 03:03:40,440
I'd like you to talk about things
with no emotion or theatrical trek.

6627
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:41,860
Mock things.

6628
03:03:42,070 --> 03:03:42,903
Don't go.

6629
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:44,433
Don't go crazy.

6630
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:45,671
I know I do.

6631
03:03:45,671 --> 03:03:46,300
I know I do.

6632
03:03:46,300 --> 03:03:48,340
I'm 100% Katen rip that off from you.

6633
03:03:48,341 --> 03:03:49,000
You're right.

6634
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:49,930
You're 100% right.

6635
03:03:50,020 --> 03:03:51,160
But what I would like you to do,

6636
03:03:51,190 --> 03:03:53,970
I would like you to attack
these things with just lodge

6637
03:03:55,540 --> 03:03:56,300
the third questions,

6638
03:03:56,300 --> 03:03:57,133
and we did.

6639
03:03:57,140 --> 03:03:58,100
You know we talk about some

6640
03:03:58,100 --> 03:04:00,770
shit that we don't talk
on their global warming.

6641
03:04:00,990 --> 03:04:01,820
I'm talking about,

6642
03:04:01,820 --> 03:04:05,150
it's the exact same shit with every genre,

6643
03:04:05,180 --> 03:04:05,901
with everything.

6644
03:04:05,901 --> 03:04:06,800
It's the same shit.

6645
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:11,660
It's the exact same thing in
every aspect of the elite.

6646
03:04:12,050 --> 03:04:12,980
Whoever's running shit,

6647
03:04:13,460 --> 03:04:16,570
that's just a little glimpse into
reality and we're not going to get into

6648
03:04:16,571 --> 03:04:17,000
glacier.

6649
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:17,990
That's the same shit.

6650
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:20,960
You don't want to be honey Dick,

6651
03:04:20,961 --> 03:04:21,620
Brenden.

6652
03:04:21,620 --> 03:04:22,460
Don't be.

6653
03:04:23,060 --> 03:04:23,893
That's,

6654
03:04:23,960 --> 03:04:25,520
that's a first honey date reference.

6655
03:04:25,790 --> 03:04:26,600
New t shirt.

6656
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:28,100
I don't know if you
haven't used in a while.

6657
03:04:28,101 --> 03:04:33,101
Tech is Eddie Bravo pointing at you go

6658
03:04:34,620 --> 03:04:35,453

6659
03:04:35,990 --> 03:04:38,990
What was the tissue you point and it says,

6660
03:04:38,991 --> 03:04:40,010

6661
03:04:40,190 --> 03:04:41,420

6662
03:04:43,310 --> 03:04:43,750

6663
03:04:43,750 --> 03:04:44,583

6664
03:04:46,580 --> 03:04:47,780
That's just Instagram.

6665
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:51,380
Instagram.

6666
03:04:51,381 --> 03:04:52,400

don't like that.

6671
03:04:57,620 --> 03:04:58,441
Look at the camera.

6672
03:04:58,441 --> 03:05:00,860
I already went through some deep shit.

6673
03:05:00,890 --> 03:05:02,600
How deep is the shit we went through?

6674
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:04,263

Everywhere you go.

6680
03:05:11,270 --> 03:05:14,480
It's the same people pointed
that everything though,

6681
03:05:14,481 --> 03:05:14,820

6686
03:05:21,261 --> 03:05:22,900

the second one.

6690
03:05:29,930 --> 03:05:31,220
Second one pointed that way.

6691
03:05:31,550 --> 03:05:32,383
There you go.

6692
03:05:32,800 --> 03:05:33,500

03:05:37,821 --> 03:05:38,720

6699
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:40,513
I don't remember.

6700
03:05:40,550 --> 03:05:41,383
We had a t shirt.

6701
03:05:41,420 --> 03:05:42,253

6702
03:05:42,290 --> 03:05:42,861

03:05:44,750 --> 03:05:47,120
Wait two and 10 Hillary Clinton.

6706
03:05:49,100 --> 03:05:54,100
I'll tell you exactly why because can put
up some post about a hunting posts and

6707
03:05:54,531 --> 03:05:55,280
some dude wrote,

6708
03:05:55,280 --> 03:05:55,820
idiot,

6709
03:05:55,820 --> 03:05:57,320
I hope you die soon.

6710
03:05:57,470 --> 03:05:59,000
Then we all have a party.

6711
03:05:59,001 --> 03:06:00,350
Fucking your dead body.

6712
03:06:03,280 --> 03:06:04,113
So,

6713
03:06:04,130 --> 03:06:04,581
oh yeah.

6714
03:06:04,581 --> 03:06:04,910
Yeah,

6715
03:06:04,910 --> 03:06:08,030
so I put that up online.

6716
03:06:08,060 --> 03:06:08,840
There it is.

6717
03:06:08,840 --> 03:06:12,200
So I put that up online and
I put Hashtag dead body,

6718
03:06:12,201 --> 03:06:13,034
fuck.

6719
03:06:13,310 --> 03:06:14,630
Here's what's crazy.

6720
03:06:14,750 --> 03:06:19,750
There was already two previous posts
with Hashtag dead body on Trump.

6721
03:06:20,600 --> 03:06:20,871
No,

6722
03:06:20,871 --> 03:06:23,900
just some dude in 2014
he was like in a band.

6723
03:06:24,880 --> 03:06:25,940
You know what the mafia,

6724
03:06:25,990 --> 03:06:27,560
the fanny pack mafia,

6725
03:06:27,561 --> 03:06:29,580
someone said that and I thought
that was a brilliant man,

6726
03:06:29,750 --> 03:06:30,780
but apparently that's huge.

6727
03:06:30,850 --> 03:06:31,880
And of pack Mafia.

6728
03:06:31,910 --> 03:06:35,090
You haven't heard that
fanny pack enthusiastic,

6729
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:36,890
obviously movement.

6730
03:06:37,090 --> 03:06:38,780
This recent one.

6731
03:06:38,781 --> 03:06:42,260
Someone recently put a dead but
Hashtag dead body fuck party.

6732
03:06:42,730 --> 03:06:43,940
He said just having fun.

6733
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:45,080
Macrophilia yeah,

6734
03:06:45,081 --> 03:06:49,220
I saw he saw your show a couple of
feet today and then he wrote compassion

6735
03:06:49,221 --> 03:06:50,250
Hashtag dead party.

6736
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:53,060
If someone fucking a dead body,

6737
03:06:53,650 --> 03:06:54,311
you would know that.

6738
03:06:54,311 --> 03:06:55,144
Oh God,

6739
03:06:57,300 --> 03:06:58,133

6740
03:07:02,040 --> 03:07:02,700
hands.

6741
03:07:02,700 --> 03:07:03,960
It's kind of a dead dude.

6742
03:07:03,970 --> 03:07:06,000
Get to watch anything crazy.

6743
03:07:06,001 --> 03:07:08,790
When you were in 1985
walking that this fucking,

6744
03:07:09,030 --> 03:07:10,560

through that curtain at the video store

6746
03:07:18,331 --> 03:07:19,164
to get it.

6747
03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:20,440
I mean,

6748
03:07:20,440 --> 03:07:20,770

6749
03:07:20,770 --> 03:07:22,620
Go to call Brandon.

6750
03:07:22,621 --> 03:07:23,380
Don't call him Brad.

6751
03:07:23,380 --> 03:07:24,570
You know what I call everybody?

6752
03:07:24,571 --> 03:07:25,290
That's Brendan.

6753
03:07:25,290 --> 03:07:26,123
I called Brian.

6754
03:07:26,160 --> 03:07:26,731
Everybody.

6755
03:07:26,731 --> 03:07:28,770
It's not just you because of Brandon Lee.

6756
03:07:28,940 --> 03:07:29,310

dragon's kid friendly and done shit in

referring to two words for you.

6761
03:07:40,231 --> 03:07:41,400

6766
03:07:52,890 --> 03:07:53,723
Listen to me.

6767
03:07:54,210 --> 03:07:58,380
When Bruce Lee left a tryin to
go and do the game of death,

6768
03:07:58,440 --> 03:08:00,050
they put the fucking fix it

6769
03:08:01,600 --> 03:08:02,280
talk.

6770
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:03,600
They fuck those Chinese,

6771
03:08:03,780 --> 03:08:06,300
they fall in that shit to the
end and he's have integrity.

6772
03:08:06,490 --> 03:08:07,470
How convincing me,

6773
03:08:07,620 --> 03:08:10,260
how are you not on that conspiracy
theory where Brandon Lee was?

6774
03:08:10,380 --> 03:08:11,850
Cause they shut it was onset.

6775
03:08:12,210 --> 03:08:13,043
No I'm not.

6776
03:08:13,150 --> 03:08:13,590
He is.

6777
03:08:13,590 --> 03:08:14,660
These are so good show.

6778
03:08:14,670 --> 03:08:15,540
You don't open a store.

6779
03:08:15,860 --> 03:08:16,470
How do you know?

6780
03:08:16,470 --> 03:08:17,790
Oh you believe that conspiracy theory?

6781
03:08:17,810 --> 03:08:18,720
I sure as fuck.

6782
03:08:18,900 --> 03:08:19,171
Oh No,

6783
03:08:19,171 --> 03:08:20,970
I'm saying I don't think he died on,

6784
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:21,750
I don't think,

6785
03:08:21,750 --> 03:08:22,830
I think it was an accident.

6786
03:08:22,980 --> 03:08:26,550
Oh you think it was an accident
and you think you know what?

6787
03:08:27,210 --> 03:08:27,900
Uh,

6788
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:30,480
I haven't tower seven.

6789
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:31,673
What are you doing?

6790
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:36,090
I'm sure Brandon Lee was
just like tower seven.

6791
03:08:36,210 --> 03:08:37,980
He was the Chinese half Chinese tower.

6792
03:08:37,981 --> 03:08:41,220
Seven week frame it as what you're saying,

6793
03:08:41,430 --> 03:08:42,240
what he's saying.

6794
03:08:42,240 --> 03:08:43,073
Weak frame.

6795
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,580
Do you know the one thing,

6796
03:08:44,640 --> 03:08:48,890
the one thing that over the last year I
used to think that when people would say

6797
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:54,030
like seed links and videos and
stuff about celebrities being,

6798
03:08:54,090 --> 03:08:59,090
you get loose celebrities being
part of the establishment.

6799
03:08:59,880 --> 03:09:03,660
And the agenda 21 like celebrities,

6800
03:09:03,750 --> 03:09:03,931
you know,

6801
03:09:03,931 --> 03:09:04,764
part of it.

6802
03:09:04,860 --> 03:09:05,071
Uh,

6803
03:09:05,071 --> 03:09:06,180
but over the last year,

6804
03:09:06,181 --> 03:09:06,451
man,

6805
03:09:06,451 --> 03:09:07,284
shit,

6806
03:09:07,380 --> 03:09:08,031
it seems.

6807
03:09:08,031 --> 03:09:08,864
Um,

6808
03:09:08,970 --> 03:09:11,220
what do you think about Robert De
Niro making that video about Trump?

6809
03:09:11,560 --> 03:09:12,393
I don't give him,

6810
03:09:12,480 --> 03:09:14,970
I think he was irresponsible because it,

6811
03:09:14,971 --> 03:09:17,400
he should've said vote
for the Libertarian Guy.

6812
03:09:17,640 --> 03:09:19,410
And he was like trying to
sway people to Hillary.

6813
03:09:19,560 --> 03:09:23,310
I think Hillary's clear.

6814
03:09:23,400 --> 03:09:24,630
He should've made why?

6815
03:09:27,540 --> 03:09:29,370
He's talking shit on Trump.

6816
03:09:29,730 --> 03:09:31,920
Talk Shit on the Hillary
to the fuck you doing.

6817
03:09:32,010 --> 03:09:33,630
You're going to push everybody to Hillary.

6818
03:09:33,700 --> 03:09:34,533
That's,

6819
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:36,270
that's dangerous.

6820
03:09:38,190 --> 03:09:39,300
I'm talking about Robert De Niro.

6821
03:09:39,390 --> 03:09:40,710
He's talking mad shit.

6822
03:09:40,770 --> 03:09:42,360
No one's ever fucking done that before.

6823
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:43,290
Get all right.

6824
03:09:43,290 --> 03:09:44,480
He thinks he's a bad motherfucker.

6825
03:09:44,490 --> 03:09:46,170
He thinks he's the dude from raging bull.

6826
03:09:46,510 --> 03:09:47,490
Put you in the face.

6827
03:09:47,610 --> 03:09:52,140
How do you know Donald Trump is
taking privates with John Danaher?

6828
03:09:52,230 --> 03:09:53,063
How do you know?

6829
03:09:56,150 --> 03:09:56,470
Oh,

6830
03:09:56,470 --> 03:09:57,580
I'm going to put you in the face.

6831
03:09:57,630 --> 03:09:59,440
The guy's 89 years old.

6832
03:09:59,530 --> 03:10:01,050
You should make it clear.

6833
03:10:01,090 --> 03:10:02,590
Make it clear ourselves.

6834
03:10:02,591 --> 03:10:03,424
A cock fight.

6835
03:10:04,030 --> 03:10:06,520
Jon Voight and Robert
Deniro going at each other.

6836
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:07,410
Fuck Yam.

6837
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:08,750
So Shane Cleo,

6838
03:10:08,800 --> 03:10:09,251
actor,

6839
03:10:09,251 --> 03:10:11,830
Bobby Deniros rant against Donald Trump.

6840
03:10:12,160 --> 03:10:16,150
What foul words he used
against a presidential nominee.

6841
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:19,000
Of course he says Trump's
words to not hurt anyone.

6842
03:10:19,030 --> 03:10:20,230
I disagree.

6843
03:10:20,290 --> 03:10:21,610
I don't think up to nails hurt.

6844
03:10:21,611 --> 03:10:22,444
Anyway.

6845
03:10:22,540 --> 03:10:25,570
Donald Trump is a con
artist and all that Shit,

6846
03:10:25,750 --> 03:10:27,760
but Hillary is a proven criminal,

6847
03:10:27,960 --> 03:10:30,220
so don't you make it clear?

6848
03:10:30,250 --> 03:10:31,210
You make it clear like,

6849
03:10:31,270 --> 03:10:31,481
yeah,

6850
03:10:31,481 --> 03:10:32,440
Fuck Donald Trump.

6851
03:10:32,470 --> 03:10:33,400
I'm all good with that.

6852
03:10:33,470 --> 03:10:34,220
I understand that.

6853
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:35,760
Fuck yeah,

6854
03:10:35,770 --> 03:10:37,450
make sure you say fuck Hillary too.

6855
03:10:37,510 --> 03:10:38,440
Here's my question.

6856
03:10:38,470 --> 03:10:39,101
Here's my question.

6857
03:10:39,101 --> 03:10:40,240
This is a legitimate question.

6858
03:10:40,780 --> 03:10:45,780
Is it possible that until the internet
came around and we were able to see like

6859
03:10:46,361 --> 03:10:49,000
all the different influences
on political processes,

6860
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:50,230
special interest groups,

6861
03:10:50,231 --> 03:10:50,840
lobbyists,

6862
03:10:50,840 --> 03:10:51,673
all that kind of stuff,

6863
03:10:51,850 --> 03:10:54,640
all these different things that we
didn't know whether or not we're real,

6864
03:10:54,641 --> 03:10:56,260
we all get to see it sort of consolidated.

6865
03:10:56,260 --> 03:10:56,980
Right?

6866
03:10:56,980 --> 03:11:00,370
Is it possible that these
people that are here,

6867
03:11:00,520 --> 03:11:01,750
these longterm people,

6868
03:11:01,751 --> 03:11:04,450
you don't have to name them because
anybody that's deeply entrenched in the

6869
03:11:04,451 --> 03:11:06,010
system for 2030 years,

6870
03:11:06,310 --> 03:11:11,310
they were used to operating back
in like the fucking Reagan days,

6871
03:11:11,531 --> 03:11:12,100
man.

6872
03:11:12,100 --> 03:11:12,521
I mean,

6873
03:11:12,521 --> 03:11:13,450
they were around.

6874
03:11:13,451 --> 03:11:13,811
They were,

6875
03:11:13,811 --> 03:11:17,680
they were getting into the
mix back when they were kids.

6876
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:19,360
Jimmy Carter was president.

6877
03:11:19,361 --> 03:11:20,560
Ford was president.

6878
03:11:20,561 --> 03:11:20,771
You know,

6879
03:11:20,771 --> 03:11:21,850
when they were in college,

6880
03:11:21,970 --> 03:11:23,140
they went to the Vietnam War.

6881
03:11:23,460 --> 03:11:23,920
Like,

6882
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:24,431
here's that.

6883
03:11:24,431 --> 03:11:26,020
You're dealing with all of them.

6884
03:11:26,190 --> 03:11:27,540
So when she went from Donald,

6885
03:11:27,730 --> 03:11:27,941
look,

6886
03:11:27,941 --> 03:11:31,420
you could look all down the list of
all the different people that have been

6887
03:11:31,421 --> 03:11:34,840
involved in American politics
over the last few years.

6888
03:11:35,110 --> 03:11:38,050
And most of them got their
start a long time ago.

6889
03:11:38,051 --> 03:11:40,240
They get deeply entrenched in the system,

6890
03:11:40,690 --> 03:11:40,991
and it's,

6891
03:11:40,991 --> 03:11:45,670
it's entirely possible that
this system is so fucking weird.

6892
03:11:45,730 --> 03:11:49,360
And there's so many loopholes as to
what's legal and what's not legal.

6893
03:11:49,990 --> 03:11:53,680
It's not about doing what's right or
doing what's good for the American people

6894
03:11:53,700 --> 03:11:54,560
is amount is,

6895
03:11:54,930 --> 03:11:55,240
it's,

6896
03:11:55,240 --> 03:11:57,910
you're competing with all these other
people that are doing the same thing.

6897
03:11:58,730 --> 03:12:01,090
Probably the biggest problem going on,

6898
03:12:01,210 --> 03:12:02,200
in my opinion.

6899
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:03,730
And I'm a fucking idiot.

6900
03:12:04,090 --> 03:12:04,361
All right,

6901
03:12:04,361 --> 03:12:05,194
how many idiot?

6902
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:08,080
But the biggest problem
in my fucking opinion,

6903
03:12:08,580 --> 03:12:11,320
show easily to honey Dick,

6904
03:12:11,470 --> 03:12:12,340
the masses,

6905
03:12:12,460 --> 03:12:13,960
the masses have all the power.

6906
03:12:14,020 --> 03:12:15,580
We see it in the weed movement.

6907
03:12:15,670 --> 03:12:18,100
Weed's being legalized in the
feds don't want that shit,

6908
03:12:18,250 --> 03:12:20,800
but the people are waking
up to at least weed,

6909
03:12:20,980 --> 03:12:23,200
but they won't wake up to
all the rest of the shit.

6910
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:24,580
That's the fucking problem.

6911
03:12:24,730 --> 03:12:28,450
The people that are gullible
and they just buy all this shit.

6912
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:29,830
That's the problem.

6913
03:12:30,070 --> 03:12:30,970
That's the problem.

6914
03:12:30,971 --> 03:12:31,181
Right?

6915
03:12:31,181 --> 03:12:33,400
Then wake the fuck up.

6916
03:12:33,820 --> 03:12:34,451
Jesus.

6917
03:12:34,451 --> 03:12:36,000
God Damn problem over president.

6918
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:37,330
That's the fucking problem.

6919
03:12:37,390 --> 03:12:38,223
Hey,

6920
03:12:38,320 --> 03:12:39,400
my question is,

6921
03:12:39,401 --> 03:12:40,300
you started that off with,

6922
03:12:40,301 --> 03:12:41,140
you had a question.

6923
03:12:41,860 --> 03:12:42,700
What was the question?

6924
03:12:44,020 --> 03:12:44,290
Hey.

6925
03:12:44,290 --> 03:12:46,690
Oh my question Jamie Brown.

6926
03:12:46,810 --> 03:12:49,330
Everybody's talking about the
reason why we have Donald Trump,

6927
03:12:49,360 --> 03:12:52,160
can we assume that
video is done is because

6928
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:55,550
everyone believes all
the shit they see on TV.

6929
03:12:56,270 --> 03:12:59,150
This is a result of all the skeptic score.

6930
03:12:59,390 --> 03:13:01,880
There's no fucking proof
that they're corrupt.

6931
03:13:01,970 --> 03:13:03,170
There's no fucking proof.

6932
03:13:07,270 --> 03:13:07,960
You know what I mean?

6933
03:13:07,960 --> 03:13:12,960
It's those mother fuckers in a trance
paid or in a trance or Zappos mother

6934
03:13:16,561 --> 03:13:17,394
fuckers.

6935
03:13:17,630 --> 03:13:19,820
That's why were we got Hillary and Trump.

6936
03:13:20,150 --> 03:13:22,760
That's why you mother
fuckers cause the you.

6937
03:13:23,780 --> 03:13:24,320
That's it.

6938
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:25,153
I'm done.

6939
03:13:28,020 --> 03:13:29,480
So I'll take a breath.

6940
03:13:30,050 --> 03:13:30,980
Think about what just happened.

6941
03:13:36,680 --> 03:13:37,513
We never saw the,

6942
03:13:38,040 --> 03:13:39,530
you guys haven't seen it.

6943
03:13:39,560 --> 03:13:40,393
I don't even want

6944
03:13:46,520 --> 03:13:47,270
to fuck up.

6945
03:13:47,270 --> 03:13:49,550
Whoever owns it for sure
will get pulled off.

6946
03:13:53,870 --> 03:13:55,750
Can we talk about gangs?

6947
03:13:55,760 --> 03:13:56,750
Will Watch it off the air,

6948
03:13:56,751 --> 03:13:58,730
but whenever anything happens,

6949
03:13:58,731 --> 03:13:59,870
it's like a news story.

6950
03:13:59,871 --> 03:14:02,720
It's like one of the ways that
video's getting pulled off of things.

6951
03:14:02,721 --> 03:14:02,910
Hey,

6952
03:14:02,910 --> 03:14:03,560
all your,

6953
03:14:03,560 --> 03:14:07,720
all your instastories are
up powerful damn door.

6954
03:14:07,880 --> 03:14:08,450
Instantly.

6955
03:14:08,450 --> 03:14:10,800
The five or six when you were
saying you had a problem there,

6956
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:11,390
they weren't,

6957
03:14:11,390 --> 03:14:12,890
they weren't posting for some reason.

6958
03:14:12,891 --> 03:14:13,724
Some of them weren't.

6959
03:14:14,600 --> 03:14:15,750
Sounds like they all got posted.

6960
03:14:15,890 --> 03:14:16,200
All of them.

6961
03:14:16,200 --> 03:14:17,630
Even with complaining about their,

6962
03:14:17,631 --> 03:14:19,570
I'll call them up.

6963
03:14:19,770 --> 03:14:19,940
Oh,

6964
03:14:19,940 --> 03:14:20,541
I definitely do.

6965
03:14:20,541 --> 03:14:21,160
At least 10.

6966
03:14:21,160 --> 03:14:21,281
Oh,

6967
03:14:21,281 --> 03:14:22,114
okay.

6968
03:14:22,400 --> 03:14:22,791
I was like,

6969
03:14:22,791 --> 03:14:23,660
conspiracy.

6970
03:14:23,810 --> 03:14:25,070
My phone's not working as good.

6971
03:14:25,071 --> 03:14:26,210
The fucking new phones out.

6972
03:14:26,330 --> 03:14:26,960
Okay.

6973
03:14:26,960 --> 03:14:27,441
Did you,

6974
03:14:27,441 --> 03:14:27,950
uh,

6975
03:14:27,950 --> 03:14:28,940
it's all but see,

6976
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:30,250
even though it's like insta stories,

6977
03:14:30,260 --> 03:14:30,641
salt,

6978
03:14:30,641 --> 03:14:31,880
like we did it on the podcast.

6979
03:14:31,881 --> 03:14:33,020
How do we know that's not fake?

6980
03:14:33,230 --> 03:14:34,063
Um,

6981
03:14:35,640 --> 03:14:36,473
oh shit.

6982
03:14:37,390 --> 03:14:38,223
It's all thick.

6983
03:14:38,320 --> 03:14:40,310
This could have been fake.

6984
03:14:40,460 --> 03:14:43,030
You guys get a Photoshop
that out for all I know.

6985
03:14:43,220 --> 03:14:44,053
It's like wheat,

6986
03:14:44,570 --> 03:14:48,410
wheat as an example of the power
of the people and shows the UFC.

6987
03:14:48,530 --> 03:14:51,190
That was the power of the
motherfucking people underground,

6988
03:14:51,200 --> 03:14:52,850
keeping it alive on direct TV.

6989
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:53,600
All those guys.

6990
03:14:53,600 --> 03:14:54,180
That was the,

6991
03:14:54,180 --> 03:14:54,740
that was,

6992
03:14:54,740 --> 03:14:57,290
that's an example that we
do have the fucking power,

6993
03:14:57,410 --> 03:14:58,580
but we can't use it.

6994
03:14:58,610 --> 03:15:01,730
I'm going to tell you wake the
fuck up then we could use it.

6995
03:15:02,300 --> 03:15:04,250
We can't use it until you wake up.

6996
03:15:05,840 --> 03:15:09,500
We did it with the weed and we did
it with the UFC and then we got,

6997
03:15:09,560 --> 03:15:09,951
it's just,

6998
03:15:09,951 --> 03:15:11,720
I know you guys meet proof,

6999
03:15:11,750 --> 03:15:13,010
but it's the reality.

7000
03:15:13,130 --> 03:15:18,130
The Pentagon just got busted spending
half a billion dollars on fake Taliban al

7001
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:20,260
Qaeda videos.

7002
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:20,351
Oh,

7003
03:15:20,351 --> 03:15:21,950
what the fuck does that mean to you?

7004
03:15:22,040 --> 03:15:23,390
You're going to ignore that shit.

7005
03:15:23,600 --> 03:15:24,500
That means you can't,

7006
03:15:24,530 --> 03:15:25,190
you know,

7007
03:15:25,190 --> 03:15:25,580
it was,

7008
03:15:25,580 --> 03:15:29,750
it's all been a fucking reality
show and everything's cool.

7009
03:15:29,810 --> 03:15:31,640
Everyone's going to sit
there and everything.

7010
03:15:31,641 --> 03:15:32,630
Everybody's cool.

7011
03:15:32,770 --> 03:15:33,110
Oh,

7012
03:15:33,110 --> 03:15:33,561
whatever.

7013
03:15:33,561 --> 03:15:34,790
We're just going to keep going.

7014
03:15:35,090 --> 03:15:37,340
I don't think they're making fake videos.

7015
03:15:37,490 --> 03:15:42,370
$500 million sake videos
making like it's seed.

7016
03:15:42,380 --> 03:15:42,870
Make It.

7017
03:15:42,870 --> 03:15:43,380
They gotta.

7018
03:15:43,380 --> 03:15:47,360
They gotta have the Arabic writing
and make it look like Arabic,

7019
03:15:47,420 --> 03:15:48,920
Middle East CNN.

7020
03:15:49,380 --> 03:15:50,550
Oh Shit.

7021
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:52,530
And I know you guys don't you need to,

7022
03:15:52,860 --> 03:15:53,071
I,

7023
03:15:53,071 --> 03:15:56,300
it's so outrageous that I understand
that solar ray just said like,

7024
03:15:56,310 --> 03:15:59,340
you need absolute proof that
you saw it on Russia today.

7025
03:16:00,180 --> 03:16:01,013
Today.

7026
03:16:01,170 --> 03:16:01,980
It's real.

7027
03:16:01,980 --> 03:16:03,150
It's actually real.

7028
03:16:03,270 --> 03:16:04,370
But I know you guys need to put,

7029
03:16:04,380 --> 03:16:05,490
because it's so crazy.

7030
03:16:05,580 --> 03:16:06,480
It's so insane.

7031
03:16:06,481 --> 03:16:08,100
Of course it's so insane.

7032
03:16:08,370 --> 03:16:09,480
But what the fuck of it?

7033
03:16:09,890 --> 03:16:10,800
If it's real,

7034
03:16:12,060 --> 03:16:13,230
what the fuck does that mean?

7035
03:16:13,380 --> 03:16:16,410
It means everything we see
on TV is all programmed,

7036
03:16:16,770 --> 03:16:17,820
not like just some of it.

7037
03:16:17,880 --> 03:16:19,500
I trust them here and I trust them.

7038
03:16:19,740 --> 03:16:21,080
These are strains,

7039
03:16:21,640 --> 03:16:22,610
corruption,

7040
03:16:22,920 --> 03:16:25,320
straight brainwash,

7041
03:16:25,380 --> 03:16:26,400
mine control.

7042
03:16:26,430 --> 03:16:27,263
So don't tell him.

7043
03:16:27,270 --> 03:16:30,780
Tell me where you are getting your
news from before you start talking.

7044
03:16:30,970 --> 03:16:32,100
Are you saying what do you,

7045
03:16:32,101 --> 03:16:32,934
what are you getting your fund?

7046
03:16:33,090 --> 03:16:37,530
Isn't it possible that even the
news people are being deceived?

7047
03:16:38,180 --> 03:16:38,850
They're being,

7048
03:16:38,850 --> 03:16:40,920
they're being told what
to do and what to say.

7049
03:16:41,040 --> 03:16:41,851
They're not involved.

7050
03:16:41,851 --> 03:16:42,684
So who's

7051
03:16:44,010 --> 03:16:45,620
the guy you see talking nick?

7052
03:16:45,860 --> 03:16:47,370
I don't have enough power.

7053
03:16:48,230 --> 03:16:51,100
I was talking about them because
there's looking at the way it,

7054
03:16:51,370 --> 03:16:52,320
that's a good question.

7055
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:54,120
There's also getting
people behind the scene.

7056
03:16:54,121 --> 03:16:54,954
Great Court.

7057
03:16:56,430 --> 03:16:58,590
It's the same shit that
we've gone through already,

7058
03:16:58,890 --> 03:16:59,940
but everywhere else,

7059
03:17:00,270 --> 03:17:01,800
everywhere else is just as corrupt.

7060
03:17:02,520 --> 03:17:03,450
So listen,

7061
03:17:03,451 --> 03:17:05,850
everyone's just sitting around and hope
and everything's going to be fucking

7062
03:17:05,851 --> 03:17:06,121
fine.

7063
03:17:06,121 --> 03:17:06,900
But guess what?

7064
03:17:06,900 --> 03:17:10,110
We got Hillary and we've
got Trump as candidates.

7065
03:17:10,200 --> 03:17:12,660
It's because motherfuckers
just want to ignore it.

7066
03:17:12,900 --> 03:17:13,740
That's what it's about.

7067
03:17:14,130 --> 03:17:15,210
Fuckers night.

7068
03:17:15,510 --> 03:17:16,343
None of,

7069
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:17,340
I don't give a fuck.

7070
03:17:17,341 --> 03:17:18,990
And I'd rather have Trump than Hillary.

7071
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:20,310
I know Trump's full of shit.

7072
03:17:20,700 --> 03:17:21,900
If you vote right now,

7073
03:17:22,800 --> 03:17:24,180
you know what have I vote right now?

7074
03:17:24,390 --> 03:17:26,010
It would be a anybody,

7075
03:17:26,011 --> 03:17:26,641
but damn,

7076
03:17:26,641 --> 03:17:28,110
I would vote for that libertarian guy.

7077
03:17:28,111 --> 03:17:30,420
I don't know shit about
him because he's not on TV.

7078
03:17:30,630 --> 03:17:31,470
He's not on TV.

7079
03:17:31,471 --> 03:17:32,610
He gets no new ship.

7080
03:17:32,880 --> 03:17:35,760
He had a moment on TV both
for that motherfucker.

7081
03:17:35,940 --> 03:17:38,160
Goddamn of both for that dude.

7082
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:42,300
But that dude might be fucking pot
and sold that libertarian can move.

7083
03:17:42,301 --> 03:17:42,391
We,

7084
03:17:42,391 --> 03:17:44,550
it could just be controlled opposition.

7085
03:17:44,670 --> 03:17:46,200
That's just basic,

7086
03:17:46,380 --> 03:17:46,740
uh,

7087
03:17:46,740 --> 03:17:47,610
domination.

7088
03:17:47,611 --> 03:17:49,800
One-On-One control your opposition.

7089
03:17:49,890 --> 03:17:53,100
You don't think the people at the
top are doing that kind of control,

7090
03:17:53,101 --> 03:17:53,680
that position,

7091
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:54,720
the Independent.

7092
03:17:55,410 --> 03:17:56,550
This is another website.

7093
03:17:57,060 --> 03:17:57,893
Hey,

7094
03:17:57,940 --> 03:17:59,280
what does that mean?

7095
03:17:59,281 --> 03:17:59,970
If it's true,

7096
03:17:59,970 --> 03:18:00,960
if it is true,

7097
03:18:00,990 --> 03:18:02,340
what does that mean?

7098
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:06,900
All your skeptics independently.

7099
03:18:06,901 --> 03:18:07,710
Shit.

7100
03:18:07,710 --> 03:18:08,760
That's what that means.

7101
03:18:08,910 --> 03:18:09,743
Each shit.

7102
03:18:10,550 --> 03:18:11,383
Then

7103
03:18:12,240 --> 03:18:13,290
all the guys that,

7104
03:18:13,291 --> 03:18:14,124
oh no,

7105
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:17,970
we're in there because we're
trying to fucking create freedom.

7106
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:19,320
You motherfuckers.

7107
03:18:19,710 --> 03:18:20,610
That's why we're in there.

7108
03:18:20,640 --> 03:18:22,950
You're trying to create
freedom in the Middle East.

7109
03:18:23,160 --> 03:18:24,390
It's a fucking scam.

7110
03:18:24,420 --> 03:18:29,420
500 fucking million dollars
fake ass terrorist video.

7111
03:18:30,821 --> 03:18:31,110
Hey,

7112
03:18:31,110 --> 03:18:34,680
fake ass terrorist video out there.

7113
03:18:34,830 --> 03:18:36,150
What the fuck does that mean?

7114
03:18:36,390 --> 03:18:37,223
What does that mean?

7115
03:18:38,910 --> 03:18:40,560
It doesn't mean shit.

7116
03:18:40,970 --> 03:18:41,671
It doesn't mean shit.

7117
03:18:41,671 --> 03:18:43,920
We're going to just try and
going on how much we drank.

7118
03:18:44,470 --> 03:18:45,330
I want to sip.

7119
03:18:46,470 --> 03:18:47,290
It doesn't mean shit.

7120
03:18:47,290 --> 03:18:48,101
That doesn't mean shit.

7121
03:18:48,101 --> 03:18:50,020
They make you guys are one shit.

7122
03:18:50,050 --> 03:18:50,351
Listen,

7123
03:18:50,351 --> 03:18:52,020
if someone's spent that kind of money,

7124
03:18:53,530 --> 03:18:55,420
we could ban God.

7125
03:18:55,540 --> 03:18:55,871
Damn.

7126
03:18:55,871 --> 03:18:56,704
If there was a way,

7127
03:18:56,920 --> 03:18:57,880
I don't want to be part of it.

7128
03:18:57,910 --> 03:18:59,020
Do you think you want to die?

7129
03:18:59,380 --> 03:19:01,310
I don't want to be part of it
and I'm going to shut the focus.

7130
03:19:01,840 --> 03:19:02,673
I'm going to shut the door,

7131
03:19:04,030 --> 03:19:05,150
but God damn it,

7132
03:19:05,410 --> 03:19:07,060
I wasn't a part of the weed movement.

7133
03:19:07,061 --> 03:19:09,220
I was just kind of just like
off to the side talking shit.

7134
03:19:09,580 --> 03:19:13,300
But I don't want to be like the dude
like those dudes in the fucking,

7135
03:19:13,420 --> 03:19:13,990
uh,

7136
03:19:13,990 --> 03:19:18,530
a normal move man and the guys that got
all political within the actually win

7137
03:19:18,760 --> 03:19:21,040
and to these meetings
and just the last chain.

7138
03:19:21,190 --> 03:19:22,270
I ain't doing that.

7139
03:19:22,540 --> 03:19:25,750
I'm going to know you don't
care to Congress meeting.

7140
03:19:26,170 --> 03:19:27,100
I took all the shit.

7141
03:19:27,101 --> 03:19:28,270
But you don't want to do the work.

7142
03:19:28,330 --> 03:19:28,871
I don't,

7143
03:19:28,871 --> 03:19:31,270
I just want to have a way
to go but let them do it.

7144
03:19:31,630 --> 03:19:33,070
I'm too fucking scared.

7145
03:19:33,100 --> 03:19:33,933
I'm too lazy.

7146
03:19:34,090 --> 03:19:34,923
I don't want to do it.

7147
03:19:35,200 --> 03:19:36,070
I can't get away.

7148
03:19:36,071 --> 03:19:36,910
You're doing something.

7149
03:19:36,911 --> 03:19:37,121
No,

7150
03:19:37,121 --> 03:19:39,580
I think in a way anybody talks
about us doing something.

7151
03:19:39,810 --> 03:19:40,010
Yeah,

7152
03:19:40,010 --> 03:19:41,860
because it would change our man.

7153
03:19:41,860 --> 03:19:42,461
We could do this.

7154
03:19:42,461 --> 03:19:43,750
You just got to wake the fuck up.

7155
03:19:43,751 --> 03:19:45,910
People are changing public opinion,

7156
03:19:46,150 --> 03:19:50,800
which is what changes like public opinion
sort of changes first and then policy

7157
03:19:50,801 --> 03:19:51,634
changes.

7158
03:19:51,670 --> 03:19:53,200
It just depends on your platform,

7159
03:19:53,770 --> 03:19:55,630
but it's also just getting
the word out in the view.

7160
03:19:55,631 --> 03:19:57,490
Like look at Colin Kaepernick with his,

7161
03:19:57,610 --> 03:19:59,230
his Stan about it.

7162
03:19:59,440 --> 03:20:00,490
Whether you agree with it or not.

7163
03:20:00,491 --> 03:20:02,290
It's brought attention to the situation.

7164
03:20:02,291 --> 03:20:03,460
Like we all know it now.

7165
03:20:03,490 --> 03:20:04,210
Exactly.

7166
03:20:04,210 --> 03:20:05,043
Exactly.

7167
03:20:05,800 --> 03:20:08,230
All these little things in
a lot of ways they add up.

7168
03:20:08,560 --> 03:20:09,201
You know every,

7169
03:20:09,201 --> 03:20:10,660
every little thing that happens.

7170
03:20:10,661 --> 03:20:11,920
It makes people talk about it.

7171
03:20:11,921 --> 03:20:12,754
It adds up.

7172
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:14,260
We got a band together man.

7173
03:20:14,261 --> 03:20:15,310
Cause when you band together,

7174
03:20:15,430 --> 03:20:16,690
no one can be singled out.

7175
03:20:17,050 --> 03:20:18,190
We could take it all back.

7176
03:20:18,340 --> 03:20:20,110
We could do anything
we fucking want to do.

7177
03:20:20,111 --> 03:20:20,471
We made,

7178
03:20:20,471 --> 03:20:21,370
we'd legal,

7179
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:22,061
we made,

7180
03:20:22,061 --> 03:20:23,080
we'd legal.

7181
03:20:23,470 --> 03:20:24,520
That's fucking nuts.

7182
03:20:24,610 --> 03:20:25,091
And you know what?

7183
03:20:25,091 --> 03:20:27,550
The feds still scheduled one to know.

7184
03:20:27,760 --> 03:20:28,750
They fucking fine.

7185
03:20:28,810 --> 03:20:30,040
Still scheduled one.

7186
03:20:30,280 --> 03:20:34,570
But the people made that shit legal that
the people have the fucking power man.

7187
03:20:34,571 --> 03:20:35,404
They do.

7188
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:36,353
But they get,

7189
03:20:36,390 --> 03:20:38,530
that's the reason why they're
making these fake videos.

7190
03:20:38,650 --> 03:20:40,060
Why do you think they're
making these fake terrorist?

7191
03:20:40,090 --> 03:20:40,440
Because,

7192
03:20:40,440 --> 03:20:41,920
because they know what the bottom line,

7193
03:20:42,190 --> 03:20:42,701
bottom line,

7194
03:20:42,701 --> 03:20:43,780
the people have the power.

7195
03:20:43,870 --> 03:20:44,740
So we got to make them,

7196
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:47,620
we got to scare them
because they have to go cam,

7197
03:20:47,621 --> 03:20:48,401
just trying to run.

7198
03:20:48,401 --> 03:20:48,851
What is,

7199
03:20:48,851 --> 03:20:49,180
um,

7200
03:20:49,180 --> 03:20:50,550
what do you like,

7201
03:20:50,950 --> 03:20:53,830
what do you think their objective
is to get us more scared?

7202
03:20:53,831 --> 03:20:54,280
Money.

7203
03:20:54,280 --> 03:20:55,190
Is that the button about,

7204
03:20:57,470 --> 03:20:57,730
hey,

7205
03:20:57,730 --> 03:20:58,091
listen,

7206
03:20:58,091 --> 03:20:59,360
when you go into wardrobe,

7207
03:20:59,410 --> 03:21:00,243
you know what I do?

7208
03:21:01,060 --> 03:21:03,280
I listened to guys that
used to be in the CIA.

7209
03:21:03,370 --> 03:21:05,140
John Stockwell look him up.

7210
03:21:05,230 --> 03:21:06,190
You listen to what they say,

7211
03:21:06,191 --> 03:21:06,880
the whistle blows.

7212
03:21:06,880 --> 03:21:07,810
There's plenty of them.

7213
03:21:07,930 --> 03:21:09,760
The John Stockwell man,

7214
03:21:09,761 --> 03:21:13,980
he came out and he just told you exactly
the way a fucking was and you know

7215
03:21:13,990 --> 03:21:14,201
what?

7216
03:21:14,201 --> 03:21:15,280
People at the very top,

7217
03:21:15,970 --> 03:21:17,920
there's a lot of great CIA agents,

7218
03:21:17,921 --> 03:21:18,820
like all the guys coming up,

7219
03:21:18,821 --> 03:21:19,870
they want to stop communism.

7220
03:21:20,050 --> 03:21:24,220
It's just a few key guys are corrupt.

7221
03:21:24,250 --> 03:21:25,990
Just like in every organization.

7222
03:21:26,110 --> 03:21:27,490
Just like in every agency,

7223
03:21:27,580 --> 03:21:28,900
just like in every government,

7224
03:21:29,070 --> 03:21:30,220
just everywhere.

7225
03:21:30,221 --> 03:21:31,810
There's corruption and it isn't just here.

7226
03:21:32,200 --> 03:21:33,033
Every,

7227
03:21:33,070 --> 03:21:37,390
every goddamn government
is the goal to create fear.

7228
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:38,140
The,

7229
03:21:38,140 --> 03:21:39,190
that's part of it.

7230
03:21:39,490 --> 03:21:40,810
That's part of it of course,

7231
03:21:40,870 --> 03:21:42,160
because fears control.

7232
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:42,940
Yes.

7233
03:21:42,940 --> 03:21:43,840
That's part of control.

7234
03:21:43,841 --> 03:21:44,674
A lot of control.

7235
03:21:44,930 --> 03:21:46,040
Food Control,

7236
03:21:46,280 --> 03:21:47,570
energy control,

7237
03:21:47,900 --> 03:21:48,770
a lot of control,

7238
03:21:48,771 --> 03:21:49,760
water control,

7239
03:21:49,880 --> 03:21:50,351
control,

7240
03:21:50,351 --> 03:21:51,184
all that shit.

7241
03:21:51,320 --> 03:21:55,580
Agenda 21 look into agenda 21
it's that a conspiracy theory.

7242
03:21:56,540 --> 03:21:59,870
Agenda 21 is what we need
to do to take this world.

7243
03:22:00,170 --> 03:22:05,170
The world leaders got together
and this is like UN shit CFR shit.

7244
03:22:05,870 --> 03:22:06,890
They all got together.

7245
03:22:07,280 --> 03:22:08,870
Fuck countries and borders,

7246
03:22:09,140 --> 03:22:10,400
all the guys with all the money.

7247
03:22:10,640 --> 03:22:12,070
So what are we going to do it?

7248
03:22:12,080 --> 03:22:15,170
It'd be best if we just fucking control
the shit and make it a one world

7249
03:22:15,171 --> 03:22:16,670
government and we control everything.

7250
03:22:16,880 --> 03:22:18,320
That's what we're in the middle of.

7251
03:22:18,321 --> 03:22:22,670
It's increments and people like just
like they don't notice it's happening in

7252
03:22:22,671 --> 03:22:23,504
increments.

7253
03:22:24,140 --> 03:22:25,400
We can stop this shit.

7254
03:22:25,610 --> 03:22:27,050
We could stop this shit man.

7255
03:22:27,350 --> 03:22:28,850
We could turn this shit around.

7256
03:22:29,040 --> 03:22:30,080
We don't have to fucking just,

7257
03:22:30,710 --> 03:22:32,530
just sit there and
watch it fucking happen.

7258
03:22:32,960 --> 03:22:34,130
Talk to watch it happen.

7259
03:22:34,160 --> 03:22:34,993
We can stop it.

7260
03:22:35,030 --> 03:22:37,760
I think what we talked about earlier
that lard culture is kind of like a

7261
03:22:37,761 --> 03:22:41,100
battleship and a lot of
words and then it's hard or

7262
03:22:41,100 --> 03:22:43,100
to make these big giant turns.

7263
03:22:43,101 --> 03:22:43,551
It doesn't,

7264
03:22:43,551 --> 03:22:45,620
it doesn't turn like a,

7265
03:22:45,830 --> 03:22:48,500
like a car getting educated
and getting in line.

7266
03:22:48,860 --> 03:22:50,600
It takes a long time to like,

7267
03:22:50,601 --> 03:22:51,500
everybody has to realize,

7268
03:22:51,501 --> 03:22:51,801
oh yeah,

7269
03:22:51,801 --> 03:22:52,670
we got to move this way.

7270
03:22:52,690 --> 03:22:53,660
Oh this is ridiculous.

7271
03:22:54,080 --> 03:22:55,850
I think this is what we're
seeing in this election.

7272
03:22:55,851 --> 03:23:00,470
It's like one of the last one of these
elections where we really interest

7273
03:23:00,471 --> 03:23:02,090
completely in a two party system.

7274
03:23:02,390 --> 03:23:04,260
I think we're like
realizing it's ridiculous.

7275
03:23:04,270 --> 03:23:05,740
Especially when you watched the debates.

7276
03:23:06,320 --> 03:23:08,120
I've never been so into
a presidential race.

7277
03:23:08,121 --> 03:23:10,100
I'm in watching like how
ridiculous or these debate,

7278
03:23:10,130 --> 03:23:11,270
how stupid is that?

7279
03:23:11,480 --> 03:23:13,820
I used to shut the whole country

7280
03:23:16,850 --> 03:23:17,840
cliche,

7281
03:23:18,830 --> 03:23:19,700
cliche,

7282
03:23:19,970 --> 03:23:21,530
polit politicians like,

7283
03:23:21,590 --> 03:23:21,861
oh,

7284
03:23:21,861 --> 03:23:25,340
I'm going to bring back people cause I
care about you and we're going to get

7285
03:23:25,341 --> 03:23:29,210
jobs and we're going to have everybody
working and women are going to have

7286
03:23:29,211 --> 03:23:31,340
rights and we're going to
do this and look it up.

7287
03:23:31,341 --> 03:23:32,174
Bring it back.

7288
03:23:33,290 --> 03:23:34,123
Cheesy,

7289
03:23:34,340 --> 03:23:35,640
cheesy right there.

7290
03:23:37,670 --> 03:23:38,503
Fuck

7291
03:23:43,760 --> 03:23:45,440
you guys realize what's going on.

7292
03:23:45,530 --> 03:23:46,610
That's what's going on.

7293
03:23:46,970 --> 03:23:48,280
Either you're going to fuck.

7294
03:23:48,281 --> 03:23:48,890
Yeah.

7295
03:23:48,890 --> 03:23:49,011
Oh,

7296
03:23:49,011 --> 03:23:49,940
you're like this.

7297
03:23:50,210 --> 03:23:51,080
What the fuck?

7298
03:23:51,440 --> 03:23:52,670
This is some bull shit.

7299
03:23:53,100 --> 03:23:54,330
I do shit.

7300
03:23:55,070 --> 03:23:56,140
Jesus Christ.

7301
03:23:56,760 --> 03:23:58,850
And Trump with Hilary.

7302
03:23:58,940 --> 03:24:01,310
I wanted Trump to sound good.

7303
03:24:01,490 --> 03:24:01,960
Really?

7304
03:24:01,960 --> 03:24:02,530
I really,

7305
03:24:02,530 --> 03:24:03,380
me too badly.

7306
03:24:03,381 --> 03:24:04,220
100% good.

7307
03:24:04,221 --> 03:24:06,200
And I had ended up turning
the channel cause I'm like,

7308
03:24:06,230 --> 03:24:06,981
I was afraid of what?

7309
03:24:06,981 --> 03:24:07,814
He was angry.

7310
03:24:08,020 --> 03:24:08,480
You know what?

7311
03:24:08,480 --> 03:24:09,920
If it's between Trump and Trump,

7312
03:24:10,480 --> 03:24:12,520
Trump Trump's full of shit too,

7313
03:24:12,830 --> 03:24:13,311
but damn,

7314
03:24:13,311 --> 03:24:16,130
I know Hillary is just
in the fucking program.

7315
03:24:16,340 --> 03:24:18,170
They are the establishment.

7316
03:24:18,290 --> 03:24:21,260
Everybody wants Hillary because
they know Hillary's president.

7317
03:24:21,380 --> 03:24:21,621
Ooh.

7318
03:24:21,621 --> 03:24:26,621
Everything goes full sail and demand
and fucking business as mother fucking

7319
03:24:27,021 --> 03:24:29,420
usually if we get Hillary in there,

7320
03:24:29,660 --> 03:24:30,830
no kinks,

7321
03:24:30,950 --> 03:24:32,370
it's the same shit.

7322
03:24:32,390 --> 03:24:34,730
We been doing 35 gas,

7323
03:24:34,800 --> 03:24:35,360
I'm going to go.

7324
03:24:35,360 --> 03:24:36,290
But if you've got Trump,

7325
03:24:36,560 --> 03:24:40,580
it sounds like he's going to fuck shit
up and then he's a man who knows people

7326
03:24:40,581 --> 03:24:41,414
are sick of

7327
03:24:44,880 --> 03:24:45,090
that.

7328
03:24:45,090 --> 03:24:46,560
Could easily be a distraction,

7329
03:24:47,460 --> 03:24:48,660
might be in on it.

7330
03:24:50,480 --> 03:24:53,250
They're talking about on it.

7331
03:24:53,730 --> 03:24:54,420
Luck.

7332
03:24:54,420 --> 03:24:59,420
We're dealing with fucking like some
Gotham city corruption type mindset and

7333
03:25:00,151 --> 03:25:00,771
Trump's base,

7334
03:25:00,771 --> 03:25:01,604
he could easily,

7335
03:25:03,130 --> 03:25:04,770
he might be part of it.

7336
03:25:05,790 --> 03:25:06,750
We need someone.

7337
03:25:06,780 --> 03:25:08,640
We need someone that
everyone's going to hate.

7338
03:25:09,230 --> 03:25:09,530
You.

7339
03:25:09,530 --> 03:25:14,530
Just imagine what that imagine
and you're partying together,

7340
03:25:15,540 --> 03:25:16,373
hanging out.

7341
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:19,250
I don't fucking trust shit
cause of the plot of dark side.

7342
03:25:19,980 --> 03:25:20,870
That's pain.

7343
03:25:21,960 --> 03:25:22,260
Pain,

7344
03:25:22,260 --> 03:25:22,890
that movie.

7345
03:25:22,890 --> 03:25:23,820
Come on man.

7346
03:25:23,880 --> 03:25:24,240
It's good.

7347
03:25:24,240 --> 03:25:28,320
It's some fucked up shit because
people who want to be Batman and Robin,

7348
03:25:28,321 --> 03:25:28,950
you know why?

7349
03:25:28,950 --> 03:25:33,930
Because the people that are watching
tower seven collapse a free fall speed and

7350
03:25:33,931 --> 03:25:38,931
believe the corrupt desk
government government is the
one that told you this is

7351
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:41,610
fires brought it down.

7352
03:25:41,950 --> 03:25:46,410
The corrupt ask government
office fires brought it down.

7353
03:25:47,390 --> 03:25:48,223
Say

7354
03:25:50,270 --> 03:25:51,080
Hey Eddie.

7355
03:25:51,080 --> 03:25:52,490
Yeah,

7356
03:25:52,620 --> 03:25:52,891
Eddie.

7357
03:25:52,891 --> 03:25:53,670
I see a comment.

7358
03:25:53,670 --> 03:25:56,520
It says come on and waiting
for Eddie to explode.

7359
03:25:56,610 --> 03:25:57,443
Oh my God,

7360
03:25:57,720 --> 03:25:58,553
that

7361
03:26:01,080 --> 03:26:02,850
is causing that.

7362
03:26:03,000 --> 03:26:04,680
That is the problem.

7363
03:26:04,990 --> 03:26:06,450
Whatever is causing that.

7364
03:26:06,840 --> 03:26:07,380
What?

7365
03:26:07,380 --> 03:26:08,213
Whether it,

7366
03:26:08,330 --> 03:26:09,010
I don't know.

7367
03:26:09,010 --> 03:26:10,950
Whatever's causing a man,

7368
03:26:10,980 --> 03:26:15,980
a grown ass man to watch a skyscraper
collapse at free fall speed,

7369
03:26:16,530 --> 03:26:21,180
like the weight controlled demolitions
do and have the corrupt das government

7370
03:26:21,330 --> 03:26:23,730
tell you that it was office fires,

7371
03:26:23,731 --> 03:26:28,620
all his shit you see on on a pop popular
mechanics and the discovery channel,

7372
03:26:28,621 --> 03:26:29,370
how window.

7373
03:26:29,370 --> 03:26:31,490
That's all from the
government motherfucker.

7374
03:26:31,590 --> 03:26:32,940
Opiate Goddamn eyes.

7375
03:26:33,210 --> 03:26:33,630
Dude,

7376
03:26:33,630 --> 03:26:34,770
you're being honey dick.

7377
03:26:34,771 --> 03:26:35,604
Dude,

7378
03:26:38,190 --> 03:26:39,023
the guy's Dick,

7379
03:26:39,030 --> 03:26:44,030
believe Kim down normal office
fires when that's the problem.

7380
03:26:46,740 --> 03:26:47,730
That's the problem.

7381
03:26:48,440 --> 03:26:50,190
If there wasn't that problem,

7382
03:26:50,340 --> 03:26:51,240
if we can easily,

7383
03:26:51,300 --> 03:26:53,040
we have all the evidence
in the goddamn world.

7384
03:26:53,160 --> 03:26:57,600
Open your handles five
angles of a 47 storey,

7385
03:26:57,660 --> 03:27:00,930
skyscraper collapsing at free fall speed.

7386
03:27:01,090 --> 03:27:01,410
Okay?

7387
03:27:01,410 --> 03:27:03,510
Government didn't say
shit for eight years.

7388
03:27:03,510 --> 03:27:06,120
Now they didn't even put it in
the nine 11 commission report.

7389
03:27:06,270 --> 03:27:10,650
They didn't say shit from
finally from public pressure.

7390
03:27:10,651 --> 03:27:10,861
They go,

7391
03:27:10,861 --> 03:27:14,600
what the fuck happened at tower seven
that was the camp do you think happened at

7392
03:27:14,601 --> 03:27:14,821
tower?

7393
03:27:14,821 --> 03:27:15,511
So they said,

7394
03:27:15,511 --> 03:27:16,141
guess what?

7395
03:27:16,141 --> 03:27:17,910
10 years ago it got hot.

7396
03:27:18,120 --> 03:27:19,050
He doesn't even know.

7397
03:27:19,051 --> 03:27:19,590
He's says,

7398
03:27:19,590 --> 03:27:21,920
most people don't even
know I get a great job.

7399
03:27:22,060 --> 03:27:22,860
Make It.

7400
03:27:22,860 --> 03:27:25,830
If you don't put it on mainstream media,

7401
03:27:26,250 --> 03:27:27,660
some people are going to find out,

7402
03:27:27,810 --> 03:27:30,780
but they know not everyone's going
to find out and you know what?

7403
03:27:30,781 --> 03:27:32,100
All the people you take all of them,

7404
03:27:32,360 --> 03:27:33,500
they had a five day.

7405
03:27:33,770 --> 03:27:35,760
There's going to be more
people that don't fucking know.

7406
03:27:36,030 --> 03:27:36,390
You know?

7407
03:27:36,390 --> 03:27:38,340
Most people do not know.

7408
03:27:38,400 --> 03:27:41,980
Three towers collapse
talked about this too

7409
03:27:41,980 --> 03:27:42,311
much.

7410
03:27:42,311 --> 03:27:42,701
Man,

7411
03:27:42,701 --> 03:27:43,810
we talk about this too much.

7412
03:27:43,840 --> 03:27:43,961
Well,

7413
03:27:43,961 --> 03:27:45,120
he's trying to start a revolution.

7414
03:27:45,121 --> 03:27:47,400
When we talk about this
like so many times,

7415
03:27:47,430 --> 03:27:49,220
you don't know what's going on.

7416
03:27:49,320 --> 03:27:50,480
What happened here?

7417
03:27:50,530 --> 03:27:52,130
How was fun?

7418
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:57,880
We went downtown conspiracy alley and
it's just fucking crushed by our seven as

7419
03:27:58,340 --> 03:27:59,173
an expressway.

7420
03:27:59,820 --> 03:28:02,260
GNOSIS really fucked up my high bro.

7421
03:28:02,261 --> 03:28:03,280
Give me a bad spot.

7422
03:28:05,010 --> 03:28:05,531
Anxiety.

7423
03:28:05,531 --> 03:28:05,891
You know what?

7424
03:28:05,891 --> 03:28:07,420
We can go right back to a,

7425
03:28:07,570 --> 03:28:08,440
we can go back to,

7426
03:28:08,460 --> 03:28:09,150
um,

7427
03:28:09,150 --> 03:28:09,570
no man,

7428
03:28:09,570 --> 03:28:10,840
we're just talking dude.

7429
03:28:10,870 --> 03:28:11,141
I mean,

7430
03:28:11,141 --> 03:28:14,550
we're just having you
get goes super Pancrase.

7431
03:28:14,551 --> 03:28:15,990
He gets super passionate.

7432
03:28:16,090 --> 03:28:17,790
You might want to look up that pancreas.

7433
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:18,910
Alan goes,

7434
03:28:19,030 --> 03:28:20,080
frank shamrock.

7435
03:28:20,140 --> 03:28:21,730
Don't ever forget about that fight.

7436
03:28:21,820 --> 03:28:22,940
I'd rather look at Patricia,

7437
03:28:23,710 --> 03:28:24,401
grab a rope,

7438
03:28:24,401 --> 03:28:25,390
and they got to reset.

7439
03:28:25,570 --> 03:28:26,410
So Alan goes,

7440
03:28:26,411 --> 03:28:27,101
it was all over.

7441
03:28:27,101 --> 03:28:28,780
Frank shamrock had them all sorts of shit.

7442
03:28:28,900 --> 03:28:30,190
Frank shamrock grabbed the rope.

7443
03:28:30,340 --> 03:28:31,480
He kept separating them.

7444
03:28:32,170 --> 03:28:33,340
And then finally at the end,

7445
03:28:33,520 --> 03:28:37,180
frank shamrock grabbed a toehold on island
goals and fucking breaks his fucking

7446
03:28:37,181 --> 03:28:38,014
foot.

7447
03:28:38,070 --> 03:28:39,250
You got to watch that fight.

7448
03:28:39,340 --> 03:28:40,620
That's Kim.

7449
03:28:40,670 --> 03:28:41,503
I get question.

7450
03:28:41,590 --> 03:28:43,120
What's the most dangerous
thing you've hunted?

7451
03:28:43,490 --> 03:28:44,620
Because I don't know shit about hunting.

7452
03:28:44,770 --> 03:28:46,810
And I remember you telling
me about a guy who hunts,

7453
03:28:47,230 --> 03:28:47,561
I freak,

7454
03:28:47,561 --> 03:28:47,951
but he,

7455
03:28:47,951 --> 03:28:50,060
he'd like 100 buffalo
and he would shoot them.

7456
03:28:50,061 --> 03:28:50,231
Right.

7457
03:28:50,231 --> 03:28:50,951
And then forgot clothes.

7458
03:28:50,951 --> 03:28:51,191
He would,

7459
03:28:51,191 --> 03:28:52,810
he would have to shoot him
again cause they charge.

7460
03:28:53,050 --> 03:28:53,591
Oh yeah.

7461
03:28:53,591 --> 03:28:54,900
That was a show that I watched.

7462
03:28:54,920 --> 03:28:56,350
It was really kind of disturbing.

7463
03:28:57,070 --> 03:28:58,360
The guy shot an elephant.

7464
03:28:58,480 --> 03:28:59,060
That's right.

7465
03:28:59,060 --> 03:28:59,340
Yeah.

7466
03:28:59,340 --> 03:29:04,340
And the elephant started running at him
and then the guy with the a rifle shot

7467
03:29:04,361 --> 03:29:06,430
the elephant in the head and I was like,

7468
03:29:06,431 --> 03:29:07,840
what is going on here?

7469
03:29:07,841 --> 03:29:08,270
Like this?

7470
03:29:08,270 --> 03:29:09,560
It was gnarly on,

7471
03:29:09,640 --> 03:29:10,710
on some of those in,

7472
03:29:10,750 --> 03:29:11,290
in Africa.

7473
03:29:11,290 --> 03:29:13,350
And that dangerous game you don't want,

7474
03:29:13,450 --> 03:29:15,520
I mean you can't shoot when
they're way out there because your,

7475
03:29:15,550 --> 03:29:17,590
your aim isn't going to be that accurate.

7476
03:29:17,650 --> 03:29:20,440
So you have to wait actually till
they're right there til you know,

7477
03:29:20,610 --> 03:29:21,610
and we've got to get on.

7478
03:29:21,660 --> 03:29:22,630
They're kind of dangerous game.

7479
03:29:22,631 --> 03:29:24,580
We talked to their elephant,

7480
03:29:24,670 --> 03:29:26,410
a hippo.

7481
03:29:26,710 --> 03:29:26,970
Ooh.

7482
03:29:26,970 --> 03:29:28,210
Halos or buffalo.

7483
03:29:28,570 --> 03:29:31,540
That Cape Buffalo hunting is very crazy.

7484
03:29:32,410 --> 03:29:33,610
That's one of those things where you go,

7485
03:29:33,730 --> 03:29:38,510
we have these arbitrary rules as to what
you can kill and what you can't kill

7486
03:29:38,511 --> 03:29:38,631
him.

7487
03:29:38,631 --> 03:29:39,640
It's a very strange,

7488
03:29:39,730 --> 03:29:43,330
but we all agree to them like we all
agree it's okay to swat mosquitoes.

7489
03:29:43,630 --> 03:29:45,550
Nobody gets mad at you
when you swap a mosquito.

7490
03:29:45,580 --> 03:29:48,190
Nobody gets mad at you
when you swat a fly fly.

7491
03:29:48,520 --> 03:29:49,930
But he Kilifi nobody gives a shit.

7492
03:29:49,931 --> 03:29:50,650
You step on a roach.

7493
03:29:50,650 --> 03:29:52,540
Nobody gives a fuck about a roach.

7494
03:29:52,870 --> 03:29:53,830
But then you start moving up.

7495
03:29:53,850 --> 03:29:55,150
Just can you stop a mouse?

7496
03:29:55,210 --> 03:29:55,810
Definitely not.

7497
03:29:55,810 --> 03:29:56,501
Definitely not.

7498
03:29:56,501 --> 03:29:57,410
If you stomp them out,

7499
03:29:57,411 --> 03:29:58,300
so you're a piece of shit,

7500
03:29:58,480 --> 03:30:00,940
but if you put a mouse in a mouse trap,

7501
03:30:01,120 --> 03:30:01,661
hey,

7502
03:30:01,661 --> 03:30:02,890
you're not doing the dirty work.

7503
03:30:03,040 --> 03:30:06,670
You're farming it out to some
fucking mercenary spring set up.

7504
03:30:06,880 --> 03:30:07,240
Right.

7505
03:30:07,240 --> 03:30:07,421
Okay.

7506
03:30:07,421 --> 03:30:08,254
What about rats?

7507
03:30:08,640 --> 03:30:10,030
He can't stomp around either.

7508
03:30:10,060 --> 03:30:10,630
Okay.

7509
03:30:10,630 --> 03:30:11,010
Um,

7510
03:30:11,010 --> 03:30:11,350
physical.

7511
03:30:11,350 --> 03:30:12,220
What about a beaver?

7512
03:30:12,340 --> 03:30:12,521
No,

7513
03:30:12,521 --> 03:30:13,900
you can't kick a beaver to death.

7514
03:30:13,930 --> 03:30:14,763
Okay.

7515
03:30:15,430 --> 03:30:16,720
I can't kick a baby to death.

7516
03:30:16,750 --> 03:30:17,200
All right.

7517
03:30:17,200 --> 03:30:17,890
Okay.

7518
03:30:17,890 --> 03:30:18,261
Well what,

7519
03:30:18,261 --> 03:30:18,491
what,

7520
03:30:18,491 --> 03:30:18,731
what,

7521
03:30:18,731 --> 03:30:19,511
what level?

7522
03:30:19,511 --> 03:30:20,560
When do we decide this?

7523
03:30:20,561 --> 03:30:20,711
Like,

7524
03:30:20,711 --> 03:30:25,060
what weird distinction do we make
about what life we can consume?

7525
03:30:25,500 --> 03:30:26,260
Societies.

7526
03:30:26,260 --> 03:30:28,420
Society's you decided it strange,

7527
03:30:28,421 --> 03:30:28,750
right?

7528
03:30:28,750 --> 03:30:31,420
Cause it from movies cause
we make them so friendly.

7529
03:30:31,421 --> 03:30:31,931
You know what I'm saying?

7530
03:30:31,931 --> 03:30:32,451
Like a raft.

7531
03:30:32,451 --> 03:30:34,090
It tooi Bambi.

7532
03:30:34,091 --> 03:30:35,830
You have all these animals
for sure that I was,

7533
03:30:35,831 --> 03:30:37,630
bears are always friendly and movies.

7534
03:30:37,750 --> 03:30:38,583
Whole weeks,

7535
03:30:39,050 --> 03:30:39,590
cranes,

7536
03:30:39,590 --> 03:30:41,790
Jersey theory or my God,

7537
03:30:44,080 --> 03:30:44,450
Eddie.

7538
03:30:44,450 --> 03:30:45,050
Let's,

7539
03:30:45,050 --> 03:30:47,120
what if we were supposed to eat insects,

7540
03:30:47,150 --> 03:30:49,580
but we were brainwashed into
thinking they were gross.

7541
03:30:49,600 --> 03:30:49,720
Well,

7542
03:30:49,720 --> 03:30:50,360
people use it.

7543
03:30:50,360 --> 03:30:51,350
We ate insects.

7544
03:30:51,351 --> 03:30:53,090
We wouldn't be on the tit.

7545
03:30:53,240 --> 03:30:53,421
Well,

7546
03:30:53,421 --> 03:30:54,800
I don't think it's a conspiracy theory,

7547
03:30:54,801 --> 03:30:57,290
but it's definitely something
that people are realizing,

7548
03:30:57,291 --> 03:30:59,360
especially with crickets and grasshoppers.

7549
03:30:59,390 --> 03:31:02,490
And they'll approach
really healthy brought,

7550
03:31:02,520 --> 03:31:03,890
I'm scared to death of him.

7551
03:31:03,891 --> 03:31:05,600
I'm scared of that because of bugs.

7552
03:31:05,601 --> 03:31:05,901
You know,

7553
03:31:05,901 --> 03:31:06,160
like,

7554
03:31:06,160 --> 03:31:07,630
like what if we're supposed to be like,

7555
03:31:07,900 --> 03:31:09,200
I know I do too as Lyme disease.

7556
03:31:09,201 --> 03:31:10,034
I was talking to this dude,

7557
03:31:10,300 --> 03:31:11,750
that kid that we were hanging out with.

7558
03:31:11,780 --> 03:31:12,380
Yeah.

7559
03:31:12,380 --> 03:31:12,681
Yeah.

7560
03:31:12,681 --> 03:31:13,400
He was uh,

7561
03:31:13,400 --> 03:31:15,390
talking about Lyme disease and uh,

7562
03:31:15,500 --> 03:31:16,550
he was saying that,

7563
03:31:16,551 --> 03:31:16,671
uh,

7564
03:31:16,671 --> 03:31:18,980
he got bit by a tick and I know,

7565
03:31:19,160 --> 03:31:20,290
I know three,

7566
03:31:20,330 --> 03:31:24,830
four people that have gotten Lyme disease
from ticks and you get bit by these

7567
03:31:24,831 --> 03:31:26,960
fucking ticks and it fucks
with your immune system.

7568
03:31:27,140 --> 03:31:28,310
That's the only way to get it.

7569
03:31:28,440 --> 03:31:29,930
Or you're pretty sure that it is the only

7570
03:31:31,440 --> 03:31:35,690
tax because people are scared of the
Times because bugs transmit horrible

7571
03:31:35,691 --> 03:31:36,231
diseases.

7572
03:31:36,231 --> 03:31:37,130
It ruined your life.

7573
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:40,370
Like ticks in particular
transmit horrible diseases.

7574
03:31:40,371 --> 03:31:43,760
If you thought the black plague was
from rats wasn't really from rats,

7575
03:31:43,970 --> 03:31:45,920
it was from what the rats
were carrying them there,

7576
03:31:45,921 --> 03:31:49,370
they were carrying some sort
of Mites or bacteria or some,

7577
03:31:49,371 --> 03:31:50,630
some bugs or some shit.

7578
03:31:50,810 --> 03:31:53,000
Like what was the black
plague that it came,

7579
03:31:53,180 --> 03:31:54,410
I'm pretty sure this,

7580
03:31:54,530 --> 03:31:57,470
that it came off of things
that lived on the rats.

7581
03:31:57,500 --> 03:31:58,900
It wasn't necessarily the rats itself.

7582
03:31:58,950 --> 03:32:02,450
Also insects kill more humans than any
other animal in the world does he know

7583
03:32:02,451 --> 03:32:03,950
black widows are like Viagara.

7584
03:32:04,940 --> 03:32:05,773
Here it is.

7585
03:32:05,810 --> 03:32:10,130
The black plague barber
caused by bacterium.

7586
03:32:10,190 --> 03:32:10,940
Yeah,

7587
03:32:10,940 --> 03:32:11,631
pesticides.

7588
03:32:11,631 --> 03:32:14,000
This circulates amongst the wild rodents.

7589
03:32:14,090 --> 03:32:14,380
So,

7590
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:15,260
so that was a,

7591
03:32:15,530 --> 03:32:16,820
it was a bacteria.

7592
03:32:17,050 --> 03:32:20,690
It was some sort of a disease that
lived off the rodents as a bug.

7593
03:32:20,990 --> 03:32:21,950
It's a fucking bug.

7594
03:32:21,970 --> 03:32:22,970
Cause a million bugs.

7595
03:32:22,971 --> 03:32:24,920
They could just think about,

7596
03:32:24,921 --> 03:32:27,290
have you ever tried to
just grab a grasshopper?

7597
03:32:27,740 --> 03:32:28,730
It's weird.

7598
03:32:28,731 --> 03:32:29,564
It's weird.

7599
03:32:29,940 --> 03:32:30,840
Tries to jump in.

7600
03:32:30,841 --> 03:32:31,700
You want to let it go.

7601
03:32:31,701 --> 03:32:35,120
And it's like the guy's scary
at generation after generation.

7602
03:32:35,270 --> 03:32:37,600
What if we were like fucking
really good at insects?

7603
03:32:37,660 --> 03:32:38,500
What we used to be,

7604
03:32:38,501 --> 03:32:38,840
man,

7605
03:32:38,840 --> 03:32:39,051
this,

7606
03:32:39,051 --> 03:32:43,520
if you ever talked to anybody who is
like a bug catcher or a moth catcher or

7607
03:32:43,700 --> 03:32:45,110
somebody collects butterflies,

7608
03:32:45,530 --> 03:32:50,450
they say that there's a thrill that people
get when you catch up of rare bug and

7609
03:32:50,451 --> 03:32:51,500
you cash in your neck.

7610
03:32:51,650 --> 03:32:54,830
That goes DNA deep because
at one point in time,

7611
03:32:54,980 --> 03:32:55,721
humans are,

7612
03:32:55,721 --> 03:32:56,301
our answers.

7613
03:32:56,301 --> 03:32:57,770
Did you used to be insectivores.

7614
03:32:58,070 --> 03:32:58,560
So the,

7615
03:32:58,560 --> 03:33:00,200
the people that are like bug catchers,

7616
03:33:00,201 --> 03:33:04,960
they want us like them on boards and
Shit and study all these different them.

7617
03:33:05,170 --> 03:33:05,760
Yeah.

7618
03:33:05,760 --> 03:33:06,270
It's,

7619
03:33:06,270 --> 03:33:10,160
it's a life form that you're allowed to
capture because they only live like a

7620
03:33:10,161 --> 03:33:11,060
week anyway.

7621
03:33:11,510 --> 03:33:12,680
And so you're allowed to have these,

7622
03:33:12,681 --> 03:33:14,930
you're a trophy hunter for butterflies.

7623
03:33:15,230 --> 03:33:15,890
You're allowed to be,

7624
03:33:15,890 --> 03:33:16,670
but you're like,

7625
03:33:16,670 --> 03:33:17,760
you're a person who's an,

7626
03:33:17,910 --> 03:33:18,320
you know,

7627
03:33:18,320 --> 03:33:19,940
Urus you're studying,

7628
03:33:19,970 --> 03:33:20,930
you're studying these animals,

7629
03:33:21,410 --> 03:33:22,243
killing you.

7630
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:23,510
But the guy die anyway.

7631
03:33:23,511 --> 03:33:24,630
I mean some of them just died,

7632
03:33:24,900 --> 03:33:29,780
but the cavemen didn't have drawings on
the cave wall of spearing a grasshopper

7633
03:33:30,760 --> 03:33:31,030
will,

7634
03:33:31,030 --> 03:33:33,320
is this stuff good meeting point.

7635
03:33:33,390 --> 03:33:34,790
A line's right there.

7636
03:33:37,070 --> 03:33:38,160
You could start

7637
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:41,220
off a conversation with that shit
just cause I don't know anything about

7638
03:33:41,221 --> 03:33:41,431
hunting.

7639
03:33:41,431 --> 03:33:43,500
But when you go to Africa
to hunt that dangerous game,

7640
03:33:43,501 --> 03:33:44,220
what's the point?

7641
03:33:44,220 --> 03:33:44,761
You know what I'm saying?

7642
03:33:44,761 --> 03:33:45,320
Like what?

7643
03:33:45,320 --> 03:33:47,290
What would be the point of
flying to Africa to hunt?

7644
03:33:47,310 --> 03:33:48,540
I don't question that shit.

7645
03:33:48,541 --> 03:33:48,960
Okay.

7646
03:33:48,960 --> 03:33:49,160
No,

7647
03:33:49,160 --> 03:33:49,890
it's a,

7648
03:33:49,890 --> 03:33:51,480
I mean for me it's a challenge.

7649
03:33:51,540 --> 03:33:52,530
It's new countries,

7650
03:33:52,531 --> 03:33:53,281
new culture.

7651
03:33:53,281 --> 03:33:54,690
It's experiencing new things,

7652
03:33:54,900 --> 03:33:56,370
but like you don't eat the hippo meet,

7653
03:33:56,371 --> 03:33:56,670
right?

7654
03:33:56,670 --> 03:33:57,540
Or do you know,

7655
03:33:57,690 --> 03:33:57,991
well,

7656
03:33:57,991 --> 03:33:58,824
the hippo meat,

7657
03:33:58,920 --> 03:34:00,900
there's tons of hippos
over killed the hippo.

7658
03:34:00,960 --> 03:34:01,171
No,

7659
03:34:01,171 --> 03:34:02,004
I haven't.

7660
03:34:02,240 --> 03:34:02,470
No,

7661
03:34:02,470 --> 03:34:04,530
I haven't been more post scare.

7662
03:34:04,790 --> 03:34:05,623
Oh,

7663
03:34:06,170 --> 03:34:06,961
you killed the hippo.

7664
03:34:06,961 --> 03:34:09,930
Would you put the meat in
the freezer and ship it back?

7665
03:34:10,140 --> 03:34:12,180
Apparently now hippo tastes good.

7666
03:34:12,230 --> 03:34:13,320
You can leave now.

7667
03:34:14,040 --> 03:34:15,090
Supposedly tastes good too.

7668
03:34:15,240 --> 03:34:16,073
Here's how it works.

7669
03:34:16,360 --> 03:34:17,370
It's crazy right now.

7670
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:18,870
Here's how it works.

7671
03:34:18,871 --> 03:34:19,770
People on the planet,

7672
03:34:19,800 --> 03:34:20,633
I could tell you dude,

7673
03:34:20,750 --> 03:34:21,930
dude named Corey Knowlton,

7674
03:34:21,931 --> 03:34:22,764
he was on the podcast.

7675
03:34:23,250 --> 03:34:28,250
He's a famous guy who went over to
Africa and paid something like $250,000.

7676
03:34:29,770 --> 03:34:30,603
Second time.

7677
03:34:31,640 --> 03:34:32,160
Yeah.

7678
03:34:32,160 --> 03:34:33,750
He took me to kill a rhino.

7679
03:34:33,960 --> 03:34:35,820
He shot this black rhino.

7680
03:34:35,970 --> 03:34:36,803
That was,

7681
03:34:36,870 --> 03:34:41,430
it was a male rhino that was too old to
breed and it was killing other rhinos.

7682
03:34:41,490 --> 03:34:42,780
Is this HIPAA threat to this?

7683
03:34:43,170 --> 03:34:44,003
Fuck yeah.

7684
03:34:46,900 --> 03:34:49,110
No Tanzania.

7685
03:34:49,111 --> 03:34:51,590
You gotta you gotta you
can't get bit by a hippo.

7686
03:34:53,200 --> 03:34:54,960
Hippo step on it.

7687
03:34:55,290 --> 03:34:56,123
Definitely.

7688
03:34:56,200 --> 03:34:56,760
Yeah.

7689
03:34:56,760 --> 03:34:57,593
Right.

7690
03:34:57,770 --> 03:34:58,770
So in Tanzania,

7691
03:34:58,771 --> 03:34:59,161
here's,

7692
03:34:59,161 --> 03:35:01,140
here's how dire it is over there.

7693
03:35:01,320 --> 03:35:02,640
All they want is protein.

7694
03:35:02,641 --> 03:35:05,000
So whatever you kill people.

7695
03:35:05,010 --> 03:35:05,843
The value.

7696
03:35:06,310 --> 03:35:06,540
Yeah.

7697
03:35:06,540 --> 03:35:08,310
The people that live in Tanzania that the,

7698
03:35:08,311 --> 03:35:08,990
uh,

7699
03:35:08,990 --> 03:35:09,600
the natives,

7700
03:35:09,600 --> 03:35:11,130
that's Australian or African?

7701
03:35:11,190 --> 03:35:11,431
No,

7702
03:35:11,431 --> 03:35:11,581
no,

7703
03:35:11,581 --> 03:35:11,791
no.

7704
03:35:11,791 --> 03:35:13,290
Tanzania is Africa.

7705
03:35:13,320 --> 03:35:14,153
Africa.

7706
03:35:14,160 --> 03:35:14,993
Um,

7707
03:35:15,330 --> 03:35:15,660
here's,

7708
03:35:15,660 --> 03:35:16,530
here's an example.

7709
03:35:16,531 --> 03:35:19,260
We were over there hunting and there was,

7710
03:35:19,570 --> 03:35:20,341
there was,

7711
03:35:20,341 --> 03:35:20,790
um,

7712
03:35:20,790 --> 03:35:21,830
Tanzanians there.

7713
03:35:21,850 --> 03:35:22,683
What were you hunting?

7714
03:35:23,280 --> 03:35:26,850
I was hunting a lion.

7715
03:35:26,851 --> 03:35:28,320
Buffalo monkeys did.

7716
03:35:28,321 --> 03:35:29,154
Did you see any of that?

7717
03:35:29,280 --> 03:35:30,380
Do you see any lines or,

7718
03:35:31,520 --> 03:35:32,730
I never got shot at a lion.

7719
03:35:32,830 --> 03:35:33,663
Killed the baboons.

7720
03:35:33,680 --> 03:35:34,230
Yeah.

7721
03:35:34,230 --> 03:35:35,070
Oh my God.

7722
03:35:35,190 --> 03:35:36,001
See the lions,

7723
03:35:36,001 --> 03:35:38,430
the line thing is where
people get pissed off.

7724
03:35:38,440 --> 03:35:39,210
Did you kill him?

7725
03:35:39,210 --> 03:35:40,950
He just shot him like he'd be hanging out

7726
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:45,630
and it lands baboons,

7727
03:35:46,260 --> 03:35:46,711
baboons,

7728
03:35:46,711 --> 03:35:47,490
tear stuff up.

7729
03:35:47,490 --> 03:35:48,091
Baboons.

7730
03:35:48,091 --> 03:35:50,100
Actually we'll go into,

7731
03:35:50,590 --> 03:35:51,690
so they live in grass,

7732
03:35:51,960 --> 03:35:53,040
grass huts over there.

7733
03:35:53,220 --> 03:35:56,820
They've been known to go in there
and like bite on babies' heads,

7734
03:35:56,830 --> 03:35:58,850
fossils there things.

7735
03:35:59,200 --> 03:36:02,670
There things are this
long about Boone is nasty.

7736
03:36:02,800 --> 03:36:04,290
So do you shoot it on spot?

7737
03:36:04,350 --> 03:36:04,880
I'm with,

7738
03:36:04,880 --> 03:36:05,310
yeah.

7739
03:36:05,310 --> 03:36:05,970
Oh Wow.

7740
03:36:05,970 --> 03:36:07,040
That's so crazy.

7741
03:36:07,050 --> 03:36:08,100
So anyway,

7742
03:36:08,190 --> 03:36:10,500
the person is like a monkey fucked a dog.

7743
03:36:10,560 --> 03:36:13,450
There's poachers over there that will,

7744
03:36:14,270 --> 03:36:15,150
you have a baby.

7745
03:36:15,390 --> 03:36:16,223
You got to

7746
03:36:17,440 --> 03:36:19,440
get to my bathroom before they drown.

7747
03:36:19,640 --> 03:36:20,000
There's,

7748
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:20,833
there's uh,

7749
03:36:21,210 --> 03:36:23,040
the poachers over there is like,

7750
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:23,970
when you,

7751
03:36:23,970 --> 03:36:25,920
when you would see a poach or with a gun,

7752
03:36:26,070 --> 03:36:28,440
it was almost like
whoever could shoot first.

7753
03:36:28,890 --> 03:36:30,090
They wanted to shoot at you.

7754
03:36:31,110 --> 03:36:33,090
We had a man who wanted a shooter.

7755
03:36:33,100 --> 03:36:33,840
You Poach.

7756
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:34,673
Poach roasters.

7757
03:36:35,020 --> 03:36:35,510
You,

7758
03:36:35,510 --> 03:36:36,343
yeah.

7759
03:36:36,550 --> 03:36:37,410
Anybody you are,

7760
03:36:37,980 --> 03:36:38,980
they're getting caught.

7761
03:36:38,981 --> 03:36:39,814
Poaching.

7762
03:36:40,810 --> 03:36:41,380
Right.

7763
03:36:41,380 --> 03:36:43,150
And so it's almost like the wild west.

7764
03:36:43,180 --> 03:36:44,060
God Damn.

7765
03:36:44,110 --> 03:36:44,450
Yeah.

7766
03:36:44,450 --> 03:36:46,450
And all they're trying to get his meat.

7767
03:36:46,630 --> 03:36:47,463
Okay.

7768
03:36:47,600 --> 03:36:48,130
And say,

7769
03:36:48,130 --> 03:36:48,461
okay,

7770
03:36:48,461 --> 03:36:48,850
meet,

7771
03:36:48,850 --> 03:36:49,683
meet good.

7772
03:36:49,780 --> 03:36:50,830
They want protein.

7773
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:52,150
So they would go,

7774
03:36:52,151 --> 03:36:53,170
they'd go into land.

7775
03:36:53,171 --> 03:36:54,250
They're not supposed to be on.

7776
03:36:54,370 --> 03:36:55,420
How do they know you're cool?

7777
03:36:55,421 --> 03:36:56,590
What does that process like?

7778
03:36:56,620 --> 03:36:56,770
They,

7779
03:36:56,770 --> 03:36:57,130
they,

7780
03:36:57,130 --> 03:36:58,870
they don't go like this.

7781
03:36:58,871 --> 03:36:59,470
Right?

7782
03:36:59,470 --> 03:37:00,190
You go like this.

7783
03:37:00,190 --> 03:37:01,000
No,

7784
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:01,900
you don't do this.

7785
03:37:01,930 --> 03:37:02,201
No,

7786
03:37:02,201 --> 03:37:03,610
because they point the gun at you.

7787
03:37:03,611 --> 03:37:04,780
They're not supposed to be there.

7788
03:37:05,440 --> 03:37:06,460
So Walter Poachers,

7789
03:37:06,461 --> 03:37:07,570
is that what happens then?

7790
03:37:07,571 --> 03:37:08,530
What's the situation?

7791
03:37:08,950 --> 03:37:10,910
The point a gun at them and are

7792
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:14,740
the first experience that we had is,

7793
03:37:14,741 --> 03:37:15,574
I saw this,

7794
03:37:15,640 --> 03:37:16,301
this guy,

7795
03:37:16,301 --> 03:37:17,200
he was crossed,

7796
03:37:17,260 --> 03:37:17,600
I don't know,

7797
03:37:17,600 --> 03:37:19,450
150 yards away and I,

7798
03:37:19,460 --> 03:37:21,490
the guy I was with is
who I was hunting with.

7799
03:37:21,491 --> 03:37:22,324
His name was Ryan.

7800
03:37:22,600 --> 03:37:23,170
And I said,

7801
03:37:23,170 --> 03:37:24,010
I see a man.

7802
03:37:24,490 --> 03:37:24,821
And he goes,

7803
03:37:24,821 --> 03:37:25,151
where?

7804
03:37:25,151 --> 03:37:25,690
I said,

7805
03:37:25,690 --> 03:37:27,220
there's a man right there,

7806
03:37:27,280 --> 03:37:27,490
you know,

7807
03:37:27,490 --> 03:37:28,210
it was a black guy.

7808
03:37:28,210 --> 03:37:31,390
He had all all brown stuff on racist.

7809
03:37:31,420 --> 03:37:32,080
And uh,

7810
03:37:32,080 --> 03:37:32,913
I said,

7811
03:37:33,100 --> 03:37:33,431
I go,

7812
03:37:33,431 --> 03:37:35,470
he's got a gun and he goes,

7813
03:37:35,950 --> 03:37:37,000
get behind this tree.

7814
03:37:37,300 --> 03:37:37,691
And I said,

7815
03:37:37,691 --> 03:37:38,560
are we going to get shot?

7816
03:37:38,920 --> 03:37:40,420
And he goes to stay behind the tree.

7817
03:37:41,020 --> 03:37:44,170
And so the guy circled around and came,

7818
03:37:44,260 --> 03:37:47,640
he was 150 yards away then and he came
to 50 yards and you standing there

7819
03:37:47,690 --> 03:37:50,590
staring with his gun and uh,

7820
03:37:50,650 --> 03:37:51,670
he said he's a poacher.

7821
03:37:52,030 --> 03:37:53,940
The guys were said he's a poacher.

7822
03:37:53,950 --> 03:37:54,850
This guy never talked.

7823
03:37:55,390 --> 03:37:58,180
Finally he melted back into the trees
and I was standing there and I said,

7824
03:37:58,181 --> 03:38:00,010
I see two more guys up in the rocks.

7825
03:38:00,520 --> 03:38:02,470
And they were hiding in the
rocks and they took off running.

7826
03:38:02,860 --> 03:38:06,370
So I went up to their camp
and they had all this,

7827
03:38:06,371 --> 03:38:06,670
uh,

7828
03:38:06,670 --> 03:38:06,911
you know,

7829
03:38:06,911 --> 03:38:08,210
the witch doctor had told him,

7830
03:38:08,211 --> 03:38:09,700
if you put powder on your wrist,

7831
03:38:09,701 --> 03:38:10,630
you're going to be invisible.

7832
03:38:10,630 --> 03:38:14,020
So that guy probably thought he was
invisible because the witch doctor of the

7833
03:38:14,021 --> 03:38:17,410
village told him you went to their camp,

7834
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:20,110
you didn't go back to your
goddamn car and take the fuck off.

7835
03:38:20,330 --> 03:38:20,980
No,

7836
03:38:20,980 --> 03:38:22,540
just camp to the camp.

7837
03:38:22,541 --> 03:38:23,650
And I got hold their stuff.

7838
03:38:24,010 --> 03:38:28,780
And the reason why he didn't shoot it
150 yards is because they don't have any

7839
03:38:28,781 --> 03:38:29,141
ammo.

7840
03:38:29,141 --> 03:38:30,250
So they have a rifle,

7841
03:38:30,340 --> 03:38:31,173
but they have to,

7842
03:38:31,210 --> 03:38:33,310
they have to make it into
a firearm essentially.

7843
03:38:33,311 --> 03:38:35,410
So they have to stuff
ball bearings down there,

7844
03:38:35,411 --> 03:38:37,030
old school firing,

7845
03:38:37,031 --> 03:38:37,510
Pin,

7846
03:38:37,510 --> 03:38:39,220
the civil war and you're fucking right.

7847
03:38:39,221 --> 03:38:39,980
Gum powers,

7848
03:38:39,980 --> 03:38:42,640
they have to be safe 40 yards away.

7849
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:47,590
And he was got that close and saw the
Guy Ryan who I was with had a high power

7850
03:38:47,830 --> 03:38:49,360
rifle with a scope and he's like,

7851
03:38:49,361 --> 03:38:52,000
well I'm out gunned here
is what he is thinking,

7852
03:38:52,001 --> 03:38:52,480
I'm assuming.

7853
03:38:52,480 --> 03:38:53,171
And he took off.

7854
03:38:53,171 --> 03:38:54,910
Then the guys he's with took off and all,

7855
03:38:54,911 --> 03:38:59,440
they had the head of burlap sacks with
wire harnesses to put over there like a

7856
03:38:59,441 --> 03:39:01,810
backstrap in a burlap sack.

7857
03:39:01,870 --> 03:39:02,230
Yeah,

7858
03:39:02,230 --> 03:39:03,640
the burlap sack races.

7859
03:39:04,510 --> 03:39:04,781
Yeah,

7860
03:39:04,781 --> 03:39:05,351
exactly.

7861
03:39:05,351 --> 03:39:06,700
And so they would kill an animal.

7862
03:39:06,701 --> 03:39:07,534
They'd poach it,

7863
03:39:07,720 --> 03:39:09,130
they'd cut the meat off,

7864
03:39:09,131 --> 03:39:12,130
they'd hang it on branches
or rope and dry it out,

7865
03:39:12,340 --> 03:39:14,120
and then they'd take that meat.

7866
03:39:14,520 --> 03:39:16,150
They just called protein in a,

7867
03:39:16,230 --> 03:39:16,990
put it in the borough,

7868
03:39:16,990 --> 03:39:17,741
burlap sack,

7869
03:39:17,741 --> 03:39:20,020
take hike all the way back
to the village and sell it.

7870
03:39:20,490 --> 03:39:21,810
And what do they leave the,

7871
03:39:22,120 --> 03:39:23,140
the head and everything?

7872
03:39:23,170 --> 03:39:23,411
Yeah,

7873
03:39:23,411 --> 03:39:24,101
just bones.

7874
03:39:24,101 --> 03:39:24,940
You know what you can't eat.

7875
03:39:25,120 --> 03:39:25,840
So anyway,

7876
03:39:25,840 --> 03:39:28,330
that's when you talk
about killing animals,

7877
03:39:28,331 --> 03:39:30,610
they will gladly take
the animals you kill.

7878
03:39:31,150 --> 03:39:31,983
You know what I mean?

7879
03:39:32,080 --> 03:39:33,830
And as far as for hunting goes,

7880
03:39:33,831 --> 03:39:34,131
you say,

7881
03:39:34,131 --> 03:39:35,220
well why would you want to go?

7882
03:39:35,280 --> 03:39:36,480
I mentioned why I would go,

7883
03:39:36,700 --> 03:39:39,460
but it also is the only
economy they have over there.

7884
03:39:39,820 --> 03:39:41,140
You know in Tanzania,

7885
03:39:42,120 --> 03:39:43,360
one monkey meetings,

7886
03:39:43,361 --> 03:39:44,194
they will need that.

7887
03:39:44,370 --> 03:39:44,740
No,

7888
03:39:44,740 --> 03:39:45,573
some of them do.

7889
03:39:45,580 --> 03:39:47,650
You said this is the only
reason you said is the,

7890
03:39:48,130 --> 03:39:50,220
is the only economy they have out hunting,

7891
03:39:50,221 --> 03:39:50,560
hunting,

7892
03:39:50,560 --> 03:39:51,670
hunting trophies.

7893
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:53,620
People.

7894
03:39:53,620 --> 03:39:54,620
People would call it trophy,

7895
03:39:55,310 --> 03:39:55,890
but it's just,

7896
03:39:55,890 --> 03:39:58,490
it's just hunters from
abroad going there and,

7897
03:39:58,570 --> 03:40:01,800
and putting money in
the economy challenge.

7898
03:40:02,170 --> 03:40:03,003
Is that why you go with it?

7899
03:40:03,010 --> 03:40:04,150
Cause it's the ultimate challenge.

7900
03:40:04,260 --> 03:40:04,591
Yeah.

7901
03:40:04,591 --> 03:40:04,951
I mean,

7902
03:40:04,951 --> 03:40:05,221
you know,

7903
03:40:05,221 --> 03:40:10,221
to kill a Cape Buffalo with
a bow and Arrow tato tough.

7904
03:40:11,010 --> 03:40:12,360
Those they call them black death.

7905
03:40:12,570 --> 03:40:14,040
Why they kill people.

7906
03:40:14,070 --> 03:40:14,700
Damn.

7907
03:40:14,700 --> 03:40:15,060
Yeah,

7908
03:40:15,060 --> 03:40:15,893
they're nasty.

7909
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:17,010
So you are you,

7910
03:40:17,011 --> 03:40:18,830
you know hunters that have died?

7911
03:40:19,650 --> 03:40:20,350
Um,

7912
03:40:20,350 --> 03:40:21,910
I don't know personally any,

7913
03:40:22,030 --> 03:40:24,730
I mean I have friends that
have died not over there,

7914
03:40:24,731 --> 03:40:25,564
but hunting.

7915
03:40:26,140 --> 03:40:26,980
They'd died hunting

7916
03:40:28,530 --> 03:40:29,890
a fell off a cliff.

7917
03:40:29,920 --> 03:40:31,210
That was my buddy right here,

7918
03:40:31,750 --> 03:40:32,110
Roy.

7919
03:40:32,110 --> 03:40:34,600
She was sheep hunting and um,

7920
03:40:34,630 --> 03:40:35,463
she putting,

7921
03:40:35,470 --> 03:40:35,741
yeah,

7922
03:40:35,741 --> 03:40:38,800
when you're is he was hunting
dall sheep up in Alaska.

7923
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:40,180
And uh,

7924
03:40:40,450 --> 03:40:40,631
you know,

7925
03:40:40,631 --> 03:40:41,890
when I talk about the challenge,

7926
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:43,090
that's why we do it.

7927
03:40:43,091 --> 03:40:46,850
We get up in the cliffs are those sheep
lives and live and he's with the bone

7928
03:40:46,870 --> 03:40:50,380
Arrow and one false step up there.

7929
03:40:50,381 --> 03:40:51,730
And that could be your last,

7930
03:40:51,731 --> 03:40:53,720
and that's what happened
to him a year ago.

7931
03:40:53,721 --> 03:40:54,190
Uh,

7932
03:40:54,190 --> 03:40:55,060
October 4th.

7933
03:40:55,180 --> 03:40:55,601
Damn.

7934
03:40:55,601 --> 03:40:56,470
That sucks man.

7935
03:40:56,770 --> 03:40:57,041
So,

7936
03:40:57,041 --> 03:40:57,790
but that's,

7937
03:40:57,790 --> 03:40:58,091
you know,

7938
03:40:58,091 --> 03:40:59,080
when we talk about,

7939
03:40:59,170 --> 03:40:59,441
you know,

7940
03:40:59,441 --> 03:41:00,640
you want to hunt black death,

7941
03:41:00,641 --> 03:41:03,460
you want to hunt a sheep in the mountains,

7942
03:41:03,700 --> 03:41:06,160
there's an inherit risk in doing that.

7943
03:41:06,510 --> 03:41:07,510
We understand that.

7944
03:41:07,750 --> 03:41:08,590
And that's part of,

7945
03:41:08,650 --> 03:41:09,700
that's part of the journey.

7946
03:41:09,730 --> 03:41:09,851
Yeah,

7947
03:41:09,851 --> 03:41:10,600
that makes sense.

7948
03:41:10,600 --> 03:41:11,433
So

7949
03:41:12,910 --> 03:41:13,121
it's,

7950
03:41:13,121 --> 03:41:15,970
so it's a weird thing

7951
03:41:16,070 --> 03:41:21,070
to be a person aware of all the things
that you need to consume to stay alive,

7952
03:41:22,830 --> 03:41:23,260
you know,

7953
03:41:23,260 --> 03:41:25,160
stick with you guys when shit goes down.

7954
03:41:25,161 --> 03:41:26,110
Can I have your number and

7955
03:41:27,690 --> 03:41:27,980
said,

7956
03:41:27,980 --> 03:41:28,170
hey,

7957
03:41:28,170 --> 03:41:30,220
I've got skills.

7958
03:41:30,260 --> 03:41:31,340
I got Joe Rogan now.

7959
03:41:31,341 --> 03:41:32,174
I got you.

7960
03:41:32,390 --> 03:41:33,180
I'm not talking,

7961
03:41:33,180 --> 03:41:34,340
talking about my family,

7962
03:41:34,341 --> 03:41:34,860
you know what I mean?

7963
03:41:34,860 --> 03:41:35,381
Are you doing,

7964
03:41:35,381 --> 03:41:36,680
you know all I want a job.

7965
03:41:36,950 --> 03:41:38,120
You're secret service.

7966
03:41:38,121 --> 03:41:39,200
You run your brother.

7967
03:41:39,440 --> 03:41:40,670
I told you you're my Dana White.

7968
03:41:41,690 --> 03:41:44,200
You need me to choke anybody out ride,

7969
03:41:44,780 --> 03:41:45,920
which is build my house.

7970
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:48,920
I make my food for me and anybody.

7971
03:41:48,921 --> 03:41:53,630
I'll be your secret service
to get to help plan the,

7972
03:41:53,890 --> 03:41:55,640
if I had it was head of security,

7973
03:41:55,641 --> 03:41:57,290
no motherfucker would get in ever

7974
03:42:01,430 --> 03:42:03,030
double cross zone.

7975
03:42:03,900 --> 03:42:04,380
Let's,

7976
03:42:04,380 --> 03:42:08,690
let's really check into everything
he says to Trump government.

7977
03:42:08,810 --> 03:42:09,261
The government,

7978
03:42:09,261 --> 03:42:12,390
everybody agrees that the criminals
let's check into everything,

7979
03:42:12,391 --> 03:42:13,010
less everything.

7980
03:42:13,010 --> 03:42:13,843
They say,

7981
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:14,570
let's,

7982
03:42:14,570 --> 03:42:16,970
let's look into what the
fuck they're really saying.

7983
03:42:17,180 --> 03:42:18,020
What's wrong with that?

7984
03:42:18,320 --> 03:42:18,711
Oh No,

7985
03:42:18,711 --> 03:42:19,880
let's just believe what they're saying.

7986
03:42:19,940 --> 03:42:20,151
Oh yeah.

7987
03:42:20,151 --> 03:42:21,080
One more crush for Camden.

7988
03:42:21,081 --> 03:42:21,741
And you guys can talk.

7989
03:42:21,741 --> 03:42:22,530
Conspiracies.

7990
03:42:22,530 --> 03:42:22,791
No,

7991
03:42:22,791 --> 03:42:22,911
no,

7992
03:42:22,911 --> 03:42:23,190
no.

7993
03:42:23,190 --> 03:42:25,370
Just cause I've never been a hunter.

7994
03:42:25,371 --> 03:42:26,300
I've never been around hunting.

7995
03:42:26,330 --> 03:42:28,310
You grew up hunting like as a kid?

7996
03:42:28,510 --> 03:42:29,180
Um,

7997
03:42:29,180 --> 03:42:29,870
no.

7998
03:42:29,870 --> 03:42:30,620
You know,

7999
03:42:30,620 --> 03:42:31,650
my dad didn't hunt.

8000
03:42:31,651 --> 03:42:32,040
He was an

8001
03:42:32,040 --> 03:42:33,480
athlete and uh,

8002
03:42:33,660 --> 03:42:34,740
so yeah,

8003
03:42:35,400 --> 03:42:35,971
so he,

8004
03:42:35,971 --> 03:42:36,690
uh,

8005
03:42:36,690 --> 03:42:37,411
he didn't hunt.

8006
03:42:37,411 --> 03:42:40,110
He aren't and on just wasn't part of it.

8007
03:42:40,111 --> 03:42:40,890
So,

8008
03:42:40,890 --> 03:42:41,161
um,

8009
03:42:41,161 --> 03:42:45,300
my mom and dad got divorced and my Stepdad
got me started in hunting or I was 15

8010
03:42:45,301 --> 03:42:46,134
years old.

8011
03:42:46,640 --> 03:42:47,350
That's when I start.

8012
03:42:47,350 --> 03:42:47,480
So,

8013
03:42:47,480 --> 03:42:47,690
yeah.

8014
03:42:47,690 --> 03:42:50,880
So it's not like you grew up knowing
or being around it and that's nuts.

8015
03:42:50,940 --> 03:42:51,390
No.

8016
03:42:51,390 --> 03:42:52,530
So then my buddy Roy,

8017
03:42:52,531 --> 03:42:53,364
who died,

8018
03:42:53,430 --> 03:42:53,671
uh,

8019
03:42:53,671 --> 03:42:54,061
he,

8020
03:42:54,061 --> 03:42:54,331
uh,

8021
03:42:54,331 --> 03:42:56,640
introduced me to bow
hunting when I was 18,

8022
03:42:56,910 --> 03:42:58,380
and then that's all I've done since then.

8023
03:42:59,190 --> 03:42:59,931
Do you feel the rush,

8024
03:42:59,931 --> 03:43:00,764
is that like,

8025
03:43:01,140 --> 03:43:02,820
no matter what the fuck goes down,

8026
03:43:03,090 --> 03:43:04,170
you're going to be able to eat?

8027
03:43:05,070 --> 03:43:05,461
Yeah,

8028
03:43:05,461 --> 03:43:06,640
no rush right now.

8029
03:43:06,650 --> 03:43:07,483
Hunting,

8030
03:43:07,610 --> 03:43:11,610
hunting has given me confidence in all
aspects of life because I've overcome so

8031
03:43:11,611 --> 03:43:12,690
much out.

8032
03:43:12,740 --> 03:43:13,980
You know in the mountains,

8033
03:43:14,000 --> 03:43:16,630
you know that you guys can
go out and shit went down.

8034
03:43:16,650 --> 03:43:18,780
You went out to some stream and Colorado,

8035
03:43:19,110 --> 03:43:20,160
you're going to find a fine,

8036
03:43:20,500 --> 03:43:20,940
right?

8037
03:43:20,940 --> 03:43:21,271
Yeah.

8038
03:43:21,271 --> 03:43:22,920
Most likely I trust you.

8039
03:43:22,921 --> 03:43:24,840
So is the right by your side in a day.

8040
03:43:24,870 --> 03:43:26,730
Here's the reality of a day.

8041
03:43:26,731 --> 03:43:29,190
Like today it's 86 degrees.

8042
03:43:29,610 --> 03:43:31,140
If there's nothing going on,

8043
03:43:31,170 --> 03:43:32,820
if we don't have any refrigeration,

8044
03:43:33,240 --> 03:43:36,450
we're kind of fucked because
food's not going to last.

8045
03:43:36,570 --> 03:43:38,290
So you're going to have to
get it on a regular basis.

8046
03:43:38,291 --> 03:43:39,630
You're going to have to dry shit out.

8047
03:43:39,660 --> 03:43:43,200
You're going to have to have vegetables
like the African as in Tanzania or just

8048
03:43:43,201 --> 03:43:45,270
slap me down just like the settlers did.

8049
03:43:45,320 --> 03:43:47,080
I think I first came here and I tried to,

8050
03:43:47,910 --> 03:43:48,271
well they,

8051
03:43:48,271 --> 03:43:48,481
you know,

8052
03:43:48,481 --> 03:43:51,210
they decimated the animal
populations across the country.

8053
03:43:51,480 --> 03:43:55,460
I'm reading that Dan Flores
book about wolves or coyotes.

8054
03:43:56,070 --> 03:43:56,903
Coyotes,

8055
03:43:57,190 --> 03:43:58,023
coyotes.

8056
03:43:58,350 --> 03:43:58,681
Dude.

8057
03:43:58,681 --> 03:43:59,910
It's fucking incredible.

8058
03:44:00,270 --> 03:44:01,200
It's incredible.

8059
03:44:01,320 --> 03:44:01,781
When you,

8060
03:44:01,781 --> 03:44:02,021
you,

8061
03:44:02,021 --> 03:44:02,261
you,

8062
03:44:02,261 --> 03:44:02,500
you,

8063
03:44:02,500 --> 03:44:02,761
you,

8064
03:44:02,761 --> 03:44:05,240
you find out like what they did to,

8065
03:44:05,241 --> 03:44:06,074
uh,

8066
03:44:06,480 --> 03:44:06,721
well,

8067
03:44:06,721 --> 03:44:10,980
what they did to all the animals
across the United States after the war.

8068
03:44:11,120 --> 03:44:11,350
Well,

8069
03:44:11,350 --> 03:44:13,290
a bunch of people fucking watch war.

8070
03:44:13,291 --> 03:44:14,100
Was it her fashion?

8071
03:44:14,100 --> 03:44:14,821
American war?

8072
03:44:14,821 --> 03:44:15,610
Which war was it?

8073
03:44:15,610 --> 03:44:16,141
It should have been,

8074
03:44:16,141 --> 03:44:16,410
yeah,

8075
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:20,880
Spanish American war post
that the soldiers came back
and they needed a way to

8076
03:44:20,881 --> 03:44:21,511
make a living.

8077
03:44:21,511 --> 03:44:24,630
And one of the things they did is they
did what they called market hunting,

8078
03:44:25,320 --> 03:44:26,700
did grow across the country,

8079
03:44:26,730 --> 03:44:30,870
just shooting shit for stores and they
had a shoot shit all the time for what

8080
03:44:31,430 --> 03:44:32,070
stores?

8081
03:44:32,070 --> 03:44:32,661
For a store,

8082
03:44:32,661 --> 03:44:33,230
for sell,

8083
03:44:33,230 --> 03:44:34,590
for to sell them for me,

8084
03:44:34,950 --> 03:44:35,490
like with,

8085
03:44:35,490 --> 03:44:37,500
people had domesticated some animals,

8086
03:44:37,501 --> 03:44:40,890
but there was also a lot of money and
just shooting animals and getting to meet

8087
03:44:40,891 --> 03:44:42,480
out about where'd you get
this information from?

8088
03:44:42,481 --> 03:44:44,580
The library to this is all,

8089
03:44:44,640 --> 03:44:49,160
this is all from Dan [inaudible]
book and also he's a,

8090
03:44:49,200 --> 03:44:50,250
he's a professor?

8091
03:44:50,400 --> 03:44:50,641
No,

8092
03:44:50,641 --> 03:44:50,821
no,

8093
03:44:50,821 --> 03:44:51,001
no.

8094
03:44:51,001 --> 03:44:54,060
Dan Flores is a professor
and he used to be,

8095
03:44:54,061 --> 03:44:59,040
Steve Rinella is a professor
and he was in some sort of a,

8096
03:44:59,041 --> 03:45:00,630
a natural history.

8097
03:45:00,750 --> 03:45:01,650
Um,

8098
03:45:02,070 --> 03:45:02,580
uh,

8099
03:45:02,580 --> 03:45:03,001
class,

8100
03:45:03,001 --> 03:45:04,050
I believe it was.

8101
03:45:04,410 --> 03:45:04,711
Anyway,

8102
03:45:04,711 --> 03:45:09,060
he's like a wildlife historian
so he understands like
the history of wildlife in

8103
03:45:09,061 --> 03:45:12,990
this country and he's like up to the
latest information as far as like what

8104
03:45:12,991 --> 03:45:15,420
animals evolved here and
where they spread out,

8105
03:45:15,421 --> 03:45:16,380
where they came back.

8106
03:45:16,860 --> 03:45:18,690
It's fascinating shit.

8107
03:45:18,900 --> 03:45:19,641
So he was on Rinella,

8108
03:45:19,641 --> 03:45:23,250
his podcasts and he was talking about how
they just went across the country just

8109
03:45:23,251 --> 03:45:24,570
wiping out antelope,

8110
03:45:24,600 --> 03:45:25,620
just wiping them out,

8111
03:45:25,840 --> 03:45:27,150
just wiping out buffalo,

8112
03:45:27,151 --> 03:45:30,160
wiping them out and they just
take that and sell it to market

8113
03:45:30,160 --> 03:45:33,370
and they just wasn't
part of it is because it,

8114
03:45:33,450 --> 03:45:36,190
it had to be fresh all the time
basically because we could keep it,

8115
03:45:36,430 --> 03:45:36,641
you know,

8116
03:45:36,641 --> 03:45:40,150
it's no different than a mountain
lion killing every three days.

8117
03:45:40,430 --> 03:45:41,710
They like to eat fresh meat.

8118
03:45:41,770 --> 03:45:42,610
In their defense.

8119
03:45:42,611 --> 03:45:44,840
They didn't know they were going
to kill all the God damn man was,

8120
03:45:44,841 --> 03:45:46,240
I probably thought it was
going to last forever.

8121
03:45:46,260 --> 03:45:48,700
So they probably didn't have a
good accurate account of them.

8122
03:45:48,701 --> 03:45:49,530
That's for sure.

8123
03:45:49,530 --> 03:45:50,830
There was this got a family,

8124
03:45:50,831 --> 03:45:54,250
they're trying to make some phone
nowadays there's a conservation mindset.

8125
03:45:54,251 --> 03:45:56,950
So we have the ability to look at numbers.

8126
03:45:56,951 --> 03:45:58,840
We look at caring capacity for the,

8127
03:45:58,870 --> 03:45:59,460
for the land,

8128
03:45:59,460 --> 03:46:00,450
and so we can kill.

8129
03:46:02,640 --> 03:46:03,940
It's like you will dream date.

8130
03:46:04,080 --> 03:46:05,050
What's your dream killed?

8131
03:46:05,051 --> 03:46:05,351
Come on.

8132
03:46:05,351 --> 03:46:09,850
You know you got one man has got to be
something that you want to kill before

8133
03:46:09,851 --> 03:46:10,480
you die.

8134
03:46:10,480 --> 03:46:10,691
Well,

8135
03:46:10,691 --> 03:46:10,961
no,

8136
03:46:10,961 --> 03:46:15,280
I mean a human and now I like elk hunting.

8137
03:46:15,310 --> 03:46:18,460
If I only could hunt elk or
one animal the rest of my life,

8138
03:46:18,461 --> 03:46:18,940
it'd be elk.

8139
03:46:18,940 --> 03:46:21,370
And that's what we were
doing and fish and shit.

8140
03:46:21,730 --> 03:46:22,121
Nothing.

8141
03:46:22,121 --> 03:46:22,870
None of that stuff.

8142
03:46:22,870 --> 03:46:24,250
You don't want to go out into that.

8143
03:46:24,280 --> 03:46:25,660
I'm into bone fish.

8144
03:46:25,830 --> 03:46:27,130
He's a socialist.

8145
03:46:27,400 --> 03:46:27,671
Okay,

8146
03:46:27,671 --> 03:46:28,960
so the ultimate is an elk.

8147
03:46:28,990 --> 03:46:29,823
What about you?

8148
03:46:29,990 --> 03:46:33,490
It's the same no belt grill
that the number one on the list.

8149
03:46:35,810 --> 03:46:36,643
The grizzly.

8150
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:38,980
You want to be able to
eat and you save the head.

8151
03:46:39,460 --> 03:46:40,030
Oh yeah.

8152
03:46:40,030 --> 03:46:41,080
He put her in the cabin.

8153
03:46:41,420 --> 03:46:42,253
Every cabin

8154
03:46:47,050 --> 03:46:49,510
on the fucking wall or on the floor.

8155
03:46:51,550 --> 03:46:53,560
The first one you got to
fucking news everything.

8156
03:46:54,460 --> 03:46:54,940
You're like,

8157
03:46:54,940 --> 03:46:56,340
I already got a goddamn right.

8158
03:46:57,440 --> 03:46:58,273
Hey,

8159
03:46:58,810 --> 03:46:59,950
you just saved the head.

8160
03:47:01,360 --> 03:47:02,193
Keep it all,

8161
03:47:02,380 --> 03:47:03,041
keep it off.

8162
03:47:03,041 --> 03:47:03,874
Every long,

8163
03:47:04,470 --> 03:47:05,081
Oh wait a minute.

8164
03:47:05,081 --> 03:47:05,914
You sell.

8165
03:47:06,130 --> 03:47:08,350
We sell now you can actually,

8166
03:47:08,530 --> 03:47:09,380
but you're so right

8167
03:47:11,320 --> 03:47:12,280
and you kill a bear.

8168
03:47:12,520 --> 03:47:13,630
Put her on Instagram.

8169
03:47:14,720 --> 03:47:17,790
That's 6,000 that I've
done that many times.

8170
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:19,810
We get real bad.

8171
03:47:22,870 --> 03:47:24,200
You get a ton of hate on Instagram.

8172
03:47:24,360 --> 03:47:25,560
Post Han Jamie show.

8173
03:47:25,630 --> 03:47:26,980
Show a show.

8174
03:47:26,981 --> 03:47:29,800
Eddie that bear paw my answer.

8175
03:47:29,810 --> 03:47:30,250
Now,

8176
03:47:30,250 --> 03:47:31,820
what's the biggest barrier?

8177
03:47:31,840 --> 03:47:32,980
Killed polar bear.

8178
03:47:33,300 --> 03:47:33,631
No,

8179
03:47:33,631 --> 03:47:34,361
it's a brown bear.

8180
03:47:34,361 --> 03:47:36,010
It's a nine nine foot.

8181
03:47:36,011 --> 03:47:37,870
Six inches can kill polar bear.

8182
03:47:40,800 --> 03:47:42,490
Put your mind into it and he said,

8183
03:47:42,491 --> 03:47:43,240
fuck it.

8184
03:47:43,240 --> 03:47:44,560
I'm going to fucking evolve.

8185
03:47:44,770 --> 03:47:45,880
We're going to do the snow.

8186
03:47:46,180 --> 03:47:47,540
We're going to fucking did.

8187
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:48,401
We'll get a break.

8188
03:47:48,401 --> 03:47:49,234
New Ground.

8189
03:47:49,330 --> 03:47:50,230
That's fake

8190
03:47:51,770 --> 03:47:53,260
photo shot too.

8191
03:47:53,270 --> 03:47:54,790
That's not real calm.

8192
03:47:56,700 --> 03:47:58,180
Look at that fucking Paul.

8193
03:47:58,480 --> 03:47:59,620
Where'd you catch them slipping?

8194
03:47:59,710 --> 03:48:00,543
No Way.

8195
03:48:04,960 --> 03:48:05,600
Fuck man.

8196
03:48:05,600 --> 03:48:06,130
One Boehner.

8197
03:48:06,130 --> 03:48:06,850
It killed him.

8198
03:48:06,850 --> 03:48:07,600
One shot.

8199
03:48:07,600 --> 03:48:08,070
Wait,

8200
03:48:08,070 --> 03:48:08,903
where do you hit on that?

8201
03:48:09,160 --> 03:48:09,993
Right in the lungs.

8202
03:48:10,320 --> 03:48:11,153
Damn.

8203
03:48:11,290 --> 03:48:12,190
One shot.

8204
03:48:12,220 --> 03:48:13,600
It's an optical illusion.

8205
03:48:13,601 --> 03:48:16,330
You know you hold it so close to
the camera at appears big butt.

8206
03:48:16,331 --> 03:48:17,440
Your head because your head,

8207
03:48:17,890 --> 03:48:22,090
because there's looks that
looks like it's nine feet tall.

8208
03:48:22,210 --> 03:48:25,360
What was it that normal that
bear was nine foot six inches.

8209
03:48:26,840 --> 03:48:27,161
See,

8210
03:48:27,161 --> 03:48:27,400
I didn't,

8211
03:48:27,400 --> 03:48:28,040
what was the meat?

8212
03:48:28,040 --> 03:48:28,873
Good.

8213
03:48:28,920 --> 03:48:29,350
I mean,

8214
03:48:29,350 --> 03:48:30,410
it's not very good on those.

8215
03:48:30,560 --> 03:48:31,241
Oh my God.

8216
03:48:31,241 --> 03:48:32,074
Even really sick.

8217
03:48:32,790 --> 03:48:34,010
Well Cook right me.

8218
03:48:34,011 --> 03:48:34,340
Right.

8219
03:48:34,340 --> 03:48:36,620
You get really strict about tricking.

8220
03:48:36,621 --> 03:48:38,630
Gnosis how many times
did you have to hit it?

8221
03:48:38,680 --> 03:48:40,550
Just one Arrow in the head.

8222
03:48:40,730 --> 03:48:41,430
No,

8223
03:48:41,430 --> 03:48:42,550
went out right in the heart.

8224
03:48:42,560 --> 03:48:43,393
Lungs.

8225
03:48:43,730 --> 03:48:45,260
The lungs take out the lungs.

8226
03:48:45,460 --> 03:48:47,150
God Damn Long.

8227
03:48:47,160 --> 03:48:48,350
It's two minutes.

8228
03:48:48,351 --> 03:48:49,184
Three minutes.

8229
03:48:49,310 --> 03:48:50,000
No.

8230
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:50,810
Um,

8231
03:48:50,810 --> 03:48:51,111
let's see.

8232
03:48:51,111 --> 03:48:54,470
That one was dead and about 30 seconds.

8233
03:48:54,530 --> 03:48:55,363
What?

8234
03:48:55,850 --> 03:48:56,690
You didn't have to go up,

8235
03:48:56,720 --> 03:48:57,790
go kneel on the band.

8236
03:48:57,791 --> 03:48:58,041
I'm in.

8237
03:48:58,041 --> 03:49:00,350
Throw some old d tours down in the belly.

8238
03:49:00,770 --> 03:49:05,770
It's hard for people to imagine that
you need to control the population of

8239
03:49:06,531 --> 03:49:07,550
certain animals.

8240
03:49:07,700 --> 03:49:08,380
It's hard for,

8241
03:49:08,380 --> 03:49:08,950
that's,

8242
03:49:08,950 --> 03:49:10,400
that's a weird one for people.

8243
03:49:10,450 --> 03:49:10,700
Yeah.

8244
03:49:10,700 --> 03:49:11,810
It's like you're not going to eat it,

8245
03:49:11,811 --> 03:49:12,770
but you need to kill it.

8246
03:49:12,800 --> 03:49:13,940
Why do you guys need to kill it?

8247
03:49:13,970 --> 03:49:14,210
Yeah.

8248
03:49:14,210 --> 03:49:17,670
I mentioned that today and
too confusing conversations.

8249
03:49:17,680 --> 03:49:18,620
He would get upset.

8250
03:49:18,680 --> 03:49:19,610
I love bears.

8251
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:21,350
They're beautiful and all that shit,

8252
03:49:21,830 --> 03:49:22,663
but hey,

8253
03:49:22,820 --> 03:49:23,653
you know what?

8254
03:49:24,050 --> 03:49:24,883
I don't mind that.

8255
03:49:25,040 --> 03:49:25,251
Hey,

8256
03:49:25,251 --> 03:49:26,240
what do you love bears.

8257
03:49:26,570 --> 03:49:30,110
I love bear and the cartoons
and I got her home washed.

8258
03:49:30,540 --> 03:49:31,373
Brainwashed as,

8259
03:49:31,720 --> 03:49:35,270
but I don't want to be
attacked by no goddamn bear.

8260
03:49:35,540 --> 03:49:38,540
So if that fear was eliminated,

8261
03:49:38,541 --> 03:49:41,720
1000% maybe more fucking
Mexicans would go in the woods.

8262
03:49:42,920 --> 03:49:45,770
A strong Mexican would
presence is not there.

8263
03:49:46,630 --> 03:49:48,680
I thought that's why
we stay in the cities.

8264
03:49:48,980 --> 03:49:50,990
Well bears are fucking legitimately scary.

8265
03:49:51,020 --> 03:49:53,840
I'm sure you saw that video that was going
around just a couple of days ago of a

8266
03:49:53,841 --> 03:49:54,450
guy who's a,

8267
03:49:54,450 --> 03:49:56,690
he's a knifemaker Montana.

8268
03:49:56,691 --> 03:50:00,400
He was up in the woods and he got attacked
by a mama bear and he got attacked

8269
03:50:00,410 --> 03:50:00,950
twice.

8270
03:50:00,950 --> 03:50:01,770
He got away White,

8271
03:50:01,770 --> 03:50:02,900
sprayed with the bear spray.

8272
03:50:02,901 --> 03:50:03,860
She's still got ahold of him.

8273
03:50:03,861 --> 03:50:06,560
He got away and then he
got away a second time.

8274
03:50:06,620 --> 03:50:08,500
Is that the need to get away from it?

8275
03:50:08,910 --> 03:50:12,950
Does that beer spray legit cause I
was making fun of the guy in like no,

8276
03:50:12,951 --> 03:50:14,170
the beer space kind of legit.

8277
03:50:15,690 --> 03:50:17,330
I would believe it better
than the cartilage it,

8278
03:50:17,331 --> 03:50:18,620
but it doesn't work always.

8279
03:50:18,621 --> 03:50:19,700
It didn't work in this case.

8280
03:50:20,850 --> 03:50:21,740
That's this guy.

8281
03:50:22,190 --> 03:50:22,491
No,

8282
03:50:22,491 --> 03:50:22,641
no.

8283
03:50:22,641 --> 03:50:24,020
This is like last week Eddie,

8284
03:50:24,860 --> 03:50:27,410
this guy sees right here is his scalp.

8285
03:50:27,670 --> 03:50:28,720
It's shredded.

8286
03:50:28,750 --> 03:50:31,160
You see as down to the bone right there.

8287
03:50:31,161 --> 03:50:31,441
It's like,

8288
03:50:31,441 --> 03:50:33,560
it's got a giant flap up here.

8289
03:50:34,320 --> 03:50:35,510
Call now.

8290
03:50:35,570 --> 03:50:36,350
He's a hunter.

8291
03:50:36,350 --> 03:50:37,690
He was scouting for outlook.

8292
03:50:37,930 --> 03:50:39,650
Oh it is arm.

8293
03:50:39,651 --> 03:50:40,340
Look at that.

8294
03:50:40,340 --> 03:50:41,740
Like how often does that,

8295
03:50:42,450 --> 03:50:43,283
once a year.

8296
03:50:43,850 --> 03:50:44,050
Yeah,

8297
03:50:44,050 --> 03:50:45,890
probably once a year
or something like that.

8298
03:50:45,950 --> 03:50:47,110
I would say that's a good note.

8299
03:50:47,350 --> 03:50:49,820
Do you hear about that
boy scout leader where uh,

8300
03:50:50,020 --> 03:50:52,830
you know in boy scouts they tell you
if you run into a bear that you'll

8301
03:50:52,890 --> 03:50:53,660
Yellowstone.

8302
03:50:53,660 --> 03:50:54,200
He goes,

8303
03:50:54,200 --> 03:50:55,033
if there's a beer,

8304
03:50:55,070 --> 03:51:00,070
everyone lays down and they'd stumble
upon a fucking black bear and he lays down

8305
03:51:00,561 --> 03:51:02,330
and all the other troops
are watching the beers.

8306
03:51:02,331 --> 03:51:02,840
Like,

8307
03:51:02,840 --> 03:51:06,590
look at this fucking idiot and just
ate them in front of the troops.

8308
03:51:06,950 --> 03:51:07,940
Oh my God.

8309
03:51:08,030 --> 03:51:09,830
Was that on Youtube?

8310
03:51:09,920 --> 03:51:11,240
It's on all over it.

8311
03:51:12,690 --> 03:51:13,523
To me,

8312
03:51:14,150 --> 03:51:15,410
there's a real difference.

8313
03:51:15,680 --> 03:51:18,740
There's a real difference between the
behavior of black bears and brown bears.

8314
03:51:18,741 --> 03:51:23,741
And what's really weird is it more black
bears attack people as predators versus

8315
03:51:25,260 --> 03:51:26,340
more brown

8316
03:51:26,340 --> 03:51:30,000
bears attack people out of
shock like a brown bear.

8317
03:51:30,001 --> 03:51:32,340
Like what happened with this guy
is what happens all the time?

8318
03:51:32,580 --> 03:51:37,580
You fuck up and you get near a mama with
her cubs and she just rips you apart.

8319
03:51:38,430 --> 03:51:42,390
That's what happens to most of
these guys when they play dead.

8320
03:51:42,600 --> 03:51:45,520
There's a different reaction
when a black bear gets you.

8321
03:51:45,521 --> 03:51:47,400
If a black bear gets
you and you played dead,

8322
03:51:47,790 --> 03:51:51,480
he might think you're dead and
just started eating pass first.

8323
03:51:52,080 --> 03:51:52,913
The general,

8324
03:51:53,610 --> 03:51:54,030
well,

8325
03:51:54,030 --> 03:51:55,080
the first was coyotes.

8326
03:51:55,081 --> 03:51:56,310
I think beer too.

8327
03:51:56,430 --> 03:51:57,263
What you want to do,

8328
03:51:58,030 --> 03:52:00,210
the thought has been wipers are the worst.

8329
03:52:00,211 --> 03:52:01,044
The polar bear,

8330
03:52:01,350 --> 03:52:02,310
they're the worst.

8331
03:52:02,340 --> 03:52:03,190
That's racist.

8332
03:52:05,260 --> 03:52:06,730
Polar bears are the worst.

8333
03:52:06,750 --> 03:52:07,321
The worst there.

8334
03:52:07,321 --> 03:52:08,041
Why not here?

8335
03:52:08,041 --> 03:52:13,041
The thing is clear that there's with
polar bears is their hair is clear up.

8336
03:52:13,621 --> 03:52:14,454
Her skin is,

8337
03:52:14,490 --> 03:52:15,160
here's the thing,

8338
03:52:15,160 --> 03:52:16,140
why did he say,

8339
03:52:16,170 --> 03:52:17,460
how can you say their hair is clear?

8340
03:52:17,461 --> 03:52:18,840
I'm going back on one of the year.

8341
03:52:18,960 --> 03:52:22,520
How can we say the Harris clear
when it's actually white as fuck,

8342
03:52:22,800 --> 03:52:23,580
but it's clear.

8343
03:52:23,580 --> 03:52:24,450
They say it's clear.

8344
03:52:27,600 --> 03:52:28,411
You're not knowing region.

8345
03:52:28,411 --> 03:52:29,244
Your white.

8346
03:52:29,340 --> 03:52:30,110
Okay.

8347
03:52:30,110 --> 03:52:31,430
[inaudible] don't they say that they,

8348
03:52:31,470 --> 03:52:33,690
I think they described
their hair is being clear.

8349
03:52:33,760 --> 03:52:35,040
That's exactly what they say.

8350
03:52:35,041 --> 03:52:35,940
I exclaimed white.

8351
03:52:35,941 --> 03:52:37,380
It's actually transparency.

8352
03:52:37,381 --> 03:52:41,250
It holds no color and appears to be
white because it reflects visual light.

8353
03:52:41,490 --> 03:52:42,323
I've seen,

8354
03:52:42,780 --> 03:52:44,040
I've seen polar bears guide.

8355
03:52:44,041 --> 03:52:47,670
That was why was saying
that's why I'm confused,

8356
03:52:47,671 --> 03:52:49,200
but also polar bears at the zoo.

8357
03:52:49,201 --> 03:52:50,730
It's not going off white snow.

8358
03:52:50,731 --> 03:52:51,564
It's going off.

8359
03:52:51,910 --> 03:52:52,743
There's still,

8360
03:52:52,820 --> 03:52:53,190
yeah,

8361
03:52:53,190 --> 03:52:54,023
there's still a white,

8362
03:52:54,040 --> 03:52:56,940
the first actually transparent
and holds no color.

8363
03:52:57,030 --> 03:52:57,781
It only appears.

8364
03:52:57,781 --> 03:52:57,961
Why?

8365
03:52:57,961 --> 03:52:59,250
Because it reflects visible.

8366
03:52:59,520 --> 03:53:00,840
Then it would look like a jellyfish.

8367
03:53:01,520 --> 03:53:03,120
The ocean come on the case.

8368
03:53:03,121 --> 03:53:05,040
That a technicality though because

8369
03:53:06,750 --> 03:53:10,290
it doesn't all color reflect
visible light in some way.

8370
03:53:10,320 --> 03:53:11,153
Right,

8371
03:53:11,970 --> 03:53:12,271
Jamie?

8372
03:53:12,271 --> 03:53:12,601
That's right.

8373
03:53:12,601 --> 03:53:13,670
You're right.

8374
03:53:15,990 --> 03:53:16,651
Can we it on her up?

8375
03:53:16,651 --> 03:53:17,484
I'm pretty sure like,

8376
03:53:17,650 --> 03:53:18,483
uh,

8377
03:53:18,510 --> 03:53:21,090
I think like black reflects
or absorbs all light.

8378
03:53:21,091 --> 03:53:21,924
It's one of those,

8379
03:53:23,500 --> 03:53:24,333
right?

8380
03:53:27,530 --> 03:53:28,850
Once it jumps in the water,

8381
03:53:28,851 --> 03:53:30,170
why is it still white dude?

8382
03:53:30,240 --> 03:53:34,400
Lights change color based on
how much or rather colors,

8383
03:53:34,580 --> 03:53:38,120
whether change their Hughes
based on how much light is there.

8384
03:53:40,440 --> 03:53:41,870
But they look to us

8385
03:53:41,980 --> 03:53:43,200
a color is a,

8386
03:53:43,320 --> 03:53:45,580
a frequency on the spectrum of light.

8387
03:53:46,290 --> 03:53:47,230
So your Sam,

8388
03:53:47,290 --> 03:53:48,190
that frequency,

8389
03:53:48,300 --> 03:53:49,133
right?

8390
03:53:49,600 --> 03:53:50,530
It's all there.

8391
03:53:50,560 --> 03:53:54,270
It's like technically our eyes
are only seeing a certain uh,

8392
03:53:56,410 --> 03:53:58,090
gauge or level of that frequency.

8393
03:53:58,091 --> 03:53:59,590
Like hearing is the same thing.

8394
03:53:59,591 --> 03:54:00,850
It's also on a frequency.

8395
03:54:01,060 --> 03:54:01,391
All,

8396
03:54:01,391 --> 03:54:02,800
all audio is draft frequency.

8397
03:54:02,801 --> 03:54:05,050
You can only hear 20
hertz to 20,000 Hertz.

8398
03:54:05,410 --> 03:54:06,670
Light is very similar.

8399
03:54:06,671 --> 03:54:07,810
It's not the same kind of hurts,

8400
03:54:07,811 --> 03:54:08,830
the same kind of waves,

8401
03:54:09,250 --> 03:54:10,720
but in a very similar way.

8402
03:54:10,721 --> 03:54:14,200
Like once you get to infrared as a
way higher frequency than what we can

8403
03:54:14,201 --> 03:54:14,711
actually see.

8404
03:54:14,711 --> 03:54:17,560
And that's sort of what it's getting into
saying here through reflecting light,

8405
03:54:17,561 --> 03:54:18,041
they only,

8406
03:54:18,041 --> 03:54:20,380
we can see a very fucked up version of it.

8407
03:54:21,100 --> 03:54:22,230
Sorry Jamie,

8408
03:54:23,980 --> 03:54:24,750
I'm proud of you.

8409
03:54:24,750 --> 03:54:27,790
[inaudible] nickname is Jamie Phd.

8410
03:54:28,360 --> 03:54:28,840
That's it.

8411
03:54:28,840 --> 03:54:29,700
That's young Jamie,

8412
03:54:29,850 --> 03:54:32,650
Jamie smart school down
some phd type Shit.

8413
03:54:32,740 --> 03:54:33,573
So all that,

8414
03:54:33,630 --> 03:54:34,570
he certainly did.

8415
03:54:35,070 --> 03:54:35,380
Um,

8416
03:54:35,380 --> 03:54:36,840
so all this stuff about their,

8417
03:54:36,850 --> 03:54:37,870
their white skin,

8418
03:54:37,871 --> 03:54:38,531
I'm not sure.

8419
03:54:38,531 --> 03:54:40,600
I understand that Mexico,

8420
03:54:41,680 --> 03:54:43,600
they have black skin
right underneath all that.

8421
03:54:43,630 --> 03:54:45,520
I think they're really dark and hoses.

8422
03:54:45,580 --> 03:54:45,971
Yeah,

8423
03:54:45,971 --> 03:54:46,804
I think they're actually,

8424
03:54:47,080 --> 03:54:49,690
they have a dark body
underneath all that stuff.

8425
03:54:51,880 --> 03:54:53,260
It's a weird animal man.

8426
03:54:53,350 --> 03:54:54,380
They just up their jacking.

8427
03:54:54,381 --> 03:54:54,700
Shit.

8428
03:54:54,700 --> 03:54:56,650
They don't have a single
piece of vegetable.

8429
03:54:56,990 --> 03:54:58,540
So you can't really kill plants.

8430
03:54:58,950 --> 03:54:59,190
Right?

8431
03:54:59,190 --> 03:55:00,160
Cause there's not a ton of them.

8432
03:55:00,590 --> 03:55:02,110
Now you're not polar bear hunt.

8433
03:55:02,111 --> 03:55:02,470
Hey,

8434
03:55:02,470 --> 03:55:03,730
I have a polar bear.

8435
03:55:03,731 --> 03:55:06,790
Had to fight a grizzly bear and I'm sure
they'd been on borders where like every

8436
03:55:06,791 --> 03:55:07,930
now and then like bitch,

8437
03:55:08,260 --> 03:55:10,420
the snow is mine and was like,

8438
03:55:10,421 --> 03:55:10,721
bitch,

8439
03:55:10,721 --> 03:55:11,920
this the mountains are mine.

8440
03:55:11,980 --> 03:55:12,700
Look at this shit.

8441
03:55:12,700 --> 03:55:15,940
Has there ever been a polar
bear versus grizzly bear match?

8442
03:55:15,970 --> 03:55:20,530
Polar bears is so well insulated by inches
of blubber and for that they're heat

8443
03:55:20,531 --> 03:55:25,531
signature is nearly invisible through
infrared photography to him young Jamie's

8444
03:55:25,600 --> 03:55:26,530
on the ball.

8445
03:55:26,920 --> 03:55:27,753
Damn the guy.

8446
03:55:28,070 --> 03:55:28,910
That's crazy.

8447
03:55:28,930 --> 03:55:30,150
Make fucking sounds did.

8448
03:55:30,160 --> 03:55:30,431
He's like,

8449
03:55:30,431 --> 03:55:35,230
Kanye West is going to make a
sound studio off bare blubber dude.

8450
03:55:35,231 --> 03:55:36,160
You could barely see them.

8451
03:55:36,630 --> 03:55:37,000
Right?

8452
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:38,620
I think this is what
you'd be getting into.

8453
03:55:39,280 --> 03:55:39,910
It's all good.

8454
03:55:39,910 --> 03:55:40,361
He knew.

8455
03:55:40,361 --> 03:55:43,000
I told him you mad.

8456
03:55:43,050 --> 03:55:44,200
So it's like,

8457
03:55:44,560 --> 03:55:45,730
it's like a lot of things in life.

8458
03:55:45,731 --> 03:55:46,690
You have to experience it.

8459
03:55:46,800 --> 03:55:47,390
Yeah.

8460
03:55:47,390 --> 03:55:48,280
Once you experience it,

8461
03:55:48,790 --> 03:55:49,870
you know an actual fight.

8462
03:55:49,871 --> 03:55:50,704
Companion.

8463
03:55:50,850 --> 03:55:51,310
Exactly.

8464
03:55:51,310 --> 03:55:52,143
These things go.

8465
03:55:52,860 --> 03:55:53,381
They go,

8466
03:55:53,381 --> 03:55:54,520
they go down the tracks,

8467
03:55:54,521 --> 03:55:56,200
they take turns and goes into the woods.

8468
03:55:56,410 --> 03:55:57,161
We've got to cover up.

8469
03:55:57,161 --> 03:55:58,210
You're knocking over trees.

8470
03:55:58,240 --> 03:55:59,073
They get the,

8471
03:56:00,750 --> 03:56:02,140
it was always fine man.

8472
03:56:02,170 --> 03:56:02,531
Listen,

8473
03:56:02,531 --> 03:56:03,180
these are awesome.

8474
03:56:03,180 --> 03:56:03,791
It's harder.

8475
03:56:03,791 --> 03:56:04,780
What's beautiful about these?

8476
03:56:04,781 --> 03:56:06,940
There's nothing to be sorry
for everybody's used to it.

8477
03:56:06,970 --> 03:56:07,803
Listen,

8478
03:56:09,220 --> 03:56:09,791
it's just what?

8479
03:56:09,791 --> 03:56:11,110
What's fun about these things?

8480
03:56:11,111 --> 03:56:11,970
Is there chaos?

8481
03:56:12,000 --> 03:56:15,460
I was excited to be involved
and I learned one thing.

8482
03:56:15,520 --> 03:56:16,810
I can't show favoritism.

8483
03:56:17,280 --> 03:56:18,060
It's a core.

8484
03:56:18,060 --> 03:56:19,270
You can is important.

8485
03:56:19,520 --> 03:56:20,021
You gotta look,

8486
03:56:20,021 --> 03:56:21,090
you gotta be open minded.

8487
03:56:21,970 --> 03:56:26,590
I didn't want veto power or Dan can
do whatever you want to talk shit.

8488
03:56:26,591 --> 03:56:30,700
And I'm talking about it through
my perspective as a commentator.

8489
03:56:30,701 --> 03:56:31,534
He can't show.

8490
03:56:31,560 --> 03:56:34,150
The problem is you've got
to keep the dialogue going.

8491
03:56:34,151 --> 03:56:35,410
So if there's really nothing,

8492
03:56:36,010 --> 03:56:39,250
the last resort is I'm going to talk show
and you just fucking sad cause I ain't

8493
03:56:39,251 --> 03:56:40,084
got none now.

8494
03:56:40,270 --> 03:56:40,720
Yeah.

8495
03:56:40,720 --> 03:56:41,760
So you got to keep the goals.

8496
03:56:41,790 --> 03:56:42,790
That's what happens a lot.

8497
03:56:42,791 --> 03:56:43,570
You're like fuck,

8498
03:56:43,570 --> 03:56:44,381
I'm sorry bro.

8499
03:56:44,381 --> 03:56:45,041
It's for the show.

8500
03:56:45,041 --> 03:56:46,980
With a sacrifice for the team.

8501
03:56:46,990 --> 03:56:48,290
We're going to sacrifice you.

8502
03:56:48,790 --> 03:56:49,001
Yeah.

8503
03:56:49,001 --> 03:56:50,260
Like as a commentator man,

8504
03:56:50,261 --> 03:56:53,190
it's really hard to not have
favoritism like every morning.

8505
03:56:53,230 --> 03:56:54,430
Twice as much.

8506
03:56:54,490 --> 03:56:55,600
You talked too much.

8507
03:56:55,601 --> 03:56:56,434
Shut out.

8508
03:56:56,640 --> 03:56:59,380
You talked too much bitch.

8509
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:00,630
No,

8510
03:57:00,630 --> 03:57:02,050
we supposed to do shut the fuck up.

8511
03:57:02,570 --> 03:57:06,430
Get out and said what if it was
normal that there was six seconds,

8512
03:57:06,580 --> 03:57:11,460
nine seconds of dead air pockets
everywhere on the show that was normal.

8513
03:57:11,461 --> 03:57:14,770
And this show in any show
like that was normal podcast.

8514
03:57:15,430 --> 03:57:16,450
If anything,

8515
03:57:16,570 --> 03:57:17,350
anything.

8516
03:57:17,350 --> 03:57:18,270
You got to keep it going.

8517
03:57:18,310 --> 03:57:19,120
You got to keep going on.

8518
03:57:19,120 --> 03:57:20,020
And if you're the host,

8519
03:57:20,110 --> 03:57:21,950
you're name is on some shit.

8520
03:57:21,980 --> 03:57:24,350
Sometimes there's dead air people off.

8521
03:57:24,370 --> 03:57:24,620
Yeah,

8522
03:57:24,620 --> 03:57:26,990
you're going to cut cause
you got to keep it going.

8523
03:57:26,991 --> 03:57:27,681
Like bitch,

8524
03:57:27,681 --> 03:57:28,411
we'll go back to you.

8525
03:57:28,411 --> 03:57:28,611
Shit,

8526
03:57:28,611 --> 03:57:29,540
we got four hours,

8527
03:57:29,750 --> 03:57:30,650
we'll get back to your shit.

8528
03:57:30,651 --> 03:57:32,150
But now that I've got this shit,

8529
03:57:32,151 --> 03:57:35,030
let me finish this and then we kill 20
minutes and then we'll get back to your

8530
03:57:35,031 --> 03:57:35,370
shit.

8531
03:57:35,370 --> 03:57:36,130
I think so.

8532
03:57:36,130 --> 03:57:36,801
Some fights.

8533
03:57:36,801 --> 03:57:38,070
It's important to give Debbie.

8534
03:57:38,071 --> 03:57:38,430
Yeah,

8535
03:57:38,430 --> 03:57:39,920
you've got to figure out
when to do it though.

8536
03:57:39,921 --> 03:57:40,820
And I'm not always right.

8537
03:57:40,821 --> 03:57:41,780
I fuck it up a lot.

8538
03:57:42,320 --> 03:57:44,530
It's just cause it's
your Ad Libbing like pee.

8539
03:57:44,531 --> 03:57:48,200
If people complain about like
commentaries on one way or another way.

8540
03:57:48,201 --> 03:57:51,740
I'm just trying to do my best and
sometimes it's a slippery thing.

8541
03:57:51,741 --> 03:57:54,200
Like when people are fighting
and crazy shit's going on.

8542
03:57:54,201 --> 03:57:54,720
Passion,

8543
03:57:54,720 --> 03:57:55,130
passionate.

8544
03:57:55,130 --> 03:57:57,950
And also you might not recognize
everything that's happening.

8545
03:57:57,951 --> 03:57:58,784
Things happen.

8546
03:57:59,000 --> 03:58:00,680
You're looking for patterns and striking,

8547
03:58:00,681 --> 03:58:01,940
but you're also looking for,

8548
03:58:01,941 --> 03:58:05,780
you know like someone slowing down
is a lot of shit you're looking for.

8549
03:58:06,010 --> 03:58:06,290
You know?

8550
03:58:06,290 --> 03:58:07,040
It's a weird,

8551
03:58:07,040 --> 03:58:07,873
it's a weird gig.

8552
03:58:08,180 --> 03:58:08,880
The crazy thing,

8553
03:58:08,880 --> 03:58:09,470
that's hard.

8554
03:58:09,470 --> 03:58:11,720
We talked about this years,

8555
03:58:11,900 --> 03:58:14,720
years ago when you first started
commentating for the UFC,

8556
03:58:14,721 --> 03:58:16,850
like as a fantasy.

8557
03:58:17,090 --> 03:58:22,090
Wouldn't it be cool if somehow the owner
of the UFC wanted you to be yourself

8558
03:58:25,430 --> 03:58:28,100
and wanted you to say whatever
the fuck you want her to say?

8559
03:58:28,130 --> 03:58:28,963
Just like this.

8560
03:58:29,060 --> 03:58:31,220
It was a fantasy and now what's happening?

8561
03:58:31,310 --> 03:58:32,510
You can say whatever you want.

8562
03:58:32,511 --> 03:58:33,970
We're going to have to talk about it.

8563
03:58:35,100 --> 03:58:35,840
They'll show you.

8564
03:58:35,840 --> 03:58:36,561
It's a beautiful thing.

8565
03:58:36,561 --> 03:58:38,210
It's what's happening right now.

8566
03:58:38,690 --> 03:58:39,320
Shit,

8567
03:58:39,320 --> 03:58:40,310
no rules.

8568
03:58:40,630 --> 03:58:44,930
True can even bring into journals
or dominoes fucking style,

8569
03:58:45,440 --> 03:58:45,890
you know?

8570
03:58:45,890 --> 03:58:46,880
And here's another thing,

8571
03:58:47,150 --> 03:58:51,350
friends who don't always agree on
shit but still love each other,

8572
03:58:51,410 --> 03:58:53,150
have a great time hanging
out and talking shit,

8573
03:58:53,151 --> 03:58:53,900
this motherfucker,

8574
03:58:53,900 --> 03:58:55,670
because he sounds do we hate each other.

8575
03:58:56,030 --> 03:58:56,863
We hate each other,

8576
03:58:58,190 --> 03:59:00,050
but you're trying to
steal him away from me.

8577
03:59:00,850 --> 03:59:01,740
And I'm like,

8578
03:59:01,741 --> 03:59:02,240
guys go.

8579
03:59:02,240 --> 03:59:03,073
If that happened,

8580
03:59:03,140 --> 03:59:03,973
another

8581
03:59:06,350 --> 03:59:07,183
fucking men.

8582
03:59:07,190 --> 03:59:08,023
But you know what I mean?

8583
03:59:08,070 --> 03:59:09,830
My point is if there's an illusion,

8584
03:59:10,040 --> 03:59:13,190
it's an illusion that a lot of people
suffer under and that illusion is that

8585
03:59:13,191 --> 03:59:15,860
someone has to think exactly like
you for you to be their friend.

8586
03:59:15,890 --> 03:59:16,280
Oh No,

8587
03:59:16,280 --> 03:59:19,040
I take that shit is so stupid because
there's a lot of people that have some

8588
03:59:19,041 --> 03:59:21,020
crazy ideas and I love him to death.

8589
03:59:21,021 --> 03:59:22,460
I give him a hug every time I see him.

8590
03:59:22,730 --> 03:59:24,170
And I only talked to
him about certain shit.

8591
03:59:24,580 --> 03:59:26,850
Who wants to hang out with
somebody exactly like that.

8592
03:59:26,870 --> 03:59:26,940
Yeah,

8593
03:59:26,940 --> 03:59:28,070
that'd be a lot of people do.

8594
03:59:28,071 --> 03:59:28,700
Man.

8595
03:59:28,700 --> 03:59:31,040
A lot of people are scared
of being themselves,

8596
03:59:31,240 --> 03:59:31,850
you know,

8597
03:59:31,850 --> 03:59:32,170
and,

8598
03:59:32,170 --> 03:59:33,350
and so because of that,

8599
03:59:33,351 --> 03:59:37,100
they want to find like some comfortable
frequency where it's like an accent that

8600
03:59:37,101 --> 03:59:38,390
everyone in the neighborhood has.

8601
03:59:38,391 --> 03:59:38,690
Yeah.

8602
03:59:38,690 --> 03:59:42,350
It's a way of thinking and behaving that
reinforces the idea that you're on the

8603
03:59:42,351 --> 03:59:43,670
same team as everybody else.

8604
03:59:44,060 --> 03:59:45,530
It's a natural instinct that we have.

8605
03:59:45,531 --> 03:59:46,700
It's a tribal instinct.

8606
03:59:46,720 --> 03:59:46,940
No,

8607
03:59:46,940 --> 03:59:47,990
I give any ship.

8608
03:59:48,260 --> 03:59:52,130
There's a couple of things he sent me
links to and we've had long talks with

8609
03:59:52,340 --> 03:59:53,240
legit stuff.

8610
03:59:53,241 --> 03:59:54,500
Especially when it comes to my kids.

8611
03:59:54,501 --> 03:59:55,850
There's a fucking spectrum.

8612
03:59:55,880 --> 03:59:56,780
There's a spectrum.

8613
03:59:56,781 --> 04:00:00,590
People think it's a beautiful thing
that people think all this drama that's

8614
04:00:00,591 --> 04:00:01,011
going on.

8615
04:00:01,011 --> 04:00:04,790
But me and Brendan were not like tight
and going out and having fucking lunch

8616
04:00:04,791 --> 04:00:05,181
all the time.

8617
04:00:05,181 --> 04:00:06,140
But let me tell you,

8618
04:00:06,350 --> 04:00:10,880
I rarely go out to lunch
with any friends or anything.

8619
04:00:10,881 --> 04:00:11,990
I don't hang out with anybody.

8620
04:00:11,991 --> 04:00:14,090
I have no time between all my schools.

8621
04:00:14,240 --> 04:00:17,720
It's just all my free time
is my wife and my son.

8622
04:00:18,170 --> 04:00:20,280
Everything else is my wife

8623
04:00:20,280 --> 04:00:20,791
and my son.

8624
04:00:20,791 --> 04:00:21,240
Busy.

8625
04:00:21,240 --> 04:00:22,320
I don't hang out with anybody.

8626
04:00:22,321 --> 04:00:23,160
So I mean,

8627
04:00:23,161 --> 04:00:23,760
Brendan,

8628
04:00:23,760 --> 04:00:25,120
I fucking love bladder.

8629
04:00:25,140 --> 04:00:28,710
How many times I said to
you personally off camera.

8630
04:00:28,860 --> 04:00:30,270
I said that motherfucker.

8631
04:00:30,330 --> 04:00:31,081
You too.

8632
04:00:31,081 --> 04:00:32,450
When you guys go off on Emma,

8633
04:00:32,720 --> 04:00:34,410
I've told them at least three times.

8634
04:00:34,740 --> 04:00:38,580
You guys have amazing chemistry
because you guys remember fights.

8635
04:00:38,581 --> 04:00:39,510
I don't remember shit.

8636
04:00:39,660 --> 04:00:42,420
So when you started talking about
this guy knocked out this guy,

8637
04:00:42,630 --> 04:00:46,830
if three years ago I just shut the fuck
up because my brain don't work like that

8638
04:00:46,831 --> 04:00:47,460
no more.

8639
04:00:47,460 --> 04:00:49,080
I watched too many conspiracy theories.

8640
04:00:49,081 --> 04:00:49,950
You guys are watching fight.

8641
04:00:50,230 --> 04:00:55,230
I want to an oil deception man.

8642
04:00:56,170 --> 04:00:58,000
When I talked to shop when I took to you,

8643
04:00:58,001 --> 04:01:02,410
it elevates my thinking about like past
fights because I know you know so much

8644
04:01:02,411 --> 04:01:04,810
about past fights so I
know I'm talking to a dude.

8645
04:01:04,811 --> 04:01:08,850
He's like on the same level as far as
like your history of like pride fights and

8646
04:01:08,851 --> 04:01:09,570
who not really.

8647
04:01:09,570 --> 04:01:11,130
You're to close fucking battling.

8648
04:01:11,131 --> 04:01:11,964
Fucking close.

8649
04:01:12,100 --> 04:01:12,551
Pretty close.

8650
04:01:12,551 --> 04:01:13,540
But it's inspiring.

8651
04:01:13,541 --> 04:01:16,760
Like you know so much about it
that I have to like remember shit.

8652
04:01:16,820 --> 04:01:18,040
What is your system?

8653
04:01:18,410 --> 04:01:20,030
How do you stay so sharp?

8654
04:01:20,090 --> 04:01:20,391
Because you,

8655
04:01:20,391 --> 04:01:22,100
I know you stay sharp and you got your,

8656
04:01:22,101 --> 04:01:25,910
you got work ethic when it comes to being
on top of the UFC and what's going on.

8657
04:01:26,090 --> 04:01:27,470
And I know you got work ethic.

8658
04:01:27,560 --> 04:01:32,560
I know you said before you go to bed you
have to watch some fights right before

8659
04:01:32,661 --> 04:01:33,494
you go to bed.

8660
04:01:34,040 --> 04:01:35,940
It's just cause you guys like it.

8661
04:01:36,020 --> 04:01:37,460
So I stay up on that.

8662
04:01:38,120 --> 04:01:39,470
When do you watch the fights?

8663
04:01:40,760 --> 04:01:42,890
When they're live and I'll
record them and if it's,

8664
04:01:42,950 --> 04:01:45,710
if it's like a big one or if we're doing
a fight competitor or doing something,

8665
04:01:45,711 --> 04:01:46,544
I'll watch it again.

8666
04:01:46,590 --> 04:01:47,720
You don't have to do it a lot,

8667
04:01:47,721 --> 04:01:47,901
man.

8668
04:01:47,901 --> 04:01:49,520
I've been watching a lot of more time,

8669
04:01:49,521 --> 04:01:50,090
man.

8670
04:01:50,090 --> 04:01:51,010
A lot of Moyie Thai food

8671
04:01:51,770 --> 04:01:53,850
boxing obsessed with boxing,

8672
04:01:54,060 --> 04:01:54,893
but you know me,

8673
04:01:54,950 --> 04:01:58,070
I barely can keep up with them in Maine
you have said so I don't have time for

8674
04:01:58,071 --> 04:01:59,210
kickboxing and boxing,

8675
04:01:59,211 --> 04:02:00,500
but in big bear,

8676
04:02:01,160 --> 04:02:03,770
triple g I got a taste
of that motherfucker.

8677
04:02:03,890 --> 04:02:04,723
I like Kim.

8678
04:02:04,740 --> 04:02:05,600
All of a sudden I got,

8679
04:02:06,570 --> 04:02:08,180
I got a little foot in the door in boxing,

8680
04:02:08,420 --> 04:02:09,530
but I also,

8681
04:02:09,620 --> 04:02:10,880
while I was up in big bear,

8682
04:02:10,881 --> 04:02:11,714
we're fucking just,

8683
04:02:11,930 --> 04:02:12,770
just chillin,

8684
04:02:12,920 --> 04:02:15,620
making sure our seizures
don't act up like all night.

8685
04:02:15,950 --> 04:02:18,800
And we put on the best of glory,

8686
04:02:19,190 --> 04:02:20,630
the best of glory.

8687
04:02:21,110 --> 04:02:22,940
Holy Shit.

8688
04:02:23,180 --> 04:02:26,300
Get on UFC fight pass and watch the,

8689
04:02:26,510 --> 04:02:27,230
they'll go through,

8690
04:02:27,230 --> 04:02:28,550
there's a documentary them,

8691
04:02:29,210 --> 04:02:29,960
man,

8692
04:02:29,960 --> 04:02:32,060
they hit fucking hard.

8693
04:02:32,270 --> 04:02:33,380
Holy Shit.

8694
04:02:33,820 --> 04:02:35,620
All of a sudden you
guys are watching that.

8695
04:02:36,920 --> 04:02:37,451
Listen man.

8696
04:02:37,451 --> 04:02:37,681
I'm like,

8697
04:02:37,681 --> 04:02:37,901
good.

8698
04:02:37,901 --> 04:02:39,280
I'm so glad you brought that up.

8699
04:02:39,281 --> 04:02:41,290
Cause I was actually gonna ask
you guys if you want to do this.

8700
04:02:41,320 --> 04:02:45,950
That's guys fight companion
for glory when there's glory,

8701
04:02:46,220 --> 04:02:46,691
glory,

8702
04:02:46,691 --> 04:02:47,410
Denver.

8703
04:02:47,410 --> 04:02:51,430
And it's on October
21st and it's in Denver.

8704
04:02:51,460 --> 04:02:52,121
Is that a Saturday?

8705
04:02:52,121 --> 04:02:52,980
And it's a niche.

8706
04:02:53,050 --> 04:02:57,340
I think I'm going to be Nikki Holtzclaw's
rematching Marketo grown hall.

8707
04:02:57,360 --> 04:02:58,120
Is that,

8708
04:02:58,120 --> 04:02:58,421
is that,

8709
04:02:58,421 --> 04:02:59,201
who was in October?

8710
04:02:59,201 --> 04:02:59,760
Why?

8711
04:02:59,760 --> 04:03:00,593
Oh,

8712
04:03:00,670 --> 04:03:01,503
I'll tell you again,

8713
04:03:01,870 --> 04:03:03,610
but I was thinking it'd be fun to do that.

8714
04:03:03,670 --> 04:03:04,503
Um,

8715
04:03:05,380 --> 04:03:10,380
the 21st of October 21st he's sober,

8716
04:03:10,571 --> 04:03:12,810
he's fighting growing heart
and he's a bad motherfucker.

8717
04:03:12,820 --> 04:03:15,520
They had a really close fight
the first time really close.

8718
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:16,570
Um,

8719
04:03:16,570 --> 04:03:17,380
Varga,

8720
04:03:17,380 --> 04:03:17,531
rue,

8721
04:03:17,531 --> 04:03:18,010
small and

8722
04:03:18,010 --> 04:03:18,521
very small.

8723
04:03:18,521 --> 04:03:23,270
And so this 24th of
October 21st 21st and uh,

8724
04:03:23,320 --> 04:03:25,830
but Nicky holds skin
is a bad mother fucker.

8725
04:03:25,850 --> 04:03:26,683
Dude.

8726
04:03:27,430 --> 04:03:30,730
21st of October I'm going
to be in Springfield.

8727
04:03:30,790 --> 04:03:31,390
Dammit.

8728
04:03:31,390 --> 04:03:32,590
Oregon grown on,

8729
04:03:32,591 --> 04:03:34,090
it's a bad motherfucker to planets.

8730
04:03:34,110 --> 04:03:35,200
Springfield in the house.

8731
04:03:35,260 --> 04:03:36,940
You know who we need to get in if he can,

8732
04:03:36,941 --> 04:03:39,010
we need to get Joe
Schilling in for that one,

8733
04:03:39,510 --> 04:03:39,751
right?

8734
04:03:39,751 --> 04:03:40,270
Yeah.

8735
04:03:40,270 --> 04:03:40,770
Yeah.

8736
04:03:40,770 --> 04:03:41,603
Right.

8737
04:03:41,760 --> 04:03:46,360
Because Joe was fighting to glory for
launch and they showed that fight that we

8738
04:03:46,361 --> 04:03:48,370
saw at the forum would be where they live,

8739
04:03:48,640 --> 04:03:52,180
where they went into overtime and they
did the extra rounds and fucking knocked

8740
04:03:52,181 --> 04:03:52,720
out back.

8741
04:03:52,720 --> 04:03:53,411
It was amazing.

8742
04:03:53,411 --> 04:03:54,340
Last man standing,

8743
04:03:54,430 --> 04:03:58,460
hey dude to do some more mountain
running on October 23rd listen,

8744
04:03:58,660 --> 04:04:00,160
listen in Springfield

8745
04:04:01,920 --> 04:04:03,820
had a disc replaced in his back,

8746
04:04:03,821 --> 04:04:05,110
like pretty significant back.

8747
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:10,140
Ivan's roll Jujitsu and over four months
now I just had major back surgery so I

8748
04:04:11,621 --> 04:04:15,720
think I might take off the rest of the
year just to be sure to safe smartly.

8749
04:04:15,760 --> 04:04:16,450
Sure.

8750
04:04:16,450 --> 04:04:17,920
Cause when the doctor tells me,

8751
04:04:18,340 --> 04:04:18,581
you know,

8752
04:04:18,581 --> 04:04:19,414
I was on,

8753
04:04:19,690 --> 04:04:20,110
you know,

8754
04:04:20,110 --> 04:04:22,090
you can either get fusion on your desk,

8755
04:04:22,120 --> 04:04:23,200
which is last resort.

8756
04:04:23,201 --> 04:04:25,420
We just got to fucking
screw everything together.

8757
04:04:26,020 --> 04:04:27,340
Or we could put a disk in,

8758
04:04:27,620 --> 04:04:27,911
right?

8759
04:04:27,911 --> 04:04:31,360
There's people that are qualified for the
desk and if you don't qualify for that

8760
04:04:31,361 --> 04:04:31,650
desk,

8761
04:04:31,650 --> 04:04:31,901
they're like,

8762
04:04:31,901 --> 04:04:32,291
you know what,

8763
04:04:32,291 --> 04:04:33,250
your shit so fucked up.

8764
04:04:33,280 --> 04:04:36,580
You got to fucking lock all
that shit up with screws.

8765
04:04:37,090 --> 04:04:38,230
So I was on the fence.

8766
04:04:38,410 --> 04:04:40,120
So the doctor would sit me down and say,

8767
04:04:41,270 --> 04:04:45,430
what does this Jujitsu people
picking you up and slamming you?

8768
04:04:45,700 --> 04:04:45,971
I'm like,

8769
04:04:45,971 --> 04:04:46,421
no,

8770
04:04:46,421 --> 04:04:47,254
I'm not gonna really get,

8771
04:04:47,830 --> 04:04:48,670
are you?

8772
04:04:48,910 --> 04:04:49,660
Are you,

8773
04:04:49,660 --> 04:04:50,560
are they picking you up?

8774
04:04:50,590 --> 04:04:51,700
Is there impact?

8775
04:04:52,270 --> 04:04:53,890
And the fact that it was
asking this question,

8776
04:04:53,891 --> 04:04:54,341
I was like no,

8777
04:04:54,341 --> 04:04:54,521
no,

8778
04:04:54,521 --> 04:04:54,671
no.

8779
04:04:54,671 --> 04:04:55,301
It's like dude,

8780
04:04:55,301 --> 04:04:56,710
I'm fucking pillow quarter guard.

8781
04:04:57,490 --> 04:05:02,140
And just clinch on mother fuckers
aren't impact in my roles ever did.

8782
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:03,190
Do you have any back issues?

8783
04:05:03,191 --> 04:05:05,290
Came all that running and hiking shit.

8784
04:05:05,620 --> 04:05:07,480
Cause that's the only thing that
tightens me up is when I run,

8785
04:05:07,510 --> 04:05:08,261
I love running.

8786
04:05:08,261 --> 04:05:09,820
But that's what tightens my back.

8787
04:05:09,900 --> 04:05:10,600
Yeah,

8788
04:05:10,600 --> 04:05:11,433
you're pretty big.

8789
04:05:11,590 --> 04:05:14,290
You know that makes a difference
on running for the pounding.

8790
04:05:14,650 --> 04:05:15,760
So it's tougher on your body.

8791
04:05:15,790 --> 04:05:16,900
But with all the hunter and anything,

8792
04:05:16,901 --> 04:05:18,580
you haven't had any
injuries or knee problems?

8793
04:05:18,581 --> 04:05:19,120
Nothing.

8794
04:05:19,120 --> 04:05:19,953
But what's a,

8795
04:05:20,290 --> 04:05:23,200
what's a really big guy for
a hundred a hundred mile?

8796
04:05:23,690 --> 04:05:25,630
Anybody who's been the biggest guys?

8797
04:05:25,631 --> 04:05:27,850
I mean nobody's ever over

8798
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:31,880
one 80 so I can't do it.

8799
04:05:32,490 --> 04:05:33,323
You can't do it.

8800
04:05:33,520 --> 04:05:34,353
It's just to do it.

8801
04:05:34,880 --> 04:05:37,740
Talk about really what we're
talking with Stephan struve.

8802
04:05:37,741 --> 04:05:41,530
I was thinking there's only like a certain
amount of blood the that guy can get

8803
04:05:41,620 --> 04:05:42,430
to his body.

8804
04:05:42,430 --> 04:05:42,731
Right?

8805
04:05:42,731 --> 04:05:44,470
He's got so much body to deal with.

8806
04:05:44,850 --> 04:05:45,401
Like he's,

8807
04:05:45,401 --> 04:05:49,420
he's got his cardio can't be as good
as the mighty mouse is just so big.

8808
04:05:49,950 --> 04:05:52,930
There's just so much blood
has to keep pumping fuel from.

8809
04:05:54,470 --> 04:05:55,650
I run 40 year and laughed.

8810
04:05:55,660 --> 04:05:58,570
I run 14 miles a week for a bigger guy.

8811
04:05:58,580 --> 04:06:00,010
Loved his size.

8812
04:06:00,011 --> 04:06:04,900
Might not be like I have anything
to do with the UFC fight though.

8813
04:06:05,170 --> 04:06:07,630
Maybe if he was headed like
survive the apocalypse,

8814
04:06:07,890 --> 04:06:08,830
he would see the difference.

8815
04:06:08,831 --> 04:06:10,690
But I don't think you'd
see the difference.

8816
04:06:10,840 --> 04:06:14,200
Like could just cause he's seven foot
that he's going to have shitty cardio.

8817
04:06:14,380 --> 04:06:14,591
No,

8818
04:06:14,591 --> 04:06:15,560
I'm just saying that you're,

8819
04:06:15,561 --> 04:06:16,070
when you're to

8820
04:06:16,070 --> 04:06:19,430
65 I think there's a magic number and I
think there's a lot of guys agree with

8821
04:06:19,431 --> 04:06:21,380
this and it's around where
steeply Mijo chick is.

8822
04:06:21,650 --> 04:06:25,010
It's around where Cain
Velasquez is set to 40 number.

8823
04:06:25,220 --> 04:06:28,310
It seems like two forties as heavy as you
want to get cause you can handle a guy

8824
04:06:28,311 --> 04:06:31,940
that's two 65 because at
25 pound differential,

8825
04:06:32,120 --> 04:06:33,520
although it seems like a big deal,

8826
04:06:33,590 --> 04:06:36,260
like if if the skills better it,

8827
04:06:36,290 --> 04:06:39,380
it plays itself out because
it's 25 pound differential.

8828
04:06:39,381 --> 04:06:39,801
That guy,

8829
04:06:39,801 --> 04:06:43,060
that 265 pound guy or bigger
and cutting down to it,

8830
04:06:43,210 --> 04:06:48,210
it has such a giant reservoir
that he needs to fill also slower,

8831
04:06:48,680 --> 04:06:50,560
slower speed but cardio,

8832
04:06:50,710 --> 04:06:53,030
but if you're a two 40
and you got Brock Lesnar,

8833
04:06:53,180 --> 04:06:53,770
that's not good.

8834
04:06:53,770 --> 04:06:56,360
That's not true because that's
what Cain Velasquez did to him.

8835
04:06:56,510 --> 04:06:57,343
He worked him.

8836
04:06:57,740 --> 04:06:58,521
Brock took him down,

8837
04:06:58,521 --> 04:07:01,490
he got right back up and Brock
got tired and Cain did not.

8838
04:07:01,670 --> 04:07:04,850
And Kane started beating on him with
perfect striking because we've heard pop

8839
04:07:04,851 --> 04:07:05,061
pop,

8840
04:07:05,061 --> 04:07:06,590
pop and and Brock was like,

8841
04:07:06,620 --> 04:07:07,340
Oh shit,

8842
04:07:07,340 --> 04:07:08,960
I'm in deep fucking trouble.

8843
04:07:09,110 --> 04:07:10,940
And he took him down and beat him up.

8844
04:07:11,180 --> 04:07:16,100
It was a brutal fight and an excellent
example of how a 240 pound fighter,

8845
04:07:16,440 --> 04:07:17,420
it might be a better deal.

8846
04:07:17,421 --> 04:07:18,440
That's why I could do that.

8847
04:07:18,450 --> 04:07:18,821
Kingsville,

8848
04:07:18,821 --> 04:07:19,760
but that's a fighter.

8849
04:07:19,900 --> 04:07:20,620
That's,

8850
04:07:20,620 --> 04:07:24,330
I mean that could be a fighting
style man versus man til it's also,

8851
04:07:24,500 --> 04:07:25,520
you have to put it up,

8852
04:07:25,550 --> 04:07:26,480
you have to put it up at Cain.

8853
04:07:26,481 --> 04:07:29,430
Velasquez has extraordinary
cardio for heavyweight.

8854
04:07:29,720 --> 04:07:33,800
Cardio is one of the biggest weapons
he has and if not the absolutely,

8855
04:07:34,010 --> 04:07:35,060
absolutely skill.

8856
04:07:35,270 --> 04:07:37,850
Great technique with
striking and with wrestling,

8857
04:07:38,900 --> 04:07:42,110
but almost more importantly
championship mindset,

8858
04:07:42,350 --> 04:07:45,050
like a hundred percent
confidence in himself and cardio.

8859
04:07:45,051 --> 04:07:47,990
That's just like superhuman
is a championship mindset.

8860
04:07:48,020 --> 04:07:53,020
He has the heart like no one else and
then he has cardio is how fucking hard MMA

8861
04:07:53,721 --> 04:07:54,020
is.

8862
04:07:54,020 --> 04:07:55,430
Even that guy lost.

8863
04:07:55,460 --> 04:07:56,293
Yeah.

8864
04:07:56,330 --> 04:07:56,901
Isn't that crazy?

8865
04:07:56,901 --> 04:07:57,380
Come on,

8866
04:07:57,380 --> 04:07:58,213
man.

8867
04:07:58,460 --> 04:08:03,460
Even that guy can have a day where he
just like when he fought over doom.

8868
04:08:03,740 --> 04:08:04,573
That's right.

8869
04:08:05,660 --> 04:08:06,380
Yup.

8870
04:08:06,380 --> 04:08:09,170
That's what I found is
best guys have 10 losses.

8871
04:08:09,200 --> 04:08:09,530
Yup.

8872
04:08:09,530 --> 04:08:09,890
Yeah,

8873
04:08:09,890 --> 04:08:10,410
exactly.

8874
04:08:10,410 --> 04:08:11,243
Yeah.

8875
04:08:11,360 --> 04:08:11,920
Look man,

8876
04:08:11,920 --> 04:08:12,860
in my opinion,

8877
04:08:12,920 --> 04:08:17,240
I mean bef Kane is not done
like his career is not done,

8878
04:08:17,360 --> 04:08:18,530
but when it all goes down,

8879
04:08:18,680 --> 04:08:20,750
you have to look at him
in his prime and go that.

8880
04:08:20,840 --> 04:08:24,620
That is one of the very best examples of
a heavyweight fighter we've ever seen.

8881
04:08:25,230 --> 04:08:26,510
I think he's top two.

8882
04:08:26,511 --> 04:08:27,344
If Tom,

8883
04:08:28,040 --> 04:08:28,940
I'm 100% with you,

8884
04:08:28,941 --> 04:08:30,280
I think on a personal one,

8885
04:08:30,410 --> 04:08:31,980
but it might because a door see,

8886
04:08:32,010 --> 04:08:35,300
well you could toss for doom in there
without a good toss for doom in there,

8887
04:08:35,330 --> 04:08:36,620
but you could toss for
doom and they're just so,

8888
04:08:36,660 --> 04:08:38,540
it was true on accomplishments on paper.

8889
04:08:38,540 --> 04:08:39,560
You have to look at if you're doing,

8890
04:08:39,660 --> 04:08:40,280
I think,

8891
04:08:40,280 --> 04:08:43,880
I think Kane most likely the
obviously just my educated opinion,

8892
04:08:44,030 --> 04:08:49,030
I think he's the best matchup for four
to beat Steve Bay with skill sets because

8893
04:08:51,050 --> 04:08:53,240
does doom and then he gets steep a,

8894
04:08:53,241 --> 04:08:54,530
it's a tough matchup for steep.

8895
04:08:54,531 --> 04:08:55,430
If you look down on paper,

8896
04:08:55,460 --> 04:08:56,960
if they fight the way he fought,

8897
04:08:56,980 --> 04:08:57,170
if,

8898
04:08:57,170 --> 04:08:57,441
I mean,

8899
04:08:57,441 --> 04:08:58,100
here's the thing,

8900
04:08:58,100 --> 04:09:01,840
they cane has been through
some wars with junior wars.

8901
04:09:01,860 --> 04:09:03,770
Dbas been through war and steep,

8902
04:09:03,780 --> 04:09:05,060
it went through a war with junior.

8903
04:09:05,061 --> 04:09:07,040
But the difference between
his teeth pays war with Jr.

8904
04:09:07,041 --> 04:09:08,000
And I know MMA,

8905
04:09:08,001 --> 04:09:09,380
math doesn't really work this way.

8906
04:09:09,670 --> 04:09:12,530
Like you can't like look at one guy and
go just cause it's one guy beat one guy,

8907
04:09:12,531 --> 04:09:13,364
he's going to beat the other guy.

8908
04:09:13,570 --> 04:09:14,430
It doesn't work like that.

8909
04:09:14,580 --> 04:09:18,780
But if they fight in the same way that
Steve Bay fought junior dos Santos,

8910
04:09:18,781 --> 04:09:23,100
you've got to think that cane can keep
a pace that's ahead of where jds was

8911
04:09:23,130 --> 04:09:25,350
correct and take Steve Bay and him,

8912
04:09:25,440 --> 04:09:29,310
it was a very close fight between him
and jds and it was like super close him

8913
04:09:29,311 --> 04:09:32,640
hitting that high level upper echelon of
the heavyweight division for the first

8914
04:09:32,641 --> 04:09:33,181
time as well,

8915
04:09:33,181 --> 04:09:34,230
other than the strew fight.

8916
04:09:34,800 --> 04:09:35,400
So I think,

8917
04:09:35,400 --> 04:09:36,091
I don't know man.

8918
04:09:36,091 --> 04:09:36,924
I think that,

8919
04:09:37,050 --> 04:09:39,860
I think that Cain is a nightmare
for anybody if he's healthy.

8920
04:09:39,861 --> 04:09:43,410
I just think if cane comes back and
becomes champion and beat Steve Bay,

8921
04:09:43,470 --> 04:09:47,010
he's the best heavyweight of all time
and there's a good probability he's going

8922
04:09:47,011 --> 04:09:47,844
to do that.

8923
04:09:48,090 --> 04:09:48,923
We're steep,

8924
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:49,271
steep.

8925
04:09:49,271 --> 04:09:49,950
It's a nightmare.

8926
04:09:49,950 --> 04:09:50,220
But his,

8927
04:09:50,220 --> 04:09:51,990
that's box boxing but how,

8928
04:09:52,060 --> 04:09:53,490
how but what if he did MMA?

8929
04:09:53,640 --> 04:09:54,361
Oh boy.

8930
04:09:54,361 --> 04:09:56,180
He would get taken down smushed.

8931
04:09:56,770 --> 04:09:57,840
You'd get fucked up.

8932
04:09:58,080 --> 04:09:59,940
He get taken down and smashed through two.

8933
04:09:59,941 --> 04:10:00,960
Don't have know how to wrestle.

8934
04:10:00,961 --> 04:10:03,420
You can't start at 35 and
compete at that level.

8935
04:10:03,421 --> 04:10:03,721
You just,

8936
04:10:03,721 --> 04:10:04,140
you're not,

8937
04:10:04,140 --> 04:10:05,850
if you don't actually know something.

8938
04:10:06,300 --> 04:10:11,300
If a guy knows something and Anthony
Boxes Klitschko Andrew Johns,

8939
04:10:12,130 --> 04:10:13,740
Joshua [inaudible] not the tall,

8940
04:10:13,741 --> 04:10:17,100
those guys would would
get destroyed and if not,

8941
04:10:17,310 --> 04:10:21,240
they started in them and man fucked
up by a lot of high level right now.

8942
04:10:21,240 --> 04:10:22,170
They decided to do it.

8943
04:10:22,500 --> 04:10:24,380
Do they get fucked up by Rico Verhoeven?

8944
04:10:24,390 --> 04:10:24,690
This,

8945
04:10:24,690 --> 04:10:25,710
forget about MMA.

8946
04:10:25,890 --> 04:10:27,720
Just kickboxers a like Rico.

8947
04:10:27,721 --> 04:10:30,930
Verhoeven will fuck up a
lot of boxes and touch him.

8948
04:10:30,960 --> 04:10:33,540
He wouldn't give me
away way on the outside.

8949
04:10:34,310 --> 04:10:36,450
More prepared for MMA than boxers know.

8950
04:10:36,451 --> 04:10:38,520
What I'm saying is that boxers right now,

8951
04:10:38,550 --> 04:10:43,150
like them getting into MMA is they can't
even get through the top kickboxers is

8952
04:10:43,151 --> 04:10:43,591
what I'm saying.

8953
04:10:43,591 --> 04:10:47,690
So kickboxing is kick the top kickboxers
are more prepared to go into MMA and

8954
04:10:47,691 --> 04:10:50,430
not necessarily guys get taken down.

8955
04:10:50,450 --> 04:10:50,670
Yeah.

8956
04:10:50,670 --> 04:10:51,780
Everybody gets taken down.

8957
04:10:51,810 --> 04:10:52,860
So when they get taken down,

8958
04:10:52,861 --> 04:10:55,230
you know as well as anybody
does when they're fucked,

8959
04:10:55,290 --> 04:10:56,123
they're all fun.

8960
04:10:56,190 --> 04:10:57,690
The difference between the boxing,

8961
04:10:57,691 --> 04:10:58,950
like the best boxers,

8962
04:10:58,951 --> 04:11:00,360
they're hands are without a doubt.

8963
04:11:00,361 --> 04:11:01,960
Better than the best kick boxers.

8964
04:11:02,030 --> 04:11:02,280
Yeah.

8965
04:11:02,280 --> 04:11:06,240
But they don't have to be that good with
their hands because they got all these

8966
04:11:06,241 --> 04:11:07,074
other tools.

8967
04:11:07,110 --> 04:11:11,730
So they might have one skill that's like
maybe I would say like the Max of the

8968
04:11:11,731 --> 04:11:13,050
best kick boxers,

8969
04:11:13,051 --> 04:11:16,200
like 70% of the hands of a
world championship boxer.

8970
04:11:16,410 --> 04:11:16,880
Right.

8971
04:11:16,880 --> 04:11:17,910
If you want to look at it like a flow,

8972
04:11:17,940 --> 04:11:22,230
like a Roberto Duran and is proud where
the fuck punches like that in MMA,

8973
04:11:22,260 --> 04:11:23,093
right?

8974
04:11:23,130 --> 04:11:23,963
No one wait.

8975
04:11:24,050 --> 04:11:24,370
Yeah.

8976
04:11:24,370 --> 04:11:24,990
Kickboxing.

8977
04:11:24,990 --> 04:11:25,470
Okay.

8978
04:11:25,470 --> 04:11:26,600
Say this again you guys.

8979
04:11:27,010 --> 04:11:27,510
No,

8980
04:11:27,510 --> 04:11:27,840
no,

8981
04:11:27,840 --> 04:11:28,101
no,

8982
04:11:28,101 --> 04:11:28,281
no,

8983
04:11:28,281 --> 04:11:28,571
not,

8984
04:11:28,571 --> 04:11:29,404
not.

8985
04:11:30,160 --> 04:11:31,380
Maybe the guys maybe.

8986
04:11:31,620 --> 04:11:32,910
I don't think you can get there.

8987
04:11:32,911 --> 04:11:33,960
I don't think you can get there.

8988
04:11:33,961 --> 04:11:36,420
I think to maybe you got a sugar
ray Leonard as good as rot.

8989
04:11:36,430 --> 04:11:37,263
Roberta dress,

8990
04:11:39,010 --> 04:11:40,320
he gets to do knees,

8991
04:11:40,470 --> 04:11:41,303
elbows,

8992
04:11:41,440 --> 04:11:42,273
takedowns.

8993
04:11:42,980 --> 04:11:43,290
I mean,

8994
04:11:43,290 --> 04:11:43,531
look,

8995
04:11:43,531 --> 04:11:47,040
Robbie Lawler was a fucking savage and
I would never compare him unfavorably to

8996
04:11:47,041 --> 04:11:48,690
anybody because he's
like one of my all time.

8997
04:11:48,691 --> 04:11:48,971
Great.

8998
04:11:48,971 --> 04:11:53,520
Yours just as good as fucking
focused on boxing solely.

8999
04:11:53,670 --> 04:11:56,820
If he focused on boxing
solely or plot right now,

9000
04:11:56,880 --> 04:11:59,990
fuck in his prime sugar
ray Leonard and boxing.

9001
04:12:00,050 --> 04:12:00,611
Oh my God,

9002
04:12:00,611 --> 04:12:04,670
my brother who would inboxing
God inboxing to come on.

9003
04:12:04,710 --> 04:12:09,090
Do you have any idea what that would
look very similar to you having a fight

9004
04:12:09,091 --> 04:12:09,840
with sugar ray Leonard.

9005
04:12:09,840 --> 04:12:10,710
What about kickbox?

9006
04:12:11,770 --> 04:12:12,130
What about

9007
04:12:12,130 --> 04:12:12,963
in kickbox?

9008
04:12:13,600 --> 04:12:17,290
If they fought kickbox kind
of list kind of a fuck him up.

9009
04:12:17,310 --> 04:12:18,340
I mean you don't box it.

9010
04:12:18,400 --> 04:12:20,050
I did boy scouts for two years.

9011
04:12:21,520 --> 04:12:23,170
I did karate for one year.

9012
04:12:23,290 --> 04:12:24,560
I did Cass Magda,

9013
04:12:24,561 --> 04:12:27,760
which is again [inaudible]
system fucking years.

9014
04:12:28,530 --> 04:12:29,810
Did you hear what I just said?

9015
04:12:29,890 --> 04:12:31,660
Obviously Connor has
got really good hands.

9016
04:12:31,720 --> 04:12:36,640
He's obviously got a lethal power in its
punches and Mary that he'll carry that

9017
04:12:36,790 --> 04:12:38,200
somewhat in boxing,

9018
04:12:38,350 --> 04:12:39,490
but sugar ray Leonard,

9019
04:12:39,491 --> 04:12:41,110
if you watch his fights,

9020
04:12:41,410 --> 04:12:43,720
like when he was in his prime,

9021
04:12:43,990 --> 04:12:44,530
he was,

9022
04:12:44,530 --> 04:12:48,430
when he knocked out Tommy Hearns that
13th round after Angelo Dundee came back

9023
04:12:48,431 --> 04:12:48,671
and said,

9024
04:12:48,671 --> 04:12:49,660
you're blowing a kid.

9025
04:12:49,960 --> 04:12:52,660
And he went out there and
put it to Tommy Hearns.

9026
04:12:52,661 --> 04:12:53,060
Dude,

9027
04:12:53,060 --> 04:12:53,240
I'm,

9028
04:12:53,240 --> 04:12:54,073
I'm looking at you,

9029
04:12:54,100 --> 04:12:55,000
I'm not going to mention names,

9030
04:12:55,001 --> 04:13:00,001
but I've seen some world champion high
level UFC guys fight mediocre boxers and

9031
04:13:00,131 --> 04:13:00,964
just sparring,

9032
04:13:01,690 --> 04:13:04,260
sparring and they get this math.

9033
04:13:04,260 --> 04:13:05,200
Tell about when he lit up.

9034
04:13:05,201 --> 04:13:05,831
Floyd Mayweather,

9035
04:13:05,831 --> 04:13:07,690
his dad times of different
Floyd Mayweather,

9036
04:13:08,310 --> 04:13:08,890
Floyd Mayweather,

9037
04:13:08,890 --> 04:13:13,270
the senior from sugar ray Leonard Floyd
Mayweather senior was a world class box.

9038
04:13:13,271 --> 04:13:14,910
Amazing buzz uncles too.

9039
04:13:15,000 --> 04:13:15,410
Yeah,

9040
04:13:15,410 --> 04:13:16,180
Roger May with it.

9041
04:13:16,180 --> 04:13:17,170
Both the Black Mamba,

9042
04:13:17,200 --> 04:13:18,160
bad motherfucker.

9043
04:13:18,220 --> 04:13:21,010
Bad motherfucker come
out in the Mexican gear.

9044
04:13:21,190 --> 04:13:22,690
He's a bad motherfucker.

9045
04:13:23,230 --> 04:13:26,350
But his dad fought sugar ray
Leonard in his prime and he hung,

9046
04:13:26,380 --> 04:13:27,940
hung in with him for a little while,

9047
04:13:28,060 --> 04:13:29,510
but eventually sugary got him.

9048
04:13:29,540 --> 04:13:31,960
It was sugar ray like at his very best.

9049
04:13:32,020 --> 04:13:33,760
Tommy Hearns versus Marvin Hagler.

9050
04:13:35,150 --> 04:13:35,700
That's,

9051
04:13:35,700 --> 04:13:40,700
that's the shit that's going on right
now all around us and we won't realize

9052
04:13:40,751 --> 04:13:41,920
that for 30 years.

9053
04:13:42,230 --> 04:13:42,580
Yeah,

9054
04:13:42,580 --> 04:13:43,121
you're right.

9055
04:13:43,121 --> 04:13:43,980
You're a hundred percent sure

9056
04:13:46,570 --> 04:13:47,160
Thomas were.

9057
04:13:47,160 --> 04:13:48,070
We're living in it,

9058
04:13:48,280 --> 04:13:49,300
but it's so new to us.

9059
04:13:49,650 --> 04:13:51,790
We didn't know what the
difference is like music,

9060
04:13:51,850 --> 04:13:55,600
but there's like 10 Marvin hagglers
now and there's 10 Tommy Hearns.

9061
04:13:55,601 --> 04:13:56,530
It's like in MMA.

9062
04:13:56,531 --> 04:13:57,041
Look him up.

9063
04:13:57,041 --> 04:13:57,430
Anyway,

9064
04:13:57,430 --> 04:14:02,430
in MMA there's so many good fights and
then we have the boxing fights to the

9065
04:14:03,281 --> 04:14:04,870
boxing fights are exciting to

9066
04:14:07,870 --> 04:14:09,470
be the best of all time commercials.

9067
04:14:09,480 --> 04:14:10,910
Young kids are not into boxing.

9068
04:14:10,920 --> 04:14:11,910
I don't gigs or no,

9069
04:14:11,970 --> 04:14:12,210
no,

9070
04:14:12,210 --> 04:14:13,043
no.

9071
04:14:13,110 --> 04:14:13,600
That's not true.

9072
04:14:13,600 --> 04:14:14,870
A lot of kids are into boxing match,

9073
04:14:15,410 --> 04:14:16,243
Hbo,

9074
04:14:16,450 --> 04:14:16,841
Hbo,

9075
04:14:16,841 --> 04:14:18,400
Boxing PDS.

9076
04:14:18,430 --> 04:14:19,520
Who's getting a minnow?

9077
04:14:19,570 --> 04:14:20,870
Alvarez is a hero.

9078
04:14:23,860 --> 04:14:27,460
People love Kale or I don't you Mexicans.

9079
04:14:28,820 --> 04:14:29,653
Compatriot.

9080
04:14:30,010 --> 04:14:30,900
He's a bad motherfucker.

9081
04:14:31,010 --> 04:14:31,880
Know what?

9082
04:14:32,290 --> 04:14:33,250
He punches hard.

9083
04:14:33,520 --> 04:14:34,211
Who's a bad mother?

9084
04:14:34,211 --> 04:14:36,140
Bucker Canelo use the under Armour guy.

9085
04:14:36,280 --> 04:14:37,210
Tammy hits hard.

9086
04:14:37,211 --> 04:14:40,990
So you're an under Armour
guy showed you the shoes.

9087
04:14:41,170 --> 04:14:42,310
It says keep hammering.

9088
04:14:42,850 --> 04:14:43,271
That's right.

9089
04:14:43,271 --> 04:14:44,680
Remember Jesus Christ?

9090
04:14:44,710 --> 04:14:44,861
No,

9091
04:14:44,861 --> 04:14:45,401
I remember,

9092
04:14:45,401 --> 04:14:48,490
but I didn't know none
of that deal over them.

9093
04:14:49,660 --> 04:14:54,660
It's like the rock you and fucking Canela
I they take is just one pit Cesar for

9094
04:14:56,051 --> 04:14:58,260
the race they made to find that guy.

9095
04:14:58,990 --> 04:14:59,870
I can't hold that.

9096
04:14:59,880 --> 04:15:01,630
We can't have two
conversations at the same time.

9097
04:15:01,660 --> 04:15:02,111
Jamie,

9098
04:15:02,111 --> 04:15:07,060
let's find the baddest motherfucker
oil wrestling and listen,

9099
04:15:07,080 --> 04:15:07,930
I'll load them up.

9100
04:15:08,350 --> 04:15:10,780
Let's give him clucking Presto when,

9101
04:15:10,820 --> 04:15:13,970
so when I show the wolf one Instagram
that you were coming on the show,

9102
04:15:13,971 --> 04:15:14,850
my boy Cody dom,

9103
04:15:14,860 --> 04:15:15,201
he goes,

9104
04:15:15,201 --> 04:15:16,500
that guy's my hair out.

9105
04:15:16,790 --> 04:15:17,121
I was like,

9106
04:15:17,121 --> 04:15:17,720
really?

9107
04:15:17,720 --> 04:15:17,991
He's like,

9108
04:15:17,991 --> 04:15:18,201
yeah,

9109
04:15:18,201 --> 04:15:18,881
I guess hunting.

9110
04:15:18,881 --> 04:15:19,714
It's fucking,

9111
04:15:19,760 --> 04:15:20,593
you're the Mickey Mail.

9112
04:15:21,580 --> 04:15:22,850
Do you live in southern California?

9113
04:15:22,851 --> 04:15:23,684
And y'all

9114
04:15:24,830 --> 04:15:25,663
don't do that.

9115
04:15:25,760 --> 04:15:25,941
Oh,

9116
04:15:25,941 --> 04:15:26,480
that's right.

9117
04:15:26,480 --> 04:15:27,171
I'm going to see you.

9118
04:15:27,171 --> 04:15:28,490
And you're just a regular house,

9119
04:15:28,920 --> 04:15:29,631
but your house,

9120
04:15:29,631 --> 04:15:32,240
just a regular house like
in a regular shirt cabin.

9121
04:15:32,360 --> 04:15:35,990
Do you have like a mother
fucker eat dead deer?

9122
04:15:36,440 --> 04:15:36,591
Yeah.

9123
04:15:36,591 --> 04:15:37,460
There's dead deer in there.

9124
04:15:37,490 --> 04:15:38,323
In the shed?

9125
04:15:38,410 --> 04:15:38,690
No.

9126
04:15:38,690 --> 04:15:42,710
In the house with pro con

9127
04:15:44,330 --> 04:15:45,021
special thing.

9128
04:15:45,021 --> 04:15:45,854
You keep the

9129
04:15:48,260 --> 04:15:48,800
keep lies.

9130
04:15:48,800 --> 04:15:49,880
What do you do with the flies?

9131
04:15:50,300 --> 04:15:51,133
There's no flies.

9132
04:15:51,200 --> 04:15:52,033
Fly Paper.

9133
04:15:52,160 --> 04:15:52,791
No flies,

9134
04:15:52,791 --> 04:15:53,091
dude.

9135
04:15:53,091 --> 04:15:53,940
In the wintertime.

9136
04:15:54,020 --> 04:15:55,160
Most of the time when you're hunting,

9137
04:15:55,161 --> 04:15:58,250
you're hunting in the fall to about the
bees and the flies kind of go away for

9138
04:15:58,251 --> 04:15:58,851
the most part,

9139
04:15:58,851 --> 04:16:00,140
unless you're in a warm climate.

9140
04:16:00,230 --> 04:16:02,330
We saw a bunch of flies around this week.

9141
04:16:02,331 --> 04:16:03,141
We saw some flaws,

9142
04:16:03,141 --> 04:16:04,340
but if he was in Utah,

9143
04:16:04,520 --> 04:16:05,690
who wouldn't see any flies?

9144
04:16:05,750 --> 04:16:08,270
Now all debt he should
try hunting is not weird.

9145
04:16:08,300 --> 04:16:10,580
Gay fucking the jungle like in Costa Rica.

9146
04:16:10,581 --> 04:16:11,510
See what's up with that.

9147
04:16:11,600 --> 04:16:12,433
That's extreme.

9148
04:16:12,680 --> 04:16:13,513
That's extreme.

9149
04:16:13,640 --> 04:16:14,540
You gotta deal with the bugs.

9150
04:16:14,870 --> 04:16:18,290
There's a war with the bugs and you're
trying to get your fucking mammo.

9151
04:16:18,590 --> 04:16:21,770
You're trying to get your
Jaguar or a monkey or whatever,

9152
04:16:21,860 --> 04:16:24,970
but you got an a different
battle with the insects.

9153
04:16:25,030 --> 04:16:25,221
Joe,

9154
04:16:25,221 --> 04:16:25,791
check this out.

9155
04:16:25,791 --> 04:16:28,430
I had this guy when I was doing in that
area right there when I was doing that

9156
04:16:28,431 --> 04:16:29,360
Scifi show.

9157
04:16:29,600 --> 04:16:29,960
Um,

9158
04:16:29,960 --> 04:16:30,270
I,

9159
04:16:30,270 --> 04:16:30,740
um,

9160
04:16:30,740 --> 04:16:32,520
I had this guy on the show call.

9161
04:16:32,521 --> 04:16:33,830
His name is Peter Cortez.

9162
04:16:34,130 --> 04:16:35,600
He's a professor,

9163
04:16:35,601 --> 04:16:37,340
I think at the university.

9164
04:16:37,341 --> 04:16:38,174
Houston.

9165
04:16:38,330 --> 04:16:38,840
Really,

9166
04:16:38,840 --> 04:16:39,890
really smart dude.

9167
04:16:39,891 --> 04:16:40,310
But his,

9168
04:16:40,310 --> 04:16:45,310
his specialty is infectious
diseases in tropical climates.

9169
04:16:46,310 --> 04:16:48,410
Like parasites go on your deck.

9170
04:16:48,500 --> 04:16:48,771
No.

9171
04:16:48,771 --> 04:16:49,320
All,

9172
04:16:49,320 --> 04:16:49,650
all,

9173
04:16:49,650 --> 04:16:49,960
all,

9174
04:16:49,960 --> 04:16:51,830
all form of different parasites.

9175
04:16:52,220 --> 04:16:53,810
But this was what was really crazy.

9176
04:16:54,050 --> 04:16:59,050
He was saying that somewhere in like
the high 90% of all people in these

9177
04:16:59,811 --> 04:17:01,100
tropical climates,

9178
04:17:01,310 --> 04:17:02,870
I hope I'm not misquoting him.

9179
04:17:03,230 --> 04:17:05,900
They have some sort of infections.

9180
04:17:06,290 --> 04:17:08,360
They have some sort of
parasites living in them.

9181
04:17:09,260 --> 04:17:10,093
My jungle.

9182
04:17:10,130 --> 04:17:10,670
Yeah,

9183
04:17:10,670 --> 04:17:12,230
that seems totally straight.

9184
04:17:12,231 --> 04:17:14,270
They go on those lagoons
there covering the,

9185
04:17:14,750 --> 04:17:16,730
not even that Dick,

9186
04:17:16,790 --> 04:17:18,850
if that's a the food you're eating,

9187
04:17:18,851 --> 04:17:19,170
owning your,

9188
04:17:19,170 --> 04:17:22,220
but it's in like we're
talking about Lyme disease.

9189
04:17:22,221 --> 04:17:23,480
That's kind of a disease.

9190
04:17:23,510 --> 04:17:26,490
I mean it's like it kind of
a of a virus or a bacteria.

9191
04:17:26,510 --> 04:17:29,630
I don't know how you would describe
viruses from all the traveling.

9192
04:17:30,050 --> 04:17:30,883
No ticks.

9193
04:17:31,730 --> 04:17:32,151
Ticks.

9194
04:17:32,151 --> 04:17:32,890
Yeah.

9195
04:17:32,890 --> 04:17:33,620
What do you do with that?

9196
04:17:33,620 --> 04:17:34,453
How do you deal with that?

9197
04:17:35,140 --> 04:17:38,030
I've been bitten by a few
ticks and they bury in.

9198
04:17:38,720 --> 04:17:43,250
So I would take like a trying
to think what either knee,

9199
04:17:43,251 --> 04:17:47,570
I think I heat it up and needle and
stuck a tick and when they burn they back

9200
04:17:47,571 --> 04:17:48,080
out.

9201
04:17:48,080 --> 04:17:48,913
What?

9202
04:17:49,790 --> 04:17:50,601
Holy Shit.

9203
04:17:50,601 --> 04:17:51,440
I've been once then,

9204
04:17:51,441 --> 04:17:52,190
right?

9205
04:17:52,190 --> 04:17:52,431
No,

9206
04:17:52,431 --> 04:17:53,121
a few times.

9207
04:17:53,121 --> 04:17:53,730
But yeah,

9208
04:17:53,730 --> 04:17:55,670
the ticks because I dunno what happens,

9209
04:17:55,671 --> 04:17:57,290
but you can't feel them going in.

9210
04:17:57,291 --> 04:17:59,720
All of a sudden you kind of the saliva.

9211
04:17:59,721 --> 04:18:00,500
That's a numbing,

9212
04:18:00,500 --> 04:18:00,920
right,

9213
04:18:00,920 --> 04:18:04,040
so it must be something you think
you'd feel them bearing in your skin,

9214
04:18:04,041 --> 04:18:06,710
but you don't feel them till their
end and then you double check that.

9215
04:18:06,711 --> 04:18:07,544
Jamie,

9216
04:18:11,520 --> 04:18:16,520
has anybody ever had one of those
ticks bury themselves in the rectum?

9217
04:18:17,400 --> 04:18:17,581
Oh,

9218
04:18:17,581 --> 04:18:18,660
deepen the bottle there.

9219
04:18:18,661 --> 04:18:21,980
They go towards the
dark out when you stop,

9220
04:18:21,990 --> 04:18:23,970
like you know what is
that when you go vegan?

9221
04:18:24,650 --> 04:18:25,111
I don't know.

9222
04:18:25,111 --> 04:18:26,960
It's it crawls inside your butthole.

9223
04:18:27,170 --> 04:18:28,680
I just flush out APP.

9224
04:18:28,880 --> 04:18:29,701
It just keeps you out of it.

9225
04:18:29,701 --> 04:18:32,220
How many times does that have
to happen before you just say,

9226
04:18:33,180 --> 04:18:34,020
I want to go to boulder.

9227
04:18:34,980 --> 04:18:35,540
I haven't had,

9228
04:18:35,540 --> 04:18:37,080
I haven't had the belly,

9229
04:18:37,081 --> 04:18:39,090
but it's actually the softball size.

9230
04:18:39,090 --> 04:18:41,130
Tick their lives in gas now.

9231
04:18:41,131 --> 04:18:42,040
Ticks or cast.

9232
04:18:42,180 --> 04:18:43,080
It feels good.

9233
04:18:43,081 --> 04:18:43,711
You never know.

9234
04:18:43,711 --> 04:18:45,250
So I can,

9235
04:18:45,330 --> 04:18:46,560
when you're burning all these calories,

9236
04:18:46,561 --> 04:18:46,881
when you eat,

9237
04:18:46,881 --> 04:18:47,730
just whatever you want.

9238
04:18:47,790 --> 04:18:48,331
Fast food,

9239
04:18:48,331 --> 04:18:48,840
whatever.

9240
04:18:48,840 --> 04:18:49,260
No,

9241
04:18:49,260 --> 04:18:50,093
not fast

9242
04:18:51,530 --> 04:18:52,363
skin.

9243
04:18:53,510 --> 04:18:54,343
Oh my God.

9244
04:18:55,760 --> 04:18:56,710
What does this mean?

9245
04:18:57,720 --> 04:18:57,841
Hey,

9246
04:18:57,841 --> 04:18:58,674
listen,

9247
04:18:58,920 --> 04:18:59,840
this is pubic hair.

9248
04:18:59,860 --> 04:19:00,150
This.

9249
04:19:00,150 --> 04:19:00,901
We have children.

9250
04:19:00,901 --> 04:19:01,111
Listen,

9251
04:19:01,111 --> 04:19:02,910
I don't even want to know what this is.

9252
04:19:03,150 --> 04:19:04,950
It's a tick bite on your genitals.

9253
04:19:04,951 --> 04:19:05,900
Is that what was talking about?

9254
04:19:05,970 --> 04:19:07,990
Just put ticks on their
skin to start looking at,

9255
04:19:08,010 --> 04:19:09,240
oh my gosh.

9256
04:19:09,270 --> 04:19:10,850
They go look at that.

9257
04:19:12,140 --> 04:19:13,080
Smelled what do you do?

9258
04:19:13,081 --> 04:19:13,830
Have a tick.

9259
04:19:13,830 --> 04:19:14,390
I'm strong.

9260
04:19:14,390 --> 04:19:15,240
My sugar's too.

9261
04:19:15,241 --> 04:19:16,650
They get a tick too.

9262
04:19:16,651 --> 04:19:19,200
That's the thing about the world.

9263
04:19:20,170 --> 04:19:24,030
Tick a knows your ass and make different
bugs or just jacking each other.

9264
04:19:25,350 --> 04:19:26,183
What do you mean?

9265
04:19:27,000 --> 04:19:27,211
Oh,

9266
04:19:27,211 --> 04:19:28,040
killing each other.

9267
04:19:28,040 --> 04:19:30,480
The problem is attracted to
the smell of shit that it's,

9268
04:19:30,660 --> 04:19:31,860
if you don't wipe her ass right,

9269
04:19:31,890 --> 04:19:32,221
boom,

9270
04:19:32,221 --> 04:19:32,461
you're,

9271
04:19:32,461 --> 04:19:33,450
you're susceptible.

9272
04:19:33,620 --> 04:19:34,453
Probably

9273
04:19:36,040 --> 04:19:36,540
Browse.

9274
04:19:36,540 --> 04:19:37,740
Right dude.

9275
04:19:37,770 --> 04:19:38,550
Expect it.

9276
04:19:38,550 --> 04:19:39,510
Don't be surprised.

9277
04:19:39,920 --> 04:19:40,280
Well,

9278
04:19:40,280 --> 04:19:41,113
think about it.

9279
04:19:41,190 --> 04:19:45,360
Is that a wives tale that bear
are attracted to ministration?

9280
04:19:45,780 --> 04:19:47,790
I don't know cause I've heard that.

9281
04:19:47,820 --> 04:19:51,300
I believe I've heard
that 100% assumed that,

9282
04:19:51,301 --> 04:19:53,610
but I would think that people would be
afraid to say it because they don't want

9283
04:19:53,611 --> 04:19:57,210
to accuse women of being like in any way,

9284
04:19:57,211 --> 04:20:00,300
like bringing on the bears or,

9285
04:20:00,301 --> 04:20:01,790
and they don't want to address.

9286
04:20:01,930 --> 04:20:03,090
I find out that's true.

9287
04:20:03,240 --> 04:20:04,380
Bears not attracted,

9288
04:20:04,381 --> 04:20:04,621
says,

9289
04:20:04,621 --> 04:20:04,950
oh,

9290
04:20:04,950 --> 04:20:06,650
you fuck or not accept,

9291
04:20:06,651 --> 04:20:07,210
smell it.

9292
04:20:07,210 --> 04:20:11,930
We're not attracted polar bear guards,

9293
04:20:13,090 --> 04:20:15,510
but polar Stockholm.

9294
04:20:15,511 --> 04:20:16,560
I believe it though.

9295
04:20:16,660 --> 04:20:19,780
But it says polar bears may be interested
in the smell of menstrual blood.

9296
04:20:21,810 --> 04:20:26,100
They've eaten about a hundred
researchers with China's meanwhile.

9297
04:20:26,160 --> 04:20:26,560
Got me.

9298
04:20:26,560 --> 04:20:26,840
Well,

9299
04:20:26,840 --> 04:20:27,673
it's like a fucking,

9300
04:20:27,940 --> 04:20:28,910
this is the cover up.

9301
04:20:29,470 --> 04:20:30,360
They bought the song.

9302
04:20:30,480 --> 04:20:30,931
Meanwhile,

9303
04:20:30,931 --> 04:20:32,370
there's a fucking epidemic,

9304
04:20:32,371 --> 04:20:34,590
a bears eating female,

9305
04:20:34,920 --> 04:20:35,520
uh,

9306
04:20:35,520 --> 04:20:40,520
menstrual terse researchers that Jane
Goodall of the bears and like damn they

9307
04:20:41,911 --> 04:20:42,121
print.

9308
04:20:42,121 --> 04:20:43,770
They didn't tell him
about the menstruation.

9309
04:20:43,800 --> 04:20:44,880
That's some strong shit.

9310
04:20:44,910 --> 04:20:48,840
That's what's really scary about the
way some animals kill other animals as

9311
04:20:48,841 --> 04:20:49,200
they,

9312
04:20:49,200 --> 04:20:50,970
they go asshole first.

9313
04:20:50,971 --> 04:20:53,320
Look at that they're stuck asshole for,

9314
04:20:53,321 --> 04:20:54,500
but sometimes they do file.

9315
04:20:54,510 --> 04:20:55,001
It's junk.

9316
04:20:55,001 --> 04:20:55,834
Calm,

9317
04:20:55,950 --> 04:20:57,090
menstruating women.

9318
04:20:57,091 --> 04:20:59,600
Should you camp there's not attracted.

9319
04:20:59,760 --> 04:21:00,270
Well how bout,

9320
04:21:00,270 --> 04:21:02,630
how bout how crocodiles dude,

9321
04:21:02,650 --> 04:21:04,560
that wouldn't trust those don't bear man.

9322
04:21:05,260 --> 04:21:06,010
I wouldn't trust

9323
04:21:06,010 --> 04:21:09,490
my listening and the study designed
to test the hypothesis that bears are

9324
04:21:09,491 --> 04:21:09,971
attracted.

9325
04:21:09,971 --> 04:21:11,260
The odors of menstruation,

9326
04:21:11,610 --> 04:21:11,831
uh,

9327
04:21:11,831 --> 04:21:15,700
Cushing reported that when presented with
a series of different odors including

9328
04:21:15,701 --> 04:21:16,091
seals,

9329
04:21:16,091 --> 04:21:16,841
sense and other,

9330
04:21:16,841 --> 04:21:21,340
sends non menstrual human blood
and use tampons for Captain Jamie.

9331
04:21:21,940 --> 04:21:22,580
Thank you.

9332
04:21:22,580 --> 04:21:23,590
That was how dare you.

9333
04:21:24,790 --> 04:21:25,820
That was the end of why

9334
04:21:28,170 --> 04:21:28,930
he had to,

9335
04:21:28,930 --> 04:21:29,763
when I was,

9336
04:21:30,260 --> 04:21:31,093
uh,

9337
04:21:31,660 --> 04:21:32,493
I didn't finish it,

9338
04:21:32,860 --> 04:21:33,880
that I finished.

9339
04:21:34,930 --> 04:21:38,380
Four captains elicited a PR.

9340
04:21:38,410 --> 04:21:39,760
That party didn't get elicited.

9341
04:21:39,761 --> 04:21:40,570
The what?

9342
04:21:40,570 --> 04:21:41,410
This is good news.

9343
04:21:41,490 --> 04:21:42,520
Now what does it say?

9344
04:21:42,730 --> 04:21:45,300
You're going to go on for bears
and then you could show it.

9345
04:21:45,310 --> 04:21:47,530
You could tell your wife said
that these links and say,

9346
04:21:47,531 --> 04:21:48,364
look,

9347
04:21:48,370 --> 04:21:49,240
they go after periods.

9348
04:21:49,241 --> 04:21:50,074
We have to stop that.

9349
04:21:50,320 --> 04:21:51,700
I can't bring you.

9350
04:21:52,270 --> 04:21:53,880
I do want to bring you on this bear

9351
04:21:55,460 --> 04:21:56,293
desires.

9352
04:21:56,940 --> 04:21:58,450
I'm concerned for your safety.

9353
04:21:59,020 --> 04:22:00,490
Don't you start your rag mix.

9354
04:22:01,270 --> 04:22:01,481
I mean,

9355
04:22:01,481 --> 04:22:02,290
think about that.

9356
04:22:02,290 --> 04:22:03,070
Look at ways website.

9357
04:22:03,070 --> 04:22:03,640
Hold on a second.

9358
04:22:03,640 --> 04:22:04,473
Your links.

9359
04:22:05,680 --> 04:22:06,341
I can't see it.

9360
04:22:06,341 --> 04:22:06,611
Jamie.

9361
04:22:06,611 --> 04:22:07,211
That camera.

9362
04:22:07,211 --> 04:22:08,560
You got the camera set up there.

9363
04:22:11,200 --> 04:22:11,710
Okay,

9364
04:22:11,710 --> 04:22:12,510
that's good.

9365
04:22:12,510 --> 04:22:16,570
A strong behavioral response only
to seal sense and menstrual odors.

9366
04:22:16,600 --> 04:22:17,433
Use tampons.

9367
04:22:17,440 --> 04:22:17,861
Okay,

9368
04:22:17,861 --> 04:22:18,700
so it did.

9369
04:22:19,630 --> 04:22:20,770
So that's not true.

9370
04:22:21,220 --> 04:22:22,300
Those for polar bears.

9371
04:22:23,080 --> 04:22:24,550
For polar bears,

9372
04:22:24,551 --> 04:22:25,490
it's an attractive,

9373
04:22:25,491 --> 04:22:25,960
yeah,

9374
04:22:25,960 --> 04:22:30,070
I got to think that is where it's
going to smell it to any of that

9375
04:22:31,660 --> 04:22:32,440
other stuff.

9376
04:22:32,440 --> 04:22:34,150
There's probably other stuff they prefer.

9377
04:22:34,420 --> 04:22:35,171
All you got to say,

9378
04:22:35,171 --> 04:22:36,004
no.

9379
04:22:36,020 --> 04:22:36,521
Just came,

9380
04:22:36,521 --> 04:22:37,354
go.

9381
04:22:37,360 --> 04:22:38,620
When's the next Hunt Cam?

9382
04:22:38,740 --> 04:22:39,281
What and what?

9383
04:22:39,281 --> 04:22:41,430
Are you hunting a deer back home?

9384
04:22:41,450 --> 04:22:42,400
You bring in your wife?

9385
04:22:42,790 --> 04:22:43,180
No,

9386
04:22:43,180 --> 04:22:44,013
she has.

9387
04:22:44,150 --> 04:22:44,983
Perfect,

9388
04:22:45,650 --> 04:22:46,150
dear.

9389
04:22:46,150 --> 04:22:46,810
Cool,

9390
04:22:46,810 --> 04:22:47,260
dear.

9391
04:22:47,260 --> 04:22:48,093
Yeah,

9392
04:22:48,460 --> 04:22:48,701
Dude.

9393
04:22:48,701 --> 04:22:49,630
We sought mountain lions.

9394
04:22:49,870 --> 04:22:50,310
Really?

9395
04:22:50,310 --> 04:22:50,500
Yeah.

9396
04:22:50,500 --> 04:22:53,410
Was telling Mama and how many cubs
should have two or three bobcats.

9397
04:22:53,440 --> 04:22:53,921
Bobcats.

9398
04:22:53,921 --> 04:22:55,280
Did you attempt to cross paths?

9399
04:22:55,290 --> 04:22:55,690
Right?

9400
04:22:55,690 --> 04:22:56,780
We saw a a,

9401
04:22:56,980 --> 04:22:57,230
yeah,

9402
04:22:57,230 --> 04:22:58,031
a female.

9403
04:22:58,031 --> 04:22:58,810
Two kittens.

9404
04:22:58,810 --> 04:22:59,770
If you saw a female,

9405
04:22:59,771 --> 04:23:01,930
might be worried at all the
other smaller Catholics.

9406
04:23:03,370 --> 04:23:04,600
I think that one of them was,

9407
04:23:04,601 --> 04:23:04,931
I thought,

9408
04:23:04,931 --> 04:23:07,510
why don't I think it was
through a little cougar now too.

9409
04:23:07,511 --> 04:23:09,190
Why was I needed in my mind?

9410
04:23:09,700 --> 04:23:10,930
I saw it so quick.

9411
04:23:11,080 --> 04:23:14,020
This is a shitty memory is
or you're higher in my mind.

9412
04:23:14,021 --> 04:23:14,440
No,

9413
04:23:14,440 --> 04:23:14,801
no.

9414
04:23:14,801 --> 04:23:15,610
He smoke weed.

9415
04:23:15,610 --> 04:23:16,240
Fuck yeah.

9416
04:23:16,240 --> 04:23:17,050
You saw me.

9417
04:23:17,050 --> 04:23:17,920
You brought no,

9418
04:23:17,921 --> 04:23:18,161
no,

9419
04:23:18,161 --> 04:23:19,080
not too long.

9420
04:23:19,770 --> 04:23:20,650
He thought it was a mountain lion.

9421
04:23:20,910 --> 04:23:21,743
No dog.

9422
04:23:21,760 --> 04:23:21,911
No,

9423
04:23:21,911 --> 04:23:22,540
I didn't bring anything.

9424
04:23:22,540 --> 04:23:22,981
No,

9425
04:23:22,981 --> 04:23:23,620
no,

9426
04:23:23,620 --> 04:23:24,220
no,

9427
04:23:24,220 --> 04:23:25,053
no.

9428
04:23:27,270 --> 04:23:28,420
You were in the woods.

9429
04:23:28,421 --> 04:23:28,770
Heady.

9430
04:23:28,770 --> 04:23:28,961
Heady.

9431
04:23:28,961 --> 04:23:29,590
Hold on a second.

9432
04:23:29,590 --> 04:23:30,700
I thought those things were,

9433
04:23:30,730 --> 04:23:32,590
I thought those things were a cougars.

9434
04:23:33,190 --> 04:23:34,330
Now the big Bobcat,

9435
04:23:34,360 --> 04:23:36,400
how you can tell like quickly as the tail,

9436
04:23:36,430 --> 04:23:37,420
they were really small.

9437
04:23:37,510 --> 04:23:37,721
Yeah,

9438
04:23:37,721 --> 04:23:38,291
they're small.

9439
04:23:38,291 --> 04:23:39,610
But a mountain lion.

9440
04:23:39,611 --> 04:23:42,460
You're always going to
notice a tail long tail man.

9441
04:23:42,461 --> 04:23:44,530
That's interesting cause
it was such a brief thing.

9442
04:23:44,560 --> 04:23:49,560
You guys said it first and then I turned
and saw him for such a maybe half a

9443
04:23:50,201 --> 04:23:51,910
second wait a second before they bolted.

9444
04:23:52,090 --> 04:23:56,500
And I'm thinking that sometimes when
you expect to see something like,

9445
04:23:56,501 --> 04:24:01,000
so I think maybe Brian had said
cat and maybe I thought Cougar.

9446
04:24:01,050 --> 04:24:01,401
Yeah,

9447
04:24:01,401 --> 04:24:03,680
so maybe it was just a flash in my mind.

9448
04:24:03,681 --> 04:24:05,030
Filled in the blanks.

9449
04:24:05,060 --> 04:24:05,720
Yeah.

9450
04:24:05,720 --> 04:24:06,710
Which is shocking.

9451
04:24:06,740 --> 04:24:08,220
That happens with shots.

9452
04:24:08,490 --> 04:24:11,450
Most dangerous cat and
this part of the world.

9453
04:24:11,510 --> 04:24:13,700
Mal mine more than a bobcat.

9454
04:24:14,240 --> 04:24:14,540
Yeah.

9455
04:24:14,540 --> 04:24:15,170
Oh yeah.

9456
04:24:15,170 --> 04:24:15,850
Amount amount.

9457
04:24:15,850 --> 04:24:19,790
Mine can be 170 pounds and stock you yeah.

9458
04:24:19,840 --> 04:24:20,600
Has been stopped.

9459
04:24:20,600 --> 04:24:22,700
Once you realize you're being stocked,

9460
04:24:22,701 --> 04:24:24,260
is there a point you
want to watch a video?

9461
04:24:24,350 --> 04:24:26,650
Usually you don't realize it.

9462
04:24:26,870 --> 04:24:29,210
They realize you're being
stocked at that point.

9463
04:24:29,360 --> 04:24:31,310
Is that mission number
one to watch this video,

9464
04:24:31,311 --> 04:24:32,180
we're going to watch this video,

9465
04:24:32,290 --> 04:24:32,770
right?

9466
04:24:32,770 --> 04:24:33,800
Video stock.

9467
04:24:34,100 --> 04:24:34,881
Put It on Youtube,

9468
04:24:34,881 --> 04:24:38,270
but we can watch it on youtube
so nobody else sees it.

9469
04:24:38,570 --> 04:24:38,991
But uh,

9470
04:24:38,991 --> 04:24:43,130
that a guy who got stocked who was on a
mountain bike and he got stocked by this

9471
04:24:43,490 --> 04:24:46,250
mountain mine who got
within inside of 20 yards.

9472
04:24:46,420 --> 04:24:46,940
Do we get them?

9473
04:24:46,940 --> 04:24:48,770
Is walking slowly at them like this,

9474
04:24:48,771 --> 04:24:49,511
like out in the open.

9475
04:24:49,511 --> 04:24:50,780
Let me see that out in the open.

9476
04:24:50,781 --> 04:24:51,411
Staring at him.

9477
04:24:51,411 --> 04:24:53,390
It is fucking horrific dude.

9478
04:24:53,720 --> 04:24:54,980
It scares the shit out of me.

9479
04:24:55,210 --> 04:24:55,390
Who?

9480
04:24:55,390 --> 04:24:56,223
This cat,

9481
04:24:56,840 --> 04:25:00,500
this dude is just hanging
out in his fucking cat.

9482
04:25:00,500 --> 04:25:01,460
Keeps coming close to him.

9483
04:25:01,580 --> 04:25:02,001
What is it?

9484
04:25:02,001 --> 04:25:02,960
So we can give the dude,

9485
04:25:02,980 --> 04:25:03,350
uh,

9486
04:25:03,350 --> 04:25:05,450
some props and he can
get some views on it.

9487
04:25:05,570 --> 04:25:07,670
It says mountain lion standoff with hiker.

9488
04:25:07,790 --> 04:25:08,330
So this,

9489
04:25:08,330 --> 04:25:09,051
this gentleman,

9490
04:25:09,051 --> 04:25:09,771
whoever he was,

9491
04:25:09,771 --> 04:25:10,604
it was the hiker.

9492
04:25:10,850 --> 04:25:15,560
He was yelling here and the cat just
keeps getting closer and closer to him and

9493
04:25:15,561 --> 04:25:18,500
he got fucking super sure to take off.

9494
04:25:18,660 --> 04:25:20,330
Do they got super sketchy?

9495
04:25:20,660 --> 04:25:22,160
That cat was for sure.

9496
04:25:22,161 --> 04:25:23,300
Thinking about eating him.

9497
04:25:24,380 --> 04:25:25,250
Did he have a gun?

9498
04:25:25,610 --> 04:25:26,660
I don't think he did.

9499
04:25:26,720 --> 04:25:27,700
He just got loud.

9500
04:25:27,860 --> 04:25:28,693
Was it the time?

9501
04:25:29,060 --> 04:25:29,893
Yeah.

9502
04:25:29,900 --> 04:25:30,640
Um,

9503
04:25:30,640 --> 04:25:32,270
Tennessee at Jamie

9504
04:25:33,990 --> 04:25:35,930
shitty glacier national park.

9505
04:25:36,310 --> 04:25:37,143
Where's that at?

9506
04:25:37,870 --> 04:25:38,201
Cam?

9507
04:25:38,201 --> 04:25:39,910
Where's glacier national park and he said,

9508
04:25:39,911 --> 04:25:40,744
hey bud.

9509
04:25:40,750 --> 04:25:42,970
He called them Alaska.

9510
04:25:43,030 --> 04:25:45,310
Is it called?

9511
04:25:45,311 --> 04:25:45,671
And we said,

9512
04:25:45,671 --> 04:25:46,240
hey buy,

9513
04:25:46,240 --> 04:25:48,490
I don't think they have a lot
of mountain lions in Alaska.

9514
04:25:48,670 --> 04:25:48,971
Do they?

9515
04:25:48,971 --> 04:25:50,380
Cam Glacier.

9516
04:25:50,410 --> 04:25:51,720
That's a big little fucker.

9517
04:25:51,721 --> 04:25:52,570
That mother Fucker,

9518
04:25:52,571 --> 04:25:54,340
that's how fucking tiger right there.

9519
04:25:54,341 --> 04:25:54,561
Dude.

9520
04:25:54,561 --> 04:25:55,600
That is so scary.

9521
04:25:55,601 --> 04:26:00,601
That cat that no rules have in
motherfucker is closing in just an optical

9522
04:26:02,441 --> 04:26:02,760
illusion.

9523
04:26:02,760 --> 04:26:05,890
Terrible way to die on
an optical illusion.

9524
04:26:05,891 --> 04:26:06,071
Look,

9525
04:26:06,071 --> 04:26:07,330
a hundred pound cat.

9526
04:26:07,331 --> 04:26:08,620
Like if you see a German shepherd,

9527
04:26:08,800 --> 04:26:10,000
German shepherd wants to fuck you up.

9528
04:26:10,001 --> 04:26:10,451
You're scared.

9529
04:26:10,451 --> 04:26:10,780
Right?

9530
04:26:10,780 --> 04:26:12,490
German shepard might weigh 70 pounds.

9531
04:26:12,910 --> 04:26:13,151
Okay.

9532
04:26:13,151 --> 04:26:14,500
That's not a big animal at all,

9533
04:26:14,650 --> 04:26:16,960
but yet they will most likely fuck you up.

9534
04:26:17,030 --> 04:26:17,400
Yeah,

9535
04:26:17,400 --> 04:26:20,470
he all those belts and Malcolm was
that they use for the police academy.

9536
04:26:20,630 --> 04:26:24,010
Think that those are actually like more
likely to be in the 60s and 70 lbs.

9537
04:26:24,340 --> 04:26:25,850
German shepherds can
get a little bit bigger.

9538
04:26:26,760 --> 04:26:26,950
No,

9539
04:26:26,950 --> 04:26:27,101
no,

9540
04:26:27,101 --> 04:26:27,491
he's not.

9541
04:26:27,491 --> 04:26:28,510
He just doesn't know what to do.

9542
04:26:28,930 --> 04:26:29,830
So he's making this video,

9543
04:26:29,831 --> 04:26:31,000
this guy shit in his pants.

9544
04:26:31,060 --> 04:26:31,893
Yeah,

9545
04:26:33,080 --> 04:26:33,913
that was awesome.

9546
04:26:35,320 --> 04:26:36,153
That was awesome.

9547
04:26:37,840 --> 04:26:40,720
There's a gang of those
videos and occasionally,

9548
04:26:40,960 --> 04:26:42,750
occasionally people go missing.

9549
04:26:42,790 --> 04:26:44,440
They just grabbed her
women and children though.

9550
04:26:44,830 --> 04:26:45,521
Not that guy.

9551
04:26:45,521 --> 04:26:49,150
That guy was a man and that
might've kept him from being killed.

9552
04:26:49,151 --> 04:26:50,320
Maybe if that was a child,

9553
04:26:50,560 --> 04:26:51,700
the cat wouldn't have hesitated.

9554
04:26:51,810 --> 04:26:52,140
Yeah.

9555
04:26:52,140 --> 04:26:52,270
Okay.

9556
04:26:52,270 --> 04:26:52,461
What did,

9557
04:26:52,461 --> 04:26:54,250
he just killed them and it's happened.

9558
04:26:54,310 --> 04:26:54,581
I mean,

9559
04:26:54,581 --> 04:26:58,090
there was a guy in Cupertino who watched
his kid get attacked by a mountain lion

9560
04:26:58,091 --> 04:27:00,200
just a year and a half
ago and killed Tina was,

9561
04:27:00,490 --> 04:27:01,950
they chased it off

9562
04:27:02,160 --> 04:27:04,410
and I think then the animal skinny.

9563
04:27:04,660 --> 04:27:04,951
Oh,

9564
04:27:04,951 --> 04:27:05,780
look at their thing.

9565
04:27:05,780 --> 04:27:06,710
That star.

9566
04:27:07,020 --> 04:27:08,070
Look at that right arm.

9567
04:27:08,550 --> 04:27:09,540
She's checked.

9568
04:27:09,600 --> 04:27:09,780
Oh,

9569
04:27:09,780 --> 04:27:13,470
so you'd have the most
ridiculous reco Roman skills.

9570
04:27:14,460 --> 04:27:17,760
You're going to go take a walk in the
woods during your mother fucking rive.

9571
04:27:17,770 --> 04:27:18,603
How skinny.

9572
04:27:19,110 --> 04:27:19,943
Starving.

9573
04:27:19,950 --> 04:27:21,120
So then he's dangerous.

9574
04:27:21,121 --> 04:27:21,601
Look at it,

9575
04:27:21,601 --> 04:27:21,980
dude.

9576
04:27:21,980 --> 04:27:22,813
Oh my God.

9577
04:27:23,110 --> 04:27:24,550
They're straight up killers.

9578
04:27:25,010 --> 04:27:25,480
Ooh,

9579
04:27:25,480 --> 04:27:26,313
look at that.

9580
04:27:26,370 --> 04:27:29,100
That is so dangerous and it's just,

9581
04:27:29,190 --> 04:27:31,200
it's just not sure whether
or not you got to bang stick.

9582
04:27:31,500 --> 04:27:31,841
I mean,

9583
04:27:31,841 --> 04:27:35,840
you think about how the banks that gun
think about trying to hold down a house

9584
04:27:35,910 --> 04:27:36,690
house cat.

9585
04:27:36,690 --> 04:27:40,410
If it doesn't have to be
held down 1510 pounds,

9586
04:27:40,970 --> 04:27:42,360
150 killed the cat.

9587
04:27:42,810 --> 04:27:43,650
Jesus Christ.

9588
04:27:43,651 --> 04:27:44,640
Those things are scary.

9589
04:27:45,030 --> 04:27:48,480
What's really weird is that we love
them and we want them around us,

9590
04:27:48,510 --> 04:27:49,680
but not so close.

9591
04:27:51,490 --> 04:27:52,281
Look at that one that went,

9592
04:27:52,281 --> 04:27:52,951
ran after the,

9593
04:27:52,951 --> 04:27:55,560
no check any sprayed it in
the trace on the far right.

9594
04:27:55,561 --> 04:27:59,430
Greatest Tiger attacks ever caught on
camera rounds necessarily thinking,

9595
04:27:59,431 --> 04:28:01,650
I want to look at that 7 million views.

9596
04:28:02,690 --> 04:28:04,770
As long as it doesn't get
us kicked off of Youtube,

9597
04:28:04,771 --> 04:28:05,320
Jamie,

9598
04:28:05,320 --> 04:28:07,020
because we get so no
one else could see it.

9599
04:28:07,021 --> 04:28:07,854
It's crazy.

9600
04:28:08,860 --> 04:28:12,870
This was the one when the dudes on the
top of an elephant and the tiger decides

9601
04:28:12,871 --> 04:28:13,704
to row,

9602
04:28:14,250 --> 04:28:15,800
look at this whole running out.

9603
04:28:17,010 --> 04:28:17,221
I mean,

9604
04:28:17,221 --> 04:28:17,881
look at this thing.

9605
04:28:17,881 --> 04:28:19,320
Flies through the air.

9606
04:28:19,820 --> 04:28:20,653
Oh yeah.

9607
04:28:22,730 --> 04:28:23,760
He threw a machete at,

9608
04:28:23,761 --> 04:28:24,750
oh my God.

9609
04:28:25,020 --> 04:28:25,853
Damn.

9610
04:28:27,310 --> 04:28:28,440
Tours are apart.

9611
04:28:28,590 --> 04:28:29,311
He shouldn't have time.

9612
04:28:29,311 --> 04:28:31,240
That machete a lot better than that.

9613
04:28:32,630 --> 04:28:33,000
You're like,

9614
04:28:33,000 --> 04:28:33,391
oh shit,

9615
04:28:33,391 --> 04:28:34,350
you can't pull it back.

9616
04:28:34,860 --> 04:28:36,150
A little dog.

9617
04:28:36,300 --> 04:28:37,133
Oh my God.

9618
04:28:37,980 --> 04:28:39,180
Oh Shit.

9619
04:28:39,990 --> 04:28:41,100
Oh God.

9620
04:28:41,101 --> 04:28:41,970
That was quick.

9621
04:28:42,520 --> 04:28:43,450
C.

9622
04:28:43,450 --> 04:28:43,470
Dot.

9623
04:28:43,470 --> 04:28:44,303
Oh my God.

9624
04:28:44,810 --> 04:28:45,940
Kill Tigers.

9625
04:28:45,960 --> 04:28:49,350
Kills 14 foot crocodile dude.

9626
04:28:49,380 --> 04:28:52,410
There's a video that I just watched the
other day of a tiger making a run at a

9627
04:28:52,411 --> 04:28:54,960
guy and then at the last minute it turns.

9628
04:28:55,470 --> 04:28:59,400
But as it's angry and it's in full
fury and it's making a runner,

9629
04:28:59,430 --> 04:29:01,770
it moves so much quicker
than I thought they could.

9630
04:29:02,400 --> 04:29:03,450
So much quicker.

9631
04:29:03,990 --> 04:29:06,180
It was like a fucking regular cat,

9632
04:29:06,210 --> 04:29:07,890
but like 600 pounds,

9633
04:29:10,020 --> 04:29:11,010
tiger kills.

9634
04:29:11,011 --> 04:29:12,790
What slot there?

9635
04:29:12,870 --> 04:29:13,710
Oh my God.

9636
04:29:13,770 --> 04:29:13,921
Oh,

9637
04:29:13,921 --> 04:29:14,820
these guys are dead.

9638
04:29:15,150 --> 04:29:15,990
Everybody's dead.

9639
04:29:16,020 --> 04:29:17,070
They killed crocodiles,

9640
04:29:17,071 --> 04:29:17,904
dude.

9641
04:29:18,590 --> 04:29:20,820
Have you seen those ones
and Jaguars in Brazil?

9642
04:29:21,260 --> 04:29:23,190
The jumping it right.

9643
04:29:23,520 --> 04:29:24,353
My God.

9644
04:29:25,320 --> 04:29:27,780
The goal thing across it's warm enough.

9645
04:29:27,870 --> 04:29:28,920
I was talking about leopard,

9646
04:29:28,921 --> 04:29:29,671
so I think,

9647
04:29:29,671 --> 04:29:30,780
or Jaguars rather,

9648
04:29:31,140 --> 04:29:34,710
which are even smaller than tigers
and they kill those Caymans in Brazil.

9649
04:29:35,160 --> 04:29:36,990
There's a bunch of those
videos that come behind them.

9650
04:29:37,620 --> 04:29:39,390
They treat them like their food man.

9651
04:29:39,420 --> 04:29:40,350
They just jack them.

9652
04:29:40,380 --> 04:29:40,561
Dude.

9653
04:29:40,561 --> 04:29:42,210
How fucking scares a tiger though,

9654
04:29:42,220 --> 04:29:43,220
thinks she's huge,

9655
04:29:43,240 --> 04:29:43,690
man.

9656
04:29:43,690 --> 04:29:48,160
I get this thing is chasing after these
fees about like those African lions look

9657
04:29:48,340 --> 04:29:49,170
thing.

9658
04:29:49,170 --> 04:29:50,790
But imagine you're in this fucking,

9659
04:29:50,850 --> 04:29:52,170
because tigers are little truck,

9660
04:29:52,171 --> 04:29:53,004
much larger,

9661
04:29:53,100 --> 04:29:53,851
700 pounds.

9662
04:29:53,851 --> 04:29:55,260
I buy off on the choice.

9663
04:29:55,350 --> 04:29:57,450
You want to live around tigers
that he wanted to live around.

9664
04:29:57,451 --> 04:29:58,920
Criminals have guns on the street,

9665
04:29:58,930 --> 04:30:00,370
criminals at the same shit.

9666
04:30:00,371 --> 04:30:01,204
Criminals.

9667
04:30:01,480 --> 04:30:06,340
They probably think we're fucking crazy
that there's humans with guns shooting

9668
04:30:06,341 --> 04:30:09,030
people and all they got
to do is deal with tight.

9669
04:30:09,850 --> 04:30:10,870
Looking at this video,

9670
04:30:10,871 --> 04:30:13,660
this tiger is just slowly
stocking these fucking people.

9671
04:30:14,080 --> 04:30:18,070
There's a truck behind him and there's
a truck in front of them and this tiger

9672
04:30:18,071 --> 04:30:19,090
is just Strutton.

9673
04:30:20,290 --> 04:30:20,591
Dude,

9674
04:30:20,591 --> 04:30:24,400
this is scary and that tiger
is just trying to figure
out what it's going to do.

9675
04:30:24,760 --> 04:30:26,800
And this is a video called tiger attacks.

9676
04:30:27,040 --> 04:30:27,873
What's scary?

9677
04:30:28,930 --> 04:30:30,100
I'm shitting my pants right now.

9678
04:30:30,101 --> 04:30:30,700
Motherfucker.

9679
04:30:30,700 --> 04:30:35,320
I don't know tiger like that
or a government official
that wants you suicide.

9680
04:30:35,650 --> 04:30:36,190
Tiger.

9681
04:30:36,190 --> 04:30:36,540
Eddie.

9682
04:30:36,540 --> 04:30:37,373
Okay.

9683
04:30:37,960 --> 04:30:39,520
Moment moment.

9684
04:30:39,610 --> 04:30:41,260
I just feel like the government officials,

9685
04:30:41,410 --> 04:30:42,243
I don't know.

9686
04:30:42,370 --> 04:30:42,910
I don't know.

9687
04:30:42,910 --> 04:30:43,561
Maybe you're right.

9688
04:30:43,561 --> 04:30:44,800
Coax into enlightenment.

9689
04:30:45,040 --> 04:30:45,580
You're right.

9690
04:30:45,580 --> 04:30:45,721
Yeah.

9691
04:30:45,721 --> 04:30:47,200
There's no talking to this tiger.

9692
04:30:47,260 --> 04:30:49,790
This tiger doesn't give
a fuck if the trade off

9693
04:30:51,490 --> 04:30:52,760
Jesus Christ here comes.

9694
04:30:53,440 --> 04:30:54,940
Oh God.

9695
04:30:55,680 --> 04:30:56,000
Oh,

9696
04:30:56,000 --> 04:30:57,820
she's like the Blair witch camera work.

9697
04:30:59,590 --> 04:31:00,610
Oh my God.

9698
04:31:00,611 --> 04:31:02,170
They're running away from this tiger.

9699
04:31:02,210 --> 04:31:02,580
I hit.

9700
04:31:02,580 --> 04:31:04,440
Man's not going to
scrape the skin off the,

9701
04:31:07,110 --> 04:31:08,500
that's the trade off.

9702
04:31:09,370 --> 04:31:11,080
I'm so scared of those goddamn things.

9703
04:31:11,140 --> 04:31:11,400
Yeah,

9704
04:31:11,400 --> 04:31:12,970
I tell you that video.

9705
04:31:14,580 --> 04:31:15,111
No Tigris.

9706
04:31:15,111 --> 04:31:15,380
Paul.

9707
04:31:15,380 --> 04:31:19,570
I think that that video in Beijing or
that chick gets in an argument with

9708
04:31:19,571 --> 04:31:21,380
someone and she gets out of the car

9709
04:31:23,670 --> 04:31:24,680
right here.

9710
04:31:25,180 --> 04:31:26,013
Yeah.

9711
04:31:27,040 --> 04:31:27,431
She's like,

9712
04:31:27,431 --> 04:31:28,750
fuck this bitch.

9713
04:31:28,920 --> 04:31:31,510
Watch three cars.

9714
04:31:32,390 --> 04:31:32,850
Car.

9715
04:31:32,850 --> 04:31:34,630
What is the genuine car?

9716
04:31:34,690 --> 04:31:35,523
Beijing.

9717
04:31:36,630 --> 04:31:36,790
Yeah.

9718
04:31:36,790 --> 04:31:37,900
Watch regular.

9719
04:31:37,901 --> 04:31:38,440
Stay there.

9720
04:31:38,440 --> 04:31:41,170
She's all Stretton do shit.

9721
04:31:42,660 --> 04:31:43,493
Go home.

9722
04:31:43,660 --> 04:31:44,170
Look at this.

9723
04:31:44,170 --> 04:31:44,891
You ain't doing shit.

9724
04:31:44,891 --> 04:31:47,530
That tiger white washed out
of the car just sitting there.

9725
04:31:48,640 --> 04:31:50,150
Why is that red car just sitting here?

9726
04:31:50,400 --> 04:31:51,100
They're all,

9727
04:31:51,100 --> 04:31:52,480
they're all on a sofar.

9728
04:31:52,481 --> 04:31:56,020
We'd drive down the road in your
car and need to see these animals.

9729
04:31:56,080 --> 04:31:57,440
She thinks she didn't die.

9730
04:31:57,441 --> 04:31:58,600
The guy right after it.

9731
04:31:58,610 --> 04:31:58,910
No,

9732
04:31:58,910 --> 04:31:59,970
the mark.

9733
04:32:01,820 --> 04:32:02,311
I get it.

9734
04:32:02,311 --> 04:32:02,860
It's a point.

9735
04:32:02,860 --> 04:32:07,330
I do not want to see that guy's arm
bar ripped off like that God damn car.

9736
04:32:07,540 --> 04:32:09,530
You're in fucking lying countries.

9737
04:32:09,540 --> 04:32:10,373
Safari.

9738
04:32:10,660 --> 04:32:11,493
San Diego.

9739
04:32:13,140 --> 04:32:13,973
Oh,

9740
04:32:15,220 --> 04:32:15,371
he,

9741
04:32:15,371 --> 04:32:18,440
this guy was trying to
convince these lions.

9742
04:32:18,790 --> 04:32:20,680
Christianity was the way to do it.

9743
04:32:22,230 --> 04:32:23,230
I think they believe him.

9744
04:32:23,290 --> 04:32:23,951
I don't know why,

9745
04:32:23,951 --> 04:32:25,030
but oh my God.

9746
04:32:25,031 --> 04:32:26,260
That guy got fucked up.

9747
04:32:28,240 --> 04:32:29,880
He is in a bad spot.

9748
04:32:29,881 --> 04:32:30,714
I believe him.

9749
04:32:31,300 --> 04:32:33,100
He jumped into the exhibit.

9750
04:32:33,550 --> 04:32:33,881
Yeah,

9751
04:32:33,881 --> 04:32:34,350
man.

9752
04:32:34,350 --> 04:32:38,050
God is stronger than
any of us can imagine.

9753
04:32:38,080 --> 04:32:38,891
Brian fucked up.

9754
04:32:38,891 --> 04:32:39,221
Look at it.

9755
04:32:39,221 --> 04:32:39,641
What they're doing,

9756
04:32:39,641 --> 04:32:42,040
they have to spray these lot of stamp.

9757
04:32:42,050 --> 04:32:43,450
The cats really hate water.

9758
04:32:43,720 --> 04:32:43,961
Well,

9759
04:32:43,961 --> 04:32:46,060
they just don't like being changed.

9760
04:32:46,750 --> 04:32:47,381
Oh my God.

9761
04:32:47,381 --> 04:32:49,480
There's the leper that came out
of the roof and fuck these guys.

9762
04:32:50,810 --> 04:32:51,940
They need a baseball bat.

9763
04:32:52,150 --> 04:32:53,630
A little baby one like those,

9764
04:32:53,660 --> 04:32:53,990
uh,

9765
04:32:53,990 --> 04:32:54,701
those little one.

9766
04:32:54,701 --> 04:32:57,490
So he busted God right that boom.

9767
04:32:57,500 --> 04:32:58,570
Right in the season.

9768
04:33:00,150 --> 04:33:00,650
Yeah.

9769
04:33:00,650 --> 04:33:01,251
He's scared.

9770
04:33:01,251 --> 04:33:05,180
Look at fuck those cats because
cats are terrifying dude.

9771
04:33:06,590 --> 04:33:07,423
Oh,

9772
04:33:07,530 --> 04:33:09,610
that's that real flat.

9773
04:33:09,710 --> 04:33:10,610
The living room.

9774
04:33:10,850 --> 04:33:11,750
Oh my God.

9775
04:33:11,930 --> 04:33:12,763
That's real

9776
04:33:14,410 --> 04:33:14,810
thing.

9777
04:33:14,810 --> 04:33:16,820
We get the biggest cat in Indonesia.

9778
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:22,490
There were on a TV show in Indonesia.

9779
04:33:23,630 --> 04:33:24,500
Oh my God.

9780
04:33:24,501 --> 04:33:26,600
These silly bitches are
in the cage with them.

9781
04:33:26,820 --> 04:33:27,653
It's trying to fuck him.

9782
04:33:27,740 --> 04:33:28,510
Yeah,

9783
04:33:28,510 --> 04:33:29,270
it's try the phone.

9784
04:33:29,270 --> 04:33:30,380
I was gone for that Dick.

9785
04:33:30,410 --> 04:33:31,050
You know what?

9786
04:33:31,050 --> 04:33:32,950
God hurts.

9787
04:33:33,000 --> 04:33:33,380
Oh,

9788
04:33:33,380 --> 04:33:34,360
my face.

9789
04:33:35,390 --> 04:33:35,931
Oh No.

9790
04:33:35,931 --> 04:33:36,920
For his face.

9791
04:33:37,030 --> 04:33:38,390
We going to get hit him on the head.

9792
04:33:38,780 --> 04:33:40,790
It looks like folks,

9793
04:33:40,910 --> 04:33:42,500
that's not a full size tiger either.

9794
04:33:42,501 --> 04:33:43,251
That's like a baby.

9795
04:33:43,251 --> 04:33:43,851
It's feeling as,

9796
04:33:43,851 --> 04:33:44,090
oh,

9797
04:33:44,090 --> 04:33:44,923
that's the female.

9798
04:33:45,080 --> 04:33:47,290
Imagine those laws
digging into that asset.

9799
04:33:47,360 --> 04:33:50,380
A lion has claws.

9800
04:33:50,420 --> 04:33:51,170
Lioness.

9801
04:33:51,170 --> 04:33:52,003
I'm too drunk.

9802
04:33:52,370 --> 04:33:54,060
Imagine I forgot my species deep.

9803
04:33:54,110 --> 04:33:56,000
Those clouds are right up his ass,

9804
04:33:56,001 --> 04:33:56,661
but she's young,

9805
04:33:56,661 --> 04:33:57,494
right?

9806
04:33:58,900 --> 04:34:00,140
You think she's a young one?

9807
04:34:00,170 --> 04:34:00,870
I Dunno.

9808
04:34:00,870 --> 04:34:02,750
Lionesses smaller team,

9809
04:34:02,990 --> 04:34:03,823
but it seems

9810
04:34:05,630 --> 04:34:06,463
silly,

9811
04:34:06,590 --> 04:34:08,360
but it seemed like she wasn't that big.

9812
04:34:08,510 --> 04:34:10,190
Oh my God.

9813
04:34:11,220 --> 04:34:12,260
Oh Shit.

9814
04:34:12,261 --> 04:34:13,340
There's the female son,

9815
04:34:14,050 --> 04:34:14,883
Vegas.

9816
04:34:15,190 --> 04:34:16,610
It's a male Brendan.

9817
04:34:17,480 --> 04:34:20,420
Mgm Back at a hold that that bag.

9818
04:34:20,930 --> 04:34:21,710
You might as well just,

9819
04:34:21,710 --> 04:34:23,460

9820
04:34:24,130 --> 04:34:25,340
so crazy.

9821
04:34:25,520 --> 04:34:26,870
What are they thinking?

9822
04:34:27,400 --> 04:34:28,790
You think they got cocky?

9823
04:34:28,791 --> 04:34:30,200
They thought they could
hang out with their friends.

9824
04:34:30,201 --> 04:34:30,980
Lions.

9825
04:34:30,980 --> 04:34:31,221
Oh,

9826
04:34:31,221 --> 04:34:32,520
this guy's about to get yet.

9827
04:34:34,300 --> 04:34:34,511

9829
04:34:35,210 --> 04:34:36,470
Oh Jesus Christ.

9830
04:34:36,471 --> 04:34:37,700
Don't show me this jam.

9831
04:34:37,701 --> 04:34:39,680
Eat that aren't so I
don't want to see this.

9832
04:34:39,710 --> 04:34:40,543
I do.

9833
04:34:40,840 --> 04:34:43,000
I want to see this guy getting torn up.

9834
04:34:44,470 --> 04:34:45,303
It's just the,

9835
04:34:45,940 --> 04:34:46,773
just a tee shirt.

9836
04:34:46,990 --> 04:34:47,820
It's just like,

9837
04:34:47,820 --> 04:34:48,653
God,

9838
04:34:49,860 --> 04:34:50,500
no,

9839
04:34:50,500 --> 04:34:51,260
this is not good.

9840
04:34:51,260 --> 04:34:51,950
That's fake.

9841
04:34:51,950 --> 04:34:53,510
Oh my God.

9842
04:34:53,600 --> 04:34:54,660
Oh my God.

9843
04:34:54,790 --> 04:34:55,190
Circus.

9844
04:34:55,190 --> 04:34:56,450
The leaving this shit.

9845
04:34:56,900 --> 04:34:57,990
Oh my stride.

9846
04:34:58,480 --> 04:34:58,710
I see.

9847
04:34:58,710 --> 04:34:59,600
I like the real ones.

9848
04:34:59,840 --> 04:35:00,870
I don't like to exhibit once.

9849
04:35:00,890 --> 04:35:02,060
The here's the real shit.

9850
04:35:02,090 --> 04:35:02,923
Is that an ostrich?

9851
04:35:03,520 --> 04:35:05,630
Oh God.

9852
04:35:05,690 --> 04:35:06,351
What is that?

9853
04:35:06,351 --> 04:35:07,270
It tackled it dude.

9854
04:35:07,280 --> 04:35:08,113
And they shot it.

9855
04:35:09,380 --> 04:35:10,370
At least he ran.

9856
04:35:10,850 --> 04:35:11,810
Oh my God.

9857
04:35:11,930 --> 04:35:12,291
Oh yeah,

9858
04:35:12,291 --> 04:35:12,951
red carpet.

9859
04:35:12,951 --> 04:35:13,581
That makes sense.

9860
04:35:13,581 --> 04:35:14,330
You dumb ass.

9861
04:35:14,330 --> 04:35:15,980
Oh Jesus Christ.

9862
04:35:16,040 --> 04:35:17,000
That's not America.

9863
04:35:17,010 --> 04:35:17,843
There's no way.

9864
04:35:18,020 --> 04:35:18,950
Oh my God,

9865
04:35:18,951 --> 04:35:20,240
it's got his fucking leg,

9866
04:35:20,630 --> 04:35:20,991
dude.

9867
04:35:20,991 --> 04:35:22,550
Fuck these things.

9868
04:35:22,551 --> 04:35:23,480
Like what is wrong?

9869
04:35:23,481 --> 04:35:28,030
Why you won't go down a red carpet in a
Tuxedo like an asshole with all lie in a

9870
04:35:28,040 --> 04:35:28,571
lie.

9871
04:35:28,571 --> 04:35:30,260
And who's your date tonight line?

9872
04:35:30,440 --> 04:35:34,850
I'm going to let everyone know
I'm so connected to the wall.

9873
04:35:35,450 --> 04:35:36,620
A real life story.

9874
04:35:36,621 --> 04:35:37,161
Not this,

9875
04:35:37,161 --> 04:35:39,230
but when we were hunting
over there in Tanzania,

9876
04:35:39,530 --> 04:35:42,680
this lioness had cubs and we had
to keep driving by in the jeep.

9877
04:35:42,681 --> 04:35:44,360
We know when we were hunting the lioness,

9878
04:35:44,600 --> 04:35:47,810
but she was getting mad
like every time we drive by.

9879
04:35:48,050 --> 04:35:49,850
So one time we drove by,

9880
04:35:50,030 --> 04:35:52,070
we got video of it
somewhere on my Instagram,

9881
04:35:52,400 --> 04:35:55,890
but she takes off after
the jeep and we're like go,

9882
04:35:55,891 --> 04:35:56,101
go,

9883
04:35:56,101 --> 04:35:57,690
go and we're going,

9884
04:35:57,870 --> 04:36:02,870
dust is coming up and here she comes out
of the dust and catching up with us to

9885
04:36:03,530 --> 04:36:04,310
Linus.

9886
04:36:04,310 --> 04:36:04,720
Yeah.

9887
04:36:04,720 --> 04:36:05,970
Will you in an open cheap?

9888
04:36:06,440 --> 04:36:08,120
Oh No,

9889
04:36:08,480 --> 04:36:10,200
we gotta fucking never buddy.

9890
04:36:10,760 --> 04:36:12,960
We were kind of laughing like ha ha ha.

9891
04:36:13,170 --> 04:36:14,690
And then she comes out of the dope.

9892
04:36:14,860 --> 04:36:15,770
She's like catching,

9893
04:36:16,200 --> 04:36:16,890
but you guys aren't,

9894
04:36:16,890 --> 04:36:17,910
y'all had your guns out.

9895
04:36:17,911 --> 04:36:18,744
Like come on.

9896
04:36:20,020 --> 04:36:22,380
But what if you had
like one bad spark plug,

9897
04:36:22,740 --> 04:36:27,210
like won miss fire engines just hiccup
and once shitty old carburetor they

9898
04:36:27,211 --> 04:36:28,560
haven't cleared the dust out of

9899
04:36:30,400 --> 04:36:30,871
and it just,

9900
04:36:30,871 --> 04:36:33,180
the fuel injectors get fucking clogged.

9901
04:36:33,810 --> 04:36:36,780
Jesus Christ and a giant
cat is eating your asshole

9902
04:36:38,370 --> 04:36:40,030
just in case you have a backup gun.

9903
04:36:40,140 --> 04:36:40,840
No,

9904
04:36:40,840 --> 04:36:42,570
you need to get that shit in order.

9905
04:36:42,590 --> 04:36:43,423
Okay.

9906
04:36:44,480 --> 04:36:47,550
You've got to have that backup gun
hanging out with polar bears and shit.

9907
04:36:48,180 --> 04:36:48,930
Yeah.

9908
04:36:48,930 --> 04:36:49,380
Don't,

9909
04:36:49,380 --> 04:36:50,760
don't hang out with polar bears.

9910
04:36:50,820 --> 04:36:52,980
That does not seem like a wise maneuver.

9911
04:36:53,640 --> 04:36:56,070
Those fucking things don't
do anything but Jack Things.

9912
04:36:56,170 --> 04:36:57,540
He would see that video that I posted.

9913
04:36:57,570 --> 04:36:58,403
Um,

9914
04:36:58,410 --> 04:37:02,850
I forgot where I got it from on the
come and national geographic snow.

9915
04:37:02,920 --> 04:37:06,930
A seal seal's Chelan and doesn't know
that a polar bears in the neighborhood and

9916
04:37:06,931 --> 04:37:10,540
the pope or jumps up on the
ice shelf and the CLCs it was,

9917
04:37:10,630 --> 04:37:11,463
and it goes,

9918
04:37:11,980 --> 04:37:15,930
it starts this mad sprint for
the water and gets to the water.

9919
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:16,950
As he's getting in the water,

9920
04:37:16,951 --> 04:37:20,790
the polar bears coming out of the water
onto the ice shelf and he's running

9921
04:37:20,791 --> 04:37:22,350
towards him and he dives into the water.

9922
04:37:22,351 --> 04:37:23,160
Watch this shit.

9923
04:37:23,160 --> 04:37:23,460
Yeah,

9924
04:37:23,460 --> 04:37:23,970
look,

9925
04:37:23,970 --> 04:37:24,990
but seal is just like,

9926
04:37:24,991 --> 04:37:25,700
you know,

9927
04:37:25,700 --> 04:37:27,570
you know how we do killer whale one?

9928
04:37:27,571 --> 04:37:28,404
They watch this.

9929
04:37:28,600 --> 04:37:28,731
Yeah,

9930
04:37:28,731 --> 04:37:29,101
but hold on.

9931
04:37:29,101 --> 04:37:29,850
Say it.

9932
04:37:29,850 --> 04:37:32,400
Oh look at the polar bear appears up.

9933
04:37:32,940 --> 04:37:33,830
It realizes it's,

9934
04:37:33,840 --> 04:37:34,320
there it goes.

9935
04:37:34,320 --> 04:37:35,520
Oh motherfucker.

9936
04:37:36,120 --> 04:37:36,271
Oh,

9937
04:37:36,271 --> 04:37:37,340
this is just the Gif.

9938
04:37:37,890 --> 04:37:38,161
Oh,

9939
04:37:38,161 --> 04:37:38,994
it's a different one.

9940
04:37:39,750 --> 04:37:39,901
Oh,

9941
04:37:39,901 --> 04:37:41,740
the the Gif on the video.

9942
04:37:41,750 --> 04:37:46,240
It's a gift to those classic
gift to imagine that mean.

9943
04:37:46,800 --> 04:37:47,820
Just see if we can find that.

9944
04:37:48,150 --> 04:37:48,501
Or wait.

9945
04:37:48,501 --> 04:37:49,850
Joe D is called [inaudible].

9946
04:37:49,950 --> 04:37:50,760
This is it.

9947
04:37:50,760 --> 04:37:51,160
There's a,

9948
04:37:51,160 --> 04:37:51,993
there's a seal.

9949
04:37:52,110 --> 04:37:52,411
He's like,

9950
04:37:52,411 --> 04:37:52,651
fuck,

9951
04:37:52,651 --> 04:37:52,831
fuck,

9952
04:37:52,831 --> 04:37:53,041
fuck,

9953
04:37:53,041 --> 04:37:53,251
fuck,

9954
04:37:53,251 --> 04:37:53,940
fuck.

9955
04:37:53,940 --> 04:37:54,620
And the polar bears.

9956
04:37:54,620 --> 04:37:55,590
Oh God.

9957
04:37:55,710 --> 04:37:57,500
See we dived right the fucking,

9958
04:37:57,870 --> 04:37:58,561
well Jamie,

9959
04:37:58,561 --> 04:38:00,720
find the one one posted.

9960
04:38:01,110 --> 04:38:01,943
Go on.

9961
04:38:02,540 --> 04:38:06,390
My Instagram got shit for
water break somewhere.

9962
04:38:06,391 --> 04:38:07,224
My Instagram,

9963
04:38:08,570 --> 04:38:08,940
like,

9964
04:38:08,940 --> 04:38:09,900
it was a while ago though.

9965
04:38:10,080 --> 04:38:10,560
There's,

9966
04:38:10,560 --> 04:38:12,660
there's one similar with,

9967
04:38:12,920 --> 04:38:14,130
with killer whales.

9968
04:38:14,220 --> 04:38:15,570
There's like three of
them and they're like,

9969
04:38:15,571 --> 04:38:16,261
fuck it right in there.

9970
04:38:16,261 --> 04:38:17,900
Teaching them how to make it,

9971
04:38:18,330 --> 04:38:22,020
they're making waves on a
fucking seal this and then they,

9972
04:38:22,021 --> 04:38:23,970
they rock it off and it's done.

9973
04:38:24,030 --> 04:38:24,181
Yeah.

9974
04:38:24,181 --> 04:38:27,990
They put their weight on it and they
tilt it and then make them slide right to

9975
04:38:27,991 --> 04:38:28,500
them.

9976
04:38:28,500 --> 04:38:29,550
These poor fuckers,

9977
04:38:30,100 --> 04:38:31,410
the oldest trick in the book,

9978
04:38:31,650 --> 04:38:32,910
we got on a site shelf.

9979
04:38:33,210 --> 04:38:34,320
Everything should be cool now.

9980
04:38:34,990 --> 04:38:35,823
I was like,

9981
04:38:35,970 --> 04:38:36,803
bitch,

9982
04:38:39,300 --> 04:38:40,133
shit on it.

9983
04:38:42,290 --> 04:38:45,720
Slippery to get away from it.

9984
04:38:45,750 --> 04:38:46,201
Oh yeah.

9985
04:38:46,201 --> 04:38:48,240
That's the seal that runs
away from the sharks.

9986
04:38:48,270 --> 04:38:48,660
Yeah,

9987
04:38:48,660 --> 04:38:48,901
sure.

9988
04:38:48,901 --> 04:38:49,920
Smart Little fuckers.

9989
04:38:49,921 --> 04:38:50,520
Yeah.

9990
04:38:50,520 --> 04:38:53,410
The sharks were trying
to eat the seals and so,

9991
04:38:53,500 --> 04:38:54,370
oh shit,

9992
04:38:54,400 --> 04:38:54,760
was it?

9993
04:38:54,760 --> 04:38:55,451
Sharks are killer.

9994
04:38:55,451 --> 04:38:56,920
Whales trainee says whale.

9995
04:38:57,120 --> 04:38:57,401
Oh,

9996
04:38:57,401 --> 04:38:58,380
so what's killer whale?

9997
04:38:59,640 --> 04:38:59,920
Yeah,

9998
04:38:59,920 --> 04:39:00,741
it's a killer whale.

9999
04:39:00,741 --> 04:39:02,290
A seal didn't care what it got up on.

10000
04:39:02,920 --> 04:39:05,470
It just so happened he will fuck with.

10001
04:39:05,500 --> 04:39:06,760
They will fuck with seals.

10002
04:39:06,761 --> 04:39:08,530
They'll play with them
before they kill him.

10003
04:39:08,740 --> 04:39:09,670
They're so smart.

10004
04:39:09,690 --> 04:39:11,210
It's like there's a shark down there too.

10005
04:39:11,410 --> 04:39:12,640
And you know they're a dolphin.

10006
04:39:13,960 --> 04:39:17,330
What is killer whale or Dolphin cove?

10007
04:39:17,490 --> 04:39:18,820
It's a cousin of a dolphin.

10008
04:39:19,210 --> 04:39:22,030
A whale killer whale is a cousin of Orca.

10009
04:39:22,060 --> 04:39:23,440
All the cousin of a dolphin,

10010
04:39:23,470 --> 04:39:24,040
right?

10011
04:39:24,040 --> 04:39:24,341
Well,

10012
04:39:24,341 --> 04:39:27,250
whales and dolphins are similar
in that the marine mammals,

10013
04:39:27,251 --> 04:39:29,860
but like as far as like this species goes,

10014
04:39:30,250 --> 04:39:33,280
killer orcas apparently
are closer to dolphin.

10015
04:39:33,281 --> 04:39:33,880
I didn't know that.

10016
04:39:33,880 --> 04:39:34,990
They're super close to doff.

10017
04:39:34,991 --> 04:39:36,460
That's why they're both smart as shit.

10018
04:39:36,461 --> 04:39:37,271
Smart Shit.

10019
04:39:37,271 --> 04:39:38,440
But they kill each other.

10020
04:39:39,550 --> 04:39:41,620
Mostly orchids kill dolphins,

10021
04:39:41,740 --> 04:39:42,640
but orchids,

10022
04:39:42,660 --> 04:39:43,130
I think so.

10023
04:39:43,130 --> 04:39:44,860
Killer whales and it can't,

10024
04:39:44,861 --> 04:39:45,491
it can't.

10025
04:39:45,491 --> 04:39:46,510
They kill great whites too,

10026
04:39:46,511 --> 04:39:49,310
like they fucking punks at a great,

10027
04:39:49,320 --> 04:39:49,411
well,

10028
04:39:49,411 --> 04:39:50,530
they've killed great whites.

10029
04:39:50,531 --> 04:39:52,060
There's so much smarter and bigger.

10030
04:39:52,170 --> 04:39:53,410
Where do you see that on Youtube?

10031
04:39:53,590 --> 04:39:56,770
He has a video of a mama
and protecting her house.

10032
04:39:56,860 --> 04:39:58,210
What does time that Youtube works?

10033
04:39:58,211 --> 04:39:58,481
Okay,

10034
04:39:58,481 --> 04:40:00,430
what is a a a baby?

10035
04:40:00,820 --> 04:40:01,653
What do you call a baby?

10036
04:40:02,650 --> 04:40:04,180
A baby or calf.

10037
04:40:04,181 --> 04:40:06,380
Was it a calf calf?

10038
04:40:06,390 --> 04:40:07,223
Barb Guy.

10039
04:40:07,330 --> 04:40:08,170
Isn't that weird?

10040
04:40:08,171 --> 04:40:09,280
Why can't we just call it a baby?

10041
04:40:09,281 --> 04:40:11,650
Why can't admit their
smartest shit is weird.

10042
04:40:11,980 --> 04:40:12,940
But they kill whales.

10043
04:40:12,941 --> 04:40:14,290
Do they bite their faces?

10044
04:40:14,710 --> 04:40:15,640
So it's rough.

10045
04:40:15,700 --> 04:40:16,481
There's one video.

10046
04:40:16,481 --> 04:40:17,314
It really,

10047
04:40:17,410 --> 04:40:18,490
I'd love to see it.

10048
04:40:18,730 --> 04:40:21,850
It's a killer whale killing a
whale and he bites his face.

10049
04:40:21,851 --> 04:40:23,510
Just chewing this whales face off.

10050
04:40:23,760 --> 04:40:24,340
Duct here.

10051
04:40:24,340 --> 04:40:25,910
Wisdom apart motherfucker.

10052
04:40:25,911 --> 04:40:26,744
The Yang is shit.

10053
04:40:26,790 --> 04:40:27,420
I mean Shit,

10054
04:40:27,420 --> 04:40:28,270
because the sham move,

10055
04:40:28,271 --> 04:40:31,710
we grew up thinking they're
all cool and friendly to us.

10056
04:40:32,310 --> 04:40:32,890
A Pencil,

10057
04:40:32,890 --> 04:40:33,880
Tony Montana,

10058
04:40:33,950 --> 04:40:34,780
seaworld.

10059
04:40:34,780 --> 04:40:37,480
But in reality I Pablo Escobar,

10060
04:40:37,660 --> 04:40:39,280
I had read something that wasn't true.

10061
04:40:39,430 --> 04:40:40,660
I read something that wasn't true.

10062
04:40:40,661 --> 04:40:42,940
But as one of those things that
you read and it sounds so awesome,

10063
04:40:42,941 --> 04:40:44,230
you don't want it to not be true.

10064
04:40:44,620 --> 04:40:49,360
But what I read was that killer whales
used to kill people until World War Two

10065
04:40:49,540 --> 04:40:52,450
when they started using
planes and they used,

10066
04:40:52,570 --> 04:40:55,420
do you use killer whales
for Tiger target practice?

10067
04:40:55,510 --> 04:40:56,261
That's some bullshit.

10068
04:40:56,261 --> 04:40:57,280
It's totally bullshit,

10069
04:40:57,281 --> 04:40:59,290
but I heard it and I got so excited.

10070
04:40:59,600 --> 04:41:00,430
Yeah.

10071
04:41:00,430 --> 04:41:02,410
How do you know what the bullshit
you're measuring that Joe.

10072
04:41:02,860 --> 04:41:03,460
Maybe it's real.

10073
04:41:03,460 --> 04:41:04,300
How do you know it's bullshit?

10074
04:41:04,330 --> 04:41:04,481
Well,

10075
04:41:04,481 --> 04:41:08,280
because is because they sent it
on CNN because I'm educated MSN.

10076
04:41:08,480 --> 04:41:10,900
Just cause I'm educated that
there's no way that was.

10077
04:41:10,901 --> 04:41:11,350
No,

10078
04:41:11,350 --> 04:41:14,560
there's no evidence that they ever
killed anybody other than in captivity.

10079
04:41:14,740 --> 04:41:19,150
I'm just saying what they know as far
as evidence of killer whales attacking

10080
04:41:19,151 --> 04:41:19,984
human beings,

10081
04:41:20,710 --> 04:41:24,250
there's almost no record of
anything ever happening in the wild.

10082
04:41:24,280 --> 04:41:25,520
What if they covered that shit up?

10083
04:41:26,140 --> 04:41:27,010
Why would they do that?

10084
04:41:27,011 --> 04:41:27,820
The too busy.

10085
04:41:27,820 --> 04:41:30,340
Because the foundation and sea world,

10086
04:41:30,610 --> 04:41:31,443
they don't have time.

10087
04:41:31,540 --> 04:41:31,901
Is this?

10088
04:41:31,901 --> 04:41:32,260
Yeah.

10089
04:41:32,260 --> 04:41:32,441
See,

10090
04:41:32,441 --> 04:41:36,730
this killer whale is biting his
fucking wheels face off or shark.

10091
04:41:36,731 --> 04:41:37,564
Here.

10092
04:41:37,650 --> 04:41:38,490
There's a tiger shark.

10093
04:41:38,850 --> 04:41:39,683
Tiger Shark.

10094
04:41:40,000 --> 04:41:40,270
It's,

10095
04:41:40,270 --> 04:41:41,590
I think it's a humpback whale.

10096
04:41:42,430 --> 04:41:44,710
They've never killed humans.

10097
04:41:45,040 --> 04:41:45,461
I don't know,

10098
04:41:45,461 --> 04:41:45,790
man.

10099
04:41:45,790 --> 04:41:47,050
It was a movie called Orca.

10100
04:41:47,260 --> 04:41:48,280
Maybe they don't need us.

10101
04:41:48,890 --> 04:41:51,100
Maybe they know that
we're not competing based.

10102
04:41:51,260 --> 04:41:52,093
All right now

10103
04:41:52,130 --> 04:41:52,520
what?

10104
04:41:52,520 --> 04:41:53,770
Anything include hungry.

10105
04:41:53,860 --> 04:41:54,590
I'm starving.

10106
04:41:54,590 --> 04:41:55,770
There's bars.

10107
04:41:55,810 --> 04:41:56,720
Do you know Josh?

10108
04:41:58,610 --> 04:41:59,990
Me At the same though.

10109
04:42:00,370 --> 04:42:01,400
I tried to have one,

10110
04:42:01,460 --> 04:42:03,170
but I got in trouble with great whites.

10111
04:42:03,320 --> 04:42:04,730
There was a movie called Orca.

10112
04:42:04,850 --> 04:42:05,481
I thought you said,

10113
04:42:05,481 --> 04:42:07,700
you know how Josh fucked
fucked everybody else.

10114
04:42:07,701 --> 04:42:08,630
I don't want to Josh,

10115
04:42:09,330 --> 04:42:09,810
Josh,

10116
04:42:09,810 --> 04:42:13,750
Josh Barnett fucked everything is in flux.

10117
04:42:14,600 --> 04:42:15,680
I know jaws

10118
04:42:18,230 --> 04:42:18,790
for sure.

10119
04:42:18,790 --> 04:42:20,360
Go in to guide their
emotion because of jobs.

10120
04:42:20,361 --> 04:42:21,660
I know it's a brainwash,

10121
04:42:21,661 --> 04:42:26,150
but it worked and I'm a subject of it
and I am not going in the goddamn ocean.

10122
04:42:26,180 --> 04:42:28,430
Do you think they're trying to
keep us from the oceans knowledge?

10123
04:42:28,610 --> 04:42:32,530
I don't know why they're trying
to keep us jobs that worked on,

10124
04:42:32,960 --> 04:42:34,320
there's the new jaws caucus.

10125
04:42:34,350 --> 04:42:35,210
The shallows.

10126
04:42:35,800 --> 04:42:37,180
Lively Orca.

10127
04:42:38,290 --> 04:42:40,460
Just like jobs,

10128
04:42:40,461 --> 04:42:41,091
but it was actually,

10129
04:42:41,091 --> 04:42:42,290
it was a killer whale.

10130
04:42:42,400 --> 04:42:42,630
Yeah,

10131
04:42:42,630 --> 04:42:43,131
it was a toe.

10132
04:42:43,131 --> 04:42:46,190
Whether Jack people trying
to see that boy shit,

10133
04:42:47,000 --> 04:42:47,833
that friend,

10134
04:42:50,460 --> 04:42:52,370
somebody not want to go.

10135
04:42:52,550 --> 04:42:53,270
I think you're right.

10136
04:42:53,270 --> 04:42:54,680
I think 79 sounds right.

10137
04:42:55,190 --> 04:42:56,750
Was that the worst movie of all time?

10138
04:42:56,880 --> 04:42:58,630
[inaudible] 77 nice.

10139
04:42:58,631 --> 04:43:00,170
74 jaws.

10140
04:43:00,171 --> 04:43:01,070
Think about that shit.

10141
04:43:01,071 --> 04:43:01,990
Jobs ripped this,

10142
04:43:02,140 --> 04:43:02,973
this was

10143
04:43:05,390 --> 04:43:09,680
what year was two jobs was older
than 70 17% on rotten tomatoes.

10144
04:43:11,330 --> 04:43:12,230
What year was jaws?

10145
04:43:12,260 --> 04:43:12,561
Okay,

10146
04:43:12,561 --> 04:43:14,120
I'm going to say jaws is older than I am.

10147
04:43:14,121 --> 04:43:17,930
Say Jol 70 to 75 this what year?

10148
04:43:17,960 --> 04:43:19,680
75 so it's old.

10149
04:43:19,681 --> 04:43:20,281
It's okay.

10150
04:43:20,281 --> 04:43:21,740
So this was jaws off?

10151
04:43:21,770 --> 04:43:22,100
Yeah,

10152
04:43:22,100 --> 04:43:23,850
I've got a baby whale.

10153
04:43:24,840 --> 04:43:25,590
We all knew that.

10154
04:43:25,590 --> 04:43:28,490
We just forgot because
Peter Benchley wrote jaws.

10155
04:43:28,491 --> 04:43:29,840
Jaws was a hit novel,

10156
04:43:29,841 --> 04:43:30,111
right?

10157
04:43:30,111 --> 04:43:32,090
Wasn't it came from a true story,

10158
04:43:32,300 --> 04:43:32,511
right,

10159
04:43:32,511 --> 04:43:34,040
but wasn't a novel before.

10160
04:43:34,041 --> 04:43:34,620
It was okay.

10161
04:43:34,620 --> 04:43:35,420
Got suppressed.

10162
04:43:35,420 --> 04:43:36,171
I read the book.

10163
04:43:36,171 --> 04:43:37,010
I know I read the book was,

10164
04:43:37,011 --> 04:43:40,520
it was one of those times they used to
make books and they would sell them and

10165
04:43:40,521 --> 04:43:41,810
it was the plot of the movie.

10166
04:43:41,840 --> 04:43:42,441
Peter Benchley.

10167
04:43:42,441 --> 04:43:43,430
They still do that,

10168
04:43:44,510 --> 04:43:45,231
but this wasn't that.

10169
04:43:45,231 --> 04:43:45,950
It was a novel.

10170
04:43:45,950 --> 04:43:46,221
Okay.

10171
04:43:46,221 --> 04:43:49,490
1974 novel and then they
turned it into moving 70 shark.

10172
04:43:49,491 --> 04:43:49,671
Right.

10173
04:43:49,671 --> 04:43:50,504
That's the most

10174
04:43:52,600 --> 04:43:53,630
it with that movie,

10175
04:43:53,631 --> 04:43:56,150
shallow with Blake lively and it's legit.

10176
04:43:56,600 --> 04:43:58,810
See that picture posted.

10177
04:43:59,180 --> 04:44:00,860
The picture picture I
posted on my Instagram.

10178
04:44:00,861 --> 04:44:02,000
That wasn't a real shark.

10179
04:44:02,001 --> 04:44:03,290
It was a three d rendering,

10180
04:44:03,291 --> 04:44:04,660
like a computer renders.

10181
04:44:04,820 --> 04:44:06,060
But did you want a shirt?

10182
04:44:06,080 --> 04:44:06,390
It looks like.

10183
04:44:06,390 --> 04:44:06,501
Yeah,

10184
04:44:06,501 --> 04:44:07,070
yeah,

10185
04:44:07,070 --> 04:44:07,320
yeah.

10186
04:44:07,320 --> 04:44:07,640
It's,

10187
04:44:07,640 --> 04:44:08,361
I repost it.

10188
04:44:08,361 --> 04:44:09,320
It was from somewhere else,

10189
04:44:09,321 --> 04:44:11,840
but it's fucking crazy.

10190
04:44:12,050 --> 04:44:12,651
Here's the thing,

10191
04:44:12,651 --> 04:44:13,040
man.

10192
04:44:13,040 --> 04:44:13,341
Yeah,

10193
04:44:13,341 --> 04:44:14,300
it's a three d rendering.

10194
04:44:14,330 --> 04:44:15,920
But that's what a shark looks like.

10195
04:44:15,950 --> 04:44:17,210
And the sharks can do that.

10196
04:44:17,510 --> 04:44:17,751
Yes.

10197
04:44:17,751 --> 04:44:18,800
They can see the south,

10198
04:44:18,801 --> 04:44:20,030
that water.

10199
04:44:20,180 --> 04:44:20,991
That's all real.

10200
04:44:20,991 --> 04:44:21,710
I mean,

10201
04:44:21,710 --> 04:44:22,341
that's totally,

10202
04:44:22,341 --> 04:44:23,174
keep it up.

10203
04:44:24,570 --> 04:44:25,610
You're fired.

10204
04:44:25,790 --> 04:44:26,510
How dare you.

10205
04:44:26,510 --> 04:44:27,500
You just went crazy.

10206
04:44:28,340 --> 04:44:29,173
He's lost it.

10207
04:44:29,540 --> 04:44:31,190
How dare you look at that thing,

10208
04:44:31,191 --> 04:44:31,820
man.

10209
04:44:31,820 --> 04:44:32,270
I mean,

10210
04:44:32,270 --> 04:44:34,160
if that wasn't a real animal,

10211
04:44:34,520 --> 04:44:34,910
if that,

10212
04:44:34,910 --> 04:44:36,590
if there was no such thing as a shark,

10213
04:44:36,600 --> 04:44:37,433
that's your,

10214
04:44:38,610 --> 04:44:39,020
uh,

10215
04:44:39,020 --> 04:44:39,261
yeah,

10216
04:44:39,261 --> 04:44:40,094
you're right.

10217
04:44:40,400 --> 04:44:41,233
Five likes.

10218
04:44:41,270 --> 04:44:41,720
You're right.

10219
04:44:41,720 --> 04:44:42,710
That's the most likes ever.

10220
04:44:42,740 --> 04:44:43,970
We try to figure out which one it was.

10221
04:44:44,320 --> 04:44:46,640
[inaudible] 75 no,

10222
04:44:48,620 --> 04:44:50,100
that's not much in the rock

10223
04:44:50,100 --> 04:44:50,940
gets that shit.

10224
04:44:53,100 --> 04:44:53,790
Yeah,

10225
04:44:53,790 --> 04:44:54,300
I'm sure.

10226
04:44:54,300 --> 04:44:56,340
But look at the fucking
body on that thing.

10227
04:44:56,341 --> 04:44:57,174
That's a real,

10228
04:44:57,860 --> 04:44:59,430
but that's the really what they're built.

10229
04:44:59,431 --> 04:45:04,080
Like they're a giant mouth with a body
that had just fill up with member of

10230
04:45:04,081 --> 04:45:04,471
jaws.

10231
04:45:04,471 --> 04:45:07,170
They were like pulling license
plates out and boots and shit.

10232
04:45:07,230 --> 04:45:07,971
I love sharks.

10233
04:45:07,971 --> 04:45:08,340
Sharks.

10234
04:45:08,340 --> 04:45:09,330
I wanted a shark tooth.

10235
04:45:09,390 --> 04:45:11,220
I had shark tooth necklace,

10236
04:45:11,560 --> 04:45:12,300
too many have that.

10237
04:45:12,300 --> 04:45:13,051
I did too,

10238
04:45:13,051 --> 04:45:13,410
man.

10239
04:45:13,410 --> 04:45:15,690
How about another mother fuckers?

10240
04:45:16,330 --> 04:45:18,120
Crazy bull sharks.

10241
04:45:18,200 --> 04:45:19,000
Tiger sharks.

10242
04:45:19,000 --> 04:45:23,340
She said there's great whites all all in
hit down here from fucking San Diego up

10243
04:45:23,341 --> 04:45:25,590
to do you know the jaws was based on a,

10244
04:45:25,600 --> 04:45:27,770
an attack that took place in fresh water?

10245
04:45:27,810 --> 04:45:28,590
Yes.

10246
04:45:28,590 --> 04:45:29,051
Yeah.

10247
04:45:29,051 --> 04:45:31,110
All the New Jersey coast.

10248
04:45:31,160 --> 04:45:31,320
Yeah.

10249
04:45:31,320 --> 04:45:32,153
It was a true story.

10250
04:45:32,520 --> 04:45:33,353
Sort of.

10251
04:45:33,480 --> 04:45:36,270
Nobody wants to admit that the
sharks were killing people,

10252
04:45:36,271 --> 04:45:37,290
but it wasn't a great white.

10253
04:45:37,490 --> 04:45:38,490
It was bull sharks.

10254
04:45:38,780 --> 04:45:39,613
They were bull sharks.

10255
04:45:40,890 --> 04:45:41,121
Dude.

10256
04:45:41,121 --> 04:45:42,210
Bull sharks are so crazy.

10257
04:45:42,211 --> 04:45:45,240
They can get all the way up the
Mississippi River towards Illinois.

10258
04:45:45,810 --> 04:45:50,060
They can go that high up fresh water
because there's a bunch of bull sharks and

10259
04:45:50,100 --> 04:45:50,731
tiger sharks.

10260
04:45:50,731 --> 04:45:51,564
Those are the super,

10261
04:45:52,140 --> 04:45:52,980
super aggressive.

10262
04:45:53,130 --> 04:45:57,030
When you hear about people getting bit
and those are jackhammers making videos

10263
04:45:57,031 --> 04:45:57,970
with got a swimming with you.

10264
04:45:57,980 --> 04:45:59,070
Those guys are crazy.

10265
04:45:59,100 --> 04:46:01,650
What about that was swimming with sharks.

10266
04:46:01,890 --> 04:46:02,920
We get that one garages,

10267
04:46:03,200 --> 04:46:04,510
he breaches the watch.

10268
04:46:05,150 --> 04:46:05,750
Do you see that?

10269
04:46:05,750 --> 04:46:07,740
Did you see that surfer
in the competition?

10270
04:46:08,150 --> 04:46:09,540
You see the surface of the competition,

10271
04:46:09,541 --> 04:46:11,200
there's a bit of white and
you had to fight him off.

10272
04:46:11,230 --> 04:46:11,520
Yeah,

10273
04:46:11,520 --> 04:46:12,353
it bumps him.

10274
04:46:12,720 --> 04:46:13,950
Fuck all that.

10275
04:46:13,980 --> 04:46:15,810
We get bit like the next year to,

10276
04:46:15,840 --> 04:46:16,651
Oh my God.

10277
04:46:16,651 --> 04:46:17,880
Is it delicious man?

10278
04:46:18,240 --> 04:46:19,980
I mean that things flying through the air.

10279
04:46:21,500 --> 04:46:21,960
Yep.

10280
04:46:21,960 --> 04:46:22,793
Don't say it.

10281
04:46:25,910 --> 04:46:27,020
I was to say

10282
04:46:29,900 --> 04:46:33,480
and in living color on it was a female.

10283
04:46:40,380 --> 04:46:41,970
They every year,

10284
04:46:41,971 --> 04:46:44,250
you know every year someone,

10285
04:46:44,430 --> 04:46:45,810
someone in the California coast,

10286
04:46:45,811 --> 04:46:46,644
it's not a lot,

10287
04:46:46,740 --> 04:46:50,580
but almost every year someone
gets bitten in half and there's a,

10288
04:46:51,120 --> 04:46:54,600
I shouldn't say almost every year like
gangster three times that I have known of

10289
04:46:54,780 --> 04:46:56,310
over the past like 10 years,

10290
04:46:56,490 --> 04:47:00,570
guys have been bitten in half and the
scariest one for me was this dude who was

10291
04:47:00,571 --> 04:47:01,091
compete.

10292
04:47:01,091 --> 04:47:05,400
He was training for a triathlon and so
they had hopped in the ocean off the

10293
04:47:05,401 --> 04:47:06,720
coast to San Diego,

10294
04:47:07,200 --> 04:47:08,370
just about a hundred miles,

10295
04:47:08,490 --> 04:47:12,420
a hundred yards off shore and they were
doing these labs and there was a bunch

10296
04:47:12,421 --> 04:47:12,930
of them.

10297
04:47:12,930 --> 04:47:15,150
There's a bunch of people
in the water and it's great.

10298
04:47:15,151 --> 04:47:20,100
White came along and cut one of them in
half in front of everybody could chew

10299
04:47:20,190 --> 04:47:22,030
Iem Chair.

10300
04:47:23,730 --> 04:47:24,563
She would get

10301
04:47:25,940 --> 04:47:26,850
you starting to think like,

10302
04:47:26,851 --> 04:47:31,320
why the fuck exactly am I
doing this in front of you?

10303
04:47:31,321 --> 04:47:36,321
The guy in front of you see in Gulf by
an airstream trailer with teeth and it

10304
04:47:37,381 --> 04:47:42,330
just cuts him in half and his legs go
one way and it's upper body becomes this

10305
04:47:42,480 --> 04:47:47,480
meat stew just fucking trailing off and
the frothy waters in front of you got to

10306
04:47:48,310 --> 04:47:52,720
swim through that shit to get
to the shore and not even that.

10307
04:47:52,721 --> 04:47:54,790
Have you been in the water and
just something to hit your leg?

10308
04:47:55,480 --> 04:47:56,320
Even seaweed.

10309
04:47:56,321 --> 04:47:57,154
I'm like,

10310
04:47:58,580 --> 04:47:59,890
yes.

10311
04:48:00,270 --> 04:48:01,380
Oh my God,

10312
04:48:01,530 --> 04:48:01,900
folks,

10313
04:48:01,900 --> 04:48:02,681
wagon door,

10314
04:48:02,681 --> 04:48:04,930
just closing on your part of the game.

10315
04:48:04,931 --> 04:48:07,750
Fuck all those guys that go out there,

10316
04:48:07,751 --> 04:48:11,450
they know that it's real and they'll
tell you it's part of the Goddamn game.

10317
04:48:11,480 --> 04:48:14,380
It's all the chances are for sure.

10318
04:48:14,381 --> 04:48:16,720
Don't play that can Pacific Ocean,

10319
04:48:17,020 --> 04:48:18,340
California coast.

10320
04:48:18,640 --> 04:48:19,301
That's great.

10321
04:48:19,301 --> 04:48:19,960
White City.

10322
04:48:19,960 --> 04:48:24,960
It's not like South Africa tech though
because it's basically that whole like

10323
04:48:26,620 --> 04:48:28,750
South Africa Ocean does is uh,

10324
04:48:28,960 --> 04:48:30,430
a Jacuzzi for great white.

10325
04:48:30,460 --> 04:48:31,480
You can't go into water there,

10326
04:48:31,600 --> 04:48:32,890
but on the,

10327
04:48:33,250 --> 04:48:34,660
on the California coast,

10328
04:48:34,960 --> 04:48:35,980
that's great white city,

10329
04:48:36,030 --> 04:48:37,050
but no one's going to attack the

10330
04:48:38,830 --> 04:48:39,351
Florida.

10331
04:48:39,351 --> 04:48:41,320
Florida's where there's like the sharks,

10332
04:48:41,321 --> 04:48:42,180
tiger sharks,

10333
04:48:42,280 --> 04:48:43,001
the black tips.

10334
04:48:43,001 --> 04:48:46,140
That's where everyone's
going to tie in great whites.

10335
04:48:46,840 --> 04:48:49,300
Why do you think great whites
aren't attacking people around here,

10336
04:48:49,420 --> 04:48:52,150
but they're tracking people
at crazy in like South Africa?

10337
04:48:52,360 --> 04:48:52,541
Well,

10338
04:48:52,541 --> 04:48:55,620
they attack people in and the co two,

10339
04:48:55,940 --> 04:48:56,860
but it's not that often.

10340
04:48:56,861 --> 04:48:57,381
Not really.

10341
04:48:57,381 --> 04:48:58,214
It's not that often.

10342
04:48:58,300 --> 04:49:01,000
There hasn't been a death in one of
the things they'd been finding out when

10343
04:49:01,001 --> 04:49:02,260
they've been doing all these studies,

10344
04:49:02,261 --> 04:49:05,560
especially they fly over them
with cameras and they look down,

10345
04:49:05,561 --> 04:49:06,880
they're finding great whites,

10346
04:49:07,090 --> 04:49:08,440
a hundred yards off shore.

10347
04:49:08,540 --> 04:49:09,610
Finding babies.

10348
04:49:09,670 --> 04:49:09,860
Yeah.

10349
04:49:09,860 --> 04:49:11,130
They're finding the young ones here.

10350
04:49:12,330 --> 04:49:13,000
Let's go.

10351
04:49:13,000 --> 04:49:13,510
Right.

10352
04:49:13,510 --> 04:49:15,040
They breed in San Francisco,

10353
04:49:15,250 --> 04:49:19,540
they'll have a pop popular beats where
all these mother fucking tours that in

10354
04:49:19,541 --> 04:49:24,541
the beach and like maybe a mile off the
coast that they're monitoring all these

10355
04:49:25,271 --> 04:49:26,021
great whites.

10356
04:49:26,021 --> 04:49:26,980
I just looking at them,

10357
04:49:27,100 --> 04:49:31,630
they're in helicopters that are in plants
and the adolescents are kind of close.

10358
04:49:31,870 --> 04:49:33,070
But they know that those,

10359
04:49:33,250 --> 04:49:35,110
those little teenagers
don't attack humans.

10360
04:49:35,110 --> 04:49:38,590
I know that their people are in the water.

10361
04:49:38,770 --> 04:49:41,500
While there is some task force,

10362
04:49:41,501 --> 04:49:46,501
some great white shark task
force monitoring the great
whites to make sure they

10363
04:49:47,921 --> 04:49:49,360
don't get that close.

10364
04:49:49,660 --> 04:49:52,270
That's every day in South Africa.

10365
04:49:52,450 --> 04:49:54,520
They're there and they could spot them.

10366
04:49:54,521 --> 04:49:56,220
They could see him
cause the water's clear.

10367
04:49:56,230 --> 04:49:56,710
What do they do?

10368
04:49:56,710 --> 04:49:57,850
And if they get too close,

10369
04:49:58,000 --> 04:49:58,710
they're like,

10370
04:49:58,710 --> 04:50:00,450
ah,

10371
04:50:01,850 --> 04:50:05,480
get the fuck mouth.

10372
04:50:06,760 --> 04:50:09,790
Why don't they put up like a net that
anything would kill all the animals?

10373
04:50:09,810 --> 04:50:09,971
Oh,

10374
04:50:09,971 --> 04:50:13,660
anything smaller than like a fucking
tuna can get through to them.

10375
04:50:13,730 --> 04:50:16,190
The dolphins and stuff get
caught in those measures here.

10376
04:50:16,220 --> 04:50:16,500
Right.

10377
04:50:16,500 --> 04:50:17,350
I'm an asshole.

10378
04:50:18,520 --> 04:50:21,270
But I was thinking there's gotta
be a way to like put up something.

10379
04:50:21,280 --> 04:50:25,180
They can walk on the
discovery channel they had,

10380
04:50:25,181 --> 04:50:26,890
they had this guy put up like these,

10381
04:50:26,950 --> 04:50:28,400
these poles at the bottom.

10382
04:50:28,401 --> 04:50:33,401
The CLCs can be a beast to do have these
poles and it would send off like just

10383
04:50:34,350 --> 04:50:36,140
fucking pussy that CNN,

10384
04:50:37,680 --> 04:50:38,351
Fox News,

10385
04:50:38,351 --> 04:50:38,790
Bro.

10386
04:50:38,790 --> 04:50:39,000
Yeah,

10387
04:50:39,000 --> 04:50:39,833
exactly.

10388
04:50:40,030 --> 04:50:40,863
Fuck.

10389
04:50:40,890 --> 04:50:43,270
Do you know Fox News is
pro shark and you know,

10390
04:50:44,820 --> 04:50:46,030
I think it's cheaper if they

10391
04:50:46,050 --> 04:50:46,251
like,

10392
04:50:46,251 --> 04:50:46,940
okay.

10393
04:50:46,940 --> 04:50:49,210
We on the bill and Goddamn fucking fences.

10394
04:50:49,310 --> 04:50:51,590
I don't think that it's not an
issue to keep an eye on that.

10395
04:50:51,620 --> 04:50:51,741
No,

10396
04:50:51,741 --> 04:50:52,590
they don't give a fuck.

10397
04:50:52,670 --> 04:50:53,560
They want the seals.

10398
04:50:53,561 --> 04:50:54,500
They're like one person.

10399
04:50:56,570 --> 04:50:57,403
Obama,

10400
04:50:57,800 --> 04:50:58,633
Obama.

10401
04:50:59,720 --> 04:51:01,010
Donald Trump to,

10402
04:51:01,490 --> 04:51:01,791
you know what?

10403
04:51:01,791 --> 04:51:02,950
I blame uh,

10404
04:51:03,350 --> 04:51:05,970
pharmacy companies random on power seven.

10405
04:51:06,550 --> 04:51:07,240
I know.

10406
04:51:07,240 --> 04:51:09,320
I blame Castro.

10407
04:51:09,500 --> 04:51:09,771
Hey,

10408
04:51:09,771 --> 04:51:11,090
what are you feelings on aliens,

10409
04:51:11,091 --> 04:51:11,770
man.

10410
04:51:11,770 --> 04:51:13,910
I don't even think about aliens no more,

10411
04:51:13,911 --> 04:51:14,210
Dude.

10412
04:51:14,210 --> 04:51:15,043
Aliens are like,

10413
04:51:15,200 --> 04:51:16,650
I look at aliens sounds though.

10414
04:51:16,680 --> 04:51:17,660
You don't believe in aliens.

10415
04:51:17,720 --> 04:51:20,690
I believe that all that Shit
is government distraction.

10416
04:51:20,720 --> 04:51:21,440
Aliens.

10417
04:51:21,440 --> 04:51:22,440
I believe try.

10418
04:51:22,730 --> 04:51:24,830
I've been tricked when I was
into aliens and all that Shit.

10419
04:51:25,010 --> 04:51:26,330
I believed I was hoodwinked.

10420
04:51:26,510 --> 04:51:27,580
I believe that was foolish.

10421
04:51:28,040 --> 04:51:33,040
I believe that all the alien shit is
all bullshit to trick people and they

10422
04:51:33,081 --> 04:51:35,300
tricked me and they trick me no more.

10423
04:51:35,330 --> 04:51:38,720
Do you think like 10 or going the reo
Speedwagon song 10 years down the road,

10424
04:51:38,721 --> 04:51:40,490
you're going to think our,

10425
04:51:41,850 --> 04:51:43,140
the tower seven thing,

10426
04:51:43,570 --> 04:51:44,403
it was a trick.

10427
04:51:45,530 --> 04:51:48,410
And then Trican means get out of here.

10428
04:51:48,870 --> 04:51:50,840
You know what I think for sure.

10429
04:51:50,920 --> 04:51:51,970
We're gonna wrap this up soon,

10430
04:51:52,750 --> 04:51:53,081
but,

10431
04:51:53,081 --> 04:51:53,650
uh,

10432
04:51:53,650 --> 04:51:55,240
I think there's

10433
04:51:55,570 --> 04:51:57,470
so really needs,

10434
04:51:57,510 --> 04:51:58,050
bro.

10435
04:51:58,050 --> 04:51:59,430
There's so little evidence

10436
04:51:59,470 --> 04:52:00,970
that anybody's ever visited us.

10437
04:52:01,000 --> 04:52:01,833
It's in [inaudible].

10438
04:52:01,930 --> 04:52:03,430
This is a crazy thought,

10439
04:52:03,520 --> 04:52:04,390
but think about it.

10440
04:52:04,840 --> 04:52:06,730
If there has to be a point,

10441
04:52:06,760 --> 04:52:07,121
if they're,

10442
04:52:07,121 --> 04:52:12,121
if the earth was at one time this thing
that had no life and it evolved to be

10443
04:52:12,521 --> 04:52:13,510
the thing that's like,

10444
04:52:13,540 --> 04:52:14,171
today we're,

10445
04:52:14,171 --> 04:52:15,790
we're on the Internet and we're driving,

10446
04:52:15,791 --> 04:52:16,780
cars were flying,

10447
04:52:16,781 --> 04:52:18,910
planes were sending
video through this guy.

10448
04:52:19,540 --> 04:52:22,360
It's entirely possible that were
the first things to do this.

10449
04:52:23,110 --> 04:52:26,830
Even though we'd like to
thank the university around
for so long that for sure

10450
04:52:26,831 --> 04:52:29,890
there's ever other civilizations
out there in this infinite universe.

10451
04:52:30,400 --> 04:52:31,233
Maybe

10452
04:52:34,590 --> 04:52:36,570
Brunette fucking mix slap,

10453
04:52:36,650 --> 04:52:37,150
maybe.

10454
04:52:37,150 --> 04:52:37,670
No,

10455
04:52:37,670 --> 04:52:38,140
he doesn't.

10456
04:52:38,140 --> 04:52:38,500
He doesn't

10457
04:52:38,500 --> 04:52:42,310
necessarily know whether or not there's
alien life in other planets and there

10458
04:52:42,311 --> 04:52:43,144
might be.

10459
04:52:43,270 --> 04:52:45,220
But here's the thing about infinity.

10460
04:52:45,730 --> 04:52:50,730
The reality is if we are the first ever
intelligent life and we're the first

10461
04:52:52,061 --> 04:52:53,320
things to ever hit this point,

10462
04:52:53,321 --> 04:52:54,060
would they be,

10463
04:52:54,060 --> 04:52:54,881
if we don't know,

10464
04:52:54,881 --> 04:52:55,181
we don't.

10465
04:52:55,181 --> 04:52:56,830
We never experienced
anything smarter than us.

10466
04:52:56,860 --> 04:52:58,120
Not to say that we're so awesome,

10467
04:52:58,121 --> 04:53:01,390
but we haven't run into any other
intelligent life anywhere in the universe.

10468
04:53:01,391 --> 04:53:02,110
Right?

10469
04:53:02,110 --> 04:53:06,700
It's possible they say that not only is
this the first time that this has ever

10470
04:53:06,701 --> 04:53:07,510
happened,

10471
04:53:07,510 --> 04:53:12,510
but this is happening simultaneously in
infinite worlds that behave exactly the

10472
04:53:14,741 --> 04:53:16,120
same way as this world,

10473
04:53:16,300 --> 04:53:19,990
an infinite universes that every
fucking thing that's ever happened,

10474
04:53:19,991 --> 04:53:21,130
including our El Con,

10475
04:53:21,310 --> 04:53:23,680
including this crazy tower seven talk,

10476
04:53:23,681 --> 04:53:25,450
including is fucking incredible,

10477
04:53:26,170 --> 04:53:30,790
incredible fight between Bisbing and
Henderson is happening to the exact same

10478
04:53:31,050 --> 04:53:34,150
nanosecond in an infinite
number of worlds,

10479
04:53:34,151 --> 04:53:36,000
in an infinite number of times zone.

10480
04:53:36,610 --> 04:53:36,980
But,

10481
04:53:36,980 --> 04:53:40,390
but there's no evidence that we're here
other than the fact that we know we're

10482
04:53:40,391 --> 04:53:41,050
here.

10483
04:53:41,050 --> 04:53:41,920
How do we not,

10484
04:53:41,950 --> 04:53:42,401
how do we,

10485
04:53:42,401 --> 04:53:44,190
not that this is

10486
04:53:44,190 --> 04:53:46,290
probably not just common,

10487
04:53:46,440 --> 04:53:48,330
but constant all throughout the sky.

10488
04:53:48,360 --> 04:53:49,470
How about how about one thing,

10489
04:53:49,471 --> 04:53:49,830
here's an,

10490
04:53:49,830 --> 04:53:51,510
here's a new thing that
I never thought about.

10491
04:53:51,511 --> 04:53:52,860
What the whole moon hoax,

10492
04:53:53,070 --> 04:53:53,760
very,

10493
04:53:53,760 --> 04:53:57,150
there is no video of a video.

10494
04:53:57,151 --> 04:54:01,920
There's all this video of dudes on the
moon with a fucking moon buggy that

10495
04:54:02,580 --> 04:54:03,060
listen up,

10496
04:54:03,060 --> 04:54:03,780
listen on,

10497
04:54:03,780 --> 04:54:06,750
but there's no video footage of,

10498
04:54:07,200 --> 04:54:07,380
you know,

10499
04:54:07,380 --> 04:54:08,520
video footage of boom,

10500
04:54:08,521 --> 04:54:09,480
here's an astronaut,

10501
04:54:09,600 --> 04:54:11,850
here's the earth and here's an Astra,

10502
04:54:11,940 --> 04:54:12,690
here's earth.

10503
04:54:12,690 --> 04:54:17,690
They went up how many times and there's
not one swooping shot of the earth and

10504
04:54:18,721 --> 04:54:21,630
the astronauts and the earth
and the shitty cameramen

10505
04:54:24,920 --> 04:54:27,600
to take pictures of anything
back then was pretty crude.

10506
04:54:27,601 --> 04:54:32,601
All they needed was then they really
think they released those pictures on the

10507
04:54:33,511 --> 04:54:35,040
NASA website,

10508
04:54:35,280 --> 04:54:40,280
proven fake Russian birth from
moon that she was proven fake.

10509
04:54:41,430 --> 04:54:42,990
There's like two different
ones they released.

10510
04:54:43,050 --> 04:54:44,040
That's bullshit,

10511
04:54:44,280 --> 04:54:45,660
but it's all perfect.

10512
04:54:45,840 --> 04:54:48,750
The picture of the earth is
all perfect from the moon,

10513
04:54:48,930 --> 04:54:51,210
but then you couldn't
get no goddamn video.

10514
04:54:51,360 --> 04:54:54,300
All those hours of video on the moon.

10515
04:54:54,390 --> 04:54:57,060
You couldn't swoop up
to the Goddamn Earth.

10516
04:54:57,180 --> 04:54:59,040
You couldn't get any go camera,

10517
04:54:59,050 --> 04:55:02,640
no video of the earth from moon.

10518
04:55:02,760 --> 04:55:03,331
And we went,

10519
04:55:03,331 --> 04:55:04,860
how many mother fucking times.

10520
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:06,500
How many motherfucker done?

10521
04:55:06,520 --> 04:55:07,750
Six Times successful?

10522
04:55:07,790 --> 04:55:09,510
There's no video.

10523
04:55:11,920 --> 04:55:13,620
They've got pictures
that were proven fake.

10524
04:55:13,710 --> 04:55:15,110
Why are they faking picture?

10525
04:55:15,860 --> 04:55:17,160
Why they taking pictures?

10526
04:55:17,890 --> 04:55:18,723
China,

10527
04:55:19,290 --> 04:55:21,060
Jamie's already looking
into it and he knows.

10528
04:55:21,380 --> 04:55:22,260
He knows that's real.

10529
04:55:22,860 --> 04:55:23,693
There's no video.

10530
04:55:23,840 --> 04:55:26,700
Here's one thing from the moon.

10531
04:55:26,760 --> 04:55:29,310
One thing they absolutely
did fake is Michael Collins.

10532
04:55:29,311 --> 04:55:30,000
Somebody did it.

10533
04:55:30,000 --> 04:55:30,660
We don't know who.

10534
04:55:30,660 --> 04:55:31,440
Here's the problem.

10535
04:55:31,440 --> 04:55:31,681
You know,

10536
04:55:31,681 --> 04:55:33,900
it could have been an
overzealous PR representative,

10537
04:55:34,110 --> 04:55:35,710
but Michael Collins from uh,

10538
04:55:35,790 --> 04:55:37,080
one of the Gemini missions,

10539
04:55:37,290 --> 04:55:41,040
there's a photo of him where they blacked
out the background and pretended that

10540
04:55:41,041 --> 04:55:42,540
it was a photo that was taken in space,

10541
04:55:42,720 --> 04:55:43,980
but it's an identical photo.

10542
04:55:43,981 --> 04:55:47,880
Just reversed of how about
that with him in a training?

10543
04:55:48,230 --> 04:55:48,510
Uh,

10544
04:55:48,510 --> 04:55:50,430
he was in a training program,

10545
04:55:50,490 --> 04:55:54,020
so he's hooked up a harness and the
whole deal and wires in the background,

10546
04:55:54,021 --> 04:55:54,930
it's all over her.

10547
04:55:54,931 --> 04:55:55,111
Look,

10548
04:55:55,111 --> 04:55:55,681
you could see it.

10549
04:55:55,681 --> 04:55:56,514
I mean this is,

10550
04:55:56,550 --> 04:55:57,630
but here's the thing,

10551
04:55:57,750 --> 04:55:59,310
and this is just me trying to be fair.

10552
04:55:59,490 --> 04:56:01,020
Who the fuck knows who did that?

10553
04:56:01,230 --> 04:56:04,620
It could have been some idiot who thought
he was smarter than everybody and he

10554
04:56:04,621 --> 04:56:07,900
worked for the Pr Department of NASA
and they didn't have any good photos.

10555
04:56:07,901 --> 04:56:08,491
And look,

10556
04:56:08,491 --> 04:56:09,031
here's the thing,

10557
04:56:09,031 --> 04:56:09,600
man.

10558
04:56:09,600 --> 04:56:13,680
It ain't easy to fucking take
photos while you're in a space walk.

10559
04:56:13,980 --> 04:56:14,341
You know?

10560
04:56:14,341 --> 04:56:16,770
And if a dude is really out
there doing a space walk,

10561
04:56:17,310 --> 04:56:22,310
I think it's entirely possible that
they could lie and fake photos and twist

10562
04:56:22,951 --> 04:56:23,784
stuff around.

10563
04:56:23,940 --> 04:56:24,301
I mean,

10564
04:56:24,301 --> 04:56:28,590
this is the 1960s taking kind of do
whatever the fuck they want it to,

10565
04:56:28,770 --> 04:56:29,760
but you'd never seen this before.

10566
04:56:29,761 --> 04:56:30,594
I want you to see this.

10567
04:56:30,630 --> 04:56:31,463
I want to see it.

10568
04:56:31,530 --> 04:56:32,363
Cheesy habit.

10569
04:56:32,630 --> 04:56:34,170
Show it to Michael Collins.

10570
04:56:34,380 --> 04:56:35,213
Um,

10571
04:56:35,260 --> 04:56:37,350
spacewalk Gemini fake.

10572
04:56:37,980 --> 04:56:38,161
Yeah,

10573
04:56:38,161 --> 04:56:38,351
it's,

10574
04:56:38,351 --> 04:56:39,184
it's weird.

10575
04:56:39,270 --> 04:56:39,601
It's weird.

10576
04:56:39,601 --> 04:56:40,260
But see,

10577
04:56:40,260 --> 04:56:42,160
the thing is I try to be open minded.

10578
04:56:42,160 --> 04:56:43,540
I don't know who did that.

10579
04:56:43,690 --> 04:56:44,920
I don't know when they did that.

10580
04:56:44,950 --> 04:56:46,300
I don't know why they did that.

10581
04:56:46,301 --> 04:56:49,450
I don't know if it'll put them in
one goofy fuck who worked at NASA.

10582
04:56:49,451 --> 04:56:52,360
He thought he was really smart and
he was in charge of the prs it all.

10583
04:56:52,361 --> 04:56:53,590
We've got some great photos,

10584
04:56:53,591 --> 04:56:54,231
Mr President,

10585
04:56:54,231 --> 04:56:55,064
and here's one of them.

10586
04:56:55,120 --> 04:56:56,920
That's no Michael Collins,

10587
04:56:57,010 --> 04:56:57,850
Gemini,

10588
04:56:57,880 --> 04:57:01,620
spacewalk fake photo Jim and I 15 right,

10589
04:57:02,260 --> 04:57:03,280
so fake.

10590
04:57:03,281 --> 04:57:05,350
And then putting that on NASA's website.

10591
04:57:05,590 --> 04:57:10,590
They're putting theories there is just
had a good look at this pictures and

10592
04:57:10,930 --> 04:57:11,763
that's it.

10593
04:57:12,070 --> 04:57:14,560
They can't get one in
Mohegan showed the contrast.

10594
04:57:14,561 --> 04:57:14,801
Okay,

10595
04:57:14,801 --> 04:57:15,221
here it goes.

10596
04:57:15,221 --> 04:57:19,690
So go see the one on the
left is him in a simulation.

10597
04:57:20,200 --> 04:57:23,230
The one on the right is just
the reverse of that image.

10598
04:57:23,290 --> 04:57:24,100
Exactly.

10599
04:57:24,100 --> 04:57:25,300
And it's him in space.

10600
04:57:25,480 --> 04:57:26,261
Of course.

10601
04:57:26,261 --> 04:57:26,860
Yeah.

10602
04:57:26,860 --> 04:57:28,080
So what they did was,

10603
04:57:28,790 --> 04:57:29,170
was like,

10604
04:57:29,170 --> 04:57:29,650
oh,

10605
04:57:29,650 --> 04:57:34,650
that's like show that every picture
is showing me some lobster gangsters

10606
04:57:35,170 --> 04:57:37,390
murdered people with a stripper.

10607
04:57:37,570 --> 04:57:38,410
And someone's saying,

10608
04:57:38,530 --> 04:57:38,831
look,

10609
04:57:38,831 --> 04:57:40,180
he's fucking that stripper.

10610
04:57:40,480 --> 04:57:41,201
That's all I need.

10611
04:57:41,201 --> 04:57:42,160
A motherfucking scene.

10612
04:57:42,520 --> 04:57:43,180
You know what I mean?

10613
04:57:43,180 --> 04:57:44,013
He's,

10614
04:57:44,020 --> 04:57:44,853
hey man,

10615
04:57:44,920 --> 04:57:45,753
best pictures

10616
04:57:47,690 --> 04:57:48,523
yet

10617
04:57:49,490 --> 04:57:50,180
all I need.

10618
04:57:50,180 --> 04:57:51,760
Example anther.

10619
04:57:51,880 --> 04:57:52,181
Okay,

10620
04:57:52,181 --> 04:57:53,500
that's real shit.

10621
04:57:53,680 --> 04:57:57,520
Let's bring this thing called
gangster in a picture with a stripper.

10622
04:57:57,670 --> 04:57:58,503
And I'm supposed to,

10623
04:57:58,600 --> 04:57:59,530
and you're trying to do,

10624
04:57:59,680 --> 04:58:01,210
but she has,

10625
04:58:01,211 --> 04:58:01,931
she's a stripper,

10626
04:58:01,931 --> 04:58:02,231
but deck,

10627
04:58:02,231 --> 04:58:03,240
there's no proof.

10628
04:58:05,380 --> 04:58:07,210
There's no proof that they had sex.

10629
04:58:07,211 --> 04:58:07,750
Okay.

10630
04:58:07,750 --> 04:58:08,720
He's with the kids,

10631
04:58:09,320 --> 04:58:10,690
but there's no picture.

10632
04:58:12,030 --> 04:58:17,030
Kiva fire the kid [inaudible] k a Pq BGT.

10633
04:58:18,280 --> 04:58:18,521
Hey,

10634
04:58:18,521 --> 04:58:23,521
hope for real hard on Thursday this coming
Thursday when oxide Braya then we're

10635
04:58:23,711 --> 04:58:26,020
up in New York for the comedy festival.

10636
04:58:26,160 --> 04:58:28,020
[inaudible] k.com as you,

10637
04:58:29,090 --> 04:58:30,640
I Ebi,

10638
04:58:30,760 --> 04:58:31,593
uh,

10639
04:58:31,800 --> 04:58:32,210
Haley,

10640
04:58:32,210 --> 04:58:34,030
I'm going to ask you one
question before we go.

10641
04:58:34,720 --> 04:58:35,830
I saw something that yeah,

10642
04:58:35,831 --> 04:58:37,570
John Danaher was writing
about palm strikes.

10643
04:58:37,571 --> 04:58:38,590
You're going to implement that.

10644
04:58:38,591 --> 04:58:39,424
I think about it.

10645
04:58:40,310 --> 04:58:45,310
It's for the first show of 2017 is
going to be the one 70 Ebi tournament.

10646
04:58:46,521 --> 04:58:50,090
So it's going to be regular Ebi
rules for the 16 Guy Tournament.

10647
04:58:50,390 --> 04:58:55,390
Regular Ebi 16 first show of 2017 but
we usually have three a special matches

10648
04:58:58,551 --> 04:58:59,810
and they used to be,

10649
04:59:00,070 --> 04:59:00,620
um,

10650
04:59:00,620 --> 04:59:01,610
teenagers and stuff,

10651
04:59:01,611 --> 04:59:03,950
but we can't use minors anymore and stuff.

10652
04:59:03,951 --> 04:59:04,450
So,

10653
04:59:04,450 --> 04:59:05,870
so what we're going to use those three,

10654
04:59:05,960 --> 04:59:08,300
we would do a round of
the 16 man tournament,

10655
04:59:08,450 --> 04:59:09,590
then throw a special match,

10656
04:59:09,591 --> 04:59:10,424
let everyone ref,

10657
04:59:10,430 --> 04:59:13,240
then do another round and then a
special master to everyone rest.

10658
04:59:13,370 --> 04:59:15,320
And then that final semifinal round.

10659
04:59:15,470 --> 04:59:16,700
So before the finals,

10660
04:59:16,850 --> 04:59:17,780
there's one more.

10661
04:59:17,781 --> 04:59:19,130
So there's three special matches.

10662
04:59:19,280 --> 04:59:22,580
Now when we're going to do is us three
special matches are going to be a four

10663
04:59:22,581 --> 04:59:26,270
man combat Jujitsu tournament where it's,

10664
04:59:26,320 --> 04:59:29,480
I had this clear through
the commission years ago,

10665
04:59:29,481 --> 04:59:32,450
but it kind of got stalled
with some of the rules.

10666
04:59:32,450 --> 04:59:33,231
They wouldn't let me,

10667
04:59:33,231 --> 04:59:34,064
um,

10668
04:59:34,310 --> 04:59:38,000
they didn't want to do it outside of
cage and they didn't want to give me more

10669
04:59:38,001 --> 04:59:38,811
than three,

10670
04:59:38,811 --> 04:59:39,830
three rounds.

10671
04:59:40,010 --> 04:59:44,110
So Ebi was always about
having combat Jujitsu,

10672
04:59:44,210 --> 04:59:46,310
Jujitsu with some palm strikes,

10673
04:59:46,430 --> 04:59:48,230
just to keep him honest,

10674
04:59:48,410 --> 04:59:51,350
just to keep her Jujitsu
a little more real.

10675
04:59:51,590 --> 04:59:53,660
Because when you don't have zero strikes,

10676
04:59:53,990 --> 04:59:54,261
I mean,

10677
04:59:54,261 --> 04:59:54,890
MMA,

10678
04:59:54,890 --> 04:59:55,970
MMA is the ultimate,

10679
04:59:56,060 --> 04:59:56,690
you know,

10680
04:59:56,690 --> 04:59:57,880
UFC all,

10681
04:59:57,950 --> 04:59:58,611
you got punches,

10682
04:59:58,611 --> 04:59:59,311
you've got elbows,

10683
04:59:59,311 --> 05:00:00,080
he got kicks.

10684
05:00:00,080 --> 05:00:04,580
But I want her to make w Jujitsu
just a little more realistic.

10685
05:00:04,610 --> 05:00:06,170
It's always been the plan.

10686
05:00:06,260 --> 05:00:07,580
That was before Ebi.

10687
05:00:07,581 --> 05:00:09,290
I was trying to push
combat Jiu Jitsu through.

10688
05:00:09,410 --> 05:00:12,710
We have two matches to go onto
youtube punch in combat Jujitsu,

10689
05:00:12,830 --> 05:00:13,730
we did two matches.

10690
05:00:13,731 --> 05:00:14,810
Compelling did a match.

10691
05:00:15,040 --> 05:00:17,450
Nate Harris from 10th
Planet Santa Fe did a match.

10692
05:00:17,600 --> 05:00:21,850
We did two combat Jiu Jitsu
matches and this style of Jujitsu,

10693
05:00:22,080 --> 05:00:22,460
no,

10694
05:00:22,460 --> 05:00:23,300
it's striking.

10695
05:00:23,301 --> 05:00:24,200
No Muay Thai,

10696
05:00:24,201 --> 05:00:25,034
no boxing,

10697
05:00:25,160 --> 05:00:26,060
none of that yet.

10698
05:00:26,180 --> 05:00:27,350
It's just par.

10699
05:00:27,410 --> 05:00:29,720
Just strikes when you're on the ground.

10700
05:00:29,721 --> 05:00:30,160
So it's,

10701
05:00:30,160 --> 05:00:30,440
it's,

10702
05:00:30,440 --> 05:00:34,070
it's generally for three
different types of athletes.

10703
05:00:34,340 --> 05:00:35,060
I know

10704
05:00:35,060 --> 05:00:37,890
Brad cause them all times.

10705
05:00:38,260 --> 05:00:39,093
Can I ask you a question?

10706
05:00:39,190 --> 05:00:41,020
How do you define when
someone's on the ground?

10707
05:00:41,021 --> 05:00:45,400
Let's say if someone is defending
a takedown and they have one foot,

10708
05:00:45,790 --> 05:00:46,840
one knee on the ground,

10709
05:00:46,841 --> 05:00:48,040
can you smack him in the face?

10710
05:00:48,970 --> 05:00:49,450
Listen,

10711
05:00:49,450 --> 05:00:50,141
first of all,

10712
05:00:50,141 --> 05:00:51,190
if you're getting bored,

10713
05:00:51,191 --> 05:00:51,550
Brendan,

10714
05:00:51,550 --> 05:00:52,580
I'm good.

10715
05:00:53,740 --> 05:00:55,220
No good man.

10716
05:00:55,730 --> 05:00:57,190
Man's not hers.

10717
05:00:57,280 --> 05:00:58,690
It was a long explanation.

10718
05:00:58,691 --> 05:00:58,930
No,

10719
05:00:58,930 --> 05:01:00,250
I thought we were done.

10720
05:01:00,251 --> 05:01:01,150
Explain Shit.

10721
05:01:01,180 --> 05:01:02,050
Do it man.

10722
05:01:02,051 --> 05:01:02,380
Dude,

10723
05:01:02,380 --> 05:01:03,790
that's a long explanation.

10724
05:01:03,820 --> 05:01:04,061
No,

10725
05:01:04,061 --> 05:01:04,894
no.

10726
05:01:06,910 --> 05:01:07,743
This is my shit.

10727
05:01:08,340 --> 05:01:09,150
Shit.

10728
05:01:09,150 --> 05:01:10,050
I do it man.

10729
05:01:11,390 --> 05:01:12,550
We rapping shit up.

10730
05:01:12,580 --> 05:01:13,181
He was,

10731
05:01:13,181 --> 05:01:16,690
but I was my fault because I forgot this
is something I wanted to bring up cause

10732
05:01:16,691 --> 05:01:19,840
I saw John Danaher posted about it and uh,

10733
05:01:19,841 --> 05:01:22,120
I forgot to ask it so it's not him.

10734
05:01:22,180 --> 05:01:22,870
It was me.

10735
05:01:22,870 --> 05:01:23,880
I just so fucked up.

10736
05:01:23,890 --> 05:01:25,150
Question you asked is real.

10737
05:01:25,300 --> 05:01:26,500
I mean you fucked up.

10738
05:01:28,650 --> 05:01:29,470
You told me you were,

10739
05:01:29,470 --> 05:01:30,303
we are ending.

10740
05:01:30,450 --> 05:01:31,780
Hey if you want to leave you could leave.

10741
05:01:31,781 --> 05:01:32,730
No good brother.

10742
05:01:32,830 --> 05:01:33,663
I'm done.

10743
05:01:36,100 --> 05:01:37,780
We're shutting down your feelings.

10744
05:01:40,240 --> 05:01:41,680
My feelings are not hurt.

10745
05:01:41,890 --> 05:01:43,270
You're the one that's saying,

10746
05:01:43,510 --> 05:01:44,770
Oh shit this supposed to be,

10747
05:01:44,780 --> 05:01:45,880
I'm trying to explain this shit.

10748
05:01:45,910 --> 05:01:46,121
No,

10749
05:01:46,121 --> 05:01:46,271
no,

10750
05:01:46,271 --> 05:01:46,451
no.

10751
05:01:46,451 --> 05:01:47,620
I interrupted.

10752
05:01:47,890 --> 05:01:51,850
You were just going to say Ebia and then
I brought in because I realized this

10753
05:01:51,851 --> 05:01:56,170
was something I wanted to cover
so we technically correct.

10754
05:01:56,380 --> 05:02:00,050
I think we were both way cause
he likes does wrap this kitchen.

10755
05:02:00,400 --> 05:02:02,630
I plugged my days go,

10756
05:02:02,640 --> 05:02:03,880
you're like fuck damn.

10757
05:02:03,920 --> 05:02:04,330
You're ready?

10758
05:02:04,330 --> 05:02:04,541
Okay,

10759
05:02:04,541 --> 05:02:04,960
I get it.

10760
05:02:04,960 --> 05:02:05,920
You're in trouble.

10761
05:02:06,190 --> 05:02:07,023
You have to be

10762
05:02:09,840 --> 05:02:10,800
five minutes ago.

10763
05:02:12,940 --> 05:02:14,920
We're getting off track
because I want to hear this,

10764
05:02:14,921 --> 05:02:19,540
this idea cause so you can smack to the
head into the body with an open palm.

10765
05:02:19,580 --> 05:02:20,150
Before

10766
05:02:20,150 --> 05:02:20,983
Abi,

10767
05:02:21,320 --> 05:02:24,230
I was trying to get combat
Jujitsu through the most,

10768
05:02:24,400 --> 05:02:24,790
the,

10769
05:02:24,790 --> 05:02:27,110
the Jujitsu style that would most,

10770
05:02:27,300 --> 05:02:27,530
uh,

10771
05:02:27,530 --> 05:02:28,360
best,

10772
05:02:28,360 --> 05:02:28,910
uh,

10773
05:02:28,910 --> 05:02:31,940
prepare you for a career in MMA.

10774
05:02:32,320 --> 05:02:32,480
Right?

10775
05:02:32,480 --> 05:02:33,920
So that's what I was trying to do.

10776
05:02:34,100 --> 05:02:35,030
I had a couple fights.

10777
05:02:35,031 --> 05:02:36,110
We did it at university,

10778
05:02:36,111 --> 05:02:38,820
Lma w got it clear through the commission,

10779
05:02:39,060 --> 05:02:44,060
but I knew that we couldn't have
it done in a cage and three,

10780
05:02:44,101 --> 05:02:45,450
three minute rounds can I,

10781
05:02:45,630 --> 05:02:46,290
that wasn't going to,

10782
05:02:46,290 --> 05:02:47,220
that wasn't going to cut it.

10783
05:02:47,221 --> 05:02:48,660
So I decided that's when I decided,

10784
05:02:48,930 --> 05:02:49,381
fuck it,

10785
05:02:49,381 --> 05:02:50,580
I'm not getting the rules I want.

10786
05:02:50,590 --> 05:02:53,730
Let me just do Ebi submission only.

10787
05:02:53,910 --> 05:02:54,750
No strikes,

10788
05:02:54,810 --> 05:02:55,290
submission,

10789
05:02:55,290 --> 05:02:56,123
only.

10790
05:02:56,250 --> 05:02:57,870
Get that going and see what happens.

10791
05:02:57,960 --> 05:03:01,980
And then later I'm going to
come back and bring back combat.

10792
05:03:02,000 --> 05:03:02,550
You get to,

10793
05:03:02,550 --> 05:03:03,390
and that's what I'm doing now.

10794
05:03:03,510 --> 05:03:05,430
I'm not eliminating Ebi.

10795
05:03:05,580 --> 05:03:07,290
Who knows what's gonna
happen in the future.

10796
05:03:07,290 --> 05:03:08,400
I don't know what it's going to be like.

10797
05:03:08,580 --> 05:03:13,110
But the first show in 2017 is
going to be a 16 man tournament.

10798
05:03:13,290 --> 05:03:15,780
Just like it's always
been submission only.

10799
05:03:15,840 --> 05:03:16,621
Same rules,

10800
05:03:16,621 --> 05:03:17,454
same overtime,

10801
05:03:17,460 --> 05:03:22,460
but in between every round we're going
to have a four man combat Jiu Jitsu match

10802
05:03:22,980 --> 05:03:25,170
where there's palm strikes allowed.

10803
05:03:25,260 --> 05:03:26,220
It's not an MMA,

10804
05:03:26,310 --> 05:03:27,420
it's not the most gangster.

10805
05:03:27,540 --> 05:03:29,730
It just makes you just
so a little more honest.

10806
05:03:29,850 --> 05:03:31,230
You want to do this style.

10807
05:03:31,410 --> 05:03:32,880
How about I slap you in the face?

10808
05:03:33,050 --> 05:03:33,410
Let's,

10809
05:03:33,410 --> 05:03:33,730
let's,

10810
05:03:33,730 --> 05:03:34,050
let's,

10811
05:03:34,050 --> 05:03:35,400
let's get a little more real.

10812
05:03:35,430 --> 05:03:37,070
Can I knock them out
or now you could knock.

10813
05:03:37,230 --> 05:03:41,910
It's called finish only Jujitsu
because you can fucking Tko a guy.

10814
05:03:41,970 --> 05:03:42,541
You could knock.

10815
05:03:42,541 --> 05:03:44,190
A guy asked you this
or you can finish him.

10816
05:03:44,191 --> 05:03:44,860
Can I ask you this?

10817
05:03:44,860 --> 05:03:45,590
What do I show him?

10818
05:03:45,590 --> 05:03:46,620
What about submission only?

10819
05:03:46,650 --> 05:03:47,790
What about karate chops?

10820
05:03:47,850 --> 05:03:49,590
You allow in chronic chest pump strikes.

10821
05:03:51,360 --> 05:03:52,560
You can kind of,

10822
05:03:52,740 --> 05:03:55,920
you can kind of bring it like it's a
palm strike while you're hitting with the

10823
05:03:55,921 --> 05:03:56,820
blade of the hand.

10824
05:03:57,060 --> 05:03:58,070
And if you do that tough,

10825
05:03:58,110 --> 05:03:58,650
you could,

10826
05:03:58,650 --> 05:04:01,440
you could knock fucking
people out for sure.

10827
05:04:01,780 --> 05:04:02,160
I mean you,

10828
05:04:02,160 --> 05:04:02,470
you,

10829
05:04:02,470 --> 05:04:02,840
you,

10830
05:04:02,840 --> 05:04:03,370
you really,

10831
05:04:03,370 --> 05:04:08,270
you'd be well served to just ground and
pound and drop these karate chops to

10832
05:04:08,280 --> 05:04:09,480
look like bitch slaps.

10833
05:04:09,481 --> 05:04:09,870
Yeah,

10834
05:04:09,870 --> 05:04:11,220
because if you're just talking about just,

10835
05:04:11,260 --> 05:04:14,940
or one of the things that boss Rutan
showed is that if you can get your hand

10836
05:04:14,941 --> 05:04:15,661
flexibility,

10837
05:04:15,661 --> 05:04:18,820
good boss route and figured
out how to pose hands way man.

10838
05:04:19,110 --> 05:04:23,490
And he was fucking guys up by
punching like a real punch.

10839
05:04:23,640 --> 05:04:26,220
Like they dropped those palms
down on you home strike.

10840
05:04:26,300 --> 05:04:27,180
It doesn't hurt.

10841
05:04:27,181 --> 05:04:29,670
See that's the thing is you
can hit shit super hard.

10842
05:04:29,671 --> 05:04:32,640
We don't prompt you break
shit with your knuckles.

10843
05:04:32,760 --> 05:04:34,950
It's really almost a better way to strike.

10844
05:04:34,980 --> 05:04:37,650
That could be a problem with a rich hand.

10845
05:04:37,800 --> 05:04:41,610
But we're going to learn as we go
and there's going to be some tweaks.

10846
05:04:41,790 --> 05:04:44,430
Big John is very instrumental in all this.

10847
05:04:44,520 --> 05:04:47,250
The commission Cammo it's all legit.

10848
05:04:47,340 --> 05:04:49,340
It's not some Indian reservation shit.

10849
05:04:49,470 --> 05:04:50,700
We're doing it all legit.

10850
05:04:51,000 --> 05:04:51,330
Right.

10851
05:04:51,330 --> 05:04:53,040
And we're going to bring
it in slowly right now.

10852
05:04:53,041 --> 05:04:54,780
So we have a 60 man tournament,

10853
05:04:54,870 --> 05:04:59,130
but in between every round we have room
for three fights to have a four man

10854
05:04:59,131 --> 05:04:59,700
tournament,

10855
05:04:59,700 --> 05:05:00,533
we need three.

10856
05:05:00,920 --> 05:05:01,770
If there's hitting,

10857
05:05:01,771 --> 05:05:03,570
you have to have commission
now because Jiu Jitsu,

10858
05:05:03,571 --> 05:05:04,321
there's no commission.

10859
05:05:04,321 --> 05:05:04,590
Right,

10860
05:05:04,590 --> 05:05:09,180
but do you worry about the commission
there to worry about people getting hurt?

10861
05:05:09,390 --> 05:05:10,350
People are going to get hurt.

10862
05:05:10,380 --> 05:05:11,213
Fuck yeah.

10863
05:05:11,630 --> 05:05:12,181
Fuck yeah,

10864
05:05:12,181 --> 05:05:14,460
but you have to have like different
kinds of services on hand.

10865
05:05:15,980 --> 05:05:20,980
We have the com now since we're doing
this along with the 16 man tournament,

10866
05:05:21,300 --> 05:05:22,920
that regular Ebi rules,

10867
05:05:23,040 --> 05:05:25,380
we're going to have a
four man combat Jujitsu.

10868
05:05:25,540 --> 05:05:26,820
We're going to have the commission there.

10869
05:05:26,970 --> 05:05:28,410
There's going to be all the stamp,

10870
05:05:28,890 --> 05:05:33,090
everything that that the commission wants
we're doing and we're going to bring

10871
05:05:33,091 --> 05:05:33,360
it in.

10872
05:05:33,360 --> 05:05:34,021
Who knows?

10873
05:05:34,021 --> 05:05:34,980
It could go two ways.

10874
05:05:35,140 --> 05:05:40,140
It could be a complete disaster or it
could be fucking something that that

10875
05:05:40,991 --> 05:05:42,070
they're just takes off and,

10876
05:05:42,150 --> 05:05:44,800
and we can't even go back
to regular Ebi roles.

10877
05:05:44,980 --> 05:05:47,690
I don't fucking know we're
going to go through labor.

10878
05:05:48,400 --> 05:05:49,233
I Dunno.

10879
05:05:49,240 --> 05:05:51,190
I think that it's a good idea.

10880
05:05:51,250 --> 05:05:52,330
So really good idea.

10881
05:05:52,510 --> 05:05:57,510
But I think that to achieve the highest
levels of Jiu Jitsu in like the tactical

10882
05:05:57,611 --> 05:05:58,340
sense,

10883
05:05:58,340 --> 05:06:00,070
and I'm thinking you could
have too much striking.

10884
05:06:00,370 --> 05:06:03,880
I think as soon as you start
throwing wax and slaps in there,

10885
05:06:04,030 --> 05:06:05,110
like a change is shit.

10886
05:06:05,290 --> 05:06:06,880
Because once a guy gets that off,

10887
05:06:07,060 --> 05:06:10,390
you're like all your job is now just to
defend against that and maybe you would

10888
05:06:10,400 --> 05:06:11,110
be offensive.

10889
05:06:11,110 --> 05:06:11,590
Jujitsu.

10890
05:06:11,590 --> 05:06:14,200
Why's it important that it's both?

10891
05:06:14,740 --> 05:06:19,740
I think both of us combat you get to
is of the focus isn't trying to hurt to

10892
05:06:20,321 --> 05:06:21,280
hurt anybody.

10893
05:06:21,520 --> 05:06:23,080
There will be people that,

10894
05:06:23,290 --> 05:06:24,070
that uh,

10895
05:06:24,070 --> 05:06:28,540
take advantage of the rules and really
focus on fucking Baas Rutan Palm Strike.

10896
05:06:28,570 --> 05:06:29,920
There's going to be Tkos.

10897
05:06:30,040 --> 05:06:30,370
It's,

10898
05:06:30,370 --> 05:06:34,140
it's finish also going to
be guys that elbow you slap.

10899
05:06:34,740 --> 05:06:36,020
Those are legal and many,

10900
05:06:36,021 --> 05:06:37,240
even if it's illegal,

10901
05:06:37,390 --> 05:06:38,850
if you're going like this,

10902
05:06:39,970 --> 05:06:41,440
they coming down with slaps.

10903
05:06:41,441 --> 05:06:42,274
They might live,

10904
05:06:42,710 --> 05:06:45,580
add that to it and there's not a
whole lot you can do to stop that.

10905
05:06:45,610 --> 05:06:48,790
That's going to be considered like
a knee on the ground at a toner.

10906
05:06:48,820 --> 05:06:50,530
We're going to treat
it this exact same way.

10907
05:06:51,400 --> 05:06:52,061
There might be,

10908
05:06:52,061 --> 05:06:52,680
um,

10909
05:06:52,680 --> 05:06:54,010
seems more qualifications.

10910
05:06:54,120 --> 05:06:54,730
Hey,

10911
05:06:54,730 --> 05:06:56,260
it might be a disaster.

10912
05:06:56,300 --> 05:06:56,481
No,

10913
05:06:56,481 --> 05:06:56,690
no,

10914
05:06:56,690 --> 05:06:56,881
no,

10915
05:06:56,881 --> 05:06:57,080
no,

10916
05:06:57,080 --> 05:06:57,450
no,

10917
05:06:57,450 --> 05:06:57,870
no.

10918
05:06:57,870 --> 05:06:59,260
I'm just stay in the elbow.

10919
05:06:59,850 --> 05:07:01,090
Crush day one.

10920
05:07:01,180 --> 05:07:06,180
The plan for 10th Planet from day one
was to try to make Jujitsu more effective

10921
05:07:07,900 --> 05:07:08,920
for when their strikes.

10922
05:07:08,921 --> 05:07:11,140
That's always been the plan from day one,

10923
05:07:11,380 --> 05:07:12,213
always.

10924
05:07:12,340 --> 05:07:17,340
And now there's an opportunity
to make that just that a reality.

10925
05:07:17,650 --> 05:07:18,760
And who knows?

10926
05:07:18,820 --> 05:07:19,900
Maybe it's a disaster.

10927
05:07:19,901 --> 05:07:20,680
Maybe it takes off.

10928
05:07:20,680 --> 05:07:22,030
I don't know about we're going to do both.

10929
05:07:22,450 --> 05:07:23,410
And uh,

10930
05:07:23,620 --> 05:07:24,160
you know,

10931
05:07:24,160 --> 05:07:24,730
uh,

10932
05:07:24,730 --> 05:07:25,990
I just would,

10933
05:07:26,560 --> 05:07:27,490
me personally,

10934
05:07:27,940 --> 05:07:30,520
I think if you add some palm strikes,

10935
05:07:30,730 --> 05:07:34,720
it's gonna make your Jujitsu more real,

10936
05:07:34,990 --> 05:07:36,100
more honest.

10937
05:07:36,430 --> 05:07:38,710
And Not Anna May not,

10938
05:07:38,711 --> 05:07:38,951
you know,

10939
05:07:38,951 --> 05:07:39,430
there's,

10940
05:07:39,430 --> 05:07:41,110
we're not dealing with striking standing,

10941
05:07:41,111 --> 05:07:41,980
standing combat.

10942
05:07:42,030 --> 05:07:43,420
You have to strike a standing.

10943
05:07:43,510 --> 05:07:44,343
Is this wrestling?

10944
05:07:44,410 --> 05:07:44,651
No.

10945
05:07:44,651 --> 05:07:45,820
Striking at all.

10946
05:07:46,000 --> 05:07:48,490
So this is going to attract
three different types of people.

10947
05:07:48,491 --> 05:07:50,320
It's going to attract grapplers,

10948
05:07:50,440 --> 05:07:54,610
Jujitsu and wrestlers that want to
eventually transition to the MMA.

10949
05:07:54,760 --> 05:07:57,220
This sport is going to be a
great way to get their feet wet.

10950
05:07:57,490 --> 05:08:01,270
Also it's going to take people that
have had 18 and a knife fights and they

10951
05:08:01,271 --> 05:08:03,520
realize this is just too fucking intense,

10952
05:08:03,700 --> 05:08:05,740
but I'll do this combat [inaudible] shit.

10953
05:08:05,890 --> 05:08:06,760
This is Tamesha.

10954
05:08:06,820 --> 05:08:07,421
They look at it,

10955
05:08:07,421 --> 05:08:08,940
it's tame lightweight shoe.

10956
05:08:09,070 --> 05:08:10,330
It depends where you're coming from.

10957
05:08:10,450 --> 05:08:11,700
And then there's also going to be,

10958
05:08:11,740 --> 05:08:12,680
there's going to be three,

10959
05:08:12,910 --> 05:08:15,430
there's going to be your
third type of person.

10960
05:08:15,660 --> 05:08:20,140
It's just a Jujitsu guy that doesn't
want to go and in May at all.

10961
05:08:20,200 --> 05:08:21,070
No dreams,

10962
05:08:21,160 --> 05:08:21,993
never done it,

10963
05:08:22,060 --> 05:08:22,893
no dreams,

10964
05:08:22,930 --> 05:08:23,231
just,

10965
05:08:23,231 --> 05:08:27,700
but would love to take it to the next
level because it's obvious if you add

10966
05:08:27,701 --> 05:08:30,400
Jujitsu with some fucking palm strikes,

10967
05:08:30,550 --> 05:08:33,230
it keeps it a little more honest you,

10968
05:08:33,470 --> 05:08:36,740
because when there's no strikes
and it's just pure Jujitsu,

10969
05:08:36,741 --> 05:08:37,574
I love that.

10970
05:08:37,730 --> 05:08:38,980
But at the same time you're,

10971
05:08:39,180 --> 05:08:40,370
you're watching shit happen.

10972
05:08:40,371 --> 05:08:41,000
You're like,

10973
05:08:41,000 --> 05:08:41,301
man,

10974
05:08:41,301 --> 05:08:41,571
that,

10975
05:08:41,571 --> 05:08:41,930
that,

10976
05:08:41,930 --> 05:08:44,540
that wouldn't happen in a
real goddamn fight here.

10977
05:08:44,750 --> 05:08:47,000
And that would happen in a
real God damn fight here.

10978
05:08:47,180 --> 05:08:48,890
So as a fan of the sport,

10979
05:08:49,040 --> 05:08:52,790
as a fan who came in
through the UFC to MMA,

10980
05:08:53,030 --> 05:08:56,090
that's what got me into
Jujitsu is the fighting.

10981
05:08:56,270 --> 05:08:56,920
So,

10982
05:08:56,920 --> 05:08:57,140
uh,

10983
05:08:57,140 --> 05:08:57,973
to me,

10984
05:08:58,040 --> 05:08:58,311
uh,

10985
05:08:58,311 --> 05:09:02,240
it's important that we
develop a Jujitsu system or,

10986
05:09:02,270 --> 05:09:06,200
and the sport that goes along
with it that prepares you for,

10987
05:09:06,260 --> 05:09:11,260
it's a Jujitsu style combat Jujitsu that
will prepare you more for either MMA or

10988
05:09:12,411 --> 05:09:12,681
real,

10989
05:09:12,681 --> 05:09:13,670
like a little more.

10990
05:09:13,740 --> 05:09:14,030
We know,

10991
05:09:14,030 --> 05:09:14,541
and I can look,

10992
05:09:14,541 --> 05:09:18,870
one way you could look at it is like
we have boxing than we have kickboxing.

10993
05:09:18,871 --> 05:09:19,040
Yeah.

10994
05:09:19,040 --> 05:09:20,000
Then we have more time.

10995
05:09:21,400 --> 05:09:24,440
You have to Jitsu and you
have calm attitude to them
rather than another level.

10996
05:09:25,040 --> 05:09:29,060
[inaudible] sees the Beth
Beth tie over boxing.

10997
05:09:29,061 --> 05:09:29,241
Okay.

10998
05:09:29,241 --> 05:09:29,900
Let's boxing.

10999
05:09:29,900 --> 05:09:30,501
What about kicks?

11000
05:09:30,501 --> 05:09:31,161
What do I lend kicks?

11001
05:09:31,161 --> 05:09:31,994
We'll throw that in there.

11002
05:09:32,000 --> 05:09:32,660
I like it.

11003
05:09:32,660 --> 05:09:33,020
Yeah.

11004
05:09:33,020 --> 05:09:33,830
So it's Jujitsu.

11005
05:09:33,830 --> 05:09:35,570
What some sweats and will
because it's going to go down.

11006
05:09:35,840 --> 05:09:37,250
And the of November 6th,

11007
05:09:37,670 --> 05:09:38,421
November six,

11008
05:09:38,421 --> 05:09:39,880
is that the light heavyweights?

11009
05:09:39,950 --> 05:09:41,180
No Combat Jujitsu.

11010
05:09:41,640 --> 05:09:42,020
Uh,

11011
05:09:42,020 --> 05:09:47,020
December 2nd in Mexico City is the
Bantam Lloyd's Geo Martinez defending his

11012
05:09:47,061 --> 05:09:47,894
title.

11013
05:09:48,290 --> 05:09:49,670
That's just the same.

11014
05:09:50,420 --> 05:09:53,690
We have two shows coming up
that that's not being changed,

11015
05:09:53,780 --> 05:09:56,870
but the first show in 2017
we don't have a date yet.

11016
05:09:57,020 --> 05:10:01,100
It's going to be one the one seven
to welterweight championship.

11017
05:10:01,280 --> 05:10:04,850
Gary [inaudible] is the one 70
championed the welterweight champion.

11018
05:10:04,970 --> 05:10:05,810
He's going to come back.

11019
05:10:05,870 --> 05:10:07,790
That's going to be regular Ebi roles,

11020
05:10:07,940 --> 05:10:10,520
but we're also gonna have
a four man tournament,

11021
05:10:10,680 --> 05:10:11,120
uh,

11022
05:10:11,120 --> 05:10:15,350
combat Jujitsu on the side
simultaneously going along with it.

11023
05:10:15,680 --> 05:10:16,870
Who knows how it's going to turn out.

11024
05:10:16,871 --> 05:10:18,650
I don't even know how the
fuck it's going to turn out,

11025
05:10:18,830 --> 05:10:20,090
but we got the,

11026
05:10:20,240 --> 05:10:20,451
um,

11027
05:10:20,451 --> 05:10:23,960
the support of the camel
athletic commission and we're
going to do it and we're

11028
05:10:23,961 --> 05:10:25,470
going to w w w it's going to be a,

11029
05:10:25,640 --> 05:10:26,540
we're going to learn from it.

11030
05:10:26,540 --> 05:10:27,230
We're going to,

11031
05:10:27,230 --> 05:10:27,740
cause we've,

11032
05:10:27,740 --> 05:10:27,971
there's,

11033
05:10:27,971 --> 05:10:28,091
there,

11034
05:10:28,091 --> 05:10:29,330
there isn't a sport like that.

11035
05:10:29,331 --> 05:10:32,450
We don't know how it's going to look
and where people are going to exploit

11036
05:10:32,451 --> 05:10:34,640
little holes and we're
going to have to tweak shit.

11037
05:10:34,850 --> 05:10:35,480
We don't know.

11038
05:10:35,480 --> 05:10:36,530
But the rules are,

11039
05:10:36,710 --> 05:10:39,890
the basic rules are if
one guy is on the ground,

11040
05:10:40,340 --> 05:10:44,750
like if you pull guard and you're on
their back and I'm standing horse stance

11041
05:10:44,751 --> 05:10:45,320
style,

11042
05:10:45,320 --> 05:10:47,690
I could fucking palm strike you right?

11043
05:10:47,720 --> 05:10:48,500
If I got neon,

11044
05:10:48,500 --> 05:10:49,550
the belly on you,

11045
05:10:49,820 --> 05:10:51,080
I get palm strike you.

11046
05:10:51,230 --> 05:10:53,090
So as soon as it got to be on top,

11047
05:10:53,091 --> 05:10:54,230
you have to be on top on the ground.

11048
05:10:54,770 --> 05:10:56,270
As soon as the guy is grounded.

11049
05:10:56,330 --> 05:10:57,710
Which means if a guy pulls guard,

11050
05:10:57,711 --> 05:10:58,101
he's grounded.

11051
05:10:58,101 --> 05:11:00,470
As soon as one guy has
grounded palm strikes.

11052
05:11:00,471 --> 05:11:01,101
Can commend.

11053
05:11:01,101 --> 05:11:02,090
What about when you come,

11054
05:11:02,120 --> 05:11:05,840
you're coming up like say if you go to
dogfight and then you get to one knee and

11055
05:11:05,841 --> 05:11:07,610
you pop back up and you both standing up.

11056
05:11:07,730 --> 05:11:11,660
When can you stop striking
you when you get to dog fight?

11057
05:11:15,170 --> 05:11:18,560
That's a good question because sometimes
you're in dog fight on your knees and

11058
05:11:18,561 --> 05:11:21,710
if someone could just upper cut you boss
and style on the face and knock you the

11059
05:11:21,711 --> 05:11:22,430
fuck out.

11060
05:11:22,430 --> 05:11:23,480
Yeah we're going to have you,

11061
05:11:23,481 --> 05:11:25,770
that's a very good question
right there in dog.

11062
05:11:25,771 --> 05:11:25,940
Fuck.

11063
05:11:25,940 --> 05:11:29,010
Cause there's dog fight
when both competitors are on
their knees and there's dog

11064
05:11:29,011 --> 05:11:30,350
fight when they're both standing.

11065
05:11:30,530 --> 05:11:33,990
So just like how Moitai not allowed to
kick guy in the head when they're down.

11066
05:11:34,640 --> 05:11:35,250
You know you can,

11067
05:11:35,250 --> 05:11:35,970
you can trip them.

11068
05:11:35,970 --> 05:11:36,770
I can take them down.

11069
05:11:36,770 --> 05:11:40,380
You can't kick him in the head if you're
in dog fight at both guys are standing

11070
05:11:40,381 --> 05:11:40,531
up.

11071
05:11:40,531 --> 05:11:41,364
No striking.

11072
05:11:41,370 --> 05:11:44,490
If you had a dog fight and both guys
are on their knees or one guy's on his

11073
05:11:44,491 --> 05:11:44,880
knees,

11074
05:11:44,880 --> 05:11:45,713
you can strike.

11075
05:11:45,750 --> 05:11:46,950
It's going to be something like that.

11076
05:11:48,360 --> 05:11:49,830
But really it's all designed.

11077
05:11:50,070 --> 05:11:55,070
It's all designed to make Jujitsu more
effective as a martial art because it,

11078
05:11:56,190 --> 05:11:56,661
if it,

11079
05:11:56,661 --> 05:11:59,730
if it works and it takes off and people
like it and we do it for 10 years.

11080
05:11:59,731 --> 05:12:01,950
When people are and combat do
you get to becomes a sport.

11081
05:12:02,370 --> 05:12:07,370
I guarantee you the champions of combat
Jujitsu will translate to MMA a lot

11082
05:12:09,301 --> 05:12:13,740
easier than a champions
of other grappling genres.

11083
05:12:13,800 --> 05:12:14,760
In my opinion.

11084
05:12:14,790 --> 05:12:15,571
I could be wrong,

11085
05:12:15,571 --> 05:12:16,950
but it's just like,

11086
05:12:17,120 --> 05:12:18,090
seems like a good idea.

11087
05:12:18,150 --> 05:12:18,301
Yeah,

11088
05:12:18,301 --> 05:12:18,870
I like it.

11089
05:12:18,870 --> 05:12:19,291
I like it.

11090
05:12:19,291 --> 05:12:24,220
I like it as a new step
from Jujitsu to MMA and die.

11091
05:12:24,660 --> 05:12:25,320
Um,

11092
05:12:25,320 --> 05:12:26,760
and Ebi,

11093
05:12:26,790 --> 05:12:28,440
November 6th is the next one.

11094
05:12:28,441 --> 05:12:29,011
Number six.

11095
05:12:29,011 --> 05:12:31,080
You can watch it on UFC fight pass.

11096
05:12:31,081 --> 05:12:32,040
It's a Sunday.

11097
05:12:32,280 --> 05:12:34,380
It starts at 6:00 PM.

11098
05:12:34,560 --> 05:12:37,890
Gordon Ryan is trying to take that
light heavyweight championship.

11099
05:12:37,891 --> 05:12:39,260
Vinnie Maga classes in it.

11100
05:12:39,840 --> 05:12:44,760
Gibson saw that we got some
bad motherfuckers in this
one 2000 this is the first

11101
05:12:44,761 --> 05:12:45,980
time we've done light heavyweight,

11102
05:12:45,990 --> 05:12:49,740
two oh five and there's no champion
and you know of any mega last wants it.

11103
05:12:49,920 --> 05:12:50,701
Gordon Ryan,

11104
05:12:50,701 --> 05:12:53,610
he's the one 85 champion
and the absolute champion.

11105
05:12:53,730 --> 05:12:56,420
He's trying to take that two oh
five that Danaher her death squad.

11106
05:12:56,490 --> 05:12:58,140
They're trying to take
all the god damn belts.

11107
05:12:58,230 --> 05:12:58,930
Eddie coming.

11108
05:12:58,930 --> 05:13:01,990
This is going down to one
35 to take that bad boy.

11109
05:13:02,490 --> 05:13:05,910
He's trying to and and that's
December 2nd in Mexico City.

11110
05:13:06,060 --> 05:13:07,320
Geo Martinez,

11111
05:13:07,500 --> 05:13:08,460
10 plan of black belt.

11112
05:13:08,461 --> 05:13:10,660
He's the champion come the Denner.

11113
05:13:10,670 --> 05:13:12,360
That's why they want
all the goddamned belts.

11114
05:13:12,510 --> 05:13:13,710
So it's a beautiful thing man.

11115
05:13:13,711 --> 05:13:13,970
There's,

11116
05:13:13,970 --> 05:13:16,140
there's a serious war going on.

11117
05:13:16,141 --> 05:13:19,860
It's a friend of the rider friendly
rivalry and everyone's improving from it,

11118
05:13:19,861 --> 05:13:20,101
man.

11119
05:13:20,101 --> 05:13:20,580
Every,

11120
05:13:20,580 --> 05:13:20,821
you know,

11121
05:13:20,821 --> 05:13:24,360
we're looking at what the
with John Danaher's don't
with them leg locks and man,

11122
05:13:24,420 --> 05:13:27,240
everyone's jumping on that and
trying to catch up and word.

11123
05:13:27,360 --> 05:13:32,360
We're knee deep in that leg lock
game because of what DDS has done.

11124
05:13:32,700 --> 05:13:36,540
And so you know when you draw DDS DDS,

11125
05:13:37,170 --> 05:13:37,950
they got that,

11126
05:13:37,950 --> 05:13:41,550
they got that leg lock system down
like no motherfuckers on the planet.

11127
05:13:41,640 --> 05:13:42,690
You think you know leg lock.

11128
05:13:42,840 --> 05:13:47,010
Oh I think I could defend on Gluck's roll
with one of them motherfuckers and see

11129
05:13:47,011 --> 05:13:48,750
if you could defend leg
locks up every week.

11130
05:13:48,870 --> 05:13:53,670
So what that's done with what's transpired
in Ebi with with the domination of

11131
05:13:53,671 --> 05:13:55,140
the DDS squad,

11132
05:13:55,290 --> 05:13:57,330
it made me realize that damn,

11133
05:13:57,480 --> 05:14:00,030
we haven't been paying enough
attention to leg locks.

11134
05:14:00,150 --> 05:14:02,660
So for the last few years
who spend a lot of attention,

11135
05:14:02,680 --> 05:14:03,081
I'm like left.

11136
05:14:03,081 --> 05:14:04,490
So all the shit that's going down,

11137
05:14:04,510 --> 05:14:07,320
just making us better
and we love the rivalry.

11138
05:14:07,321 --> 05:14:07,951
And you know,

11139
05:14:07,951 --> 05:14:08,610
there's a,

11140
05:14:08,610 --> 05:14:09,710
there's all these little sex,

11141
05:14:09,711 --> 05:14:13,410
there's like the Ibj jam guys trying
to prove themselves in sub only.

11142
05:14:13,530 --> 05:14:17,340
And then there's the DDS
guys are dominating everybody
that fucking up the 10th

11143
05:14:17,341 --> 05:14:18,120
planet guys,

11144
05:14:18,120 --> 05:14:19,050
Gio fucking,

11145
05:14:19,170 --> 05:14:22,290
he's battling like a God damn barbarian.

11146
05:14:22,440 --> 05:14:23,820
And then you've got all the random,

11147
05:14:24,630 --> 05:14:27,210
the random that has like
Joe Soto from the UFC.

11148
05:14:27,300 --> 05:14:29,350
Fucking get into the finals against Joe,

11149
05:14:29,430 --> 05:14:29,920
uh,

11150
05:14:29,920 --> 05:14:32,230
against Eddie Cummings
and just go on leg lock,

11151
05:14:32,231 --> 05:14:34,000
leg lock from way in the finals.

11152
05:14:34,001 --> 05:14:34,834
Joe Soto,

11153
05:14:34,900 --> 05:14:36,460
you have c one,

11154
05:14:36,461 --> 05:14:39,100
a 35 contender.

11155
05:14:39,220 --> 05:14:42,210
He's in there battling with
Eddie comes leg lock for luck.

11156
05:14:42,211 --> 05:14:42,371
Luck.

11157
05:14:42,371 --> 05:14:46,710
Turns out fucking Dave to rouse
a leg lock maniac who has,

11158
05:14:46,800 --> 05:14:47,530
eh,

11159
05:14:47,530 --> 05:14:49,540
it wasn't a big deal for Joe said he did,

11160
05:14:49,541 --> 05:14:50,770
ended up getting caught or leg lock.

11161
05:14:51,070 --> 05:14:53,400
But you're seeing those random
guys like another random guy,

11162
05:14:53,401 --> 05:14:57,190
the Russian bear fucking
Rustam Chizzy of Holy Shit.

11163
05:14:57,490 --> 05:14:58,150
So it,

11164
05:14:58,150 --> 05:14:58,450
it's,

11165
05:14:58,450 --> 05:14:59,980
it's a beautiful thing that's going on.

11166
05:15:00,040 --> 05:15:01,240
We're all trying to win.

11167
05:15:01,241 --> 05:15:02,400
We're all trying to get better where,

11168
05:15:02,530 --> 05:15:04,720
but it's a friendly rivalry
and we all love each other.

11169
05:15:04,930 --> 05:15:05,763
And um,

11170
05:15:06,100 --> 05:15:06,610
you know,

11171
05:15:06,610 --> 05:15:07,420
we're just,

11172
05:15:07,420 --> 05:15:07,810
we're in,

11173
05:15:07,810 --> 05:15:08,740
we're enjoying the ride.

11174
05:15:08,810 --> 05:15:09,260
Beautiful.

11175
05:15:09,260 --> 05:15:10,580
Ebi Six.

11176
05:15:10,640 --> 05:15:11,990

11178
05:15:13,210 --> 05:15:13,800
or six,

11179
05:15:13,800 --> 05:15:16,300
you got to try and pass
and also you could,

11180
05:15:16,420 --> 05:15:20,050
you could get it on a
ufc.tv or EBI official.com.

11181
05:15:20,130 --> 05:15:20,701
Beautiful.

11182
05:15:20,701 --> 05:15:21,810
And Cameron Hanes.

11183
05:15:22,080 --> 05:15:24,510
Cameron our hands on Instagram.

11184
05:15:24,540 --> 05:15:26,580
Who the fuck is Cameron

11185
05:15:27,810 --> 05:15:28,321
Instagram.

11186
05:15:28,321 --> 05:15:29,670
Not Change that shit over.

05:15:29,820 --> 05:15:30,450
I Dunno.

11188
05:15:30,450 --> 05:15:31,620
They need to get on the ball.

11189
05:15:31,680 --> 05:15:32,730
You searched Cameron Hanes.

11190
05:15:32,731 --> 05:15:34,290
I'll come 500 visitors.

11191
05:15:34,320 --> 05:15:34,591
I know.

11192
05:15:34,591 --> 05:15:35,110
It's crazy.

11193
05:15:35,110 --> 05:15:37,410
But if it was another
dude named Cameron Hanes,

11194
05:15:37,440 --> 05:15:38,310
why doesn't he let go?

11195
05:15:38,311 --> 05:15:38,551
Look,

11196
05:15:38,551 --> 05:15:38,880

11197
05:15:38,880 --> 05:15:39,571

11199
05:15:41,360 --> 05:15:42,160
My,

11200
05:15:42,160 --> 05:15:43,460
I got my own head ma'am.

11201
05:15:43,710 --> 05:15:45,600
But Cameron or Cameron?

11202
05:15:45,601 --> 05:15:46,830
Our hands on Instagram.

11203
05:15:47,160 --> 05:15:48,450
Cameron Hanes on Facebook.

11204
05:15:48,830 --> 05:15:49,663
No Sir.

11205
05:15:49,850 --> 05:15:50,160
Uh,

11206
05:15:50,160 --> 05:15:50,881
you don't use Twitter,

11207
05:15:50,881 --> 05:15:51,714
Huh?

11208
05:15:51,920 --> 05:15:52,310
Not really.

11209
05:15:52,310 --> 05:15:52,830
I do.

11210
05:15:52,830 --> 05:15:53,540
You do now?

11211
05:15:53,540 --> 05:15:53,950
No.

11212
05:15:53,950 --> 05:15:54,160
No.

11213
05:15:54,160 --> 05:15:55,160
It was automatically there.

11214
05:15:55,161 --> 05:15:57,120
Automatically get on Twitter.

11215
05:15:57,121 --> 05:15:58,170
So don't be scared of Twitter.

11216
05:15:58,450 --> 05:16:00,840
Briand and motherfucking Shab.

11217

05:16:02,341 --> 05:16:02,441

11219
05:16:02,441 --> 05:16:03,120

11220
05:16:03,120 --> 05:16:05,880
so we'll end this and life.

11221
05:16:06,000 --> 05:16:07,180
God Damn Marathon.

11222
05:16:07,190 --> 05:16:08,510
