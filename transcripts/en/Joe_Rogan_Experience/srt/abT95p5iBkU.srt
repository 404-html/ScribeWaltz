1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,003
Yoga

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,950
three,

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,730
two,

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,730
one and we're live sugar Shawn and uh,

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,263
Tim Welch,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,610
your friend that you
brought with you here today,

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,001
friend,

8
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:20,511
teammate,

9
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:22,430
coach from Montana,

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,931
Montana people.

11
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:24,350
It's good.

12
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,183
It's a good place.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,911
Yeah,

14
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,331
it is.

15
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,410
But for what we do,

16
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,244
it's not the best place.

17
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:28,851
Yeah.

18
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,590
How much training can you get in Montana?

19
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,070
It's not,

20
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,860
not the best buy.

21
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,140
Like when I was there,

22
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,993
uh,

23
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,940
two years ago,

24
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,540
pheasant hunting with Anthony Bordain
and that guy is such a maniac.

25
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,620
He trains everywhere.

26
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,620
He goes every day and he found some club,

27
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,010
some local Jujitsu club
in Montana and Bozeman.

28
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,180
I was rolling with people.

29
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,051
Yeah.

30
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,180
Bozeman is probably one of
the better places to train.

31
00:00:50,181 --> 00:00:53,420
But the one thing good about being
from Montana is when we're in Phoenix,

32
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,160
it's like a big process.

33
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:55,994
Getting a fight.

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,301
Sugar.

35
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,560
How many amateur fights you have?

36
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,871
Yeah,

37
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,930
I had 14 and the nae fights,

38
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,680
amateur MMA fights for kickboxing,

39
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,500
couple of boxing.

40
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,333
It was every weekend.

41
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,470
I,

42
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,303
if Montana,

43
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,341
Montana,

44
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,150
people just angry,

45
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,020
just want to fight the fight,

46
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,810
you can just sign up that week and fight.

47
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,390
So we get a ton of fights.

48
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,041
No Commission,

49
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,820
no commission.

50
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,653
Oh,

51
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,800
so it's a manly place that Montana.

52
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,640
Yeah,

53
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,121
it is.

54
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,811
It's quite manly.

55
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:20,991
I mean,

56
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,370
you guys have grizzly bears and shit.

57
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
Lots of grizzly bears,

58
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:25,394
wolves.

59
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,060
You know,

60
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,661
I was there,

61
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:26,930
uh,

62
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,880
two summers ago I went and just was like,

63
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:29,743
man,

64
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,940
I need to figure out a way
I spent more time here.

65
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,900
Wasn't Bozeman.

66
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,003
Oh yeah.

67
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,570
It's beautiful.

68
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,433
Oh yeah.

69
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,490
It's fucking stunning.

70
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:38,661
Yeah.

71
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,494
I definitely want to,

72
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,560
I enjoy being away from there right
now just because I grew up there.

73
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,130
Right.

74
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,300
Being in Phoenix is like,

75
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:44,601
I wouldn't,

76
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,560
I don't want to be anywhere else.

77
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:46,430
I love being in Phoenix.

78
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:47,930
The training there is insane.

79
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,921
Yeah.

80
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:49,401
Where we're at.

81
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,200
Phoenix is like the fucking Mecca man.

82
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,500
Like we get a train without
Gusto Mendez to Keanio every day.

83
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,150
Like he beat Hoffa Mendez.

84
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,040
He beat Cabrina.

85
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,950
He'd be Ryan Hall.

86
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,350
He's,

87
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,730
yeah.

88
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,720
He all these people and almost every mile
there's a really good gym like boxing,

89
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:02,931
Gym,

90
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:03,320
Jujitsu,

91
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,591
gym,

92
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,041
wrestling.

93
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,480
Jim Henry Cejudo has a club.

94
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,480
They're the MMA lab.

95
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,071
A junk crowds.

96
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,620
Like where we trained killers everywhere.

97
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,071
Yeah.

98
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:11,960
That's one of the best
spots in the world for sure.

99
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,090
Phoenix is a,

100
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,200
there's a few hotbeds for MMA.

101
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,610
Obviously la is a big one.

102
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,930
Miami a big one.

103
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,910
Phoenix is a fucking huge one too though.

104
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,261
Yeah.

105
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:21,741
The lab,

106
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,630
like it's,

107
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,220
it's a different type of gym
than a lot of other gyms.

108
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:28,550
I haven't seen many gyms
like stay together and I
think a big reason is because

109
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:29,181
of John Crouch.

110
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,130
He's like one of the best
facilitators out there.

111
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:32,330
He keeps everyone together.

112
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,830
If you don't show up to practice,

113
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,521
he'll text you and say,

114
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:34,671
Hey,

115
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,151
where are you at?

116
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,500
We got to get our priorities straight.

117
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:39,830
And he really holds everyone accountable
and I think that's why it makes it a

118
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:40,371
really good,

119
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,150
strong place.

120
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,301
Yeah.

121
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,500
He's one of my favorite coaches.

122
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,310
He's a,

123
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,920
he's just a super no nonsense guy.

124
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,360
Never blows his own horn,

125
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:51,920
not looking for any attention
and absolutely knows his shit.

126
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,270
Like when you hear him in the corner,

127
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,440
he knows his shit.

128
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:54,921
Yeah.

129
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:56,180
He's good to have there in the corner,

130
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:56,421
man.

131
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:57,410
He just,

132
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,040
uh,

133
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,100
be the leader kind of
everything and look over

134
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,611
everything.

135
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:05,611
And like he brought up Benson from
when he was a small like just starting.

136
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,490
So it's like we're lucky to be able
to learn after that and then be around

137
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,241
Benson in the room.

138
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:10,690
Like the,

139
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,100
he's got a work ethic like no other
like is no other joining the military.

140
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,580
I heard he was thinking about joining
the military I think is too old now.

141
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,330
Izzy.

142
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:19,840
Yeah,

143
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,210
I dunno,

144
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,043
I was too old five.

145
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,060
I heard about that too.

146
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,983
How old?

147
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,040
What is the limit?

148
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,010
I thought you could join the
military like up to like 36 or so.

149
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:31,060
Like once you get across a certain age
they have to make an exception for you.

150
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,620
You'd make that exception.

151
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,541
He's an animal.

152
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,374
Can Beast.

153
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,300
Yeah.

154
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,540
So we're lucky to be around him.

155
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:42,070
Like the work ethic he brings in the
rooms like no other like two and two

156
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:42,881
wrestling drilling.

157
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:43,010
I,

158
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,130
I feel like he'd break
any man on this planet.

159
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,720
She put the pace on you and it's,

160
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,930
it's pretty cool to learn from.

161
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,110
We're lucky to see it every day.

162
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:50,821
Yeah,

163
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:53,030
I mean that is one of
the most important quote.

164
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,340
Like there's a bunch of
important qualities in a fighter,

165
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,060
right?

166
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,630
Um,

167
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,400
being able to perform under pressure,

168
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,180
uh,

169
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,040
creativity.

170
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,830
Creativity's be,

171
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,870
I think that's one of the
places that you excel.

172
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,030
You really excel in creativity.

173
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,860
Like when I watched you fight like this,

174
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,440
kids fucking around out
there like you're having fun,

175
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:11,520
you're flowing.

176
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,821
You know,

177
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:15,450
when you were telling me today where
we're doing a little practicing,

178
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,300
you were saying that you were doing some
stuff in fights where you just thought

179
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,021
of it like,

180
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:19,741
why you're doing it.

181
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:20,730
It just felt like doing it.

182
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,920
Like there's people that can do that and
there's people that never do that right

183
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,980
now when they're in the fight,

184
00:04:25,981 --> 00:04:28,800
they're tightened up and they're fucking
sticking to the script and maybe even

185
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,110
sticking to like the real basics,

186
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,680
you know,

187
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,170
like barely even speaking in sentences.

188
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,370
Right.

189
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,690
I don't even think a lot of people
think too much when they're in there.

190
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:37,530
It's easier to say.

191
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,611
Um,

192
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,421
I feel like when I'm in there,

193
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:40,230
I'm reacting.

194
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,010
I'm letting my,

195
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,740
letting them all my training takeover.

196
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,741
I'm not really thinking,

197
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,540
I'm just reacting to what they're doing.

198
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:50,541
And I think that it helps me do what I've
been doing is just reacting to certain

199
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:51,744
situations and

200
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,190
I just feel like I'm on
a step ahead of them.

201
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,151
Whoever I'm fighting,

202
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,350
I feel like I'm a step ahead of them.

203
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,670
He's really good at like,

204
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,200
the greater the chaos,

205
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,340
the calmer he becomes.

206
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:02,860
And that's the,

207
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,511
that's the truth.

208
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:03,901
The bigger,

209
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,040
the brighter the lights are,

210
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,320
the more he shining and completely calm.

211
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,120
And before that last fight against,

212
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:09,600
uh,

213
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,433
Andre,

214
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,430
we watched probably four of Connor's
fights right before we walked to the Reno

215
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,420
and sugar sitting there,

216
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:16,860
zoning in on those fights,

217
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:18,090
watching the way he walks out,

218
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:19,830
watching the way he's
good with his energy,

219
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,330
smart with his energy.

220
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,110
And uh,

221
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,200
you can really see it in the fight the
way he may make some and sugar can watch

222
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:25,950
someone,

223
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,960
someone do something and
he can do it right away.

224
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,220
It's a really cool talent.

225
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,461
Yeah.

226
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:30,990
Before the last couple of fights,

227
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,621
um,

228
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:32,760
before we go to the arena,

229
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,930
we just don't fight pass.

230
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:34,471
Watch Conor,

231
00:05:34,471 --> 00:05:35,400
watch them walk out,

232
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,623
watch,

233
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,500
just watch him,

234
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,670
his body language,

235
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,523
Connors,

236
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,180
he's the man I love.

237
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,710
Gone or I've always loved Konner since,

238
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,780
since I remember watching
his first fight against,

239
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,441
what was the first,

240
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:47,740
like Max Holloway was at his first one.

241
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,610
UFC and the UFC.

242
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:48,930
Yeah.

243
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,920
I remember watching him and like,

244
00:05:49,921 --> 00:05:51,090
that dude is going to be good.

245
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,520
I think that was his first fight.

246
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:54,740
He blew his ACL out in that fight.

247
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:55,800
Maybe that wasn't as first.

248
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,850
Maybe you think it was image?

249
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,640
No,

250
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,040
might've been

251
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,730
Marcus perimeter.

252
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,020
Right?

253
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,570
Yeah,

254
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,310
yeah,

255
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,490
yeah.

256
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,100
I stopped.

257
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,200
He stopped image and then he blew his ACL.

258
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:03,291
Ah,

259
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,780
I want to say in the first
round against Holloway.

260
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,840
And then he started controlling them
on the ground and taking them down.

261
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,120
But that was a very
young Max Holloway too.

262
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,340
You know,

263
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,440
you're dealing with Holloway when,

264
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,820
I think he was like 20 or something.

265
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,200
He was young.

266
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,410
Yeah.

267
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,831
Super,

268
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,131
super.

269
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:16,911
Yet be,

270
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,481
fuck.

271
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
He's a beast.

272
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,190
He's cool.

273
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,150
He came down to the lab once.

274
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:20,450
I didn't,

275
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,830
we just kind of play around spar,

276
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:22,664
but he,

277
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm,

278
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,541
I'm excited for that.

279
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,280
He's fighting Ortega next July 7th.

280
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,114
Yes.

281
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,601
Very,

282
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:26,691
uh,

283
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:28,520
very excited about that
hope and I get to get,

284
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,121
get in there.

285
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:30,020
I hope we can get them tickets.

286
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:30,650
That's going to be sweet.

287
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,100
Yeah,

288
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,311
dude,

289
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,090
I'll hook you up.

290
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,541
He's,

291
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:34,070
he's fascinating to me.

292
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,670
Uh,

293
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,980
Max because he's just this guy that like,

294
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,670
I knew he was really good and the knees
kept getting better and kept getting

295
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:40,790
better.

296
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:40,971
I'm like,

297
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:42,260
where's the ceiling on this guy?

298
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,850
And then you saw in the Aldo fight when
he beat all of the first time and then

299
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:47,750
the second time,

300
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,650
the second time you're like,

301
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,870
Jesus Christ like you,

302
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:51,220
you,

303
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,870
you really don't know how good a guy is.

304
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,730
Like you see them in a fight and go,

305
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:55,941
wow,

306
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,840
he's really good.

307
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,790
But then you don't see him
for a while and you're like,

308
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,690
is he better?

309
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,890
Has He slipped?

310
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,551
Is He,

311
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,380
is he training hard?

312
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,141
Like where is he at?

313
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,880
Like you don't know
until you see him again.

314
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,310
And then when I saw him in that
second Aldo fight him like,

315
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,121
Jesus,

316
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,700
he's so much better than he was before he,

317
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,710
he yelled at the end of the first round,

318
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,510
he looked over at us and he goes,

319
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,950
demands tired.

320
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,840
Like at the end of the first round,

321
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,171
I was like,

322
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,070
Jesus,

323
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,010
he was in and all though
was throwing bricks at him.

324
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,240
He was really throwing hard in that
first round to try to like establish some

325
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:27,320
distance at all.

326
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,640
He hit him with some shots,

327
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,240
but he,

328
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,571
I mean,

329
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,100
he had his heartbeat and rock them.

330
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,203
You know,

331
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,223
Max lost.

332
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,460
He's only lot,

333
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:35,660
well in the UFC,

334
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,820
he lost to Dennis Bermudez caught
somewhere early in his career.

335
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,331
He lost it.

336
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,164
Connor,

337
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,530
I think he only has two or
three losses in his career.

338
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,251
Three there.

339
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,084
Three losses.

340
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,760
Who are they to does it say and Dustin,

341
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Dustin,

342
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:51,760
Dustin,

343
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,040
Dustin,

344
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,430
one 2012 oh,

345
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,050
okay,

346
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,770
good.

347
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,080
I love watching him fight
that fight against catchy.

348
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:57,680
I was,

349
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,550
I watched it live.

350
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,070
That was,

351
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,361
whew.

352
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,050
That was crazy.

353
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,883
He's a good,

354
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,900
I thought that was kind of going how,

355
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,661
how that was going to go.

356
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:06,350
He's going to outbox and he
was down some good combos.

357
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,630
Justin's leg kicks are a motherfucker,

358
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,890
but he takes too many shots.

359
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,401
He's just,

360
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:14,720
he's so intent on breaking people and
just keeping that pressure on you that,

361
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,441
I mean,

362
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:18,860
he's a fucking really good wrestler
and you never see any of it.

363
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,700
And his fights,

364
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,420
I think he posted something that he's
going to kind of switch up to say that.

365
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,691
Yeah,

366
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,231
I think he did.

367
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,090
But then he also said he might only
have five more fights left if he keeps

368
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:27,963
fights that way.

369
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,060
Yeah.

370
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,930
I mean he's just,

371
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,870
he's just fucking chaos.

372
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,411
It's just,

373
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,310
he's a Berserker,

374
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,090
but it's so fun to watch him.

375
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,250
It's like you don't
want to say anything to,

376
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,230
I'm pure entertainment.

377
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,630
No,

378
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,230
I mean,

379
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,771
fuck yeah,

380
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,170
he's the Eddie Alvarez fight
and the Dustin Poirier fight,

381
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:47,270
but they're so similar in a way that he
like almost gets the guy with his leg

382
00:08:47,271 --> 00:08:47,950
kicks hall.

383
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,650
Most breaks him with those leg
kicks and then he got caught.

384
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,450
But it worked in the
Michael Johnson fight.

385
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,290
So it's like when you see it
in the Michael Johnson fight,

386
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,170
when you see like Johnson's
leg just starting to give out.

387
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,710
We watched Luis Watch file fight,

388
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,010
Luis Palomino in a
elephant with another fe.

389
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
It was a world series.

390
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,063
We watched that.

391
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,920
He's gnarly to watch live and he
kicks low from real close man.

392
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,300
Generates a lot of power.

393
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,550
Yeah.

394
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,110
He's like,

395
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,920
he literally tying up with you and
he's chopping down with low kicks.

396
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:19,020
He's got real loose hips with that,

397
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:19,710
you know,

398
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,680
he's able to really bend
his body and chopped down.

399
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,011
Nice,

400
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:23,950
tight high garden.

401
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,181
Wait,

402
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:25,014
let me come in.

403
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,910
He fucks people's legs up,

404
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:27,270
man.

405
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,470
He does Telford Shit.

406
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:29,940
It's crazy when you see guys like that,

407
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,010
like when they start to get beat,

408
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,090
you wonder if they're going to start,

409
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,690
use those losses as
informative or demoralizing.

410
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,450
Start to define themselves and
then start questioning themselves.

411
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:42,030
That's why with sugar in
training and in a fight,

412
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,021
even in training,

413
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,840
like he'll find the toughest guys to go
with and he won't go with those guys and

414
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:46,021
be like,

415
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:46,201
oh,

416
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:46,770
they're better than me.

417
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,730
And started to find himself.

418
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:50,400
We'll just use it as
informative and learn from it.

419
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,210
So it's like,

420
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,410
it's another good mentality.

421
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:53,790
He's has super positive,

422
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:57,120
good mentality and I think a lot of that
comes from eating good and having the

423
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:57,751
right rest.

424
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:00,000
And hydrating and eating good year round,

425
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,340
not just eating good during
a fight camps and blowing up.

426
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,810
And I think that's a lot
to do with it for sure.

427
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,940
Even the lifestyle,

428
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,110
just eating healthy,

429
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:07,921
like you said,

430
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,641
all year round,

431
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:12,510
not just getting healthy for six weeks
and then eating like shit after getting

432
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,180
injured.

433
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,500
Once I really started
learning about eating healthy,

434
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,320
a ton of small little injuries went away.

435
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,650
My back would hurt every morning cause
that what you're doing wrong before like

436
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,484
what were you eating?

437
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,593
Pop tarts,

438
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,880
sugar can just anything shitty.

439
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:27,391
I don't know.

440
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:28,200
Hot pockets,

441
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
top ramen and any,

442
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,490
all that stuff that was
just raised eating and all.

443
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,290
And then once I started realizing what
that stuff's doing to my body and how I

444
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,124
can feel it,

445
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,931
it changed.

446
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,280
It changed my whole mindset.

447
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Like eating healthy was one of the biggest
things that improved my skills as a

448
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:45,751
fighter.

449
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:48,630
I feel like just as far
as my mental thoughts,

450
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,583
um,

451
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,900
my training sessions were so much better.

452
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,090
Will you just say in the
eat a lot of sardines?

453
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,660
No,

454
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,510
I said I had some sardines last night
and then I had some this morning.

455
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,550
That has a very good food.

456
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,870
They're not.

457
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,051
No,

458
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:01,441
they are.

459
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:01,710
Yeah,

460
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,011
dude,

461
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,760
we're so,

462
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,210
so lucky to have the internet and podcasts
and be able to learn from guys like

463
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:06,810
you,

464
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,070
Dr Andy Galpin,

465
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:08,671
like Aubrey,

466
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,504
Marcus,

467
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,620
Tim Ferris,

468
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,030
like Chris Fresh.

469
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,450
You ever listen to some of the
episodes with Chris Kresser,

470
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,210
fantastic information,

471
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,130
fantastic information on nutrition.

472
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,311
You know,

473
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,450
I mean there's so many guys like that.

474
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:21,290
Rob Wolf,

475
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:21,831
you know,

476
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:26,210
so many people that are like at the
cutting edge of performance and diet.

477
00:11:26,211 --> 00:11:30,620
And Robb Wolf is interesting too because
he experiments himself on with his own

478
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:34,880
body quite a bit and it talks about an
online and he's getting really heavily

479
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,050
into Jujitsu right now.

480
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,310
And he does a lot.

481
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:37,711
I mean he's,

482
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:42,050
he's really interesting too because he
does a lot of ketogenic stuff but really

483
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:44,510
adds way more carbs on Jujitsu days.

484
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,470
And um,

485
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:48,460
I had Zack bitter on Zach one,

486
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,560
the uh,

487
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,940
what was the American record for 24 hours.

488
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,093
It's American record

489
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,140
for running 24 hours,

490
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,750
the most amount of miles in 24 hours.

491
00:11:59,320 --> 00:11:59,850
Um,

492
00:11:59,850 --> 00:11:59,990
he,

493
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,520
he's,

494
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:00,940
yeah,

495
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,140
he's a fucking beast.

496
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,770
And how many did he run and what does
he run like he ran 24 hours straight.

497
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,280
Yeah,

498
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,113
yeah,

499
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,740
yeah.

500
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,680
A full day of running.

501
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,570
That's what we're trying
to find the balance though.

502
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,231
Like we're eating,

503
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,330
but you don't want to do that
on days that we're not training.

504
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:14,164
We're doing,

505
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,400
we're trying to do Kido,

506
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,260
so we're just keep the
inflammation down in her body.

507
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,400
But it's bitter guy that
I was just gonna say he,

508
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,610
he's a full Kido guy.

509
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,150
He's,

510
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,470
he mostly eats meat,

511
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,660
but on days when he has,

512
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,380
there it is,

513
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,210
he broke the u s 100 mile record.

514
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:28,900
That's what it was.

515
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,420
Seven minutes per mile for 12 hours.

516
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,020
That's,

517
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,853
that's the record.

518
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,963
That's right.

519
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,620
What a bad ass.

520
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:35,741
Oh,

521
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:36,071
he's a,

522
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,040
he's a fucking savage.

523
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,510
Mental thoughts I run in.

524
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,840
I wonder if he's just in the now just go,

525
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,210
it's gotta be in a trance.

526
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,230
But um,

527
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:44,741
he,

528
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:46,330
on days where he's running,

529
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,370
he way ramps up his carbs.

530
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,001
So like,

531
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,211
you know,

532
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:53,110
the average person is trying to keep
their carbs within like 50 grams or 75

533
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:58,111
grams to stay Kito you've got to
recognize that for extreme requirements,

534
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,250
like physical activity
ramped that shit up.

535
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:00,721
So Rob,

536
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm just going to say that Rob Wolf is
really experimenting a lot with that.

537
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,020
It follow him on Instagram.

538
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,370
He's big up on that.

539
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,271
Yeah.

540
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:07,580
Like,

541
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,090
and we listened to a lot
of Ben Greenfield too,

542
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:10,481
so I was like,

543
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:11,071
fantastic.

544
00:13:11,071 --> 00:13:11,831
And we're not training,

545
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:12,910
we're listening to you guys.

546
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,700
It's like we're treating
you guys like a college,

547
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,900
like your guys is our college.

548
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,300
And then we're going to Jujitsu,

549
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,520
learn from Makino going to
learn from John Crouch and like,

550
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,180
I dunno,

551
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,740
I feel like we're on a really good track,

552
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,730
especially for sugar.

553
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,080
Now how do you guys know each other?

554
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:26,914
How'd you guys meet?

555
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,190
Ooh,

556
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,850
good story.

557
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,061
I,

558
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:28,840
uh,

559
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,800
I was going to commentate and with belt
or at the time and going back to Montana

560
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:37,270
to commentate for some fights and a
shotgun for Beltour fighting for them.

561
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Yeah.

562
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,070
And then I went to commentate some local
fights up there and I saw Sean and he

563
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,740
was says 18,

564
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,590
18 at the time.

565
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,101
And I saw him,

566
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:45,371
I was like,

567
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:45,611
damn,

568
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:47,030
I kid submitted a,

569
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,860
a wrestler and the first
round and I knew at his gym,

570
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,591
he doesn't rest it on.

571
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:51,760
My Kid's got some good talent.

572
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:53,830
So I invited him down after
I went up to him and I said,

573
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:54,664
hey dude,

574
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,460
you can stay on my couch for a little
bit and come check out the gym.

575
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,990
Kind of figured he wouldn't.

576
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,951
And I remember,

577
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:00,784
I remember the,

578
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,410
he told me that I was so jack,

579
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:02,951
cause I knew Tim,

580
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:03,760
I seen him on TV.

581
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
I didn't meet him personally,

582
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,700
but I've seen him on Bella
trees on the fight master show.

583
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:07,311
And uh,

584
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:09,280
after my fight I were at the sting bar,

585
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:09,881
like a local bar.

586
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,010
And he came up to me
and he offered me that.

587
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,521
I remember,

588
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,750
I think I called you the next day.

589
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,021
I'm like,

590
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,261
hey dude,

591
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:14,381
yeah,

592
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:15,214
I want to come down.

593
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,480
And we figured it out.

594
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,670
I think I came down a few weeks later,

595
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,480
months later,

596
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,731
I came,

597
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:20,680
not for 10 days,

598
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,600
and it was like one of the most,

599
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,170
the biggest ass wouldn't
have ever got in my life.

600
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,660
I remember when we were
driving from the airport,

601
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:29,191
he was talking,

602
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:29,411
he's like,

603
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:29,561
yeah,

604
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,550
I mean you were going to the top.

605
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,330
I'm like,

606
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,790
this kid has no idea what he's
about to get himself into.

607
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:34,960
Taking him to the pro practices,

608
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:35,471
all the people,

609
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:37,150
because as soon as you get on the team,

610
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,980
everyone fucking hammers on you.

611
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,300
The Hammer is on youth beat you,

612
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:42,520
they break you down mentally to
see if you're going to come back.

613
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,020
So I was,

614
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,080
I was there for a full week.

615
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,150
So Monday is striking it.

616
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:45,910
Tuesday at wrestling,

617
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,620
I literally did not know how to wrestle.

618
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,730
It didn't notice single leg was,

619
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:48,810
it,

620
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,130
didn't not know anything about wrestling.

621
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,830
Um,

622
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,663
I remember

623
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,190
a good group of people just want me bad.

624
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:56,024
I remember crying,

625
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,863
leaving practice,

626
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,400
running on high school to know nothing,

627
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,060
nothing.

628
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,690
And you,

629
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,560
what part of Montana?

630
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,760
You from a Helena.

631
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,630
The capital.

632
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,230
Um,

633
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,501
but yeah,

634
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,150
I never saw,

635
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,480
I boxed a little bit,

636
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,021
but I never,

637
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:06,771
never wrestled.

638
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:07,670
Didn't really grapple.

639
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,930
I remember I knew one arm,

640
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:11,480
I knew an armbar off my back is the only
thing I knew and that's what I caught

641
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,330
that wrestler and I,

642
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,250
I've got him in an arm bar.

643
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,300
I surprised I didn't even,

644
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,020
I was like,

645
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,471
Holy Shit,

646
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:16,460
I just did that.

647
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,270
But anyway,

648
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:17,810
came down,

649
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,550
got beat up bad for a week.

650
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,120
Um,

651
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,840
went back,

652
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,290
say,

653
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,520
went back to Montana,

654
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,780
um,

655
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,370
saved up $2,000,

656
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,690
packed my car,

657
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,890
drove down.

658
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,450
He was living with his
girlfriend at the time.

659
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,530
Um,

660
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,460
we stayed there for two weeks,

661
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,360
then we got an apartment.

662
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:32,991
Um,

663
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:33,211
and I,

664
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:35,240
I'd only known Tim a little bit,

665
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,420
but we got an apartment close to the lab
and I just literally went every single

666
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:41,960
day,

667
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,830
twice a day.

668
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,450
When he first showed up.

669
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:45,284
He like,

670
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,990
I was going to,

671
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,350
I smoked some weed in the
night and he was so taken back.

672
00:15:48,351 --> 00:15:48,711
He's like,

673
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:49,340
Holy Shit.

674
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
He looked up to me,

675
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,010
couldn't believe that I was doing that.

676
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:52,980
Drove you smoked weed.

677
00:15:52,981 --> 00:15:57,290
And my dad didn't find that the
detective in in Montana and I would just,

678
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,720
I was raised like weed,

679
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,593
not good,

680
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,220
not good.

681
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,460
Like that's what was going through mine.

682
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,390
I thought it was bad.

683
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:04,590
Like really bad about it.

684
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,061
Oh yeah.

685
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:05,894
I remember he came down

686
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,220
places that went backwards with wheat.

687
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,940
They had medical marijuana in
Montana and now they're removing it.

688
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:13,500
They're removing all the stores.

689
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:14,251
When I was there,

690
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:15,084
they were like,

691
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,180
they were having some sort of a
closeout sale cause they were,

692
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:19,320
they were getting shut down.

693
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:21,810
I don't know if that's
since been amended or fixed.

694
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,720
I don't know.

695
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
That's what sucks.

696
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,413
Died.

697
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,540
And when he,

698
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,373
when he moved in,

699
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,243
when he moved in,

700
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:27,941
I was like,

701
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:28,774
okay,

702
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,400
this kid is fucking pissing me off.

703
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:31,630
He's not picking up his shit.

704
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,040
He'd not not doing his dishes.

705
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,320
He eats like mom did all
that for me and I'm like,

706
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,070
okay.

707
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,780
I either could get pissed
off and kick them out,

708
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:38,680
but then I realize I'm like,

709
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:39,670
he doesn't even know.

710
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,421
He doesn't even know.

711
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:41,171
So I'm going to work them.

712
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:43,330
I'm going to try to treat him like
my little brother and help him.

713
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,480
And he was willing to
like kind of follow along.

714
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,700
And then he started slowly
starting to eat better,

715
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,490
started eat spinach and his
back problem started to go away.

716
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,653
And um,

717
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,910
what kind of backpack on
my back would always hurt.

718
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,960
Always inflamed,

719
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,411
always.

720
00:16:56,411 --> 00:16:57,310
I don't know what it was.

721
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:58,140
I just,

722
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,120
all time I remember getting
it looked at my lower,

723
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,660
lower back.

724
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,050
It was,

725
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,351
it was,

726
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:02,861
it was nothing.

727
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,690
It was literally from eating shitty food.

728
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,690
It's just all the inflammation from
all the shitty food I was eating.

729
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,800
And I didn't know that at the time.

730
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:09,940
I remember my mom took me in there,

731
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,380
like up beer back's fine,

732
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,720
but it hurts so bad always.

733
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,700
I started eating more anti inflammatories.

734
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,060
I started making shakes with spinach
and almond milk and blueberries and Chia

735
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:19,480
seeds.

736
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,300
I started eating healthier
and I'd slowly notice like,

737
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:22,451
oh,

738
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:22,931
I feel better.

739
00:17:22,931 --> 00:17:23,291
I started.

740
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,210
So I started getting more
into eating healthier.

741
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,190
I remember just recently,

742
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:28,090
um,

743
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,920
I had a Vegan diet for six months and the
people on Instagram hate me now that I

744
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,270
don't eat vegan diet anymore.

745
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,750
You go off Vegan diet man.

746
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,550
That's like when you
become a Muslim apostate.

747
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,384
Seriously.

748
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,550
They want death to you.

749
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,021
Yeah.

750
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:44,420
Cause I've been posting pictures
like I posted a picture of,

751
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,500
I got this um,

752
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,510
grassfed beef jerky for
whole foods yesterday.

753
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,830
Got Probably 30,

754
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:49,650
40.

755
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,670
Why aren't you vegan anymore?

756
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,380
Or just meet like people though?

757
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:52,710
They,

758
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,020
they're mad at me for not
eating a Vegan diet anymore.

759
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,030
But I would say like,

760
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,530
I hate that Vegan diet for six months,

761
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,011
but I did,

762
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,900
I incorporated eggs and do
it cause I just couldn't,

763
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,100
I wasn't eating enough.

764
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,181
But I never,

765
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,170
I never felt bad.

766
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,010
I didn't feel worse.

767
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,930
I just didn't feel great.

768
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,560
Once I started eating good quality
meeting and I felt my energy levels,

769
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,480
I'd wake up on,

770
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,290
my energy levels were way higher.

771
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,030
I just felt more aggressive.

772
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,830
I felt more like manly.

773
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,280
Um,

774
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,590
so if he comes right now,

775
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,250
get getting angry in the content against,

776
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,430
in the contenders.

777
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,840
I know you lost me.

778
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,070
The contender series fight,

779
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,810
he weighed 138 pounds.

780
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:28,890
He was a Vegan at that time.

781
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,880
I walk sick,

782
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,380
lease dislike skinny.

783
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,130
There's more to that too
than than just the beginning.

784
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,110
I had a concussion,

785
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,280
a bad concussion.

786
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,160
Three weeks out from that fight
against Alfred and the tender series.

787
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,320
I remember waking up in
the middle night puking.

788
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:40,741
Um,

789
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:41,574
I couldn't train.

790
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,870
Um,

791
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,270
I remember I even woke up with a
little headache going into the fight.

792
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,260
Do you remember it was from,

793
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:47,940
um,

794
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,161
yeah,

795
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,200
well I was from sparring.

796
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,131
I hit hard,

797
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:50,341
boom.

798
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:50,940
And I remembered,

799
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,960
I'm like fuck.

800
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,390
But I knew it was the huge opportunity.

801
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,500
Um,

802
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,550
I like the matchup.

803
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,590
I knew I just had to go
out there and perform.

804
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:58,801
But yeah,

805
00:18:58,801 --> 00:18:59,430
I was,

806
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,150
I weighed in at one 36 and I walked
into the cage at one 38 like I was,

807
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,601
it was,

808
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,261
and you can even look,

809
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:04,640
go by,

810
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:04,980
look,

811
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,970
go back and look at that video.

812
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,530
And it looked just unhealthy,

813
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,420
but it all works.

814
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:09,601
Yeah.

815
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:09,900
I just,

816
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,160
I was so skinny.

817
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,990
I was like 138 pounds right there.

818
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:13,740
Yeah,

819
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,880
I still dropped his ass.

820
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,753
Then

821
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,470
two weeks later we went to
to hang out with her buddy,

822
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:23,550
a Scott Holtzman in the UFC for a UFC
Fresno and a Dr Andy Galpin was with him

823
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:25,650
for the week and I knew sugar was with me.

824
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:28,860
He watched what the health and
that's what turned him Vegan.

825
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:30,930
So I made sure to ask doctor
handy in front of sugar.

826
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:31,171
I said,

827
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:36,171
how much would Sean benefit from eating
like elk or a grass fed meat twice a

828
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:37,201
week.

829
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:38,550
He's like fucking hugely,

830
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,301
hugely.

831
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,770
And then Sean right there
and made the decision,

832
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:42,810
I'm going to start making
some guys tell him if this,

833
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,670
if he's this smart and he's telling me
that some good quality meats going to

834
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:48,540
benefit me,

835
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,270
I would be stupid to not
take him up on that and,

836
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,181
and do that.

837
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:54,690
So,

838
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:55,411
and I don't regret it.

839
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,730
I feel so good eating meat again,

840
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,630
I feel way stronger.

841
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,050
It's hard when you see those documentary
and also you get a lot of positive

842
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:03,930
reinforcement from other vegans that
are very happy that you're Vegan.

843
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,260
Yeah,

844
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,180
they'd love that you
joined the team and look,

845
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,690
people want to be healthy
and for the most part,

846
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,490
eating vegetables is very healthy.

847
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:12,340
The problem is we,

848
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:16,080
there's a lot of nutrients that you're
gonna really have to search for if you're

849
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,360
just eating plants and it's,

850
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:20,430
the protein is not as bioavailable.

851
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,650
The amino acids are not as bioavailable.

852
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,320
It's very hard to get vitamin
B without supplementation.

853
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,580
There's a lot of shit that you're just
not going to get and they like bang for

854
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:33,990
your buck in terms of what the amount of
nutrients that you get in like a small

855
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,900
grass fed steak versus
a big plate of Broccoli.

856
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,660
It's just not the same and
they don't want to admit it.

857
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,520
And a lot of these feelings,

858
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:40,681
those,

859
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:42,120
I think those what the health guys,

860
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:45,900
I had the mom when they did Cowspiracy
I think they mean well but they are

861
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:47,860
fucking true believers and they,

862
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,660
they are not trying to put together a
documentary that states all the facts.

863
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,350
Objective Lee,

864
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,350
they're doing a vegan propaganda film
and on it debunked a shit load of the

865
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,231
things.

866
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:04,000
We had an actual nutritionists
analyze what they were saying,

867
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,660
go over the studies and they debunked a
shit load of what they put in that film.

868
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,260
That film is propaganda film and it gets
a lot of people thinking that this is

869
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:11,791
the way to go.

870
00:21:11,791 --> 00:21:14,230
It's going to reverse heart
disease and help your body and,

871
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,030
but they get so many things wrong deep
into the meat does not cause diabetes.

872
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,630
Like this is nonsense like that when
they do these studies with people,

873
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,050
especially like um,

874
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,870
studies that they do on people that
show that people that eat meat more than

875
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,510
five times a week have a higher
incidence of heart disease and all these

876
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:32,200
different things.

877
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,210
They don't measure what else they eat.

878
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,410
These people that are eating meat all
the time or eating fries and shakes and

879
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:43,411
soda and you're not analyzing someone who
eats sauteed spinach and olive oil and

880
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:49,210
a piece of grass fed beef or bison
or elk or something like that.

881
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:49,541
No,

882
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:49,751
you're,

883
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,150
you're getting some assholes
eating Jack in the box.

884
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:52,691
Like,

885
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:52,901
yeah,

886
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:54,070
that stuff's terrible for you.

887
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:58,900
It's fucking sugar and refined
carbohydrates and nonsense and trans fats.

888
00:21:59,130 --> 00:21:59,231
Oh,

889
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,250
that's those terrible for you.

890
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:00,880
If there's,

891
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
there's no studies that show that
eating clean like people have eaten for

892
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:05,500
thousands of years.

893
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,070
I mean,

894
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,840
literally if me caused cancer,

895
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,350
97% of the planet would
have cancer and that's,

896
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,770
that's the numbers that eat
meat on a regular basis.

897
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,080
It's like 95 plus percent.

898
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,830
Fuck.

899
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,420
And then those people
like that are vegans.

900
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,690
They're like,

901
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:19,791
oh,

902
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:20,980
I'm going to try a Vegan Diet.

903
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,510
And they're eating all these veggies,

904
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,370
getting these nutrients that they
didn't get before and they're like,

905
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,520
I feel fucking kid off that bullshit diet.

906
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:31,120
He stopped beating Jack the Box Star Jack
in the box in the middle of the night.

907
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,040
Sometimes I do go to,

908
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,980
as for comfort,

909
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,030
it's not Jack [inaudible],

910
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,280
he's just fast food,

911
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:37,061
shitty food,

912
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,020
processed food,

913
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,560
you know?

914
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,760
That's what the problem is.

915
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,481
It's like people,

916
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,860
like you're saying like ramen.

917
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,360
I like ramen every now and then.

918
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,871
Fuck,

919
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:44,704
it tastes good,

920
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,000
but it's not good for you.

921
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,660
I couldn't eat.

922
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,080
Yeah.

923
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,400
It's just like knowing what that,

924
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,920
what that what it does do your by
knowing that you are what you eat,

925
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:52,271
it's high.

926
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,104
Can't,

927
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,220
I can't cheat.

928
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,091
I can't do it.

929
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:55,691
If I have no,

930
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,280
that's not going to benefit my body.

931
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,090
I can't eat it.

932
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,750
It's hard.

933
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,450
What you eat like 100% and I so simple.

934
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,050
You know,

935
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:02,883
it's such a simple,

936
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,240
it's such a simple phrase,

937
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,540
but literally your body is
made out of what you eat,

938
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,620
not mouth.

939
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,453
Pleasure,

940
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,393
pleasure,

941
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,670
God damn man.

942
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,860
Ice Cream Sundae with hot fudge.

943
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,053
That's good.

944
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,420
But there's so many.

945
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,110
There's all these healthy you can,

946
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,840
you can replace all of
that with healthy stuff.

947
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,460
I haven't had any Quito ice cream,

948
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:25,420
but I've heard good things.

949
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Some people said that there
are some Stevia sweetened
or Xylitol sweetened Quito

950
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:31,171
ice cream.

951
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,230
It doesn't fuck with your body.

952
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:32,651
Nice.

953
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:36,430
That new halo top man has that coconut
sweetened coconut milk and Stevia.

954
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,060
That's pretty tasty.

955
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,750
Yeah,

956
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,201
well there's,

957
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,820
there's stuff that you
can eat that is good.

958
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:40,660
And of course fruit,

959
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,081
you know,

960
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:42,130
eating healthy fruit.

961
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:42,520
I mean,

962
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,240
look man,

963
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,811
a nice,

964
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:48,350
delicious ripe peach is about
as fucking good as any bullshit.

965
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,710
Fucking fake dessert you're
going to get anywhere.

966
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,000
We don't appreciate it because we think
of it as being like a healthy choice.

967
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,630
So it doesn't,

968
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,470
you don't get that I'm being a
naughty boy reward that you get from,

969
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,980
you know,

970
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,480
having a banana split or something.

971
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,730
Fuck God.

972
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,160
It's just not worth it might asleep up.

973
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,670
Yup.

974
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,080
It fucks your blood sugar up.

975
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:09,680
And that's the thing.

976
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,050
It's crazy that most people don't know.

977
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:12,711
They're like,

978
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:13,011
God,

979
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,830
I just eat and I'm tired and
then I just get started again.

980
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,870
They just don't know about
those blood sugar fucking,

981
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,321
yeah.

982
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:19,340
The insulin spikes.

983
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,530
And I had a regular coke the other day,

984
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,980
like a couple weeks ago for
the first time in years.

985
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:25,843
How calm,

986
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,511
oh,

987
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,860
just whatever it was there.

988
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,330
So I haven't had a coke in forever.

989
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:30,164
Let me have a coke.

990
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,190
And I was,

991
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,490
it was,

992
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,120
I was like,

993
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,710
it was like drinking
syrup like this sugary,

994
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,840
it was like felt thick when it was,

995
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,430
when I was chugging it down,

996
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,120
it was,

997
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,953
I was like,

998
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,450
no,

999
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:43,790
no.

1000
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:46,370
But I did feel like
shit after it was down.

1001
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:46,650
I was like,

1002
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,590
Ooh,

1003
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,710
I feel terrible.

1004
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,880
But how many people drink
those fucking things every day?

1005
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,063
Every day.

1006
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,540
42 at 34 ouncers or what
are the three towns?

1007
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,030
Pop.

1008
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:55,421
It's hard.

1009
00:24:55,421 --> 00:24:55,721
Yeah.

1010
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:58,360
It's hard cause it's a who
you're surrounded with to like,

1011
00:24:58,361 --> 00:24:58,931
fuck dude.

1012
00:24:58,931 --> 00:24:59,830
If you're surrounded with everyone,

1013
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,010
like,

1014
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,820
oh come on pussy.

1015
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
Just have a good time.

1016
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:02,230
Enjoy your life.

1017
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,063
You're like pocket.

1018
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,520
Right.

1019
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,060
And then you're like,

1020
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,820
exactly.

1021
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,090
That's,

1022
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,530
that's not like who you like,

1023
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,600
it's such a common thing.

1024
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,550
You are who you surround
yourself with but people don't,

1025
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:10,930
I dunno.

1026
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,820
It's like I'm so lucky that when
I was surrounded myself with Tim,

1027
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,220
like he introduced me to eating healthy.

1028
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,910
I remember when I was 19 I
moved to the lab every day.

1029
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,030
We have pro practice Monday,

1030
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Tuesday,

1031
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Wednesday,

1032
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Thursday,

1033
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,360
Saturday,

1034
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,230
every day I was going to the coffee shop
and reading mind gym books and meant

1035
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:31,760
not like all these mental books
and we're doing it together.

1036
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,690
We were reading constantly
improving each other,

1037
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:35,471
wanting to get better,

1038
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,850
want to do help each other improve.

1039
00:25:36,851 --> 00:25:37,780
And that's,

1040
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,250
it was so important for me to,

1041
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,670
you are who you surround yourself with
and I see people not surrounded with

1042
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:46,600
themselves with the best people
they can be around and to trap.

1043
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:46,991
Yeah,

1044
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:47,771
it's a terrible trap.

1045
00:25:47,771 --> 00:25:50,650
But sometimes those people that are not
the best people are really fun to be

1046
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:51,484
around the problem.

1047
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,660
That's a distraction.

1048
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:57,200
It's like what's keeping you back from
wanting to be the very like I want to be

1049
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,360
the best Bantam weight in the world.

1050
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,080
Like what's keeping you people back
from wanting to be the best of them and

1051
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,050
still just distractions.

1052
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:04,670
People who are fun to be around alcohol,

1053
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,121
you know,

1054
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:05,811
even women,

1055
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:06,621
like certain foods,

1056
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,650
like distractions of what's keeping you
back from wanting to be the best you.

1057
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,130
So it's just our brains are crazy.

1058
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,173
Our brains are not.

1059
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,040
Yeah,

1060
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,761
I mean just,

1061
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:18,400
well you got to think about
just what you do for a living.

1062
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,870
I mean just that alone is crazy,

1063
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:20,380
right?

1064
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,660
The desire to be a professional fighter,

1065
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:27,220
to desire to fucking kick people in the
head and choke them and have them try to

1066
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:27,761
do it to you.

1067
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:31,090
And this is what excites you and that
this is what's driving you to go to the

1068
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,980
gym to improve constantly at,

1069
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,671
I mean,

1070
00:26:33,671 --> 00:26:34,870
that alone is crazy,

1071
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,471
you know?

1072
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:40,060
And then these other people that are
living their lives and drinking too much

1073
00:26:40,061 --> 00:26:44,400
and smoking too much and eating
shitty foods and you know,

1074
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:44,731
they,

1075
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:45,750
that's their path.

1076
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,011
You know,

1077
00:26:46,011 --> 00:26:48,270
they're there but their path
is not compatible with your

1078
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,950
path.

1079
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,120
That's the big key.

1080
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,860
I like how Kyle Kingsbury said like,

1081
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:52,550
uh,

1082
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,730
like there's going to be some point in
your life that Health Jermaine priority.

1083
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:58,730
There's going to be some point when
you're old and you have a disease or it

1084
00:26:58,731 --> 00:26:59,331
could be now,

1085
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:03,410
but I was lucky enough to like when I
was 20 and 21 learning these things,

1086
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:06,170
I moved in with Robert Follis and got
to live with him for a while and I was

1087
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:06,381
like,

1088
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:07,190
damn,

1089
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,970
this motherfucker's got
bookshelves of books,

1090
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,990
super smart.

1091
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:12,351
And I'm like,

1092
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:13,161
why is he eating all that?

1093
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:14,550
Why does it go to this trader Joe's place?

1094
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,190
So I started going to
trader Joe's and I'm like,

1095
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,450
Robert Falls would always say,

1096
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:18,110
he's like,

1097
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,280
how much do you train your mind?

1098
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,320
We train Jujitsu,

1099
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:20,901
train wrestling,

1100
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:21,531
we train all of this.

1101
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,450
How much do you just sit
there and train your mind?

1102
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,351
And I was like,

1103
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,010
fuck.

1104
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,100
So I just started reading books and
started reading about eating healthy and

1105
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,950
super lucky to learn
and be around that guy.

1106
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:33,500
He was probably one of the biggest
influences in my life because I was raised

1107
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,530
Jehovah's witness my whole life and he
was raised Jehovah's witness his whole

1108
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:41,060
life and I carried a lot of fucking
guilt for not being in the like religion

1109
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:41,391
slash,

1110
00:27:41,391 --> 00:27:42,080
cult.

1111
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,621
And he's like,

1112
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:42,891
dude,

1113
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:44,720
you're not a good person
because of that religion.

1114
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,261
He's like,

1115
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,480
you're a good person cause
you're a fucking good person.

1116
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,810
And then just started telling me
to read and do your own research.

1117
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:51,680
Don't listen to these people,

1118
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:52,970
do your own fucking research.

1119
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,850
Learned a lot from that guy and that
they've got to pass it on to sugar.

1120
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,930
He was a gem.

1121
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:57,861
I really,

1122
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:58,730
really loved that guy.

1123
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,570
Such a great guy to be around.

1124
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,201
I mean,

1125
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,130
I didn't know him enough.

1126
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:02,820
W you know,

1127
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,870
really when he died,

1128
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:04,920
it bummed me out so much.

1129
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:05,250
It was like,

1130
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,881
God damn,

1131
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:07,340
I should've spent more time with that guy.

1132
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,370
Isn't that crazy?

1133
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,240
It was the only got to meet him.

1134
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:10,950
I only met him like three or four times,

1135
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,270
but every time I was
around him I was like,

1136
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,620
it was cool because he taught
him so much and I get to learn.

1137
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,570
I'd seen like that's where
he learned it all from it.

1138
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,020
Like Robert's a smart dude.

1139
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:19,561
Yeah.

1140
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,394
That's good.

1141
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,020
Bummer.

1142
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,360
You know a guy like that would
want to end his own life.

1143
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:27,830
Like how is that possible that
someone was so loved and respected and

1144
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,693
appreciated?

1145
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,230
It really just highlights,

1146
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,011
you know,

1147
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:31,520
the,

1148
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:31,970
the,

1149
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,480
the real issues that people who have
mental illness and depression are going

1150
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:35,841
through.

1151
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:36,051
You know,

1152
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:36,884
it's like it's not,

1153
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,960
it's not obvious to people on the outside.

1154
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,421
Yeah.

1155
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:40,400
And I think I know what someone's,

1156
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,290
you just never know how
someone's feeling or thing.

1157
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:42,600
You know,

1158
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,680
his brother committed suicide and I think
that's what made him start like maybe

1159
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,330
getting into pills or alcohol and stuff.

1160
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:51,990
But it was weird because he would always
be the one that the answer for you to

1161
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:52,650
wear your problems.

1162
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,730
You have the perfect answer,

1163
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,630
super intelligent.

1164
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,250
So it kind of freaked me out.

1165
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:56,521
I'm like,

1166
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:56,701
man,

1167
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:57,120
I want to,

1168
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,410
I want my life to be like that guy.

1169
00:28:58,411 --> 00:28:59,630
I want to be like him when I grow up.

1170
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,301
When that happened,

1171
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:00,750
I was like,

1172
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,590
fuck man,

1173
00:29:01,591 --> 00:29:02,424
I couldn't believe it.

1174
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,320
How did you get out of Jehovah's witness?

1175
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,310
Uh,

1176
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,260
my parents got divorced in eighth grade.

1177
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,150
My mom moved to Canada,

1178
00:29:08,151 --> 00:29:10,160
was still a Jehovah's Witness and uh,

1179
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,990
I lived with her for a while
and I just was super trapped,

1180
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:14,130
couldn't hang out with anyone,

1181
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,750
couldn't do any sports.

1182
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:16,861
And I was like,

1183
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:17,311
fuck,

1184
00:29:17,311 --> 00:29:18,450
I have to make a decision.

1185
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,000
Go with my dad and get out of the cult.

1186
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,260
And all the elders were like,

1187
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:22,831
don't do that.

1188
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:23,521
That's a mistake.

1189
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:24,121
That's a mistake.

1190
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:24,990
But I made decisions.

1191
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:25,771
They have elders too,

1192
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:27,490
just like the Mormons and I'm,

1193
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,880
and I made the decision I'm going to
go move with my dad and moved back to

1194
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,391
Montana.

1195
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:32,460
And then my dad was super into UFC,

1196
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,620
so I started wrestling
and boxing when I was 14.

1197
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,850
And then on from there,

1198
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:36,901
my,

1199
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:37,734
uh,

1200
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,753
one of my wife's,

1201
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,570
well,

1202
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,980
how do I put this without this person I

1203
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,450
know was a heavily into Mormonism and uh,

1204
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:46,880
they,

1205
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,800
they had people come over the house
that were elders and the kid was 20,

1206
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,091
and he was like,

1207
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:55,150
this is elder Mike and Mike
the fuck it is elder Mike.

1208
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:56,720
Well,

1209
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,230
he talking about elder 20.

1210
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,064
Dude,

1211
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,890
I'm like up there and get some pussy

1212
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,860
that it's so preposterous.

1213
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,694
You fucker.

1214
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,391
You know.

1215
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:07,781
And they were,

1216
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:08,230
um,

1217
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,100
they were going to other
countries as missionaries,

1218
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:16,960
getting these people and riding their
bike South America and you know,

1219
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,180
going up to him and send,

1220
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:18,720
Hey,

1221
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,150
yeah,

1222
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,983
come join the call.

1223
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,100
I remember my dad was
watching the UFC when I was,

1224
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,610
I had to have been 12 or 13 and I
thought it was the one I was like,

1225
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,400
I remember telling my
mom that he was watching.

1226
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:31,980
I told on him like that he's
watching two guys fight.

1227
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,540
I thought it was the craziest thing ever.

1228
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,111
I hated it.

1229
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:38,550
I did not like confrontation like 1213
years old and I remember literally

1230
00:30:38,551 --> 00:30:41,490
telling on him my dad
that he watching the UFC.

1231
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,160
It's funny looking back on that.

1232
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,300
That's hilarious.

1233
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:45,660
Yeah,

1234
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,140
it was funny.

1235
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,130
Remember who was fighting.

1236
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,741
I don't.

1237
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:48,610
I remember he,

1238
00:30:48,611 --> 00:30:51,640
I remember chuck and Tito and then Uriah,

1239
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:51,641
Uriah Faber.

1240
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,570
Those were the three guys.

1241
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:53,404
Like I remembered

1242
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,011
their names.

1243
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:54,550
Yeah.

1244
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,383
Yeah.

1245
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,220
Can you believe they're
going to fight again?

1246
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,990
Are they getting along again?

1247
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:00,910
Chuck and Tito are supposed
to be fighting again.

1248
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah.

1249
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,890
When this year and next thing he knows
it's for Oscar de la Hoya is burgeoning

1250
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:06,820
MMA promotion.

1251
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,170
Tell him you're not going to watch,

1252
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,400
so I will

1253
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,790
pay you.

1254
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,601
Fucking got me,

1255
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:13,901
man.

1256
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:14,620
You got me.

1257
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:14,921
I mean,

1258
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,240
I probably will have to watch.

1259
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,740
Didn't pick that up.

1260
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,240
I don't think Bella Tarr wants it.

1261
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,130
I think Bella tours cautious.

1262
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:21,701
You know,

1263
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,530
I know Bella tour was talking to chuck,

1264
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,390
but you know,

1265
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,160
I mean Dana White said it best is a
reason I asked him to retire 10 years ago,

1266
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,020
10 years ago.

1267
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:32,854
I mean,

1268
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,911
look man,

1269
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:34,601
there's a number here.

1270
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:34,901
It is.

1271
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:35,950
Tito Ortiz is announces,

1272
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:38,710
he's coming out of retirement for
Chuck Odell trilogy is that today,

1273
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,450
May 11th.

1274
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:40,720
So it's like,

1275
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:40,910
oh,

1276
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,743
okay.

1277
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,191
Yeah,

1278
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,240
it's happening man.

1279
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,173
It's happening.

1280
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,010
I wonder how their training
camp you're going to go,

1281
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,510
but they're going to be hurting,

1282
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:48,810
you know,

1283
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:49,810
a lot of Mris.

1284
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:50,981
Serious one,

1285
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:51,970
two sessions a week.

1286
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,801
Well,

1287
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:56,800
Tito is in remarkably good shape.

1288
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:57,550
Believe it or not,

1289
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:00,700
cause he's had a significant
number of back injuries,

1290
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,800
but other than the chocolate Dell fights,

1291
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:04,700
he really didn't take a lot of headshots.

1292
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,380
Yeah.

1293
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:05,910
You know,

1294
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,960
it didn't really take
a lot of head trauma.

1295
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,080
Yeah.

1296
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,470
Tito's a tough motherfucker,

1297
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,721
man.

1298
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:11,554
He's been,

1299
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,540
he's been around a long ass time.

1300
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,400
And when he fought chuck,

1301
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,730
the gap in striking was just so large.

1302
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,091
You know,

1303
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:20,020
Tito was always,

1304
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:20,630
uh,

1305
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,390
a competent striker.

1306
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,691
You know,

1307
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,840
he was a strong guy and a great
wrestler in his ground and pound,

1308
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:26,710
but some of the best,

1309
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,370
I mean,

1310
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,070
Tito was one of those guys never
bothered passing the guard.

1311
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:30,521
He was like,

1312
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,530
fuck you and fuck your guard.

1313
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:33,030
Teen quest.

1314
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,740
I'm going to get on top
of you and smash you.

1315
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:39,680
And there was nobody catching Tito Ortiz
and triangles get the fuck Outta here

1316
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,310
with that.

1317
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,470
You were getting elbowed
and punched in the face.

1318
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,910
He was phenomenal at that.

1319
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,750
But his standup could not hang with chuck.

1320
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,680
Chuck,

1321
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,240
when you think of chuck stand
up like it was never like,

1322
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,090
but it was beautiful and a lot of
ways because of the knock outs were

1323
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:56,811
spectacular,

1324
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:57,530
but it was,

1325
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:57,950
there was,

1326
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,210
it was not sneaky.

1327
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,290
You know what I'm saying?

1328
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,000
There was no artistry to it.

1329
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:07,001
There was no faints or swell is no like
Tj Dillashaw style movement or Dominick

1330
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,540
Cruz or it was just a tag viking.

1331
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,980
Ah,

1332
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,810
just smash people and skillful,

1333
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,651
don't get me wrong.

1334
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:19,161
It was a very,

1335
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,790
I mean,

1336
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:20,001
look,

1337
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:20,510
he,

1338
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,900
he fucked up a lot of really
good guys with solid technique,

1339
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,440
but it was just so overtly aggressive.

1340
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,670
Like his style was so aggressive that
that style just caught up with him.

1341
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,421
I mean,

1342
00:33:32,421 --> 00:33:32,991
he's got,

1343
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,610
he was in so many wars,

1344
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,300
man.

1345
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,780
I mean,

1346
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,240
just so many fucking crazy wars.

1347
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,500
It's weird the confidence,

1348
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,334
like you see like,

1349
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,660
it's so good.

1350
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,870
I feel like when someone knocks people
out early on in their career and they're

1351
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:45,021
like,

1352
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:45,854
oh shit man,

1353
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,330
I fucking touches guy.

1354
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:48,830
He's gonna fall sugars,

1355
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,530
knock someone out with
every limb on his body.

1356
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,400
So it's like,

1357
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,800
he knows he can touch this guy
with any limb and what they do,

1358
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,020
what they fucking fall over.

1359
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,060
And I think a lot of people
late in their career,

1360
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:00,360
they'd never knocked him out.

1361
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,970
They don't believe that at all.

1362
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:05,630
And I feel like you can see that big time
and fight or a wrestler knocks him out

1363
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:06,680
for the first time and then you're like,

1364
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,011
oh,

1365
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,440
addicted Johnny Hendricks style.

1366
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,041
Right.

1367
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:15,041
Well Hendrix for a while had
some magic power in his hands.

1368
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,550
It was weird,

1369
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,950
but it's weird is that it went away.

1370
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,450
It didn't make any sense.

1371
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:24,380
If you see like his fight with Martin
Kampmann or his fight with Fitch or a lot

1372
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:25,214
of the guys he fought,

1373
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:30,430
he would just fucking one touch these
guys and they would fly across the cage.

1374
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:32,480
Like he had magic in his hands.

1375
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:34,490
Luck Dude Hendricks for a while.

1376
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:34,611
Man,

1377
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:36,170
I don't know if he got injured,

1378
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,790
if his shoulder got fucked up,

1379
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:41,480
if he couldn't throw the way he used
to be able to throw whatever it was.

1380
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,400
You saw the whatever it was,

1381
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,061
whatever.

1382
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:44,870
Got them,

1383
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,681
whatever got them.

1384
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:48,770
He motivation time,

1385
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,850
just father time,

1386
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:50,684
whatever it was.

1387
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,460
But God damn it just went away and
then he became not a dangerous striker.

1388
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,800
It's so weird.

1389
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:57,771
Fucking weird.

1390
00:34:57,771 --> 00:35:01,430
And that's another thing like whether
it's Usada or whether they're using those

1391
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:01,980
losses.

1392
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,860
There's informative or demoralizing.

1393
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,191
Well,

1394
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:06,980
we all know everyone who has been around,

1395
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,220
Jim's knows things that
have not been published.

1396
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,290
We know people that have not been caught,

1397
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:17,090
but we've seen them dip significantly
when they had to go off a cycle because

1398
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,640
they're going to a place where they
were going to get tested regularly.

1399
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,510
We've all seen it.

1400
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,990
Yeah,

1401
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,591
and it's,

1402
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,450
these are stories that like you hesitate,

1403
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:28,130
like should the general public understand
what the real risks are because these

1404
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,420
fighters that go to,

1405
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,090
would you say you go to someplace
like rise in and they're like,

1406
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:32,480
hey,

1407
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,530
go crazy.

1408
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,190
We don't give a f.

1409
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,620
You want to give a fuck
old school pride go crazy.

1410
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,603
We don't give a fuck.

1411
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,130
But then

1412
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,660
when those guys come over and try to
compete in the UFC and the UFC is like,

1413
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,170
okay,

1414
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,640
fill out this paperwork.

1415
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:44,901
It gets,

1416
00:35:44,901 --> 00:35:45,151
you know,

1417
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:46,380
give us your whereabouts.

1418
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,450
You've got to sign in everywhere you go.

1419
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,690
And then they start showing up.

1420
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:52,620
When someone like Holly Holmes
had been tested like 19 times,

1421
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:53,581
they just show up.

1422
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:53,821
Knock,

1423
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:54,840
knock here.

1424
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,703
Time to pee.

1425
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,190
You know,

1426
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,510
let's,

1427
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,390
let's check your blood.

1428
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:58,710
Let's see what's going on in your body.

1429
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,060
I'll make sure you're not
doing anything stupid.

1430
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:00,271
All right,

1431
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:01,104
go back to sleep.

1432
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,250
I mean you,

1433
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:07,050
if you come from this place where
you're allowed to cheat basically,

1434
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:08,040
and you're doing it all the time,

1435
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,490
which we all know a lot of organizations,

1436
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:15,030
I'll allow that to happen and then
you could try to come over to the UFC.

1437
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,710
You're going to see depression,

1438
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,330
you're going to see lethargic,

1439
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,240
you're going to see people
that they're just there.

1440
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,200
They're in a dour mood all the time.

1441
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,280
They're always sad,

1442
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,870
their body's broken down.

1443
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,490
You see the,

1444
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,610
they shrink.

1445
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,740
You started seeing all this loose access,

1446
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:29,341
skin,

1447
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:30,174
their arms,

1448
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,100
they're not defined anymore.

1449
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,203
Fucking horrible,

1450
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,580
but they want to fight and they
want to make the money and you know,

1451
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:35,770
hey,

1452
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,980
it's his 30 and 30 if I win,

1453
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,341
you know what I mean?

1454
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:38,970
Money.

1455
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:39,130
Yeah.

1456
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,180
Maybe I can go to Guatemala and hideout,

1457
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,780
do deep ball for six weeks.

1458
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,830
I did a lot of fighters too.

1459
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,060
It's like what defines them?

1460
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:45,941
Yeah.

1461
00:36:45,941 --> 00:36:47,070
It's fucking what defines him.

1462
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:47,821
That's all they got.

1463
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,590
That's all [inaudible].

1464
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,040
They're known for their whole life.

1465
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:50,874
Like,

1466
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,031
oh,

1467
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:51,570
he's the fighter.

1468
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,060
When did you next night when your next
fight and then if you don't fight for a

1469
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,061
couple months,

1470
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,370
you've got people like I broke my jaw,

1471
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,990
my last fight constantly people asking,

1472
00:36:57,991 --> 00:36:58,680
so when you fight,

1473
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:58,921
hey,

1474
00:36:58,921 --> 00:36:59,550
you done fighting me.

1475
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,031
He doesn't find,

1476
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:00,390
it's like,

1477
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,150
fuck.

1478
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,760
How long ago was that in August.

1479
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:06,570
The fucking first punch of
the fight broke it clean,

1480
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,570
still went into the second round.

1481
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,630
I was trying to finish him,

1482
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,300
trying to put them away because I knew
if I win one more I'll get back in the

1483
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:13,134
UFC.

1484
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,220
So that was a tough one.

1485
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,200
But uh,

1486
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,390
it,

1487
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,530
it forced me to meditate.

1488
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:17,040
It forced me.

1489
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,090
I would have my jaw wired fucking tight
shut for eight weeks and I couldn't talk

1490
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:23,160
because my TMJ joint would flare up.

1491
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:25,450
So I'd have like bad headaches.

1492
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,540
So I'd had to sit in
my chair and I'm like,

1493
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:27,811
okay,

1494
00:37:27,811 --> 00:37:28,860
I have to do this.

1495
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,000
So I just read,

1496
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,740
started meditating and I'm like,

1497
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,603
dude,

1498
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,620
you just suck liquid through
your teeth every day,

1499
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,370
all day.

1500
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,360
I remember when I hurt my foot,

1501
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:40,194
I was like,

1502
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,920
we were in the ambulance going to the
breath to us by going into the hospital.

1503
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,960
And I remember thinking
this could be worse.

1504
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:48,090
I could have my mouth
and hanging off of me.

1505
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,710
And the thing is it happens man.

1506
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,800
Er Guy,

1507
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,010
there was no one in the year and they're
like you need to let the inflammation

1508
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:53,311
go down.

1509
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:56,400
So I had to go two days and drive
to another city with it hanging off.

1510
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,683
But like I said,

1511
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,980
I wouldn't trade it.

1512
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,340
I wouldn't take it away cause I started
meditating and now sugar is meditating

1513
00:38:02,341 --> 00:38:02,881
and man,

1514
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,950
we've gotten so much
fucking benefits from that.

1515
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,940
It's crazy.

1516
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,170
Even now we're built on it.

1517
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,530
Yeah,

1518
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:07,920
I do.

1519
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,753
On the tank.

1520
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,200
Oh yeah.

1521
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,910
Meditating in the tanks in your house.

1522
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,793
I have one right here.

1523
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:13,610
Yeah.

1524
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,251
So sweet.

1525
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:17,670
That is so such a fucking benefit for me.

1526
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:20,040
It's like when the world
gets weird and world,

1527
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,660
my world is weird as fuck man.

1528
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,231
You know,

1529
00:38:22,231 --> 00:38:23,340
I tried to explain it to people.

1530
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,630
I'm like weird being me.

1531
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,110
I bet.

1532
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:25,381
You know.

1533
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:27,770
And to be able to just
take some time and just,

1534
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:30,840
it's just look at it
all through fresh eyes.

1535
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:33,660
Like that's the place for
me at the end of that tank.

1536
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,950
I like an hour,

1537
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,910
but I do too.

1538
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:37,750
If I have the time,

1539
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,160
I like two hour session.

1540
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:39,800
It would be,

1541
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,580
yeah.

1542
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:40,890
Got,

1543
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,580
then you have it here
is what it's all about.

1544
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,960
So I can just do it anytime I want.

1545
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:44,440
Hell yeah.

1546
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,810
Like I wake up at three
o'clock in the morning.

1547
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:46,720
You just drive over here.

1548
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,583
Sweet.

1549
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,120
What's your morning routine like?

1550
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,450
Or do you have a morning routine that
you like or do you just kind of cardio?

1551
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,100
That's what I like to do.

1552
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,390
Or fasted yoga.

1553
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:55,801
That's my,

1554
00:38:55,801 --> 00:39:00,640
my most recent thing as I'm doing either
14 to 16 hours depending upon what my

1555
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:01,474
day looks like.

1556
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,190
Intermittent fasting.

1557
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,121
And then,

1558
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:04,510
uh,

1559
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,860
I usually either like yoga or running in
the morning today was running and then

1560
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:10,420
I'll do something in the afternoon.

1561
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:13,720
Either martial arts related
or weightlifting related.

1562
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:14,591
Do you,

1563
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:14,860
uh,

1564
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,900
do you drink coffee every morning?

1565
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:16,241
Like when you,

1566
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,110
right when you wake up or,

1567
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:17,980
not always,

1568
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,790
but I like it.

1569
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,581
I like these things.

1570
00:39:19,581 --> 00:39:21,190
She's Nitros who's caveman?

1571
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,230
Nitros a lot like regular coffee too,

1572
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:25,510
but I drink water with
Himalayan salt in it too.

1573
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:26,620
That's one of the first things.

1574
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,431
Yeah.

1575
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,370
I could put a little lemon in
there to the certain times.

1576
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,480
Sometimes I'll throw a little cayenne
pepper and that mother fucker.

1577
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:32,890
Wow.

1578
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,900
Any apple cider ever
vinegar to that stuff?

1579
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:35,800
Sometimes too.

1580
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:37,510
I take a lot of probiotics,

1581
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,801
a lot of,

1582
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,120
I eat a lot of Kimchi.

1583
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,080
I find like Kimchi and gave me is like
I've been on this kick for the past three

1584
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:48,010
or four months where I just
eat Kimchi and elk like three,

1585
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,820
four times a week.

1586
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,140
I mean on stuff do it.

1587
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:54,010
It's hard when you eat milk before bed
and you wake up hard as rob won the fuck

1588
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:54,844
people up.

1589
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,190
People don't know

1590
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,830
the super athlete.

1591
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,670
If you eat elk,

1592
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:00,870
you're,

1593
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,710
you're literally eat a super athlete.

1594
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,800
You know it's bad ass like another reason,

1595
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:06,970
not just a doctor Andy,

1596
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:08,000
but listening to you.

1597
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:10,060
You talk about it because it's
in your podcast all the time.

1598
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:12,880
Talk about how how beneficial
eaten those kinds of meats are.

1599
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,223
And I'm just like,

1600
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,561
God,

1601
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:15,281
I got to do it.

1602
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,114
And I would just,

1603
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,510
I feel,

1604
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,040
I feel so much better doing it.

1605
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,491
Well,

1606
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:21,910
if you think about like how
healthy it is to eat salmon,

1607
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:24,340
like a healthy wild salmon,

1608
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,270
that is a,

1609
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,610
an animal that's out there hustling,

1610
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,301
you know,

1611
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,420
Sam and making its way up river,

1612
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,360
you eat one of those things.

1613
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:34,630
It's just loaded with
nutrients and essential fats.

1614
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,700
When you eat an elk man,

1615
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:41,140
you're eating an animal that's getting
away from wolves and bears and fighting

1616
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:43,540
to the death with swords
grown out of its head.

1617
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,261
I mean,

1618
00:40:44,261 --> 00:40:49,261
literally it's a forest horse with
fucking spears grown out of its head and

1619
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:52,090
they're just out there
hustling serious day.

1620
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,540
You know,

1621
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,520
living out in Montana in the winter,

1622
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,870
in the middle of the fucking winter,

1623
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,880
running from wolves and shit.

1624
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,091
I mean,

1625
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:58,924
that's their life.

1626
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,490
You eat one of those things you eat.

1627
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:00,910
It's like,

1628
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,550
Oh fuck you get charged up.

1629
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,010
It feels,

1630
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,930
I've given it to people who've never
eaten it before and they're like,

1631
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:08,830
Holy Shit.

1632
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,280
And My,

1633
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,640
yeah,

1634
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,600
you feel different,

1635
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,200
right?

1636
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,080
You feel like even their DNA.

1637
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,910
Do you ever do listen to Paul Chek?

1638
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,201
Paul Chek,

1639
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:18,670
he's the [inaudible] Guy,

1640
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,420
right?

1641
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,021
Isn't ain't no.

1642
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,250
He's been on Aubrey's and stuff.

1643
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,150
He's a no,

1644
00:41:22,151 --> 00:41:24,610
I'm thinking of Paul Vernac
thinking of different guy.

1645
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,121
Yeah,

1646
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,410
I've have listened to Paul Chek.

1647
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,830
I listened to him on Arbery's punch.

1648
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,620
That's amazing.

1649
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,080
Yeah.

1650
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,351
Fuck.

1651
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:30,040
He's a wizard.

1652
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,130
He was explaining how
a pasture raised eggs,

1653
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,890
just regular eggs that were literally
eating the DNA of that chicken and it was

1654
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,170
he,

1655
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,340
I don't remember what exactly he said,

1656
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:41,360
but it blew my mind.

1657
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:42,194
I was like,

1658
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,101
he's awesome.

1659
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:43,430
He would.

1660
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:43,880
That'd be,

1661
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,301
that'd be good.

1662
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,111
Podcasting on him.

1663
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:45,890
That would be sweet.

1664
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,840
I'd have him on for
sure would be so sweet.

1665
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,093
Chickens.

1666
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,250
They love to eat bugs and worms and
grass and they will love to roam around.

1667
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:56,000
And if they are allowed to do that,

1668
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,800
they get a dark like an orange yolk that
you just don't get from those God damn

1669
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:01,481
grocery store,

1670
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:01,720
eggs,

1671
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,121
chickens,

1672
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:06,440
those grocery store chickens are prisoners
getting little prisoner eggs eaten

1673
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,060
that putting it into your body,

1674
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,680
it's better than nothing.

1675
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,680
But it's nothing like a farm
raised free range chicken,

1676
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:14,931
egg.

1677
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,400
And you could get those at farmer's
markets and stuff like that like,

1678
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,610
but you could tell the
moment you crack them open.

1679
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,470
I mean it's just orange,

1680
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,400
like the sun,

1681
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,150
you know,

1682
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,140
take care of your chickens.

1683
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,411
Yeah,

1684
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:25,244
y'all have,

1685
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,660
what's that?

1686
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,493
Are they a pain?

1687
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,170
It's not the easiest thing really.

1688
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:30,531
You know?

1689
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:30,891
Yeah.

1690
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:33,990
You got to clean the shit and you got
to make sure they have enough food.

1691
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:34,431
And for me,

1692
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:35,720
I got a squirrel problem.

1693
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,360
My wife wants to kill
the fuck at squirrels.

1694
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,631
Me.

1695
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:40,560
I'm like they're cute little fellas,

1696
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,791
right?

1697
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,200
But they steal all the food.

1698
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,440
They're fat fucking squirrels cause they
keep figuring out a way to get into the

1699
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:48,560
chicken coop and get all the chicken
food and they're just in there all the

1700
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:48,741
time.

1701
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:52,010
But now I might have to put them to
death because I found out they'd been

1702
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:52,880
stealing eggs.

1703
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,760
The squirrels have now figured
out that they can get eggs.

1704
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,470
And so a squirrel was trying to roll an
egg out of the chicken coop through the

1705
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:01,730
hole that he comes in.

1706
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,690
We caught him doing that.

1707
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,583
I didn't catch him.

1708
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,000
Catch him.

1709
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,440
How are you going to get a little fucker?

1710
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,340
I Dunno.

1711
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,293
I Dunno.

1712
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,950
I bet it feels good.

1713
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,630
I've never,

1714
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,410
I never hunted and uh,

1715
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,770
but it feels good shooting and
then eating the meat you get.

1716
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,540
It does.

1717
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,450
I'm nervous though because I feel like
I'd feel so guilty shooting an animal.

1718
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,170
You will.

1719
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,760
I remember I shot up
there a little bit longer.

1720
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:23,081
Look at him.

1721
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:23,914
He's got an egg.

1722
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,100
That's yours.

1723
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,350
No,

1724
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:25,770
it's not.

1725
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,290
I'll pull that back.

1726
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:27,890
Jamie.

1727
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,101
This,

1728
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:29,960
I had no idea that squirrel's did this.

1729
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,790
I had to find out on my own yard.

1730
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,800
These little faces.

1731
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,971
Their egg Steelers,

1732
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:35,480
Bro.

1733
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:35,960
They,

1734
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,010
how do they know?

1735
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:37,850
How do they know?

1736
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:38,690
They're so cute.

1737
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,770
They're so cute.

1738
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,760
How do they know?

1739
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:45,510
They fucking know at times
a little motherfucker.

1740
00:43:45,511 --> 00:43:46,370
You got the chickens.

1741
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,100
Chickens don't know what
to do but it's bloody.

1742
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,210
Yeah.

1743
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,760
Squirrels or they're not
smart but they're determined.

1744
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,490
I think I might have to run a
fucking Arrow through a few of them.

1745
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah,

1746
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,460
but I don't want to kill the squirrels.

1747
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,230
That's the city.

1748
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,190
Like I don't want them eating my eggs,

1749
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:04,910
but I also don't want to kill
them so I don't know what to do.

1750
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,770
I know it's like they have one last way
to block off their holes but they keep

1751
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:11,000
opening new holes.

1752
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:11,671
Fuck.

1753
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,500
Cause what this guy did?

1754
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,940
He made a protector boxers.

1755
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:14,803
Oh,

1756
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,690
I'm not sure we're doing just like my
brother and my brother says though,

1757
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:17,931
man,

1758
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:18,410
if you,

1759
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,490
if you're hunting and you're,

1760
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:20,960
you're a really good shot,

1761
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:23,330
you're going to put that thing away
and it didn't even know it died.

1762
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,590
It lived a great life.

1763
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:25,730
I home,

1764
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:27,660
it's done and you to meet like,

1765
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,281
listen man,

1766
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:29,870
that's the best case scenario.

1767
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,070
Yeah.

1768
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:31,801
Here's the thing though,

1769
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,500
they don't live forever anyway,

1770
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,740
and the way they die in the wild by
getting torn apart by wolves or coyotes or

1771
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,700
mountain lions is way worse
than a bullet or an arrow.

1772
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,421
You know?

1773
00:44:42,421 --> 00:44:43,170
I mean,

1774
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,740
the life of an elk is a
quick life if you're like,

1775
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,690
not that one,

1776
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,980
but the one that one's probably
only like maybe five years old,

1777
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,300
but the one outside,

1778
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,370
the big one over by the mats,

1779
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,140
that one's about nine years old.

1780
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,310
That's about as old as you gut.

1781
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,820
If you find like a 10 11 year old elk,

1782
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:03,780
Holy Shit,

1783
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:07,320
that guy's live forever and their teeth
are all worn down and I didn't know.

1784
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:07,801
I didn't know that.

1785
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:08,490
I had no idea.

1786
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:08,911
Yeah,

1787
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:10,170
they don't live very long.

1788
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,500
You know,

1789
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,180
it's a hustle and they're,

1790
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:15,870
they're out there just fighting for
their life and trying to get by.

1791
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,580
Most of the time they're just grazing,

1792
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,580
but they'll look up and they'll see
a wolf or something and it's like,

1793
00:45:20,581 --> 00:45:21,151
fuck,

1794
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:21,661
it's on,

1795
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:22,290
man.

1796
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,040
I have some friends that live in
Idaho and you know w I know who has a

1797
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:31,041
considerable both population and they
went on this scouting trip and when they

1798
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:33,780
were up in the hills they kept finding,

1799
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,080
they found four dead really large bull
elk that were torn apart by wolves.

1800
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,410
And over the course of
like a 10 mile hike,

1801
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,950
they found four of them laying
there dead torn apart by wolves.

1802
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:47,641
And they're like,

1803
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,900
Holy Shit.

1804
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,190
Like this is crazy.

1805
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,170
So the wolves will eat part of it,

1806
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,300
leave it there and it's
cold as shit where they are.

1807
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:55,860
They don't have to worry
about the meat going bad.

1808
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,970
So they'll kill it,

1809
00:45:56,971 --> 00:45:57,781
tear it apart,

1810
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:59,540
and then they'll find
another one and they'll,

1811
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,770
their instinct is to
go after the next one.

1812
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,190
They don't,

1813
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,190
they don't like just kill one
and say we've got enough food,

1814
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,930
we'll eat this until we were full.

1815
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:07,831
And then when we get hungry,

1816
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,600
go hunt another one.

1817
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,030
Yeah,

1818
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:09,863
there's hunters.

1819
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:11,570
They do what's called the,

1820
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,040
what do they call it?

1821
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,780
It's not like they don't
call it sport hunting.

1822
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:20,070
There's a word for it when they
kill like they was in Wyoming.

1823
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,340
What was that one crazy story in Wyoming,

1824
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:26,100
they killed 19 elk and
didn't even eat them.

1825
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:27,400
Yeah.

1826
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,380
They don't read for fun.

1827
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:28,681
No,

1828
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:29,730
they don't do it for fun.

1829
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,140
They can't help themselves.

1830
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,730
It's like surplus,

1831
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,670
surplus killing.

1832
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,560
They just,

1833
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,940
they know they can get away with it,

1834
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:37,830
so they just do it and then they'll,

1835
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,210
they'll cash them.

1836
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:39,660
Yeah.

1837
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,380
Look at this.

1838
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,570
19 out they,

1839
00:46:41,571 --> 00:46:42,000
they,

1840
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,070
they recovered all of
them and stacked them.

1841
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,630
They're not little either,

1842
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:46,464
bro.

1843
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,800
These are the ones they brought
down from Canada to the wolves.

1844
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,920
They brought them down to the 90s to
repopulate Yellowstone because we had

1845
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:55,950
eradicated wolves from
most of the western states.

1846
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,040
Do you see that animal they just found
in Montana and they don't even know what

1847
00:46:59,041 --> 00:46:59,520
it is?

1848
00:46:59,520 --> 00:46:59,701
Yeah,

1849
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:00,720
it's a wolf hybrid.

1850
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,420
I saw a wolf vibrated with what?

1851
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,273
The dog?

1852
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:03,841
Yeah.

1853
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:05,940
Wolf probably fucked a
German shepherd or something.

1854
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,073
They do.

1855
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:08,310
Most of the time they kill them.

1856
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,631
They'll kill dogs.

1857
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,360
They eat dogs constantly
that he funded that one.

1858
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:12,760
Yeah.

1859
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,070
He's probably hungry or probably
horny rather not hungry and just said,

1860
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,210
fuck off.

1861
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,230
Fuck this dog.

1862
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:20,640
And see what happens.

1863
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,830
Yeah.

1864
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:22,110
Yeah.

1865
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:22,711
Or a dog.

1866
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:24,450
Fuck him or fucked her rather.

1867
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,090
It could've been that seriously.

1868
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:26,790
I don't know.

1869
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,720
But you saw it.

1870
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,021
Did she?

1871
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:28,980
That pictures of that thing.

1872
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,010
To me it looks like

1873
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,210
a wolf dog hybrid.

1874
00:47:31,211 --> 00:47:32,200
Like maybe if somebody had,

1875
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,640
what does that does this crazy Russian
dog that looks like a werewolf.

1876
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:41,890
It's this weird Russian dog that's like
fucking crazy hair all over the place.

1877
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,260
And if a wolf fuck one of those,

1878
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,610
it would probably look like this thing.

1879
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,413
Yeah.

1880
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,640
Did you find that thing?

1881
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,670
What does it look like?

1882
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,840
They're good pictures of
it so that picture sucks.

1883
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,250
That's just the back of it.

1884
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,410
And this is another picture of it.

1885
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,290
It's head

1886
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,750
wolf dog shooting in Montana
draws international intention.

1887
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,130
Is it t?

1888
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,770
To me it just looks like
a dog fucked a wolf.

1889
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,030
It's just a big ass.

1890
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,960
Hold the dog.

1891
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:08,640
Fuck her though.

1892
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,700
That is a big fucker.

1893
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:10,843
He,

1894
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,510
it's a big animal that
looks like 150 pound dog.

1895
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:14,390
Jeez.

1896
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,660
It'd be a little pickup too.

1897
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,370
It could be like at Tacoma,

1898
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,993
right?

1899
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,010
It's hard to tell and let's crazy.

1900
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,181
They look,

1901
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:23,014
they're beautiful man.

1902
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,220
I'm glad they're out there.

1903
00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:25,181
They're fascinating,

1904
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:26,830
but they're rough on wildlife,

1905
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:27,270
but that's,

1906
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:28,103
that's their life.

1907
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,360
Their life is out there killing and
the elks life is out there surviving.

1908
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:36,760
And the way I feel about hunting is you
just dip your legs and your body into

1909
00:48:36,761 --> 00:48:39,640
that world with discipline and with,

1910
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:39,840
uh,

1911
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,150
uh,

1912
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,530
an understanding of what you're doing.

1913
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,540
And if you get lucky and
you get an opportunity,

1914
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,250
you kill one of those
animals and bring it out.

1915
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,151
And they'd like,

1916
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:46,481
to me,

1917
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:47,770
that is the cleanest,

1918
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,240
best way to eat meat.

1919
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,080
Yeah.

1920
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,080
I just feel like there's no better way
in terms of like a Karma in terms of your

1921
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,710
interaction with nature,

1922
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,620
the understanding connection
that you have to your food.

1923
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:00,190
There's just so,

1924
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,510
and then health wise,

1925
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,430
there's no Monsanto,

1926
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:04,540
GMO,

1927
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,040
no spraying.

1928
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:06,671
I mean you're,

1929
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:11,671
you're eating a pure
animal issue on Sunday.

1930
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:12,821
Well,

1931
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,930
Montana is the place,

1932
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:14,500
man.

1933
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,180
Go back home means shit.

1934
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:20,650
It's one of the Montana is some of the
best elk hunting in the entire country.

1935
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,450
I'd rather just eat my dad and brothers.

1936
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:23,470
I'm more of a gathering.

1937
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,500
That's good too,

1938
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,333
man.

1939
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:26,951
Hey man,

1940
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:27,461
nothing wrong.

1941
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:28,870
We've gathered a farming man.

1942
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:30,490
Grow your own fucking vegetables.

1943
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:31,900
You know that's the wrong cap.

1944
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,651
That's the plan.

1945
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:35,320
Eventually we're going to make a
compound and have our own animals.

1946
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:35,471
Hey,

1947
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:36,660
I'll give you guys some meat.

1948
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:38,980
I got a whole couple
of freezers back there.

1949
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,380
That would be so when you guys go back,

1950
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,760
we're going to drive back then after.

1951
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,810
Oh Shit.

1952
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,131
Oh Hook.

1953
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:44,560
Yup.

1954
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:44,950
Thank you.

1955
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:45,761
By the time you get home,

1956
00:49:45,761 --> 00:49:46,594
you'll have,

1957
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:47,740
you won't even be frozen,

1958
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,090
but it won't even be thought out yet.

1959
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,210
How old were you when you
took your first rip of weed?

1960
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:52,541
Weed?

1961
00:49:52,541 --> 00:49:53,140
I was third.

1962
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,040
Well not really.

1963
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,750
So I'd smoked when I was younger,

1964
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,040
but it was only like occasionally at
like a party and always felt like a loser

1965
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:00,874
for doing it.

1966
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:01,180
You know,

1967
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,730
like everybody else would
be getting high and,

1968
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:03,940
but who toilet and,

1969
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:06,160
but I was probably already drunk anyway,

1970
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:06,730
you know,

1971
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,650
like when I was 14 or 15
or something like that.

1972
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,090
So maybe I smoked weed a handful of times,

1973
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,880
less than a dozen times until I was 30.

1974
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,970
And then Eddie Bravo got me
into it when I was 30 years old.

1975
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,090
We were doing Jujitsu together and uh,

1976
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:26,100
he was telling me how marijuana is helping
his Jujitsu and helping his music and

1977
00:50:26,171 --> 00:50:26,861
his creativity.

1978
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:27,140
It was,

1979
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,130
what the fuck is this

1980
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,963
guy talking about,

1981
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:29,410
Mike?

1982
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:29,631
Dude,

1983
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:31,010
marijuana just makes it stupid.

1984
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:31,551
Like don't,

1985
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,360
you know,

1986
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:32,751
you know,

1987
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:33,111
and he's like,

1988
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:33,944
just try it.

1989
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,150
And he,

1990
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:37,080
we got high and uh,

1991
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,750
I remember thinking like,

1992
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,643
Oh,

1993
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,940
this is what it is.

1994
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:41,721
Like,

1995
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:42,860
wow,

1996
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,700
I did not know Sam.

1997
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,110
Sam believe that feeling like you're like,

1998
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,630
why it's this?

1999
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:50,811
No,

2000
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:51,644
it's just me and Eddie.

2001
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:51,921
Oh,

2002
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:52,580
sweet.

2003
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:52,700
Oh,

2004
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:52,880
sorry.

2005
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,930
I can't believe this.

2006
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:55,280
We went and got something to eat.

2007
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:56,210
We're talking.

2008
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,541
Oh yeah,

2009
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,530
we giggled like crazy.

2010
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,780
Talked about all kinds of crazy shit.

2011
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,610
And then I remember I started smoking
pot and getting on stage and got real.

2012
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,181
It was her kitten.

2013
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:06,470
Real creative with my,

2014
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:08,410
my comedy and then smoking pot,

2015
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,270
doing Jujitsu.

2016
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,860
I was like,

2017
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,320
I can't believe how was zoned
in and gets you with training,

2018
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,970
smoking pot and hitting the bag to this
day is like one of my all time favorite

2019
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:17,720
things.

2020
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,980
I get paranoid.

2021
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:19,950
I get freaked out.

2022
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:20,784
I get weirded out,

2023
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,620
I get,

2024
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,550
I get freaked out,

2025
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,810
but then I just fucking crap up my hands
put on the timer and just once that

2026
00:51:26,811 --> 00:51:28,780
sweat starts flowing and she's stuck

2027
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:34,400
and it's almost like the paranoia
and the weirdness of it all.

2028
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,890
You just fight it off by hitting that bag.

2029
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,173
Boom,

2030
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:38,870
boom.

2031
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:39,111
You know,

2032
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:42,980
and you hear the bell that says 30 seconds
and you're Florian and then you get

2033
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:47,981
that one minute off to think about life
and the future and the fucking universe

2034
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:51,750
and volcanoes and Guatemala
and Hawaii and Oh God,

2035
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,280
the bell goes off again.

2036
00:51:53,281 --> 00:51:54,114
You've got another three rent,

2037
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:55,790
few minutes and man,

2038
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:56,680
it's one of my,

2039
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,513
my Blake,

2040
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,070
it's,

2041
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,600
it's a psychedelic experience.

2042
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,900
It's like a cleansing experience
hitting the bag when you're high.

2043
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,580
I like sh I love shadowboxing.

2044
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,810
When I'm high I'll take a rebel
at home and just sit there,

2045
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,140
have a little mirror and I'll just
shadowbox don't even know how long.

2046
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,340
I just can just shout a box for it.

2047
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,140
Go.

2048
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:12,921
Do you know what's weird?

2049
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,800
Like you feel balanced when you're high.

2050
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,880
You feel like,

2051
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,190
like maybe like if you got an injury,

2052
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,540
you feel it more,

2053
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,700
you feel like we're laser off.

2054
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:23,661
You know what I mean?

2055
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,920
And like for me,

2056
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,020
I,

2057
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:29,690
I feel my transfer a power
better when I'm high.

2058
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,620
Like,

2059
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,210
like certain techniques I,

2060
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:36,170
I really get the timing of
like when to turn the hip over.

2061
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:38,270
I feel it more when I'm high.

2062
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:38,680
I like,

2063
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,750
I feel the connection
with all that tissue,

2064
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,370
all of it working together.

2065
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,220
I swear it helps you just stay
in the moment a little bit more.

2066
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:49,160
Especially at night after you train
real hard and you're thinking about your

2067
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:50,170
mind's going a hundred miles per hour.

2068
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,020
Take one rep and you're,

2069
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:52,490
yeah,

2070
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,323
I like gravy.

2071
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:54,490
Like hello.

2072
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:59,420
Like everyone always ask if how much
I smoke when I smoke after surgery,

2073
00:52:59,510 --> 00:52:59,631
uh,

2074
00:52:59,631 --> 00:53:00,351
smoking all day.

2075
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:00,951
The doctor said,

2076
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:01,131
hey,

2077
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:01,964
did they do to your foot?

2078
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,410
So I tore the Liz Frank.

2079
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,020
So I,

2080
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,960
I think that fractionate
and tore the ligaments.

2081
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,040
What is the Liz Frank,

2082
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,083
um,

2083
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:08,541
what is it?

2084
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:11,930
Why is it called Liz franc was one poor
girl have a fucking horrible injury.

2085
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:13,520
These ligaments right here.

2086
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:14,473
I don't know frank.

2087
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,600
And that was in that,

2088
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,740
that was the Sukin tough fight.

2089
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,613
Yeah.

2090
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,380
Um,

2091
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:19,700
I did,

2092
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,850
I threw a kick and I landed and
I launched off my right foot,

2093
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,070
throw a right hand and I felt
that snapped right there.

2094
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,330
Cause

2095
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,541
we,

2096
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,570
we watched the replay.

2097
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,433
Oh there it is right here.

2098
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,400
So it lists frank joint complex.

2099
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,323
Oh,

2100
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,650
so that's where it tour.

2101
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,110
I'm just glad there's someone
smart enough on this war,

2102
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,180
on this earth to be able to fix my foot.

2103
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,290
Do I think of my mouth?

2104
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,000
I was like Bob Smart people in this world.

2105
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:42,900
And so your,

2106
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:44,400
what do you like 11 weeks out?

2107
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,810
[inaudible] 11 weeks out,

2108
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:47,270
10 11 weeks out and I'm,

2109
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,870
I'm feeling about 85,

2110
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:49,704
90%.

2111
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,121
I go to the doctor and,

2112
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:51,250
um,

2113
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,550
a couple of weeks to kick
in the bag with that foot.

2114
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,091
I was feeling good.

2115
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:54,251
Yeah.

2116
00:53:54,251 --> 00:53:57,300
It's feeling like that was the first
time I kicked the bag and that felt good.

2117
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,650
I was excited about that.

2118
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,670
But it's awesome.

2119
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,241
It's a,

2120
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:01,920
it's great that they could fix shit man.

2121
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,061
Seriously.

2122
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,440
Thank God for smart people.

2123
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,340
I know.

2124
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:05,731
I was like,

2125
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:07,290
I wouldn't be fucked right now,

2126
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,341
but I guess this,

2127
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:08,641
this,

2128
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:09,250
this injury,

2129
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,970
like a ton of people get it
and they just don't know.

2130
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:12,750
They just,

2131
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,990
they just let it kind of
heal and live with it.

2132
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:16,740
But,

2133
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,420
and what was it like,

2134
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,440
like as it was healing?

2135
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:20,820
Like what does it impede?

2136
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,003
What's impede?

2137
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,750
What does it stop you from doing?

2138
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:26,430
What does it slow you down with?

2139
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:27,264
What is,

2140
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,800
what does it get in the way of things?

2141
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,023
Walking,

2142
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,800
just walking hurts so bad.

2143
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,250
Um,

2144
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,450
I,

2145
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,420
I didn't do anything.

2146
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:34,410
I remember the doctor said,

2147
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,400
just stay off your foot.

2148
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,890
I literally played fortnight.

2149
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:37,591
I was playing,

2150
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:41,250
like I was living a professional
gamer life for a month.

2151
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,930
I was gaming eight hours a day.

2152
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:46,020
I would wake up and I'd go and
game for eight hours a day,

2153
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:46,471
three high.

2154
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:48,360
The whole time I was smoking like,

2155
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,340
cause I personally don't
like smoking all day.

2156
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,560
I feel like it makes me unload and not,

2157
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,161
it's not the weed,

2158
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:53,491
it's me.

2159
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:54,480
I feel I'm motivated,

2160
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,160
I just don't really like it.

2161
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,711
But when I was playing,

2162
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:56,400
when I was gaming,

2163
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,031
it was the best.

2164
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:58,500
I just game and smoking all day.

2165
00:54:58,830 --> 00:54:59,663
But uh,

2166
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,301
yeah,

2167
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,134
I was,

2168
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,880
I was I going with that,

2169
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:03,930
the surgery of the fruit.

2170
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:05,910
So let's talk about,

2171
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:06,300
um,

2172
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,290
let's talk about smoking weed.

2173
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:07,740
Um,

2174
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:12,330
I like weed as I can
nightly the celebration,

2175
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:14,310
almost like I want to get
shit done during the day.

2176
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,151
I wake up,

2177
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:16,530
do my morning to go to the gym,

2178
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:17,364
come home,

2179
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,331
do what I do,

2180
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:18,900
eat lunch,

2181
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,311
play for,

2182
00:55:19,311 --> 00:55:20,131
and I go to the gym,

2183
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:20,521
come home.

2184
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:21,211
And that's when I'm like,

2185
00:55:21,211 --> 00:55:21,630
okay,

2186
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,240
I earned because marijuana is so easy.

2187
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,031
And I go there.

2188
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:25,381
I know there's like,

2189
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:27,210
you have a huge following of,

2190
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:27,930
of,

2191
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,400
um,

2192
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,600
the people who smoke
weed and it's so easy to,

2193
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:32,490
for marijuana to take over your life and,

2194
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,410
and be in charge of you.

2195
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:35,423
Um,

2196
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,660
and I felt that when I
was gaming and smoking,

2197
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:38,191
I just want,

2198
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:38,941
I like want to do,

2199
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:39,180
I'm like,

2200
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:39,430
ah,

2201
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,960
I don't know,

2202
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,710
whatever.

2203
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:41,430
Take a rip,

2204
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,821
take her up,

2205
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:42,390
take her up.

2206
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:42,990
Um,

2207
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,550
and it takes over your life.

2208
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,980
And I feel like it's,

2209
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:47,814
it,

2210
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,220
it's such a powerful drug.

2211
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,780
Um,

2212
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,581
and I don't like the word drug.

2213
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,414
It's such a powerful,

2214
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,470
it is a drug though.

2215
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,410
Um,

2216
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:53,770
mass,

2217
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:56,600
a lot of people probably masks
a lot of people's feelings.

2218
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,750
How they truly feel.

2219
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,180
It's so easy to get high all
day instead of deal with them.

2220
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:00,961
Certain emotion.

2221
00:56:00,961 --> 00:56:01,260
Yeah.

2222
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:01,580
Um,

2223
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,450
so I just feel like,

2224
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,880
I feel like people are
abusing it way too much now.

2225
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:06,910
Some people certainly are.

2226
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,551
Some people are,

2227
00:56:07,551 --> 00:56:09,230
and I think that's the case
with everything though,

2228
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:09,381
right?

2229
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:10,430
Is it is.

2230
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:11,750
Um,

2231
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:12,680
so this foot thing,

2232
00:56:12,681 --> 00:56:12,980
what did,

2233
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:13,820
how did they fix it?

2234
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,150
What did it,

2235
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,983
what does the surgery,

2236
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,220
uh,

2237
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,960
some pins in to hold the
ligaments together or there
was two options that I was

2238
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:24,040
going to get a plate in my foot and
then six later they were gonna I

2239
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,870
was gonna get surgery
again to take it out,

2240
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:26,500
lay it out.

2241
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:26,891
And I was like,

2242
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,030
that does not sound,

2243
00:56:28,031 --> 00:56:30,040
keep that played in new shit.

2244
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,241
Well,

2245
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:32,230
I land a lot of my,

2246
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,821
a lot of my kicks,

2247
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:34,001
you know,

2248
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,260
you land with your
Special Ed with your Shin,

2249
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:35,620
by land.

2250
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:35,861
A lot of,

2251
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:36,301
with my foot.

2252
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:37,010
It's like a slap.

2253
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:37,960
She'll look at Thompson.

2254
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,360
Yeah,

2255
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,760
he throws a lot of instep kicks.

2256
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:39,941
I mean,

2257
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,460
that was the karate way
for the longest time.

2258
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,870
I literally remember I knock someone
out in Seattle with my foot and the dude

2259
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,580
was out for like 10 minutes.

2260
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,121
It was,

2261
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:49,720
I remember that.

2262
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,260
Yeah,

2263
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,071
that was gnarly.

2264
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:53,890
It was literally my foot
slapping his jaw and I was like,

2265
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:54,940
Holy Shit.

2266
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:57,910
That's most certainly can knock
people out with your foot.

2267
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,300
I mean,

2268
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,490
that's Phil Davis and Belterra
just knock that guy out.

2269
00:57:00,491 --> 00:57:01,390
That was his foot,

2270
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,320
wasn't it?

2271
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,850
Didn't this wetland cats weird.

2272
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,750
You don't see it coming.

2273
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:05,700
Yeah.

2274
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,910
So the shots you don't see coming.

2275
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:07,091
Yeah,

2276
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:07,660
you're right.

2277
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,000
Especially when they
come over the shoulder,

2278
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:10,961
you know those,

2279
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:13,510
those round kicks or come over
the shoulder from the outside.

2280
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,450
Even Thomson [inaudible] through that.

2281
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,130
That was the last prayer,

2282
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,730
one of my favorite knockouts and he
came over like I literally looked at,

2283
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:21,220
came over question why I was so sweet.

2284
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,480
It's almost a question mark.

2285
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:22,691
Yeah.

2286
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:23,710
Almost like that one.

2287
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,400
But you know the question mark one
comes straight up the middle ground.

2288
00:57:26,630 --> 00:57:30,010
I threw the question mark kick
landed and then that's when I did it.

2289
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:30,700
That's what I remember.

2290
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:30,971
Oh yeah.

2291
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,110
I wanted to bring this up too.

2292
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:33,123
I remember,

2293
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:33,580
um,

2294
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,170
you had,

2295
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:34,520
you were,

2296
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,590
I don't remember what podcasts with,

2297
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:36,424
but you're talking about,

2298
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,290
you were looking at my
Instagram and you saw the,

2299
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,180
I did a kick to a guard pass.

2300
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,811
I was in front of him,

2301
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:44,410
did a three 60 yard pass and I remember
you saying he could do that in a fight

2302
00:57:44,411 --> 00:57:45,610
if he practiced it a lot.

2303
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,290
And I've been practicing that,

2304
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:51,550
so I've been doing that for a couple
of years now and I did it in that Andre

2305
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,150
fight I was,

2306
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:55,870
he was up against the cage and I three
60 past into side control and I wanted to

2307
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:56,980
bring that up and tell you that.

2308
00:57:56,981 --> 00:57:57,814
But it was,

2309
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,920
it works spinning.

2310
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:02,650
The people don't know
what to do when you spin.

2311
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:03,921
I spun it,

2312
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:04,331
he covered,

2313
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:05,080
you'd cover it up.

2314
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,621
I'm past,

2315
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:06,760
I'm already inside control now.

2316
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,380
This is a moment they have to think
and when I'm a striking as well,

2317
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,460
usually when I spend a backup and cover
up like I'm going to go to your body

2318
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:16,990
when your body and I'm
gonna go to your head,

2319
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,790
you can get away with a lot of stuff.

2320
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,920
Other people can't you
so fucking athletic.

2321
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:23,290
I feel like you could be a pro
and a bunch of different sports,

2322
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,030
like his timing and his eyes.

2323
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:25,960
Like what did the doctor say?

2324
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,100
You have some of the best eyes.

2325
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,520
Yeah,

2326
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,800
I remember going to the eye doctor a
few different ones and they're like,

2327
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,311
oh my God,

2328
00:58:30,311 --> 00:58:31,144
your eyes are,

2329
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,610
there are some of the best
I've ever seen in my life.

2330
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:34,480
Like they were taken back.

2331
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:35,314
I Dunno.

2332
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,550
I Dunno if that transfers over
to fighting and my distance,

2333
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:43,540
you know how I see things coming or you
found your range such at a young age to

2334
00:58:43,541 --> 00:58:45,580
not like a wrestler likes
concept penetration.

2335
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:47,470
Penetration penetrates
to start as a striker.

2336
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,910
So he's got his range down so good in
his eyes and his timing and his reaction

2337
00:58:51,911 --> 00:58:53,650
time is so fucking fast.

2338
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,480
So like everyone sees
him and they're like,

2339
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:55,900
oh,

2340
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,160
that's,

2341
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,980
that's beatable.

2342
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,240
But when with him in front of you,

2343
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,160
it's way fucking picture length,

2344
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,690
man for your weight class,

2345
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:03,880
for band and what you're so fucking long.

2346
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,340
And I told you when I saw you,

2347
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:11,140
I thought for a second that you might've
been the son of Michael O'malley.

2348
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,310
There's a guy named Michael O'malley who
was my original taekwondo instructor,

2349
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,830
was a four time national champion.

2350
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:21,860
Like literally one of the best taekwondo
fighters in the world in his play is

2351
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:22,390
tall.

2352
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,610
Yeah,

2353
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:27,410
he's very tall and he fought
one 47 little skinny man.

2354
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:29,600
It's like six three they
cut weight and taekwondo.

2355
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,370
Yes.

2356
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:30,620
Yeah,

2357
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,940
but terribly nobody,

2358
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:33,260
nobody knows what they're doing.

2359
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,540
They cut weight and fight the same day.

2360
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,890
But he was a,

2361
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,731
he was a beast.

2362
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:39,470
He was my original taekwondo instructor.

2363
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,760
He was Jay Hahn,

2364
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:42,410
Kim's prize student.

2365
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:44,160
He was his number one student town.

2366
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,380
And when I started,

2367
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,420
Michael had stopped fighting.

2368
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:50,810
He was just teaching and now
he runs a school in a Peabody.

2369
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,800
But he basically taught me
almost everything that I know.

2370
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,030
And Mr. Kim,

2371
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,630
Mr. Kim took over as
well when he came back.

2372
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:02,240
But when I first started training
there for the first year or so,

2373
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:06,050
Mr. Kim was in Korea and I learned
everything from Mr O'malley.

2374
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,160
Fucking long limbs.

2375
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:07,994
Just that he was younger too,

2376
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:09,030
so fast,

2377
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,580
so fast.

2378
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:11,720
He was so fast.

2379
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,790
He would do demonstrations on people,

2380
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:14,120
you know,

2381
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,510
like demonstrations of the house,

2382
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,380
set things up and you would see
him do things and it was just,

2383
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,760
it was confusing.

2384
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,200
You'd be like fuck.

2385
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:24,560
Imagine if that guy was trying to kick
me like yeah cause you'd be fucked

2386
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,370
because he was so good at setting
things up and footwork and movement.

2387
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:30,020
And so when I saw you I was like,

2388
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:30,741
Holy Shit,

2389
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:33,130
this kid looks like Michael O'malley.

2390
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,740
He's like,

2391
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,070
I thought you were his son.

2392
01:00:35,071 --> 01:00:35,690
That's funny.

2393
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:36,560
Like I really did.

2394
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:37,970
I was like Holy Shit,

2395
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:42,710
his son is fine cause I haven't
talked to Michael in a long time.

2396
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:45,320
I really did think that you were a son.

2397
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,250
That would have been nuts.

2398
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,143
That would have been,

2399
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,541
yeah.

2400
01:00:47,541 --> 01:00:48,141
I was like wow,

2401
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:49,460
when I see this kid I've got to ask him.

2402
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,060
Nope,

2403
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,520
nope,

2404
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:51,890
nope.

2405
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:52,670
Maybe my dad,

2406
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:53,091
who knows.

2407
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,650
Maybe someone was on trial on journey.

2408
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,484
You know what I'm saying?

2409
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,583
I never know.

2410
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,670
This one's crazy.

2411
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:00,321
Massachusetts,

2412
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:00,860
Massachusetts.

2413
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,693
Yeah.

2414
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:02,510
Hmm.

2415
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:03,170
Um,

2416
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,750
so when you first got together,

2417
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:07,940
when you for when you
two first got together,

2418
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:08,870
you were 18?

2419
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:09,660
Yeah.

2420
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,350
When he first,

2421
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,340
when he was commentating the fight.

2422
01:01:11,341 --> 01:01:11,430
Yeah,

2423
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:11,841
I was 18.

2424
01:01:11,841 --> 01:01:12,300
I'm going it down.

2425
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,170
How old are you now?

2426
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:13,960
23,

2427
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,280
23 and so you guys have been hanging out
together and train together the entire

2428
01:01:18,281 --> 01:01:19,000
time?

2429
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,091
Yeah,

2430
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,470
we've been best friends the entire time.

2431
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:24,460
So it's like in sugar really like looks
up to me and trust is my opinion and the

2432
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,430
listens to me and that
makes me have to up my game.

2433
01:01:27,431 --> 01:01:27,611
You know,

2434
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:30,310
I have constantly have to research cause
I know he trusts me and I know he looks

2435
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,400
up to me so I have to make sure
everything's really top notch.

2436
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,691
It's,

2437
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:33,820
it's,

2438
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,920
it's nice now that I'm in a
position to where I can pee.

2439
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:37,420
He's,

2440
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,111
he's my coach.

2441
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,160
Like he's my main coach.

2442
01:01:39,161 --> 01:01:39,430
I can,

2443
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:40,720
I'm paying him to be my coach.

2444
01:01:40,721 --> 01:01:41,830
He's focusing on me,

2445
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:42,993
my diet,

2446
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,013
um,

2447
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,310
watching videos he sent like on Instagram
you'll send me videos of like we're,

2448
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,720
I'm digital is my favorite
sport in the Geek.

2449
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:55,440
That's probably what I've trained the
most in like since since my surgery just

2450
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:58,240
pretty much what I've been
doing is just drilling in the G.

2451
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:58,330
Um,

2452
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:03,330
he teaches at a Jen soul fighters
and I go there and drill Monday,

2453
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:03,340
Wednesday,

2454
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:03,760
Friday.

2455
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,210
Um,

2456
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,210
but he's constantly sending
me videos of nutrition,

2457
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,110
Jujitsu,

2458
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,700
sleeping,

2459
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:10,151
just any,

2460
01:02:10,151 --> 01:02:10,571
anything,

2461
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:11,710
any knowledge he's sending me.

2462
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,190
So it's,

2463
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,720
he's such a huge benefit,

2464
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:17,600
like a huge benefit to me to
becoming what I want to be in.

2465
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:18,340
It's so awesome.

2466
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,580
Like we're doing this
together so it's cool.

2467
01:02:20,581 --> 01:02:22,260
I remember being 19 and their apartment,

2468
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:24,000
like this is what I wanted.

2469
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:28,080
Everything like training and to
have to have him here with me.

2470
01:02:28,310 --> 01:02:29,011
Even just being here,

2471
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,260
it's just so awesome to travel everywhere.

2472
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,070
Everywhere I go he's,

2473
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,851
we're going places,

2474
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:35,280
we're traveling and we're training
everywhere we go or train.

2475
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:36,143
It's awesome.

2476
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,070
So how satisfying is it for you to see
him in a position like the Andre fight

2477
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,750
where like I thought you made a big leap
in between that fight and who is your

2478
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,740
around around.

2479
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:47,400
That's right.

2480
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,630
Which was a very good fight too,

2481
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,770
but I was like,

2482
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:50,311
damn,

2483
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:51,780
this kid's getting better.

2484
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,520
I'll be like,

2485
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,640
you made a leap.

2486
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,380
You are doing a lot of like weird,

2487
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:58,010
unpredictable shit in
the [inaudible] fight.

2488
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,000
You were moving around
a lot and I was like,

2489
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:04,380
you will have real confident and like
you were just constantly moving forward.

2490
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:05,160
How,

2491
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,993
how,

2492
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,440
how much is it?

2493
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,980
Like how good does it feel
to watch someone improve?

2494
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:11,814
Like that

2495
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:12,270
dude,

2496
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,850
it feels just as good as as if it
was me doing it sometimes more,

2497
01:03:15,851 --> 01:03:16,210
right?

2498
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:17,800
Like sometimes like sometimes more.

2499
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:18,281
That's how I'm like,

2500
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:19,114
man,

2501
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:19,451
yeah,

2502
01:03:19,451 --> 01:03:20,440
it feels fucking good.

2503
01:03:20,441 --> 01:03:21,730
But every after every fight I'm like,

2504
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:21,881
dude,

2505
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,020
let's treat it like we lost.

2506
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:24,940
Lost that fight.

2507
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:25,511
Always said that.

2508
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:25,870
He said,

2509
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:26,870
I go out cause I keep,

2510
01:03:26,871 --> 01:03:28,320
I'm tenant and all right now and every,

2511
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:29,320
every fight I've won,

2512
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:29,560
he said,

2513
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,393
let's pretend you lost.

2514
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,460
And I've improved so much in between
fights because I live this lifestyle that

2515
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:35,591
I,

2516
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:36,130
and I don't,

2517
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,720
I don't really party too much when I do.

2518
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:38,554
I like the party though,

2519
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:39,940
but I don't really party too much.

2520
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:40,953
Um,

2521
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,800
my life,

2522
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,330
my life is MMA.

2523
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:48,360
It's like my morning is training my
afternoons training and he's constantly

2524
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:48,731
saying,

2525
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:49,241
after a fight,

2526
01:03:49,241 --> 01:03:50,020
let's pretend we lost.

2527
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:50,230
Let's,

2528
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,951
let's improve.

2529
01:03:50,951 --> 01:03:52,570
And I've been prn from that.

2530
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,310
Alfred fight to that Andre fight.

2531
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,010
That was less than a year.

2532
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:58,720
I feel like I improved the most.

2533
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,690
I was just constantly learning.

2534
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,640
It's the sports fucking awesome man.

2535
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,070
It was fucking awesome sport.

2536
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:05,980
It's so awesome.

2537
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,410
It's fucking crazy sport too though,

2538
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:08,710
right?

2539
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,580
It's so nice too.

2540
01:04:09,581 --> 01:04:10,300
Cause like,

2541
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:10,841
ah fuck,

2542
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:12,070
we're getting bored of
Jujitsu a little bit.

2543
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:15,010
Let's go wrestle for a while or let's go
box for awhile and we can always bounce

2544
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:15,671
back and forth.

2545
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:16,341
It's pretty cool.

2546
01:04:16,341 --> 01:04:19,400
Riff fuck around with any weird
stuff like wing Chung or you know,

2547
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:20,813
no.

2548
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,460
Or anything.

2549
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,640
Mushrooms the weirdest.

2550
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,271
Yeah.

2551
01:04:25,271 --> 01:04:26,104
Mushrooms,

2552
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,430
mushrooms are gonna change the world.

2553
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,060
Yeah,

2554
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,930
I think so too.

2555
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:29,561
I met,

2556
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:29,860
yeah.

2557
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:32,080
That's where we're kind of like
dealing with like with sugar.

2558
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:36,070
Like cause we're really starting to
figure out like what ego is and like,

2559
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,180
oh so really,

2560
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,590
really shit,

2561
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:38,821
you know?

2562
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:39,160
Accurate.

2563
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:39,640
Totally.

2564
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,473
Sure.

2565
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,643
I've been learning,

2566
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:46,450
I've been listening to a lot of podcasts
about ego and Aubrey Marcus and with

2567
01:04:46,451 --> 01:04:50,110
Aubrey Marcus and just a
bunch of different people
and it's scary learning about

2568
01:04:50,111 --> 01:04:52,750
your ego and like who you
really are and who you ego is.

2569
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,760
And we're understanding the two different
people like fighting in this whole

2570
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:58,090
life,

2571
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:01,450
this whole like any like
Instagram's basically your ego.

2572
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:02,470
That's who your ego is.

2573
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:03,670
I feel like for me,

2574
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:05,073
um,

2575
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:05,860
Instagram.

2576
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:06,250
Yeah.

2577
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:09,040
I feel like social media
for your character,

2578
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:12,550
like you push out what you want people
to think of you like that kind of thing.

2579
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,420
Everyone does.

2580
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:16,090
Like you post what you want people like
that's what people are gonna think of

2581
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:17,170
you as whatever you post.

2582
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:17,630
Right?

2583
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:17,950
It's like,

2584
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:22,420
and then like realizing because
like I was broke last year,

2585
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,120
this time I was probably broke and now
I have a good amount of money and it's,

2586
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,430
I'm realizing money
doesn't make you happy.

2587
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:29,500
Materialistic things don't make you happy.

2588
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:30,850
And I know everyone says that.

2589
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:31,780
Um,

2590
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:32,231
who was it?

2591
01:05:32,231 --> 01:05:33,490
What's Jim Carey's quote like,

2592
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:34,960
I wish everyone could be rich,

2593
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:38,260
wants to realize that they don't want
to rich and famous and famous to realize

2594
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:40,210
it doesn't make you happy because
I have that a lot of people,

2595
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:41,044
like my little brother,

2596
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,850
I was telling him trying to like get him,

2597
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,030
I want to pay him to help
run my youtube panel.

2598
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,251
I'm like,

2599
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:46,450
you can make $60,000 a year,

2600
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:46,571
blah,

2601
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:46,721
blah,

2602
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:47,230
blah.

2603
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:47,500
He's like,

2604
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:47,621
oh,

2605
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:49,000
that's not a lot and that's not enough.

2606
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:49,810
I'm like,

2607
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,081
dude,

2608
01:05:50,081 --> 01:05:53,650
you could literally not
have to work and be like,

2609
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,120
help me with my youtube do,

2610
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:57,040
but I'm trying to get
millionaires and it's just like,

2611
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,180
that's not what makes you happy.

2612
01:05:58,181 --> 01:05:58,541
And I'm really,

2613
01:05:58,541 --> 01:05:59,710
I'm finding that out.

2614
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:04,720
Like at a young Adam's like I understand
like my ego is motivated by money.

2615
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,370
I love money and I love just this whole
fight game is just all about just,

2616
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:13,300
I feel like I'm learning so much.

2617
01:06:13,301 --> 01:06:13,811
It's hard to,

2618
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:17,230
hard to explain my brain and I'm still
trying to figure out all of this.

2619
01:06:17,231 --> 01:06:18,160
Everything I'm learning,

2620
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,040
I'm listening to so
many podcasts everyday,

2621
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:22,550
reading so many books every day and I,

2622
01:06:22,551 --> 01:06:26,470
I can't really explain what my brain
try try to explain what you were,

2623
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:27,400
your original thoughts.

2624
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:32,020
So like you feel like what you're putting
out on social media is the ego and

2625
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,120
what you really are
like who you really are,

2626
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:35,170
is something different.

2627
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:35,501
Well,

2628
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:35,651
yeah,

2629
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:37,210
I think just humans in general,

2630
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,320
we're all at the core.

2631
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:40,090
We're all just want love and compassion.

2632
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,193
Um,

2633
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,740
and so you want that from fighting fight.

2634
01:06:44,741 --> 01:06:48,850
Like what makes me truly happy is training
digit to you're training in general,

2635
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:51,580
eating healthy and being around people.

2636
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,930
I love being around my dogs.

2637
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,790
I'm watering my flowers.

2638
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,100
Like that's what makes me happy.

2639
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:56,943
That's what makes,

2640
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,053
um,

2641
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:02,020
what kind of satisfaction do
you get from fighting to show?

2642
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:02,800
I love work.

2643
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,090
I love performing.

2644
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:05,290
Ever since I was a little kid,

2645
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,960
I've always tried to perform in
front of whoever was around my,

2646
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:09,140
if we had to get together a fan,

2647
01:07:09,141 --> 01:07:09,331
I get it.

2648
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:10,300
I would always be in a loud,

2649
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:12,040
obnoxious trying to
perform and do something.

2650
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,750
I love performing like that.

2651
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:16,720
Performing in front of huge crowds.

2652
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:17,321
Like he was saying,

2653
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:18,071
the bigger the crowd,

2654
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:19,210
the more people watching them,

2655
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:19,691
the better.

2656
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:20,680
I feel like I perform.

2657
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:22,003
Um,

2658
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,333
yeah.

2659
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:27,640
When you start learning about
that stuff and take mushrooms,

2660
01:07:27,641 --> 01:07:28,700
it really opens your brain.

2661
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:31,900
Other different pathways and changes.

2662
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,810
How you looking at this?

2663
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:37,840
I think mushrooms are one of my
favorite things I've ever done.

2664
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:39,880
I've done mushrooms pray
five times and it's,

2665
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,811
it's,

2666
01:07:40,811 --> 01:07:41,231
we're right,

2667
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:41,831
right after that,

2668
01:07:41,831 --> 01:07:42,940
right after a mushroom trip,

2669
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:44,110
you feel you're so much more,

2670
01:07:44,111 --> 01:07:45,880
you realize everyone's going through shit.

2671
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:50,000
Like everyone is going through some and
make you want to be nicer to people and

2672
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:51,070
they just want to be kinder.

2673
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:55,150
And then I get four or five months later
you start getting a deer and wild ways

2674
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:55,481
and you're like,

2675
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:56,440
oh I need to do mushrooms again.

2676
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:57,873
Need a reset.

2677
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,320
Have you done DMT?

2678
01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:00,101
I have not.

2679
01:08:00,101 --> 01:08:03,100
I'm actually kind of scared to
do DMT cause I know like that,

2680
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:04,030
that's what I talk about my ego.

2681
01:08:04,031 --> 01:08:04,864
Like,

2682
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:06,370
like even mushrooms,

2683
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,920
they attack your ego almost Kinda,

2684
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,783
you know what I mean?

2685
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:11,223
And we need that.

2686
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:12,790
And I need that ego to keep,

2687
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:13,830
I dunno.

2688
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:14,010
It's,

2689
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:14,710
it's,

2690
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:15,830
you need your ego right now.

2691
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:16,040
So what

2692
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,370
you're saying,

2693
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:16,720
yeah,

2694
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,360
we got a new Connor's ego is huge.

2695
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:20,530
Con,

2696
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,820
you need to have a big ego.

2697
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:23,680
You need to have an ego
just to do anything.

2698
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:24,790
We are.

2699
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:25,623
Um,

2700
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:31,580
but is it the ego or do you need to
have the desire to achieve excellence?

2701
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:32,100
It.

2702
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,780
Is that always the ego?

2703
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:35,430
Can you do that without the self?

2704
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:37,320
Can you do that just as a task,

2705
01:08:37,321 --> 01:08:41,850
as a goal and be completely committed
and single minded in your approach to try

2706
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,080
to achieve excellence?

2707
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,910
Can you do that without the ego?

2708
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:46,440
Can you do it as a project?

2709
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,540
Can you do it as a task?

2710
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:49,261
I think so.

2711
01:08:49,261 --> 01:08:50,200
I think you can too.

2712
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:53,430
I don't care if you build this character
that I want to build this person,

2713
01:08:53,431 --> 01:08:54,264
this persona,

2714
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:55,860
but why do you want to build a persona?

2715
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,450
Cause you see Conor do it.

2716
01:08:57,750 --> 01:08:58,080
No,

2717
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:58,470
it's,

2718
01:08:58,470 --> 01:08:58,711
it's,

2719
01:08:58,711 --> 01:08:59,510
it's fun,

2720
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,840
right?

2721
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,110
This,

2722
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:01,890
it's the whole fight game is like that.

2723
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:02,724
It's just fun,

2724
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:03,090
right?

2725
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:03,923
Like I don't,

2726
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:05,341
plus,

2727
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:05,551
you know,

2728
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:06,540
if we build a persona,

2729
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,090
the bigger checks are going to cough,

2730
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,090
right?

2731
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:09,571
Yeah.

2732
01:09:09,571 --> 01:09:11,190
Like I'm not trying to not be me.

2733
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:12,540
Like everything I do is me.

2734
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:13,730
Like I just,

2735
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:14,581
I don't know.

2736
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:18,000
I enjoy trying to find a happy medium,

2737
01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:19,320
like a happy medium.

2738
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,510
I'm going to come on this podcast
later in life and I'll explain why.

2739
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,090
I'm just learning so much right now.

2740
01:09:25,091 --> 01:09:26,790
None of us feel like it's overwhelming

2741
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:27,750
or Smith,

2742
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,141
dude,

2743
01:09:28,141 --> 01:09:28,921
when I was your age,

2744
01:09:28,921 --> 01:09:30,150
I was a fucking idiot.

2745
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:30,811
You know,

2746
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:32,220
you're way ahead of the game.

2747
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,750
It's just a part of life.

2748
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,351
It's he is,

2749
01:09:34,351 --> 01:09:34,621
you know,

2750
01:09:34,621 --> 01:09:38,540
five years from now you've been in like
God back then I didn't know shit and

2751
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,620
then five years later you'd be like,

2752
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:40,290
ah,

2753
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:41,640
back then I didn't know shit.

2754
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:42,591
The more you learn,

2755
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:44,030
the more you realize you don't know.

2756
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,080
And then we get mad at her

2757
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:45,971
parents and stuff like,

2758
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:46,241
come on,

2759
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:46,901
please listen to me.

2760
01:09:46,901 --> 01:09:47,441
Eat healthy.

2761
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:48,490
Like read books.

2762
01:09:48,491 --> 01:09:48,970
I'm like,

2763
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,620
her parents didn't grow
up with the Internet.

2764
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,350
Like we're so lucky to
be learned from you guys.

2765
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:56,350
It's just impossible to
change people's ways.

2766
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,610
They have to want to change.

2767
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:58,960
They have to be motivated.

2768
01:09:58,961 --> 01:09:59,381
They have to.

2769
01:09:59,381 --> 01:09:59,561
It's,

2770
01:09:59,561 --> 01:10:01,510
it's so hard to change people.

2771
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,810
It's like if you've ever had a friend
that's been into drugs and it's been all

2772
01:10:04,811 --> 01:10:07,210
fucked up and you can't get
them to quit or an alcoholic,

2773
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,260
it is almost impossible to
talk someone into changing.

2774
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,110
They have to have some
motivation that's internal.

2775
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:14,680
Yeah.

2776
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,660
And that's the same
thing with eating good.

2777
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,470
The best example you could set is by
living your life in a healthy way.

2778
01:10:20,530 --> 01:10:20,771
Yeah.

2779
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:21,340
Fuck yeah.

2780
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,173
Yeah.

2781
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,400
That's one of the best
things about the internet.

2782
01:10:24,401 --> 01:10:28,000
You get to see all these people that are
doing things in a healthy way and doing

2783
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:31,510
things that are exciting and inspirational
and then it makes you want to do

2784
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:32,100
stuff.

2785
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,380
Yeah,

2786
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,040
that's good.

2787
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,410
And wakes,

2788
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:36,370
makes you want to take care of your
body and makes you really want to

2789
01:10:36,371 --> 01:10:40,240
concentrate on your mind and meditating
and just really get everything in order.

2790
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:40,870
Yeah,

2791
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:41,470
meditation.

2792
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,261
So awesome.

2793
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:46,130
It's really helping me every morning I
meditate for 10 minutes and I feel like

2794
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:50,120
it's helping me throughout the day
understand why certain thoughts are coming

2795
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:50,810
up,

2796
01:10:50,810 --> 01:10:54,800
whether it's from my childhood
traumas or just anything,

2797
01:10:54,801 --> 01:10:56,540
just certain patterns,

2798
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,290
my arm,

2799
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,130
cultural conditions,

2800
01:10:58,131 --> 01:10:58,671
thought patterns,

2801
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,421
cultural conditioning.

2802
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:03,530
Just meditating is helped me almost kind
of slow my brain down and redirect my

2803
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:07,100
thoughts if I get angry or something or
if something covens understanding of why

2804
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:09,740
I'm getting angry and I think I,

2805
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:10,281
and I'm so,

2806
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:11,120
cause I've been meditating.

2807
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,190
I did it for the Terry on verified did
for the honoree fight and I would do it

2808
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,690
randomly or in camp.

2809
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,643
I wouldn't do it all.

2810
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:17,520
And then now I'm doing it.

2811
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,740
I want it to be a part
of my life every morning.

2812
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:21,020
I've been doing it for
the last month alone.

2813
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,320
Do you do for 10 minutes?

2814
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,280
10 minutes every morning.

2815
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,480
And now how do you do it?

2816
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,140
Oh,

2817
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:25,800
I,

2818
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,150
I've been listening to Sam Harris,

2819
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,630
um,

2820
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:28,920
guided meditation on,

2821
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:33,690
there's an app called headspace that has
a bunch of packages that whether it's

2822
01:11:33,691 --> 01:11:34,081
stress,

2823
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:34,681
anxiety,

2824
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:35,514
sleep,

2825
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,781
um,

2826
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:37,770
positive thinking.

2827
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:38,041
Ah,

2828
01:11:38,041 --> 01:11:38,874
I just,

2829
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,590
I just do the guided meditations.

2830
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,420
I have all this little meditation room.

2831
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:43,254
I go down there,

2832
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,580
I first thing in the morning,

2833
01:11:44,581 --> 01:11:45,210
I get up,

2834
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,530
I put the lemon in the sea salt,

2835
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,393
I hydrate,

2836
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,530
I go into my meditation room,

2837
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:51,090
push play,

2838
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:52,290
sit there 10 minutes,

2839
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:53,213
meditate.

2840
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,001
Then I go outside water,

2841
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:55,110
my flowers in the morning routines.

2842
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,130
My favorite thing I need to,

2843
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:59,700
I wish everyone would have a morning
routine cause it's really like

2844
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:01,890
it,

2845
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,191
I don't know,

2846
01:12:02,191 --> 01:12:03,210
set you up for a good day.

2847
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:03,681
It does.

2848
01:12:03,681 --> 01:12:04,360
And just don't have,

2849
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:07,470
I don't remember the last time I had a
bad day and just morning routine sets me

2850
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:08,304
up for a good day.

2851
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,323
I love it.

2852
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:10,001
Yeah,

2853
01:12:10,001 --> 01:12:10,511
I agree.

2854
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:11,230
I agree.

2855
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:16,230
And routine John Danaher want wrote
some really fascinating piece on his

2856
01:12:16,751 --> 01:12:18,850
Instagram about routine,

2857
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:22,370
about how important it is
if you're a great athlete.

2858
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:22,840
He said,

2859
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,610
you find me a great athlete,

2860
01:12:24,611 --> 01:12:29,350
I'll find you someone who's
life is governed by routine
and that this is the way

2861
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:34,240
to check progress and this is the way to
constantly be moving towards your goal.

2862
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,201
And a,

2863
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:37,930
I remember reading that
and I said to myself,

2864
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:41,000
this is something that I've
always known but never vote.

2865
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:41,801
Verbalize.

2866
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:42,630
I've never said it.

2867
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,910
Yeah.

2868
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:44,710
But it's something that
I've always known like yeah,

2869
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:46,420
like everybody who's really good.

2870
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:51,450
I remember I were at a sports illustrated
article a long time ago about who's

2871
01:12:52,511 --> 01:12:57,190
that fucking track and field guy who
won the Olympics a bunch of times.

2872
01:12:57,191 --> 01:12:58,660
His name was something Moses,

2873
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:00,580
I forget his name,

2874
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,160
see you so you could find this guy's name.

2875
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:03,900
It was something,

2876
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,820
but he was like an elite
track and field guy.

2877
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:08,200
And uh,

2878
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:09,371
what's that?

2879
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:09,910
Edwin Moses.

2880
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:10,630
Edwin Moses.

2881
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:12,880
He was a beast and just super,

2882
01:13:12,881 --> 01:13:17,080
super disciplined and I remember
he had like this routine,

2883
01:13:17,081 --> 01:13:21,070
we had his notebook and he would lay his
notebook out and write down all of his

2884
01:13:21,071 --> 01:13:24,190
different routes and he had this like
Matt that he would lay down and he would

2885
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,960
do his stretching routines
and all this stuff.

2886
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,340
And I remember thinking like,

2887
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,151
Oh this guy,

2888
01:13:28,151 --> 01:13:28,990
this is his thing.

2889
01:13:28,991 --> 01:13:30,220
He does this all the time.

2890
01:13:30,221 --> 01:13:31,031
He just gets there.

2891
01:13:31,031 --> 01:13:32,770
He locks in and he does this.

2892
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,360
And this was many,

2893
01:13:34,361 --> 01:13:35,440
many years ago.

2894
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:38,530
I might have even still been
fighting when this was going on.

2895
01:13:38,531 --> 01:13:40,360
So I remember thinking about it going,

2896
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,111
okay,

2897
01:13:41,111 --> 01:13:42,040
like this kind of,

2898
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,670
this is like what elite
performers do when they,

2899
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,150
when they,

2900
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:49,600
when they're right at the
Olympics track and field,

2901
01:13:49,601 --> 01:13:50,740
it's so fucking boring.

2902
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,810
You're doing the same
shit you just running.

2903
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,370
Like you have to have a mind that to me,

2904
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:58,420
that steel to be able to do that same
stupid shit every day to try to get an

2905
01:13:58,421 --> 01:13:59,980
extra 10th of a second here.

2906
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:00,391
All right,

2907
01:14:00,391 --> 01:14:01,480
an eighth of a second there.

2908
01:14:01,481 --> 01:14:02,410
Fuck all that.

2909
01:14:02,411 --> 01:14:02,980
Right.

2910
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,760
But I remember thinking like it was too,

2911
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:09,970
it was at the same time horrifying to me
that someone would ever want to do the

2912
01:14:09,971 --> 01:14:12,820
same stupid shit and over again
until they won a gold medal.

2913
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:13,811
But at the same time,

2914
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:18,400
massively impressive that this
guy had this kind of iron will.

2915
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:23,670
There it is every time Edwin Moses places
feed on the blocks from 1977 and 1987

2916
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:24,940
he wants Moses,

2917
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:28,000
arguably the best hurdler
ever won 122 races,

2918
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:32,980
including a 107 consecutive finals
and set world records in the 400 meter

2919
01:14:32,981 --> 01:14:36,640
hurdles four times
within that 10 year span.

2920
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,890
His journey to the untouchable,

2921
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,420
to this untouchable level was marked by
personal innovation and determination,

2922
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:47,320
proving that elite coaching and state of
the art facilities are not required for

2923
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:49,240
supreme athletic success.

2924
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:50,530
And there was um,

2925
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:50,711
uh,

2926
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:53,230
believe it was sports illustrated
that had an article about this guy.

2927
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:58,231
And I remember just seeing him how
motivated I was seeing him stretching and

2928
01:14:58,721 --> 01:15:01,630
working out and going over his routine.

2929
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:03,640
And I was thinking to myself like,

2930
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:04,301
oh think about it.

2931
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:07,380
Every time I worked out that
like what would Moses to how it,

2932
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,080
yeah,

2933
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,550
how would Moses I got,

2934
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:09,781
I got,

2935
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:11,530
I got to start writing shit down.

2936
01:15:11,531 --> 01:15:15,010
I've got to start really thinking about
everything I do and I got to start

2937
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,220
putting it together on a
daily basis like he does.

2938
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:19,600
That's what Robert Falls,

2939
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:23,360
his favorite formula you'd always say
is consistency over time equals results

2940
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:24,510
favorite.

2941
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:25,720
And I got it tattooed on there.

2942
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,020
And it's funny cause like once you get
good at one thing you realize like fuck,

2943
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,370
I could get good at anything.

2944
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:35,371
And I know what it takes is fucking
consistency to Miyamoto Musashi.

2945
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:37,390
He wrote that in the book of five rings.

2946
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:39,040
Once you understand the way broadly,

2947
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:40,270
you will see it in all things.

2948
01:15:40,271 --> 01:15:41,104
Sweet.

2949
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:41,430
Sweet.

2950
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:42,030
Yeah.

2951
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:44,710
And that's a dude who fought
people without fucking sword.

2952
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,730
Oh God.

2953
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,020
That's this guy at dance.

2954
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,903
That's him.

2955
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:50,350
That's Musashi.

2956
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:51,583
Yeah.

2957
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,840
I read that book when I was like 15 or
16 or something like that and he wrote it

2958
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:57,970
in the 16 hundreds met Hailey.

2959
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:58,700
Yeah.

2960
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:02,200
Maybe it was the 14 hundreds I think
it was the 14 hundreds now that I think

2961
01:16:02,201 --> 01:16:02,870
about it.

2962
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:03,310
Ah,

2963
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,143
yeah.

2964
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:04,361
Yeah.

2965
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:05,194
He killed six.

2966
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,550
That's what the six number six was.

2967
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:09,730
He killed 60 people in
one on one sword fights,

2968
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:11,350
killed,

2969
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:12,370
killed.

2970
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,680
Who that in your mind set
going into one of them?

2971
01:16:14,681 --> 01:16:15,100
Yeah.

2972
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,140
Well he was a master at that.

2973
01:16:17,141 --> 01:16:17,291
Well,

2974
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:20,740
his thing was so fascinating and I always
recommend the book of five rings for

2975
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,810
fighters because one of
the things that it's,

2976
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:27,840
it's so crazy about it is his thing
was balanced is that you should be an

2977
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,553
artist,

2978
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:30,790
you should be a poet.

2979
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,500
You should be like,

2980
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,410
you should understand how to
write calligraphy like that.

2981
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:36,730
All these things are connected.

2982
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:38,920
You have to be in complete
control of your mind.

2983
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,200
You have to be in complete
control of your emotions.

2984
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:45,850
You have to have complete control of
artistic expression and that this was like

2985
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,160
the way to be a balance sword fighter.

2986
01:16:48,490 --> 01:16:52,390
Like his whole thing was that you can't
have any bullshit in your game like as a

2987
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:53,290
human being.

2988
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:58,210
You can't have any bullshit because when
you're dealing with one on one steel,

2989
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:02,860
fucking swords whizzing through
the air by trained murderers.

2990
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:03,671
I mean,

2991
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:07,870
he was the best at it and one of the
reasons why he was the best at it was this

2992
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,070
strict adherence to this Samurai

2993
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,440
way that he was not just a warrior,

2994
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:14,000
that to be a great warrior,

2995
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,450
you also had to be great and all of
these other things you had to have,

2996
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,610
you had to have a balanced perspective.

2997
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,050
You couldn't be a meathead,

2998
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:21,381
right?

2999
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:24,650
You couldn't bite down your mouthpiece
and let the chips fall where they may.

3000
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,930
That shit doesn't work
with sword fighting son.

3001
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:27,950
That's bullshit.

3002
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:30,110
Like it just like you said about GSP,

3003
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:32,660
like he's almost too smart.

3004
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:33,501
You're like,

3005
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:33,801
fuck,

3006
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:34,370
he sows.

3007
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:35,300
He's too smart.

3008
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:36,260
And sometimes in fighting,

3009
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:38,750
just like the dumb meatheads
go to a certain level,

3010
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:39,561
but just like he said,

3011
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:40,281
when you're real smart,

3012
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,480
you can go to a whole new level.

3013
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:42,314
Yeah.

3014
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:42,680
There's,

3015
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,710
there's a benefit to being a
meathead up to a certain point.

3016
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:46,190
Yeah.

3017
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:51,190
Especially if you can take a punch
because leaving the was a savage.

3018
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,560
There's a perfect example
when he met Anderson Silva,

3019
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,930
Anderson was like not today son,

3020
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,980
not today.

3021
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:59,630
Welcome to the next level.

3022
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,790
Give me several levels.

3023
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:04,340
You know that was brilliant.

3024
01:18:04,341 --> 01:18:05,420
Matchmaking by the way,

3025
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:09,320
by Joel silver when they introduced
Anderson and I was a giant Anderson fan

3026
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:14,321
before he fuck cause I was watching him
in pride where he was fighting well but

3027
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:15,180
then I knew he,

3028
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:16,490
I knew he was better than that.

3029
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,240
He was going through a lot of bullshit
and that's when he was with Moyie Thai

3030
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,510
Dream Team and I think he had already
left shoot to box at one point in time.

3031
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,570
But then he went over
and fought in cage rage.

3032
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:31,100
He fought in England and when he
fought in England I was like Holy Shit.

3033
01:18:31,370 --> 01:18:33,530
When you got to see when
he fought George Rivera,

3034
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,790
when he fought Lee Marie,

3035
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,500
you got to see how God damn good Anderson
really was when he was in his prime.

3036
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:41,210
So when he came into the UFC,

3037
01:18:41,211 --> 01:18:43,020
he was already in his thirties you know,

3038
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,140
and his first fight with leap,

3039
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:47,480
and I want to say it was like
32 33 something like that.

3040
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:47,791
Yeah.

3041
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:51,990
And it's oily and he let Chris Liebing
on fire and I remember watching it and

3042
01:18:51,991 --> 01:18:52,671
then I was saying this,

3043
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:52,881
I'm like,

3044
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:56,720
this is the perfect opponent for
Anderson Cause Lehman's an animal.

3045
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,070
He's a fucking warrior,

3046
01:18:58,071 --> 01:19:02,270
is going to bite down as mouthpiece and
come swinging and Anderson is going to

3047
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:07,271
be 15 steps ahead of him dissecting
him and different angles and degrees.

3048
01:19:07,311 --> 01:19:11,390
And as he comes forward he's just catching
them bank bank stepping over here,

3049
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:11,960
pop.

3050
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:12,620
Wow.

3051
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,910
And then it was over.

3052
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,230
It was like real quick.

3053
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:17,840
And that was the world's
introduction to Anderson Silva.

3054
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:19,040
Fucking crazy.

3055
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,060
Crazy mind.

3056
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:20,781
If I take a whiz boys,

3057
01:19:20,781 --> 01:19:20,931
yeah,

3058
01:19:20,931 --> 01:19:21,764
please go ahead.

3059
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:22,341
Yeah,

3060
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,890
Dude Anderson in his prime memes,

3061
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:25,550
Som thin special,

3062
01:19:25,551 --> 01:19:26,300
he was,

3063
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,890
he had achieved that state.

3064
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,221
You know,

3065
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:33,221
there's this elusive state of total flow
and he had achieved that against some

3066
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:35,090
of the best fighters in the world.

3067
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,080
You know when you see him when he was
at his very best and I just feel very

3068
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:41,270
fortunate to have been there
to watch some of those fights.

3069
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,780
I think fader in pride was probably,

3070
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,250
it's like him and Anderson.

3071
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:48,380
Those are the two all
time greats of that era.

3072
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:49,010
Right.

3073
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,560
And then mighty mouse who's
the all time great of this era.

3074
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:53,270
But what,

3075
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:58,271
what was so phenomenal about Anderson was
that you would just watch him hit that

3076
01:19:58,551 --> 01:19:59,480
flow state.

3077
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:00,051
You know,

3078
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:00,380
he would,

3079
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,150
he would size guys up to,

3080
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,920
you would see him move around.

3081
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:07,070
He would start moving around
who test you a little bit move.

3082
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,401
Yeah,

3083
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:10,410
we give you a minute or
two and you'd be like,

3084
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:10,591
man,

3085
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:11,281
I feel pretty good.

3086
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:12,330
I'm doing pretty good in this fight.

3087
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:14,900
And then all of a sudden he
started opening it up on your like,

3088
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:15,870
Oh shit,

3089
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:17,100
here comes here.

3090
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:19,640
Comes to so in the now and just react.

3091
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:20,490
I mean like he was,

3092
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:21,960
he's going to tell you is react thing.

3093
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:22,360
Yup.

3094
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,580
Wasn't thinking too much.

3095
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:24,450
Well when he sent,

3096
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:25,950
he tore up with that front kick.

3097
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:29,260
Fucking God damn nasty,

3098
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:29,970
nasty,

3099
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:30,390
nasty.

3100
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,260
But he just caught,

3101
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:33,000
he caught something to Vito was doing,

3102
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,770
if he toiled fight squared up,

3103
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:35,251
you know,

3104
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:35,961
he's always squared.

3105
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:36,920
We were talking about earlier,

3106
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:40,230
he always fought sorta squared up
because he would blitz guys and he always

3107
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:42,600
wanted to be able to sprawl
and shoot and take you down.

3108
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:44,550
So he had a very squared up style,

3109
01:20:44,551 --> 01:20:46,740
which made him open here and open here.

3110
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,100
You know,

3111
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:47,790
keep kicks.

3112
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,161
Yeah.

3113
01:20:48,161 --> 01:20:48,690
Favorite.

3114
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:49,170
Yeah.

3115
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,120
Well remember when he fought John Jones,

3116
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,790
John dropped him with the front
leg side kick to the body,

3117
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:55,561
if you remember that.

3118
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:56,040
I don't.

3119
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,370
Yeah,

3120
01:20:56,370 --> 01:21:00,630
John John Recognize that Vito
was standing square as well.

3121
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:03,690
And John hit him with a front leg side
kick right to the solar plexus and

3122
01:21:03,691 --> 01:21:04,290
dropped him.

3123
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,123
Fuck.

3124
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:07,170
And then Vituro caught
John with an arm bar.

3125
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,040
Uber.

3126
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:09,580
That fucking nasty,

3127
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,340
super hyper extended his arm.

3128
01:21:11,341 --> 01:21:13,590
That's where I knew John
was something special.

3129
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:13,700
Well,

3130
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:14,431
I knew before,

3131
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:15,540
but that's when,

3132
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:15,780
uh,

3133
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:16,680
in that fight I was like,

3134
01:21:16,681 --> 01:21:17,071
Jesus,

3135
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:18,570
this guy has not given up.

3136
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,310
His arm is fucked up.

3137
01:21:20,311 --> 01:21:20,611
How was it?

3138
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:21,160
Are Gnarly,

3139
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:21,993
dude,

3140
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:23,680
I was squealing and v toward,

3141
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:24,331
didn't let it go.

3142
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:24,870
Man.

3143
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,310
I mean,

3144
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:26,011
he let it go.

3145
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,590
Rather he didn't hold on to it.

3146
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:29,851
John got out of it.

3147
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:30,750
It's Craig in a fight again.

3148
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:31,620
You think John,

3149
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,153
I hope soon.

3150
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:34,350
Who is kicking?

3151
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:35,850
Alistair Overeem straight down the middle.

3152
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:38,550
They were talking about his square
stance and they knew that would be open,

3153
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:41,640
knocked out Alastair with
those front kicks in the UFC.

3154
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:42,420
That's all.

3155
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,080
Yeah.

3156
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:43,470
Yeah.

3157
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,920
I remember Greg Jackson
talking about that.

3158
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:50,400
Travis got back from being
fucking badly hurt in that fight.

3159
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:51,240
You remember that?

3160
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:51,451
I mean,

3161
01:21:51,451 --> 01:21:53,280
Travis was battered in that fight.

3162
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:54,870
His body was getting fucked up.

3163
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:57,150
Allister was blasted him
in the body with knees.

3164
01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:00,750
Travis was almost out of
it and just gutted it out.

3165
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:05,780
I still to this day feel like he
somehow or another missed his,

3166
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,430
his path.

3167
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:09,391
You know,

3168
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,440
I feel like Travis,

3169
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:11,520
when he was on,

3170
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:13,440
when he knocked out Stephan Struve,

3171
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:14,161
when you see,

3172
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:14,760
when he was,

3173
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,290
he used to fight different man.

3174
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,610
He was switching around.

3175
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,040
Yeah,

3176
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:18,870
switched gyms.

3177
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:19,920
When he's with Jackson's,

3178
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:21,330
he was moving around a lot.

3179
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:24,030
He was light on his feet
for whatever reason,

3180
01:22:24,031 --> 01:22:24,680
man.

3181
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,400
Can you decided to switch gyms
and became more boxers style,

3182
01:22:29,401 --> 01:22:30,410
flat footed.

3183
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:34,470
But I also think sometimes guys get to
the point where they just don't want to

3184
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:35,430
do it anymore.

3185
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:36,900
Or if they do want to do it,

3186
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:37,621
they don't want to do it.

3187
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:38,790
Like they used to want to do it.

3188
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:39,900
They kind of want to do it.

3189
01:22:39,901 --> 01:22:43,110
Maybe they kind of want to pay day or
maybe they just want to win so they feel

3190
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:43,861
better again.

3191
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:45,540
And then they'll pump themselves up again.

3192
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:46,920
And maybe I just get this one wind,

3193
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,300
I'll get back on track.

3194
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,050
But that,

3195
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:53,690
that weird space of not knowing my,

3196
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:53,931
uh,

3197
01:22:53,931 --> 01:22:54,180
my,

3198
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:54,271
uh,

3199
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:59,271
warrior am I looking to get out and my
look into that weird space is the worst

3200
01:22:59,431 --> 01:23:00,570
place it is.

3201
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:01,770
It's the worst place.

3202
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:02,120
Fight.

3203
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,080
Fighting is just so fucking tough too.

3204
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:05,010
You don't know what's going on.

3205
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,200
You,

3206
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,070
they could eat something.

3207
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,750
They could have thought about
puke in the whole night,

3208
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,141
could,

3209
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:08,510
uh,

3210
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,760
there's so much.

3211
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,121
Yeah,

3212
01:23:11,121 --> 01:23:11,700
I can see that.

3213
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,350
Girlfriend problems could
have family problems,

3214
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:15,320
you know,

3215
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:15,850
I mean,

3216
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,160
but I feel like Travis at his best,

3217
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,200
there was moments in his
career where I was like,

3218
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,063
this guy,

3219
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:22,420
I used to call them the dark horse.

3220
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:22,901
I was like,

3221
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:24,670
that guy's the dark horse
of the heavyweight division.

3222
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:25,840
He might be the champ one day.

3223
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,370
People are sleeping on him,

3224
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,840
but the movement,

3225
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:30,750
that guy had four fucking heavyweight.

3226
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,150
He was,

3227
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:35,290
he would see him switch and stances and
almost like TJ style movement flowing

3228
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:35,741
again.

3229
01:23:35,741 --> 01:23:36,910
Giant dude,

3230
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:37,744
man,

3231
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:38,021
man.

3232
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:39,700
Those deer legs when
they got going though,

3233
01:23:39,701 --> 01:23:40,270
Huh?

3234
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:40,960
Yeah,

3235
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,231
yeah.

3236
01:23:41,231 --> 01:23:42,250
That was a problem too.

3237
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:44,280
Well,

3238
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,450
that fight with our Lawsky.

3239
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,160
That was probably when
I was convinced that,

3240
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:48,461
you know,

3241
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,210
like maybe like the best times
of past him because just,

3242
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:52,890
I could,

3243
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,620
first of all,

3244
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:54,960
I guess him in our last few,

3245
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:57,280
sparred a lot at Jackson's and our Lawsky,

3246
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:02,350
although he's had a lot of wars and had
a lot of losses and been stopped a lot

3247
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:02,940
of times.

3248
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:04,510
You've got to remember
at one point in time,

3249
01:24:04,511 --> 01:24:07,750
our [inaudible] was a
real world class fighter,

3250
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:12,400
a heavyweight champion who everybody was
terrified of when he knocked out Paulb

3251
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:13,870
when Tello back in those days,

3252
01:24:13,871 --> 01:24:14,081
man,

3253
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:16,780
he had a piston of a right hand just boom,

3254
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:18,160
just throw it straight down the middle.

3255
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,990
And he was still skillful guy.

3256
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:22,780
So apparently in sparring he
would get the best of Travis.

3257
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:24,100
So like when they got together,

3258
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,200
like he had like serious
confidence in that fight.

3259
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,780
That was a slobber knocker
do you remember that fire?

3260
01:24:29,290 --> 01:24:31,150
One round of full chaos.

3261
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,740
Both guys got dropped.

3262
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:36,670
It was one of the craziest one round
heavyweight fights of all time and our

3263
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:37,930
Laskey wind up stopping them.

3264
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:38,830
It's so,

3265
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:41,890
it's so hard to pick those
heavyweight fights like any fight,

3266
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,660
whoever lands first,

3267
01:24:43,661 --> 01:24:44,494
you never know.

3268
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:45,400
Yeah.

3269
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,233
Hey can I guess,

3270
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:47,380
who do you think's gonna win?

3271
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:47,951
It's like fuck.

3272
01:24:47,951 --> 01:24:48,784
Who the fuck knows?

3273
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:50,801
What do you guys think of this?

3274
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:51,790
Colby Covington.

3275
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,100
A RDA fight this week for that Jack.

3276
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:55,420
I hope RDA bust him up.

3277
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:56,490
Well,

3278
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:57,700
Colby is doing what you said.

3279
01:24:57,701 --> 01:25:01,020
You want to talk in a lot of Shit and
getting a lot of people paying attention.

3280
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:01,810
I feel like he's,

3281
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:02,643
he's doing,

3282
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:03,490
I dunno.

3283
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:03,970
I Dunno.

3284
01:25:03,970 --> 01:25:04,990
He's doing what he's doing.

3285
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:07,300
It's paying people paying
attention for sure.

3286
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:08,080
Beat Maya,

3287
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,310
which is a huge accomplishment.

3288
01:25:09,311 --> 01:25:09,491
Right?

3289
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:10,390
My is still an APP.

3290
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:11,111
Absolutely.

3291
01:25:11,111 --> 01:25:12,100
World class fighter,

3292
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:17,320
but other than that really hasn't beaten
big name guys and he's fighting for the

3293
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:17,951
interim title.

3294
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:21,310
You've got to think that a lot of that
is because he's been very smart with

3295
01:25:21,311 --> 01:25:22,030
promotion.

3296
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:23,050
Telia had to hook.

3297
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,921
Oh yeah man.

3298
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:24,520
That's good.

3299
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,240
Fuck.

3300
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,370
That's going to be New Jersey for that.

3301
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,233
I don't have anybody,

3302
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,451
man.

3303
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:29,890
I'm in that same what we just said.

3304
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:30,790
Who the fuck knows?

3305
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:31,450
Yeah.

3306
01:25:31,450 --> 01:25:31,930
I liked,

3307
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,820
I liked the matchup though because Colby,

3308
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:34,850
first of all,

3309
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:37,870
Colby is not making one 55
unless he cuts a fucking leg off.

3310
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:39,040
He's a bigger guy.

3311
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:41,500
Rda was the 155 pound champion,

3312
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,281
so you have to think.

3313
01:25:42,281 --> 01:25:43,780
Colby is going to have a size advantage.

3314
01:25:43,781 --> 01:25:45,130
Colby is a very good wrestler.

3315
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:49,930
He's relentless and he
managed to do something that
very few people been able to

3316
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:52,720
do with Maya where he'd
just overwhelmed him,

3317
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:53,561
beat him up,

3318
01:25:53,561 --> 01:25:53,931
beat him up,

3319
01:25:53,931 --> 01:25:57,880
standing controlled where the fight took
place when a clear cut decision did it

3320
01:25:57,881 --> 01:26:01,900
in Brazil and did it after Woodley
did it and did it arguably better than

3321
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:02,730
Woodley did it,

3322
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,080
you know,

3323
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,130
was on top of Maya.

3324
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:07,640
It wasn't avoiding him in the
in a way that Woodley did,

3325
01:26:07,641 --> 01:26:08,870
but Whitley was injured in that fight.

3326
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:10,370
He hurt his shoulder
like in the first round.

3327
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,770
But it was an impressive performance.

3328
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:17,630
I mean if you go back and watch what my
was able to do with like Rick story with

3329
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,180
my has been able to do with Matt Brown,

3330
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:23,900
Maya's a fucking monster
when he gets a hold of you,

3331
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:28,130
it's such next level Jujitsu and Colby
was really never in trouble in that

3332
01:26:28,131 --> 01:26:28,610
fight.

3333
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:29,960
So you have to look at that and you go,

3334
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:30,530
okay,

3335
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:33,140
well obviously he has fantastic defense,

3336
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:38,120
solid wrestling base can strike on the
fee and knows how to like knows how to

3337
01:26:38,121 --> 01:26:39,320
fight a grimy,

3338
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:40,490
nasty fight.

3339
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:41,690
And he's the bigger guy.

3340
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:47,020
But then you look at Rda and Rda at
lightweight was a fucking mauler was just

3341
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:48,620
Merkin people.

3342
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:49,220
Right?

3343
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,440
But then you look at him at at
welterweight and you're like,

3344
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:52,011
Jesus,

3345
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:53,530
he might be better at welterweight.

3346
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:55,730
Look how good he looked
against Neil Magni.

3347
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:57,380
Everybody struggles with Neil Magni.

3348
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:58,950
He smashed Neil Magni,

3349
01:26:58,951 --> 01:26:59,784
took them down,

3350
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:00,651
leg kicked him,

3351
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:01,221
dropped him,

3352
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:01,971
get on top of them,

3353
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:02,804
strangle him.

3354
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:03,291
I mean,

3355
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:05,030
he beat the shit out of Robbie Lawler.

3356
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,950
The Robbie Lawler fight was crazy.

3357
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:11,270
Like he just overwhelmed one of the best
strikers in the welterweight division.

3358
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,210
Overwhelmed in from the outside
with angles and technique.

3359
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,480
So it's interesting men.

3360
01:27:17,510 --> 01:27:18,051
It's very,

3361
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:18,771
very interesting.

3362
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:19,640
It's very interesting.

3363
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:21,380
Some that aren't in Conor never fought.

3364
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:21,740
I know.

3365
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,380
I was so jack for the most exciting.

3366
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:25,910
I was so excited for that fight.

3367
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:27,650
Broke his fucking phone.

3368
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,590
You know he's going to be a
problem for a lot of people.

3369
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:30,830
Is that Gregor Gillespie?

3370
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:31,760
Oh yeah.

3371
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:32,401
Fucking do.

3372
01:27:32,401 --> 01:27:33,234
Oh yeah,

3373
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:35,060
the gift foxing four time.

3374
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:36,560
All American wa one time.

3375
01:27:36,561 --> 01:27:37,251
National Champ.

3376
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:38,840
Sugar tougher and shit.

3377
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,550
No holes this past weekend.

3378
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:40,851
Yeah,

3379
01:27:40,851 --> 01:27:41,630
I was there.

3380
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,850
Motherfuckers getting better and better.

3381
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:45,073
55 yeah,

3382
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:45,913
he's getting better.

3383
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:46,970
He's a beast.

3384
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:47,661
Yeah,

3385
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:47,901
Dude.

3386
01:27:47,901 --> 01:27:48,830
He's relentless.

3387
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:49,933
He's a beast.

3388
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:50,161
Yeah,

3389
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:50,420
he's,

3390
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,980
he's fucking real solid,

3391
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,061
real solid.

3392
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:53,211
And,

3393
01:27:53,211 --> 01:27:54,200
and Scott that look,

3394
01:27:54,201 --> 01:27:54,471
you know,

3395
01:27:54,471 --> 01:27:55,304
just super,

3396
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:57,170
super focused and tense.

3397
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:57,950
You know,

3398
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:02,450
there's just so much
talent right now in MMA.

3399
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:03,800
It's just such a great time.

3400
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:04,960
It's growing fast too.

3401
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:07,580
Like watching the little
kid that the lab train.

3402
01:28:07,581 --> 01:28:07,821
I'm like,

3403
01:28:07,821 --> 01:28:08,840
Holy Yeah.

3404
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:12,350
You'll see a little kids hitting a flying
armbars and shit and Benson Henderson

3405
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:12,351
Sun.

3406
01:28:12,351 --> 01:28:13,550
It's going to be an animal.

3407
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:16,040
Told Z he was he two to three.

3408
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:17,930
He's throwing hooks,

3409
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:18,381
smiling,

3410
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:18,910
showed up,

3411
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:19,743
legs

3412
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,003
doing.

3413
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:22,410
I don't know.

3414
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:25,520
He's developing that way as a little kid.

3415
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,230
Just from the time you're little,

3416
01:28:27,231 --> 01:28:29,000
your body's developing,

3417
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:31,130
throwing punches and kicks
and then haven't bent.

3418
01:28:31,131 --> 01:28:33,450
And as your dad teaching your
mentality your whole life.

3419
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,370
Fuck man.

3420
01:28:35,270 --> 01:28:35,781
Crazy.

3421
01:28:35,781 --> 01:28:36,510
Going to be so many.

3422
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:39,020
Daisy put Benson to
sleep and shave his head.

3423
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:40,533
A hub.

3424
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:42,110
It's fucking hair's
always getting in the way.

3425
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,190
He shaved his head,

3426
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,023
just shave his head.

3427
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,541
Just put,

3428
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:45,374
put them under.

3429
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:46,850
Just just put them on a day.

3430
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:48,290
Wake up with a shaved head.

3431
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,581
Come on man.

3432
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:50,590
I know it's kind of your luck,

3433
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:52,070
but the fuck outta here with that.

3434
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:54,620
I was always doing this and
curled my hair last fight.

3435
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:55,551
I know.

3436
01:28:55,551 --> 01:28:56,384
Look good.

3437
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:56,970
God,

3438
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:57,803
it's him.

3439
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,940
Shit gets in the way.

3440
01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,720
It does.

3441
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,890
And the constantly doing that.

3442
01:29:00,891 --> 01:29:01,724
I yeah,

3443
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,870
liquid rose did.

3444
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:04,640
She's like fuck.

3445
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,460
He said fuck it.

3446
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:06,360
Fuck I'm man,

3447
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:07,563
she's a beast.

3448
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,620
She's gorgeous too.

3449
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:09,030
Yes,

3450
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:09,451
she really,

3451
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:10,620
and she doesn't play it up at all,

3452
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:11,743
which is yeah.

3453
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:12,640
Yeah,

3454
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:13,080
she's cool.

3455
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:13,913
Super honest.

3456
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:16,860
It's going to be interesting
for who we get for sugar next.

3457
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:18,750
Cause it's probably
gonna be a five rounder.

3458
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:20,340
Well not what I was thinking.

3459
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,740
Cause I'm originally
after that last fight,

3460
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:24,840
after that last fight when
we went to the hospital,

3461
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:25,910
the Ama,

3462
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:27,150
the post fight conference,

3463
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:27,800
Dana White took,

3464
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,260
uh,

3465
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:31,310
they said John's fight foot's fine because
at the hospital they said there was

3466
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,290
nothing wrong with my foot
and the Dana Psych said that.

3467
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,430
So I was thinking like,

3468
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:35,611
oh,

3469
01:29:35,611 --> 01:29:35,821
okay.

3470
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:36,750
I guess nothing drawn my foot.

3471
01:29:36,751 --> 01:29:39,540
I guess I'm going to fight because
they x rayed it with my foot up.

3472
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:39,721
Not,

3473
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:40,980
I get not flat on the surface.

3474
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,030
Um,

3475
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:43,680
so I suppose we're
going to fight July six.

3476
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,590
I was going a headline
that card at us at a Sonia,

3477
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,120
Sonia,

3478
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,440
he's headlining that card.

3479
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,920
I was supposed to I suppose to a headline
that car and I was so excited for

3480
01:29:52,921 --> 01:29:53,640
that.

3481
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,473
Um,

3482
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:55,680
so that because they
wanted me to headline,

3483
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:58,470
but I think next fight is going
to be October 6th in Vegas,

3484
01:29:58,480 --> 01:29:59,313
the paper view.

3485
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,150
Um,

3486
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,740
hopefully you get to get on that card.

3487
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:03,660
But then after that I would
like to headline my own.

3488
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:04,913
Oh sweet.

3489
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:08,910
So I would like to fight two more
times by the end of the year Hulings

3490
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,780
everything's going good.

3491
01:30:09,781 --> 01:30:12,420
So I think October six
and then maybe November,

3492
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:13,150
December.

3493
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:14,000
So you sweet.

3494
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:17,010
How do you decide when you're ready to go?

3495
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,540
Full blast again with your foot.

3496
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:19,453
Just bow.

3497
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:22,130
Do you go to a doctor and
get it looked at again?

3498
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:22,850
Get an MRI,

3499
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:23,920
make sure everything's back in place.

3500
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:24,210
Got A,

3501
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:27,240
I got an x ray last time and
they said everything looks good.

3502
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,370
Come back and four weeks
and we'll clear you.

3503
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:30,300
But I'm really just,

3504
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:31,134
I'm not going to listen to,

3505
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:32,070
like,

3506
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:35,670
I know how my foot feels like there's
days where it's really sore and there's

3507
01:30:35,671 --> 01:30:36,151
days I'm like,

3508
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:36,331
dude,

3509
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:36,870
it's good.

3510
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:37,800
But I know it's just,

3511
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:38,521
I feel like,

3512
01:30:38,521 --> 01:30:38,821
like I said,

3513
01:30:38,821 --> 01:30:39,271
about 80,

3514
01:30:39,271 --> 01:30:40,104
85%,

3515
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:40,610
um,

3516
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:41,130
and be like,

3517
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:41,431
okay,

3518
01:30:41,431 --> 01:30:42,264
today,

3519
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:43,140
today it's a little,

3520
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:43,401
it was,

3521
01:30:43,401 --> 01:30:44,820
so we hit mits yesterday,

3522
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:45,360
um,

3523
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,111
and I lifted yesterday,

3524
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:47,130
so it's a little bit sore,

3525
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:48,150
but it's like a,

3526
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:49,530
it's like a sore from not using it,

3527
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:51,450
not like a sore from Osha injury.

3528
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:51,870
Right.

3529
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:52,670
So I think it's,

3530
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:52,950
it's,

3531
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,491
it's been Heelan.

3532
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:53,911
Awesome.

3533
01:30:53,911 --> 01:30:54,511
I think everything,

3534
01:30:54,511 --> 01:30:55,560
I've been doing everything right.

3535
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:56,020
So,

3536
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:56,610
um,

3537
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:57,301
I would say at three,

3538
01:30:57,301 --> 01:30:57,871
four more weeks,

3539
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,130
I'll be ready to go 100%.

3540
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:01,170
Did you see the Marlin Mariah's fight?

3541
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:01,920
I,

3542
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,221
I did.

3543
01:31:02,221 --> 01:31:03,240
I seen the highlight of it.

3544
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,220
So it pretty much the whole
fight was the 34 seconds,

3545
01:31:05,250 --> 01:31:10,250
height ood beautiful switch switch kit
that much just because they're so like

3546
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:12,360
the person has to be coming forward.

3547
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:13,680
The distance and MMA,

3548
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:15,510
so much different than
kickboxing and stuff.

3549
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:15,950
We'll switch.

3550
01:31:15,950 --> 01:31:17,730
Cars aren't that great.

3551
01:31:17,731 --> 01:31:18,301
But man,

3552
01:31:18,301 --> 01:31:18,420
he,

3553
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:19,680
I kids fucking lightning.

3554
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,060
He's a bad motherfucker.

3555
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,923
How tall is he?

3556
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:23,090
Short.

3557
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:23,301
Five.

3558
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:24,840
Five or something like that.

3559
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:25,531
You wouldn't be able to touch.

3560
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:26,341
And Jimmy Rivera,

3561
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:26,601
what is,

3562
01:31:26,601 --> 01:31:27,510
he's a little shorter than him.

3563
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,600
They're both around the same side.

3564
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:29,911
Five,

3565
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:31,320
six in that range.

3566
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:31,760
I'm going to give,

3567
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,240
I'm going to give all these dudes trouble.

3568
01:31:33,241 --> 01:31:34,500
I'm just gonna be so long.

3569
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:35,300
They're not going to get,

3570
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:35,590
they're going to,

3571
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,421
you can't train for you.

3572
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:37,254
That's the problem.

3573
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,540
We can't train for you cause
there's not many people can swim.

3574
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:42,900
I love about going into
all my fights out there.

3575
01:31:42,901 --> 01:31:45,570
So confident and just cause I
feel like you can watch me on TV.

3576
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:46,404
You can see,

3577
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:47,041
oh yeah,

3578
01:31:47,041 --> 01:31:47,701
he's fast.

3579
01:31:47,701 --> 01:31:48,121
He does this,

3580
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:48,690
does that.

3581
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,310
We didn't tell him in front
of you and I'm doing it.

3582
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:51,180
I feel like it's another,

3583
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:52,920
another level of speed that they're not,

3584
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,330
they they're not prepared for.

3585
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:56,950
And I truly believe that like,

3586
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:57,631
and I truly,

3587
01:31:57,631 --> 01:31:59,950
every fight that go into
that last fight I would,

3588
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,870
I was 100% confident.

3589
01:32:01,871 --> 01:32:02,704
We're gonna knock him out.

3590
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,060
I didn't knock him out,

3591
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:05,230
but I,

3592
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:08,650
if I had a couple more seconds in that
first round and you're so skinny and

3593
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:09,980
goofy look and people on

3594
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:13,990
people public fuck was sugar eyeball.

3595
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:14,824
I'm like,

3596
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:15,460
Hey,

3597
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,320
remember that guy at our apartment?

3598
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:18,520
We had our first apartment,

3599
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:20,500
there's this big jacked
guy with a wife beater,

3600
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:20,771
and we're like,

3601
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:20,921
oh,

3602
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:22,060
we're both professional fighters.

3603
01:32:22,061 --> 01:32:24,010
He's like that kid to
professional fighter.

3604
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:24,970
He's like,

3605
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:26,090
I don't want to be a professional fighter.

3606
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:26,411
I'm like,

3607
01:32:26,411 --> 01:32:26,561
well,

3608
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:27,580
he come spar sugar.

3609
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:29,110
At the time I was working at the UFC gym,

3610
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:30,013
I got a key.

3611
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:30,780
He's like,

3612
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,031
all right,

3613
01:32:31,031 --> 01:32:33,280
I'll be there fucking little
jack with wife beater.

3614
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:33,491
I'm like,

3615
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:33,731
okay,

3616
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:34,450
perfect.

3617
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:35,470
So sugar comes out,

3618
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:38,860
Tito isn't gonna try to teat kicks him
right in the way and then ringing and I'm

3619
01:32:38,861 --> 01:32:40,270
recording it and the guy goes,

3620
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:40,601

3621
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:42,100

3622
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,260
Big Kick right to the guts.

3623
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:49,160
Boom poop popel at his pants
in the ring and I wasn't,

3624
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:50,590
I wasn't hitting him in the head hard.

3625
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:50,920
I was,

3626
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:51,701
I was conscious of,

3627
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:52,900
I'm not trying to hurt this guy.

3628
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:55,610
What did you train at all or
was he never dominant fighter?

3629
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,390
I wasn't dying Jack Prison Guy.

3630
01:32:58,391 --> 01:32:58,850
Like,

3631
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:02,590
like looked hard thought
after we weird boys after.

3632
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:03,570
Yeah,

3633
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:04,061
and it wasn't,

3634
01:33:04,061 --> 01:33:04,270
we were,

3635
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:05,350
I wasn't being a bully.

3636
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:05,890
We was like,

3637
01:33:05,890 --> 01:33:06,940
you want to smell like you sure.

3638
01:33:06,970 --> 01:33:07,191
Yeah,

3639
01:33:07,191 --> 01:33:07,410
yeah.

3640
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:07,960
Oh yeah.

3641
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,321
And it wasn't,

3642
01:33:08,321 --> 01:33:09,190
I didn't hurt him.

3643
01:33:09,191 --> 01:33:10,630
I did hit him with the
hard body kicking him.

3644
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:11,230
He Shit himself.

3645
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:11,980
But I wasn't,

3646
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:12,820
I wasn't being a bully.

3647
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:13,991
No,

3648
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:15,550
not at all in the ring though.

3649
01:33:15,551 --> 01:33:16,810
And they smeared it all around.

3650
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,210
So that smeared it all
around and we stepped on it.

3651
01:33:19,211 --> 01:33:19,990
They didn't know we didn't,

3652
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:20,830
we didn't know.

3653
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:22,120
We thought it was a dog.

3654
01:33:22,121 --> 01:33:22,630
Fuck.

3655
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:23,140
Oh,

3656
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,780
we thought it was a dog
we bought into the town.

3657
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:26,050
Anybody that he shit himself.

3658
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,620
No.

3659
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,301
And I told him,

3660
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:27,581
I was like,

3661
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:27,791
dude,

3662
01:33:27,791 --> 01:33:28,230
Tony,

3663
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:29,063
shoot yourself.

3664
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:30,071
He's like,

3665
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:30,221
no,

3666
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:30,820
that wasn't me.

3667
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,840
But I had it on my phone.

3668
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,890
It was your wash the
poop out of assurance.

3669
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,840
And then the boys smeared around,

3670
01:33:39,370 --> 01:33:40,450
but it's clean it up.

3671
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:41,800
He didn't look and mopped it.

3672
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,740
But it's funny,

3673
01:33:44,741 --> 01:33:46,000
like in public,

3674
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,130
people always eyeball.

3675
01:33:47,230 --> 01:33:47,680
We're like,

3676
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:50,470
what little bitch people are gross.

3677
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,111
Yeah.

3678
01:33:51,111 --> 01:33:53,500
It was a lot of people out
there trying to chest puff.

3679
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,423
I know.

3680
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,243
Whatever.

3681
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:58,233
Keep it moving.

3682
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:58,840
Yeah.

3683
01:33:58,840 --> 01:33:59,591
Take care of folks.

3684
01:33:59,591 --> 01:34:00,080
Bye Bye.

3685
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:00,780
Yeah.

3686
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,210
Yup.

3687
01:34:01,210 --> 01:34:01,510
Yeah.

3688
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,500
Stay out of trouble man.

3689
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:03,520
You got a bright future.

3690
01:34:03,790 --> 01:34:04,211
Thank you.

3691
01:34:04,211 --> 01:34:05,044
Yeah.

3692
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:06,610
I feel like I'm staying out of trouble.

3693
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:07,140
No,

3694
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,080
I feel like you are too.

3695
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:10,660
It's sometimes trouble
gets in your way though.

3696
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:11,903
Vegas,

3697
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:12,893
Vegas.

3698
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:13,910
I'm in a,

3699
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:15,550
I've been there a few times.

3700
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:16,540
Um,

3701
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:16,810
when,

3702
01:34:16,810 --> 01:34:20,140
when my last time I went
to a pool party and it was,

3703
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,460
it was dangerously fun.

3704
01:34:21,461 --> 01:34:21,701
I was like,

3705
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:22,061
Oh shit,

3706
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:22,894
I can't live here.

3707
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:24,303
I can't fall.

3708
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,270
I wanted to,

3709
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:26,103
I had to like,

3710
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:27,110
oh,

3711
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:28,370
I've got a little buzz.

3712
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:30,670
The women everywhere drinking,

3713
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:31,504
dancing.

3714
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:32,681
I'm like,

3715
01:34:32,681 --> 01:34:33,550
this is what he thinks.

3716
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:35,530
Should we take a couple rips right now?

3717
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:36,690
Okay.

3718
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:37,210
Um,

3719
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:37,931
I actually got a,

3720
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:39,060
I got some sugar show.

3721
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:39,311
Gee,

3722
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:39,821
this is a,

3723
01:34:39,821 --> 01:34:40,660
you got it on you.

3724
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:43,330
So this is going to be
for sale next Tuesday.

3725
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:45,123
Yeah.

3726
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,960
Who's making atrium?

3727
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:48,340
California.

3728
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:48,611
Um,

3729
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:49,301
I met these guys,

3730
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:51,640
so I met these guys in Fresno,

3731
01:34:51,641 --> 01:34:52,091
California.

3732
01:34:52,091 --> 01:34:53,980
We were there for our
buddy hot sauces fight.

3733
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:55,203
Um,

3734
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,290
I posted on Instagram,

3735
01:34:56,291 --> 01:34:56,501
I said,

3736
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:56,591
hey,

3737
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:57,830
does anyone some some weed?

3738
01:34:57,831 --> 01:34:58,280
I get

3739
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,270
these guys messaged me.

3740
01:34:59,480 --> 01:34:59,960
They,

3741
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:00,560
they came to me,

3742
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:01,393
had like a,

3743
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,920
a beautiful little setup
with some weed in it,

3744
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:05,420
some cartridges and I was like,

3745
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:05,631
damn,

3746
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:06,620
these guys are good company.

3747
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,270
There would be good kind of beginning to,

3748
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:11,570
and they're super passionate about
wanting to get into the industry.

3749
01:35:11,571 --> 01:35:14,260
So then they made this and uh,

3750
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:17,350
the industry meaning the MMA and
just like cannabis industry there,

3751
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:18,193
they're going to be,

3752
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,190
they have some,

3753
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,090
they have six,

3754
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:22,190
I think they won six awards
in the high times this year.

3755
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,353
Um,

3756
01:35:23,620 --> 01:35:23,870
they're,

3757
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:24,261
they're amazing.

3758
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:24,561
I got you.

3759
01:35:24,561 --> 01:35:25,131
I got you some,

3760
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:25,770
let me tell you something

3761
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:26,990
about high times awards.

3762
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:27,620
Let's say,

3763
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:30,320
cause I was a judge at
one of the cannabis cups.

3764
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:32,500
Nobody knows what the fuck sir.

3765
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:37,500
Judging and everybody's a high out of
their mind is this is what they did the

3766
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,390
day that I judged.

3767
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:39,800
They gave me,

3768
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:42,650
you never see one of them
pill boxes the people get,

3769
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:44,150
whether it's like Monday,

3770
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:44,150
Tuesday,

3771
01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:44,330
Wednesday,

3772
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,920
and then like each one is like,

3773
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:46,813
you know,

3774
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:47,750
yeah.

3775
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:48,583
Um,

3776
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:52,460
each one of those had like a little label
on it and each one of them was like,

3777
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:52,701
you know,

3778
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,500
this is like fucking superstar.

3779
01:35:54,501 --> 01:35:55,340
Oh Gee,

3780
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:56,660
this is death crack.

3781
01:35:56,661 --> 01:35:57,494
This is,

3782
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,100
I dunno what the fuck I was smoking
by the time I was on the third one.

3783
01:36:01,370 --> 01:36:04,370
I was on another planet.

3784
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:04,760
Man.

3785
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:05,710
I mean it's a,

3786
01:36:05,711 --> 01:36:07,340
it's weird like,

3787
01:36:07,341 --> 01:36:07,930
like I had,

3788
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:11,870
I had separated the membrane between this
dimension and the next and I was like

3789
01:36:11,871 --> 01:36:13,940
pushed through like trying to act normal.

3790
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,820
Just trying to be nobody
who was acting normal.

3791
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:17,001
Man.

3792
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:17,870
It was real weird.

3793
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:19,310
I'll never forget the conversations,

3794
01:36:19,311 --> 01:36:20,690
what I was having with
some of these people.

3795
01:36:21,110 --> 01:36:22,140
That is the fucking odd.

3796
01:36:22,180 --> 01:36:22,780
This the here,

3797
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:23,040
here,

3798
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,040
here's your own little joint.

3799
01:36:25,460 --> 01:36:28,520
This stuff's a cross between
Lemonhead in [inaudible] 92 it's cool.

3800
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:29,650
It's a very,

3801
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:30,483
is good.

3802
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:31,750
The lemon,

3803
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,500
but you know,

3804
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:33,490
in this day and age,

3805
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:33,850
man,

3806
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:36,220
I feel like everybody's weed is good.

3807
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:36,881
Yeah.

3808
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:39,820
I can't remember was the
last time I found bad weed.

3809
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,600
Yeah,

3810
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:42,220
it's doesn't exist anymore.

3811
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:42,841
Seriously.

3812
01:36:42,841 --> 01:36:46,470
A little ass trash tree
should be one lane here.

3813
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:48,520
Oh,

3814
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,330
perfect.

3815
01:36:49,330 --> 01:36:49,541
Yeah.

3816
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:50,060
Seriously.

3817
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:50,651
Day and age.

3818
01:36:50,651 --> 01:36:52,120
Who the fuck I was bad weed.

3819
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:52,954
It's like,

3820
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:53,741
it's everywhere.

3821
01:36:53,741 --> 01:36:55,030
Even you go all the way to New York.

3822
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,530
New York is still illegal.

3823
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,810
It's so strange.

3824
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:58,540
We are friends.

3825
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:58,691
Yeah.

3826
01:36:58,691 --> 01:36:59,950
My friend Ari lives in New York.

3827
01:36:59,951 --> 01:37:02,680
It's like you can get arrested
if you're smoking on the street.

3828
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:03,850
Dude,

3829
01:37:03,850 --> 01:37:05,110
we were supposed to go to Singapore,

3830
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:05,711
but not now.

3831
01:37:05,711 --> 01:37:07,230
They're not sending us their UFC.

3832
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,950
I was going to go to Singapore for
the Singapore Card or Singapore.

3833
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,880
Keep getting made fun of
for Santa Wrong Singapore.

3834
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:13,421
Um,

3835
01:37:13,421 --> 01:37:14,960
but sorry to um,

3836
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,020
they said that you can get tested
randomly off the street for,

3837
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,150
for weed and you can go to prison.

3838
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:24,790
Why so UFC decided not to send me,

3839
01:37:25,120 --> 01:37:25,660
wait a minute.

3840
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,310
Who randomly tests you?

3841
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:30,040
I don't know that my manager
called me and they said,

3842
01:37:30,041 --> 01:37:33,010
hey UFC at a little meeting they
said they decided not to bring,

3843
01:37:33,040 --> 01:37:34,480
they don't really want
you to go down there.

3844
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,540
You can get tested randomly and
go to prison if you test for weed.

3845
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:38,000
So

3846
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,720
whoa,

3847
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:38,840
yes,

3848
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,431
we're not going but,

3849
01:37:39,431 --> 01:37:39,860
but,

3850
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:41,030
but here's the reality.

3851
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:45,450
That means that literally like 70% of
the UFC fucking roster could go out and

3852
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,360
test it for weeding.

3853
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:46,600
Yeah,

3854
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,180
for sure.

3855
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:48,013
All the coaches,

3856
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,070
but what?

3857
01:37:49,070 --> 01:37:49,820
We're going to Canada,

3858
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:50,061
I'm a,

3859
01:37:50,061 --> 01:37:51,050
I wasn't that funny man.

3860
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,600
That's a thing about the
misconception about marijuana.

3861
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:55,141
You know,

3862
01:37:55,141 --> 01:37:55,920
people think like,

3863
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,920
oh stoners are lazy and it's like a
giant percentage of the UFC roster smoked

3864
01:38:01,621 --> 01:38:03,480
pot on a fairly regular basis.

3865
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:06,180
I mean even NFL and sports in general.

3866
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:06,780
Yeah.

3867
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,080
Look,

3868
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:11,280
I mean especially if you've got
injuries and you want to relax and CBD,

3869
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:12,570
just CBD alone.

3870
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:14,610
God Damn fucking everybody shoes that.

3871
01:38:14,611 --> 01:38:15,361
I have a buddy of mine,

3872
01:38:15,361 --> 01:38:18,120
my friend Aaron and he
was taking Ibuprofen.

3873
01:38:18,121 --> 01:38:19,080
He was taking it all the time.

3874
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:19,261
I go,

3875
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:19,471
man,

3876
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:20,201
you got to listen to me.

3877
01:38:20,201 --> 01:38:21,630
He stopped taking that shit.

3878
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,111
I go,

3879
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:27,111
just get some CBD and just take it
orally and then also rub it on whatever's

3880
01:38:27,181 --> 01:38:28,014
bothering you.

3881
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:29,260
And he did.

3882
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:29,611
And he's like,

3883
01:38:29,611 --> 01:38:29,880
dude,

3884
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:30,661
11 days,

3885
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:31,470
no pain.

3886
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:31,950
He goes,

3887
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:35,460
I can't believe I've been taking this
fucking Ibuprofen forever and now he's

3888
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:36,690
just taking CBD oil.

3889
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,500
It's crazy.

3890
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:37,861
Nothing,

3891
01:38:37,861 --> 01:38:38,850
nothing negative.

3892
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:39,270
No,

3893
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:41,590
it doesn't fuck your gut bacteria up.

3894
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:42,780
It doesn't ruin your body,

3895
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:45,030
doesn't get you high.

3896
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:46,050
It doesn't do anything bad.

3897
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:47,760
Rhonda goes off about Ibuprofen.

3898
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:49,500
Doesn't she run a Patrick say,

3899
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:50,160
yeah,

3900
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:52,500
she was telling me how bad
it is for your gut bacteria.

3901
01:38:52,590 --> 01:38:53,400
Seriously.

3902
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:54,030
Gut Bacteria.

3903
01:38:54,030 --> 01:38:55,340
I feel like it's one
of the most important,

3904
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:58,830
obviously one of most important things
that people just don't really know about.

3905
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:01,050
I think if I can tell,

3906
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:01,801
if I take,

3907
01:39:01,801 --> 01:39:03,060
if I have enough probiotics for the day,

3908
01:39:03,061 --> 01:39:04,300
I can tell I got to hold.

3909
01:39:04,301 --> 01:39:05,940
It feels way better than if I don't.

3910
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,641
I Love Camp Bucci.

3911
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:07,474
You'll love it.

3912
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,633
Drink it every day.

3913
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:10,350
So try that.

3914
01:39:10,351 --> 01:39:11,310
New Watermelon flavor.

3915
01:39:11,311 --> 01:39:12,240
The gts kind?

3916
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:12,811
No,

3917
01:39:12,811 --> 01:39:17,811
I only mostly have either the really green
one or the gingerade or the original.

3918
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:18,810
Oh,

3919
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:22,470
those are the original
trilogy is good too.

3920
01:39:22,471 --> 01:39:23,304
I liked that one too.

3921
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:24,690
Sometimes like the grapes,

3922
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:25,610
the grapes had a lot,

3923
01:39:25,611 --> 01:39:26,880
a little bit too much sugar in it,

3924
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:27,391
I think.

3925
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:27,890
Oh does it?

3926
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:30,240
It's sweet if you look at
how much sugar is in there,

3927
01:39:30,360 --> 01:39:31,770
but still super,

3928
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:34,060
super good for your body probiotics there.

3929
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:39,290
So my friend Cameron Hanes is an ultra
marathon runner and he was heavily hooked

3930
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:40,290
on Ibuprofen.

3931
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:42,000
He was taking 800 milligrams a day,

3932
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,070
sometimes more than once a day.

3933
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:45,600
And uh,

3934
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,400
I did the podcast with Rhonda and Doctor
Rhonda Patrick was going over all the

3935
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:54,690
dangers of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories
and Ibuprofen and talking about the

3936
01:39:54,691 --> 01:39:56,550
increased risk of strokes and
all these different things.

3937
01:39:56,550 --> 01:39:57,420
And I called him up.

3938
01:39:57,421 --> 01:39:57,601
I go,

3939
01:39:57,601 --> 01:39:57,931
dude,

3940
01:39:57,931 --> 01:39:59,940
you got to get off that shit right now.

3941
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:00,541
I go,

3942
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:01,710
that stuff's terrible for you.

3943
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:03,450
So here's where it gets crazy.

3944
01:40:03,451 --> 01:40:07,110
He gets off of it and all
of his pain goes away.

3945
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:11,280
So the reason why he was taking
it was because he was in pain.

3946
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:12,270
I'm good shit.

3947
01:40:12,271 --> 01:40:12,810
Seriously.

3948
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:13,350
And,

3949
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,690
um,

3950
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:15,990
for him at least his,

3951
01:40:15,991 --> 01:40:19,320
the inflammation that it was causing him
probably because he's taking too much

3952
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:20,070
as well.

3953
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:20,251
You know,

3954
01:40:20,251 --> 01:40:21,180
a lot of people think like,

3955
01:40:21,181 --> 01:40:21,421
Hey,

3956
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:22,290
it says take two,

3957
01:40:22,291 --> 01:40:23,124
I'll take sick.

3958
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:24,450
Right.

3959
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:25,470
And when you do that,

3960
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:27,990
you're torching your fucking gut bacteria.

3961
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:31,950
So he's creating all this
internal inflammation which
is in turn leading to all

3962
01:40:31,951 --> 01:40:35,040
this pain which has in turn
making want to take Ibuprofen.

3963
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:36,210
Dan.

3964
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:38,850
Yeah dude it and that's our
like lucky to have friends.

3965
01:40:38,970 --> 01:40:42,060
That was it as help each other like
mandatory drug testing in Singapore,

3966
01:40:42,061 --> 01:40:45,870
you can be dragged into custody without
a warrant and be compelled to submit to

3967
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:50,871
drug testing by Singapore authorities
as Singaporean drug counselor and x

3968
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:51,511
detainee.

3969
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:54,030
Tony Tan explains for
the first time you're

3970
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,770
caught or for drug
consumption are is one year.

3971
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:02,170
The second time is three years and the
third time is five minimum with three

3972
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:07,171
strokes of the cane says 10 consumption
just means that your urine has tested

3973
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,544
positive.

3974
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:12,970
We'd be heading to this Lillehammer
I ain't trying to go there dude.

3975
01:41:12,971 --> 01:41:14,660
I am not trying to go there.

3976
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,970
I would not pump for the flight.

3977
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:16,090
I've,

3978
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:18,850
I've never been on a long flight and I
was not plump for that and I was pumped

3979
01:41:18,851 --> 01:41:20,320
to go and check it out and
they've been out of the country.

3980
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:21,820
But here's a weird one with that.

3981
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:24,040
Like how many weeks out
are we talking about?

3982
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:25,270
Like consumption.

3983
01:41:25,271 --> 01:41:26,710
You mean if you test anything?

3984
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:27,370
Yeah,

3985
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:31,390
the article says that there's a lot of
Singaporeans that try to take drug trips

3986
01:41:31,420 --> 01:41:35,620
and they get caught when they come back
cause it's still in their system for

3987
01:41:35,621 --> 01:41:36,454
guys.

3988
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:37,563
50 people,

3989
01:41:38,170 --> 01:41:39,850
50 people year to year,

3990
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:41,470
a year in jail for drugs,

3991
01:41:41,860 --> 01:41:42,431
ecstasy,

3992
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:43,690
anything sweet.

3993
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,131
Oh my God,

3994
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:46,090
that's terrifying.

3995
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,240
Scary.

3996
01:41:47,240 --> 01:41:48,370
That's what we're dealing with.

3997
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:50,170
I mean this is human beings.

3998
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:55,690
2018 so you can live like we live here
in California where weed is legal and if

3999
01:41:55,691 --> 01:41:56,680
you're a grown adult,

4000
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,910
just like you could buy a drink,

4001
01:41:57,911 --> 01:41:58,720
you could buy a joint,

4002
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,560
which it should be.

4003
01:41:59,561 --> 01:42:00,730
It should have been a long time ago.

4004
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:04,360
And then there's places where
they just put you in a cage.

4005
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,793
North Korea.

4006
01:42:05,890 --> 01:42:06,251
Yeah.

4007
01:42:06,251 --> 01:42:06,481
Dude.

4008
01:42:06,481 --> 01:42:08,490
That shit is insane about,

4009
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,970
cause they can't do they even,

4010
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,380
they don't even have like
smartphones dressed stuff.

4011
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:11,531
Right.

4012
01:42:11,531 --> 01:42:13,600
They don't have internet or
don't know what they have.

4013
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:18,601
I think it should have some sort of a
small internet that only uses like North

4014
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,930
Korea channels and shit like that.

4015
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,940
I don't think they get
the regular internet.

4016
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:24,491
Yeah,

4017
01:42:24,491 --> 01:42:24,761
dude,

4018
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:27,100
they're living today under
the grip of a dictator.

4019
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:29,830
It's so easy for us to bitch
about random stuff being here,

4020
01:42:29,831 --> 01:42:30,970
but we're so lucky.

4021
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:31,640
Yeah.

4022
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:36,160
Well how about the fact that the Korean
guy runs it is friends with Dennis

4023
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:36,190
Rodman?

4024
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:36,461
I know.

4025
01:42:36,461 --> 01:42:37,270
I was.

4026
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,160
I was talking to my little brother
on about that the other day.

4027
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:41,170
I was like really serious man.

4028
01:42:41,171 --> 01:42:42,370
He's friends with Dennis Rodman.

4029
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:43,510
Like what the hell?

4030
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:47,560
How fucking Dennis Dennis texted
real quick to see if he texted back.

4031
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:49,510
That is fucking crazy.

4032
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,610
That is fucking dentist's
parties with that dude.

4033
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:53,290
Barney's like,

4034
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:54,430
have you been to North Korea?

4035
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:55,323
Oh yeah.

4036
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:56,740
I think more than once.

4037
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:57,910
Is that,

4038
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:58,600
do they make,

4039
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,231
what was that movie?

4040
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:03,190
They make fun of North Korea dinner
with Dennis Rodman in that too.

4041
01:43:03,191 --> 01:43:03,900
Or No.

4042
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:04,733
Oh,

4043
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:05,660
that move money.

4044
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:07,210
It seems like a big risk.

4045
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,421
No,

4046
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:07,721
I know.

4047
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:08,710
I was thinking that too.

4048
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:09,011
Yeah,

4049
01:43:09,011 --> 01:43:10,540
we probably shouldn't
talk about that movie.

4050
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:14,290
Aren't they all have
in a meeting here soon?

4051
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,680
Donald and the Korean
leaders to meet in Singapore?

4052
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:18,210
Yeah.

4053
01:43:18,210 --> 01:43:20,110
That's what people were talking about.

4054
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,450
The how dangerous it was to me.

4055
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:23,120
To Singapore.

4056
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:23,340
Dennis.

4057
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:23,551
Rob,

4058
01:43:23,551 --> 01:43:23,760
no.

4059
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,280
Be in Singapore during
Trump king summit sugar.

4060
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:28,150
We got to get it on that.

4061
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:31,180
Most of the are going to Singapore.

4062
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:34,240
See there's some people that were
saying they shouldn't do it in Singapore

4063
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:37,180
because Singapore is such a
horrible human rights record,

4064
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,850
so some shit could be going down.

4065
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:40,001
Yeah.

4066
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:44,100
I don't see if Singapore really does
lock you up like that just for pot like

4067
01:43:44,101 --> 01:43:44,934
that is.

4068
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:47,320
That is something that you want
to have a meeting with like,

4069
01:43:47,590 --> 01:43:49,120
but that doesn't make any sense.

4070
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:51,410
Like that's an illogical
at the government.

4071
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:52,160
These

4072
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,760
people running under the grip of their,

4073
01:43:54,761 --> 01:43:56,960
they're living there.

4074
01:43:56,980 --> 01:43:58,730
There's less afraid of lies.

4075
01:43:59,120 --> 01:43:59,451
Right.

4076
01:43:59,451 --> 01:43:59,900
Like there are,

4077
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,490
what are they afraid
of with this marijuana?

4078
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:03,350
What do they think it's going to do?

4079
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:03,621
What do you,

4080
01:44:03,621 --> 01:44:03,951
what do they,

4081
01:44:03,951 --> 01:44:04,731
what are they afraid of?

4082
01:44:04,731 --> 01:44:08,330
What people taking drugs open people's
mind like a little bit fact that they

4083
01:44:08,331 --> 01:44:08,931
think did they,

4084
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:13,490
and they've made it so that they can
just lock you up in a cage if you do

4085
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:16,100
something with your body that
they don't want you to do.

4086
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,153
Look at him while,

4087
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,890
because they've decided that this is some
sort of a bizarre form of dictatorship

4088
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:23,090
that they can get away with.

4089
01:44:24,050 --> 01:44:24,621
Seriously.

4090
01:44:24,621 --> 01:44:25,401
Fuck man.

4091
01:44:25,401 --> 01:44:29,780
That is nuts that that's happening
while we're living here this way.

4092
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:31,580
Trump,

4093
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:35,090
Kim Singapore summit venue is set.

4094
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,400
Trump who had a mommy,

4095
01:44:37,401 --> 01:44:38,234
the president,

4096
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:42,740
who would want to be the president when
you're already a billionaire to imagine

4097
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:45,290
the sit in on that fuck my life.

4098
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:46,120
Didn't know.

4099
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:50,690
The crazy thing is this dude has always
been this way and everybody's shocked

4100
01:44:50,691 --> 01:44:52,760
that he's this way now
that he's the president.

4101
01:44:52,780 --> 01:44:53,613
Right?

4102
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:55,670
And it's not just that they're shocked.

4103
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:56,151
It's just like,

4104
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:57,080
it is shocking.

4105
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:59,630
Like this Philadelphia Eagles thing,

4106
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,340
like not enough of them wanted
to come to the White House.

4107
01:45:02,341 --> 01:45:03,440
So he canceled the meeting.

4108
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:04,363
And so the thing,

4109
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:06,650
they didn't kneel for the national anthem.

4110
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,170
And so then if they find out that no,

4111
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:10,040
those fucking guys,

4112
01:45:10,041 --> 01:45:10,730
none of them,

4113
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:12,260
none of them kneeled
for the national anthem,

4114
01:45:12,261 --> 01:45:13,094
they all stood.

4115
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:15,441
So he wrote,

4116
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:18,040
he's trumps had something along
the lines of I fucked it up.

4117
01:45:18,090 --> 01:45:20,690
He said something along the
lines of that they didn't,

4118
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,090
some of them didn't stand
for the national anthem,

4119
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:25,070
but it turns out was only
one guy that kneeled.

4120
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:27,830
And the one guy that Neil was cut before,

4121
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,271
uh,

4122
01:45:28,271 --> 01:45:29,450
the regular season.

4123
01:45:29,630 --> 01:45:31,250
So during the regular season,

4124
01:45:31,251 --> 01:45:32,780
everybody was standing
for the national anthem.

4125
01:45:32,781 --> 01:45:33,471
So he said something,

4126
01:45:33,471 --> 01:45:34,400
it wasn't even true.

4127
01:45:34,970 --> 01:45:37,190
I just didn't want a small crowd of dudes.

4128
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,960
He didn't want like three
dudes elec second stringers,

4129
01:45:40,330 --> 01:45:41,163
dawn old.

4130
01:45:41,870 --> 01:45:42,703
Looking forward,

4131
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:46,850
you can tell her all high cause
they're melded all dry now.

4132
01:45:46,851 --> 01:45:47,684
Right.

4133
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:49,580
So I'm the Philly,

4134
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:51,230
the mayor of Philadelphia,

4135
01:45:51,231 --> 01:45:53,240
or is the governor of Pennsylvania,

4136
01:45:53,241 --> 01:45:53,811
which one was,

4137
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:55,130
it was the mayor of Philadelphia.

4138
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:59,540
Somebody went after him and he said what
a fragile ego he has that he couldn't

4139
01:45:59,541 --> 01:46:01,010
deal with not having a party.

4140
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,340
We're enough Pete having a party
that people didn't want to go to.

4141
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,800
It's just that that's,

4142
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,980
that kind of shit is like part of him.

4143
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:10,940
The show man,

4144
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:13,160
like that's the act
that Trump the show man.

4145
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:15,200
He's been involved in his whole life.

4146
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:15,471
Right.

4147
01:46:15,471 --> 01:46:19,730
It's like everything he does is the best
and pumping everything up and we expect

4148
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:22,790
differently now that he's the
president and that's where it's,

4149
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:25,100
it's also strange because
this is just kind of,

4150
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:28,490
people were really angry at it because
he's doing it as the president,

4151
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:30,620
but this is like what he's always done.

4152
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,390
He's like a branding genius.

4153
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,530
Any,

4154
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:36,680
it's weird because we're seeing
it as a president or likethis.

4155
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:37,820
Is that what you're supposed to do?

4156
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:40,190
You're not supposed to like
bend the truth as the president,

4157
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,770
but like that bending of the truth in his,

4158
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:44,660
in his eyes is always how he lived.

4159
01:46:44,661 --> 01:46:45,980
He was the Trump guy.

4160
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:48,320
He's the fucking guy
who ran the apprentice.

4161
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:49,930
Now he runs the country.

4162
01:46:49,931 --> 01:46:50,520
It's insane.

4163
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,760
Fucking never followed politics
ever and I had no idea about,

4164
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:56,850
I bet Paul P in any way thought
it was going to be like this.

4165
01:46:56,851 --> 01:46:58,050
Who had never signed up for it.

4166
01:46:58,500 --> 01:46:59,280
That's what I think.

4167
01:46:59,280 --> 01:46:59,730
So,

4168
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:00,241
yeah,

4169
01:47:00,241 --> 01:47:00,691
man.

4170
01:47:00,691 --> 01:47:01,530
Not going the way you think.

4171
01:47:01,531 --> 01:47:03,180
Don't you think he would
bitch about it though?

4172
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:04,890
Like bitch about it.

4173
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:06,180
But that's part of his thing,

4174
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:06,900
man.

4175
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:10,800
The crazy thing is there was no one
on the republican side that was,

4176
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,200
that was capable of challenging him.

4177
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:14,580
That's the problem.

4178
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:16,960
The problem was that
they didn't have anybody.

4179
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:19,860
So there's all of a sudden this
guy's in there and I was in there.

4180
01:47:19,861 --> 01:47:22,440
He's probably thinking he's
going to lose and then you know,

4181
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:23,101
he likes to win.

4182
01:47:23,101 --> 01:47:23,910
It's shit.

4183
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:24,301
She's like,

4184
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:24,511
God,

4185
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:24,691
yeah,

4186
01:47:24,691 --> 01:47:25,051
fuck it.

4187
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:26,060
I'm just going to be president.

4188
01:47:26,250 --> 01:47:27,180
And the next thing you know,

4189
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:28,140
he is the president.

4190
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,060
Nobody still the same guy,

4191
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:30,331
man.

4192
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:31,800
He's still the guy from the apprentice.

4193
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,900
That's not his fault.

4194
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,180
It's who he is.

4195
01:47:36,630 --> 01:47:38,400
To ask a guy to change that much.

4196
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:39,660
It's 70 it's crazy.

4197
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:44,661
I think the best thing about it is it
highlights how ridiculous this whole

4198
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:50,361
process is and the idea of having
one person run 300 million people,

4199
01:47:51,481 --> 01:47:52,770
that's insane.

4200
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:54,180
And you pick that person,

4201
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:54,700
it's insane.

4202
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:56,100
And we don't even know what we're doing.

4203
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,150
Are we even picking?

4204
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,840
No.

4205
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:57,991
Well,

4206
01:47:57,991 --> 01:47:58,980
we don't even know what we're doing.

4207
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:03,210
How much of what we pay and how much of
like what the bills are about and all

4208
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:03,871
these amendments.

4209
01:48:03,871 --> 01:48:04,200
I'm I,

4210
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:07,920
how much of any of that shit do you pay
attention to when Congress is in session

4211
01:48:07,921 --> 01:48:09,150
at the Senate rules on things,

4212
01:48:09,151 --> 01:48:10,560
how much do we pay attention?

4213
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,000
How much does everybody pay attention?

4214
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:15,930
How much do you even know what
someone's actual real policies are?

4215
01:48:15,931 --> 01:48:17,310
At least their stated policies.

4216
01:48:17,311 --> 01:48:18,180
When you're voting for him,

4217
01:48:18,420 --> 01:48:20,070
what is it like 10% people?

4218
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:21,143
Seriously.

4219
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:21,751
You know,

4220
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:23,970
like you hear who you're
supposed to vote for know,

4221
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:26,970
vote for Hillary Clinton is
Donald Trump's a bad person,

4222
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:27,870
you know,

4223
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:29,100
vote for Hillary Clinton.

4224
01:48:29,130 --> 01:48:30,710
She's the most qualified for the job.

4225
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:30,961
You're like,

4226
01:48:30,961 --> 01:48:31,261
okay,

4227
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:31,531
yeah,

4228
01:48:31,531 --> 01:48:32,364
that sounds about right.

4229
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:33,031
And people are like,

4230
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:34,440
you are voting for Hillary Clinton,

4231
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:34,921
aren't you?

4232
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:36,390
She's the most qualified for the job.

4233
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:36,601
You're like,

4234
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:37,021
okay,

4235
01:48:37,021 --> 01:48:37,854
yeah,

4236
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:38,990
I want to be a good person.

4237
01:48:39,100 --> 01:48:40,290
Some of the vote for Hillary.

4238
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:41,400
What about Jill Stein?

4239
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:42,750
You know Jill Stein's a woman to,

4240
01:48:42,751 --> 01:48:43,950
you know Jill Stein is brilliant.

4241
01:48:43,951 --> 01:48:45,720
You know Joel Stein's Okay Shit,

4242
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:46,740
I'm going to go progressive,

4243
01:48:46,741 --> 01:48:47,231
but her stand,

4244
01:48:47,231 --> 01:48:48,064
I told Jill Stein

4245
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:53,430
and then there was Elizabeth Warren
might've lied about being part of American

4246
01:48:53,431 --> 01:48:54,030
Indian.

4247
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:54,863
That was a problem.

4248
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:55,930
So it was like,

4249
01:48:55,930 --> 01:49:00,900
like who who's going to go is Bernie
Sanders and then all that shit to him and

4250
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:03,810
Hillary Clinton is that the
whole story is so bizarre.

4251
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,460
Like watching it all play out on TV.

4252
01:49:05,461 --> 01:49:06,510
It's so strange.

4253
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:08,230
It's so strange that this is our,

4254
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:11,640
our form of government
like you would think with,

4255
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:12,810
this is my thought.

4256
01:49:13,110 --> 01:49:17,190
You would think with the kind
of things that the organism,

4257
01:49:17,191 --> 01:49:18,060
that is a human being,

4258
01:49:18,061 --> 01:49:23,061
the kind of thing that could figure out
a way to make sound go through a metal

4259
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:28,101
thing covered in foam goes through wires
and in real time hits people in their

4260
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:31,200
ears.

4261
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,370
If they're streaming,

4262
01:49:32,430 --> 01:49:35,820
they could have headphones on beyond
the train right now and they're getting

4263
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:40,821
this in real time that we can send
video through the sky and it can hit

4264
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,330
Australia.

4265
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:46,560
Your friends can text you pictures
back and forth from Africa.

4266
01:49:46,561 --> 01:49:48,070
They could be in Africa and

4267
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,431
dude,

4268
01:49:48,431 --> 01:49:51,160
I just saw a leopard and they send
you a fucking photo and you're like,

4269
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:52,000
Holy Shit,

4270
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:53,800
that's flying through the sky.

4271
01:49:54,190 --> 01:49:59,190
And yet the best way we can figure out
who's in control of the nuclear weapons

4272
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:01,300
is to have a popularity contest.

4273
01:50:02,150 --> 01:50:04,690
No word for crazy.

4274
01:50:04,691 --> 01:50:06,070
Where the craziest thing,

4275
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:06,421
God,

4276
01:50:06,421 --> 01:50:06,940
it's not,

4277
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:07,540
we're like,

4278
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:12,190
we're in like this wave of like being
evolved and not being involved at the same

4279
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:12,371
time,

4280
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:17,371
like technologically spectacularly evolved
to the point where we can bend matter

4281
01:50:17,681 --> 01:50:22,681
and create nuclear weapons and fly robots
to Mars and take pictures and send it

4282
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:23,800
back to us.

4283
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:28,540
Like the shit that we can do is off the
charts when it comes to like technology

4284
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:32,410
and our ability to manipulate the world
around us and create giant buildings and

4285
01:50:32,411 --> 01:50:35,350
structures and airplanes
and bridges and shit.

4286
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:36,100
But the,

4287
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:39,190
the monkey interaction thing
is still not very good.

4288
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:40,690
So we still have war.

4289
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:45,130
We still have places where we send
people over with metal tanks and guns and

4290
01:50:45,131 --> 01:50:48,250
shoot people and protect people from the
other people that are shooting people

4291
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:52,690
and get involved in all these fucking
crazy things are physical interactions as

4292
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:57,190
as organisms are just still
in this barbaric stage.

4293
01:50:57,370 --> 01:51:02,140
We're still in this one tribe going after
another tribe stage from 20,000 years

4294
01:51:02,141 --> 01:51:02,381
ago,

4295
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:03,580
30,000 years ago.

4296
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,260
It's like the same programming,

4297
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:09,970
but now this programming can fly jets
filled with missiles and shoot them out of

4298
01:51:09,971 --> 01:51:13,480
the sky and sneak up on you
underwater in a metal tube,

4299
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:18,640
a summary and it shoots fucking nuclear
with missiles and shit underwater.

4300
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:19,420
I mean,

4301
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:21,490
we're in the weirdest flux.

4302
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:26,491
We're in this weird sort of unbalanced
period in the evolution of the human

4303
01:51:27,161 --> 01:51:31,150
organism cause we can do so much
and then put Donald's in charge,

4304
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,910
man about fucking everything.

4305
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:37,900
We're mad about men who decide they're
women who want to use the girls' room.

4306
01:51:38,110 --> 01:51:39,520
We're mad about everything.

4307
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:39,881
We're about,

4308
01:51:39,881 --> 01:51:41,020
about religion.

4309
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:44,590
We're mad about rights
and gender and everything.

4310
01:51:44,680 --> 01:51:45,341
Everything.

4311
01:51:45,341 --> 01:51:45,791
We're mad,

4312
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:46,660
everyone's mad.

4313
01:51:46,661 --> 01:51:47,710
Fuck rose have bar.

4314
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:48,580
Everyone's mad.

4315
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,230
Everyone is so mad.

4316
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:55,480
And while all this is all this weird
personal interaction shit is happening,

4317
01:51:55,630 --> 01:51:57,190
that's distracting the fuck out of us.

4318
01:51:57,191 --> 01:51:59,140
The more it ramps up the,

4319
01:51:59,220 --> 01:51:59,831
the better.

4320
01:51:59,831 --> 01:52:04,831
Ai gets our foot artificial intelligence
because it gets just keep working on it

4321
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,030
and keep getting better and better.

4322
01:52:07,031 --> 01:52:11,410
We're going to be in like a full
on rock fight when AI goes live,

4323
01:52:11,411 --> 01:52:12,100
it's like,

4324
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:12,933
it's like we're,

4325
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:16,270
we're falling into this whole
like if this was a trap,

4326
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:19,450
if I was artificial intelligence
and I knew how to be like,

4327
01:52:19,451 --> 01:52:21,010
well as what we'll do,

4328
01:52:21,011 --> 01:52:23,890
we'll just go back in time and set
people up and make them make us,

4329
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:29,340
we'll just plant this idea in their heads
and just like an aquatic worm makes a

4330
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:33,340
caterpillar or one of those grasshoppers
rather jump into a pool and drowned

4331
01:52:33,341 --> 01:52:35,380
itself so that it could
swim out of its brain.

4332
01:52:35,410 --> 01:52:37,570
You ever seen one of those
things happen just like that?

4333
01:52:37,571 --> 01:52:38,860
Ai's doing that with us.

4334
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:44,070
They give us Shiny Samsung Galaxy note
nine look at how big the whole pottery is

4335
01:52:44,920 --> 01:52:47,780
and he takes photos of your
face and knows your face.

4336
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:48,990
You can tell your face.

4337
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:49,370
Yeah.

4338
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:51,470
Face ID and fingerprints.

4339
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:52,680
And before you know it,

4340
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:53,871
listen,

4341
01:52:53,871 --> 01:52:57,350
we've found the best way to get a
signal to talk to people doing that.

4342
01:52:57,680 --> 01:52:58,760
You just stick it in your ass.

4343
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,020
It's a little pellet.

4344
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:02,510
We're gonna put a little
robot Dick in our ass,

4345
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:03,420
a little pepper.

4346
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:04,071
The appellate.

4347
01:53:04,071 --> 01:53:05,210
If you could just hold in your ass,

4348
01:53:05,211 --> 01:53:05,781
it's smooth.

4349
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:06,950
Do you barely know what's in there?

4350
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,000
But it connects with your,

4351
01:53:09,001 --> 01:53:10,070
your ass is open.

4352
01:53:10,071 --> 01:53:12,890
It's not like the rest of your skin
and y'all got to keep it in your mouth,

4353
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:13,400
right?

4354
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:13,521
Well,

4355
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:15,290
to asses the way to go
cause it's like open.

4356
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:15,650
You know,

4357
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:19,390
it's not like you don't have to go
through the dermis and so that just just

4358
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:22,880
connects with you and you can
fucking see augmented reality.

4359
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:24,260
But the little tiny robot dick,

4360
01:53:24,261 --> 01:53:25,094
it's about that big.

4361
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:26,240
You barely feel it.

4362
01:53:26,241 --> 01:53:27,074
It's like a BB.

4363
01:53:27,250 --> 01:53:28,083
Uh,

4364
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:29,570
that's what's going to happen,

4365
01:53:29,571 --> 01:53:29,960
dude,

4366
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:30,590
fucking prior.

4367
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:31,090
Right?

4368
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:34,880
Do these things are growing
now our anti-aging shit too.

4369
01:53:34,881 --> 01:53:36,500
Who knows how crazy that's going to get.

4370
01:53:36,830 --> 01:53:38,300
I think what the weirdest thing is,

4371
01:53:38,301 --> 01:53:39,230
not the anti aging.

4372
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:41,390
I think we're going to run
into biological limitations.

4373
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:43,070
I think the weirdest shit is gene editing.

4374
01:53:44,330 --> 01:53:45,570
Fuck yeah,

4375
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:46,461
let's just solve this.

4376
01:53:46,461 --> 01:53:48,020
Took a turn for the stoner

4377
01:53:50,140 --> 01:53:51,620
gene editing scares the shit out of me.

4378
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,000
Was that unexplained on the,

4379
01:53:54,001 --> 01:53:55,020
explain that new necklace,

4380
01:53:55,100 --> 01:53:55,731
Netflix show,

4381
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:56,880
gene editing and how,

4382
01:53:56,881 --> 01:53:57,121
how,

4383
01:53:57,121 --> 01:53:57,830
how did he,

4384
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,330
that Shit's going to get wild,

4385
01:53:59,331 --> 01:54:00,164
wild country.

4386
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:01,400
I only watched the first episode,

4387
01:54:01,401 --> 01:54:01,791
but I was like,

4388
01:54:01,791 --> 01:54:02,960
Holy Shit,

4389
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,300
I see where this is going
to follow show baby.

4390
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:08,570
Fuck everyone.

4391
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,520
The man.

4392
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:12,630
As far as that out,

4393
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:13,660
and I'm like,

4394
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:15,530
it takes a turn,

4395
01:54:15,531 --> 01:54:18,320
but I'm sure he still had good intentions.

4396
01:54:18,321 --> 01:54:20,000
I think trying to build the community,

4397
01:54:20,001 --> 01:54:21,200
I'm just passionate and this is,

4398
01:54:21,201 --> 01:54:21,561
again,

4399
01:54:21,561 --> 01:54:22,394
this is the thing,

4400
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:26,780
it's the fucking human interaction part
is the part that we can't get right.

4401
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:28,100
It's real weird.

4402
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:31,970
If you look at all the different kinds
of interactions that we managed to

4403
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:35,810
successfully navigate and people have
obviously have problems in business and

4404
01:54:35,811 --> 01:54:39,080
there's lawsuits in business and there's
people that get fired and there's all

4405
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:40,970
sorts of problems with
people doing business.

4406
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:44,480
But overall they get a
lot of things done right?

4407
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:46,250
Like business keeps improving.

4408
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:47,300
Things keep getting better.

4409
01:54:47,510 --> 01:54:50,300
We barely improved with
how we treat each other,

4410
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:52,760
like the way human
beings treat each other.

4411
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:57,410
We barely get better at that and
we do react to things better.

4412
01:54:57,830 --> 01:55:00,020
Like if we're mad at
someone for doing something,

4413
01:55:00,110 --> 01:55:05,110
that's where we would like more clear
with like agregious violations of our

4414
01:55:05,811 --> 01:55:06,291
code.

4415
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:06,471
Right?

4416
01:55:06,471 --> 01:55:07,304
Like racism.

4417
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:08,960
Like this Roseanne thing was a big one,

4418
01:55:08,961 --> 01:55:09,740
right?

4419
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:10,341
Everybody was like,

4420
01:55:10,341 --> 01:55:11,420
no fucking way.

4421
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,710
We're not tolerating that.

4422
01:55:12,711 --> 01:55:13,544
Fuck her.

4423
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:15,170
And the ABC's like Yo fuck it.

4424
01:55:15,171 --> 01:55:16,160
We're pulling the plug on the show.

4425
01:55:16,161 --> 01:55:16,381
It's like,

4426
01:55:16,381 --> 01:55:17,930
like immediate reactions.

4427
01:55:18,340 --> 01:55:19,480
So it's like what I,

4428
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:20,400
what I'm co,

4429
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:21,740
I don't think it was right.

4430
01:55:21,741 --> 01:55:25,820
I think she's got a lot of problems and
she's taken a shit load of pills and

4431
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:28,070
she's all fucked up and
I know she's not racist.

4432
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:29,390
At least she tells me that.

4433
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,190
But what I do know is that racism is
horrible and people just don't want to

4434
01:55:34,191 --> 01:55:35,210
tolerate it anymore.

4435
01:55:35,211 --> 01:55:36,350
And that's what the good thing is.

4436
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:37,101
The good thing is like this,

4437
01:55:37,101 --> 01:55:37,490
right?

4438
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:42,490
There's overwhelming response from
people that they're not tolerating racism

4439
01:55:43,140 --> 01:55:43,500
anymore.

4440
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:43,980
You can't

4441
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:44,880
do that anymore.

4442
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:46,650
We won't tolerate it.

4443
01:55:47,130 --> 01:55:49,650
And this is fairly new man.

4444
01:55:50,160 --> 01:55:53,190
I mean w with the civil rights marches,

4445
01:55:53,191 --> 01:55:54,600
that was in the 60s right?

4446
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:58,080
I mean think about what was going on
in the 50s and the forties and fed that

4447
01:55:58,081 --> 01:55:58,830
shit.

4448
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:02,040
That was not that long ago in terms
of like how long there's been people.

4449
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:05,820
So we're dealing with this
radical change in this regard,

4450
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:10,950
but very little change in like
our kindness to each other.

4451
01:56:11,930 --> 01:56:16,920
That's why did start the American
mushroom day or not the American,

4452
01:56:16,921 --> 01:56:21,180
the worldwide are you should fear has
a holiday that he created called true

4453
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:22,014
fest.

4454
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:22,521
Yeah.

4455
01:56:22,521 --> 01:56:23,790
It's several days are,

4456
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:24,663
doesn't fuck around.

4457
01:56:25,660 --> 01:56:28,770
Got a real job since he was the
doorman at the comedy store.

4458
01:56:29,430 --> 01:56:30,960
He operates on its own schedule.

4459
01:56:31,470 --> 01:56:31,950
That's,

4460
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:36,150
that's what it's going to take for
something like that worldwide to change.

4461
01:56:36,151 --> 01:56:39,510
It'll certainly help cause shrimp fest
festival certainly out she's room to

4462
01:56:39,511 --> 01:56:40,300
help.

4463
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:41,190
I'm promoting that,

4464
01:56:42,690 --> 01:56:44,130
but I feel like I'm,

4465
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:45,810
part of it is because we're scared.

4466
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,460
I legitimately feel like we're scared.

4467
01:56:47,461 --> 01:56:49,710
And I think when someone
like Trump is in office,

4468
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:53,410
we're more scared because we
realize how easy it is for,

4469
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:54,263
uh,

4470
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:54,871
you know,

4471
01:56:54,871 --> 01:56:57,900
I hate to use a term regular person cause
he's definitely not a regular person.

4472
01:56:57,901 --> 01:57:00,930
He's very successful and very famous
and everybody knew who he was,

4473
01:57:00,931 --> 01:57:03,120
but regular person turns that we don't,

4474
01:57:03,480 --> 01:57:06,060
that's not how it
politician acts like that.

4475
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:07,980
This is like some crazy show man.

4476
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:11,190
And when a crazy show man
becomes the leader of the thing,

4477
01:57:11,191 --> 01:57:12,360
whether or not he's doing good is,

4478
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:15,750
I'm not even arguing politically whether
he's doing good or bad or the economy's

4479
01:57:15,751 --> 01:57:16,680
up because of him,

4480
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:17,753
I don't know.

4481
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,650
But it's just how he behaves.

4482
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:23,140
It's who he is like that
that freaks people out.

4483
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:26,880
And that makes people more on edge
and so they're more angry and they're,

4484
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:27,091
they're,

4485
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:27,350
they're,

4486
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:31,020
they're more looking to call people out
on things and they're more looking to

4487
01:57:31,021 --> 01:57:32,100
stomp out racism.

4488
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:32,993
I get it.

4489
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:36,660
And making other people would think if
someone like Sam Harris was a precedent

4490
01:57:36,661 --> 01:57:38,940
or something and he was talking
about a national mushroom day,

4491
01:57:38,941 --> 01:57:40,050
are talking about that stuff,

4492
01:57:40,051 --> 01:57:41,580
how bad people would freak out.

4493
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:42,930
Seriously,

4494
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:43,830
they would freak.

4495
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,020
Or are they just people
that disagree with Sam too?

4496
01:57:46,021 --> 01:57:46,201
You know,

4497
01:57:46,201 --> 01:57:47,400
there's a ton of re very,

4498
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:49,260
very smart people that disagree with Sam.

4499
01:57:50,100 --> 01:57:50,431
You know,

4500
01:57:50,431 --> 01:57:53,820
and it's really interesting to see those
disagreements cause when really high

4501
01:57:53,821 --> 01:57:58,821
level intellects debate each other about
things or disagree on things and you

4502
01:57:58,921 --> 01:58:03,921
get to see not just their ideas play
out and how their ideas work against the

4503
01:58:05,791 --> 01:58:06,780
other person's ideas.

4504
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:07,860
You get to see that.

4505
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:13,490
But you also get to see like thinking and,

4506
01:58:14,181 --> 01:58:14,461
and,

4507
01:58:14,461 --> 01:58:14,731
and,

4508
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:17,760
and communicating at a super high level,

4509
01:58:17,970 --> 01:58:18,241
right?

4510
01:58:18,241 --> 01:58:22,560
They're intellectuals are
trying to outsmart each other
so that they're debating

4511
01:58:22,561 --> 01:58:26,610
about the existence of God
or whatever the fuck it is.

4512
01:58:26,611 --> 01:58:29,100
When you get really smart
people who disagree on Shit.

4513
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,930
Very fascinating.

4514
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:32,730
It's like one of the more
interesting things to watch.

4515
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:34,410
So like a lot of ways,

4516
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:35,640
high level Jujitsu,

4517
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:36,570
you know,

4518
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,820
and a lot of ways you're watching like Oh,

4519
01:58:38,821 --> 01:58:39,330
okay.

4520
01:58:39,330 --> 01:58:39,931
And those guys,

4521
01:58:39,931 --> 01:58:42,340
a lot of them get into
g like is in a Jujitsu,

4522
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:42,900
is he?

4523
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:43,330
Yeah.

4524
01:58:43,330 --> 01:58:45,040
I think that's one of the
reasons why he's into it.

4525
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:46,900
It's cause he's kind of
doing Jujitsu when he's,

4526
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,250
when he's doing these debates.

4527
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:48,870
Yeah.

4528
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:49,700
Damn man,

4529
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:52,180
I want my little brother
to do it so bad he won't,

4530
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:53,373
won't try it.

4531
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:53,991
Wow.

4532
01:58:53,991 --> 01:58:54,970
It's probably hard.

4533
01:58:54,970 --> 01:58:58,060
His brothers of fucking
MMA star and he's like,

4534
01:58:58,061 --> 01:58:58,360
yeah,

4535
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:58,631
I know,

4536
01:58:58,631 --> 01:58:59,780
but alone shit bro.

4537
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,600
He could,

4538
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,560
it could be as passionate.

4539
01:59:02,561 --> 01:59:03,760
They get me to have a
passionate and I'm like,

4540
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:03,941
dude,

4541
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:07,510
you could try to get through and you
know the people first smart people.

4542
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:09,260
I think it's the support.

4543
01:59:09,340 --> 01:59:09,611
I'm like,

4544
01:59:09,611 --> 01:59:09,791
dude,

4545
01:59:09,791 --> 01:59:12,670
you could be so good
at Jujitsu and love it.

4546
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:13,750
It is very smart.

4547
01:59:13,751 --> 01:59:15,100
There's a lot of super smart.

4548
01:59:15,101 --> 01:59:16,870
Eddie always calls him his nerd assassins.

4549
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:20,000
Super Smart dudes that are
really good at Jujitsu.

4550
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:20,471
Scary.

4551
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:20,740
Good.

4552
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,080
I think like getting a black
belt from someone goods,

4553
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:26,770
one of the hardest degrees out there
to get in any college or anything

4554
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:28,451
physically.

4555
01:59:28,451 --> 01:59:33,451
The thing about college is if you put
in the work and you're smart enough,

4556
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:34,960
it's possible.

4557
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:35,141
I mean,

4558
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:35,974
you can do it.

4559
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,640
I mean,

4560
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,080
it's a possible achievement.

4561
01:59:38,081 --> 01:59:39,400
A lot of people have done it.

4562
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,230
A lot of people do it every year,

4563
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,030
but to really get a black belt bull,

4564
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:47,260
you gotta get,

4565
01:59:47,260 --> 01:59:48,190
you gotta get better.

4566
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:49,000
Like you got it.

4567
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:49,721
You have to get back,

4568
01:59:49,721 --> 01:59:50,680
you gotta get strong,

4569
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,330
you're going to get choked a lot.

4570
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:55,990
And how were you built or you
built normal like a small,

4571
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:56,831
if you're small,

4572
01:59:56,831 --> 01:59:58,090
you're extra super fucked.

4573
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:58,750
Right?

4574
01:59:58,750 --> 01:59:59,530
How's your ego?

4575
01:59:59,530 --> 01:59:59,681
Yeah.

4576
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:00,400
How's your ego?

4577
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,600
Can you learn?

4578
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:03,280
Do you know how to tap?

4579
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:04,150
Because if you don't tap,

4580
02:00:04,151 --> 02:00:04,984
you're going to get hurt.

4581
02:00:05,310 --> 02:00:10,120
Like almost every significant
injury I ever got doing Jujitsu,

4582
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:12,730
other than like one fucked up knee was,

4583
02:00:12,731 --> 02:00:15,070
which was just a weird
passing the guard thing.

4584
02:00:15,071 --> 02:00:15,260
My,

4585
02:00:15,260 --> 02:00:16,330
my ACL popped.

4586
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,030
But almost every other one
was from not happening.

4587
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:20,043
Yeah,

4588
02:00:20,140 --> 02:00:22,630
just just decide you're not going to tap.

4589
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,800
I'm going to try to get out of this.

4590
02:00:23,801 --> 02:00:24,190
I'm gonna try it.

4591
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:27,030
And someone's got unit Doris or something
like that and your shit's all fucking

4592
02:00:27,031 --> 02:00:29,380
cracked over and then for the next week,

4593
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,720
ah,

4594
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:33,460
you get that tightness in
the middle of your back.

4595
02:00:33,680 --> 02:00:35,020
Like why didn't I just tap?

4596
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:35,980
I should have just tapped.

4597
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,150
John Crouch always told me,

4598
02:00:37,151 --> 02:00:37,391
he's like,

4599
02:00:37,391 --> 02:00:37,631
dude,

4600
02:00:37,631 --> 02:00:39,490
you're just so tough
when you get submissions.

4601
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:40,510
People can't tap you out,

4602
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:42,700
but I want you to just
focus on not getting there.

4603
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:43,331
So when you get there,

4604
02:00:43,331 --> 02:00:44,170
just tap right away.

4605
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:45,880
Just focus on not getting there.

4606
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,470
It's very smart because you know what,

4607
02:00:47,471 --> 02:00:48,760
you're always going to be tough.

4608
02:00:49,240 --> 02:00:50,470
And there's a certain,

4609
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:53,050
I mean you need to know a certain
amount of high level defense.

4610
02:00:53,051 --> 02:00:53,884
Like how can you,

4611
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:57,310
how long can you survive in a certain
spot if you actually have to survive.

4612
02:00:57,520 --> 02:00:59,140
But in training you're
not really surviving.

4613
02:00:59,141 --> 02:00:59,351
Right?

4614
02:00:59,351 --> 02:00:59,890
You're just,

4615
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:01,240
you should just tap sometimes.

4616
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:01,600
Oh yeah.

4617
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,680
Especially with Nishit
and arm shit and you know,

4618
02:01:05,681 --> 02:01:08,560
you pop something and then
it's fucked for six months.

4619
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:12,550
That's where we're going to be focused
on a lot with Sean is a lot of legs and

4620
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:14,050
heal hooks and the bars,

4621
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:18,280
the lower half of the body who you guys
are working with that on a Gusto Mendez

4622
02:01:18,281 --> 02:01:19,990
to Keanio yeah.

4623
02:01:20,230 --> 02:01:20,530
Yeah,

4624
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:21,640
super high level.

4625
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:22,121
It's fun.

4626
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:22,451
They hit,

4627
02:01:22,451 --> 02:01:23,550
they have competition roles.

4628
02:01:23,630 --> 02:01:25,200
It's like all the black belt,

4629
02:01:25,210 --> 02:01:26,110
like what are the six,

4630
02:01:26,111 --> 02:01:26,920
seven,

4631
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:27,221
six,

4632
02:01:27,221 --> 02:01:28,870
seven black belts and we
do a 10 minute rounds.

4633
02:01:28,871 --> 02:01:30,580
Usually Tim go back.

4634
02:01:30,990 --> 02:01:31,720
It's fun.

4635
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:36,720
That leg lock game is hitting an extremely
high level right now in Jiu Jitsu and

4636
02:01:36,941 --> 02:01:38,620
now trickling into MMA.

4637
02:01:38,621 --> 02:01:40,160
You know Dylan Dannis like

4638
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,940
the way he looked in Beltour I think
slowly in MMA it's going to be tough

4639
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,830
because a lot of spots you're getting
punched and then one punch solid punch in

4640
02:01:48,831 --> 02:01:50,390
the right spot changes their game.

4641
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:51,960
It puts a little fear in their mind.

4642
02:01:51,961 --> 02:01:53,210
So then for sure,

4643
02:01:53,211 --> 02:01:55,700
but if those guys can you
get good enough to strike,

4644
02:01:55,701 --> 02:01:56,481
to become a threat,

4645
02:01:56,481 --> 02:01:57,830
like a guy like Gary Tonin,

4646
02:01:57,860 --> 02:01:58,400
whoo.

4647
02:01:58,400 --> 02:01:59,233
That's scary.

4648
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:00,500
That's a scary dude.

4649
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:02,210
It really is very scary man.

4650
02:02:02,510 --> 02:02:03,680
Cause he gets a hold of that leg.

4651
02:02:03,681 --> 02:02:05,710
Urine [inaudible] bowls,

4652
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,580
sons and steps ahead.

4653
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:08,151
That Donna,

4654
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:09,250
her death squad man,

4655
02:02:09,260 --> 02:02:09,551
Donna,

4656
02:02:09,551 --> 02:02:11,000
hers are real wizard man.

4657
02:02:11,001 --> 02:02:12,840
So when we get him a hat with stars on it,

4658
02:02:14,010 --> 02:02:15,320
a little moons and stars,

4659
02:02:15,321 --> 02:02:19,790
he's a wizard zone who studied philosophy
like that and this is a type of person

4660
02:02:19,791 --> 02:02:20,271
like that.

4661
02:02:20,271 --> 02:02:21,440
It's fucking pretty cool.

4662
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:22,221
Yeah.

4663
02:02:22,221 --> 02:02:24,860
And that's shit that he wrote should
read that thing that he wrote about

4664
02:02:24,861 --> 02:02:25,340
routine.

4665
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:26,420
It's really interesting.

4666
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:28,490
It's a lot of really cool,

4667
02:02:28,491 --> 02:02:29,420
smart shit.

4668
02:02:29,540 --> 02:02:30,200
Check it out for sure.

4669
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,970
His Instagram was filled with cool,

4670
02:02:31,971 --> 02:02:32,804
smart shit.

4671
02:02:32,900 --> 02:02:33,111
Yeah,

4672
02:02:33,111 --> 02:02:33,944
that's awesome.

4673
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:36,500
He's got a DVD series out now,

4674
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:37,550
a leg lock series.

4675
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:40,370
He shot it and he didn't like it all.

4676
02:02:40,371 --> 02:02:41,270
So he reshot it.

4677
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:42,590
This Reshad at him.

4678
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:43,513
Yeah.

4679
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:43,821
Damn.

4680
02:02:43,821 --> 02:02:44,451
That's pretty cool.

4681
02:02:44,451 --> 02:02:44,661
Yeah,

4682
02:02:44,661 --> 02:02:45,200
it's going to be,

4683
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:47,750
it's going to be funny to see
how far those leg luck game.

4684
02:02:47,751 --> 02:02:51,020
We'll go and him and maybe before we
evolve more and then find the counter to

4685
02:02:51,021 --> 02:02:51,440
that.

4686
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,190
It's like,

4687
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:52,371
well,

4688
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:56,210
what's interesting to me is that this
is essentially all out of a conversation

4689
02:02:56,211 --> 02:02:58,760
that he had with Dean lister.

4690
02:02:59,390 --> 02:02:59,811
You know,

4691
02:02:59,811 --> 02:03:01,580
and it's become a meme now.

4692
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:02,301
It's really funny.

4693
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:05,960
There's a photo of a girl
lying in bed and she's like,

4694
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:08,590
he's probably thinking about
another woman and the guy.

4695
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:09,493
I said,

4696
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:10,100
yeah,

4697
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:12,110
why would you ignore 50% of the day?

4698
02:03:12,111 --> 02:03:12,944
We bought it,

4699
02:03:16,660 --> 02:03:18,600
and I love how John Danaher said it too.

4700
02:03:19,870 --> 02:03:20,201
He says,

4701
02:03:20,201 --> 02:03:21,034
why would you,

4702
02:03:21,230 --> 02:03:22,063
why would you,

4703
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:24,710
why would you ignore
50% of the human body?

4704
02:03:24,711 --> 02:03:25,544
And we're like,

4705
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:26,713
wow,

4706
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:28,490
it makes you uncomfortable around.

4707
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:29,360
He's super smart.

4708
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:30,223
That's awesome.

4709
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:30,860
You know?

4710
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:31,693
He's like,

4711
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:33,650
if you're a blue belt and
he wrote with a black belt,

4712
02:03:33,651 --> 02:03:34,860
you always feel a little
weird around them.

4713
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:36,141
That's how I feel.

4714
02:03:36,141 --> 02:03:37,160
Random intellectually,

4715
02:03:38,630 --> 02:03:39,920
not just physically,

4716
02:03:39,921 --> 02:03:40,850
but they like,

4717
02:03:40,851 --> 02:03:41,021
oh,

4718
02:03:41,021 --> 02:03:41,750
okay.

4719
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:42,890
Can you tell me what it is?

4720
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:43,641
I'm not arguing with you,

4721
02:03:43,641 --> 02:03:44,190
man.

4722
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:44,600
She said,

4723
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:44,901
John,

4724
02:03:44,901 --> 02:03:45,740
take a puff of this.

4725
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:48,430
Does he get hired on?

4726
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:49,400
I don't know,

4727
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:49,750
man.

4728
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:50,780
Probably doesn't have to.

4729
02:03:51,210 --> 02:03:52,640
Probably can do it to his own brain.

4730
02:03:52,790 --> 02:03:54,900
I'll just put myself
in a perfect position.

4731
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:57,980
You wonder if someone
like Elon Musk gets high?

4732
02:03:58,670 --> 02:03:59,600
I would hope so.

4733
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:00,550
Holy Shit.

4734
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:03,020
Fuck that guy is on another level.

4735
02:04:03,070 --> 02:04:06,630
It's aren't they building those
tunnels already under la or they build,

4736
02:04:06,680 --> 02:04:07,130
oh man,

4737
02:04:07,130 --> 02:04:09,830
they got their building that
he's got a boring company.

4738
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:14,120
They're gonna bore holes through La and
reinforce them and you're going to go

4739
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:15,170
through on sleds.

4740
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:18,410
I think they're all like
getting done right now.

4741
02:04:18,530 --> 02:04:18,741
Dude.

4742
02:04:18,741 --> 02:04:22,370
I do not want to be in one of those things
and hear the rumble of the earth and

4743
02:04:22,371 --> 02:04:23,300
see the ocean.

4744
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:24,134
Russia

4745
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:32,570
as tsunami hits the tsunami hits
while you're in one of those pipes.

4746
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:35,090
I wonder if it got out
of that and your butt's

4747
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:38,790
coming from the middle of the ocean.

4748
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:39,624
Just

4749
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:41,673
good.

4750
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,880
Paul's back and thousands of fucking
miles of the earth had been torn apart.

4751
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,700
That shit's happened to gang at times.

4752
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:51,961
Seriously.

4753
02:04:51,961 --> 02:04:52,794
I

4754
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,190
never knew that shit has happened
many times where the cowboy,

4755
02:04:57,220 --> 02:04:59,940
what happened in Fukushima
has happened a ton of times.

4756
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:00,930
We're just,

4757
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:02,010
we don't live long.

4758
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:03,570
So these things,

4759
02:05:03,571 --> 02:05:05,010
they'd seem like they're forever,

4760
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:07,440
but it's based on our lifespan.

4761
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:09,990
Our lifespan is so weird cause it's,

4762
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,250
it's really short.

4763
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,301
You know,

4764
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:14,670
and it seems like it's not because
you're in the middle of it,

4765
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:16,170
but if you look at it objectively,

4766
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:17,160
you're not.

4767
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:21,750
No one makes it out alive and it doesn't
take that long for your body to give

4768
02:05:21,751 --> 02:05:22,350
up.

4769
02:05:22,350 --> 02:05:25,950
So by the time you start figuring things
out and getting your shit together,

4770
02:05:25,951 --> 02:05:29,040
you're already old falling apart.

4771
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:34,580
And all the while we're dealing
with a planet whose time is,

4772
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:36,840
is almost infinite,

4773
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:37,171
right.

4774
02:05:37,171 --> 02:05:37,571
For in,

4775
02:05:37,571 --> 02:05:39,030
in terms of like what we can understand.

4776
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,400
So all these things that
we know have happened,

4777
02:05:41,580 --> 02:05:46,580
even if we study supervolcanoes and
tsunamis and cataclysmic earthquakes and

4778
02:05:46,801 --> 02:05:47,581
solar flares,

4779
02:05:47,581 --> 02:05:48,810
even when we study all those things,

4780
02:05:48,811 --> 02:05:49,320
man,

4781
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,250
we don't think they're real.

4782
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:51,101
They're like,

4783
02:05:51,101 --> 02:05:51,381
yeah,

4784
02:05:51,381 --> 02:05:51,571
yeah,

4785
02:05:51,571 --> 02:05:51,931
but it's,

4786
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:52,141
you know,

4787
02:05:52,141 --> 02:05:52,980
it's Guatemala.

4788
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:54,540
It's only happened in Guatemala.

4789
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:54,811
Yeah,

4790
02:05:54,811 --> 02:05:55,290
it's Hawaii.

4791
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:55,800
But Hey,

4792
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:57,030
they knew they're on an island.

4793
02:05:57,630 --> 02:06:02,340
We can't control this thing when he
houses because we don't think very good

4794
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,040
because we don't realize that we,

4795
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,390
this might not be here in a year,

4796
02:06:06,391 --> 02:06:10,770
there might come a giant wave that
hits those fucking houses are perched.

4797
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:13,980
And Santa Monica perched over
the water and Malibu and shit.

4798
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:15,480
But what are you doing?

4799
02:06:16,410 --> 02:06:18,840
How are you still confident
that water's not going to move?

4800
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:19,380
Ah,

4801
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,910
cause it hasn't moved in 30 years.

4802
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:22,080
That's a second.

4803
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:22,890
No,

4804
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:24,990
in the life of the earth.

4805
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,400
30 years is a second.

4806
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:27,293
Yup.

4807
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:35,840
You put your house on the edge of an
alien world that moves back and forth and

4808
02:06:37,561 --> 02:06:39,450
there's one contractor
who made that decision.

4809
02:06:39,930 --> 02:06:40,763
It'll hold up.

4810
02:06:40,770 --> 02:06:42,240
Well these guys just decide,

4811
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:42,601
right?

4812
02:06:42,601 --> 02:06:43,090
I want to,

4813
02:06:43,090 --> 02:06:46,530
I want to wake up in the morning cause
I'm a winner and I want to do my coffee

4814
02:06:46,650 --> 02:06:49,640
and I want to do my coke and I want to
look out the window and see the fucking

4815
02:06:49,690 --> 02:06:51,720
Ojai money money by then.

4816
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:52,560
Yeah.

4817
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,490
Super amped up.

4818
02:06:53,491 --> 02:06:57,360
Aderall dude's trying to run
the world staring at that water.

4819
02:06:57,361 --> 02:06:58,021
It looks great.

4820
02:06:58,021 --> 02:06:58,854
Fuck yeah.

4821
02:06:58,870 --> 02:07:00,000
Can I ask how can I have water?

4822
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:02,010
Everyone's looking at them
like they got it figured out.

4823
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:04,193
What?

4824
02:07:04,290 --> 02:07:04,891
Oh my God.

4825
02:07:04,891 --> 02:07:07,170
Luxury home teeters on
collapsing off cliff.

4826
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:10,350
So that cliff gave up in the house
is still there in Texas actually.

4827
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:11,543
Oh is it really?

4828
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:11,661
Oh,

4829
02:07:11,661 --> 02:07:13,380
is that Austin Fort Worth?

4830
02:07:13,530 --> 02:07:14,160
Oh Damn.

4831
02:07:14,160 --> 02:07:15,600
Look at that one right above it.

4832
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:15,991
Yo.

4833
02:07:15,991 --> 02:07:16,824
You've got to fix that.

4834
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:18,120
Whoever the contractor is,

4835
02:07:18,121 --> 02:07:18,954
you get into,

4836
02:07:19,550 --> 02:07:20,383
oh,

4837
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:21,473
are you sure

4838
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:24,170
Jamie is real?

4839
02:07:24,260 --> 02:07:25,093
I was thinking,

4840
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:25,651
oh my God,

4841
02:07:25,651 --> 02:07:27,690
that's what Cooper looks fake as fuck.

4842
02:07:27,691 --> 02:07:32,370
Who would trust that fucking shitty idea
of a house hanging off the edge of a

4843
02:07:32,371 --> 02:07:33,204
cliff?

4844
02:07:34,070 --> 02:07:34,410
Whoa.

4845
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:35,243
Look at that thing.

4846
02:07:35,740 --> 02:07:35,980
That's

4847
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:36,610
beautiful.

4848
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:40,180
Is that real futuristic shit that
looks fake her than this one?

4849
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:41,050
This one might be real.

4850
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:42,760
Oh Wow.

4851
02:07:43,660 --> 02:07:45,040
He parks his car on top of that.

4852
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:48,260
What have you heard or
know the night here?

4853
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:51,690
They're like,

4854
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:52,410
oh my God,

4855
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:54,450
we gotta get the fuck off the house,

4856
02:07:54,451 --> 02:07:54,721
honey.

4857
02:07:54,721 --> 02:07:55,860
We're drawing down.

4858
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:56,311
Wait,

4859
02:07:56,311 --> 02:07:56,610
wait.

4860
02:07:56,610 --> 02:07:57,480
I can't find my phone.

4861
02:08:01,290 --> 02:08:02,580
Let Ricky grab his iPad.

4862
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:04,100
He'll

4863
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:05,500
look at you running off in the distance,

4864
02:08:05,501 --> 02:08:08,470
holding the baby under your arm and you
fucking see the house fall off the side

4865
02:08:08,471 --> 02:08:08,980
of the cliff.

4866
02:08:08,980 --> 02:08:09,930
Polo.

4867
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:11,450
Boom.

4868
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:12,890
It is real.

4869
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:14,140
It's real Australia.

4870
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:15,310
Oh my God.

4871
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:16,203
People are crazy.

4872
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:16,931
You couldn't smoke.

4873
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:17,764
I get too paranoid.

4874
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:19,360
Australians don't give a fuck.

4875
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,680
They don't give a fuck.

4876
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:20,921
Oh,

4877
02:08:20,921 --> 02:08:21,800
is that an Australia?

4878
02:08:21,820 --> 02:08:22,210
Those are,

4879
02:08:22,210 --> 02:08:23,600
those are exceptional humans.

4880
02:08:23,890 --> 02:08:24,670
It's sweet.

4881
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:26,140
I'm a big fan of the Australians.

4882
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:26,591
Might be fake.

4883
02:08:26,591 --> 02:08:27,370
Might be fake.

4884
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:27,651
Really.

4885
02:08:27,651 --> 02:08:28,030
Right.

4886
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:31,930
I found an article that looked like it
said it was real and then I just looking

4887
02:08:31,931 --> 02:08:32,960
for more and it says it my,

4888
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,540
like Google said fake after it.

4889
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:35,530
Oh,

4890
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:35,920
well,

4891
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:36,221
sorry.

4892
02:08:36,221 --> 02:08:36,371
You know,

4893
02:08:36,371 --> 02:08:37,204
it's funny,

4894
02:08:37,370 --> 02:08:37,570
uh,

4895
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:38,500
switching subjects,

4896
02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:40,810
but like seeing people that are married,

4897
02:08:40,811 --> 02:08:42,220
husbands that are married to their wife,

4898
02:08:42,221 --> 02:08:43,330
just going through the,

4899
02:08:43,830 --> 02:08:47,560
the classic role of get married and you
got your wife and you don't talk to her

4900
02:08:47,561 --> 02:08:50,170
and go to the boys series explained.

4901
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:50,920
Yeah.

4902
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:51,753
That's a good one.

4903
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:52,623
Did you watch that at all?

4904
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:53,493
Explained?

4905
02:08:53,740 --> 02:08:54,220
No.

4906
02:08:54,220 --> 02:08:55,053
Who's doing that one?

4907
02:08:55,570 --> 02:08:56,980
I'm not sure who's doing that one,

4908
02:08:57,310 --> 02:08:58,630
but it talks about all that stuff.

4909
02:08:58,631 --> 02:08:59,710
Like how,

4910
02:09:00,570 --> 02:09:00,900
um,

4911
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:02,040
monogamy with creative.

4912
02:09:02,080 --> 02:09:02,410
Yeah.

4913
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:04,180
How males aren't made for monogamy.

4914
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:07,900
They're just not all humans
are built more for a,

4915
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:09,250
I explained.

4916
02:09:09,370 --> 02:09:09,850
Yeah.

4917
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:12,220
Well that's probably based on my friend,

4918
02:09:12,670 --> 02:09:14,350
Dr Chris Ryan's book,

4919
02:09:14,440 --> 02:09:15,820
which is sex at dawn,

4920
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:16,350
which is what,

4921
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:17,470
is that what it's based on?

4922
02:09:17,471 --> 02:09:17,760
Yeah.

4923
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:18,330
Yeah.

4924
02:09:18,330 --> 02:09:19,230
It mentions in him.

4925
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:19,421
Oh,

4926
02:09:19,421 --> 02:09:19,710
he's in.

4927
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:19,870
He's,

4928
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:20,310
yeah.

4929
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:20,500
Yeah.

4930
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,450
He's a big proponent of that idea,

4931
02:09:22,690 --> 02:09:23,523
which is very,

4932
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:24,370
it makes a lot of sense.

4933
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:25,690
If you look at the way chimps behave,

4934
02:09:26,190 --> 02:09:26,560
right?

4935
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:27,880
We were the cousins of chimps,

4936
02:09:27,940 --> 02:09:28,391
chimps.

4937
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:29,201
Fuck everybody.

4938
02:09:29,201 --> 02:09:30,250
Everybody fucks everybody.

4939
02:09:30,280 --> 02:09:31,091
So the idea is like,

4940
02:09:31,091 --> 02:09:34,720
how did we get to a place where
everybody stopped fucking everybody in?

4941
02:09:34,721 --> 02:09:36,760
Somewhere along the line in evolution,

4942
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:37,780
it's shifted.

4943
02:09:37,960 --> 02:09:39,820
Whether it's the cultural evolution.

4944
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:40,560
Yeah,

4945
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,470
there's a lot of theories,

4946
02:09:41,471 --> 02:09:41,800
man.

4947
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:42,730
There's a lot of theories.

4948
02:09:43,040 --> 02:09:43,270
Check.

4949
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:45,070
Terence Mckenna had some
weird ideas about it.

4950
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:46,510
His theories were all drug based.

4951
02:09:46,570 --> 02:09:46,960
He all,

4952
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:48,250
he felt there was a mushroom thing.

4953
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:53,550
He felt like a climate change caused
people to move from a mushroom culture to

4954
02:09:54,041 --> 02:09:55,090
an alcohol culture.

4955
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:56,650
And that the,

4956
02:09:56,651 --> 02:10:00,700
the death of the ego and the expanded
consciousness and the community,

4957
02:10:00,720 --> 02:10:01,180
uh,

4958
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:03,790
feelings that you would get
from communal mushroom trips,

4959
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:07,880
all were replaced by
Drunkin assholeishness and,

4960
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:09,011
and chaos.

4961
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:09,380
And you,

4962
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:10,120
he really breaks it.

4963
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:11,020
He broke it down.

4964
02:10:11,050 --> 02:10:11,950
He's not alive anymore,

4965
02:10:11,951 --> 02:10:12,701
but when he was alive,

4966
02:10:12,701 --> 02:10:14,770
he broke it down pretty eloquently.

4967
02:10:14,771 --> 02:10:15,790
And you know,

4968
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:18,820
it's not something I'm smart enough to
know if he's right or if he's wrong,

4969
02:10:18,821 --> 02:10:21,370
but it's a very compelling
argument that people,

4970
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:25,120
because we know that they used to
definitely do a lot of mushrooms.

4971
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:25,480
They knew,

4972
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:27,550
we know the Vikings
did a lot of mushrooms.

4973
02:10:27,551 --> 02:10:28,090
We knew that.

4974
02:10:28,090 --> 02:10:33,090
We know that there's a bunch of ancient
art pieces that show mushrooms and even

4975
02:10:33,201 --> 02:10:36,080
people that were under
the spell of the mushroom,

4976
02:10:36,410 --> 02:10:37,071
like a person,

4977
02:10:37,071 --> 02:10:38,060
like a really old one,

4978
02:10:38,061 --> 02:10:39,760
Jack Hara was showing all the bs.

4979
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:41,450
Jack Hara was his great.

4980
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,560
We'd activist,

4981
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:42,950
uh,

4982
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:43,341
who,

4983
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:43,491
uh,

4984
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:47,330
wrote a book called the emperor has no
clothes and saw a book about him being a

4985
02:10:47,331 --> 02:10:51,560
Goldwater Republican and finding marijuana
and then becoming like this marijuana

4986
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:53,630
advocate and be in a hero for marijuana.

4987
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,750
And he was in the middle
of writing a book.

4988
02:10:57,590 --> 02:10:58,423
Um,

4989
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:02,780
and part of the book was about mushrooms
and Mushrooms in the history of

4990
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:03,710
Christianity.

4991
02:11:04,070 --> 02:11:09,070
And he had all this ancient artwork
that was all had mushroom iconography,

4992
02:11:09,411 --> 02:11:11,030
like mushroom images in it.

4993
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:11,931
And he was like,

4994
02:11:11,931 --> 02:11:13,460
the shit was everywhere.

4995
02:11:13,590 --> 02:11:15,800
He unfortunately had a stroke
and then wound up dying.

4996
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:19,230
He was a great man and in the world of uh,

4997
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:19,941
marijuana,

4998
02:11:19,941 --> 02:11:22,080
he's certainly hero risky,

4999
02:11:22,160 --> 02:11:23,930
risked his neck like way,

5000
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:25,550
way early on and you know,

5001
02:11:25,551 --> 02:11:27,250
stood by his beliefs and can talk,

5002
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:28,640
cut a lot of shit for his book,

5003
02:11:28,641 --> 02:11:31,730
but also got a lot of
love for how he stood for,

5004
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:32,571
you know,

5005
02:11:32,571 --> 02:11:34,880
a guy opening up as mine and changing his,

5006
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:35,530
mind me,

5007
02:11:35,530 --> 02:11:37,160
he was a staunch Republican.

5008
02:11:37,370 --> 02:11:42,350
They started smoking pot and became this
crazy pot advocate and his next thing

5009
02:11:42,500 --> 02:11:43,520
was about mushrooms.

5010
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:44,421
Man,

5011
02:11:44,421 --> 02:11:45,470
how awesome is that?

5012
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:46,470
And there's some immune,

5013
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:48,170
there's a lot of stuff out
there that you can read.

5014
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:48,711
The,

5015
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:52,940
it was a lot of good articles online
where people have shown there's ancient

5016
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:57,941
images of Adam and Eve from a fresco
and France from like a long fucking time

5017
02:11:58,461 --> 02:11:58,641
ago.

5018
02:11:58,641 --> 02:12:00,140
See if he could see that mush,

5019
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:03,230
Adam and Eve mushroom fresco,

5020
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:04,051
just like you were saying,

5021
02:12:04,051 --> 02:12:04,340
John,

5022
02:12:04,340 --> 02:12:04,581
you're like,

5023
02:12:04,581 --> 02:12:05,150
how do we know?

5024
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:08,150
Like some of that Bible wasn't
people writing stories on mushrooms.

5025
02:12:08,210 --> 02:12:08,800
Oh yeah,

5026
02:12:08,800 --> 02:12:09,230
sure.

5027
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:09,471
Well,

5028
02:12:09,471 --> 02:12:12,110
there's a lot of people that believe
it's entirely possible that that's the

5029
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:12,740
case.

5030
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:16,550
There was actually a recent
scholar from Jerusalem that,

5031
02:12:16,551 --> 02:12:16,911
thanks,

5032
02:12:16,911 --> 02:12:17,241
you see,

5033
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:21,050
this is the image that's Adam and eve
and look at those mushrooms and not even

5034
02:12:21,051 --> 02:12:21,501
mushrooms.

5035
02:12:21,501 --> 02:12:23,240
Iowasca for those Bible stories.

5036
02:12:23,241 --> 02:12:23,541
It's like,

5037
02:12:23,541 --> 02:12:24,220
holy fuck.

5038
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:24,771
Who knows?

5039
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:24,951
I mean,

5040
02:12:24,951 --> 02:12:27,020
who knows when they
figured out Iowasca right,

5041
02:12:27,021 --> 02:12:27,280
and who,

5042
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,250
who got ahold of it?

5043
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:31,040
We know that they had it in South
America thousands of years ago.

5044
02:12:31,041 --> 02:12:31,341
We don't,

5045
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:33,050
we don't know how many thousands though.

5046
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:33,561
Apparently.

5047
02:12:33,561 --> 02:12:34,700
It's really hard to figure out.

5048
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:35,750
But look at that image.

5049
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:40,340
13th Century Fresco depicting an Adam
and eve and the tree of knowledge.

5050
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:44,210
That tree appears to be modeled
after an ama to miscarry a mushroom.

5051
02:12:44,740 --> 02:12:45,573
Oh,

5052
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:46,130
whoa.

5053
02:12:46,130 --> 02:12:47,240
This is the tree of knowledge.

5054
02:12:47,240 --> 02:12:47,481
I mean,

5055
02:12:47,481 --> 02:12:47,721
dude,

5056
02:12:47,721 --> 02:12:49,400
this is from the 12 hundreds right?

5057
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:50,660
So this is,

5058
02:12:50,840 --> 02:12:55,400
this is closer to the bone than the
original story than we are now in terms of

5059
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:56,460
is,

5060
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:57,293
I don't know,

5061
02:12:57,620 --> 02:13:01,910
I think there's something on the
ballot in California to legalize it.

5062
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:02,290
God,

5063
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:02,931
I hope they do.

5064
02:13:02,931 --> 02:13:04,340
Even if they just do it for therapy.

5065
02:13:04,341 --> 02:13:04,940
Seriously.

5066
02:13:04,940 --> 02:13:05,330
Yeah.

5067
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:10,330
Just there's a lot of these old old
pictures that have mushrooms in with a

5068
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:12,920
religious icons.

5069
02:13:13,490 --> 02:13:14,330
It's real weird,

5070
02:13:14,331 --> 02:13:14,570
man.

5071
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:16,760
Like think of this Jesus
with mushrooms and his feet.

5072
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:19,110
There's a bunch of crazy,

5073
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,180
there's a bunch of these
really old weird picking it,

5074
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:23,960
but the thing is like
what is it evidence of?

5075
02:13:23,961 --> 02:13:28,490
Is it evidence that mushrooms were
involved in the creation of Christianity?

5076
02:13:28,491 --> 02:13:29,031
Possibly,

5077
02:13:29,031 --> 02:13:30,710
but it's also evidence that artists do.

5078
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:32,913
Yeah.

5079
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:33,721
For Real,

5080
02:13:33,721 --> 02:13:34,480
man.

5081
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:35,320
You're a fucking guy.

5082
02:13:35,321 --> 02:13:36,330
He's a paid her back then.

5083
02:13:36,331 --> 02:13:38,880
Maybe you're doing mushrooms all the
time and you want to put the mushrooms in

5084
02:13:38,881 --> 02:13:39,714
everything.

5085
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,340
We don't really know what I mean.

5086
02:13:42,150 --> 02:13:45,290
Especially if he's doing mushrooms and
nobody else even knows what they are.

5087
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:45,571
He's like,

5088
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:45,960
listen,

5089
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:46,680
this is one of the,

5090
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:50,340
but I gotta I gotta think that everybody
knew about him back then and they

5091
02:13:50,341 --> 02:13:52,470
probably shared them with
people that they cared about.

5092
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:55,050
Because if you lived in a world with,

5093
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:56,280
just think of it this way,

5094
02:13:56,820 --> 02:13:59,010
you lived in a world with no media.

5095
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:00,540
You have no books,

5096
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:02,040
you have no science.

5097
02:14:02,070 --> 02:14:03,390
You have stories,

5098
02:14:03,391 --> 02:14:05,040
you have a crude language.

5099
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:06,360
You write things down,

5100
02:14:06,361 --> 02:14:07,530
you draw things.

5101
02:14:07,830 --> 02:14:09,090
There's no TV shows,

5102
02:14:09,091 --> 02:14:10,260
there's no cars,

5103
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,460
there's no nothing.

5104
02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:14,430
There's no history of history
of talking about shit.

5105
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:17,400
You wouldn't you think
if you found mushrooms,

5106
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:22,350
if your life suck that much ass like
this is the world you're living in his

5107
02:14:22,351 --> 02:14:26,790
barbarian's everywhere and you'd get
fucking step on a thorn and you get

5108
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:29,850
poisoned in your body and you die
because no one has antibiotics.

5109
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:31,590
You get an infection from a cut,

5110
02:14:31,591 --> 02:14:32,424
you're dead.

5111
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:33,090
I mean this is,

5112
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:34,890
this is how people existed back then.

5113
02:14:34,891 --> 02:14:37,860
Do you think if they
found mushrooms that they,

5114
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:39,780
they wouldn't cherish them like that?

5115
02:14:39,781 --> 02:14:42,300
Someone would somehow under
the demonize them for real.

5116
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:43,140
Seriously.

5117
02:14:43,140 --> 02:14:44,130
If they had nothing else,

5118
02:14:44,131 --> 02:14:45,360
why would they demonize mushrooms?

5119
02:14:45,361 --> 02:14:47,400
They demonized it after
they figured it out.

5120
02:14:47,730 --> 02:14:48,600
After they figured out like,

5121
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:48,960
hey,

5122
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:51,840
like they probably went
big gaps without having it.

5123
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:52,890
That's the theory.

5124
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:56,520
They probably don't like big gaps where
mushrooms weren't apart of culture

5125
02:14:56,521 --> 02:14:58,350
anymore and then people
tried to reintroduce them,

5126
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:01,920
but culture had already gone in
this weird sort of violent champ.

5127
02:15:02,160 --> 02:15:03,180
Alcohol,

5128
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:04,890
amphetamines way.

5129
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:06,240
Damn,

5130
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:06,960
damn,

5131
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:07,620
fuck,

5132
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,453
fuck.

5133
02:15:08,490 --> 02:15:09,323
Oh

5134
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:10,741
yeah.

5135
02:15:10,741 --> 02:15:12,240
It's not like we're making something up.

5136
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:15,330
Like this is some Alice in wonderland
book where there's some medicine that says

5137
02:15:15,331 --> 02:15:17,850
drink me and if we drank we are
going to go on this journey.

5138
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:18,350
Yeah.

5139
02:15:18,350 --> 02:15:19,260
That's just a book.

5140
02:15:19,261 --> 02:15:21,660
Mushrooms are real and they're everywhere.

5141
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:22,170
Yeah.

5142
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:25,140
I mean there's parts of the country they
just fucking grow and constantly it's

5143
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:28,680
Praysee w when you talk about people that
were living in it back in that day and

5144
02:15:28,681 --> 02:15:29,610
how tough it was,

5145
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:34,050
you wonder if they had dislike as much
happiness as we have if there are more

5146
02:15:34,051 --> 02:15:35,090
positive thinking or what?

5147
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:35,731
I don't know what I mean.

5148
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:38,430
Like it's a good question because
they didn't know any better.

5149
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:39,241
They might have had a more,

5150
02:15:39,241 --> 02:15:42,120
it's like this guy that wrote this book,

5151
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:43,380
Jesse Itzler this,

5152
02:15:43,381 --> 02:15:45,300
this book is in front of
you living with a seal.

5153
02:15:45,780 --> 02:15:47,100
He also wrote a book,

5154
02:15:47,130 --> 02:15:47,370
uh,

5155
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:48,600
living with monks and he was,

5156
02:15:48,601 --> 02:15:50,280
he was just here and he just,

5157
02:15:50,281 --> 02:15:50,460
uh,

5158
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:53,790
was talking about it was really
fucking interesting shit man.

5159
02:15:53,791 --> 02:15:54,061
Damn,

5160
02:15:54,061 --> 02:15:54,870
I bet.

5161
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:56,100
Really interesting shit.

5162
02:15:56,101 --> 02:15:56,311
Yeah.

5163
02:15:56,311 --> 02:15:57,660
But one of the things he
was telling me was like,

5164
02:15:57,661 --> 02:15:58,890
how happy these guys are.

5165
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:01,140
They're just meditate all day.

5166
02:16:01,290 --> 02:16:02,550
They just do their job.

5167
02:16:02,551 --> 02:16:05,100
They train dogs and they meditate all day.

5168
02:16:05,101 --> 02:16:05,701
That's crazy.

5169
02:16:05,701 --> 02:16:07,710
It was like they're all
really happy and he was like,

5170
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:10,260
how many people do you think in
the real world are really happy?

5171
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:10,561
I'm like,

5172
02:16:10,561 --> 02:16:10,960
I don't know.

5173
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:11,260
And he said,

5174
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:12,480
60 something percent.

5175
02:16:12,481 --> 02:16:17,481
Would you say 67 67% or how
they got a happy or unhappy?

5176
02:16:17,940 --> 02:16:18,421
Unhappy.

5177
02:16:18,421 --> 02:16:18,930
Yeah.

5178
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:20,520
67% are unhappy.

5179
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,670
Oh,

5180
02:16:20,670 --> 02:16:21,241
I'm sure.

5181
02:16:21,241 --> 02:16:22,011
Fuck duty.

5182
02:16:22,011 --> 02:16:22,740
Even that,

5183
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:23,101
I'm like,

5184
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:23,401
whoa.

5185
02:16:23,401 --> 02:16:24,000
Really?

5186
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,050
Like there's what?

5187
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:26,970
33% people happy.

5188
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:28,350
That's more than I expected.

5189
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:29,300
She truly,

5190
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:30,340
that are truly happy,

5191
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:32,590
truly happy doing what
they want every day.

5192
02:16:32,591 --> 02:16:32,831
Yeah.

5193
02:16:32,831 --> 02:16:33,550
There's not,

5194
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:34,383
that's hard.

5195
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:35,201
God,

5196
02:16:35,201 --> 02:16:35,560
I'm so,

5197
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:35,920
yeah,

5198
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:38,590
you lucky or super,

5199
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:39,971
super lucky.

5200
02:16:39,971 --> 02:16:41,080
Anybody out there that's listening,

5201
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:42,010
it's doing what they want.

5202
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:46,690
Whether you're making furniture or
painting pictures or singing songs,

5203
02:16:46,691 --> 02:16:47,620
what are the fuck you're doing?

5204
02:16:47,621 --> 02:16:49,900
If that's what you really
want to do and you're happy.

5205
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:50,101
Yeah.

5206
02:16:50,101 --> 02:16:51,430
You gotta pay it back.

5207
02:16:51,431 --> 02:16:52,810
And even if you're not making a fortune,

5208
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:53,321
no,

5209
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:53,831
you listen.

5210
02:16:53,831 --> 02:16:55,810
If you're getting by
and doing what you like,

5211
02:16:55,811 --> 02:16:57,730
it's so much better than being rich,

5212
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:02,650
doing what you hate because your time is
what's so valuable when you know if you

5213
02:17:02,651 --> 02:17:04,600
have a job and you hate it,

5214
02:17:05,140 --> 02:17:06,610
but it gives you a lot
of money and you say,

5215
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:06,731
well,

5216
02:17:06,731 --> 02:17:07,840
I'm going to get out of it eventually.

5217
02:17:07,841 --> 02:17:11,500
The problem is that time that you
need to do that job at eight hours,

5218
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:14,020
that's a giant chunk of your day,

5219
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:15,910
but a lot of people
don't have passions too.

5220
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:17,050
What would they be doing?

5221
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:17,950
Those was eight hours a day.

5222
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,280
A lot of people don't even know.

5223
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:22,210
They look like my dad gets
off work and goes to work.

5224
02:17:22,211 --> 02:17:22,480
He's like,

5225
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,080
what is he doing?

5226
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:23,913
You know,

5227
02:17:24,220 --> 02:17:25,390
what do you want to get good at?

5228
02:17:25,391 --> 02:17:25,860
What do you,

5229
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,681
what are you passion about?

5230
02:17:26,681 --> 02:17:27,461
What do you want to do?

5231
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:31,090
And it's easier for like this newer
day and age to look on the Internet and

5232
02:17:31,091 --> 02:17:33,160
learn things on the Internet and
see people on the Internet doing.

5233
02:17:33,161 --> 02:17:33,400
I'd be like,

5234
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:33,521
oh,

5235
02:17:33,521 --> 02:17:33,911
they're doing it.

5236
02:17:33,911 --> 02:17:35,470
I'm not doing it in our
parents' generation.

5237
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:36,304
They didn't have that.

5238
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:37,870
Everyone did it and they had no,

5239
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:38,943
it was rare.

5240
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:42,940
You're super lucky if you
find a passion that you,

5241
02:17:43,430 --> 02:17:43,810
gosh,

5242
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:46,420
at a young age and back
then everybody was scared,

5243
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:47,111
right?

5244
02:17:47,111 --> 02:17:48,700
So they would always tell people don't,

5245
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:49,720
don't do that.

5246
02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:51,310
Don't take any risks,

5247
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:52,300
play it safe.

5248
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:53,890
Get that good job.

5249
02:17:54,130 --> 02:17:54,401
You know,

5250
02:17:54,401 --> 02:17:55,450
they're given benefits.

5251
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:56,530
You'll get your degree,

5252
02:17:57,040 --> 02:17:57,873
play it safe,

5253
02:17:58,090 --> 02:17:58,361
you know?

5254
02:17:58,361 --> 02:17:59,870
Well if you have a degree
then you'll have to,

5255
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:01,360
you'll definitely have a backup plan.

5256
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:02,111
You know,

5257
02:18:02,111 --> 02:18:03,280
you want to have a safety net.

5258
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:04,630
Everyone back then was,

5259
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:06,730
their parents had been in
the fucking depression.

5260
02:18:06,731 --> 02:18:07,270
Man.

5261
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:08,650
Even when I had grown up,

5262
02:18:08,680 --> 02:18:10,030
people are kind of telling me like,

5263
02:18:10,150 --> 02:18:10,371
no,

5264
02:18:10,371 --> 02:18:11,610
you're going to fight for like,

5265
02:18:11,620 --> 02:18:12,490
what are you gonna do for work?

5266
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:15,100
How many 50 year olds do you know that?

5267
02:18:15,101 --> 02:18:16,300
Like you want to see and be like,

5268
02:18:16,301 --> 02:18:16,541
man,

5269
02:18:16,541 --> 02:18:17,171
I want my life.

5270
02:18:17,171 --> 02:18:20,460
Like there's like someone like
you or Paul check like you got,

5271
02:18:20,560 --> 02:18:22,630
it seems like at your
age that's pretty rare.

5272
02:18:22,930 --> 02:18:25,790
People fall apart and what
they want the ride is it's,

5273
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:26,673
you know,

5274
02:18:26,740 --> 02:18:28,270
everybody can,

5275
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:30,191
you know,

5276
02:18:30,191 --> 02:18:31,830
if you've watched one of
those mechanical bulls,

5277
02:18:32,160 --> 02:18:36,130
it was Wa watch when people do start
ramping it up the beginning everybody can

5278
02:18:36,131 --> 02:18:38,020
hang on everybody hang on.

5279
02:18:38,410 --> 02:18:42,310
But as life gets more and more
complicated to get older and older,

5280
02:18:42,311 --> 02:18:43,840
your body starts failing.

5281
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:48,250
You got to stay on your exercise program
or you feel yourself to tea where

5282
02:18:48,251 --> 02:18:48,910
you're rating.

5283
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:51,730
Like you've realized like
how long can I keep this up?

5284
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:52,960
How long can I keep this going?

5285
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,110
You know?

5286
02:18:54,110 --> 02:18:57,670
And and also people who have been doing
what they don't want to do for 20 years

5287
02:18:57,671 --> 02:18:59,980
now waiting to retire 25 years.

5288
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:00,810
Yup.

5289
02:19:00,810 --> 02:19:01,810
To me,

5290
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:04,120
my number one for sure,

5291
02:19:04,290 --> 02:19:07,360
the most fortunate thing is the
people that I'm friends with.

5292
02:19:07,361 --> 02:19:10,190
And then I love my family and
people I'm close to though.

5293
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:14,740
I'm close to a bunch of really positive
people that have similar mindsets to

5294
02:19:14,741 --> 02:19:18,460
yours about eating healthy and taking
care of yourself at that for sure.

5295
02:19:18,700 --> 02:19:20,140
Also about being nice.

5296
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:21,160
That's salt,

5297
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:22,330
that's real important.

5298
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:25,540
Being around a bunch of people that are
cool to each other and then to doing

5299
02:19:25,541 --> 02:19:26,470
what I want to do.

5300
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:28,010
Cause I didn't do what I

5301
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:29,360
want to do and I've looked,

5302
02:19:29,450 --> 02:19:32,360
I don't want to anybody to cry
for me that I was on fear factor.

5303
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:34,010
It's not like it was a bad job.

5304
02:19:34,011 --> 02:19:36,620
I would've taken it again in a heartbeat
if I was in the same situation.

5305
02:19:36,621 --> 02:19:37,454
It was great.

5306
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:37,821
You know,

5307
02:19:37,821 --> 02:19:38,060
it's,

5308
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:39,110
it offered me money,

5309
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:42,230
a lot of money to do a show that
wasn't anything I wanted to do.

5310
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:43,580
Like it wasn't a sitcom,

5311
02:19:43,850 --> 02:19:45,330
it wasn't doing standup comedy.

5312
02:19:45,331 --> 02:19:46,310
It was this weird thing,

5313
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:47,630
but it was a great job.

5314
02:19:47,660 --> 02:19:48,493
Like I'm not,

5315
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:49,880
I'm not hating on it,

5316
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:51,740
but it doesn't feel the same way.

5317
02:19:51,741 --> 02:19:53,750
Even though I'm very
thankful that I got that job.

5318
02:19:53,751 --> 02:19:58,580
It doesn't feel the same way as it would
if I was say doing a podcast or doing

5319
02:19:58,581 --> 02:20:00,230
standup or just doing
whatever I want to do.

5320
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:01,820
We're not off to what I have to.

5321
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:06,380
I don't have to do something
just because it's my job.

5322
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:07,731
Instead,

5323
02:20:07,731 --> 02:20:09,590
I do it because I actually like to do it.

5324
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:12,380
You don't have to watch your p's and
q's all the time cause you're in the

5325
02:20:12,381 --> 02:20:14,300
corporate world and be watching yourself.

5326
02:20:14,301 --> 02:20:14,720
Man.

5327
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:14,991
I mean,

5328
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:16,100
I fuck up all the time.

5329
02:20:16,101 --> 02:20:17,600
I say stupid things all the time.

5330
02:20:17,601 --> 02:20:17,991
If people are like,

5331
02:20:17,991 --> 02:20:18,561
why'd you say that?

5332
02:20:18,561 --> 02:20:21,860
Am I because I'm free ball and I'm say
things off the top of my head for hours

5333
02:20:21,861 --> 02:20:23,120
at a time or a case.

5334
02:20:23,121 --> 02:20:23,361
Yeah.

5335
02:20:23,361 --> 02:20:25,130
Occasionally I'll say something stupid.

5336
02:20:25,370 --> 02:20:26,750
I take a swing and a miss.

5337
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:27,220
Yeah.

5338
02:20:27,220 --> 02:20:27,710
Yeah.

5339
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:28,320
But,

5340
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:28,550
uh,

5341
02:20:28,550 --> 02:20:29,990
ultimately it's,

5342
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:31,221
you know,

5343
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:31,471
I'm,

5344
02:20:31,471 --> 02:20:33,890
I'm going to try to police
myself as best as I can,

5345
02:20:33,891 --> 02:20:37,670
but it's just so much better
than having to piece somebody.

5346
02:20:37,671 --> 02:20:40,550
It gives you a chance to
get better at your own shit.

5347
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,331
You know,

5348
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:42,230
whatever you're doing,

5349
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:45,530
if you can work for yourself or figure
out a way to do the thing that you really

5350
02:20:45,531 --> 02:20:46,364
want to do,

5351
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:49,310
it gives you a chance to get better
at the thing that interests you.

5352
02:20:49,311 --> 02:20:50,710
The thing that's fascinating.

5353
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:50,771
Yeah.

5354
02:20:50,771 --> 02:20:50,840
Mean

5355
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:51,660
to you.

5356
02:20:51,660 --> 02:20:51,901
Yeah,

5357
02:20:51,901 --> 02:20:52,521
it's pretty sweet.

5358
02:20:52,521 --> 02:20:53,251
It's super lucky.

5359
02:20:53,251 --> 02:20:54,030
When I was,

5360
02:20:54,030 --> 02:20:55,170
when I first moved to Arizona,

5361
02:20:55,171 --> 02:20:55,500
I had,

5362
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:56,340
I didn't have to work,

5363
02:20:56,341 --> 02:20:58,950
I'd like sponsored local
sponsors back in Montana.

5364
02:20:59,490 --> 02:21:00,323
Um,

5365
02:21:01,090 --> 02:21:01,770
um,

5366
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:02,910
this thing bar the one,

5367
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:04,670
give them a shout out this thing.

5368
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:05,130
Uh,

5369
02:21:05,130 --> 02:21:07,170
Elliot Smith and Jones labs construction.

5370
02:21:07,171 --> 02:21:07,800
Yeah.

5371
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:08,440
Their lunch.

5372
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:11,100
That just for a small town
companies that work and I,

5373
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:16,110
I was able to put all of my time
into learning how to eat healthy,

5374
02:21:16,180 --> 02:21:19,110
learning how to use my brain and training.

5375
02:21:19,140 --> 02:21:20,690
Like I got to use all my time for that.

5376
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:21,810
I was so lucky for that.

5377
02:21:21,811 --> 02:21:22,644
And,

5378
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:23,860
and it's not,

5379
02:21:23,860 --> 02:21:25,110
it's huge for young fighters,

5380
02:21:25,111 --> 02:21:25,440
you know,

5381
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:29,070
getting a cool business and what's to put
their logo on your shorts or something

5382
02:21:29,071 --> 02:21:29,904
like that.

5383
02:21:29,910 --> 02:21:31,980
That's where we benefited
from coming from a small town.

5384
02:21:31,981 --> 02:21:34,230
We racked up a lot of experience.

5385
02:21:34,410 --> 02:21:37,620
Like in Phoenix there's amateur fighters
that they can't get fights for the life

5386
02:21:37,621 --> 02:21:38,230
of them.

5387
02:21:38,230 --> 02:21:40,080
We could fight every
weekend if we wanted to.

5388
02:21:40,081 --> 02:21:42,990
So we got a lot of re reading
experience and got comfortable in there.

5389
02:21:43,440 --> 02:21:43,651
Yeah,

5390
02:21:43,651 --> 02:21:45,420
there's a crazy Midwest circuit,

5391
02:21:45,421 --> 02:21:45,750
right?

5392
02:21:45,750 --> 02:21:45,990
Like,

5393
02:21:45,990 --> 02:21:49,590
that's why Jeremy Horn has over a
hundred fights and Travis Fulton was,

5394
02:21:49,591 --> 02:21:51,050
he have like 200 plus fights.

5395
02:21:51,150 --> 02:21:51,983
Crazy like that,

5396
02:21:52,260 --> 02:21:53,250
but a lot of those dudes,

5397
02:21:53,251 --> 02:21:55,740
you mean you could literally
fight constantly all the time?

5398
02:21:55,770 --> 02:21:56,130
Yup.

5399
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:58,110
I fought three weekends in
a row once I remember that.

5400
02:21:58,170 --> 02:21:59,070
That's nuts.

5401
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:01,950
But don't you get super
loose when you do that?

5402
02:22:02,340 --> 02:22:03,830
You get like used to it.

5403
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:04,550
Yeah.

5404
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:06,300
The experience is different,

5405
02:22:06,301 --> 02:22:06,481
right?

5406
02:22:06,481 --> 02:22:07,230
It feels normal.

5407
02:22:07,230 --> 02:22:07,980
Oh yeah,

5408
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:08,700
for sure.

5409
02:22:08,700 --> 02:22:12,260
I remember going into like bigger fights
and people would kind of thing to get

5410
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:12,571
anything there.

5411
02:22:12,571 --> 02:22:13,090
I was like,

5412
02:22:13,090 --> 02:22:13,801
I don't think I will.

5413
02:22:13,801 --> 02:22:16,080
I just don't get like before
if I don't feel nervous,

5414
02:22:16,081 --> 02:22:16,280
I'm,

5415
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:17,113
how do you feel?

5416
02:22:17,220 --> 02:22:18,090
I feel calm.

5417
02:22:18,091 --> 02:22:20,760
I feel like I feel like I'm just calm,

5418
02:22:20,850 --> 02:22:22,100
just ready for,

5419
02:22:22,140 --> 02:22:23,820
I'm just waiting for,

5420
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:27,030
I feel like I'm really the now and
I'm just waiting for to get there.

5421
02:22:27,031 --> 02:22:27,660
I'm just,

5422
02:22:27,660 --> 02:22:28,680
what are you thinking about?

5423
02:22:29,660 --> 02:22:30,300
I'm,

5424
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,081
I feel calm.

5425
02:22:31,081 --> 02:22:31,471
I don't know.

5426
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:33,540
It's just super confident.

5427
02:22:33,541 --> 02:22:34,374
I know.

5428
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:34,920
Like I,

5429
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:35,341
in my head,

5430
02:22:35,341 --> 02:22:35,851
I'm going in there,

5431
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:36,840
I'm going to knock this dude out.

5432
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:37,950
Whether I do or don't.

5433
02:22:38,220 --> 02:22:38,671
That's what I'm,

5434
02:22:38,671 --> 02:22:39,270
that's what every,

5435
02:22:39,270 --> 02:22:40,170
every fight I get into.

5436
02:22:40,171 --> 02:22:42,570
I'm going in there thinking I'm gonna
knock this dude out every fight.

5437
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:44,700
And I truly feel that,

5438
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:46,050
I believe that in myself.

5439
02:22:46,290 --> 02:22:48,810
And it all comes from
how prepared you are.

5440
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:50,910
He's always doing every single thing,

5441
02:22:50,911 --> 02:22:51,310
not like,

5442
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:52,590
I'm going to be lazy today.

5443
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:54,900
Every sing he has to do,

5444
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:58,200
and that's the reason he feels so
fucking prepared and can focus on her

5445
02:22:58,201 --> 02:23:00,600
techniques and can focus on
that instead of focus on,

5446
02:23:00,630 --> 02:23:00,811
oh,

5447
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:05,490
am I going to gas or did I train hard
enough or fuck all that nonsense shit.

5448
02:23:05,840 --> 02:23:06,673
Yeah.

5449
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:08,191
Yeah.

5450
02:23:08,191 --> 02:23:12,690
I was listening to someone talk about
that the other day that wish I could

5451
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:14,250
remember who was having this conversation.

5452
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:16,110
It might've been my friend John Dudley,

5453
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:20,250
but he was talking about how when people
aren't prepared for things that it

5454
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:25,310
gives you like another layer of insecurity
on top of the insecurity of doing

5455
02:23:26,161 --> 02:23:27,750
something that's difficult
in the first place.

5456
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,580
So if you know that you're not like,

5457
02:23:29,581 --> 02:23:32,940
maybe you're good at it but you're just
lazy and you didn't really practice and

5458
02:23:32,941 --> 02:23:34,260
then you're going to go
and try and do something,

5459
02:23:34,261 --> 02:23:36,540
but you know these other people are
practice much harder than you have.

5460
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:41,930
That layer is even if you're a talented
person that's like that has an effect on

5461
02:23:42,871 --> 02:23:46,860
your actions and if you've
done everything you can do,

5462
02:23:46,861 --> 02:23:50,220
you've dotted all your i's
and crossed all your t's.

5463
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:52,050
If you've done that,

5464
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:54,690
you'll have a different
level of confidence.

5465
02:23:54,750 --> 02:23:55,860
You might still lose,

5466
02:23:55,861 --> 02:23:56,101
right?

5467
02:23:56,101 --> 02:23:58,860
It's a crazy way to make live in
the chips fall where they may,

5468
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:04,100
but at least you'll know that you gave
100% now if you lose and you didn't give

5469
02:24:04,951 --> 02:24:06,930
100% you definitely still have.

5470
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:09,840
You always have that in the back
of your head as like a fallback.

5471
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:10,351
Hey,

5472
02:24:10,351 --> 02:24:14,700
I know I didn't really give
100% but you could say,

5473
02:24:14,701 --> 02:24:14,911
well,

5474
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:15,241
well,

5475
02:24:15,241 --> 02:24:16,590
I'm going to get my shit together now,

5476
02:24:16,591 --> 02:24:20,370
but the problem is you've already gone
through the experience of not giving 100%

5477
02:24:20,371 --> 02:24:24,450
which is very precarious because it could
be a confidence destroyer could fuck

5478
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:25,620
your head up for the rest of your life.

5479
02:24:25,621 --> 02:24:28,980
It could change who you are because it's
very difficult for people to overcome

5480
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:33,330
the past like ideas that they have
about themselves from a year ago or five

5481
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:34,164
years ago.

5482
02:24:34,200 --> 02:24:35,890
That is not you and you.

5483
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:36,570
You have to,

5484
02:24:36,570 --> 02:24:40,430
especially in something as critical
as like fight skills and learning,

5485
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:42,690
learning how to become confident again.

5486
02:24:42,930 --> 02:24:43,770
That's not you.

5487
02:24:43,800 --> 02:24:44,461
That was you.

5488
02:24:44,461 --> 02:24:48,360
Then your better now embrace
the fact that you're better.

5489
02:24:48,361 --> 02:24:53,361
Don't dwell on bad moments where you
got flattened or you're fucked up or you

5490
02:24:54,391 --> 02:24:56,580
did something stupid or you
got caught in an arm bar,

5491
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:57,720
whatever the fuck it is,

5492
02:24:57,900 --> 02:25:02,820
those things they can get in your head
and you can decide you're that person or

5493
02:25:02,821 --> 02:25:03,750
you can decide,

5494
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:04,763
no,

5495
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,920
I've passed that now I'm
way better because of that.

5496
02:25:07,921 --> 02:25:11,760
I'm thankful that happened because that
taught me as super valuable lesson and

5497
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:15,550
without that humiliation and that
defeat or that misstep or you know,

5498
02:25:15,650 --> 02:25:16,830
whatever that error was,

5499
02:25:16,831 --> 02:25:18,900
I would know who I really am right now.

5500
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,440
Yeah.

5501
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:23,110
It's like classic sports psychology stuff
and you can't just read it one to be

5502
02:25:23,111 --> 02:25:23,261
like,

5503
02:25:23,261 --> 02:25:23,621
okay,

5504
02:25:23,621 --> 02:25:24,180
I get that.

5505
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:26,920
You got to fucking just wrap it in
your head wrapped around your head.

5506
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:27,850
And I think,

5507
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:29,350
I truly think in a fist fight.

5508
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:31,240
The number one thing is confidence.

5509
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:34,600
And I know that confidence comes from
training and also helps to have that

5510
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:35,201
fucking rumble.

5511
02:25:35,201 --> 02:25:36,310
Johnson power sun,

5512
02:25:39,510 --> 02:25:40,450
that might also be a

5513
02:25:42,190 --> 02:25:43,120
rumble Johnson,

5514
02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:43,361
Cory,

5515
02:25:43,361 --> 02:25:44,760
you rely on people,

5516
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:46,360
you rely on it too much.

5517
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:48,850
And that's why I don't necessarily
think he relied on the too much,

5518
02:25:49,490 --> 02:25:53,290
but I really think about rumble
is rumble was better than he was,

5519
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:53,890
um,

5520
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:55,330
enthusiastic about fighting.

5521
02:25:55,720 --> 02:25:56,680
He was a better fight.

5522
02:25:56,710 --> 02:25:57,910
Like he said it,

5523
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:59,950
he was a phenomenal knockout artists.

5524
02:25:59,951 --> 02:26:00,161
I mean,

5525
02:26:00,161 --> 02:26:02,170
rumble put it to people,

5526
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:02,651
you know,

5527
02:26:02,651 --> 02:26:03,520
a spooky way.

5528
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:05,140
He would cry when he knocked out,

5529
02:26:05,141 --> 02:26:08,020
glow over to shower and to
share that one upper cut.

5530
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:08,883
Boom.

5531
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:12,520
You've watched that precision
and the power that guy generated.

5532
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:13,121
Damn.

5533
02:26:13,121 --> 02:26:13,954
He was scary.

5534
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:14,501
Damn.

5535
02:26:14,501 --> 02:26:15,334
He was scared,

5536
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:17,050
but when bill said,

5537
02:26:17,051 --> 02:26:17,741
when he retired,

5538
02:26:17,741 --> 02:26:17,981
he said,

5539
02:26:17,981 --> 02:26:18,311
hey man.

5540
02:26:18,311 --> 02:26:18,551
He goes,

5541
02:26:18,551 --> 02:26:19,361
I'm just good at this.

5542
02:26:19,361 --> 02:26:19,541
He goes,

5543
02:26:19,541 --> 02:26:20,374
I'm not a fighter.

5544
02:26:20,530 --> 02:26:21,000
He was,

5545
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:21,833
I'm an athlete.

5546
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:22,241
He goes,

5547
02:26:22,241 --> 02:26:22,991
I'm just good at this.

5548
02:26:22,991 --> 02:26:23,850
I don't want to do this anymore.

5549
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:24,820
I could do a lot of other things.

5550
02:26:24,821 --> 02:26:28,000
It was like good for you and your
fucking at the top of your game.

5551
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:30,190
Everyone's scared of you and you're like,

5552
02:26:30,191 --> 02:26:30,581
man,

5553
02:26:30,581 --> 02:26:31,151
I'm good at those.

5554
02:26:31,151 --> 02:26:31,984
I mean like it,

5555
02:26:33,020 --> 02:26:34,540
I'm going into the weed business.

5556
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,470
Fuck yeah.

5557
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:35,920
Yeah.

5558
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:36,860
I mean rumble is a,

5559
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:38,020
he's a special person,

5560
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:40,570
but that kind of thing that he has,

5561
02:26:40,690 --> 02:26:42,820
he's got that one touch gift.

5562
02:26:42,880 --> 02:26:43,691
I mean for sure.

5563
02:26:43,691 --> 02:26:45,010
Technique for sure.

5564
02:26:45,130 --> 02:26:47,230
Years of training for sure.

5565
02:26:47,231 --> 02:26:49,750
Smart knows how to execute
and close the distance.

5566
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:52,090
There's a lot of excellent
variables on his side,

5567
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,380
but there's one thing that he possesses
that most human beings are never going

5568
02:26:56,381 --> 02:26:56,650
to get.

5569
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:57,580
No matter how they try.

5570
02:26:57,990 --> 02:26:59,320
They're not going to get that power.

5571
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:00,850
He's got that weird power.

5572
02:27:01,150 --> 02:27:02,380
There's a few people that just have their,

5573
02:27:02,381 --> 02:27:03,850
they got that weird power man,

5574
02:27:03,851 --> 02:27:08,620
that fat fast twitch muscle that gases
out quick or the slow twitch muscle like

5575
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:10,840
Nick Diaz that can push
and press the whole time.

5576
02:27:10,841 --> 02:27:11,290
It's like,

5577
02:27:11,290 --> 02:27:13,330
see Ryan and that always
gas up quick though.

5578
02:27:13,331 --> 02:27:15,160
Here's the thing he did in some fights,

5579
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:16,960
but if you watch the Phil Davis fight,

5580
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:18,510
he never gassed out for a second.

5581
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,180
That fight.

5582
02:27:19,180 --> 02:27:22,120
People forget who like
fucking filled Davis is good.

5583
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:25,210
He's real good and Womble put it to him.

5584
02:27:25,211 --> 02:27:29,860
Phil Davis was in survival mode and the
other guy about that survival mode son,

5585
02:27:29,890 --> 02:27:30,723
they'll gave it.

5586
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:32,623
Yeah man,

5587
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:33,281
he wasn't,

5588
02:27:33,281 --> 02:27:35,470
there was no wrestling
to be done in that fight.

5589
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:37,240
There's defense back to the feet,

5590
02:27:37,241 --> 02:27:38,074
keep ducking,

5591
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,270
keep ducking because
missiles are coming your way.

5592
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:43,570
Or if he's with like Henri Hooft at that
time was who've helped him that with

5593
02:27:43,571 --> 02:27:44,470
that for certain,

5594
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:44,831
I mean,

5595
02:27:44,831 --> 02:27:45,160
look,

5596
02:27:45,160 --> 02:27:50,020
but I really believe that all those
tough training camps and tough fights and

5597
02:27:50,021 --> 02:27:50,261
you know,

5598
02:27:50,261 --> 02:27:53,590
those battles that after a while he
just didn't want to do it anymore.

5599
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,700
Even if he's that good at it.

5600
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:55,990
He was one comfortable,

5601
02:27:55,991 --> 02:27:57,460
stressed out all the time,

5602
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:58,900
always get ready for a fight.

5603
02:27:59,140 --> 02:27:59,891
He didn't want to do it anymore.

5604
02:27:59,891 --> 02:28:00,724
He's a smart guy.

5605
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:01,450
Yeah.

5606
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:01,661
You know,

5607
02:28:01,661 --> 02:28:04,450
I think there's something
admirable about that,

5608
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:07,600
about him saying even though
he's on top of the heap,

5609
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:08,201
you know,

5610
02:28:08,201 --> 02:28:09,370
just lost the title.

5611
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:09,970
Right?

5612
02:28:09,970 --> 02:28:10,420
Yup.

5613
02:28:10,420 --> 02:28:11,111
Decides.

5614
02:28:11,111 --> 02:28:11,621
You know what?

5615
02:28:11,621 --> 02:28:12,430
Fuck it.

5616
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:13,263
I'm done.

5617
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:13,720
Well,

5618
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:14,720
he got beat twice.

5619
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:17,030
Maybe like you said,

5620
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:18,700
maybe do more like twice in a row.

5621
02:28:18,760 --> 02:28:19,593
He,

5622
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:20,201
yeah.

5623
02:28:20,201 --> 02:28:22,220
He one who did he beat in between?

5624
02:28:22,221 --> 02:28:22,431
No,

5625
02:28:22,431 --> 02:28:23,540
he beat a couple people.

5626
02:28:23,810 --> 02:28:24,920
I think he beat Glover.

5627
02:28:24,921 --> 02:28:26,540
He docked out clover in between.

5628
02:28:26,690 --> 02:28:27,523
That's right.

5629
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:27,891
Uh,

5630
02:28:27,891 --> 02:28:28,521
and then,

5631
02:28:28,521 --> 02:28:28,760
uh,

5632
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:29,390
who else did he,

5633
02:28:29,390 --> 02:28:30,650
she was fucking terrifying.

5634
02:28:30,700 --> 02:28:31,760
It was tallyman.

5635
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:35,510
But then he tried to make the lens
of 70 he did make like 70 many times.

5636
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:39,860
He used to fight at one 75 on tough
at one 70 at that high level too,

5637
02:28:39,861 --> 02:28:41,480
when there's so much on the line,

5638
02:28:41,481 --> 02:28:42,730
you get a fight 10 weeks out.

5639
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,041
Okay.

5640
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:47,120
Now every single day my thoughts are
filled with what's going to happen in that

5641
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:52,121
fight for 10 fucking weeks and it's
exhausting knowing that I might make this

5642
02:28:52,941 --> 02:28:54,860
much money or I might
make double that much.

5643
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:56,210
I can't plan ahead at all.

5644
02:28:56,240 --> 02:28:58,010
You've got to go based on
what happened in the fight.

5645
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,620
I'm not a big believer in that.

5646
02:29:00,680 --> 02:29:01,580
I don't like that.

5647
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:05,300
That's one part of the way people get
paid that I wish wasn't a tradition.

5648
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:07,400
The fight and then when bonus,

5649
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:10,780
I just feel like everybody's trying
to win and then the decisions.

5650
02:29:10,830 --> 02:29:11,060
Yeah,

5651
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:11,280
the,

5652
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:13,220
to see if it was one thing,

5653
02:29:13,370 --> 02:29:18,370
like if it was a rock solid decision
process where we did it all in a computer

5654
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:21,290
and everyone agreed and
everyone voted online.

5655
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:21,800
Yeah.

5656
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:23,150
Then okay.

5657
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:28,270
Because it might cost you $50,000 if
someone has a terrible idea of whether or

5658
02:29:29,241 --> 02:29:33,170
not you want to fight or not and sometimes
sometimes they're close and sometimes

5659
02:29:33,171 --> 02:29:35,960
they're subjective and sometimes it's
things that you might be looking for that

5660
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:38,990
might be you might think isn't good
enough to score and maybe you think the

5661
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:41,380
defense is just as important because
even though he took him down,

5662
02:29:41,390 --> 02:29:44,360
he didn't do anything and the guy on
the bottom was always working off of his

5663
02:29:44,361 --> 02:29:45,500
back or you're a boxer,

5664
02:29:45,501 --> 02:29:46,500
I'm a Jujitsu guy.

5665
02:29:46,710 --> 02:29:47,543
Like yeah,

5666
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:47,990
look,

5667
02:29:47,990 --> 02:29:49,280
there's always those things,

5668
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:51,890
but I think those could be
ironed out with a large,

5669
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:55,130
large enough sample group or a
large enough group of judges.

5670
02:29:55,160 --> 02:29:55,993
Like if we add,

5671
02:29:56,360 --> 02:29:57,280
why would you cage?

5672
02:29:57,480 --> 02:29:58,370
Why those three?

5673
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:58,851
What do we need?

5674
02:29:58,851 --> 02:29:59,684
Three,

5675
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:00,171
tell me.

5676
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:05,171
There's not thousands of people listening
to this right now that would make

5677
02:30:05,901 --> 02:30:07,940
phenomenal judges shit that,

5678
02:30:07,941 --> 02:30:09,260
no MMA,

5679
02:30:09,261 --> 02:30:10,760
that understand Jujitsu,

5680
02:30:10,761 --> 02:30:13,070
that no kickboxing all together.

5681
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:17,630
I mean there's got to be a fucking shit
ton of amount there that would do an

5682
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:19,940
amazing job if you let them do it online.

5683
02:30:20,330 --> 02:30:21,710
Let him watch it online,

5684
02:30:21,920 --> 02:30:23,080
let them judge it online,

5685
02:30:23,090 --> 02:30:24,710
have a little camera on
them while they do it.

5686
02:30:24,711 --> 02:30:26,240
So you know they're
actually watching the fight.

5687
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:27,440
Let them watch it.

5688
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:29,420
Don't just no commentary.

5689
02:30:29,421 --> 02:30:31,340
Just to let you know at
the sounds of the impacts,

5690
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:33,660
how about let's get a bunch
of people watching the show.

5691
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,690
What would it take to like
push an idea like that?

5692
02:30:35,691 --> 02:30:40,691
It's like we just used to Joe Louis
versus Max Schmeling that judge and judge

5693
02:30:42,580 --> 02:30:46,250
Walkley and judge Judy's
over and this job,

5694
02:30:46,251 --> 02:30:49,040
when we use this stupid old boxing system,

5695
02:30:49,430 --> 02:30:51,410
you know that system sucks.

5696
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:52,250
A Fat Dick.

5697
02:30:52,610 --> 02:30:56,510
They need to have a gang of people judging
fights because she'd be way more than

5698
02:30:56,511 --> 02:31:00,680
three and they should be super
educated in terms of like high level

5699
02:31:00,681 --> 02:31:03,440
understanding of
submission holds striking.

5700
02:31:03,650 --> 02:31:04,910
They should be able to demonstrate it.

5701
02:31:04,911 --> 02:31:06,110
What's more significant?

5702
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:09,980
An elbow to the top of the head or a
leg kick depends on who's throwing the

5703
02:31:09,981 --> 02:31:10,311
kick.

5704
02:31:10,311 --> 02:31:11,090
Depends on the stone,

5705
02:31:11,090 --> 02:31:11,750
the elbow,

5706
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:12,081
what's,

5707
02:31:12,081 --> 02:31:16,550
what's better a take down or take down
to lead you to get caught in a triangle

5708
02:31:16,551 --> 02:31:18,050
that you eventually survive in.

5709
02:31:18,051 --> 02:31:20,670
But you almost get tapped in and out.

5710
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:21,750
Did it not count?

5711
02:31:22,370 --> 02:31:25,680
What if a guy gets you really close to
a triangle and he's got you trapped in

5712
02:31:25,681 --> 02:31:26,011
there,

5713
02:31:26,011 --> 02:31:26,890
you try to slam on,

5714
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:29,910
he tightens it up more and there's a
battle and you're going back and forth and

5715
02:31:29,911 --> 02:31:32,850
back and forth and back and
forth and finally you get out.

5716
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,430
Do you get more credit
because you took him down?

5717
02:31:35,431 --> 02:31:37,290
Then he gets for almost strangling you.

5718
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:39,270
That's super subjective.

5719
02:31:39,510 --> 02:31:41,880
Super subjective and different
people would disagree.

5720
02:31:41,881 --> 02:31:42,810
They will argue over it.

5721
02:31:42,811 --> 02:31:47,811
I've seen really high level referees
and judges argue over what they think is

5722
02:31:47,911 --> 02:31:48,810
more important in better.

5723
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:51,180
It's so subjective and it's crazy,

5724
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:53,370
but I think if we had a giant number,

5725
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:53,671
man,

5726
02:31:53,671 --> 02:31:54,570
if we had a big number,

5727
02:31:54,571 --> 02:31:56,160
if you have a hundred people,

5728
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:58,190
I'm getting crazy idea.

5729
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:03,400
20 experts have a certified expert
panel and you have these people.

5730
02:32:04,591 --> 02:32:06,690
You give them access
to the fight for free.

5731
02:32:06,840 --> 02:32:08,370
You pay them a certain amount of money,

5732
02:32:08,371 --> 02:32:09,660
they get no commentary.

5733
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,450
They listened to the fight
play out in real time.

5734
02:32:12,451 --> 02:32:16,290
They have the options of tuning into
each corner or individual corners if they

5735
02:32:16,291 --> 02:32:16,621
want.

5736
02:32:16,621 --> 02:32:17,730
It's easy to arrange.

5737
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:22,820
We have that right now so if we decided
to do that and give that to someone who

5738
02:32:22,981 --> 02:32:27,981
calls at home who wants to not just watch
fights but is also an expert and would

5739
02:32:28,411 --> 02:32:31,830
love the idea of making 100 bucks
or whatever the fuck they pay.

5740
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:36,830
You have this camera prompt over their
head have have a online contributors and

5741
02:32:36,900 --> 02:32:37,260
nice.

5742
02:32:37,260 --> 02:32:41,250
Yeah and and maybe you know maybe
have fucking 10 people do it.

5743
02:32:41,251 --> 02:32:42,330
Maybe you have 20 people do it,

5744
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:47,480
but it doesn't in this day and age like
why would you not have more analysis

5745
02:32:48,460 --> 02:32:49,293
better than that.

5746
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:54,830
It's just not a good idea to throw
three unskilled people that their only

5747
02:32:55,351 --> 02:32:57,390
experiences watching
fights and judging them.

5748
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,580
Like literally they don't have
any martial arts experience.

5749
02:32:59,581 --> 02:33:00,900
That's a common theme.

5750
02:33:01,390 --> 02:33:01,930
Like there's,

5751
02:33:01,930 --> 02:33:04,350
it's high level.

5752
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,990
MMA fights are often,

5753
02:33:06,991 --> 02:33:10,830
the decisions are decided by people
that have zero martial arts experience,

5754
02:33:11,310 --> 02:33:12,540
which is crazy.

5755
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:15,990
It's like me judging a violin contest.

5756
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:17,381
It really is like,

5757
02:33:17,381 --> 02:33:19,530
I don't know a goddamn thing about,

5758
02:33:19,531 --> 02:33:20,850
I could get it totally wrong.

5759
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:22,950
I could get it totally wrong that people,

5760
02:33:22,951 --> 02:33:23,491
I would go,

5761
02:33:23,491 --> 02:33:24,600
oh I love the part we did that.

5762
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:25,650
Like that was a mistake.

5763
02:33:25,651 --> 02:33:28,500
You fucking is not supposed
to make that sound.

5764
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:30,350
That's why he should lose.

5765
02:33:30,351 --> 02:33:30,920
I'm like all,

5766
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:31,860
I thought that was cool.

5767
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:32,833
Yeah.

5768
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:36,960
That's how it is when a lot
of these people literally
don't have any idea what's

5769
02:33:36,961 --> 02:33:37,794
happening.

5770
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:40,830
I have a friend who was a judge who
told me wallow fight was going on.

5771
02:33:40,831 --> 02:33:43,650
This is many years ago
while a fight was going on,

5772
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:47,250
this guy was working for a Komora
and this lady who's a judge goes,

5773
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:48,510
what is he doing?

5774
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:50,010
What is he doing?

5775
02:33:50,010 --> 02:33:52,800
She says it to him cause she
needs to know cause she's,

5776
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:54,180
she's watching the fight.

5777
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:55,980
She doesn't know if that's a hold.

5778
02:33:56,100 --> 02:33:56,761
Like what is that?

5779
02:33:56,761 --> 02:33:57,540
Is this,

5780
02:33:57,540 --> 02:33:58,410
is this work?

5781
02:33:58,470 --> 02:33:59,100
Is this real?

5782
02:33:59,100 --> 02:34:03,690
And she's actually judging a fight
and he said I was flabbergasted.

5783
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:04,553
Fuck.

5784
02:34:04,620 --> 02:34:04,861
He goes,

5785
02:34:04,861 --> 02:34:07,020
she literally didn't
understand what was happening.

5786
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:09,990
She didn't know a Kamora
of like super common,

5787
02:34:10,170 --> 02:34:11,280
super common move.

5788
02:34:11,281 --> 02:34:12,114
She didn't know it.

5789
02:34:12,330 --> 02:34:12,900
Death crazy.

5790
02:34:12,900 --> 02:34:15,120
Did you listen to the commentary
at all in sugar spike?

5791
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:16,960
I don't think so.

5792
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,793
Oh fuck.

5793
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,580
Which fight?

5794
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:19,360
Andre?

5795
02:34:19,360 --> 02:34:21,760
He was whining about meats and stuff.

5796
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:22,541
Oh,

5797
02:34:22,541 --> 02:34:23,470
in between corners?

5798
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:24,131
No,

5799
02:34:24,131 --> 02:34:25,060
it was during the fight.

5800
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:28,360
I was just jabbering that Andre a little
bit just cause I knew that that big

5801
02:34:28,361 --> 02:34:33,361
pressure moment he was feeling that I
was just laughing when he missed or just

5802
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:36,130
little things and make fun
of them are a little bit,

5803
02:34:36,131 --> 02:34:38,440
cause I know he was thinking
about it and I know that,

5804
02:34:38,470 --> 02:34:39,460
do you know him well?

5805
02:34:39,490 --> 02:34:39,910
No,

5806
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:42,190
but I could see the pressure
of the buildup of him all week.

5807
02:34:42,191 --> 02:34:43,390
He was getting super emotional,

5808
02:34:43,391 --> 02:34:46,780
so I knew that little extra push
we'd get him emotional teamwork.

5809
02:34:46,990 --> 02:34:48,790
And then after he tweeted,

5810
02:34:48,791 --> 02:34:49,624
he's like,

5811
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:52,780
all I could hear is it's fucking corner
talking shit to me the whole time.

5812
02:34:52,781 --> 02:34:53,620
And that's all I could like,

5813
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:54,610
wow.

5814
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:55,330
I'm like,

5815
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:57,430
I know at the high high
level it's not going to work,

5816
02:34:57,431 --> 02:34:59,290
but I just feel it's another tactic.

5817
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:00,461
Yeah,

5818
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:00,910
right.

5819
02:35:00,910 --> 02:35:02,670
I mean maybe it will like who would,

5820
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:03,580
who would it work on?

5821
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:07,240
We'll just say like these guys or these
guys are UFC fighters and their town.

5822
02:35:07,241 --> 02:35:09,100
Everyone respects them
and treats them nice.

5823
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:11,770
And then all of a sudden you're in this
place where two guys are talking shit to

5824
02:35:11,771 --> 02:35:14,290
you and then you're fighting one and
he's laughing at you in this and they're

5825
02:35:14,291 --> 02:35:14,770
like,

5826
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:15,491
oh fuck.

5827
02:35:15,491 --> 02:35:16,450
I'm not used to this.

5828
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:17,860
It's just another tactic.

5829
02:35:17,861 --> 02:35:19,900
But I know at a certain
level it won't work.

5830
02:35:19,901 --> 02:35:20,734
But why not?

5831
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:22,661
Certain level?

5832
02:35:22,661 --> 02:35:23,860
It might work a little though.

5833
02:35:24,310 --> 02:35:25,120
It's just another.

5834
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:25,540
Yeah.

5835
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:29,230
And I want people just want people
fucking trying to hit sugar hearts and

5836
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:29,651
they're stiff.

5837
02:35:29,651 --> 02:35:31,120
So he's waxing them as they come in.

5838
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:32,430
Well,

5839
02:35:32,430 --> 02:35:34,020
definitely don't talk
about it on the Internet.

5840
02:35:34,021 --> 02:35:36,120
If you want it to have it still happen.

5841
02:35:36,630 --> 02:35:37,463
It still happens.

5842
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:38,431
I'm sure.

5843
02:35:38,431 --> 02:35:39,540
I'm just saying give it up.

5844
02:35:39,541 --> 02:35:41,890
Your strategy son believes in it though.

5845
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:42,780
I trust it.

5846
02:35:42,780 --> 02:35:43,830
I believe you believe in it.

5847
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:46,620
You definitely a fast learner man.

5848
02:35:46,710 --> 02:35:47,370
You know,

5849
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:48,240
it's uh,

5850
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:50,240
it's interesting how you have a,

5851
02:35:50,241 --> 02:35:54,330
a style of moving and throwing kicks
that I would have assumed that you have

5852
02:35:54,331 --> 02:35:59,331
like a long background in some sort of
traditional martial arts or karate or

5853
02:36:00,630 --> 02:36:02,700
taekwondo or something because
the way you thrown kicks,

5854
02:36:02,701 --> 02:36:04,340
I was like the sky like the way,

5855
02:36:04,410 --> 02:36:07,140
but I guess that's like a lot of
also your emulation of Connor,

5856
02:36:07,141 --> 02:36:09,570
right style.

5857
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:10,361
Yeah,

5858
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:10,840
I was,

5859
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:12,220
I was kind of doing that before,

5860
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:15,130
before I saw Connor just
kinda throwing weird kicks.

5861
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:18,910
I remember being at the lab and
watching videos and trying them,

5862
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:21,070
just teaching myself then.

5863
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:24,700
But as far as my movement
that I played basketball,

5864
02:36:24,701 --> 02:36:25,091
football,

5865
02:36:25,091 --> 02:36:29,230
soccer and baseball my entire life since
I was four until I was in high school,

5866
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:32,860
I think I was just became a math super
athletic from doing so many different

5867
02:36:32,861 --> 02:36:33,694
sports.

5868
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:35,650
And then I added that to fighting and

5869
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:38,103
I don't know.

5870
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:38,910
It works well.

5871
02:36:38,910 --> 02:36:39,060
Well,

5872
02:36:39,060 --> 02:36:39,940
your length too,

5873
02:36:39,941 --> 02:36:40,181
man,

5874
02:36:40,181 --> 02:36:41,410
that's a big factor.

5875
02:36:41,620 --> 02:36:43,570
That's like a six four guy at one 70.

5876
02:36:43,720 --> 02:36:44,920
That's switching stances.

5877
02:36:45,910 --> 02:36:50,910
Five ten five 11 five 11 five
10 for one 35 is so crazy.

5878
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:52,220
Yeah,

5879
02:36:52,220 --> 02:36:53,053
there's some,

5880
02:36:53,090 --> 02:36:53,360
there's some,

5881
02:36:53,360 --> 02:36:54,280
as you walk around,

5882
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:57,370
wait one 51 and put it
in your arms real quick.

5883
02:36:57,380 --> 02:37:01,720
Like I fucking long his stretches for
30 for 35 like how hard is it for you to

5884
02:37:01,721 --> 02:37:03,370
get down to 35 super easy.

5885
02:37:03,371 --> 02:37:03,881
Super easy.

5886
02:37:03,881 --> 02:37:04,300
Yeah.

5887
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:05,950
What do you think about this recent move?

5888
02:37:05,951 --> 02:37:09,040
A Dana white has just said that he's
going to eliminate the early weight cuts.

5889
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:09,530
Is that really?

5890
02:37:09,530 --> 02:37:11,440
I hope that that would be the worst thing.

5891
02:37:12,400 --> 02:37:13,820
That's so stupid.

5892
02:37:13,821 --> 02:37:16,190
And you said too many people are missing
the weight and they're trying to gain

5893
02:37:16,191 --> 02:37:19,700
the system and they're trying to cut more
because they know that have more time

5894
02:37:19,701 --> 02:37:20,534
to recover.

5895
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:21,400
Yeah,

5896
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:22,233
I would a huge,

5897
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:23,150
I love the,

5898
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:23,660
the night.

5899
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,411
It's easy.

5900
02:37:24,411 --> 02:37:24,920
Thank you.

5901
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:26,720
Fucking still know what time Wayne's are.

5902
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:31,430
Do you think it's possible that they
could ever eliminate weight cutting

5903
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:32,060
entirely?

5904
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:32,810
I hope so.

5905
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:33,643
I would love that.

5906
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:34,970
I would love that.

5907
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:35,630
I don't know.

5908
02:37:35,630 --> 02:37:36,220
I just,

5909
02:37:36,220 --> 02:37:36,440
yeah,

5910
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:39,440
find out what your actual
weight is and fight it.

5911
02:37:39,441 --> 02:37:39,980
That,

5912
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:41,120
I mean if you're too muscular,

5913
02:37:41,121 --> 02:37:41,840
loose weight,

5914
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:42,630
if you're too fat,

5915
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:43,463
there's some fat,

5916
02:37:44,090 --> 02:37:46,340
but find out what weight
you're at and just,

5917
02:37:46,970 --> 02:37:49,230
I think that's an unnecessary danger.

5918
02:37:49,610 --> 02:37:50,750
That's the Nice thing about Shaun.

5919
02:37:50,751 --> 02:37:52,580
He's not a huge one 35 or so weeks.

5920
02:37:52,610 --> 02:37:56,510
We don't have to eat to get huge like
George said or eat to really dial it down.

5921
02:37:56,511 --> 02:38:00,770
We can eat to where he just performs the
best and just stay there and then maybe

5922
02:38:00,771 --> 02:38:01,970
have to cut eight pounds,

5923
02:38:02,480 --> 02:38:04,190
eat normal the whole week,

5924
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:07,740
drink normal the whole week and
then go in there feeling 100% yeah,

5925
02:38:07,741 --> 02:38:08,240
it's just,

5926
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,400
it's an unnecessary aspect.

5927
02:38:10,400 --> 02:38:14,390
And I think one of the things that would
be a solution is give guys more options

5928
02:38:14,391 --> 02:38:18,620
of what weight to actually fight at when
there's these big giant gaps in between

5929
02:38:18,621 --> 02:38:19,460
weight classes.

5930
02:38:19,700 --> 02:38:22,280
It forces people in a lot
of ways to cut weight.

5931
02:38:22,310 --> 02:38:26,450
Cause like maybe they're just too small
for one 85 but they can make one 70 so

5932
02:38:26,451 --> 02:38:26,811
fuck it.

5933
02:38:26,811 --> 02:38:30,710
I'll just make one 70 because I
know how big x guy is or why guys.

5934
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:33,080
Cause you know some of those 85 man,

5935
02:38:33,081 --> 02:38:33,681
you're around them.

5936
02:38:33,681 --> 02:38:35,630
You're like Ho Lee Shit.

5937
02:38:35,640 --> 02:38:35,961
Fuck.

5938
02:38:35,961 --> 02:38:37,310
This is a fucking heavyweight.

5939
02:38:37,311 --> 02:38:37,990
Hale.

5940
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:40,250
Geez Hales big fella.

5941
02:38:40,850 --> 02:38:41,780
There's a lot of them.

5942
02:38:41,781 --> 02:38:44,360
Luke Rockhold is a big hazy fella.

5943
02:38:44,450 --> 02:38:45,410
He's big,

5944
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:48,800
he's big and strong as fuck.

5945
02:38:48,801 --> 02:38:53,801
And you know he weighs one 85 so if
you're in that guy's way class like good

5946
02:38:54,021 --> 02:38:54,441
luck.

5947
02:38:54,441 --> 02:38:55,274
Fuck face.

5948
02:38:56,480 --> 02:38:58,550
How about Yo Al Romero?

5949
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:03,730
Yo and row is one 85 are
you fucking kidding me dude?

5950
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:09,260
He's one of the most impressive physical
specimens I've ever been in front of.

5951
02:39:09,620 --> 02:39:10,910
I mean phenomenal wrestler,

5952
02:39:10,911 --> 02:39:11,730
talented fighter,

5953
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:12,351
all of the above.

5954
02:39:12,351 --> 02:39:14,060
But just his physique.

5955
02:39:14,480 --> 02:39:16,880
Like he just looks like a superhero.

5956
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:18,350
He doesn't look like a real person.

5957
02:39:18,980 --> 02:39:21,230
Have you been around him in
real life to flex your traps?

5958
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:22,590
You look like Yo el a little bit.

5959
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:23,660
Okay,

5960
02:39:23,660 --> 02:39:24,261
well dude,

5961
02:39:24,261 --> 02:39:29,000
he was here in that shirt in that seat
and he was wearing this tight shirt with

5962
02:39:29,001 --> 02:39:33,530
like a gold cross and shit and you know
it's skin tight and you look at it and

5963
02:39:33,531 --> 02:39:33,711
be like,

5964
02:39:33,711 --> 02:39:37,670
well an in between fights and he's not
trying to make one 85 he's well over 200

5965
02:39:37,671 --> 02:39:38,380
pounds.

5966
02:39:38,380 --> 02:39:40,740
He's fucking jacket.

5967
02:39:41,490 --> 02:39:44,300
He's got that Super Cuban DNA son theory.

5968
02:39:44,570 --> 02:39:47,460
I wonder what DC is going to way
going into fight with Steve Bay

5969
02:39:50,810 --> 02:39:53,910
jacked Yo Romero is jack

5970
02:39:55,970 --> 02:39:58,280
could not be a nicer guy.

5971
02:39:59,690 --> 02:40:00,560
Be a nicer,

5972
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:01,180
that's cool.

5973
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:01,550
He was,

5974
02:40:01,550 --> 02:40:02,450
he's beautiful.

5975
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:07,540
He's like that might be funny
and friendly and he's a sweet,

5976
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:08,421
sweet guy.

5977
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:10,100
He's laughing all the time.

5978
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:12,170
He's so happy to not be in Cuba.

5979
02:40:12,350 --> 02:40:13,980
And when he talks you about Cuba,

5980
02:40:13,981 --> 02:40:14,791
like he's explaining,

5981
02:40:14,791 --> 02:40:16,230
you know like he can go back to Cuba.

5982
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:19,500
He's one of the few guys that can go
back to Cuba and then leave and come back

5983
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:20,180
to the United States.

5984
02:40:20,180 --> 02:40:20,620
Yeah,

5985
02:40:20,620 --> 02:40:21,210
yeah.

5986
02:40:21,210 --> 02:40:22,050
It says it's crazy.

5987
02:40:22,051 --> 02:40:22,321
He says,

5988
02:40:22,321 --> 02:40:25,110
you got to keep your mouth shut
and move around and you know,

5989
02:40:25,111 --> 02:40:29,310
watch what you say and don't piss anybody
off cause they all want to leave and

5990
02:40:29,311 --> 02:40:32,680
they can't leave and you can leave and
come back and leave and come back for

5991
02:40:32,850 --> 02:40:33,683
raising.

5992
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:36,770
It's weird like usually someone
who's super fucking Badass,

5993
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:38,100
they're always really nice.

5994
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:39,630
He's so nice.

5995
02:40:40,020 --> 02:40:41,670
Soldier of God does that as t shirt.

5996
02:40:42,280 --> 02:40:43,110
I love you.

5997
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:44,080
I love you.

5998
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:49,290
Oh,

5999
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:53,340
oh we need an account and ordered me that.

6000
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:56,100
Then I'll take that in the large please.

6001
02:40:57,060 --> 02:40:57,900
That's awesome.

6002
02:40:58,530 --> 02:40:59,311
That's a dope one.

6003
02:40:59,311 --> 02:40:59,461
Yeah.

6004
02:40:59,461 --> 02:41:00,690
They're coming out with funny shit.

6005
02:41:00,691 --> 02:41:02,340
You know this is yours,

6006
02:41:02,341 --> 02:41:02,660
right?

6007
02:41:02,660 --> 02:41:03,390
Yeah,

6008
02:41:03,390 --> 02:41:07,710
it's sold out the first like couple of
hours on the rebbe on a couple different

6009
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:08,544
websites.

6010
02:41:08,910 --> 02:41:10,050
They just got it back in stock.

6011
02:41:10,051 --> 02:41:10,511
I would come on,

6012
02:41:10,511 --> 02:41:11,250
sorry bar.

6013
02:41:11,250 --> 02:41:11,541
Come on.

6014
02:41:11,541 --> 02:41:12,331
So it was beautiful.

6015
02:41:12,331 --> 02:41:15,270
They had a marijuana leaf behind
that at first and it was so sweet.

6016
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:16,350
They had to get rid of the marijuana.

6017
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:17,723
Yeah,

6018
02:41:17,870 --> 02:41:18,420
that's it.

6019
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:21,900
I I I imagine they need to let it go
in this day and age you let it go.

6020
02:41:22,050 --> 02:41:22,650
It was a rest.

6021
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:26,280
They weren't willing to think of how many
people told you not promote marijuana

6022
02:41:26,281 --> 02:41:30,900
at the UFC will not
ever sign you back then?

6023
02:41:30,901 --> 02:41:31,530
Maybe,

6024
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:32,363
but not anymore.

6025
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:33,450
Like couple of years ago,

6026
02:41:33,470 --> 02:41:35,730
Sean is like the first
day be open about it.

6027
02:41:35,990 --> 02:41:36,420
Um,

6028
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:37,350
is that True Nick Diaz?

6029
02:41:37,380 --> 02:41:37,681
Come on.

6030
02:41:37,681 --> 02:41:38,640
So I guess that's true.

6031
02:41:39,340 --> 02:41:39,760
Um,

6032
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,560
Nick Diaz has always been a black hawk.

6033
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:41,761
Yeah,

6034
02:41:41,761 --> 02:41:42,300
that's true.

6035
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:43,133
Open as fuck.

6036
02:41:44,550 --> 02:41:45,870
People are open about weed.

6037
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:47,820
It's more behind the scenes.

6038
02:41:47,821 --> 02:41:49,080
Well Dana doesn't give a fuck.

6039
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:52,320
The only thing that they care about
is commissions and people you know,

6040
02:41:52,321 --> 02:41:53,490
failing the test,

6041
02:41:53,491 --> 02:41:54,930
which they think it's
stupid in the first place,

6042
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:56,250
then it doesn't give a fuck.

6043
02:41:56,251 --> 02:41:56,911
People smoke weed.

6044
02:41:56,911 --> 02:41:57,421
If there were like there,

6045
02:41:57,421 --> 02:41:57,751
he's right.

6046
02:41:57,751 --> 02:41:59,070
He'd rather have him smoke weed.

6047
02:41:59,071 --> 02:41:59,850
I'm sure.

6048
02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:01,980
Especially now that it's legal then drink.

6049
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:02,933
But 10 years ago,

6050
02:42:03,130 --> 02:42:04,560
what was he like five years ago?

6051
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:06,120
It's all about the commissions.

6052
02:42:06,121 --> 02:42:06,841
He's a promoter.

6053
02:42:06,841 --> 02:42:10,200
He's not a guy who interferes
with people's Personal
Pottsville cause he doesn't

6054
02:42:10,201 --> 02:42:10,441
like it.

6055
02:42:10,441 --> 02:42:12,180
Same moral in my company we're gonna.

6056
02:42:12,270 --> 02:42:12,870
Yeah,

6057
02:42:12,870 --> 02:42:13,630
none of that.

6058
02:42:13,630 --> 02:42:14,190
He just,

6059
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:17,310
his opinion is based entirely on
the fact you're going to get tested.

6060
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:19,590
So if you're smoking pot,

6061
02:42:19,591 --> 02:42:23,940
you can't stop and you're six weeks out
and you know you fucking pass that limit

6062
02:42:23,941 --> 02:42:27,420
because there used to be pleased to be
looking for a very small amount and you

6063
02:42:27,421 --> 02:42:27,610
would,

6064
02:42:27,610 --> 02:42:30,270
you would need a good solid four
to six weeks to flush your system.

6065
02:42:30,510 --> 02:42:32,370
And some guys would j they push it,

6066
02:42:32,371 --> 02:42:33,204
they get into three,

6067
02:42:33,210 --> 02:42:36,690
they get into three weeks and just drink
a lot of fucking water and apple cider

6068
02:42:36,691 --> 02:42:39,990
vinegar and tried to clean their system
out and sometimes it would work and

6069
02:42:39,991 --> 02:42:42,990
sometimes you would deal with a really
sophisticated commission and they would

6070
02:42:42,991 --> 02:42:43,530
catch you.

6071
02:42:43,530 --> 02:42:44,101
Pat Heeley,

6072
02:42:44,101 --> 02:42:46,710
Jim Miller when pat one
both bonuses that night,

6073
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:47,880
130 gs.

6074
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:48,640
That's right.

6075
02:42:48,640 --> 02:42:49,770
Tested positive for pot,

6076
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:53,790
got a hundred case bonus away and the
Wynn and his wind bone and is when,

6077
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:54,301
I mean look,

6078
02:42:54,301 --> 02:42:55,550
do you think the pod helped him win?

6079
02:42:55,570 --> 02:42:56,510
Get the fuck Outta here.

6080
02:42:56,530 --> 02:42:57,060
Shit.

6081
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:57,541
It's crazy.

6082
02:42:57,541 --> 02:42:58,680
And it was just a little amount.

6083
02:42:59,730 --> 02:43:00,450
He pushed it,

6084
02:43:00,450 --> 02:43:00,900
you know,

6085
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:01,171
I mean,

6086
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:03,870
and pat is a guy that fights
like a fucking savage,

6087
02:43:03,990 --> 02:43:04,411
so you know,

6088
02:43:04,411 --> 02:43:05,610
he trains like that too.

6089
02:43:05,611 --> 02:43:07,530
So it's all just fucking crying,

6090
02:43:07,531 --> 02:43:08,760
going and smashing.

6091
02:43:08,761 --> 02:43:10,770
And so he's probably sore all the time,

6092
02:43:10,771 --> 02:43:11,210
man.

6093
02:43:11,210 --> 02:43:11,400
Yeah.

6094
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:12,190
You know,

6095
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:12,581
if you're,

6096
02:43:12,581 --> 02:43:15,100
if you fight that fucking wrestler,

6097
02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:15,540
uh,

6098
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:16,590
the top games,

6099
02:43:16,591 --> 02:43:18,580
smash them up style like he does.

6100
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:19,433
Yup.

6101
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:20,650
And that grit style,

6102
02:43:20,651 --> 02:43:22,240
he's got that put it to you.

6103
02:43:22,570 --> 02:43:25,300
Just keep that pressure
on youtube break style.

6104
02:43:25,660 --> 02:43:27,040
Those guys get sore as fuck,

6105
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:27,281
man.

6106
02:43:27,281 --> 02:43:28,150
They need some pot.

6107
02:43:28,270 --> 02:43:30,130
Calm him down for sure.

6108
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:32,370
We're going to look back on it someday.

6109
02:43:32,440 --> 02:43:33,760
It's going to be ridiculous.

6110
02:43:34,210 --> 02:43:36,670
We're going to look back on the fact
that pot was illegal when we're kids,

6111
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:37,331
we're going to be like,

6112
02:43:37,331 --> 02:43:39,160
how in the fuck is that possible?

6113
02:43:39,490 --> 02:43:41,440
Some people take it to
their graves though.

6114
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:43,540
We'd the day my mom,

6115
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:45,700
they just don't get it.

6116
02:43:45,950 --> 02:43:46,350
It's,

6117
02:43:46,350 --> 02:43:47,410
it's not their fault.

6118
02:43:47,460 --> 02:43:47,770
It's,

6119
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:48,603
here's the thing,

6120
02:43:48,850 --> 02:43:50,860
weeds the devil for some people,

6121
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:53,770
but alcohol's the devil for some people,

6122
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:54,281
you know,

6123
02:43:54,281 --> 02:43:57,400
gambling's the devil for some
people jerking off as the devil.

6124
02:43:57,401 --> 02:43:58,234
For some people.

6125
02:43:58,550 --> 02:43:59,370
There's people that get,

6126
02:43:59,370 --> 02:44:03,490
they get caught up in all kinds of
shit because people are fucked up.

6127
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:04,510
We're weird,

6128
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:05,561
you know,

6129
02:44:05,561 --> 02:44:06,011
but it's not,

6130
02:44:06,011 --> 02:44:06,690
the pot.

6131
02:44:06,690 --> 02:44:07,780
Pot is not the problem.

6132
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:10,390
You throwing out the
baby with the bath water.

6133
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:11,800
This shit is good for people.

6134
02:44:11,801 --> 02:44:12,634
It helps you.

6135
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:14,440
It makes you think more.

6136
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:16,780
It opens your eyes to weird things.

6137
02:44:16,781 --> 02:44:17,600
It makes you,

6138
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:19,150
it makes you nicer to people.

6139
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:20,020
Yeah,

6140
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:20,853
it really does.

6141
02:44:21,130 --> 02:44:21,311
Oh,

6142
02:44:21,311 --> 02:44:22,144
for sure.

6143
02:44:22,210 --> 02:44:22,750
Yeah,

6144
02:44:22,750 --> 02:44:23,171
for sure.

6145
02:44:23,171 --> 02:44:24,004
Right.

6146
02:44:24,760 --> 02:44:26,710
Makes you just get my
mom to take one puff,

6147
02:44:27,270 --> 02:44:27,850
a little puff.

6148
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:29,400
Just still the big do it.

6149
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:30,513
What about edibles?

6150
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:31,720
No,

6151
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:32,553
no way.

6152
02:44:33,930 --> 02:44:34,763
Yes.

6153
02:44:35,790 --> 02:44:36,670
One of the camp six,

6154
02:44:36,671 --> 02:44:37,330
seven,

6155
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:38,163
eight weeks out.

6156
02:44:38,470 --> 02:44:39,300
I pretty much,

6157
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:39,490
I've,

6158
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:42,520
I've only vaporized and use edibles and
then once I start getting to that three,

6159
02:44:42,530 --> 02:44:43,031
four weeks,

6160
02:44:43,031 --> 02:44:44,140
I'm only do edibles

6161
02:44:46,370 --> 02:44:46,870
right here.

6162
02:44:46,870 --> 02:44:47,980
We don't have any jam here.

6163
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:50,290
I got to get you this Jambo spray.

6164
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:50,930
Oh,

6165
02:44:50,930 --> 02:44:51,763
change your life.

6166
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:52,673
The spray.

6167
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:53,993
Oh yeah,

6168
02:44:54,390 --> 02:44:55,270
but be careful.

6169
02:44:55,750 --> 02:44:56,910
I have this liquid.

6170
02:44:56,911 --> 02:44:58,660
It's the liquid you
pour under your tongue.

6171
02:44:58,720 --> 02:44:59,820
That's right.

6172
02:44:59,821 --> 02:44:59,990
Yeah.

6173
02:44:59,990 --> 02:45:00,450
Be careful.

6174
02:45:00,450 --> 02:45:01,283
That's like acid.

6175
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:03,580
I ain't going people with those.

6176
02:45:03,581 --> 02:45:06,820
Dabbers all those wacky people
with the wax too heavy for me.

6177
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:07,870
Go Fuck yourself folks.

6178
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:09,160
Be going too far.

6179
02:45:09,530 --> 02:45:10,080
They're out.

6180
02:45:10,080 --> 02:45:11,300
They're out in the land of no.

6181
02:45:11,301 --> 02:45:11,710
Those like,

6182
02:45:11,710 --> 02:45:15,970
that's like the marijuana equivalent
of those people that take that Krokodil

6183
02:45:15,971 --> 02:45:16,804
drug.

6184
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:19,600
You know those people that take that shit,

6185
02:45:19,601 --> 02:45:20,160
that rots.

6186
02:45:20,160 --> 02:45:24,760
You ever seen that Krokodil with some
drug that was in fact affecting a lot of

6187
02:45:24,761 --> 02:45:25,571
people apparently.

6188
02:45:25,571 --> 02:45:26,404
And um,

6189
02:45:26,890 --> 02:45:29,320
was it eastern bloc states?

6190
02:45:30,300 --> 02:45:31,133
Russia?

6191
02:45:31,750 --> 02:45:32,583
I think it was Russia,

6192
02:45:33,070 --> 02:45:37,510
but it rots your skin away to the
point where your bones exposed.

6193
02:45:37,840 --> 02:45:41,590
Since people would shoot it right into
the spot where they're bone was exposed.

6194
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:43,510
Like that's how crazy this drug.

6195
02:45:43,511 --> 02:45:44,650
If it's so,

6196
02:45:44,860 --> 02:45:47,710
it's so powerful and so
crazy and feel so good,

6197
02:45:47,860 --> 02:45:49,990
they shoot it right into the rotten meat.

6198
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:52,210
What would their exposed bone,

6199
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:52,661
oh,

6200
02:45:52,661 --> 02:45:54,280
this photo's man all over the Internet.

6201
02:45:54,281 --> 02:45:56,280
It will freak you out in Colombia,

6202
02:45:56,750 --> 02:45:57,700
Colombia.

6203
02:45:58,170 --> 02:45:58,420
Uh,

6204
02:45:58,420 --> 02:45:59,253
that's where it is.

6205
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,123
This one artist.

6206
02:46:00,130 --> 02:46:00,830
Okay.

6207
02:46:00,830 --> 02:46:02,050
Is there one from Russia?

6208
02:46:02,890 --> 02:46:06,610
I feel like there was a
theme about Russian kids that
were shooting Krokodil and

6209
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:08,170
this burnt out warehouse.

6210
02:46:08,171 --> 02:46:08,621
It was like,

6211
02:46:08,621 --> 02:46:09,830
what the fuck?

6212
02:46:09,831 --> 02:46:10,520
Damn.

6213
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:11,121
Fuck Dude.

6214
02:46:11,121 --> 02:46:12,410
It's heart pumps and photos,

6215
02:46:12,411 --> 02:46:12,860
son.

6216
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:13,693
Don't talk.

6217
02:46:13,700 --> 02:46:15,410
Gross us out from a distance.

6218
02:46:15,570 --> 02:46:16,100
Look at that.

6219
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:16,933
That's real.

6220
02:46:17,070 --> 02:46:19,370
So that lady shooting
that stuff into her arm,

6221
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:20,720
the meat rotted away.

6222
02:46:20,840 --> 02:46:22,520
Her bone is exposed.

6223
02:46:22,670 --> 02:46:23,570
She can't help it.

6224
02:46:23,571 --> 02:46:24,110
Man.

6225
02:46:24,110 --> 02:46:25,190
That stuff just starts.

6226
02:46:25,220 --> 02:46:29,810
It starts rotting their flesh away
and a lot of people wind up like this,

6227
02:46:29,811 --> 02:46:30,021
man,

6228
02:46:30,021 --> 02:46:30,854
look at this lady.

6229
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:31,693
Look at her arm.

6230
02:46:31,720 --> 02:46:32,600
Who got her forearm?

6231
02:46:32,630 --> 02:46:33,463
Krokodil.

6232
02:46:33,470 --> 02:46:33,830
Yeah,

6233
02:46:33,830 --> 02:46:34,191
look at it.

6234
02:46:34,191 --> 02:46:35,240
Ate Away or forum,

6235
02:46:35,241 --> 02:46:35,720
man,

6236
02:46:35,720 --> 02:46:37,850
there's almost nothing
left of her forearm.

6237
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:41,360
This is a really common thing
that you could find online.

6238
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:42,530
If you want to throw up,

6239
02:46:42,770 --> 02:46:43,700
look at that guy's foot.

6240
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:45,170
It just [inaudible].

6241
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:46,881
I don't know,

6242
02:46:46,881 --> 02:46:47,151
man.

6243
02:46:47,151 --> 02:46:48,320
I'm too scared to ask.

6244
02:46:48,350 --> 02:46:48,951
I don't even,

6245
02:46:48,951 --> 02:46:49,820
to me that one hand,

6246
02:46:49,821 --> 02:46:50,361
click on that here.

6247
02:46:50,361 --> 02:46:51,194
Where your cursor's on.

6248
02:46:51,850 --> 02:46:52,430
Click on that.

6249
02:46:52,430 --> 02:46:53,510
Oh Jesus.

6250
02:46:56,220 --> 02:46:56,750
Look at this.

6251
02:46:56,750 --> 02:46:57,940
Look at this person.

6252
02:46:57,950 --> 02:47:00,360
Squirting it into their leg toward God.

6253
02:47:00,590 --> 02:47:02,270
Jesus Christ.

6254
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:03,261
Oh my God.

6255
02:47:03,261 --> 02:47:04,410
It's eaten that person's ass.

6256
02:47:04,430 --> 02:47:04,641
All right,

6257
02:47:04,641 --> 02:47:06,950
that's enough.

6258
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:09,070
Thank you for not showing these online.

6259
02:47:09,380 --> 02:47:11,660
People just get so fucking damaged.

6260
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:12,071
What?

6261
02:47:12,071 --> 02:47:17,071
What is that drug that makes it like
imagine itch that's so hard to not scratch

6262
02:47:17,661 --> 02:47:18,050
that you'll,

6263
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:19,570
you're willing to shoot the drugs.

6264
02:47:19,571 --> 02:47:21,860
She's into the hole where the bone is.

6265
02:47:22,560 --> 02:47:23,393
Fuck,

6266
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:25,430
people are fucked up,

6267
02:47:25,431 --> 02:47:26,030
man.

6268
02:47:26,030 --> 02:47:28,370
People are fucked up and
a lot of it's this weird,

6269
02:47:28,371 --> 02:47:29,750
like they were saying in this,

6270
02:47:29,751 --> 02:47:29,990
uh,

6271
02:47:29,990 --> 02:47:31,430
podcast from zero to three.

6272
02:47:31,431 --> 02:47:33,650
You learn more than you'll
ever learn in your whole life.

6273
02:47:33,700 --> 02:47:35,360
And we don't even remember that.

6274
02:47:35,361 --> 02:47:36,230
Like when people say that,

6275
02:47:36,231 --> 02:47:36,441
I go,

6276
02:47:36,441 --> 02:47:37,274
maybe you bro.

6277
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:38,773
I really,

6278
02:47:39,350 --> 02:47:43,130
I thought pattern like 10
times stronger than heroin.

6279
02:47:44,150 --> 02:47:45,440
Three times more toxic.

6280
02:47:45,680 --> 02:47:46,513
Jesus.

6281
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:49,220
It's a 10th of the price.

6282
02:47:49,350 --> 02:47:49,970
Oh,

6283
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:50,510
that's the problem.

6284
02:47:50,510 --> 02:47:51,080
It's a bar.

6285
02:47:51,080 --> 02:47:51,913
It's Costco.

6286
02:47:52,100 --> 02:47:52,933
Costco drug.

6287
02:47:53,150 --> 02:47:56,300
So what were we're saying that you learn
more by the time you're three zero from

6288
02:47:56,301 --> 02:47:57,380
zero to three,

6289
02:47:57,470 --> 02:48:00,770
then you'll ever learn in your life
taking in more information about like

6290
02:48:01,290 --> 02:48:02,123
everything.

6291
02:48:02,520 --> 02:48:03,050
Huh?

6292
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:04,660
Just being programmed from that like,

6293
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:06,290
and we don't even remember that.

6294
02:48:06,291 --> 02:48:08,690
And that forms maybe a lot of
patterns that are brains now.

6295
02:48:08,691 --> 02:48:09,140
Like,

6296
02:48:09,140 --> 02:48:09,351
oh,

6297
02:48:09,351 --> 02:48:10,051
for sure.

6298
02:48:10,051 --> 02:48:10,880
Idea.

6299
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,031
Oh,

6300
02:48:11,031 --> 02:48:11,864
for sure.

6301
02:48:12,130 --> 02:48:12,540
Um,

6302
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:15,170
especially if a kids grow around,

6303
02:48:15,380 --> 02:48:16,580
grew up around violence,

6304
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:17,960
violence in the house,

6305
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:19,100
violence in their community.

6306
02:48:19,520 --> 02:48:19,880
Uh,

6307
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:22,400
especially even if their mom
was going through violence,

6308
02:48:22,401 --> 02:48:23,330
whether in the womb,

6309
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:23,721
that's it,

6310
02:48:23,721 --> 02:48:27,200
that has a giant factor in the way you
connect the dots and the way you interact

6311
02:48:27,201 --> 02:48:28,034
with people.

6312
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:32,780
I was on a plane once headed to Australia
and Michael Irvin was on the plane

6313
02:48:32,781 --> 02:48:33,800
just by random,

6314
02:48:33,890 --> 02:48:34,221
you know,

6315
02:48:34,221 --> 02:48:35,090
it's a long ass flights,

6316
02:48:35,091 --> 02:48:35,924
like 14 hours.

6317
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:38,540
So me and him got to
talk and super good dude,

6318
02:48:38,541 --> 02:48:39,860
like real nice guy.

6319
02:48:39,861 --> 02:48:41,870
I mean phenomenal football player,

6320
02:48:41,871 --> 02:48:43,640
but just like you would
never know it talking to him,

6321
02:48:43,670 --> 02:48:44,330
just super,

6322
02:48:44,330 --> 02:48:45,320
super down to earth.

6323
02:48:46,010 --> 02:48:47,210
But he was talking about um,

6324
02:48:47,211 --> 02:48:48,470
work he does with kids,

6325
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:49,393
with um,

6326
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:51,890
kids that and trying to sort of,

6327
02:48:51,930 --> 02:48:52,290
uh,

6328
02:48:52,290 --> 02:48:53,960
aluminate to people.

6329
02:48:54,530 --> 02:48:59,270
What happens to someone who grows up
in a terrible community where they

6330
02:48:59,271 --> 02:49:03,230
experience a lot of violence in the
neighborhood or their family experiences,

6331
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:07,010
violence or that the mother does
while the boys in the womb that this

6332
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:09,960
literally their behavior patterns,

6333
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:10,853
thought pattern,

6334
02:49:11,190 --> 02:49:12,210
they come out of that,

6335
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:14,790
they come out of the
gate with a faster fuse,

6336
02:49:14,791 --> 02:49:15,750
a shorter fuse,

6337
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:16,021
uh,

6338
02:49:16,021 --> 02:49:16,441
more,

6339
02:49:16,441 --> 02:49:18,180
more inclinations towards violence.

6340
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:19,080
You know,

6341
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,400
different hormone rates.

6342
02:49:20,430 --> 02:49:22,800
Either their body reacts
to stress differently,

6343
02:49:22,910 --> 02:49:23,940
they're quicker to snap,

6344
02:49:24,120 --> 02:49:25,980
the quicker to make impulsive,

6345
02:49:26,010 --> 02:49:28,680
violent judgments and
beat people up and shit.

6346
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:32,730
Like a lot of the people
that are in these situations,

6347
02:49:32,731 --> 02:49:36,210
like what you're dealing with is like a
programming from the time they're in the

6348
02:49:36,211 --> 02:49:38,250
womb and it's very difficult to correct.

6349
02:49:38,640 --> 02:49:42,450
And then we have to like really not
think about it in terms of like here's a

6350
02:49:42,451 --> 02:49:45,930
person who's doing a bad thing and
think about it more in terms of like,

6351
02:49:45,931 --> 02:49:46,590
well wait a minute,

6352
02:49:46,590 --> 02:49:47,880
why is he so angry?

6353
02:49:47,910 --> 02:49:49,230
How did he get like this?

6354
02:49:49,231 --> 02:49:49,651
What,

6355
02:49:49,651 --> 02:49:50,484
what happened?

6356
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:54,570
Like we can just get out of let it happen
over and over again and keep blaming

6357
02:49:54,571 --> 02:49:56,070
people who get it wrong and say,

6358
02:49:56,071 --> 02:49:56,281
hey,

6359
02:49:56,281 --> 02:49:58,980
everybody figured out because we're
going to keep locking you up or,

6360
02:49:59,040 --> 02:50:00,090
or should they look at it and go,

6361
02:50:00,091 --> 02:50:01,050
how is this happening?

6362
02:50:01,600 --> 02:50:02,700
What is causing people?

6363
02:50:02,701 --> 02:50:03,420
Hey look,

6364
02:50:03,420 --> 02:50:06,180
Mike grew up on the south side of Chicago.

6365
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:09,810
Everyone in his neighborhood was
getting beat up and shot and you know,

6366
02:50:09,811 --> 02:50:11,370
if someone says something to him,

6367
02:50:11,371 --> 02:50:12,061
he can't even help.

6368
02:50:12,061 --> 02:50:15,600
But he just sucker punches you cause
he's on edge all the fucking time.

6369
02:50:15,870 --> 02:50:17,250
Are we supposed to treat him the same way?

6370
02:50:17,251 --> 02:50:21,540
We're going to treat Chad who grows up
in the country club and the where's izod

6371
02:50:21,541 --> 02:50:22,500
shirts and his,

6372
02:50:22,770 --> 02:50:25,650
his parents are both on Xanax and
everybody's cool and the maid raised him.

6373
02:50:25,830 --> 02:50:26,071
I'm like,

6374
02:50:26,071 --> 02:50:26,640
go get a tree.

6375
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:27,320
No,

6376
02:50:27,320 --> 02:50:28,590
they're not the same people.

6377
02:50:28,620 --> 02:50:32,190
These are not the same kind of
human beings like some human beings.

6378
02:50:32,670 --> 02:50:33,870
They got a shitty deal.

6379
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:34,860
They got a shit deal,

6380
02:50:34,861 --> 02:50:35,071
man.

6381
02:50:35,071 --> 02:50:36,750
Does she get a shit deal
coming into this planet?

6382
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:41,780
We've got to figure out how to stop those
shit deals from taking place so often

6383
02:50:41,910 --> 02:50:45,330
figure out a way to like
make it nicer for people.

6384
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:50,280
Like the worst problems are people that
come out of horrible situations in their

6385
02:50:50,281 --> 02:50:54,120
life when they're young and then go on
to do violence and terrible things when

6386
02:50:54,121 --> 02:50:54,660
they get older.

6387
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:54,960
Yeah.

6388
02:50:54,960 --> 02:50:58,230
If you could just get
to them that early fuck,

6389
02:50:58,520 --> 02:50:58,890
look,

6390
02:50:58,890 --> 02:51:01,170
everybody calm down,

6391
02:51:01,440 --> 02:51:02,220
everybody relax.

6392
02:51:02,220 --> 02:51:06,930
Like let's figure out a way to get you
all paths to success and get you to

6393
02:51:06,931 --> 02:51:11,931
figure out like coaching and life
coaching and education and counseling and

6394
02:51:14,251 --> 02:51:18,330
community and you're wanted and loved
and everyone's together and you have a

6395
02:51:18,331 --> 02:51:20,040
stake in this game just
as much as everybody else.

6396
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:20,260
Yeah.

6397
02:51:20,260 --> 02:51:22,620
And then it have this kid
with kids when they're young,

6398
02:51:22,770 --> 02:51:27,630
you'll develop phenomenal human beings
instead of people that are likely to grow

6399
02:51:27,631 --> 02:51:28,860
up and you know,

6400
02:51:28,950 --> 02:51:32,100
engage in the kind of patterns
that they saw all their life.

6401
02:51:32,210 --> 02:51:32,481
Yeah.

6402
02:51:32,481 --> 02:51:35,600
I think like a big bet
going our school system,

6403
02:51:35,601 --> 02:51:37,370
like we're not taught
how to use our brains.

6404
02:51:37,371 --> 02:51:40,130
We're not taught how to deal with
certain emotions when they arise.

6405
02:51:40,190 --> 02:51:41,420
We're just taught math,

6406
02:51:41,421 --> 02:51:41,690
science,

6407
02:51:41,690 --> 02:51:42,523
all that stuff.

6408
02:51:42,860 --> 02:51:43,910
I think the school system,

6409
02:51:43,911 --> 02:51:48,470
we need to implement more teaching
us how to meditate and a control,

6410
02:51:48,471 --> 02:51:49,304
our thoughts,

6411
02:51:49,900 --> 02:51:50,660
our emotions.

6412
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:54,920
Just like Rhonda Patrick says like what
the mom's eating has so much to do with

6413
02:51:54,921 --> 02:51:58,010
how that baby's formed and how
healthy it's foreign for sure.

6414
02:51:58,540 --> 02:51:58,950
Sure.

6415
02:51:58,950 --> 02:51:59,680
Small extent.

6416
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:00,200
Yeah.

6417
02:52:00,200 --> 02:52:00,531
I mean,

6418
02:52:00,531 --> 02:52:01,364
it's all,

6419
02:52:01,370 --> 02:52:03,680
there's so many factors and then,

6420
02:52:03,681 --> 02:52:04,514
you know,

6421
02:52:04,550 --> 02:52:06,400
there's things

6422
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:09,130
that you're just never gonna be able
to control like where you're born,

6423
02:52:09,131 --> 02:52:09,371
like,

6424
02:52:09,371 --> 02:52:09,850
who,

6425
02:52:09,850 --> 02:52:11,110
who your parents are,

6426
02:52:11,380 --> 02:52:12,880
what part of the world do you live on?

6427
02:52:12,881 --> 02:52:14,410
And we were all lucky as shit,

6428
02:52:14,411 --> 02:52:18,520
even the poorest of us to be here in
America where you could be in a shitty

6429
02:52:18,521 --> 02:52:21,010
neighborhood and managed to get out and,

6430
02:52:21,450 --> 02:52:22,181
and become,

6431
02:52:22,181 --> 02:52:22,510
uh,

6432
02:52:22,510 --> 02:52:26,050
at least a financial success is
places where that's just not possible.

6433
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:27,033
You know,

6434
02:52:27,160 --> 02:52:30,190
literally how lucky are we that we're not
living in fucking Singapore where they

6435
02:52:30,191 --> 02:52:33,640
could just pull you over and just lock
you in a cage for a year because you

6436
02:52:33,641 --> 02:52:34,750
liked to smoke plants.

6437
02:52:35,790 --> 02:52:36,280
Yeah.

6438
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:37,110
No Shit.

6439
02:52:37,110 --> 02:52:38,440
It's fucking insane shit.

6440
02:52:39,550 --> 02:52:39,910
Yeah,

6441
02:52:39,910 --> 02:52:40,743
we're,

6442
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:42,070
we're all insanely lucky.

6443
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:44,590
I bet it's pretty crazy being a dad.

6444
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:45,960
It's crazy.

6445
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,480
I'm bet.

6446
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:46,930
Yeah.

6447
02:52:46,930 --> 02:52:47,740
Holy Shit.

6448
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:50,230
It's hard to wrap your head
around it until you experience it.

6449
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:51,010
I bet.

6450
02:52:51,010 --> 02:52:51,460
Dude,

6451
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:52,900
it is a very,

6452
02:52:52,901 --> 02:52:53,800
very rewarding,

6453
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:55,400
but it's also very strange,

6454
02:52:55,420 --> 02:53:00,280
very humbling changes your whole
perspective on things you like.

6455
02:53:00,281 --> 02:53:03,310
You love these little people in a way
that you didn't even know you could love

6456
02:53:04,200 --> 02:53:05,033
and it's,

6457
02:53:05,050 --> 02:53:05,980
you just feel different.

6458
02:53:06,010 --> 02:53:07,060
You feel different about people.

6459
02:53:07,090 --> 02:53:08,110
I look at people now,

6460
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:08,441
men,

6461
02:53:08,441 --> 02:53:08,890
women,

6462
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:09,723
everybody.

6463
02:53:10,150 --> 02:53:11,650
I look at them like
they used to be a baby.

6464
02:53:12,760 --> 02:53:15,280
That started to happen almost
immediately after I had a kid.

6465
02:53:15,281 --> 02:53:16,960
Like I never used to
think about it that way.

6466
02:53:17,170 --> 02:53:20,620
If I saw some dude and he was fucking
like 70 years old yelling at people,

6467
02:53:20,621 --> 02:53:21,221
fuck you,

6468
02:53:21,221 --> 02:53:22,900
get off my lawn or whatever,

6469
02:53:22,901 --> 02:53:23,440
you know,

6470
02:53:23,440 --> 02:53:23,831
I'd be like,

6471
02:53:23,831 --> 02:53:24,790
look at that old dickhead.

6472
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:25,683
I'll beat your ass.

6473
02:53:25,690 --> 02:53:28,240
I just think he's an old dick
and fuck that little dickhead.

6474
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:29,920
But now I go,

6475
02:53:29,980 --> 02:53:30,101
oh,

6476
02:53:30,101 --> 02:53:32,230
that was a baby man.

6477
02:53:32,260 --> 02:53:35,050
That was a baby that
just went through life.

6478
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:37,000
And then got to the point where it's this,

6479
02:53:37,360 --> 02:53:38,740
this old man who just,

6480
02:53:39,310 --> 02:53:40,143
you know,

6481
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:45,720
everybody could ride that
fucking mechanical bull for
a second or two and seven

6482
02:53:46,241 --> 02:53:47,320
years old and you're like,

6483
02:53:47,321 --> 02:53:51,580
get off my line and you just can't wait
to go back inside and drink yourself to

6484
02:53:51,581 --> 02:53:53,320
death and you're watching judge Judy.

6485
02:53:53,680 --> 02:53:55,420
You know what,

6486
02:53:56,020 --> 02:53:56,410
that's,

6487
02:53:56,410 --> 02:53:57,520
there's a lot of people like that.

6488
02:53:57,521 --> 02:54:02,050
Those people that are out there just in
a room with the fucking walls are yellow

6489
02:54:02,051 --> 02:54:02,950
with cigarettes.

6490
02:54:03,660 --> 02:54:05,160
Just constantly smoking.

6491
02:54:05,170 --> 02:54:08,680
They got a greasy film on all
the windows thrown into Tony's.

6492
02:54:08,780 --> 02:54:09,490
Yeah,

6493
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:14,230
they're just ordering pizza and they're
fucking whole house smells like shit.

6494
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:19,600
Those people are alive right now and
they were babies and now they're 80 now

6495
02:54:19,601 --> 02:54:21,550
they're 80 years old coffin.

6496
02:54:21,551 --> 02:54:22,990
They got a tube in their neck.

6497
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:25,060
Maybe they got a fucking oxygen tank.

6498
02:54:25,061 --> 02:54:27,550
They take with them the little
too that goes up their nose.

6499
02:54:27,610 --> 02:54:28,750
And how were they raised?

6500
02:54:28,751 --> 02:54:30,070
Who were they raised around?

6501
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:30,730
Yeah.

6502
02:54:30,730 --> 02:54:31,481
How were they raised?

6503
02:54:31,481 --> 02:54:32,590
Did they get a good deal?

6504
02:54:32,690 --> 02:54:33,260
They eat.

6505
02:54:33,260 --> 02:54:33,670
Yeah.

6506
02:54:33,670 --> 02:54:34,290
They get a good,

6507
02:54:34,290 --> 02:54:37,300
they get a good deal with around nice
people when they were young or did people

6508
02:54:37,301 --> 02:54:41,380
smack him for no reason when they were
a little baby that people drop them on

6509
02:54:41,381 --> 02:54:41,920
their head.

6510
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:42,760
What happened to him?

6511
02:54:42,940 --> 02:54:43,270
You know,

6512
02:54:43,270 --> 02:54:45,010
what kind of education did they get?

6513
02:54:45,280 --> 02:54:47,170
What kind of nutrition
did they get growing up?

6514
02:54:47,171 --> 02:54:48,550
How well did their brain develop?

6515
02:54:48,670 --> 02:54:49,270
God,

6516
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:49,750
you know,

6517
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:52,390
it really does make you want to
just treat everyone nice suit.

6518
02:54:52,391 --> 02:54:53,110
It could be us.

6519
02:54:53,110 --> 02:54:53,771
That's the thing.

6520
02:54:53,771 --> 02:54:56,400
You could be born in uh,

6521
02:54:56,550 --> 02:54:56,800
uh,

6522
02:54:56,800 --> 02:54:59,140
terrible community in,

6523
02:54:59,141 --> 02:54:59,910
you know,

6524
02:54:59,910 --> 02:55:00,610
fill the bikes.

6525
02:55:00,610 --> 02:55:01,390
Russia,

6526
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:02,410
you could have been born there.

6527
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:04,340
You could've been in some

6528
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:07,610
nightmare crime infested part of Liberia.

6529
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:08,451
You could have been fine.

6530
02:55:08,451 --> 02:55:09,470
There could have been you,

6531
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:10,790
you could be in Libya right now.

6532
02:55:10,791 --> 02:55:13,940
You could be a little child born in Libya
right now you have no control of your

6533
02:55:13,941 --> 02:55:14,720
environment.

6534
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:18,200
And there is basically a failed state
where they're reintroducing slavery,

6535
02:55:18,201 --> 02:55:18,951
open markets.

6536
02:55:18,951 --> 02:55:19,784
You can watch people,

6537
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:22,880
there's slave trade auctions on youtube.

6538
02:55:22,881 --> 02:55:23,990
You could see him in Libya.

6539
02:55:24,230 --> 02:55:25,063
Yeah.

6540
02:55:25,100 --> 02:55:25,401
Did you ever,

6541
02:55:25,401 --> 02:55:26,130
if you've seen it right?

6542
02:55:26,130 --> 02:55:27,770
Jemele terrifying.

6543
02:55:27,771 --> 02:55:31,900
So Frances and Gyno spoke out about it
after he knocked out Alistair Overeem.

6544
02:55:31,901 --> 02:55:34,730
It's one of the things that he wanted to
talk about when he knew he was going to

6545
02:55:34,731 --> 02:55:35,630
be fighting for the title.

6546
02:55:36,140 --> 02:55:36,771
Basically,

6547
02:55:36,771 --> 02:55:36,981
you know,

6548
02:55:36,981 --> 02:55:37,790
in his,

6549
02:55:37,790 --> 02:55:38,180
he had,

6550
02:55:38,180 --> 02:55:39,420
he's not the best at English.

6551
02:55:39,421 --> 02:55:40,101
She's still learning it.

6552
02:55:40,101 --> 02:55:40,641
But he was like,

6553
02:55:40,641 --> 02:55:41,060
you know,

6554
02:55:41,060 --> 02:55:43,010
I just want to say fuck slavery like this.

6555
02:55:43,011 --> 02:55:47,570
This is crazy that this is happening
today in 2018 they have slavery and Libya.

6556
02:55:48,090 --> 02:55:51,980
They ha they were shipped people or
cell phone camera footage of the slave

6557
02:55:51,981 --> 02:55:52,191
auction.

6558
02:55:52,191 --> 02:55:53,024
It's going on.

6559
02:55:53,450 --> 02:55:53,991
Damn,

6560
02:55:53,991 --> 02:55:54,390
dude,

6561
02:55:54,390 --> 02:55:55,720
that's fucked up.

6562
02:55:55,790 --> 02:55:56,030
Yeah,

6563
02:55:56,030 --> 02:55:56,863
that could be us.

6564
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:57,260
Yeah,

6565
02:55:57,260 --> 02:55:58,093
we can be born there.

6566
02:55:58,100 --> 02:55:58,281
You know,

6567
02:55:58,281 --> 02:55:59,114
we got lucky.

6568
02:55:59,150 --> 02:56:01,400
Everyone got lucky and
some got lucky than others.

6569
02:56:01,970 --> 02:56:02,990
But the,

6570
02:56:03,080 --> 02:56:06,170
the lack of just,

6571
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:08,600
not just an understanding of that,

6572
02:56:08,870 --> 02:56:10,250
but the action,

6573
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:12,620
like the fact that we always think we
have to do all these different things in

6574
02:56:12,621 --> 02:56:13,430
other countries.

6575
02:56:13,430 --> 02:56:13,671
Uh,

6576
02:56:13,671 --> 02:56:16,070
we have to go over there and help
these people out there trade.

6577
02:56:16,100 --> 02:56:16,251
Oh,

6578
02:56:16,251 --> 02:56:18,680
we have to go over here and
there's a steel embargo.

6579
02:56:18,681 --> 02:56:19,610
We need to talk to these people.

6580
02:56:19,770 --> 02:56:19,960
Yeah,

6581
02:56:19,960 --> 02:56:20,360
yeah.

6582
02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:21,710
We were sure we definitely do.

6583
02:56:21,740 --> 02:56:21,951
But what,

6584
02:56:21,951 --> 02:56:22,101
you know,

6585
02:56:22,101 --> 02:56:23,030
we really need to do.

6586
02:56:23,090 --> 02:56:25,280
We need to fix up these
fucking poor cities.

6587
02:56:25,640 --> 02:56:26,450
Fixed this up.

6588
02:56:26,450 --> 02:56:28,130
You had a horrible poverty.

6589
02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:32,120
You've got places where you have block
after block with boarded up windows and

6590
02:56:32,121 --> 02:56:32,421
you know,

6591
02:56:32,421 --> 02:56:33,410
this is exists,

6592
02:56:33,411 --> 02:56:33,740
right?

6593
02:56:33,740 --> 02:56:34,730
The reservations.

6594
02:56:34,880 --> 02:56:35,540
Oh Dude.

6595
02:56:35,540 --> 02:56:36,060
Ah,

6596
02:56:36,060 --> 02:56:37,100
that's a different world.

6597
02:56:37,101 --> 02:56:38,300
They're two different worlds.

6598
02:56:38,330 --> 02:56:39,163
It really is.

6599
02:56:39,200 --> 02:56:39,740
Yeah.

6600
02:56:39,740 --> 02:56:43,700
But it's like that's never
something that's discussed
when people talk about the

6601
02:56:43,701 --> 02:56:46,640
problems that this country
faces there they live roughly,

6602
02:56:46,720 --> 02:56:47,090
you know,

6603
02:56:47,090 --> 02:56:49,460
economic crisis and they use words like,

6604
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:50,271
you know,

6605
02:56:50,271 --> 02:56:50,580
um,

6606
02:56:50,580 --> 02:56:50,771
you know,

6607
02:56:50,771 --> 02:56:53,360
welfare and a quality or you know,

6608
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:55,100
uh,

6609
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:56,120
income inequality,

6610
02:56:56,121 --> 02:56:57,230
the use these terms.

6611
02:56:57,410 --> 02:56:58,550
But at the end of the day,

6612
02:56:58,551 --> 02:56:59,211
we don't think about,

6613
02:56:59,211 --> 02:56:59,361
no,

6614
02:56:59,361 --> 02:57:00,800
it's just like people that are fucked,

6615
02:57:01,130 --> 02:57:01,940
they're fucked.

6616
02:57:01,940 --> 02:57:02,391
Like their,

6617
02:57:02,391 --> 02:57:03,710
their situation is fucked.

6618
02:57:03,711 --> 02:57:07,820
It's not good and they don't get the
same break is someone who lives in a nice

6619
02:57:07,821 --> 02:57:08,810
neighborhood in Columbus,

6620
02:57:08,811 --> 02:57:09,230
Ohio.

6621
02:57:09,230 --> 02:57:10,310
They're not getting the same break.

6622
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:11,960
It's a different situation.

6623
02:57:12,170 --> 02:57:13,070
And until you fix that,

6624
02:57:13,071 --> 02:57:15,530
you're going to make
criminals and angry people.

6625
02:57:15,560 --> 02:57:17,780
And pay people that are
dysfunctional and people that are,

6626
02:57:17,781 --> 02:57:17,961
you know,

6627
02:57:17,961 --> 02:57:21,920
they're lashing out because
they experienced violence
and no love their entire

6628
02:57:21,921 --> 02:57:22,220
life.

6629
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:23,180
You can always get that,

6630
02:57:23,181 --> 02:57:23,780
Matt,

6631
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:25,190
and this is what I was
talking about earlier,

6632
02:57:25,191 --> 02:57:29,690
that our technology is constantly
and rapidly accelerating,

6633
02:57:29,930 --> 02:57:34,190
but our understanding of our interactions
with each other is still fucked up.

6634
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:38,570
It's still clunky and
not well thought through.

6635
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:43,700
And as much as we know about so many
different factors in terms of like how

6636
02:57:43,701 --> 02:57:44,750
human beings develop,

6637
02:57:44,751 --> 02:57:47,210
we put almost no effort into fixing it.

6638
02:57:47,270 --> 02:57:47,421
Well,

6639
02:57:47,421 --> 02:57:47,961
what the fuck?

6640
02:57:47,961 --> 02:57:48,860
What would help?

6641
02:57:49,400 --> 02:57:54,400
They would have to go on an all out
campaign to reinvigorate horrible

6642
02:57:54,981 --> 02:57:55,814
neighborhoods.

6643
02:57:56,060 --> 02:57:56,990
They would have to fix,

6644
02:57:57,020 --> 02:58:02,020
they would have to use government
money to fix these houses and fix these

6645
02:58:02,101 --> 02:58:03,240
neighborhoods and make,

6646
02:58:03,390 --> 02:58:05,970
make it safer with more police force.

6647
02:58:06,270 --> 02:58:06,631
Um,

6648
02:58:06,631 --> 02:58:09,610
make community centers where
people can go and be safe,

6649
02:58:09,611 --> 02:58:12,090
set it up so they can do activities
there that they would like.

6650
02:58:12,570 --> 02:58:12,871
You know,

6651
02:58:12,871 --> 02:58:13,141
there's,

6652
02:58:13,141 --> 02:58:18,141
there's gotta be ways that you can
invigorate these places and you somehow or

6653
02:58:18,421 --> 02:58:20,550
another figure out a way to get
work for a lot of these people.

6654
02:58:20,730 --> 02:58:21,870
Give them counseling,

6655
02:58:21,900 --> 02:58:22,530
give them,

6656
02:58:22,530 --> 02:58:22,821
let,

6657
02:58:22,821 --> 02:58:23,491
let people know that.

6658
02:58:23,491 --> 02:58:26,310
And I've never really been to school
and they're in their fucking twenties

6659
02:58:26,311 --> 02:58:27,180
there's a place we can go,

6660
02:58:27,181 --> 02:58:28,710
we can teach you how to write and read.

6661
02:58:28,900 --> 02:58:29,733
This is real.

6662
02:58:29,940 --> 02:58:32,430
There's a lot of people that are
like this and in the real world,

6663
02:58:34,140 --> 02:58:34,381
you know,

6664
02:58:34,381 --> 02:58:35,214
we can,

6665
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:39,210
we can fix things if we put
money and time into them.

6666
02:58:39,330 --> 02:58:40,440
Like the way they decided,

6667
02:58:40,441 --> 02:58:44,190
like they were using Halbert and to go
and rebuild places that we blew up in

6668
02:58:44,191 --> 02:58:45,024
Iraq.

6669
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:46,110
Like that's what they do.

6670
02:58:46,111 --> 02:58:48,510
They go and re fix stuff that we fucking,

6671
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:49,860
they build,

6672
02:58:49,860 --> 02:58:51,330
they build shit that we fuck up.

6673
02:58:51,360 --> 02:58:51,541
You know,

6674
02:58:51,541 --> 02:58:54,810
they go over and then they put power
plants and do all kinds of other shit over

6675
02:58:54,811 --> 02:58:54,991
there.

6676
02:58:54,991 --> 02:58:57,480
But they had to get these giant
contracts to go over there and do that.

6677
02:58:57,810 --> 02:58:58,643
Okay.

6678
02:58:58,710 --> 02:59:01,110
Well we definitely blew things up
so we should definitely fix it.

6679
02:59:01,111 --> 02:59:02,760
But shouldn't we fix Chicago too?

6680
02:59:03,170 --> 02:59:06,570
What are you going to gang
violence constantly in Chicago.

6681
02:59:07,230 --> 02:59:09,600
Death rate in Chicago is crazy.

6682
02:59:09,601 --> 02:59:10,110
Right?

6683
02:59:10,110 --> 02:59:12,430
Or Detroit or you know,

6684
02:59:12,570 --> 02:59:13,381
fill in the blank,

6685
02:59:13,381 --> 02:59:17,250
whatever bad neighborhood it's
experiencing some sort of a drug conflict.

6686
02:59:17,370 --> 02:59:18,300
Reservations.

6687
02:59:18,540 --> 02:59:18,960
Yeah.

6688
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:21,930
And then how about the fact collectively
we all need to look at the fact that

6689
02:59:21,931 --> 02:59:26,430
there's Mexico's right next to us and the
only reason why they have such violent

6690
02:59:26,431 --> 02:59:26,821
crimes,

6691
02:59:26,821 --> 02:59:29,370
cause we lack drugs and we
keep those drugs illegal.

6692
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:30,720
So bad guy sell drugs.

6693
02:59:30,721 --> 02:59:32,730
Like this is fucking stupid shit ever.

6694
02:59:33,160 --> 02:59:33,841
It's like you don't,

6695
02:59:33,841 --> 02:59:34,710
you know it.

6696
02:59:34,711 --> 02:59:35,760
Everybody knows it.

6697
02:59:35,761 --> 02:59:36,450
This isn't,

6698
02:59:36,450 --> 02:59:37,770
I'm not a smart guy.

6699
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:39,000
Like if I know it,

6700
02:59:39,001 --> 02:59:39,480
I'm not,

6701
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:40,440
I'm no genius.

6702
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:42,540
If I know the solution.

6703
02:59:42,870 --> 02:59:46,410
You don't think the people in the
highest levels of government know the

6704
02:59:46,411 --> 02:59:46,860
solution.

6705
02:59:46,860 --> 02:59:47,221
But Dude,

6706
02:59:47,221 --> 02:59:50,670
you're a lot smarter than you think
because think of the people you talk to

6707
02:59:50,770 --> 02:59:51,600
everyday,

6708
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:55,410
deep conversations as you guys are a
lot of knowledge that people have never.

6709
02:59:55,440 --> 02:59:55,531
Yeah.

6710
02:59:55,531 --> 02:59:59,790
But see that's the difference between
knowledge that you just sort of remember

6711
02:59:59,791 --> 03:00:01,170
things that people have told you,

6712
03:00:01,470 --> 03:00:04,260
which I got some of that and
actually have an an education in it.

6713
03:00:04,500 --> 03:00:05,370
That's the difference.

6714
03:00:05,490 --> 03:00:07,230
Like if people ask me about martial arts,

6715
03:00:07,600 --> 03:00:11,930
I can understand almost everything you
want to talk about with martial arts,

6716
03:00:12,090 --> 03:00:14,250
with the exception of some
judo and some wrestling,

6717
03:00:14,550 --> 03:00:14,791
you know,

6718
03:00:14,791 --> 03:00:15,780
some judo and some wrestling.

6719
03:00:15,781 --> 03:00:18,500
I would want to talk to an expert in
what makes sure that I got my positions,

6720
03:00:18,530 --> 03:00:18,980
my,

6721
03:00:18,980 --> 03:00:22,080
my understanding of what
the best thing to do.

6722
03:00:22,350 --> 03:00:25,230
But everything else I'm going to
sacred in Michael Poland said though,

6723
03:00:25,260 --> 03:00:26,580
how long on sleep,

6724
03:00:26,610 --> 03:00:27,930
how long do doctors get?

6725
03:00:27,930 --> 03:00:30,300
Like how long is their
courses on sleep one course.

6726
03:00:30,330 --> 03:00:33,630
How long exactly listened to them
or do you listen to your podcast?

6727
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:33,871
Yeah,

6728
03:00:33,871 --> 03:00:35,460
but I don't listen to them
when it comes to sleep.

6729
03:00:35,461 --> 03:00:38,070
I listen to a guy like Matthew
Walker who's asleep expert.

6730
03:00:38,071 --> 03:00:38,510
Yeah.

6731
03:00:38,510 --> 03:00:38,941
You know what I mean?

6732
03:00:38,941 --> 03:00:39,774
There are those.

6733
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:41,070
He's a real,

6734
03:00:41,100 --> 03:00:44,520
he's a real sleep expert so he's the
guy that I should listen to but just

6735
03:00:44,521 --> 03:00:47,130
because I can pair it what
he says don't get confused.

6736
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:48,450
Like I'm not smart.

6737
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:49,830
I just remember shit.

6738
03:00:50,250 --> 03:00:51,540
But that's in a way,

6739
03:00:51,541 --> 03:00:53,970
that's smart dude.

6740
03:00:53,971 --> 03:00:56,610
If you could see how my fucking
brain actually functions,

6741
03:00:57,060 --> 03:01:00,340
how I write material and why I need to
constantly keep moving and you'd be like,

6742
03:01:00,370 --> 03:01:00,551
oh,

6743
03:01:00,551 --> 03:01:01,384
you're just crazy.

6744
03:01:01,390 --> 03:01:02,223
You're not smart.

6745
03:01:02,530 --> 03:01:04,040
You just a crazy nice person.

6746
03:01:04,770 --> 03:01:05,560
That's what it is.

6747
03:01:05,560 --> 03:01:07,900
Open minded to definitely open minded.

6748
03:01:07,960 --> 03:01:09,040
I think I need to be,

6749
03:01:09,041 --> 03:01:10,000
and I think we all need to be,

6750
03:01:10,030 --> 03:01:12,460
I think it's one of our
main problems as people,

6751
03:01:12,520 --> 03:01:15,130
and I've been absolutely
guilty of this in the past,

6752
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:19,680
is that we cling to an idea
as if it's our identity.

6753
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:20,643
I'll give it as it,

6754
03:01:20,650 --> 03:01:22,900
if it defines us instead of looking like,

6755
03:01:22,901 --> 03:01:23,620
am I right?

6756
03:01:23,620 --> 03:01:24,453
I might not be right.

6757
03:01:24,700 --> 03:01:26,230
Like there's a lot of power in saying,

6758
03:01:26,290 --> 03:01:26,621
damn,

6759
03:01:26,621 --> 03:01:27,430
I'm wrong.

6760
03:01:27,430 --> 03:01:28,570
There's a lot of power in that.

6761
03:01:28,600 --> 03:01:30,640
There really is and we
need to recognize that.

6762
03:01:30,850 --> 03:01:34,420
We need to recognize like there's power
in saying you're sorry this power and

6763
03:01:34,421 --> 03:01:34,571
like,

6764
03:01:34,571 --> 03:01:34,760
dude,

6765
03:01:34,760 --> 03:01:34,950
I've,

6766
03:01:34,950 --> 03:01:36,010
I definitely fucked up.

6767
03:01:36,190 --> 03:01:36,521
It was,

6768
03:01:36,521 --> 03:01:37,960
I was in the wrong 100%.

6769
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:38,853
I just,

6770
03:01:39,100 --> 03:01:39,791
I don't know what I did.

6771
03:01:39,791 --> 03:01:40,480
I'm sorry.

6772
03:01:40,480 --> 03:01:41,040
You know it,

6773
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:41,201
there's,

6774
03:01:41,201 --> 03:01:42,130
there's power in that.

6775
03:01:42,190 --> 03:01:42,641
He's Poe.

6776
03:01:42,641 --> 03:01:43,750
I feel bad about it.

6777
03:01:43,930 --> 03:01:45,220
There's power in saying,

6778
03:01:45,221 --> 03:01:45,670
you know,

6779
03:01:45,670 --> 03:01:48,550
I thought this was correct and it wasn't.

6780
03:01:48,640 --> 03:01:49,690
I really feel stupid.

6781
03:01:49,930 --> 03:01:50,260
Uh,

6782
03:01:50,260 --> 03:01:50,640
sorry.

6783
03:01:50,640 --> 03:01:51,071
Argued.

6784
03:01:51,071 --> 03:01:51,760
That's so hard.

6785
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:52,750
I really thought I was right.

6786
03:01:52,751 --> 03:01:53,620
I'm fucking idiot.

6787
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:57,240
You gotta be willing to do that if
people were less willing to do that.

6788
03:01:57,250 --> 03:01:58,120
It's like there's some people,

6789
03:01:58,121 --> 03:02:02,140
they say something and they stick with
it and then they'll fucking die on that

6790
03:02:02,141 --> 03:02:02,710
hill.

6791
03:02:02,710 --> 03:02:03,170
Right?

6792
03:02:03,170 --> 03:02:06,930
Like this is why it was so weird that
Donald Trump was trying to say that the

6793
03:02:06,940 --> 03:02:08,780
eagles never stood for the Superbowl.

6794
03:02:09,110 --> 03:02:10,800
There were the kneeling and the,

6795
03:02:10,810 --> 03:02:11,643
you know,

6796
03:02:11,670 --> 03:02:13,000
enough of them didn't want to come.

6797
03:02:13,001 --> 03:02:15,860
So I'm canceling this party uninvited him.

6798
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:18,250
That's crazy.

6799
03:02:18,251 --> 03:02:19,720
And that's why it's crazy.

6800
03:02:19,750 --> 03:02:21,280
It's crazy because of the way we,

6801
03:02:21,310 --> 03:02:22,150
we really,

6802
03:02:22,151 --> 03:02:26,830
in our heart of hearts and understand
how people are capable of communicating

6803
03:02:26,831 --> 03:02:27,664
with each other.

6804
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:28,391
Yeah.

6805
03:02:28,391 --> 03:02:29,410
It's pretty cool.

6806
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:29,861
Yeah.

6807
03:02:29,861 --> 03:02:31,570
We're capable of being
way better than this.

6808
03:02:31,571 --> 03:02:35,230
We just clumsy or just stumbling into
each other and head butting each other and

6809
03:02:35,231 --> 03:02:37,790
shit like a mosh pit and he goes,

6810
03:02:37,850 --> 03:02:38,890
you're just fighting each other.

6811
03:02:38,910 --> 03:02:39,671
There's a lot of that,

6812
03:02:39,671 --> 03:02:40,420
man.

6813
03:02:40,420 --> 03:02:41,141
It's a lot of everybody,

6814
03:02:41,141 --> 03:02:41,861
including me,

6815
03:02:41,861 --> 03:02:44,410
I've done it to everybody
wanting their side to be right.

6816
03:02:44,600 --> 03:02:45,370
Oh yeah.

6817
03:02:45,370 --> 03:02:46,690
Just get so stupid with it.

6818
03:02:46,810 --> 03:02:50,230
That's why it's hard to like wander
out up out of your group of friends.

6819
03:02:50,350 --> 03:02:51,130
Fuck yeah.

6820
03:02:51,130 --> 03:02:51,821
He got like,

6821
03:02:51,821 --> 03:02:52,930
Fuck Eh.

6822
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:53,950
Try to trust people.

6823
03:02:53,951 --> 03:02:54,460
Right.

6824
03:02:54,460 --> 03:02:57,850
Try to find people that aren't
like secretly hoping you fail.

6825
03:02:57,910 --> 03:02:58,743
Yeah.

6826
03:02:58,940 --> 03:02:59,650
A lot of that,

6827
03:02:59,650 --> 03:03:00,461
those people are exhausted.

6828
03:03:00,461 --> 03:03:01,240
Similar mindset.

6829
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:03,680
It's constantly sharing different
articles you find in that,

6830
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:04,523
I don't know,

6831
03:03:04,840 --> 03:03:07,150
pretty lucky and being
honest about what you know.

6832
03:03:07,470 --> 03:03:07,870
You know,

6833
03:03:07,870 --> 03:03:09,220
don't pretend to know more than you know.

6834
03:03:09,870 --> 03:03:10,560
You know,

6835
03:03:10,560 --> 03:03:12,070
going to be aware of what you know.

6836
03:03:12,100 --> 03:03:12,970
Like someone like you.

6837
03:03:12,971 --> 03:03:14,440
Like I could listen to an expert,

6838
03:03:14,441 --> 03:03:15,071
nutritionists,

6839
03:03:15,071 --> 03:03:16,160
they kind of overweight.

6840
03:03:16,161 --> 03:03:16,691
It doesn't look good.

6841
03:03:16,691 --> 03:03:18,970
Or someone like you who's
not an expert nutritionist,

6842
03:03:18,971 --> 03:03:19,870
but look at your body.

6843
03:03:19,900 --> 03:03:21,910
You have a lot of fucking
knowledge that you learned.

6844
03:03:22,060 --> 03:03:22,241
Yeah,

6845
03:03:22,241 --> 03:03:23,380
but definitely don't listen to me.

6846
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:28,120
Only listened to if I can pair it somebody
else's shit or tell you to go listen

6847
03:03:28,121 --> 03:03:29,950
to their shit because I get things wrong.

6848
03:03:30,060 --> 03:03:30,241
I,

6849
03:03:30,241 --> 03:03:30,790
I don't,

6850
03:03:30,790 --> 03:03:34,270
I'm not educated in the
mechanisms of nutrient absorption.

6851
03:03:34,271 --> 03:03:36,610
So there's like things that if
you take it with certain things,

6852
03:03:36,611 --> 03:03:37,930
it's not good for you.

6853
03:03:38,440 --> 03:03:39,760
Nutritionist will know all that stuff.

6854
03:03:39,761 --> 03:03:40,061
I'm not,

6855
03:03:40,061 --> 03:03:40,661
the person knows.

6856
03:03:40,661 --> 03:03:45,340
I know some things like
don't have saturated fat with
refined carbohydrates and

6857
03:03:45,341 --> 03:03:45,681
sugar.

6858
03:03:45,681 --> 03:03:46,600
It's not a good combination.

6859
03:03:46,601 --> 03:03:47,860
Especially if you have certain genes.

6860
03:03:48,010 --> 03:03:48,940
I know a bunch of shit.

6861
03:03:48,941 --> 03:03:50,590
I know what you're supposed to
eat and not supposed to eat.

6862
03:03:50,591 --> 03:03:51,940
But some nutritionists though,

6863
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,100
even some like at the EOC Pie,

6864
03:03:54,101 --> 03:03:54,934
they'll be like,

6865
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:56,290
oh well not this one.

6866
03:03:56,291 --> 03:03:58,100
But a certain nutritionist
went to school for it,

6867
03:03:58,101 --> 03:03:59,120
got all their degrees and are like,

6868
03:03:59,121 --> 03:03:59,301
yeah,

6869
03:03:59,301 --> 03:04:00,800
you can have Mac and cheese for lunch.

6870
03:04:00,801 --> 03:04:04,100
And then we'll have like a some
vans waffles to get you started.

6871
03:04:04,101 --> 03:04:04,934
It's like,

6872
03:04:05,150 --> 03:04:08,720
oh well they must have got some 1990s
education that I'm saying like how much

6873
03:04:08,721 --> 03:04:11,120
are those are 1990s educations.

6874
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:12,170
If they don't keep up,

6875
03:04:12,171 --> 03:04:12,471
man,

6876
03:04:12,471 --> 03:04:13,340
it can be bad.

6877
03:04:13,341 --> 03:04:13,700
Right?

6878
03:04:13,700 --> 03:04:16,940
Like those food chains from the fucking
eighties and those Dr Seuss books,

6879
03:04:16,941 --> 03:04:17,774
you ever see that shit?

6880
03:04:18,200 --> 03:04:21,530
It was all like cereal and rice and
grain at the bottom must get a better,

6881
03:04:21,531 --> 03:04:24,980
have a lot of that and then and then
after that it was like meat and there was

6882
03:04:24,981 --> 03:04:27,500
eggs and it was a goofy
ass food chain man.

6883
03:04:28,130 --> 03:04:28,460
Damn.

6884
03:04:28,460 --> 03:04:29,300
That's what people thought.

6885
03:04:29,301 --> 03:04:30,020
The Food Pyramid,

6886
03:04:30,020 --> 03:04:32,060
the bottom of it should
be grains and breads,

6887
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:34,370
which are fine as long as you
don't have too much of it.

6888
03:04:35,270 --> 03:04:38,150
That should be a moderation
thing depending on your goals,

6889
03:04:38,151 --> 03:04:38,420
right?

6890
03:04:38,420 --> 03:04:39,260
Like yeah,

6891
03:04:39,261 --> 03:04:42,050
but the thing about the nutrition world,

6892
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:42,950
the real thing,

6893
03:04:43,270 --> 03:04:48,270
it is so complex and so it's so involved
that you really need to talk to an

6894
03:04:52,180 --> 03:04:53,260
actual expert.

6895
03:04:53,261 --> 03:04:54,370
Like if I have issues,

6896
03:04:54,670 --> 03:04:55,960
I have questions about things.

6897
03:04:56,470 --> 03:04:58,810
My number one go to his doctor.

6898
03:04:58,811 --> 03:04:59,680
Rhonda Patrick.

6899
03:04:59,740 --> 03:05:00,040
Yeah,

6900
03:05:00,040 --> 03:05:00,730
number one.

6901
03:05:00,730 --> 03:05:01,391
Cause she's,

6902
03:05:01,391 --> 03:05:06,100
she's 100% scientific with all of her.

6903
03:05:06,130 --> 03:05:07,810
There's no shenanigans.

6904
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:09,370
When she has an idea about something,

6905
03:05:09,371 --> 03:05:10,280
it's based on study.

6906
03:05:10,281 --> 03:05:13,870
She can cite those studies
to you literally at the
drop of a hat and she didn't

6907
03:05:13,871 --> 03:05:14,704
tell you what the,

6908
03:05:14,710 --> 03:05:15,910
what's what's going on.

6909
03:05:15,911 --> 03:05:16,321
Like what,

6910
03:05:16,321 --> 03:05:18,730
why is this good with that
and why does this help that?

6911
03:05:18,731 --> 03:05:21,790
Why is this hurt that like
she's the go to person for me.

6912
03:05:22,030 --> 03:05:23,800
She said she's a wizard,

6913
03:05:24,060 --> 03:05:24,340
you know,

6914
03:05:24,340 --> 03:05:25,480
she's so fucking smart.

6915
03:05:25,481 --> 03:05:27,550
So like I could ask something like that,

6916
03:05:27,551 --> 03:05:28,240
but I'm not,

6917
03:05:28,240 --> 03:05:30,700
I'm absolutely not a nutrition expert.

6918
03:05:30,701 --> 03:05:33,190
I know what I've been able to do
that works pretty good for me.

6919
03:05:33,191 --> 03:05:36,820
And I've got some loose leaf fucking
duct taped together knowledge,

6920
03:05:37,330 --> 03:05:41,830
but they're the real people out there
like Rhonda Patrick or Rob Wolf for Chris

6921
03:05:41,831 --> 03:05:45,180
crush or Ben Greenfield like
I'd bet in here weeks ago,

6922
03:05:45,210 --> 03:05:45,421
dude,

6923
03:05:45,421 --> 03:05:46,050
he's a wizard.

6924
03:05:46,050 --> 03:05:47,130
Listen that three times.

6925
03:05:47,131 --> 03:05:49,980
What are your probably a purple
or brown belt and nutrition then?

6926
03:05:50,100 --> 03:05:50,341
No,

6927
03:05:50,341 --> 03:05:51,300
I think I'm a blue belt.

6928
03:05:51,410 --> 03:05:51,890
No,

6929
03:05:51,890 --> 03:05:52,140
no,

6930
03:05:52,140 --> 03:05:52,640
no.

6931
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,510
I'm being honest.

6932
03:05:53,980 --> 03:05:54,721
50 years old.

6933
03:05:54,721 --> 03:05:55,690
And Jack did.

6934
03:05:55,810 --> 03:05:56,760
Just crazy.

6935
03:05:56,761 --> 03:05:57,720
I told you I'm a crazy person.

6936
03:05:57,721 --> 03:05:58,321
I work out a lot.

6937
03:05:58,321 --> 03:05:59,154
I take TRT.

6938
03:05:59,700 --> 03:06:00,030
Yes.

6939
03:06:00,030 --> 03:06:00,870
All those things help.

6940
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:01,440
Yeah.

6941
03:06:01,440 --> 03:06:01,741
But,

6942
03:06:01,741 --> 03:06:02,490
um,

6943
03:06:02,490 --> 03:06:02,791
the,

6944
03:06:02,791 --> 03:06:04,080
the real experts,

6945
03:06:04,081 --> 03:06:04,350
man,

6946
03:06:04,350 --> 03:06:04,591
they're,

6947
03:06:04,591 --> 03:06:07,050
their knowledge is constantly growing.

6948
03:06:07,051 --> 03:06:12,051
This is the thing about Rhonda that's
so fantastic is she's on top of all of

6949
03:06:12,361 --> 03:06:16,350
these peer reviewed papers and new studies
and all these things that are going

6950
03:06:16,351 --> 03:06:20,130
on and things that are in the process of
going on because she's in this loop of

6951
03:06:20,131 --> 03:06:20,431
clinical,

6952
03:06:20,431 --> 03:06:21,570
she's a clinical researcher,

6953
03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:25,740
so she's in this loop of all these
wizards and she does her own podcast.

6954
03:06:25,741 --> 03:06:26,221
So she's like,

6955
03:06:26,221 --> 03:06:28,920
she's constantly up on
everything that's going on.

6956
03:06:29,380 --> 03:06:33,120
So she'll send you things about
new data and she's always like,

6957
03:06:33,121 --> 03:06:34,350
every time I have her in here,

6958
03:06:34,620 --> 03:06:38,040
it's three hours where I
might talk like five times.

6959
03:06:38,310 --> 03:06:39,091
Like I might go.

6960
03:06:39,091 --> 03:06:40,500
So why does that do that?

6961
03:06:40,650 --> 03:06:41,483
That's a good question.

6962
03:06:44,130 --> 03:06:45,790
And she's not even looking at notes,

6963
03:06:45,791 --> 03:06:46,390
man.

6964
03:06:46,390 --> 03:06:47,223
Like she's,

6965
03:06:47,500 --> 03:06:50,380
and we get to learn from it at
a young age and apply it dude.

6966
03:06:50,381 --> 03:06:50,561
Like,

6967
03:06:50,561 --> 03:06:53,140
so who's to say we're not
fighting healthily at 40?

6968
03:06:53,270 --> 03:06:56,030
If we monitor injuries and
monitor our sparring and all that,

6969
03:06:56,040 --> 03:06:56,580
like,

6970
03:06:56,580 --> 03:06:58,140
well the thing is going
to be brain health.

6971
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:00,030
That's the real problem.

6972
03:07:00,270 --> 03:07:02,100
The real like cat Ghana was here.

6973
03:07:02,630 --> 03:07:05,100
Do you guys see that or listen
to them to see that one yet?

6974
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:09,780
She had a significant brain injury
apparently from Amanda Nunez.

6975
03:07:09,870 --> 03:07:12,030
Amanda Nunez through some boulders,

6976
03:07:13,070 --> 03:07:14,180
boulders,

6977
03:07:14,540 --> 03:07:16,140
they long boulders,

6978
03:07:16,200 --> 03:07:17,460
she hurts people.

6979
03:07:17,490 --> 03:07:18,970
She's a fucking killer.

6980
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:19,530
That,

6981
03:07:19,530 --> 03:07:20,363
and uh,

6982
03:07:20,650 --> 03:07:24,780
she was concussed so badly in that fight
that if fucked up or hormone levels,

6983
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:28,470
she became hypo thyroid from
that fight and continues to be.

6984
03:07:28,471 --> 03:07:29,071
So to this day,

6985
03:07:29,071 --> 03:07:30,330
she gained 25 pounds.

6986
03:07:30,331 --> 03:07:31,710
She said there were 20,

6987
03:07:31,711 --> 03:07:33,360
25 pounds somewhere in the neighborhood,

6988
03:07:33,630 --> 03:07:35,070
somewhere between 20 and 25 pounds.

6989
03:07:35,071 --> 03:07:35,851
Could not shake it off.

6990
03:07:35,851 --> 03:07:36,091
She goes,

6991
03:07:36,091 --> 03:07:36,360
I was,

6992
03:07:36,360 --> 03:07:39,450
I was eating like 400 calories a day
and my body would not let go of this

6993
03:07:39,451 --> 03:07:40,140
weight.

6994
03:07:40,140 --> 03:07:43,920
And then she found out she
was hyperthyroid and she
had all sorts of problems

6995
03:07:43,921 --> 03:07:45,330
with her cognition,

6996
03:07:45,331 --> 03:07:46,380
with their memory,

6997
03:07:46,381 --> 03:07:47,100
with her.

6998
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:47,760
Um,

6999
03:07:47,760 --> 03:07:49,260
she couldn't see when she was sparring,

7000
03:07:49,261 --> 03:07:50,760
she wasn't seeing things anymore.

7001
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:52,050
She wasn't seeing reads,

7002
03:07:52,200 --> 03:07:52,411
you know,

7003
03:07:52,411 --> 03:07:53,850
she wasn't like she fainted,

7004
03:07:53,880 --> 03:07:57,870
she fainted someone she couldn't see their
reaction she see was just charging at

7005
03:07:57,871 --> 03:07:58,704
them full blast.

7006
03:07:58,740 --> 03:07:59,011
She's like,

7007
03:07:59,011 --> 03:08:00,480
I had no sense of what I was doing.

7008
03:08:00,630 --> 03:08:04,890
So she started getting this
crazy magnetic therapy.

7009
03:08:04,920 --> 03:08:06,240
They do this thing on Instagram.

7010
03:08:06,270 --> 03:08:06,841
Yeah.

7011
03:08:06,841 --> 03:08:07,920
You saw it on her Instagram.

7012
03:08:07,950 --> 03:08:08,550
Yeah.

7013
03:08:08,550 --> 03:08:11,850
And it really helped her 100% brought
her back and she said they'd been able to

7014
03:08:11,851 --> 03:08:13,670
do that with soldiers and all these,

7015
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:17,910
they re ignite all these air and they
can target specific areas of your brain

7016
03:08:17,911 --> 03:08:19,650
where you're having a hard
time functioning correctly.

7017
03:08:19,890 --> 03:08:20,191
Wow,

7018
03:08:20,191 --> 03:08:20,820
that's bad.

7019
03:08:20,820 --> 03:08:21,031
Yeah.

7020
03:08:21,031 --> 03:08:24,690
So she got all of her pallets
back over issues and you know,

7021
03:08:24,691 --> 03:08:26,770
she says she feels 100% or close to it,

7022
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:28,733
but that,

7023
03:08:28,770 --> 03:08:29,603
that kind of shit,

7024
03:08:29,730 --> 03:08:30,481
it gives me hope.

7025
03:08:30,481 --> 03:08:30,751
Right?

7026
03:08:30,751 --> 03:08:31,590
Like if they can,

7027
03:08:31,800 --> 03:08:35,190
well that's one sort of
therapy that they can do.

7028
03:08:35,191 --> 03:08:36,780
Maybe there'll be more in the future.

7029
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:41,850
There's a lot of hope and like all this
pioneering stem cell shit and exosomes

7030
03:08:41,851 --> 03:08:44,820
and all these different things that
they're working on to try to regenerate

7031
03:08:44,821 --> 03:08:46,280
neuro tissue pool.

7032
03:08:46,410 --> 03:08:46,741
Really?

7033
03:08:46,741 --> 03:08:47,574
Yeah.

7034
03:08:47,670 --> 03:08:48,420
Who knows?

7035
03:08:48,420 --> 03:08:48,601
I mean,

7036
03:08:48,601 --> 03:08:49,434
we're in a,

7037
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:49,980
you know,

7038
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:50,401
amazing,

7039
03:08:50,401 --> 03:08:51,001
amazing times,

7040
03:08:51,001 --> 03:08:51,834
but again,

7041
03:08:52,140 --> 03:08:55,320
this is just technologically
and medically.

7042
03:08:55,640 --> 03:08:56,041
Still.

7043
03:08:56,041 --> 03:08:57,510
Culturally we're goofy as fuck.

7044
03:08:57,760 --> 03:08:58,593
Yeah.

7045
03:09:00,480 --> 03:09:01,620
Technologically and medically.

7046
03:09:01,621 --> 03:09:01,801
Yeah.

7047
03:09:01,801 --> 03:09:03,690
Like fuck you guys.

7048
03:09:03,691 --> 03:09:05,940
See that they're going to take
away the bikini's and Miss America.

7049
03:09:06,420 --> 03:09:07,020
I saw,

7050
03:09:07,020 --> 03:09:07,651
I saw that.

7051
03:09:07,651 --> 03:09:08,071
I was like,

7052
03:09:08,071 --> 03:09:09,320
come on son Tan.

7053
03:09:09,321 --> 03:09:10,260
It's hilarious.

7054
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:11,220
Listen,

7055
03:09:11,220 --> 03:09:12,480
they're going to make it a contest.

7056
03:09:12,750 --> 03:09:14,790
They're going to not going to
judge them on their looks anymore.

7057
03:09:15,070 --> 03:09:16,170
They're going to make it a contest.

7058
03:09:16,500 --> 03:09:17,820
They're not going to
judge them on their looks.

7059
03:09:17,850 --> 03:09:18,390
Nope.

7060
03:09:18,390 --> 03:09:18,720
Nope.

7061
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:20,370
They're not judging them on
their appearance anymore.

7062
03:09:20,680 --> 03:09:21,513
Holy.

7063
03:09:22,290 --> 03:09:23,250
Do a different thing.

7064
03:09:23,310 --> 03:09:24,450
This is just do a different thing.

7065
03:09:24,600 --> 03:09:25,140
Yeah,

7066
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:27,540
but I guess they want
the name Miss America,

7067
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:30,660
but then how does Miss America
Miss America go to Miss Universe?

7068
03:09:30,661 --> 03:09:31,494
Is that how it works?

7069
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:33,233
You don't know.

7070
03:09:33,390 --> 03:09:36,880
You know he's got all of
them on the saved safety.

7071
03:09:39,420 --> 03:09:41,700
Wasn't that what the one where
Steve Harvey's had the wrong person.

7072
03:09:41,730 --> 03:09:44,310
He felt that was that Miss
America or Miss Universe,

7073
03:09:44,910 --> 03:09:47,250
this universal bloody damn dude,

7074
03:09:48,120 --> 03:09:48,953
that would suck.

7075
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:49,983
Toad suck.

7076
03:09:50,130 --> 03:09:51,210
It's just a crazy thing,

7077
03:09:51,211 --> 03:09:51,481
man.

7078
03:09:51,481 --> 03:09:53,130
To have a a beauty contest.

7079
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:55,210
Imagine if they had them for men.

7080
03:09:55,390 --> 03:09:58,040
I mean they caught bodybuilding
contest or bodybuilding contest.

7081
03:09:58,060 --> 03:09:58,893
That's a different thing.

7082
03:09:58,990 --> 03:10:03,990
But imagine if they had just a gorgeous
man competition and the guys just walk

7083
03:10:04,031 --> 03:10:04,760
out and they would,

7084
03:10:04,760 --> 03:10:04,980
you know,

7085
03:10:04,980 --> 03:10:06,250
to ask them questions.

7086
03:10:06,251 --> 03:10:07,450
So Pale road head,

7087
03:10:07,950 --> 03:10:10,390
we've got to get a redhead in
their showboaty and Boosie all day.

7088
03:10:10,391 --> 03:10:11,740
I don't even care about myself.

7089
03:10:12,820 --> 03:10:13,653
They're like

7090
03:10:15,010 --> 03:10:15,641
crazy shit.

7091
03:10:15,641 --> 03:10:16,474
Just like those women,

7092
03:10:17,110 --> 03:10:17,441
you know,

7093
03:10:17,441 --> 03:10:19,270
everybody's just trying
to say the right thing,

7094
03:10:19,271 --> 03:10:20,380
hoping that they get picked.

7095
03:10:21,270 --> 03:10:22,103
That's fucking fun.

7096
03:10:22,120 --> 03:10:22,811
That's a weird thing,

7097
03:10:22,811 --> 03:10:23,081
right?

7098
03:10:23,081 --> 03:10:23,990
That this super weird.

7099
03:10:24,060 --> 03:10:26,710
It's not something that anybody's
clamoring for quality on.

7100
03:10:26,711 --> 03:10:29,770
I'll tell you that like no
one's asking for Mr. Mann,

7101
03:10:29,920 --> 03:10:30,790
Mr Handsome,

7102
03:10:30,960 --> 03:10:34,090
all America man to university.

7103
03:10:34,100 --> 03:10:34,933
Yet

7104
03:10:35,940 --> 03:10:39,250
Mr America is only like a bodybuilder.

7105
03:10:39,400 --> 03:10:40,920
Mr universes bodybuilder,

7106
03:10:40,930 --> 03:10:42,400
this Dorian Yates mother Fucker,

7107
03:10:42,401 --> 03:10:43,080
right.

7108
03:10:43,080 --> 03:10:44,650
You know that's Lee Haney.

7109
03:10:44,800 --> 03:10:45,940
That's mister universe.

7110
03:10:46,400 --> 03:10:47,320
Mr Olympia,

7111
03:10:47,350 --> 03:10:47,860
right?

7112
03:10:47,860 --> 03:10:49,210
Mr Olympia is the top of the heap.

7113
03:10:49,240 --> 03:10:50,290
Who's the one with the dreads?

7114
03:10:50,780 --> 03:10:52,120
The spiraling dreads.

7115
03:10:52,150 --> 03:10:53,050
Which one is the body belt?

7116
03:10:53,051 --> 03:10:53,980
Mister universe.

7117
03:10:56,390 --> 03:10:57,040
Oh yeah,

7118
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:57,873
that dude.

7119
03:10:59,260 --> 03:11:00,093
Oh,

7120
03:11:00,130 --> 03:11:01,360
that dude was on fear factor.

7121
03:11:01,361 --> 03:11:02,194
Kelly.

7122
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:04,301
Yeah.

7123
03:11:04,301 --> 03:11:05,134
Kelly muscle.

7124
03:11:05,830 --> 03:11:06,580
Kai Greene.

7125
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:07,151
Oh,

7126
03:11:07,151 --> 03:11:07,391
right,

7127
03:11:07,391 --> 03:11:07,600
right,

7128
03:11:07,600 --> 03:11:07,810
right,

7129
03:11:07,810 --> 03:11:08,021
right,

7130
03:11:08,021 --> 03:11:08,620
right.

7131
03:11:08,620 --> 03:11:08,741
Yeah.

7132
03:11:08,741 --> 03:11:10,810
There's some big ass dudes out there.

7133
03:11:11,470 --> 03:11:13,420
There's some big fucking dude's out there.

7134
03:11:13,450 --> 03:11:14,060
Seriously,

7135
03:11:14,060 --> 03:11:14,893
but

7136
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:17,920
what does that look?

7137
03:11:17,921 --> 03:11:18,071
It is,

7138
03:11:18,071 --> 03:11:19,000
but that's ridiculous.

7139
03:11:19,030 --> 03:11:21,400
You have to look at it
waking up and not look at it.

7140
03:11:21,610 --> 03:11:21,970
Look at his,

7141
03:11:21,970 --> 03:11:22,631
but make it bigger,

7142
03:11:22,631 --> 03:11:23,464
Jamie.

7143
03:11:23,480 --> 03:11:24,040
Dude.

7144
03:11:24,040 --> 03:11:24,811
And He'd get tagged.

7145
03:11:24,811 --> 03:11:26,470
Yet the fuck Outta here.

7146
03:11:26,471 --> 03:11:26,951
How was that?

7147
03:11:26,951 --> 03:11:27,970
A human's ass.

7148
03:11:28,660 --> 03:11:29,860
And you hear how GSP,

7149
03:11:29,861 --> 03:11:32,110
how messed up he got for
eating all that like,

7150
03:11:32,350 --> 03:11:32,650
man,

7151
03:11:32,650 --> 03:11:35,350
these guys insides I guess
their lifespans not long.

7152
03:11:35,351 --> 03:11:35,650
Right?

7153
03:11:35,650 --> 03:11:37,780
That guy must have a
dick like a rhino horn.

7154
03:11:38,310 --> 03:11:42,130
We're just a little pecker
head size of these fuckers.

7155
03:11:42,970 --> 03:11:44,170
That is just what,

7156
03:11:44,320 --> 03:11:44,740
okay.

7157
03:11:44,740 --> 03:11:45,730
Now here's the real question.

7158
03:11:45,760 --> 03:11:46,593
Here's my question.

7159
03:11:46,990 --> 03:11:48,160
I guess maybe I'm ignorant,

7160
03:11:48,370 --> 03:11:50,920
but how the fuck could
you tell who's better?

7161
03:11:51,010 --> 03:11:51,843
No Shit.

7162
03:11:52,370 --> 03:11:54,550
How do you tell they're both.

7163
03:11:55,000 --> 03:11:56,170
They're both ridiculous.

7164
03:11:56,171 --> 03:11:56,351
Like,

7165
03:11:56,351 --> 03:11:57,310
what are you looking for?

7166
03:11:57,490 --> 03:11:59,110
Even even on each side.

7167
03:11:59,111 --> 03:11:59,680
Right?

7168
03:11:59,680 --> 03:12:00,670
How weird is that?

7169
03:12:00,671 --> 03:12:01,504
Yeah,

7170
03:12:01,880 --> 03:12:04,060
because like at the top level,

7171
03:12:04,180 --> 03:12:04,570
when you,

7172
03:12:04,570 --> 03:12:07,660
when you watch like a Mr
Olympia or something like
that and you see eight dudes

7173
03:12:07,661 --> 03:12:09,580
stand onstage flex and do you,

7174
03:12:09,670 --> 03:12:11,410
is one of them stand out to you at all?

7175
03:12:11,690 --> 03:12:12,523
Yeah,

7176
03:12:14,590 --> 03:12:16,030
they all look super jacked.

7177
03:12:17,140 --> 03:12:17,973
Luckily with those two,

7178
03:12:18,950 --> 03:12:19,783
those legs,

7179
03:12:19,800 --> 03:12:21,030
weird life to live wouldn't it?

7180
03:12:21,100 --> 03:12:22,480
Those legs are preposterous.

7181
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:24,940
Those are preposterous thighs.

7182
03:12:25,030 --> 03:12:26,380
That shit doesn't make any sense.

7183
03:12:27,670 --> 03:12:28,870
I mean look at your legs.

7184
03:12:29,010 --> 03:12:29,780
God,

7185
03:12:29,780 --> 03:12:32,170
that's Ronnie Mother Fucker Coleman.

7186
03:12:33,370 --> 03:12:34,810
Ronnie Coleman in his day.

7187
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:35,440
What would you be?

7188
03:12:35,440 --> 03:12:38,030
Beer tactic if you had to
fight that guy in a fist fight.

7189
03:12:38,220 --> 03:12:41,020
Hang on or stay away or stay away.

7190
03:12:41,110 --> 03:12:41,943
Hang on.

7191
03:12:42,040 --> 03:12:46,420
We got get back going to work.

7192
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,250
You make them work.

7193
03:12:47,250 --> 03:12:48,170
Get two minutes left.

7194
03:12:48,460 --> 03:12:49,061
Two minutes.

7195
03:12:49,061 --> 03:12:50,290
Keep fighting for under hook.

7196
03:12:50,291 --> 03:12:51,124
Stay low.

7197
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:51,650
Yeah.

7198
03:12:51,650 --> 03:12:52,190
That guy's

7199
03:12:52,190 --> 03:12:55,070
got about 45 seconds and I'm seriously,

7200
03:12:55,280 --> 03:12:57,860
I mean it might fuck you up
and throw you through a wall.

7201
03:12:57,880 --> 03:12:58,090
No,

7202
03:12:58,090 --> 03:12:59,330
I didn't get on his back.

7203
03:12:59,331 --> 03:12:59,870
Click.

7204
03:12:59,870 --> 03:13:00,231
Yeah.

7205
03:13:00,231 --> 03:13:01,550
Well getting on the back.

7206
03:13:01,790 --> 03:13:04,850
The problem with that is he will be able
to stand up and he's gonna throw his

7207
03:13:04,851 --> 03:13:06,850
body backwards and try to land on you.

7208
03:13:06,860 --> 03:13:07,580
It hurt.

7209
03:13:07,580 --> 03:13:07,731
Yeah.

7210
03:13:07,731 --> 03:13:10,910
You gotta be careful with the whole
ticket guys back when he's still got some

7211
03:13:10,911 --> 03:13:13,030
juice in particular,

7212
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:14,240
right?

7213
03:13:14,240 --> 03:13:14,511
Yeah.

7214
03:13:14,511 --> 03:13:15,650
Street taking someone's back.

7215
03:13:15,651 --> 03:13:16,484
All those dudes.

7216
03:13:16,510 --> 03:13:17,600
I mean it can be done.

7217
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:19,580
Especially if they've
got some juice in there.

7218
03:13:19,690 --> 03:13:20,523
There's still,

7219
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:21,380
they still have strength.

7220
03:13:21,381 --> 03:13:22,550
It just run out of air.

7221
03:13:22,620 --> 03:13:24,140
It can have that one big explosion.

7222
03:13:24,650 --> 03:13:25,940
He's a giant dude though.

7223
03:13:25,941 --> 03:13:28,160
He might be so big if
you did get ahold of him.

7224
03:13:28,161 --> 03:13:29,090
He likes to just throw you

7225
03:13:31,210 --> 03:13:31,860
just spill,

7226
03:13:31,860 --> 03:13:34,080
throw you on top of a car till,

7227
03:13:34,400 --> 03:13:36,020
I mean how much those guys lift?

7228
03:13:36,830 --> 03:13:37,611
Holy Shit.

7229
03:13:37,611 --> 03:13:38,180
No Shit.

7230
03:13:38,180 --> 03:13:40,070
How much did the owner of that 700 squats?

7231
03:13:40,080 --> 03:13:44,600
That's probably just 700 800
x 600 for 20 or some shit.

7232
03:13:45,900 --> 03:13:46,400
Right?

7233
03:13:46,400 --> 03:13:47,650
A weird lifestyle.

7234
03:13:47,900 --> 03:13:50,550
Getting fucking just get jacked everyday.

7235
03:13:50,790 --> 03:13:51,910
Skipjack baby.

7236
03:13:51,950 --> 03:13:52,210
Yeah,

7237
03:13:52,210 --> 03:13:53,090
I can eat all day.

7238
03:13:53,150 --> 03:13:53,460
That's a,

7241
03:13:54,711 --> 03:13:57,770
You kind of like get out of it what
you put in like fighting's not always.

7242
03:13:57,771 --> 03:13:59,060
You don't get out what you put in.

7243
03:13:59,090 --> 03:14:04,070
Always really put in to log in the
left cheek and the right cheek's.

7244
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:05,033
Whoo.

7245
03:14:05,330 --> 03:14:07,100
That's a sport where you have to do it.

7246
03:14:07,130 --> 03:14:08,720
It's like one of the only sports.

7247
03:14:08,870 --> 03:14:09,021

Promotion is this promotion
or Russian promotion?

7332
03:16:39,700 --> 03:16:40,690
Maybe he's,

7333
03:16:40,691 --> 03:16:42,700
he's slimming down like quite a bit.

7334
03:16:42,701 --> 03:16:43,511
It's very interesting.

7335
03:16:43,511 --> 03:16:44,950
He's still fighting to him.

7336
03:16:45,010 --> 03:16:45,580
Yeah.

7337
03:16:45,580 --> 03:16:47,290

7343
03:16:51,520 --> 03:16:52,301
Keep going right there.

7344
03:16:52,301 --> 03:16:52,780
Yeah,

7345
03:16:52,780 --> 03:16:55,240
that's what he used to look like
versus what he looks like now.

7346
03:16:55,990 --> 03:16:58,720
He used to be super duper duper Jack,

7347
03:16:58,721 --> 03:17:00,640
but he's still fucking snake.

7350
03:17:03,461 --> 03:17:04,680
It's strong meeting.

7351
03:17:04,720 --> 03:17:06,160
But he had to lean up man,

7352
03:17:06,161 --> 03:17:07,200
because he was a,

7353
03:17:07,390 --> 03:17:08,560
he just couldn't fight like that.

7354
03:17:08,590 --> 03:17:09,730
He fought Tim Kennedy,

7355
03:17:09,731 --> 03:17:10,030
Bro.

7356
03:17:10,030 --> 03:17:10,391
I mean,

7357
03:17:10,391 --> 03:17:10,680
I'm,

7358
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:11,510
I'm sorry.

7359
03:17:11,510 --> 03:17:12,343
Um,

7360
03:17:13,570 --> 03:17:15,460
fuck Tim.

7361
03:17:15,461 --> 03:17:16,150
Sylvia.

7362
03:17:16,150 --> 03:17:16,810
That's right.

7363
03:17:16,810 --> 03:17:17,381
He fought Tim.

7364
03:17:17,381 --> 03:17:18,214
Sylvia.

7365
03:17:18,340 --> 03:17:18,581
God,

7366
03:17:18,581 --> 03:17:19,900
why did I have that escape me?

7367
03:17:19,990 --> 03:17:22,000
I was thinking maniac and I couldn't
come up with these last name,

7368
03:17:22,790 --> 03:17:24,520
but Tim Silvia beat the shit out of him.

7369
03:17:24,670 --> 03:17:24,911
Oh,

7370
03:17:24,911 --> 03:17:25,570
I bet.

7371
03:17:25,570 --> 03:17:25,800
Well,

7372
03:17:25,800 --> 03:17:27,430
he fought Tim Silvia too young.

7373
03:17:27,640 --> 03:17:28,090
I mean,

7374
03:17:28,090 --> 03:17:28,570
he,

7375
03:17:28,570 --> 03:17:30,790
he just thought because
he was big and strong,

7376
03:17:30,791 --> 03:17:34,750
he would be able to see if you can
find the Paj Nowicki Tim Silvia fight.

7377
03:17:36,160 --> 03:17:36,491
Timmy.

7378
03:17:36,491 --> 03:17:38,380
Timmy is a fucking worldclass.

7379
03:17:38,381 --> 03:17:41,260
UFC heavyweight is no video,

7380
03:17:43,720 --> 03:17:46,550
which say what's it trying
to get directed it to Sylvia,

7381
03:17:46,551 --> 03:17:47,290
not Sylvia.

7382
03:17:47,290 --> 03:17:48,123
Oh

7383
03:17:49,510 --> 03:17:49,841
Damn.

7384
03:17:49,841 --> 03:17:50,770
Slimming down and he's like,

7385
03:17:50,771 --> 03:17:51,604
fuck,

7386
03:17:52,690 --> 03:17:53,860
just go to videos.

7387
03:17:54,130 --> 03:17:54,670
Is it habit?

7388
03:17:54,670 --> 03:17:55,210
Yeah.

7389
03:17:55,210 --> 03:17:55,421
Fair.

7390
03:17:55,421 --> 03:17:56,051
It is fair.

7391
03:17:56,051 --> 03:17:56,884
It is.

7392
03:17:57,730 --> 03:17:58,480
But uh,

7393
03:17:58,480 --> 03:18:02,080
Tim just wore his ass out and
Tim was heavy in that fight too.

7394
03:18:02,440 --> 03:18:04,690
They just more I'm out and
just kept beating them up.

7395
03:18:04,960 --> 03:18:05,950
Tim's giant man.

7396
03:18:06,100 --> 03:18:07,240
He's a big motherfucker,

7397
03:18:07,390 --> 03:18:07,871
but it's just,

7398
03:18:07,871 --> 03:18:09,370
he's just way too skillful,

7399
03:18:09,460 --> 03:18:10,140
like put nasty.

7400
03:18:10,140 --> 03:18:10,990
He was crazy.

7401
03:18:11,140 --> 03:18:13,150
He tried to just beat
on him with his power,

7402
03:18:13,360 --> 03:18:14,500
but good luck with all that.

7403
03:18:14,501 --> 03:18:17,590
And Tim just kept wearing on them
and need them and fucking him up.

7404
03:18:18,210 --> 03:18:21,790
I'm Tim was like super relaxed pace
himself and got him in there and pop,

7405
03:18:21,791 --> 03:18:22,390
pop,

7406
03:18:22,390 --> 03:18:23,710
not throwing with everything.

7407
03:18:23,711 --> 03:18:25,440
He's got to stay in on him.

7408
03:18:25,990 --> 03:18:26,860
Real pro.

7409
03:18:26,920 --> 03:18:31,920
I mean whoever made this fight is a real
fucking like a real sinister person.

7410
03:18:33,870 --> 03:18:34,960
Crazy mismatch.

7411
03:18:35,440 --> 03:18:36,440
But I guess puts you in the house.

7412
03:18:36,441 --> 03:18:37,091
He wanted it,

7413
03:18:37,091 --> 03:18:37,510
man.

7414
03:18:37,510 --> 03:18:37,901
That's the what?

7415
03:18:37,901 --> 03:18:38,291
A stud.

7416
03:18:38,291 --> 03:18:39,040
That guy is.

7417
03:18:39,040 --> 03:18:39,491
Damn.

7418
03:18:39,491 --> 03:18:40,270
That's cool.

7419
03:18:40,270 --> 03:18:40,990
He's a stud.

7420
03:18:40,990 --> 03:18:42,430
I mean he really believed in himself.

7421
03:18:42,550 --> 03:18:44,310
He feels like he's got that kind of power.

7422
03:18:44,311 --> 03:18:45,190
He could kill anybody.

7423
03:18:45,191 --> 03:18:46,270
Just smash them.

7424
03:18:46,360 --> 03:18:47,960
But it didn't work with Tim.

7425
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:50,110
Yeah.

7426
03:18:50,110 --> 03:18:51,900
Tim just eventually started wearing on.

7427
03:18:51,920 --> 03:18:54,820
I'm allowed to do cheer when Randy
hit Tim with that overhand right.

7428
03:18:54,860 --> 03:18:55,451
That was crazy.

7429
03:18:55,451 --> 03:18:57,520
I didn't expect her a couple of seconds.

7430
03:18:58,030 --> 03:18:58,481
Yeah,

7431
03:18:58,481 --> 03:19:01,000
he threw an inside leg
kick and an overhand right.

7432
03:19:01,001 --> 03:19:01,834
And Tim was,

7433
03:19:02,050 --> 03:19:03,100
he was out on his feet.

7434
03:19:03,340 --> 03:19:04,240
Like Tim said.

7435
03:19:04,480 --> 03:19:07,300
He was talking about it at one point in
time in the future and he said that he

7436
03:19:07,301 --> 03:19:09,990
forgot what round it was like there.

7437
03:19:10,070 --> 03:19:10,750
He was like a,

7438
03:19:10,750 --> 03:19:11,620
it's only the third round,

7439
03:19:11,621 --> 03:19:11,830
right?

7440
03:19:11,830 --> 03:19:13,240
Like Tim is the last round.

7441
03:19:13,360 --> 03:19:13,631
He's like,

7442
03:19:13,631 --> 03:19:14,440
what?

7443
03:19:14,440 --> 03:19:15,670
Like you forgot around.

7444
03:19:16,060 --> 03:19:16,241
Yeah.

7445
03:19:16,241 --> 03:19:17,020
Like he,

7446
03:19:17,020 --> 03:19:19,450
he probably was out on
his feet the whole fight.

7447
03:19:19,780 --> 03:19:19,961
I mean,

7448
03:19:19,961 --> 03:19:20,794
think about that.

7449
03:19:20,800 --> 03:19:21,633
That shot.

7450
03:19:21,640 --> 03:19:22,030
Yeah,

7451
03:19:22,030 --> 03:19:24,280
he gets caught right on the jaw.

7452
03:19:25,510 --> 03:19:26,440
That's nuts.

7453
03:19:26,980 --> 03:19:28,300
Seven seconds down.

7454
03:19:28,360 --> 03:19:31,180
Look at this inside leg kick hammer.

7455
03:19:31,390 --> 03:19:33,790
And it's perfectly placed and you know,

7456
03:19:33,791 --> 03:19:37,060
Tim and him were friends and Tim was
really having a hard time believing that

7457
03:19:37,061 --> 03:19:39,820
Randy wanted to fight him because
Randy had stated his house.

7458
03:19:39,820 --> 03:19:42,700
They stayed together for a while
and been friends and he was off.

7459
03:19:42,760 --> 03:19:43,930
Maybe he didn't stay at his house.

7460
03:19:43,931 --> 03:19:44,710
I might've made that up.

7461
03:19:44,710 --> 03:19:45,370
He keeps it good.

7462
03:19:45,370 --> 03:19:46,150
But they were friends.

7463
03:19:46,150 --> 03:19:49,150
I know they were good friends and so
Tim was kind of blown away that Randy

7464
03:19:49,151 --> 03:19:49,721
wanted to fight him.

7465
03:19:49,721 --> 03:19:51,070
But Randy didn't give a fuck.

7466
03:19:51,280 --> 03:19:55,240
Robert Falls told me he'd never saw
Randy lives around in the gym ever.

7467
03:19:55,300 --> 03:19:57,070
It's an animal dude.

7468
03:19:57,700 --> 03:20:00,310
I was there for Randy's debut
fought two times at night.

7469
03:20:00,400 --> 03:20:01,510
Oh yeah.

7470
03:20:01,511 --> 03:20:02,710
He fought two times that night.

7471
03:20:02,830 --> 03:20:04,030
He strangled to people,

7472
03:20:04,210 --> 03:20:05,020
smashed him.

7473
03:20:05,020 --> 03:20:08,830
And he was basically a wrestler who knew
a few submission hold two had dumped

7474
03:20:08,831 --> 03:20:09,910
some boxing in the army,

7475
03:20:10,360 --> 03:20:10,810
you know,

7476
03:20:10,810 --> 03:20:11,411
and nobody,

7477
03:20:11,411 --> 03:20:11,980
uh,

7478
03:20:11,980 --> 03:20:13,120
nobody knew anything back then.

7479
03:20:13,150 --> 03:20:14,260
It started at 30 something,

7480
03:20:14,261 --> 03:20:14,500
right?

7481
03:20:14,500 --> 03:20:14,860
Yup.

7482
03:20:14,860 --> 03:20:18,370
I think he was like 34
or 35 for his UFC debut.

7483
03:20:18,550 --> 03:20:19,340
That's sweet.

7484
03:20:19,340 --> 03:20:20,173
Yeah.

7485
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:20,531
Yeah.

7486
03:20:20,531 --> 03:20:21,700
And then when he fought v toward,

7487
03:20:21,701 --> 03:20:22,480
that's,

7488
03:20:22,480 --> 03:20:22,960
that's,

7489
03:20:22,960 --> 03:20:27,960
that was a really important fight in MMA
or really important fight because v Tor

7490
03:20:29,440 --> 03:20:32,260
was like 240 plus pounds.

7491
03:20:32,261 --> 03:20:33,780
Then he was a jug.

7492
03:20:34,190 --> 03:20:36,300
Same who was jogging tick.

7493
03:20:36,640 --> 03:20:37,540
And He,

7494
03:20:37,541 --> 03:20:37,930
uh,

7495
03:20:37,930 --> 03:20:39,090
had this huge neck,

7496
03:20:39,150 --> 03:20:40,940
his neck started in the
middle of his forehead.

7497
03:20:40,941 --> 03:20:44,250
He was just so huge and they had wrote,

7498
03:20:44,260 --> 03:20:45,640
written for is like strengths.

7499
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:47,620
It's had no known weaknesses.

7500
03:20:48,520 --> 03:20:51,340
Like this is how much
of a a monster Vito was.

7501
03:20:51,341 --> 03:20:52,840
He's just light and everybody on fire.

7502
03:20:53,020 --> 03:20:55,210
But he kept getting bigger
and bigger and bigger.

7503
03:20:55,390 --> 03:20:56,680
He kept getting thicker and bigger.

7504
03:20:56,681 --> 03:20:58,750
And I think one of the
reasons was Mark Coleman,

7505
03:20:59,050 --> 03:21:01,660
I think everybody back then
was scared of Mark Coleman.

7506
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:03,520
Everybody was like fuck.

7507
03:21:03,760 --> 03:21:07,300
Cause Coleman was to 65 and full game.

7508
03:21:08,530 --> 03:21:11,440
He was always like
between two 55 and to 60,

7509
03:21:11,441 --> 03:21:12,310
somewhere in that range.

7510
03:21:12,580 --> 03:21:17,560
But so jacked and mark was
a fucking serious wrestler
and he would take you down

7511
03:21:17,680 --> 03:21:20,800
and he was going to get on top of
you and he was going to deliver pain.

7512
03:21:20,950 --> 03:21:23,590
He was smashing people with headbutts,

7513
03:21:23,740 --> 03:21:24,670
no gloves.

7514
03:21:24,790 --> 03:21:28,480
And this is the Mark Coleman error and
this is the era where v tour is coming

7515
03:21:28,481 --> 03:21:29,170
up.

7516
03:21:29,170 --> 03:21:32,140
So [inaudible] gets to
like 240 pounds at fights.

7517
03:21:32,141 --> 03:21:34,240
Randy and Randy survives.

7518
03:21:34,241 --> 03:21:37,510
The opening barrage really doesn't even
get hit with much and just starts to

7519
03:21:37,511 --> 03:21:40,990
slowly chip away at detour until
he gets him up against cage.

7520
03:21:40,991 --> 03:21:44,770
Beats him up and get some down and
smashes him and everybody was in shock.

7521
03:21:44,960 --> 03:21:45,591
Everybody was like,

7522
03:21:45,591 --> 03:21:46,424
what?

7523
03:21:46,880 --> 03:21:48,020
How did he lose?

7524
03:21:48,140 --> 03:21:50,630
How's it possible and how
did he lose like this?

7525
03:21:50,631 --> 03:21:55,520
It was a really important fight in MMA
because it was a fight where you have a

7526
03:21:55,521 --> 03:21:59,780
narrative that you think is playing
out and then a lesson gets taught to

7527
03:21:59,781 --> 03:22:00,400
everybody like,

7528
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:00,531
no,

7529
03:22:00,531 --> 03:22:00,620
no,

7530
03:22:00,620 --> 03:22:00,990
no,

7531
03:22:00,990 --> 03:22:01,350
you,

7532
03:22:01,350 --> 03:22:02,330
you got too big.

7533
03:22:02,360 --> 03:22:04,520
This is all muscle that you don't need.

7534
03:22:04,550 --> 03:22:05,480
It doesn't help you.

7535
03:22:05,660 --> 03:22:06,740
You get tired.

7536
03:22:06,860 --> 03:22:08,420
You need to have better endurance.

7537
03:22:08,540 --> 03:22:09,850
This is not the way you,

7538
03:22:09,851 --> 03:22:10,071
you know,

7539
03:22:10,071 --> 03:22:13,280
you fight against a guy who can survive
and we didn't know that yet because

7540
03:22:13,281 --> 03:22:16,140
nobody knew that there was
going to be people who survived.

7541
03:22:16,150 --> 03:22:16,400
Yeah.

7542
03:22:16,400 --> 03:22:17,001
Nobody knew this.

7543
03:22:17,001 --> 03:22:18,590
We going to be people
with submission defense.

7544
03:22:18,591 --> 03:22:19,610
When people are caught and submissions,

7545
03:22:19,611 --> 03:22:20,740
they tapped it'll,

7546
03:22:20,750 --> 03:22:22,820
how often did anybody get it
out of anything back then?

7547
03:22:23,030 --> 03:22:23,691
Like we know one,

7548
03:22:23,691 --> 03:22:25,940
he knew the progression
that it was going to take.

7549
03:22:26,070 --> 03:22:28,160
We learned in that Randy
fight that there's,

7550
03:22:28,430 --> 03:22:30,440
there's a certain level of winner.

7551
03:22:30,650 --> 03:22:31,730
There's guys that just,

7552
03:22:31,790 --> 03:22:33,860
they're fucking mental animals.

7553
03:22:33,950 --> 03:22:35,390
They just know how to win.

7554
03:22:35,391 --> 03:22:38,300
They know how to break people
and you get to see that in Randy.

7555
03:22:39,890 --> 03:22:40,230
Man.

7556
03:22:40,230 --> 03:22:40,990
It's sweet.

7557
03:22:40,990 --> 03:22:41,751
It's crazy.

7558
03:22:41,751 --> 03:22:42,460
Like,

7559
03:22:42,460 --> 03:22:46,220
and then everyone thought all the
Machida era and there's really,

7560
03:22:46,250 --> 03:22:46,671
that was me,

7561
03:22:46,671 --> 03:22:47,504
I said,

7562
03:22:47,590 --> 03:22:48,680
but the smarter we get,

7563
03:22:48,681 --> 03:22:49,160
the real,

7564
03:22:49,160 --> 03:22:50,300
there's no going to be an error.

7565
03:22:50,330 --> 03:22:52,130
But then you wonder what John Jones,

7566
03:22:52,160 --> 03:22:52,371
well,

7567
03:22:52,371 --> 03:22:54,170
there's a John Jones air right now.

7568
03:22:54,200 --> 03:22:54,381
I mean,

7569
03:22:54,381 --> 03:22:55,670
this is the John Jones era.

7570
03:22:55,700 --> 03:22:56,690
No question about it.

7571
03:22:56,720 --> 03:22:58,880
If you look at the
actual results in fights,

7572
03:22:58,910 --> 03:23:00,890
I don't care what they
say about anything else.

7573
03:23:00,920 --> 03:23:02,270
This is what people are gonna remember.

7574
03:23:02,480 --> 03:23:05,750
When you go back and look at
this era of light heavyweights,

7575
03:23:05,751 --> 03:23:07,160
you think about Jon Jones.

7576
03:23:07,340 --> 03:23:10,310
It's just like when Muhammad
Ali was in his prime,

7577
03:23:10,311 --> 03:23:13,700
people thought about Ali when sugar ray
Leonard was a welterweight champion.

7578
03:23:13,701 --> 03:23:14,540
People thought about sugar.

7579
03:23:14,541 --> 03:23:15,020
Ray,

7580
03:23:15,020 --> 03:23:16,280
you got to think about Jon Jones.

7581
03:23:16,310 --> 03:23:17,740
It's definitely the Jon Jones era,

7582
03:23:18,260 --> 03:23:21,550
but it's just an error of so
much turmoil and you know,

7583
03:23:21,560 --> 03:23:26,560
you want to talk about a guy who had
more potential than probably anybody I've

7584
03:23:26,780 --> 03:23:28,940
ever seen fight and anybody.

7585
03:23:29,000 --> 03:23:29,810
Yeah,

7586
03:23:29,810 --> 03:23:32,960
and John Does the same kind of shit
that you were telling me that you do.

7587
03:23:33,310 --> 03:23:34,850
He just makes things
up while he's in there.

7588
03:23:34,851 --> 03:23:36,200
Just sees things and goes with it.

7589
03:23:36,530 --> 03:23:39,500
Like that thing that he did with
glow over that over hook or yanked,

7590
03:23:39,501 --> 03:23:41,060
I shoulder's fucked of a shoulder.

7591
03:23:41,061 --> 03:23:41,930
Gracie luck.

7592
03:23:41,990 --> 03:23:42,201
Yeah.

7593
03:23:42,201 --> 03:23:42,470
I mean,

7594
03:23:42,470 --> 03:23:44,240
I don't know if he ever did
that in the past before,

7595
03:23:44,241 --> 03:23:47,020
but it didn't look like it looked like
you probably just saw it right there and

7596
03:23:47,021 --> 03:23:50,570
so let me just yank on this
fuck up is fuck up his shoulder.

7597
03:23:51,260 --> 03:23:52,490
John would do crazy shit.

7598
03:23:52,491 --> 03:23:54,590
Spinning elbows and all that.

7599
03:23:54,680 --> 03:23:55,100
I mean,

7600
03:23:55,100 --> 03:23:55,671
he's just,

7601
03:23:55,671 --> 03:23:58,910
he knows how to be loose in there and
knows that he knows how to do things.

7602
03:23:59,030 --> 03:23:59,300
I wonder.

7603
03:23:59,300 --> 03:23:59,850
Steep Age,

7604
03:23:59,850 --> 03:24:00,500
John Mackey,

7605
03:24:00,500 --> 03:24:01,333
if you're seeing that,

7606
03:24:01,940 --> 03:24:03,170
I can't believe we're
going to see Steve Bay.

7607
03:24:03,171 --> 03:24:04,460
DC can't believe it either.

7608
03:24:05,720 --> 03:24:06,740
I can't believe it.

7609
03:24:06,910 --> 03:24:10,300
The live raising more jack for
that flight than any Brian or take,

7610
03:24:10,320 --> 03:24:11,153
correct.

7611
03:24:11,370 --> 03:24:11,730
Oh,

7612
03:24:11,730 --> 03:24:12,171
that's right.

7613
03:24:12,171 --> 03:24:13,340
That's the Vegas card.

7614
03:24:13,790 --> 03:24:15,200
That is a crazy fight.

7615
03:24:15,230 --> 03:24:16,063
Who Wins?

7616
03:24:16,460 --> 03:24:21,380
Steve Bay and DC is very interesting
because the last time that we saw steep a

7617
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:26,680
in like a fight with a really
high level wrestler was who?

7618
03:24:27,700 --> 03:24:28,370
Who was that?

7619
03:24:28,370 --> 03:24:31,820
Who was the last fight where Steve Bay
fought someone who really knew how to

7620
03:24:31,821 --> 03:24:32,654
wrestle?

7621
03:24:32,990 --> 03:24:33,780
Who's it been?

7622
03:24:33,780 --> 03:24:34,910
I'm trying to think.

7623
03:24:36,740 --> 03:24:36,921
Well,

7624
03:24:36,921 --> 03:24:38,150
he's fought tough guys.

7625
03:24:38,151 --> 03:24:38,511
He fought.

7626
03:24:38,511 --> 03:24:39,170
Mark Hon.

7627
03:24:39,170 --> 03:24:40,060
If our junior,

7628
03:24:40,061 --> 03:24:43,000
it was much more of a boxer briefs.

7629
03:24:43,320 --> 03:24:44,153
Shoot.

7630
03:24:44,190 --> 03:24:44,431
Yeah.

7631
03:24:44,431 --> 03:24:46,270
Fabricio didn't mean
mean free per receive.

7632
03:24:46,271 --> 03:24:47,370
Your attack coming in.

7633
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:50,220
So who is like the toughest
wrestler he fought?

7634
03:24:50,670 --> 03:24:52,470
If you go back a little bit further,

7635
03:24:52,500 --> 03:24:53,333
let's see,

7636
03:24:54,450 --> 03:24:58,070
really Nelson Roy Nelson
didn't really keys.

7637
03:24:58,130 --> 03:24:59,000
I mean Roy Nelson,

7638
03:24:59,180 --> 03:25:00,020
let's be honest.

7639
03:25:00,050 --> 03:25:01,970
Roy Nelson could fight middleweight,

7640
03:25:03,170 --> 03:25:03,720
right?

7641
03:25:03,720 --> 03:25:04,100
Yeah.

7642
03:25:04,100 --> 03:25:05,090
He's just an animal.

7643
03:25:05,570 --> 03:25:06,830
If he wanted to lose that gut,

7644
03:25:06,860 --> 03:25:07,790
how much would he lose?

7645
03:25:07,820 --> 03:25:08,750
Holy smokes,

7646
03:25:08,751 --> 03:25:09,020
dude.

7647
03:25:09,020 --> 03:25:10,880
He's probably walking
around about two 50 right.

7648
03:25:10,910 --> 03:25:12,080
But that giant crazy belly.

7649
03:25:12,110 --> 03:25:12,890
My height,

7650
03:25:12,890 --> 03:25:14,390
which is part of his trademark.

7651
03:25:14,730 --> 03:25:15,470
Right.

7652
03:25:15,470 --> 03:25:20,470
But if he decided to cut weight and just
go on some crazy diet and cut out all

7653
03:25:21,231 --> 03:25:23,750
the bullshit and drain all the fat,

7654
03:25:24,980 --> 03:25:25,970
what do you think he would way?

7655
03:25:26,150 --> 03:25:28,430
I think you make one 85 easily.

7656
03:25:28,431 --> 03:25:28,811
One eight,

7657
03:25:28,811 --> 03:25:29,420
five dude.

7658
03:25:29,420 --> 03:25:29,841
Easily.

7659
03:25:29,841 --> 03:25:30,674
Right?

7660
03:25:30,850 --> 03:25:31,683
That's crazy.

7661
03:25:32,780 --> 03:25:33,620
Whoa man.

7662
03:25:34,970 --> 03:25:37,040
The thing is like Steve Bay's a wrestler,

7663
03:25:37,041 --> 03:25:39,210
he's knows what he needs to do and like,

7664
03:25:39,450 --> 03:25:40,020
yeah,

7665
03:25:40,020 --> 03:25:40,880
going to find out,

7666
03:25:40,881 --> 03:25:41,060
man,

7667
03:25:41,060 --> 03:25:42,500
he is a wrestler for sure,

7668
03:25:42,530 --> 03:25:47,060
but he's not the same caliber of
wrestler that Daniel Cormier is.

7669
03:25:47,300 --> 03:25:51,680
But Daniel Cormier is a legit light
heavyweight who has fought successfully at

7670
03:25:51,681 --> 03:25:52,790
heavyweight and never lost it.

7671
03:25:52,791 --> 03:25:53,241
Heavyweight.

7672
03:25:53,241 --> 03:25:53,540
Yep.

7673
03:25:53,540 --> 03:25:56,720
So it makes it real
interesting because Daniel,

7674
03:25:56,760 --> 03:25:57,050
look,

7675
03:25:57,050 --> 03:25:57,441
Daniel,

7676
03:25:57,441 --> 03:26:00,230
remember when he fought Josh Barnett and
fucking set up sailing through the air?

7677
03:26:00,470 --> 03:26:03,820
Josh is a big fella and that
fucker can grapple today.

7678
03:26:03,830 --> 03:26:04,663
He can grapple.

7679
03:26:04,730 --> 03:26:06,080
He really knows how to grapple.

7680
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:06,690
Damion,

7681
03:26:06,690 --> 03:26:07,011
that's a,

7682
03:26:07,011 --> 03:26:08,740
that's a big fucking tall.

7683
03:26:09,140 --> 03:26:10,600
I forgot Francis and who?

7684
03:26:10,610 --> 03:26:11,443
Derrick Lewis.

7685
03:26:16,310 --> 03:26:17,420
Don't blink.

7686
03:26:17,710 --> 03:26:22,160
Xtrordinair Holy Shit Dude.

7687
03:26:22,400 --> 03:26:23,920
Big dairies one way and fight.

7688
03:26:23,990 --> 03:26:24,650
You think so?

7689
03:26:24,650 --> 03:26:25,490
I think though,

7690
03:26:25,491 --> 03:26:26,324
Jesus,

7691
03:26:26,510 --> 03:26:29,120
how the fuck would you anybody
know who's gonna win that fight?

7692
03:26:29,490 --> 03:26:30,540
KITSAP pedis.

7693
03:26:30,880 --> 03:26:33,460
Paulo Kosta and Uriah Hall.

7694
03:26:33,490 --> 03:26:34,210
Oh,

7695
03:26:34,210 --> 03:26:34,991
what our card.

7696
03:26:34,991 --> 03:26:35,750
This is,

7697
03:26:35,750 --> 03:26:38,030
I imagine Paulo coasters of beast.

7698
03:26:38,060 --> 03:26:40,610
Imagine the lawsuit chaos
has got going right now.

7699
03:26:40,970 --> 03:26:43,760
I know because I heard that they were
going to give him the Habib fight.

7700
03:26:44,280 --> 03:26:45,330
Oh my God.

7701
03:26:46,140 --> 03:26:47,130
Oh my God.

7702
03:26:48,140 --> 03:26:49,010
That's terrible.

7703
03:26:49,030 --> 03:26:49,761
They were so,

7704
03:26:49,761 --> 03:26:50,900
who knows what could have happened?

7705
03:26:50,901 --> 03:26:51,890
He upsets Habib.

7706
03:26:51,891 --> 03:26:52,431
He gets a fight.

7707
03:26:52,431 --> 03:26:52,731
Conor,

7708
03:26:52,731 --> 03:26:57,731
who knows to pull out so well Chechen
just shake up the cash register and let's

7709
03:27:01,671 --> 03:27:02,241
clean this up.

7710
03:27:02,241 --> 03:27:03,050
Mr. Gregory.

7711
03:27:03,050 --> 03:27:06,470
Fuck all you have to do a sign right here.

7712
03:27:07,040 --> 03:27:08,150
I taught at line.

7713
03:27:09,500 --> 03:27:10,850
Well hold on.

7714
03:27:10,851 --> 03:27:12,320
Go back to that other card real quick.

7715
03:27:12,321 --> 03:27:12,920
We aren't done.

7716
03:27:12,920 --> 03:27:14,000
There's still a few in that card.

7717
03:27:15,740 --> 03:27:16,390
Ooh.

7718
03:27:16,390 --> 03:27:18,970
So key asset versus
pedis is very exciting.

7719
03:27:19,030 --> 03:27:19,330
Yeah.

7720
03:27:19,330 --> 03:27:20,260
How about this though?

7721
03:27:20,290 --> 03:27:23,170
Go [inaudible] back in
the motherfucking mass.

7722
03:27:23,940 --> 03:27:26,110
Kahlil Roundtree junior who was obese too.

7723
03:27:26,140 --> 03:27:28,540
That's a fucking crazy wild ass fight.

7724
03:27:28,740 --> 03:27:31,120
Hooker verse Burns Dude fight there.

7725
03:27:31,600 --> 03:27:32,560
It's fun to watch.

7726
03:27:32,670 --> 03:27:34,420
He is fun to watch over ton animal.

7727
03:27:34,450 --> 03:27:34,661
Yeah.

7728
03:27:34,661 --> 03:27:35,441
That's a very,

7729
03:27:35,441 --> 03:27:36,274
very good fight.

7730
03:27:36,340 --> 03:27:39,670
Very good fight will
hooker is really long,

7731
03:27:39,671 --> 03:27:40,480
man.

7732
03:27:40,480 --> 03:27:43,220
Real but real physically
strong for that way.

7733
03:27:43,221 --> 03:27:44,060
Class to man.

7734
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:45,910
Not just long but fuck man.

7735
03:27:45,940 --> 03:27:47,140
And he believes in those knees.

7736
03:27:47,310 --> 03:27:48,143
Doesn't

7737
03:27:49,250 --> 03:27:50,083
fuck with that guy.

7738
03:27:50,110 --> 03:27:50,943
Jim Miller,

7739
03:27:51,690 --> 03:27:52,523
who is the other one?

7740
03:27:53,260 --> 03:27:54,093
Ross Pearson.

7741
03:27:54,150 --> 03:27:56,560
Pearson that and he was so nasty.

7742
03:27:57,310 --> 03:27:58,143
Nasty.

7743
03:27:58,300 --> 03:27:59,080
Very nasty.

7744
03:27:59,080 --> 03:27:59,291
Yeah.

7745
03:27:59,291 --> 03:28:00,580
That's a great card man.

7746
03:28:00,640 --> 03:28:01,473
Man.

7747
03:28:01,580 --> 03:28:04,150
Rafael has sunset sail versus rob font.

7748
03:28:04,180 --> 03:28:05,530
That's a great fight too.

7749
03:28:05,531 --> 03:28:07,000
That's a sleeper too.

7750
03:28:07,030 --> 03:28:08,520
There's some good strikers on that.

7751
03:28:08,530 --> 03:28:12,220
[inaudible] was the last guy to beat
TJ before Dominick Cruz beat him.

7752
03:28:13,410 --> 03:28:13,600
What?

7753
03:28:13,600 --> 03:28:15,700
Did he beat him or was
it like a split decision?

7754
03:28:15,730 --> 03:28:17,770
You look at the record and you're like,

7755
03:28:17,771 --> 03:28:18,580
Holy Shit,

7756
03:28:18,580 --> 03:28:20,300
I feel like a sun south made,

7757
03:28:20,440 --> 03:28:22,300
I think it was maybe wrong.

7758
03:28:22,810 --> 03:28:27,700
Tj Dillashaw then the unanimous
decision loss says so I'm wrong.

7759
03:28:27,730 --> 03:28:28,440
Beat Marlen.

7760
03:28:28,440 --> 03:28:28,561
No,

7761
03:28:28,561 --> 03:28:28,631
no,

7762
03:28:28,631 --> 03:28:28,930
no,

7763
03:28:28,930 --> 03:28:29,201
no,

7764
03:28:29,201 --> 03:28:29,381
no.

7765
03:28:29,381 --> 03:28:31,750
That's UFC 200 they fought before that.

7766
03:28:32,410 --> 03:28:33,160
They fought before.

7767
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:33,650
Yeah.

7768
03:28:33,650 --> 03:28:34,300
He beat him.

7769
03:28:34,300 --> 03:28:34,780
Yeah.

7770
03:28:34,780 --> 03:28:35,730
Halfway all suns out.

7771
03:28:35,731 --> 03:28:36,610
Brian Caraway,

7772
03:28:36,611 --> 03:28:37,540
Tj silicide.

7773
03:28:37,541 --> 03:28:38,041
Three dots.

7774
03:28:38,041 --> 03:28:38,980
Split decision.

7775
03:28:39,150 --> 03:28:39,820
So he want,

7776
03:28:39,820 --> 03:28:40,061
yeah,

7777
03:28:40,061 --> 03:28:40,894
that's what it was.

7778
03:28:41,080 --> 03:28:46,080
So he wants to put decision way back in
2013 and then Tj beat him in 2017 is I

7779
03:28:47,681 --> 03:28:47,801
would,

7780
03:28:47,801 --> 03:28:49,900
it was 16 TJ.

7781
03:28:50,140 --> 03:28:51,760
Well it's Tj just got a lot better.

7782
03:28:51,930 --> 03:28:52,390
Oh yeah,

7783
03:28:52,390 --> 03:28:53,223
he's a lot better.

7784
03:28:53,800 --> 03:28:57,370
What do you think about him
possibly moving to light
with two a flyweight that's

7785
03:28:57,371 --> 03:28:58,204
crazy,

7786
03:28:58,480 --> 03:28:58,781
man.

7787
03:28:58,781 --> 03:28:59,650
I don't know why he would want,

7788
03:28:59,651 --> 03:29:00,880
I don't want to fight Dj.

7789
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:01,713
That makes sense.

7790
03:29:03,000 --> 03:29:05,980
I opened up that cash register baby.

7791
03:29:06,950 --> 03:29:10,300
What Demetrius is thinking
Cha Ching like fuck,

7792
03:29:10,301 --> 03:29:11,590
I hope he's thinking Cha Ching.

7793
03:29:11,650 --> 03:29:11,861
Yeah,

7794
03:29:11,861 --> 03:29:12,520
no shit.

7795
03:29:12,520 --> 03:29:15,530
I hope he realizes that that
is a legitimate super fight.

7796
03:29:15,550 --> 03:29:17,440
If they can prove all
that shit in advance.

7797
03:29:17,680 --> 03:29:17,921
Look,

7798
03:29:17,921 --> 03:29:18,754
mighty mouse.

7799
03:29:18,940 --> 03:29:23,350
I mean he's technically
for sure the and his,

7800
03:29:23,360 --> 03:29:23,740
his,

7801
03:29:23,740 --> 03:29:24,311
his ability.

7802
03:29:24,311 --> 03:29:25,144
He's the best.

7803
03:29:25,480 --> 03:29:26,530
He's the best I've ever seen.

7804
03:29:26,830 --> 03:29:30,280
But TJ is the scariest guy
that he's ever had a fight.

7805
03:29:30,490 --> 03:29:31,000
Man.

7806
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:35,680
Tj goes down to one 25 if he
could do it and be healthy.

7807
03:29:35,681 --> 03:29:36,461
He's a scariest guy.

7808
03:29:36,461 --> 03:29:41,230
Mighty mouse is ever fought cause he's
a legit knockout artist at 35 he's super

7809
03:29:41,231 --> 03:29:41,711
fast.

7810
03:29:41,711 --> 03:29:42,521
He's sneaky,

7811
03:29:42,521 --> 03:29:43,510
he's technical.

7812
03:29:44,130 --> 03:29:45,070
He can wrestle.

7813
03:29:45,220 --> 03:29:46,570
He's a real good wrestler.

7814
03:29:46,750 --> 03:29:51,130
He's got a hundred percent legit knockout
power at 35 what is it going to have

7815
03:29:51,131 --> 03:29:52,750
at 25 you know,

7816
03:29:52,780 --> 03:29:53,021
I mean,

7817
03:29:53,021 --> 03:29:56,470
TJ might be a monster at
25 he can really make it.

7818
03:29:57,070 --> 03:29:58,150
That is a crazy,

7819
03:29:58,151 --> 03:29:58,781
crazy fight.

7820
03:29:58,781 --> 03:29:59,740
I love that fight.

7821
03:29:59,810 --> 03:30:02,250
Nobody walks around that because
I'm the right cut the 25 one time.

7822
03:30:02,251 --> 03:30:03,700
I did not feel like I had power.

7823
03:30:04,560 --> 03:30:06,850
I thought one time at 25 and I felt worse.

7824
03:30:06,910 --> 03:30:07,421
I don't know.

7825
03:30:07,421 --> 03:30:08,620
He insists that he's done it.

7826
03:30:09,010 --> 03:30:10,390
He insists he can make it.

7827
03:30:10,520 --> 03:30:11,081
He's good to set.

7828
03:30:11,081 --> 03:30:11,381
I know.

7829
03:30:11,381 --> 03:30:12,214
I can make it.

7830
03:30:12,760 --> 03:30:14,530
He looks smaller than
he's looked in the past.

7831
03:30:14,830 --> 03:30:15,071
You know,

7832
03:30:15,071 --> 03:30:16,780
he might've been aiming towards it,

7833
03:30:16,830 --> 03:30:17,310
you know,

7834
03:30:17,310 --> 03:30:18,250
working towards it.

7835
03:30:19,090 --> 03:30:19,923
But uh,

7836
03:30:20,110 --> 03:30:21,820
I'm super excited about his rematch.

7837
03:30:21,860 --> 03:30:22,780
The Cody Garbrandt.

7838
03:30:23,740 --> 03:30:24,573
Whew.

7839
03:30:25,240 --> 03:30:26,470
That's a very intense,

7840
03:30:26,920 --> 03:30:27,910
that's an intense fight.

7841
03:30:28,090 --> 03:30:28,691
That first one.

7842
03:30:28,691 --> 03:30:30,040
But I mean,

7843
03:30:30,070 --> 03:30:30,701
don't forget,

7844
03:30:30,701 --> 03:30:33,790
Cody cracked him and dropped
him before Tj put them away.

7845
03:30:33,791 --> 03:30:34,001
I mean,

7846
03:30:34,001 --> 03:30:34,834
that was spicy.

7847
03:30:35,110 --> 03:30:36,100
It was awesome.

7848
03:30:36,120 --> 03:30:37,870
How some real intensity wasn't it?

7849
03:30:37,930 --> 03:30:38,741
Fuck yeah man.

7850
03:30:38,741 --> 03:30:40,340
Those were close

7851
03:30:40,400 --> 03:30:43,310
training partners and they probably
always knew that this was one day going to

7852
03:30:43,311 --> 03:30:44,144
go down.

7853
03:30:44,320 --> 03:30:45,070
Dale was,

7854
03:30:45,070 --> 03:30:47,540
Cody released that video
of him knocking out Tj.

7855
03:30:47,690 --> 03:30:47,811
Yeah,

7856
03:30:47,811 --> 03:30:49,010
but the thing is he didn't knock him out,

7857
03:30:49,220 --> 03:30:49,900
dropped him.

7858
03:30:49,900 --> 03:30:51,950
A teacher was yelling at
him right after traveler.

7859
03:30:52,040 --> 03:30:52,320
C'Mon,

7860
03:30:52,320 --> 03:30:53,360
C'mon motherfucker.

7861
03:30:53,660 --> 03:30:54,990
So it wasn't really a knockout,

7862
03:30:55,030 --> 03:30:55,280
right.

7863
03:30:55,280 --> 03:30:57,380
It was basically the same thing
that happened in their fight.

7864
03:30:57,381 --> 03:31:01,750
And TJ wound up when I knock out
really was it was a flash knockdown.

7865
03:31:03,100 --> 03:31:04,250
They're both animals though.

7866
03:31:04,450 --> 03:31:05,420
I took good right there,

7867
03:31:05,421 --> 03:31:05,930
dude.

7868
03:31:05,930 --> 03:31:06,201
That's,

7869
03:31:06,201 --> 03:31:08,420
and you know Cody's going to
be helped bent on revenge.

7870
03:31:08,990 --> 03:31:09,321
Oh yeah.

7871
03:31:09,321 --> 03:31:10,520
That's going to be a good build up.

7872
03:31:10,700 --> 03:31:11,630
Fuck yeah man.

7873
03:31:11,960 --> 03:31:15,520
See if Cody comes back
or the same or you know,

7874
03:31:15,590 --> 03:31:16,340
who knows?

7875
03:31:16,340 --> 03:31:17,173
Who knows?

7876
03:31:18,050 --> 03:31:18,530
Yeah,

7877
03:31:18,530 --> 03:31:19,210
it's August,

7878
03:31:19,210 --> 03:31:20,660
August 4th all right dude,

7879
03:31:20,930 --> 03:31:23,210
it's already five 30
let's wrap this pitch up.

7880
03:31:23,440 --> 03:31:24,380
It's a long time,

7881
03:31:24,560 --> 03:31:25,760

7882

7884
03:31:27,950 --> 03:31:28,610
I enjoyed it.

7885
03:31:28,610 --> 03:31:29,331
I enjoyed it a lot,

7886
03:31:29,331 --> 03:31:29,660
man.

7887
03:31:29,660 --> 03:31:29,900
Yeah,

7888
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:30,201

7889
03:31:30,201 --> 03:31:31,034
This is always,

7890
03:31:31,040 --> 03:31:32,240
I've been watching you for a long time.

7891
03:31:32,241 --> 03:31:33,260
This is awesome.

7892
03:31:33,340 --> 03:31:33,940
Thanks man.

7893
03:31:33,940 --> 03:31:34,281
Like I said,

7894
03:31:34,281 --> 03:31:35,510
we look up to you a lot,

7895
03:31:35,511 --> 03:31:35,671

7896
03:31:35,671 --> 03:31:36,860
and we're thankful for everything.

7897
03:31:37,060 --> 03:31:37,220
Well,

7898
03:31:37,220 --> 03:31:37,881
I appreciate that,

7899
03:31:37,881 --> 03:31:38,810
but that makes me uncomfortable.

7900
03:31:38,811 --> 03:31:39,680
So don't say it anymore.

7901
03:31:42,540 --> 03:31:42,860
Look,

7902
03:31:42,860 --> 03:31:47,120
I'm just a lucky person that has a
weird job that allows me to talk to cool

7903
03:31:47,121 --> 03:31:47,600
people,

7904

from pizza when we enjoy.

7905
03:31:51,080 --> 03:31:52,970
And we learned to sweet
shit from you guys too.

7906
03:31:52,971 --> 03:31:53,660

All right.

7915
03:32:03,111 --> 03:32:03,710
Minus two.

7916
03:32:03,710 --> 03:32:04,220
That's it.
