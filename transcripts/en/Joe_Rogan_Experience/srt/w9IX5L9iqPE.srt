1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,590
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,070
Yeah.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,070
I taught fourth grade and now those
kids are grown up and that's really cool

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,930
because some of them told me it
was the best year of their lives.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,580
They come to see me do stand up.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,331
Oh,

7
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:12,991
that's amazing.

8
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,411
Very cool.

9
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:17,430
Will you teach and what worth it took
everything but fourth grade is different

10
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,211
than science.

11
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:18,900
Everything.

12
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,171
I mean,

13
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:19,381
yeah,

14
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:23,670
it's different than what you did because
you went to people who had an interest

15
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:27,600
and a love for something and wanted
to explore it what you were doing.

16
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,530
But mine is different.

17
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,370
They had to be there.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,890
So my thing was self doubt,

19
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:32,724
self esteem.

20
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,260
I figured I can't teach them.

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
These subjects are going to
come and go in their lives,

22
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,720
but teaching them self esteem and some
of the most rewarding things were like

23
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,951
had this one kid,

24
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:41,680
he was real shy,

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,513
so shy.

26
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,320
He was real tall and he was embarrassed
by it and he would stay in the.

27
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,040
In the cloak room,

28
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,420
they'd call it a,

29
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,800
you know,

30
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,370
we're all the coats and
you just stay in there.

31
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:51,811
It will come out.

32
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:52,240
I go,

33
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,760
Sky Come,

34
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,860
Sky King because he was
a space cadet goes sky,

35
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:56,700
you got to come out,

36
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
they can't stay,

37
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,120
I can't let a kid just sit and,

38
00:00:59,121 --> 00:00:59,880
you know,

39
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,880
and by the end of me just like
work in his self esteem and all,

40
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,690
he was in the middle of the class,

41
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,680
just what everybody else waving his hand
and his mother came up to me and she

42
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:14,570
was like really touched by it and
told me that I changed his life and,

43
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:14,920
and you know,

44
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,990
that kind of Shit's cool.

45
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,930
And now I got like a couple of the
girls come to see me and she goes,

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,033
one of the girls goes,

47
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,580
uh,

48
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:20,951
ms.dot,

49
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:21,031
dot,

50
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,131
dot,

51
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:21,350
dot dot.

52
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,640
Why did you let us do so much stuff?

53
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,851
You know,

54
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,870
like I said,

55
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:26,340
because you were smarter than me.

56
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,271
I said,

57
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:27,721
she got to me.

58
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,021
I said,

59
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,261
look,

60
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:28,500
you know,

61
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,740
I,

62
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,520
I had more knowledge
because I was an adult.

63
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,070
But you know,

64
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,400
kids,

65
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,120
lot of you have more brainpower to me.

66
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:33,920
Maybe.

67
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,380
I know I wasn't smart enough
to know that I wasn't,

68
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,910
that's why you ran the class.

69
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:39,880
You know what I mean?

70
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
So you were an easy teacher.

71
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:42,420
That's what he talks easy.

72
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,310
I told them at the beginning of the year,

73
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:44,581
I said,

74
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:44,820
look,

75
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,070
I want this to be the most
fun year of your life.

76
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,690
Only you can mess it up.

77
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,090
Fucking awesome opportunity.

78
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:51,730
That must have been.

79
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,171
And I said,

80
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,280
I want to go to the gym.

81
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:53,581
This is one.

82
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,510
I was playing basketball.

83
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:54,781
I said,

84
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,160
I want to go to the gym more than you do,

85
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,890
so we're going to have a party.

86
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,410
Every Friday afternoon we'd have.

87
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:05,040
We'd have like kids that would do
break dancing and stuff and really?

88
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,720
Yeah.

89
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,570
That's awesome.

90
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,404
That was great.

91
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,740
Did you ever try to pitch
that as a sitcom a no,

92
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,790
but somebody else had an idea for a
couple of times with be hilarious Sitcom.

93
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,840
It seems like a natural.

94
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,470
Yeah.

95
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,370
You as a.

96
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,040
As a a funny teacher
because you really did it.

97
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,800
It's legit and if you really
stop and think about it,

98
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,400
that would be like for a kid that's like
one of the greatest rolls of the dice

99
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:28,140
have kicked and get for
their fourth grade teacher.

100
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,200
I had a girl for your
fourth grade teacher.

101
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,600
She still calls me Mr Herrera.

102
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,130
She was 26 years old or whatever.

103
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,000
He calls me Mr Herrera.

104
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,940
Right.

105
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,770
And I go,

106
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,290
Theresa,

107
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,681
first of all,

108
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,670
you're taller than me.

109
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,770
She's always hot blonde.

110
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,180
I go start with the Mr.
you can call me dumb.

111
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:48,590
She because I just
can't call you dumb net.

112
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,200
Funny.

113
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
She's got got me down as Mr Herrera.

114
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
That's good.

115
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
That'll keep you from being a dirty bird.

116
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:54,900
Whoa,

117
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,290
Whoa,

118
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,110
whoa.

119
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,100
Stay away dog.

120
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,710
She's a little girl.

121
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,531
Let her talk call you.

122
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,200
Ms Dot Darwish.

123
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Trying to establish boundaries.

124
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,961
Somebody said,

125
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,310
why do you feel young?

126
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:03,740
I go,

127
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,260
because I can come on.

128
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Do you think that becoming more
aware or reaching a higher state of

129
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,100
consciousness because of your experiences
will actually help you because it'll

130
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:19,990
abandoned a lot of the distractions
that you present yourself almost

131
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,824
unknowingly.

132
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,131
Yeah.

133
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,940
Well,

134
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,571
it helps me.

135
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:26,260
It helps me in training and particularly
when I'm running now because I used to

136
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:31,261
listen to like Pantera and disorder when
I was running and I worked myself into

137
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,570
like a rage so I would
run into exhaustion.

138
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,240
That was kinda how I trained and I
trained all the way through my career like

139
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,710
that and the last couple of fights,

140
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,311
so sweet stuff.

141
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,370
I listened to a lot more like,

142
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:43,930
like more like buying binaural beat type
of stuff when I'm running so I could

143
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,340
get into more like a meditative stage,

144
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,243
you know,

145
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,320
doing a lot of yoga as well and trying
to find the same thing where you just,

146
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:50,830
you,

147
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,150
you,

148
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,470
you,

149
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,770
you're within yourself and you're
not focusing on anything else.

150
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,810
So your body's almost like on autopilot.

151
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,581
Yeah.

152
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,581
That the music that you listened to when
you train can have a profound effect on

153
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:03,791
my approach.

154
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,360
Your training.

155
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Yeah.

156
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,633
It really can.

157
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,800
It's so important and that's why I've
always been so vocal about all this stuff

158
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,290
I listen to like I'd like
training camp playlist,

159
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,550
so I tweet everyday trump songs I was
listening to and that kind of thing is

160
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,150
important.

161
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,311
And,

162
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:16,471
and,

163
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:17,560
and the other thing as well,

164
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,610
like earlier on in my career,

165
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,590
I would use music to anchor feelings.

166
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,820
So like,

167
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,110
like,

168
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,420
uh,

169
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,970
when I fought Ludwig I used
the song called Ian by Woodkid,

170
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,450
which was the first time I'd switched
it from Angola belongs to me for like,

171
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,960
you know,

172
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,920
a bunch of fives.

173
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,353
Um,

174
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,930
so like for the 12 weeks of that
fight I was training with Frank Mir,

175
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,810
we were going up to read it,

176
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:39,090
it's up to Mount Charleston and now into
red rock and like doing hill running

177
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,580
and stuff.

178
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,230
And we had some real tough sessions.

179
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:41,560
I mean,

180
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:41,920
you know,

181
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,220
we're ready to put ourselves through for
that training camp and as soon as I got

182
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:45,851
back in my truck,

183
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,481
after the session,

184
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,111
after the session,

185
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,440
if I felt like it was a good session
that was productive and I felt positive,

186
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,160
I would put that song on and I would
say I would constantly connect those

187
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,750
feelings to that song.

188
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,930
So then when,

189
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,980
when I'm walking out and that song
comes on immediately I get that feeling

190
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,610
again.

191
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,030
Huh.

192
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,660
You know?

193
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,330
And it's just like,

194
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,560
you know,

195
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,700
just like when you listen to a sermon,

196
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,260
you think of a person like,

197
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:05,441
oh,

198
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:08,470
I heard that someone was with that
person and you made that connection

199
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:09,160
immediately.

200
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,870
But you can also train yourself to do it.

201
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:11,890
Yes.

202
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,050
That's why you like allison
to Cypress Hill now.

203
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,760
And it will take me back to fighting
in cage warriors like back in 2006.

204
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,690
Wow.

205
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,440
And I have songs all the way through like
that and now I don't listen to because

206
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,090
it was like my first two fights.

207
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,140
I came back to Pantera,

208
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,640
drag the waters.

209
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,880
By the time I got to the cage I was so
wound up and so angry that I was just run

210
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,020
out of gas immediately.

211
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,650
And now whenever I
listened to those songs,

212
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:40,330
I get that feeling of like exhaustion,

213
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,164
like ugh.

214
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
And I look at what's out there.

215
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,490
Some answers make no sense to me and
they seem to lead down really unhealthy

216
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:47,850
path.

217
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,690
So thank you.

218
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,553
But no thanks.

219
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,400
Are there answers?

220
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,430
Make more sense or maybe eight aunt
and like I'm happy with my own,

221
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,570
but as bad it really boiled down to the
but mostly researcher and experience,

222
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,050
a rejecting what is useless and absorb
what is useful and what specific or

223
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:03,501
you're on,

224
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:03,750
you know,

225
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,130
he's as you can make the dollar
tree for Alpha approach knowledge.

226
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,341
I mean,

227
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,720
he applied it to martial arts,

228
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,810
but he's a brilliant way of approach.

229
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,310
Just any kind of knowledge,

230
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,241
whether it's already.

231
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,074
It's about life.

232
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,601
Yeah.

233
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:17,830
That's hard for people to accept that.

234
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:18,100
Right.

235
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,550
It's um,

236
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,660
it's much easier to follow the pattern
that your family's from Holland.

237
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm a Lutheran because grandma's Lutheran
grandpa always said that no matter

238
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,201
what,

239
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:27,250
we will be Lutherans.

240
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:27,660
Yep.

241
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,380
I remember talking to this girl and uh,

242
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,140
she said that she was going
to get a tattoo of a cross.

243
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,041
And I said,

244
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:33,640
uh,

245
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,060
I said,

246
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:34,470
oh,

247
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:34,810
I go,

248
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,680
you're really religious.

249
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,250
She goes,

250
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,440
well,

251
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,971
not really,

252
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:37,804
but you know what?

253
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,900
I was born Catholic and I
figured out that no matter what,

254
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,970
that's the one thing that'll
be for the rest of my life.

255
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,230
What the fuck?

256
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,740
I mean,

257
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,150
and I remember saying I don't like,

258
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,781
you know,

259
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,650
I didn't know her very well,

260
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:48,160
so I was like,

261
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,993
okay,

262
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,800
um,

263
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,500
how do you know,

264
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,711
like,

265
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,390
how do you know you won't
change your mind about that?

266
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:52,780
She's like,

267
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,320
Oh my God,

268
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,280
my family would kill me.

269
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,801
And I was like,

270
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,131
oh,

271
00:06:59,131 --> 00:06:59,401
okay.

272
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,480
Well good luck with that.

273
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,250
Good luck with that.

274
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,243
Wow.

275
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,330
Yet at war,

276
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,530
war gone different.

277
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,251
There will be people.

278
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,760
Today's a really nasty,

279
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,450
but you know,

280
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,850
if I don't put the trust account,

281
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,713
my grandma would have.

282
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,020
Her feelings will get
really hurt and so it's,

283
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,350
I don't hate the Jews,

284
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,780
but grandma fucking hates
Jews and I love grandma know.

285
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,750
It's like I don't want to make them sad.

286
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,750
You know what's hilarious is that she
was going to get a Catholic tattoo in the

287
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:28,160
first place because like in the
Bible it very specifically says,

288
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,450
so like getting a religious
attitude was like,

289
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,781
well,

290
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:35,070
you're not listening to me.

291
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,860
No,

292
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,530
only what I listened when it's convenient,

293
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:39,750
but across tattoo is so sexy.

294
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,870
It makes me spiritual
and it thins out my back.

295
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,950
And that's the other point of the people
get peace when you are cutting you at

296
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:47,401
all and he's like,

297
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,540
what do you create your own?

298
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:48,990
It's not.

299
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,990
There are some absolute truths that fall
from heaven when they stop people that

300
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,010
are making up their own sheet anyway.

301
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,461
I mean,

302
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:59,080
when people say a full
time thing is bullshit,

303
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,960
they are making up their
own thing because they.

304
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:03,090
We'll add some powers
that they don't like.

305
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,610
They will focus on the day like and but
at the end that it's the one and only

306
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,500
interpretation and say if
you're going to do that,

307
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,350
might as well be honest and
just peek from any source.

308
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,640
If you're going to pick and choose.
