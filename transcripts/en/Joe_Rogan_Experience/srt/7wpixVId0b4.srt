1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,470
One of the few things I get nervous 
about,

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,710
not nervous,
but like,

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,420
oh,
what do I do here?

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,890
The start of every podcast.
It's like,

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,610
all right,
once we get off to the races,

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,200
we're all good.
Turn off your volume.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,110
I think that would be the second thing 
that you think.

8
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:25,600
Have you said it and right when you said
it,

9
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,640
the volume came on.
I'm pathetic.

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,640
It's not even funny anymore.
It's just sadness.

11
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:38,200
This podcast brought to you by hover.
If you go to hover.com

12
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:43,201
forward slash rogen,
you can get 10 percent off your domain 

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,760
name registrations plus a lot of stuff.
Hover provides for free,

14
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:51,060
like a who is privacy,
what hover is a company that's owned by 

15
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,660
the same folks that own ting and with 
the same sort of ethics behind them,

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,080
they just want to put together a cool 
website where you can buy a domain name 

17
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:06,481
fairly easily and do it all like 
ethically and have it set up now.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,530
Real simple,
easy,

19
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:11,020
intuitive.
I just used it the other day to register

20
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:16,021
some websites.
I'm just going to go on the porn 

21
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:16,021
business on.
Are you really?

22
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:16,150
Yeah,
not really,

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,360
no.
What am I doing?

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,010
Claymation porn skin.
I'm going to make like little fake 

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,350
things.
Fuck No.

26
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,050
Uh,
that's not what the website's for.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,610
I just had an idea,
but anyway,

28
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,920
it was easy to do,
super easy to go and register it.

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,210
And uh,
as I said,

30
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:33,220
if you go to hover.com
forward slash rogen,

31
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,550
you can save yourself 10 percent off.
Sweet Baby Jesus.

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,830
Look at this.
I looked@Dunkinlovesbabies.com

33
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:44,140
which is available and Duncan does love 
babies.

34
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,540
I love those little sweetie.
But then like it gives you,

35
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:51,541
like the other available domains that 
you can buy through hover and it just 

36
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,600
goes from Dunkins loves babies.net
to Chicago babies.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,580
But Chicago babies is $488.
Just don't try it.

38
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,660
Don't connect the dots here.
Let's just move on.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,480
Do you have a baby in Chicago?
Yeah,

40
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,800
I forget it.
Just move on.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,130
Dr [inaudible] been having babies.
What?

42
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,510
I love him,

43
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,650
just because you love them doesn't mean 
you have to have them.

44
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,470
That's it.
Go to a go to hover.com.

45
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:17,210
Forward Slash Joe.
As I said,

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,410
is that what it said is that you want,
I said what was the exact wording of it?

47
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:24,350
Hover.com.
Forward Slash rogen.

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:29,410
Sorry.
And you get 10 percent off your domain 

49
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:29,410
name registration.
So that's hover.com

50
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,130
forward slash rogen.
Uh,

51
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,560
we are also brought to you by 
[inaudible] dot com.

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,120
That's an n I t a done this commercial 
fucking billion times.

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,980
Um,
this,

54
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:41,720
uh,
what an honor it is,

55
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:46,610
a company that sells supplements to 
increase your performance,

56
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:51,380
whether it's cognitively,
whether it's physically.

57
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,350
There's a shroom tech sport,
which is an amazing,

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,560
amazing supplement that we put together.
It's from the quarter seps mushroom and 

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,190
the idea behind it is there certain 
plants like cordyceps,

60
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:08,191
mushroom being an excellent law,
but it's not really a plant because 

61
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:08,500
cordyceps mushroom is a crazy kind of 
fungus.

62
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,570
It's like a weird sort of a living 
thing.

63
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,620
It's closer to funguses or I believe I 
don't want to speak out of school,

64
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,090
but I believe they're closer to humans 
and plants is right.

65
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,400
True.
Yeah.

66
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,170
Well,
this quarter,

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,530
eps mushroom stuff,
uh,

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,250
the,
uh,

69
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:26,251
the first experimented it apparently 
when in high altitude hurting 

70
00:03:26,251 --> 00:03:28,000
communities,
they found that the cows are more active

71
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,080
after the ate these mushrooms and so 
they kind of put it together and the way

72
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:37,081
it's grown,
it's grown like on caterpillars or some 

73
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:40,291
shit.
It's like this really freaky fucking 

74
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:40,450
process to create.
But what it is,

75
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,570
is a,
it's an amazing endurance supplement.

76
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,810
It's a fantastic stuff.
It's like really obvious effect if you 

77
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:54,571
have like a brutal workout,
if you're going to go a do a spin class 

78
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:57,250
Duncan and get ferocious to some 
eighties music,

79
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,840
you know,
some fucking Pat Benatar and you're 

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:02,840
like,
yeah,

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:02,840
right.
Um,

82
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,880
it's just an excellent supplement for,
um,

83
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,720
for endurance.

84
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,860
Anybody's doing Jujitsu.
If you're doing kettlebells,

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
anything along those lines.
It's got a lot of [inaudible] in it as 

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,400
well.
Real noticeable effect.

87
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,810
Um,
Alpha brain is,

88
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:19,660
uh,
another supplement that we have that,

89
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,940
uh,
I swear by it,

90
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:25,941
I've been taking this shit forever,
but I've been taking nootropics forever 

91
00:04:25,941 --> 00:04:29,731
too.
I just think it only makes sense to me 

92
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:30,340
that if it's possible,
as long as I'm not starving as long as I

93
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,940
have money to buy supplements and if you
don't spend your money on healthy food,

94
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,570
but if you have the money,
I would always think that what,

95
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,520
what,
what is like really important?

96
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,350
Speed,
speed.

97
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,280
What is really important when one of the
things that's really important to me is 

98
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,250
the way my brain functions,
you know,

99
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:53,251
because I know it's variable.
I know there's a big difference between 

100
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:53,710
the way I am when I'm hung over.

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,610
There's a big difference between the way
I am when I'm jet lagged and when I'm in

102
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:02,611
the groove,
when I feel great and my words are 

103
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:03,430
flowing and conversations are going 
smoothly and you're in the middle of.

104
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,320
I don't know what the fuck causes that.
Okay.

105
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:07,210
I think it's a bunch of things.
I think it's rest,

106
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,730
but I also think it's health and I also 
think it's nutrition.

107
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,730
And my experience with,
uh,

108
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,670
started off with Bill Roman [inaudible] 
stuff.

109
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,270
It's called neuro one and he created 
that because he,

110
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,490
he got a bunch of concussions from 
playing football,

111
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,950
famous football player and um,
you know,

112
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:28,951
he was fighting against it and one of 
the things he did is try to improve the 

113
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:31,120
quality of his brain and improve the 
quality of the functioning of his mind.

114
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,110
So he started experimenting with various
nutrients that do that and uh,

115
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,540
and that's sorta where Alpha brain took 
it.

116
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,540
From there we just tried to put together
the best combination of what we know so 

117
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,970
far about these things.
And if you're not interested in it,

118
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,440
that's cool.
I understand.

119
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,740
If you are interested in it,
you can go and use the coordinate Rogan.

120
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:53,080
You can save 10 percent of any of the 
supplements.

121
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:58,081
This is all fairly controversial stuff 
with some people and that's one of the 

122
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:59,660
reasons why on it has a money back 
guarantee.

123
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:04,661
One hundred percent the first order of 
30 pills within the first 90 days you 

124
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:09,551
have 100 percent money back guarantee.
You don't even have to return the 

125
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:09,551
product to stay.
The sucks.

126
00:06:09,551 --> 00:06:14,420
Give me my money back.
Its because no one's trying to rip you 

127
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,141
off,
but just trying to sell you the best 

128
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:17,141
shit.
It's not a massive difference.

129
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:19,340
It's a subtle difference,
but I believe it's a real difference,

130
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:20,500
I think.
I think it improves,

131
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:23,510
it improves the quality of my thinking.
It sounds crazy,

132
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,870
but if you,
if you just google nootropic and o,

133
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,530
o t r o,
p,

134
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:31,520
I see you will see,
uh,

135
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:36,521
all the different studies and tests that
had been done on it and it's shown 

136
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,200
increases in memory and it's really 
fascinating stuff.

137
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,140
Um,
and very controversial as I sent.

138
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,760
So it's a fake,
but that's a real,

139
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,740
that's a fake really?
Oh yeah,

140
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,240
that's real.
Wow.

141
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,800
Yeah,
she's in shape.

142
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:49,730
She's,

143
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,800
she's on it.
Oh forgive me.

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,580
You know,
I've talked about this,

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,800
uh,
this supplement company so many times 

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:01,800
with so many podcasts that almost seems 
ridiculous,

147
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,250
but that's just something I believe in.
I believe in the ethics of the company.

148
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:10,251
I believe in the message.
I believe in trying to give people shit 

149
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:10,290
that makes your body work better.
I'm huge on that.

150
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:14,760
I think it's super important.
So I'm psyched to be working with them.

151
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:19,761
And again,
used code name Rogan save 10 percent of 

152
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:19,761
any of the supplement.

153
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:19,800
Is this Dr Lazar.
Who's this guy?

154
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,370
I don't know.

155
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,710
That's interesting.
That's A.

156
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:24,470
Oh,
that's heath haring.

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,790
Oh really?
Yeah.

158
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,791
He is a former UFC fighter,
former pride fighter legend MMA legend.

159
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,170
I think he's a pro poker player now.
Crazy,

160
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,360
crazy dude.
Wild Man.

161
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,010
Look,
there's an asteroid so it doesn't matter

162
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:37,350
because everyone's going to die from 
this aspect.

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,600
I think on it.
It's just saying listen to the hill 

164
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:42,600
pitch.
I don't know what the dream.

165
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,070
That's dope.
That's an Alpha brain induced serious.

166
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:46,780
Fuck.
Yeah,

167
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,700
it doesn't make sense.
Well look,

168
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:52,330
it's the whole company is like,
it's very cool.

169
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,460
It's a very cool company and you know,
one of the cool things about it is

170
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,640
they're like,
Aubrey is a young dude.

171
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:04,730
He's a very enthusiastic guy and 
occasionally they would

172
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,210
do things that are like just a little 
bit silly,

173
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,480
you know,
but it's not bad intentions,

174
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,230
you know,
he's,

175
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,350
he's just all about going after it and 
getting it.

176
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Um,
when you talk about going after it and 

177
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,740
get it,
getting it though,

178
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,490
there's,
there's a certain douchey genus that 

179
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,270
just sort of like comes off when you 
talk about like,

180
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,500
you know,
uh,

181
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,430
anything that pumps up your masculinity,
you know,

182
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,360
anything that like makes you more a 
vibrant as a man.

183
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,910
It's like border line,
really Douchey,

184
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:42,240
you know,
and one of the things that was in my 

185
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
message board picked up was it said in 
the,

186
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:47,881
uh,
this new supplement t plus at 

187
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:50,620
testosterone,
but it says something about it 

188
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:50,620
increasing your swagger.

189
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,760
I saw it,
first of all,

190
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:56,310
I it and I went,
no.

191
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,630
I was just like,
no,

192
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,960
please.
They didn't really write swagger,

193
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,690
but it was just for a lot of young 
dudes.

194
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,790
That's a cool thing to say.
Like,

195
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,270
yeah,
you know,

196
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:08,250
it's just my fucking swagger.
Everything.

197
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,330
I mean,
are you being honest?

198
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,820
What is swagger?
Isn't that important?

199
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,690
It's important to have like a sense of 
invigoration.

200
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,130
It just such a Douchey word 
unfortunately is it's not bad to have a 

201
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,280
swagger.
It's definitely bad to use the word.

202
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,700
Yeah.
If it's a like a genuine name,

203
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,310
that should not be said.
Do you know what I mean?

204
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,410
What is that?
When you feel great when your.

205
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,710
When your life is fucking rolling 
around,

206
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:40,010
perfect sound,
the perfect frequency and you have that 

207
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,341
feeling like you just walk up like is 
that that it's not swagger.

208
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:43,800
Okay.

209
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,730
Let's.
It is kind of a swagger but swaggers too

210
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,790
gross or word,
so we have to have another word for it.

211
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,420
What is that feeling?
That feeling like when you're at your 

212
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,420
past like,
wow,

213
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,321
I'm about as happy as I think I've ever 
been a being in the zone,

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,930
but what is that harm?
Whatever.

215
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Whatever it is.
You can't call it swagger now and the 

216
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,190
audit it so thank you.
Rogan board know that the people that 

217
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,330
makes axe body spray probably have a 
good answer with that question.

218
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,080
I don't think they would even be 
perplexed the other.

219
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:21,081
The other thing that the rather rugged 
boy put out was the t plus supplement 

220
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:25,431
has an ad where it's a dude super power 
lifter guy.

221
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:28,230
He's like one of the world champion 
power lifter guy.

222
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:33,231
He was a huge,
enormous guy and I'm the end of the ad 

223
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,240
was him at a bar with two different 
girls and they're like,

224
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,270
this guy look at,
he's stretching,

225
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,020
kissing,
kissing.

226
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,020
No,
he did not go back and look at this 

227
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,440
video.
Every time we an arm,

228
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,240
he's stretching.
What is this thing?

229
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,860
You guys don't understand what you're 
talking about?

230
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,350
He's about to lift $8,000.
Fucking million pounds.

231
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,320
Some guys enormous.
But the commercial is,

232
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:58,920
uh,
you know,

233
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,590
I mean,
the dude's legit power lifter.

234
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,400
The idea is that supplement to increase 
your body's production of testosterone,

235
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:10,401
but at the end of it,
it was a little hotties at a bar and it 

236
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:14,761
was like no grinding cocaine for brain 
powder on it.

237
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,230
That's an enormous person.
That swag.

238
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,610
Do you think he's got swag?
What'd you just say?

239
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,300
Would you not even tell you?
That's why we just say swag?

240
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,320
No,
I'd run from that date.

241
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,370
Honestly.
If I saw that.

242
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,430
Cue The music man.
Usually code named Brogan and go fuck 

243
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,861
yourself Joe Rogan.
We love you.

244
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Powerful dog.
So your back man.

245
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,340
I'm back back.
Back from the precipice.

246
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Back from the precipice,
well none of us are ever like from the 

247
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
precedence,
but I saw a big sign today.

248
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,880
It was something about surviving cancer 
and the lady was a smile and laugh and 

249
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,861
then she was like holding a baby or 
something like that and it says 

250
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:13,861
something about surviving cancer,
and I thought about it.

251
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:16,960
I was like,
we don't really survive shit.

252
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:17,770
Do it.
Nope.

253
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,530
There's no surviving.
Yeah.

254
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Something we do for a little.
We put it off for the amount of time 

255
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:26,800
that you're.
You're sentient.

256
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,000
You extended the amount of time that you
have consciousness.

257
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,940
It's a very funny thing.
It's like our age starts.

258
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:36,941
The moment that matter were composed of 
wakes up to an awareness of itself and 

259
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,240
stops the moment.
It's not aware of itself anymore,

260
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,250
but what we are.
That's not really our age.

261
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:44,660
It's much longer than that and surviving
means you've extended the amount of self

262
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:49,661
awareness by some number of years,
but it doesn't really surviving.

263
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Don't.
This is something I've been entirely on 

264
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:54,830
stage.
The whole surviving cancer thing is a.

265
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,170
it's an annoying term to like now I'm a 
cancer survivor.

266
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,780
That's what I am now.
I don't want to be that.

267
00:12:59,781 --> 00:13:03,710
That's it's so many other things I'd 
like to be represented by then.

268
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,570
Then that,
that's not there.

269
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,610
Anyone out there who's fighting cancer 
right now,

270
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,590
by the way,
keep up the good fight.

271
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:14,591
There's a whole brotherhood that you 
find out there if people and and 

272
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:16,190
sisterhood of people who are dealing 
with this shit and it's beautiful.

273
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,340
So I don't mean to denigrate your 
struggle that you're going through.

274
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,860
It's just,
I wish there was another word for it.

275
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:22,950
And then then,
then,

276
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,410
then survivor such a dire term.
It's such a dire term.

277
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:30,620
It's like you just climbed out of a 
dragon's mouth.

278
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:34,070
There's are smoldering car.
I think

279
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,500
there's a real problem whenever you 
label anything,

280
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
call people,
uh,

281
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,350
you know,
a cancer victim,

282
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:42,300
a cancer survivor,
a cancer,

283
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
a success in the war on cancer,
you know,

284
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,950
whatever,
whenever you,

285
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:48,610
you,
you,

286
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,160
you automatically categorize it,
falls into this sort of package.

287
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,660
They want to classify everything man.
And even not just fucking,

288
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,480
you know,
the,

289
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,450
the,
by the way,

290
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,110
can't find.
I'm a cancer survivor.

291
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:03,580
I had and I don't that.
It's not a term I I care for,

292
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,600
but fine,
but what's weird is when people really 

293
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,380
that's becomes their new identity,
like what they were before,

294
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,381
they didn't die from a disease or a 
thing becomes insignificant to this one 

295
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:19,811
little moment of overcoming something.
And I think that's where it's weird to 

296
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:20,420
me.
It's like,

297
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:21,230
well,
no,

298
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:23,660
you're the sum total of everything 
you've done,

299
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:28,661
not just some inevitable Blewett that 
emerged that you climbed out of or 

300
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,530
temporarily managed to,
uh,

301
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,600
stop.
Why are you wearing a pink ribbon?

302
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:34,350
Then?
How do you know?

303
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,140
How do you know what's tied around my 
cock cock ring?

304
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,130
Who's the first sick fuck that figured 
out a cock ring?

305
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,040
I got to figure out how to get more 
blood in my dick.

306
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,990
Hm?
How do I do this?

307
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,670
Let me just come down.
It might be a good idea.

308
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,671
I've done the finger cock rang though 
when you're like a little too drunk and 

309
00:14:57,671 --> 00:15:00,911
he can't quite get it.
Hard to like squeeze the base of it to 

310
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:00,911
keep us on track.
I didn't know that.

311
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:05,810
How do you know Jesus?
You don't know.

312
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,630
But yeah,
you never know.

313
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,090
So one of my bits,
oh way back in the day and I'm like,

314
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,150
you have to or something like that.
Clamping the base of your cock.

315
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,110
I forget if it was a.
yeah,

316
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:30,970
it was like he was A.
Hugh Hefner had said in this magazine,

317
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
like they were asking him like,
hey you date like these 20 year old 

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,000
girls,
what did they feel?

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,730
How do they feel about dating you?
And he said,

320
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:40,310
well they feel very lucky.
This has always been a dream for them.

321
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,060
And then,
you know,

322
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,160
I had this whole lucky,
lucky living in a dream,

323
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,810
squeezed the base of it.
This guy's got a semi going lucky girl,

324
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,910
sweet quota,
Cock.

325
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Lucky the squeeze,
the base of it to keep it semi going as 

326
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,681
old as time.
So some dude figured out how to deal 

327
00:15:59,681 --> 00:15:59,681
with like a rope

328
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:03,420
girl that hangs out at the comedy store.
And her mom was a famous playboy,

329
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,020
a person that dated Hugh hefner.
And,

330
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,980
and she was saying that one time she had
those balls inside of her,

331
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,870
the banging balls or whatever they're 
calling it.

332
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,270
And then he went down on her and one 
came out and choked him and he,

333
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:18,690
he,
uh,

334
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,370
she had to save his life.

335
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,460
Oh my God.
You fucking freaks.

336
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:28,461
That's the universe trying to kill you.
He fucking balls that shoot chick snatch

337
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,540
giant lead shot.
That's a funny way to dive.

338
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,610
Yeah.
What is that about?

339
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,540
The carry the weights in your pussy.
So it makes you like clamp down and that

340
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,360
that's what keeps your pussy tightens up
the move.

341
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,450
Yeah.
It's like you're constantly tightening 

342
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:46,760
your pussy up to you.
They control these balls that are inside

343
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,170
of you when you walk.
So it's kind of like a,

344
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,580
we fit for your vagina.

345
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,500
That's fucking bananas.
How crazy is that?

346
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,630
Chicks had been lifting weights with 
their pussies.

347
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,490
It works too.
Yeah.

348
00:16:56,491 --> 00:17:00,690
There was a woman in Russia,
I think it was a Russian woman who could

349
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:03,060
stick something in her pussy,
like,

350
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,130
and clamp it down and like pick up 
weight,

351
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,830
like,
like actually like a jaw.

352
00:17:07,831 --> 00:17:12,831
It would clamp down on this shoot,
stick like a ball on a rope and they're 

353
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,940
posting and then clamp down and lift 
weights.

354
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,510
That's crazy.
Have you seen these anal trainer tales?

355
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,530
They're like,
what?

356
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:24,531
Girls who'd like anal?
They keep them inside of them and they 

357
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:24,531
have like a tail,
like a hair tail

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and chick who can lift weights with 
their pussies has got a be just an 

359
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,540
unstoppable freak.
Like there's no way you're going to 

360
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,540
satisfy her.
She's lifting weights with her pussy.

361
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,860
She is like all.
She's all about milking cock.

362
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,220
That's all she is all about.
That's her number one thing online that 

363
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,670
says she's so good at it.
She can't wait to get a cock in there to

364
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:46,550
shock the guy.
It's probably,

365
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,790
and it probably mostly new Cox.
You know these guys like.

366
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,550
And then what's the big.
Oh Shit.

367
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,290
It's like a fucking grabbing a hold of 
her.

368
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,980
I mean she could pick up weights with 
her pussy.

369
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,270
It's probably way stronger than her hand
because she's developed it and like some

370
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:05,940
crazy way.
It's hilarious the way people spend time

371
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:10,941
on this planet.
It's amazing that some people are just 

372
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:10,941
like,
I'm gonna.

373
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,700
Make my pussy strong in this 
incarnation.

374
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,890
Well,
but doing it with.

375
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:15,840
What is it?
What if it was amazing though?

376
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,640
What if it made a huge difference?
Oh,

377
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,320
I don't think there's like,
you know,

378
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,110
like grossly key.
I'm not saying there's better worse.

379
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:27,111
I'm just saying it's a funny thing like 
if you came out of a spaceship on some 

380
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:28,380
alien planet and you're like,
all right,

381
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:33,381
while I'm on this planet,
I'm going to make it so my badge final 

382
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:34,920
muscles are fucking strong.
Well,

383
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,740
if you enjoy sex though,
you enjoy pleasure.

384
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,780
Can we tell them it is possible that you
can make the,

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
the vaginal muscles strong?
You can then.

386
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,350
But why wouldn't you do that?
I would do that if I was a chick.

387
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,980
Why wouldn't you want to a Super Pussy 
Dick Pills?

388
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,440
You do those,
you know,

389
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,450
we all deal with it.
I am not leveling judgment on these 

390
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,620
wonderful women who are making their 
vaginas strong and I encourage it.

391
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,320
I think you should do it if you're drawn
towards that.

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,550
I just think it's a curious thing.
The way people spend their time.

393
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:08,010
That's certainly of the ways people 
spend their time.

394
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,730
That is a fascinating way.
It's also fascinating the idea of like,

395
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:16,731
um,
like a Viagra or something along those 

396
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:17,520
lines,
like a pill that makes your dick hard.

397
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,580
And what if,
what if there was a wooded flood was 

398
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,500
like exercise you could do that could 
make your dick bigger and harder.

399
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,640
You like you could grow your dick the 
way a dude grows his chest muscles.

400
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,880
You know,
just steady workout gyms would be 

401
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:37,880
disgusting.
Did you see the video I posted about the

402
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,790
Indian guy that wraps his cock up in a 
stick and stretches it out?

403
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,200
Oh,
it's on my twitter.

404
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Find that on my twitter and pull it up.
I think we can even show it on new 

405
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,860
stream because you don't really see it 
sort of.

406
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:52,800
He's sort of tucked away.
It's a very strange.

407
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,350
Please use stream.
Don't take us down please.

408
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:56,490
Youtube.
Don't take us down.

409
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,030
Oh yeah.
Ustream won't let you show this.

410
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,500
This,
this,

411
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,320
this.
This is amazing what we got.

412
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,400
Yeah.
If there's nudity in it,

413
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,500
we can't show it.
Show it.

414
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,380
Show it.
It's,

415
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,410
it's like tribal nudity.
Sunday Bible nudity.

416
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,710
That's like National Geographic News.
We can do it in.

417
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:15,930
What will happen?
I don't even want to say what he was 

418
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,250
doing when I was in jail.
Let me turn off my twice.

419
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,740
Okay.
Hold on.

420
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,850
It happened to me already a few times.
Why don't you just describe it in a very

421
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:29,910
picture,
esquire.

422
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,690
Hmm.
I just had it happened.

423
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:37,170
Damn.
Is there a way you can stick a little 

424
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,511
bouncing ball over his cock and balls?
Maybe take a look at this page.

425
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,260
Take a look.
Yeah.

426
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:43,520
Okay.
Just go to my twitter page,

427
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:45,350
but if I tweet it,
I'm a chatty bitch.

428
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,160
I tweeted it up.
You're going to lose a lot.

429
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,030
I mean if you do like the Dick Pills and
use the Zma like I've been doing,

430
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:53,500
I do not do those.
Create.

431
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,140
If I was going to do a pill,
I would get the real chemical.

432
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:56,900
I think you're,
you're,

433
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,160
you're taking a crazy gamble.
What these fucking 7:11

434
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,450
store.
I know.

435
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,270
I'm revealing.
Um,

436
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,200
I've gotten to the point where like I 
realized 7:11

437
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,440
takes the safe route.
Like their products are little bit 

438
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,350
weaker and not say,
but you go to some of these like 

439
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,350
miscellaneous gas stations that they 
don't give a shit.

440
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,720
There's these things called like ml two,
like good for two weeks and you're like,

441
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,670
how is that even possible?
And then take it and like,

442
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,300
I'm like,
I'm cover.

443
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,840
It's just like a skull in a boob or 
something.

444
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:28,030
The way they're getting away with it,
as Aubrey told us was that they're 

445
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,180
taking,
they're taking,

446
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,500
they're taking giant amounts of generic 
cialis and generic Viagra and those 

447
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:40,261
chemicals are not that expensive and you
can get those chemicals and if you sell 

448
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:43,450
it in like little single serving forms 
at a gas station,

449
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,540
it's actually profitable.
So these crazy flux,

450
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,580
they're just selling Viagara.
It's,

451
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,650
I mean it's Cialis,
Viagra.

452
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,710
I should go grab the one that's in my 
car and just show you how ridiculous is 

453
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,130
that?
You also should really listen to what 

454
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,130
Tim Ferriss said.
Oh,

455
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,790
I know Tim Ferriss,
who's a brilliant guy,

456
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,110
has a great quote.

457
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,070
And the quote is he doesn't believe that
there is a biological free lunch.

458
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,490
He's like,
anything that's doing hasn't has that 

459
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,431
positive and impact in one direction 
will have most likely and equal equally 

460
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:21,241
positive reaction in another direction.
It's very possible that it could cause 

461
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:25,501
real issues.
You're talking about something super 

462
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:25,501
potent.
Yeah.

463
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:25,501
Isn't that weird?
Why is that?

464
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,430
That's a fascinating thing.
That one thing.

465
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,640
There's always a weird trade off,
but I mean,

466
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:34,000
what could it be that your Dick doesn't 
work without that stuff?

467
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,920
Is that possible?
I think with Dick Pills,

468
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,420
it's better to burn out than to fade 
away.

469
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,620
Did you just went deaf?
Leopard Leppard us.

470
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,030
That's right.
That's hilarious.

471
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,710
Yeah.
Well you might have a good point.

472
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,630
It depends on,
you know,

473
00:22:55,631 --> 00:23:00,631
would you rather have.
I don't do it every 10 years of life 

474
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:03,661
left with boners or 30 years of life 
with basically start you start off with 

475
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:10,840
three quarter Chubby this year.
I only do it half a Chubby next year,

476
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,700
but you'll know it shuts off and within 
five or six years and then basically the

477
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,250
rest of your life you just,
you know,

478
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,310
walk around.
I only do it when I go to strip clubs 

479
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,710
for the most part,
unless I know that there's a guaranteed 

480
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,110
good lineup of sex that night.
Oh yeah.

481
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,970
Well,
as long as you're not abusing it,

482
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:28,650
Brian.
Yeah.

483
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,600
I just don't know if that stuff's safe.
I mean,

484
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,160
what is a.
I don't know.

485
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,240
What's the studies on,
on taking that,

486
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
Brian,
those boner pills,

487
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,490
those things are magic.

488
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,670
Not supposed to post to

489
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,940
take with her on nitrates.
Is that correct?

490
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,250
Like men who have real serious heart 
issues,

491
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:49,730
I believe.

492
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,460
Yeah.
Now you have a very serious heart issue.

493
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:55,490
You also shouldn't be fucking like a 12 
year old and these things.

494
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,530
Make sure you should.
Well,

495
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:58,660
it depends on what,
what,

496
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,530
what would it go?
That's the way to go.

497
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:02,120
It's a great,
great way to go.

498
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,100
But those pills you gave me.
Hot Rods,

499
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,820
$50,000.
Those fucking things.

500
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,780
Those give you like,
like first time you see porn when you're

501
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:18,170
a terminal boaters criminal like insane.
Hiroshima,

502
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:19,040
boner.
You know why?

503
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,800
Also why it's sold,
where it's sold,

504
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,710
because it's soda for gay people to go 
clubbing.

505
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh Geez.
I mean a straight guys going take 

506
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,891
advantage of that.
All that Boehner in the and the and the 

507
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:33,470
fucking thing.
Man.

508
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,660
It says on it.
I researched this stuff,

509
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,530
it says,
and this made me think that our breeze,

510
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,750
cialis theory was totally dead on 
because on the website it says that the 

511
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,840
ingredient is crushed up and I know amp 
owners,

512
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,870
but that's something someone lying says.
She's like saying anything.

513
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:55,130
Nobody fucking cares.
They have great boners.

514
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,940
Don't care when you could say

515
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,880
that's hilarious.
That's exactly what it saved.

516
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,420
They're totally bullshitting.
You know,

517
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,700
what is it?
Odds bugs crushed up and give a fuck 

518
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,331
what it is to make sure the questions 
I'm trying to sell some illegal shit.

519
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Yeah,
I mean there's the food and drug 

520
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,320
administration ever shake loose a tablet
and there's on an ad in this bucket,

521
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,220
do they shake loose tablets

522
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,860
and then by the way,
it might be possible that there's a 

523
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,981
toxin in certain answers that could give
you a hard on because they know that 

524
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:34,400
spider has it.
Sure does.

525
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:37,840
That that spider in Brazil,
the walking spider,

526
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,340
it apparently it just wanders around the
ground and if it stings you,

527
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,520
it gives you the most in possibly 
painful Boehner where you dick splits 

528
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:49,380
open like a ballpark frank.

529
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,160
Yeah,
you're done.

530
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,040
It's super good.

531
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,170
Do Bird toxic.
Okay.

532
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,470
It doesn't just give you this ridiculous
boner it most.

533
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,110
Most of the time it kills people,
but if it doesn't kill you,

534
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,810
your Dick is done.
Your Dick's broken forever.

535
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,030
Why do we allow that to exist?
That spider,

536
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:10,630
it's a red lining.
Dick bug it just red lines or dick.

537
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,120
It's like taking it

538
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,360
like engine deep into the fucking piston
starts smoking ganja.

539
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,700
I don't know why we allow that,
but Jesus Christ,

540
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:24,420
that's a scary fucking animal insect.
Rather you dilute it down enough.

541
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,490
You know,
you mix it with enough stuff.

542
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:27,450
It's perfect.
Yeah.

543
00:26:27,451 --> 00:26:28,140
That's wonderful.
Well,

544
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,880
that's what they're thinking now.
Spider.

545
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,120
But they're trying to.
They're trying to figure out a way to do

546
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:38,121
it and apparently that's connected to 
nitric oxide and nitric oxide.

547
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I believe I'm saying it right is what is
in a lot those like not to explode,

548
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:48,360
like all these different sort of 
supplements.

549
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,630
He's like workout supplements and get 
people pumped up because apparently 

550
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,690
Viagra,
cialis,

551
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,770
all those things,
their,

552
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,260
their performance enhancing its far as 
like your,

553
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:04,290
your body's ability to pump blood like 
through itself and makes you more 

554
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,930
efficient and it gives you an endurance 
benefit.

555
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,400
So I do.
Yeah.

556
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,340
So they're,
they're making it.

557
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,870
I believe it's illegal in the Olympics.
I think he can't be on.

558
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,930
I know you can't be on that pro provigil
that provigil is illegal in the 

559
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,821
Olympics.
They test for that shit now and I 

560
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:22,821
believe they test for this as well.

561
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,300
Yeah man,
that provigils pretty awesome too.

562
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,720
I,
you know,

563
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:30,721
I just found this,
I started looking up like my favorite 

564
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,500
authors to see if they were on speed 
because I read and like the majority of 

565
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:38,600
my favorite authors are on speed and,
and that.

566
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,450
And that really got me thinking,
man,

567
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:43,450
that really got me thinking.
It's like [inaudible] pro vigil,

568
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,430
adderall.
These are modern speed.

569
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,440
It's speed.
And forgive me for saying this man,

570
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:55,120
but my experience with speed and Alpha 
brain outbrain is speed.

571
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,450
Like you can call it an.
I'm sure it has like thought enhancing 

572
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,530
things,
but it's speed.

573
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,550
When you take that drug,
you feel that

574
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,580
he feels like Alpha remix.
You feel speed.

575
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
Low level adderall.
Wow.

576
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:13,430
I've never done adderall,
but what Alpha brain does for me,

577
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:17,380
it never makes me feel it's accelerated.
We feel like smoother.

578
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,170
I.
Yeah.

579
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:21,820
It gives me a,
it gives me a mild speed

580
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,750
bump.
Wow.

581
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,160
That's interesting.
When did you,

582
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:27,530
what do you do are you're doing the old 
formula or the newer forming?

583
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:32,570
The new formula is more conservative 
because some people were having 

584
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:32,570
headaches.

585
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,260
It was the old formula.
And what made me feel weird and it did 

586
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,260
give me weird dreams.

587
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,700
Oh yeah.
The dreams if you take them like right 

588
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:39,700
before bed.
I mean it's.

589
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,660
Dreams are weird.
It's like I don't know how to guarantee 

590
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:43,660
a dream.
You know,

591
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,590
people go to carroll for and fucking no 
dreams.

592
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,490
You might have.
You just don't remember him.

593
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,550
Okay.
And I don't know why you remember some 

594
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:51,550
of them.
Why you don't,

595
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,580
I'll go like days and not remember a 
fucking dream and then I'll do some 

596
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,980
Alpha brand or something and somehow or 
another I'll catch a dream.

597
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,080
I'll catch a good one that I remember 
and I'm like,

598
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,580
well then I'll start remembering a bunch
of them.

599
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,680
Dude.
I mean you dream every night.

600
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,120
A fucking Alpha brain dream where I was 
in a garden.

601
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,540
I was standing in this primordial garden
and there was like fucking all these 

602
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:18,451
weird like silvery golden apples 
floating up in the trees.

603
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,170
And I held this like weird silver mirror
underneath it and it.

604
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,800
And it made the,
what the fuck are the front?

605
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,640
What are you giving me this for?
Why are you going to need.

606
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,470
That's my,
that's my emergency pack.

607
00:29:29,471 --> 00:29:34,471
That's actually what they sell.
Now they sold like a condom with a guy 

608
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:37,801
pill and a girl pill together.
So you give the girl the pill and then 

609
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:38,530
you take your pill.
You wait like an hour.

610
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,080
And it's like raging boners and 
vibrating vaginas.

611
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,150
Yeah.

612
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:47,390
And there's the girl pilled do it.
Just like the girl I was with said that 

613
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,300
just made her vagina feels like really 
tingly.

614
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,530
Huh.
And uh,

615
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,690
the other day I didn't even know there 
was a girl pill.

616
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,540
Well that's a fee.
That's my emergency packs that I keep in

617
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,810
my car.
But uh,

618
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,370
the other one,
the other one's for five days.

619
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,510
This was the one that is,
uh,

620
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,050
achieved a cheap one.

621
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,580
Dick's going to blow up.
It's made entirely of wandering spiders 

622
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:14,200
going to explode.
Yeah.

623
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,770
Mega night.
And some magnum condom,

624
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:18,970
of course.
Yeah,

625
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:20,410
of course.
Because you got a big giant dip,

626
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:20,620
right?

627
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,740
No,
it's because this pill makes you have a 

628
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:25,740
big giant it,
but you have a big giant Dick Anyway.

629
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,060
No I don't.
It's pretty decent.

630
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,120
It's a little bit of average.
The girth is what's really good about 

631
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,120
it.

632
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,710
The chick say that's very important.
You have like a shorter dick,

633
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,760
but it was just stretch out a little bit
more.

634
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,180
What's the hook also like?
I've always put my boner like underneath

635
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:42,710
my belt,
like my whole life.

636
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,020
Like,
so it's like facing my head,

637
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,160
like straight up you smash it.
Been smashing it and like bending it 

638
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,540
towards my face.
The whole child.

639
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,450
I'll never have a boner.
I just put them behind my belt and then 

640
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:56,660
sometimes I forget about it too long and
it hurts.

641
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,690
So you like stretching your dick out the
way those African ladies do with their 

642
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,810
neck and the rings pointed towards your 
own face.

643
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:05,620
It makes it ben and grow towards your 
own face thing.

644
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,680
So that's what urban myths on.
That's just the shape shape at Dick's 

645
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,570
board with some people are born with 
Kirby as Dick's.

646
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,030
The only thing that would really do it 
was trauma.

647
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,950
You can get a broken dick.
There's a dude named Ray lb who uh,

648
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,980
is an MMA fighter who posted a picture 
of like a bunch of bloods shit and told 

649
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:29,201
his story on the underground girl got on
top and she planned and less dick had 

650
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,790
broke his deck and it started bleeding.
It can happen apparently,

651
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,730
but in that can,
that can give your Dick Funky,

652
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,690
funky,
right?

653
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,290
Right Hook.

654
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,400
Have you sprained your Dick from having 
like I sprayed my dick recently where it

655
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,440
hurt for like three days a week.
Don't let crazy bitches get on top.

656
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,960
You've got to control the situation,
son.

657
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Anybody breaking your Dick because were 
on ecstasy and they fucking think this 

658
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:49,520
is an awesome song.

659
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,690
Yeah,
a girl can do it.

660
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:59,680
A lot of damage.
If she slips on it wrong,

661
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,640
she taints you.
She takes you right on the crowd.

662
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:05,280
It was bumped Boeing,
right?

663
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:06,870
The bone.
Your Dick especially,

664
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:11,871
she's got some good fucking thigh 
muscles and maybe she plays volleyball 

665
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:12,960
or something.
Did it good at jumping

666
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:18,940
a duncan?
I was listening to your podcast the 

667
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,380
other day and you see that you've only 
had sex on the road once,

668
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,960
like you don't take advantage of the,
the,

669
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:22,770
like I've seen it

670
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,910
club,
I've seen it.

671
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:26,040
I saw a beautiful,
crazy girl trying to get,

672
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:26,850
talking to sleep with her.

673
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,780
Do you,
do you not?

674
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,320
Are you not a horny sex maniac or no?
No,

675
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:31,840
no man,
I,

676
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,670
you know,
I'm really,

677
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:34,870
I get really fucking horny.
But um,

678
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,600
like I,
I,

679
00:32:36,601 --> 00:32:38,340
um,
well there's two,

680
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,440
two things.
One,

681
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:40,190
I tend to

682
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,190
have a girlfriend and I don't.
I'm monogamous,

683
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,060
so I,
I,

684
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,190
that's one thing.
But when that's not happening,

685
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,670
then generally there's this,
it's like I get,

686
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,300
I really get up in my head about it and 
so I think about,

687
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,720
I overthink it like I'm way in my head 
about everything.

688
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:59,090
Like I'm,
I live in my head most of the time and,

689
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,550
and when you live in,
there's good things about living in your

690
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:05,510
head and what,
but when it comes to fucking and jumping

691
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:10,511
into this primal,
animalistic state that creates the best 

692
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,070
sexual experience where you just let go 
and,

693
00:33:12,071 --> 00:33:13,310
and,
and it's,

694
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,360
it's more difficult to meet,
especially out on the fucking road 

695
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,620
because,
uh,

696
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,800
I consider the lead up to it and I 
consider the follow follow like after 

697
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:26,600
you fuck,
you know what I mean?

698
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,340
And it's like because porn is the 
ultimate,

699
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
because with porn you jerk off to porn 
and that's it.

700
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,890
You don't have to like walk porn to the 
door.

701
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:37,040
You don't have to like have a like porn.
It's done.

702
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,080
It's not going to call you up like porn 
that you've looked at is not going to 

703
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,070
call you up and be like,
I'm fucking pregnant.

704
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:48,850
You know what I mean?
It's just done and so you just get this 

705
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:49,040
middle thing when you watch porn,
you don't see the beginning,

706
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,100
you don't see what happens right before 
the porn shoot or God forbid,

707
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:53,020
10 years,
the,

708
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:53,990
the,
you know,

709
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:58,991
the girl like walking in on her dad 
fucking a dog or something or getting 

710
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:02,660
fingered by her uncle.
You just see this incredible,

711
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:06,350
beautiful primal moment of fucking and 
you don't see afterwards,

712
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,660
after the porn shoot.
You know what I mean?

713
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:12,590
That weird moment in the car,
driving back from a porn shoot,

714
00:34:12,591 --> 00:34:14,690
you know,
you wipe a little jazz out of your hair,

715
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,820
you know,
you don't use that whole thing.

716
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,500
You just get that one burst.
Right.

717
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:20,840
So on the road it's like fucking on the 
road.

718
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:25,430
It seems like there's a lot of pitfalls 
there and a lot of weird dangers.

719
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,680
It's a lot more than just like,
you know,

720
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:30,110
what a seven,
what would be in his seventies movie,

721
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,670
but like I said,
I think too much.

722
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,190
You know what I mean?
I think clearly overthinking it.

723
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,900
Satanists are all about doing that 
stuff.

724
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:40,970
You know,
I had a friend who was a satanist and he

725
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:42,900
said that,
uh,

726
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,280
in life,
and I remember it was really,

727
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:50,420
it's really rough when it Satan says 
something that seems like absolutely 

728
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,560
true,
but he's like,

729
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:56,660
because you know,
this is coming from a guy with lucifer 

730
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:56,660
tattooed on his chest,
but he said,

731
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,210
you know,
in life he said,

732
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:04,211
hell,
hell is not someplace where you burn 

733
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,860
forever.
Hell is that moment that you're dying.

734
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,950
That moment when you're at your death 
bed or you're in the car,

735
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:11,930
you're sitting at the car,
wherever the fuck you are,

736
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:17,830
you're dying and your mind goes back and
thinks about all those opportunities you

737
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:22,961
had to experience life to the fullest.
All those chances you had to dive into 

738
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:26,510
life and suck the marrow out of life.
And you did not have fear.

739
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,080
That's hell now.
That was coming from no hills way worse 

740
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,740
than that,
that you can just jerk off and ticketing

741
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:37,980
them if that's what your life is.
That's not that bad.

742
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,430
What do you mean pink?
Disappointed in life is not as bad as 

743
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,430
being tortured by Mongols.

744
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Well,
I mean he was saying how he doesn't 

745
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,020
exist,
you know,

746
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,020
the whole Christian idea now is 
nonsense.

747
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,620
That the only real house since there is 
no how.

748
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,650
Absolutely.
If there was obviously if there was a 

749
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,961
real Christian,
how are demons fly down and put their 

750
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:57,961
balls in your mouth and like slice you 
into bits every five years.

751
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,580
Wouldn't you be surprised if there 
actually was a.

752
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:04,880
How fucked up would that be?
If there was a hell of hell was real.

753
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:09,600
I mean think about how fucking stupid 
you would feel if you were actually like

754
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,310
being confronted by demons.
They were flipping your eternal soul.

755
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,990
They'd be like,
motherfucker,

756
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,280
I can't believe it.

757
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,890
They warned me.
Yeah,

758
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,380
yeah.

759
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,550
If you imagine,
how crazy would it be if you got down 

760
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:23,550
there and there was a devil,
some dude.

761
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,780
He's got goat horns.
Like,

762
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:25,960
yeah,

763
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,550
they just start ripping you apart piece 
by piece over and over again,

764
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:35,680
and they put you back together again for
eternity.

765
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,220
Well,
see,

766
00:36:36,221 --> 00:36:37,990
this is the funny thing about hell,
man,

767
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:40,900
when you want to really get into the 
hell talk or the hell trip.

768
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:42,990
I know people who've had held trips 
you've ever,

769
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,530
you've probably never had the hell 
trick,

770
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,750
the bad trips and felt like they were in
hell.

771
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,690
Where are you start thinking like,
oh,

772
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,400
I mean,
because look,

773
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,420
when you were talking about how we're 
talking about a torture chamber created 

774
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,620
by the general,
obviously I did not believe this,

775
00:36:56,621 --> 00:37:01,621
but if we're talking about how it's a 
torture chamber created by the creator 

776
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:05,761
of the known universe,
so it is the most advanced torture 

777
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:08,461
chamber that could possibly exist.
It's created by the most advanced being 

778
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:12,690
psychotic in this case,
but the most advanced being so when our 

779
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,070
real torture chamber the year means of 
torture,

780
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:19,090
not going to be so obvious is like 
burning fire and it burns your skin.

781
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:24,390
The first thing you'd want people to 
think is that they're not in a torture 

782
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,661
chamber.
You'd want them to think that there's 

783
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:28,960
some hope,
some hope for peace as long as they were

784
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:33,961
hoping for peace and thinking that there
was going to be some moment of 

785
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:37,321
tranquility.
It would like increase their levels of 

786
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:37,630
disappointment to the maximum.
So that's the health trip.

787
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,250
The trip is where you start thinking 
like,

788
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,720
oh shit,
this is it.

789
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,360
This is how we've been.
This is,

790
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:48,361
this is the ultimate torture device 
device by some maniacal insane God that 

791
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:53,710
everyone's popped into and instead of 
like remembering where they're at,

792
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:54,820
they're just like,
oh no,

793
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:59,821
this is totally normal.
And gotta go through traffic in the 

794
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,210
morning,
got to go through three hour commute.

795
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,520
You know what I mean?
That's how you don't even know you're 

796
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:06,520
there.
You don't even know you're there.

797
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,230
Maybe slowly you start with,
I don't think that by the way,

798
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,300
the opposite works too.
You know,

799
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:13,180
you can also think that this is heaven 
and you're just too dumb to see it.

800
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,500
You get to this,
you know,

801
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:18,490
you can pick where those two a different
mythological constructs

802
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,100
just abandoned those ideas and just deal
with the present because it's the only 

803
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,110
thing you really know and we do know 
that when you live in hell,

804
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,450
when we use that,
all that guy lives in hell.

805
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,310
It's a series of shitty choices,
a bad circumstance,

806
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,010
bad luck,
combination

807
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,960
of all of the above.
And,

808
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:38,560
uh,
most,

809
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:43,060
most of the time when you use that term,
Guy Lives in hell,

810
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,280
you're talking about guys under 
someone's thumb,

811
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,030
whether it's a,
whether it works for some crazy company,

812
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,360
you know,
that,

813
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:57,361
you know,
demands him working 16 hours a day and 

814
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:57,361
his weekends.
And you know,

815
00:38:57,361 --> 00:39:01,441
there's a lot of guys that live in how 
they're like executives of studios and 

816
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:02,740
stuff like that.
Like those are crazy ass jobs.

817
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,900
You know,
what we're working in,

818
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:09,901
you know what I mean?
I'm sure like stock market along those 

819
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:10,090
lines,
like anything financial,

820
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:15,091
there's probably a lot of people that 
are forced to wear a crazy fucking 

821
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:15,091
hours.
Right?

822
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:18,330
That's right.
And if you have like real restrictive 

823
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:18,640
work conditions,
you have to wear a suit and tie.

824
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:21,820
You have to fucking be very formal 
around the office.

825
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:24,310
Nobody can fuck around,
nobody can relax all day.

826
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,700
Most of your day is just buttoned up in,
locked down.

827
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,850
Yeah.
Yeah,

828
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:33,851
man,
that's definitely one version of when 

829
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:33,851
you hear people say that they're in,
how it's uh,

830
00:39:33,851 --> 00:39:34,490
um,
but still,

831
00:39:34,491 --> 00:39:36,290
you know,
there's this idea,

832
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:41,330
you know,
Krishna Murti ever heard of Krishna 

833
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:41,330
Murti?
No,

834
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:41,500
Jay Krishna Murti,
he's this philosopher,

835
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,510
the Indian philosopher who is like this 
kid who was discovered by the 

836
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,000
theosophists and theosophy were this 
strange spiritual group and I don't know

837
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:55,001
a lot about them,
but they have madam blood tasky and was 

838
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,570
the woman's name,
but they spotted this Indian kid,

839
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,490
uh,
at the beach and one of them was like,

840
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,500
his aura is amazing or something,
and they sort of took this kid in and 

841
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,401
groom this child.
Any eventually became this brilliant 

842
00:40:09,401 --> 00:40:10,130
philosopher and a,
as part of his,

843
00:40:10,131 --> 00:40:12,680
like evolution turned his back on 
theosophy and said,

844
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:14,260
it's not that,
you know,

845
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,270
it's more.
He got really into the idea of being in 

846
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,270
the moment.

847
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,270
And I actually,
I wanted my podcast.

848
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,951
I put a awesome sound clip of him 
talking about how the past you carry the

849
00:40:24,771 --> 00:40:27,320
past with you.
The past is in you right now.

850
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,210
It doesn't exist.
There is no past.

851
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,720
There's just your encoded memories of 
things that have happened.

852
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,680
And the future is something you create 
through everything that you do.

853
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,760
But there's no future either in.
It's like you're this packet,

854
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,800
like a d,
like the DNA packet,

855
00:40:42,801 --> 00:40:47,420
the way their DNA for sort of spawns a 
specific type of cell.

856
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,750
What you do with what you carry around 
with you in every single moment spawns 

857
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,570
your reality around you,
which is why people who you know,

858
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,770
you always will run into.
People are like,

859
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,540
I don't know why this always happens to 
me.

860
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,910
I always get dumped.
I just don't understand it.

861
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:06,320
I always get dumped or I always end up 
in this predicament or that predicament,

862
00:41:06,321 --> 00:41:11,321
or the reason is you're like a 
caterpillar or a silkworm and you're 

863
00:41:11,321 --> 00:41:14,430
spinning your reality with every action 
that you do because that's all there is.

864
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,860
It's just this,
you know this moment.

865
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,440
So you end up with a shit boss,
you know,

866
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,290
and you've ended up there just because 
you've been diluted by that,

867
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:27,790
by your perception of time,
you know that's the fucking trick 

868
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,480
because people listening to this habit 
shitbox shit,

869
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,480
white shit,
girlfriend,

870
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,410
shit,
husband,

871
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:31,220
shit,
whatever.

872
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,270
You know what I mean?
And,

873
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,610
and,
and this sound clip J.

874
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,610
Krishna Murti says,
the only thing that you can do is right 

875
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,671
now at this moment,
make a radical psychological change in 

876
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:45,920
your apprehension of the universe at 
this moment,

877
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:51,340
at this moment where the ship boss with 
whatever it takes this radical like you 

878
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,321
have to break free of everything you've 
been taught because we've all been 

879
00:41:56,321 --> 00:42:00,071
taught to think that there's a future 
and we've all been taught to think 

880
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:00,071
there's a past.

881
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:04,300
There's also an issue that people have.
This narrative has been sort of spelled 

882
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,980
out for us by our parents and then as we
get old enough,

883
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,010
when we get into our twenties or 
thirties,

884
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:11,840
we really understand it.
We were like,

885
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,460
oh my God.
They were just clueless.

886
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:18,461
Folks just like we are like the idea 
that anybody had a handle on how to do 

887
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:19,820
this.
Right,

888
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,060
and then you just look at the fact that 
these people,

889
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:28,090
I mean your parents and my parents are 
from a generation where they got into 

890
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,960
our age before there was an internet.
I mean they're,

891
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,840
they're literally,
they're different human beings.

892
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:40,900
It's a completely different style of 
human being to human being one where 

893
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:45,890
human being to human being three that 
are being born right now,

894
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,180
you know that will only know insane 
levels of technological proficiency from

895
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:56,300
the time that they're aware when they're
three or four till till they're dead,

896
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:57,110
when it's insane.

897
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,120
That's right.
These are.

898
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:04,121
This is the strangest times of all and 
no one knows how to run it now.

899
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,580
No one knows how to figure this out.
No one knows.

900
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,060
The more information keeps coming in,
the weirder things start getting the 

901
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,740
fucking meteors landing in Russia.
The fact that no one even saw those 

902
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,461
coming and that there was a giant 
asteroid that whipped overhead within a 

903
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,390
day of that he asked and it was inside 
the outer band of satellites.

904
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:30,260
Like there's.
There's a whole lot of weirdness to this

905
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:33,400
world that we live in that we're just 
not taking into consideration

906
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,220
at.
All.

907
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,770
Right.
Well fuck yeah man.

908
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,410
And it all started me and generally with
people it all like that.

909
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,730
That thing where we like just don't 
think about them as a species.

910
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,210
We are living in the same way a modern 
individual lives as species as a whole 

911
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,460
is living in a state of delusion.
The species as a whole is pretending 

912
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:59,860
that the most important thing is solving
whatever little religious war or a 

913
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:06,370
territory based war or economic problem,
they think that's the most important 

914
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:11,021
thing in the way we're living as a 
species is all based on the notion of 

915
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,700
there being a of the individual instead 
of the totality of the race.

916
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,630
So this,
this way of living is one of denial,

917
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:22,370
so the human race right now exists on a 
planet where we blow each other up every

918
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:24,470
single day,
fight these ridiculous wars,

919
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:29,590
fight against each other,
and completely ignore the fact that we 

920
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,730
are floating in the void and this on the
regs,

921
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,570
on the regs,
get smashed by fucking media whores.

922
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Now,
why the fuck would we not be doing the 

923
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:42,260
obvious thing which would be in this 
situation?

924
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,120
If the first thing you would do is 
figure out,

925
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:50,121
okay,
let's come up with a foolproof way to 

926
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:50,121
control media yours,
then we'll then we'll fight.

927
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:50,121
They don't fight it,

928
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,550
b one,
and not only that,

929
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:54,530
a lot of these asteroids that they're 
picking up,

930
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,590
they're coming in from amateur amateur 
astronomers,

931
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:59,060
like a good percentage of them.

932
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,290
Oh yeah,
I know,

933
00:45:00,291 --> 00:45:02,990
but that's not that many professionals 
watching the sky.

934
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,280
Well,
well this is the whole thing.

935
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:08,270
Or they say like one month know we 
stopped one month of war in Afghanistan.

936
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,910
You know,
you know that that number,

937
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:15,911
right?
If you stop the war for one month in 

938
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:17,771
Afghanistan,
you could pay for everybody in the 

939
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:19,610
United States to go to college for free.
Some kind of crazy number.

940
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:21,350
Now that number,
it might be two months.

941
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,090
So in the same way if you consider that,
you know what I mean?

942
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:29,091
I wasn't saying it as a species are a 
priorities are a little weird and as an 

943
00:45:29,091 --> 00:45:31,790
individual,
you know people in the same way.

944
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:36,791
They spend most of their time ignoring 
the fact that there is a subjective 

945
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:39,320
media or that's going guaranteed going 
to smash into your life at some point,

946
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,370
which is old age disease and death.
There's no way around it,

947
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:46,700
so people spend their time ignoring that
fact as well.

948
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,100
You know,
it's uh,

949
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,840
it makes sense in a way.
I mean,

950
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,420
thinking about it so fucking intense.
It's a lot easier to worry about your 

951
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,380
own personal problems.
The little things,

952
00:45:57,381 --> 00:45:57,740
you know.

953
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,460
Yeah.
I want to,

954
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,590
I want to find this military budget cut 
thing.

955
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,350
If that's true,
done one month of the military budget.

956
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,130
If you cut it out,

957
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,530
it wouldn't surprise me.
Find out what the yearly military budget

958
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:15,700
is and you know,
it's like,

959
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,190
look,
this is this,

960
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,680
this is the fucking thing that Neil 
degrasse tyson posts,

961
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,130
which is like the picture of the media 
or whatever and this is why we need to 

962
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,130
work,
you know,

963
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,620
so I need to work on the space program.

964
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,380
Fuck,
can we.

965
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,140
Do you know what I also think,
I think that schools should be free.

966
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,280
I think we should be paying for,
for whatever it is,

967
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,900
college,
high school,

968
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:36,790
everything.
I think I,

969
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,800
I think school should be free always.
I think it should be free and it should 

970
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,730
be encouraged and we should pay for it 
with,

971
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,110
with our taxes,
you know,

972
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:50,111
I would rather pay for fucking,
like a really high level school that 

973
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,470
kids could go to.
Even if there are poor,

974
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,770
I would way rather pay for that then pay
for more military bullshit.

975
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,760
More drones,
drones above.

976
00:46:58,761 --> 00:47:01,180
I mean,
you could do that,

977
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,700
that,
that,

978
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,240
that could be something that can be 
done.

979
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,060
Sure.
I mean that's the thing,

980
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:10,061
but that it can't be done as long as 
we're confused as a species into 

981
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:10,940
thinking that there are,
um,

982
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:16,430
religions that are more important than 
religions are countries that are more 

983
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,271
important than other countries or people
that are more important than other 

984
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:19,460
people.
As long as we're stuck in that modality,

985
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,640
well then we're never going to fucking 
wake up to the fact that we have to 

986
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:24,640
shift.
You know,

987
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,310
and it's saying the staff,
you know,

988
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:28,490
suddenly sound like you're seeing in 
Goddamn a John Lennon song,

989
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,290
but it's fucking hit them motherfucking 
problem.

990
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,570
I have a John Lennon is,
he was banging Yoko Ono.

991
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:35,550
Jesus,
Dude,

992
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:38,660
you're John Lennon.
I donate,

993
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,740
donate that sweet Asian.
We've shown you the video of John Lennon

994
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,760
with Chuck Berry singing when Yoko Ono 
start screaming and

995
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,340
the microphone like,
Bill Bird does this bid on it.

996
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:53,860
If you haven't heard this,
you have to see it on youtube.

997
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,110
Go find it on Youtube.
Bill Burr,

998
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,230
Chuck Berry,
Yoko Ono.

999
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,270
It's fucking hole.

1000
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,090
But,
but,

1001
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:06,260
but back then wasn't Asians more rare?
Like it was almost like dating,

1002
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,760
you know?
I mean because like all the war and 

1003
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,260
stuff like that weren't easy to find.
She's a dangling.

1004
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,610
I mean when,
when we were in Florida,

1005
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,320
it's not that important that a person's 
race.

1006
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:20,750
It's not that important.
It's like who the fuck are they?

1007
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:21,550
That,
that,

1008
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,080
that,
that checks alone.

1009
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,390
Yep.
That was probably so in back.

1010
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,440
Probably like dating men hate.

1011
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,510
That's what he loved.
I,

1012
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,880
I,
I don't blame them.

1013
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,980
It's the only thing that I disagree with
them on.

1014
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,230
Everything else.
I think he was brilliant.

1015
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:40,350
He's pretty brilliant man.
I don't think anybody ever gets the 

1016
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:40,350
whole package.
Correct?

1017
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:40,460
Well,
no,

1018
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,480
not,
not in one run.

1019
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,950
How do you know if this is zero?
I'm an old soul,

1020
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,930
you know,
everybody always says that,

1021
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,750
you know,
I think I've been around before.

1022
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:55,140
I think I've had many lives.
No one ever goes.

1023
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,580
I think this is,
I just,

1024
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,510
I was a rabbit in the last life and a 
fucking.

1025
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:03,450
This is my first time as a person.
It's nice to be on board.

1026
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,650
Yeah,
no,

1027
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,710
everybody is.
Uh,

1028
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,110
I'm an old soul.

1029
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:07,480
Well,
yeah,

1030
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:12,481
there are a lot of people.
A lot of Cleopatra is out there of 

1031
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:15,300
Cleopatra.
Everybody in their past life was doing 

1032
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,120
something awesome.
Yeah.

1033
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,010
No Shit.
Whenever never finds out

1034
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,190
there were just homeless.
Just losers shitting on themselves,

1035
00:49:22,191 --> 00:49:23,810
sucking dick for homemade wine.

1036
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:27,730
A man that would be so fucking great to 
beg for crumbs,

1037
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,160
be able to like remember all those 
things.

1038
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,010
It'd be so great just to know,
you know,

1039
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:34,000
in the way they can do your DNA tests.
And they're like,

1040
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:34,930
whoa.
You're like,

1041
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:40,210
you know,
partially Scottish and there's some 

1042
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,500
native American in there.
It'd be so cool to like analyze all your

1043
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:43,240
particles and be like,
Oh yes.

1044
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,860
Four percent of you came from the Alpha 
Centauri star cluster and the other two,

1045
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:53,580
you know what I mean?
To be super cool to know like just the 

1046
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,230
various star particulates that are,
that you are comprised of the incredible

1047
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:56,820
or animals like seven years,
seven years

1048
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,860
percent cat.
I heard this and I'm not sure if it's 

1049
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,550
correct.
So there's a disclaimer before,

1050
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:05,770
um,
before I talk about it,

1051
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:09,490
but they were talking about,
oh fuck,

1052
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:13,620
I can't remember this now of trying to.
Uh,

1053
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,370
it's too,
it's too weird.

1054
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:15,850
I,
I'll,

1055
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,380
I'll get back to it,
I'll get back to it.

1056
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,930
It's,
I'm trying to remember how it goes.

1057
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,070
It's,
I don't want to fuck this up.

1058
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,110
I'm going to look it up and make sure 
that I get it right.

1059
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,940
What about that couldn't terantin of 
video,

1060
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,290
but before that,
what were we just talking about?

1061
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,100
Just before that we're

1062
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,160
talking about tracing your weird DNA 
back and I don't know,

1063
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,070
I can't remember how he got there,
what it was.

1064
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:35,480
Okay.
So this is the,

1065
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,300
this is the,
I don't know if this is true,

1066
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,600
but they believe that within the next 
100 years they will have a computer that

1067
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:49,811
is powerful enough.
You ready for this to take into account 

1068
00:50:49,811 --> 00:50:54,130
everything that exists today and use it 
in a numerical equation that will show 

1069
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,440
everything that ever existed in every 
action and interaction that ever took 

1070
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,590
place in the past in order to get to 
that position.

1071
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,840
So they'll basically look at all the 
buildings,

1072
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:14,080
they'll look at all the people,
they'll look at literally every 

1073
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,271
component on earth and that computers 
will be so powerful that from seeing 

1074
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:21,650
what exists now and knowing the amount 
of time the earth has existed,

1075
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,890
the computer will be able to paint you 
and incredibly accurate samuel absolute 

1076
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:31,820
simulation of every single action in its
form,

1077
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:36,821
including whatever words you said to a 
girlfriend when you were pissed about 

1078
00:51:36,821 --> 00:51:36,821
that.

1079
00:51:36,821 --> 00:51:41,620
It's all just one gigantic equation.
Every time you hit your horn at a red 

1080
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,000
light,
every time you said,

1081
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,250
fuck yeah,
when highway to hell came on.

1082
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:52,180
All those things,
you can literally know everything that 

1083
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:55,160
happened based on everything that 
exists.

1084
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:55,850
Well,
this is that.

1085
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,470
Yeah.
Why?

1086
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,240
Why you say it doesn't seem possible,
but I don't.

1087
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,241
Fart theory comes into effect.
How do we know if you've heard it or 

1088
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:04,241
not?
Will the but this is the idea,

1089
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:05,270
but you're not really totally paying 
attention.

1090
00:52:05,271 --> 00:52:06,970
I know what I mean.
He was just kidding you.

1091
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,970
Okay.
The idea is that when you can have.

1092
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,530
There's.
There's these things that they're,

1093
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,160
they're coming up with and they were 
like,

1094
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:20,210
they're almost like the size of a large 
grain of sand or like smaller than a 

1095
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:23,540
grain of rice and they can take 
photographs,

1096
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:26,060
video,
they can send images,

1097
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:27,480
Wifi,
wireless,

1098
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:27,950
Lee.

1099
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:31,730
They can also have a gps locator,
tells you exactly where they are.

1100
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,500
So essentially you can have a data bank 
of cameras with dust.

1101
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,470
You can spray dust over a city.
Okay.

1102
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,420
These little powder things,
they'd be everywhere.

1103
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:46,421
You never cleaned them all up and you 
would essentially have a rough picture 

1104
00:52:46,421 --> 00:52:47,990
of everything that's going on all the 
time.

1105
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,720
Yes.
Once you got to that point,

1106
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:55,040
you could get an accurate account of 
everything that exists on the earth.

1107
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,580
All the water,
all the.

1108
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,900
I mean,
it's not outside the realm of 

1109
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:01,900
possibility.
If we can measure right now in our crude

1110
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,410
technological way,
we're 200 years ago,

1111
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:05,750
we were riding animals and they didn't 
have cars.

1112
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:07,670
You couldn't take pictures within 200 
years.

1113
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:10,640
We could do that.
We can tell you how many acres something

1114
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:11,780
is.
We can tell you.

1115
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:16,790
We can do a radio frequency tasks or 
whatever the fuck they do to find out 

1116
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,160
what's in the ground with the is made 
out of.

1117
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,240
We can get a pretty rough account of 
what we've got around us.

1118
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:28,450
Well,
if they can get to a point where they 

1119
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,020
can literally tell you everything that 
exists and have it calculated everything

1120
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:36,711
that exists in this form on earth right 
now and know how long and know what we 

1121
00:53:36,711 --> 00:53:39,600
know about human history and put it all 
into account and be able to actually see

1122
00:53:39,601 --> 00:53:42,090
a recreation of everything that's ever 
happened.

1123
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,960
But here's the thing that the one little
piece you're missing here.

1124
00:53:44,961 --> 00:53:49,961
It's so funny.
You're saying this because I got super 

1125
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:49,961
stone and Vancouver and started thinking
about something like this,

1126
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:52,160
but a good.
Here's the thing you're missing.

1127
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:57,610
Yes,
but you know what that is you just 

1128
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,681
described.
That's a fucking time machine when you 

1129
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:01,991
add one more component to it,
which is a neurological interface that 

1130
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:04,790
instead of it's like you watching it 
places you inside of the recreation,

1131
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:09,970
so now you're able to zoom backwards 
through this like simulated past reality

1132
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,010
based on like,
well if this happened before this,

1133
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:18,011
we can figure out what happened before 
that and there would be a kind of rate 

1134
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:20,210
of entropy to based on like the further 
back you got,

1135
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,530
the less accurate your prediction of 
things that happened would be.

1136
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:29,531
It seems like you wouldn't be.
I don't think you'd be able to 

1137
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:29,531
perfectly.
You wouldn't be able to do smell because

1138
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:32,840
there's no smell technology that know 
all the kinds of smells like apple pie,

1139
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:37,940
like could simulate.
Maybe it could like actually kind of a 

1140
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:37,940
good point.
That's what your theory is.

1141
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:37,940
What was talking about?

1142
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:43,060
Well,
what I'm basing it on though is events 

1143
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:47,330
and like things that have caused,
like why would you ever go to the big 

1144
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:50,781
island you ever been to the big island.
The Big Island is actually the least 

1145
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:52,740
popular lated.
It's less populated than a Wahoo or,

1146
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,440
or a Maui,
but a big one,

1147
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:59,160
half of a side of it is all lava fields.
It's all just like,

1148
00:54:59,161 --> 00:55:02,220
you know that that fucking thing 
exploded like recently,

1149
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:05,130
like within the last who knows how many 
hundred years,

1150
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:10,131
whatever,
and there's lava rock all over the 

1151
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:10,131
place.
If you could,

1152
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,450
you could accurately say,
okay,

1153
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:17,451
well this law has been around for 150 
years and before that it was pastures 

1154
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:17,451
and they actually have photos of it,
you know,

1155
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:17,970
you could,
you could,

1156
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:21,450
you could have hugged the locals.
Describe what happened when in the 18,

1157
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,630
20,
the lava came over the top and cover the

1158
00:55:24,631 --> 00:55:29,631
town.
We can get sort of a pretty decent 

1159
00:55:29,631 --> 00:55:31,401
picture based on stuff like that.
I don't think it's outside of the realm 

1160
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:33,990
of possibility that they can get a 
totally accurate picture of history.

1161
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,520
Oh wait,
here's the other part.

1162
00:55:35,521 --> 00:55:40,521
I forgot this is another piece of 
technology that you need based on the 

1163
00:55:40,521 --> 00:55:42,630
idea that you have this insanely 
advanced computer,

1164
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:43,220
right?
Right.

1165
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,960
And the idea that they could count,
you know,

1166
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,730
what they're doing with the human genome
project.

1167
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:52,731
Somehow they finally pull that off with 
the human brain so that you can start 

1168
00:55:52,731 --> 00:55:55,290
doing brain scans and gather people's 
memories together.

1169
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,530
That's the other piece of it.
So then what you end up having is 

1170
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,201
instead of just having these 
particulates that scan the geographical 

1171
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:08,090
makeup of the planet,
you also have somehow the ability to 

1172
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,910
absorb the memories and the actual,
the actual,

1173
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,590
the memories of human beings.

1174
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:18,950
You imagine though,
if somebody else had to go and access 

1175
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:19,440
your memories,
you'd be like,

1176
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:24,441
what the fuck am I looking at it like 
it's just like bolary legs and you know,

1177
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:29,440
some girls bought where she shows it to 
you and uh,

1178
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:34,710
you know,
a TV show that you barely can remember 

1179
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:34,710
the plot.
I mean,

1180
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:36,490
how fucking accurate is your memory?
I mean,

1181
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:39,130
the idea of tapping into your memories 
and then putting it on.

1182
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,790
You'd be watching like the most retarded
animated Gif file ever.

1183
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:47,930
That's what it would be really crazy.
It would be like a vine video,

1184
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:52,450
but it'll be a little longer.
It would be blurrier and blurrier.

1185
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,430
That's so true,
man.

1186
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:56,640
That's a funny thing you were saying.
That's like an existentialist idea.

1187
00:56:56,641 --> 00:57:01,641
That's an existential idea,
which is this idea of like our actual 

1188
00:57:01,641 --> 00:57:05,181
lives when you consider your pov or so 
the opposite of movies and so the 

1189
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:09,930
opposite of the construct of like some 
beginning and some ending in some middle

1190
00:57:09,931 --> 00:57:14,931
place.
It really is just this blur of like 

1191
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,540
coffee's going into mouth,
turn the radio,

1192
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:20,690
you know,
but it's a significant moments come 

1193
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:24,830
afterwards.
You like sort of decide the significant 

1194
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,471
moments and that's what you were late,
but there's far more moments of just 

1195
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:30,370
driving in between those significant 
moments or walking or like that.

1196
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:31,920
It's a very.
It is a blur.

1197
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,010
Human existence is mostly just a blur.

1198
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,930
Memory is a blur.
Memories.

1199
00:57:36,931 --> 00:57:41,931
Very sketchy.
That's why people don't like Neil 

1200
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:45,411
degrasse Tyson gets out of jury duty,
so as he doesn't trust eye witness 

1201
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:45,411
testimony.
Right.

1202
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:47,850
Get out of here.
But he's right,

1203
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,750
it's been shown to be wrought,
mean people have gone to jail because of

1204
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:54,990
a false eye witness testimony with the 
people who were testifying.

1205
00:57:54,991 --> 00:57:56,870
Yeah.
The people were testifying,

1206
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,560
were absolutely convinced that they were
right,

1207
00:57:58,561 --> 00:58:00,660
but they were wrong and the wrong people
went to jail.

1208
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:02,300
It's been proven.
Sane happens.

1209
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,460
You,
especially when you're under stressful 

1210
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:07,620
situations.
Who knows what the fuck you're seeing,

1211
00:58:07,621 --> 00:58:08,940
what you remember.
You know,

1212
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:13,060
I think a lot of these like bigfoot 
sightings and you know,

1213
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:15,780
an animal wild animal sightings.
I bet there's a lot,

1214
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,840
a lot to that as well.
I think when you're in a stressful 

1215
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:20,840
situation,
you something freaks you out with it's a

1216
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,450
bear or something.

1217
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:26,450
All of a sudden that becomes bigfoot.
You know the mayor runs off and you're 

1218
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:26,450
like,
yeah,

1219
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:26,450
let's fucking bigfoot,
man.

1220
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,490
I swear to God I was big foot,
you know.

1221
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,270
Meanwhile it's midnight in the middle of
Columbus,

1222
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,650
Ohio Woods.
All right.

1223
00:58:31,651 --> 00:58:36,651
You can't see shit out there.
How the fuck do you know if it's 

1224
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:36,651
bigfoot?
Yay.

1225
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:38,130
Columbus Columbus weekend.
You know what I'm saying,

1226
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,820
Duncan?
Yeah,

1227
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:40,070
I do know what you're saying,
man.

1228
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:42,330
Can't trust eye witness testimony.
You can try it.

1229
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,360
Yeah.
If I got a hold of your memories and be 

1230
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,360
like,
Pataki,

1231
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,490
what'd you do to that baby?
And you're like,

1232
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:49,560
no dude.
That was a doll I got.

1233
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:52,650
I got a video in my mind,
a baby

1234
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,990
be getting waterboarded.
It would just be.

1235
00:58:55,290 --> 00:59:00,290
It wouldn't be so exciting.
I think it just be murky and like 

1236
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,180
waterboarding only works on babies and 
little esther.

1237
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:08,240
That would be incredible.
If you water war babies and they start 

1238
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,240
coughing up information,
you everything.

1239
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,890
They know different languages.
I like poopy carrots.

1240
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:15,490
Would would we be.
Would we support waterboarding if.

1241
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,560
If you could interrogate babies and find
out what happened before they were born,

1242
00:59:19,561 --> 00:59:20,700
I think it'd be worth a try.

1243
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,130
We know Alex Jones believes

1244
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,760
at zero.
Dark 30 was a government propaganda film

1245
00:59:25,761 --> 00:59:30,761
supporting terrorism.
That's not how they got that 

1246
00:59:30,761 --> 00:59:32,060
information.
It's a lie.

1247
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,110
Yeah,
man,

1248
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,960
you can't.
You can't torture babies for 

1249
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:40,960
information.
No,

1250
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:40,960
no.
Geneva Convention is going to allow that

1251
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,971
shit too.
They even have a Geneva convention 

1252
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:44,971
anymore.
It's like a Geneva flea market now.

1253
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:47,320
Oh my God.
That didn't even convention.

1254
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:52,670
That was against the Geneva Convention.
There was a button that was like a big 

1255
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:52,670
thing in movies.
Right?

1256
00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:57,610
So it was doing something bad.
They're going against the Geneva 

1257
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:57,610
Convention.
Oh Jesus.

1258
00:59:57,610 --> 00:59:58,000
You.
That's a significant thing.

1259
00:59:58,001 --> 01:00:03,001
It's like the constitution.
It's generally the criminal knows the 

1260
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:03,001
Geneva Convention.
It's like,

1261
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:04,240
you can't do this because of the Geneva 
Convention.

1262
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:08,290
It gets left off the hook.
The Geneva Convention.

1263
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:11,020
We need a.
We need a 2013.

1264
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,920
We made it past the mayans convention.
Just get together and go,

1265
01:00:14,921 --> 01:00:17,410
listen,
let's look at this.

1266
01:00:17,411 --> 01:00:19,360
Realistically when.
That'd be great.

1267
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,750
When that bitch be fucking great.
That's what I love fantasizing about,

1268
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:27,751
man.
I love fucking thinking about that 

1269
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:30,180
fight.
That thing that finally happens when 

1270
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:32,730
everything just.
We finally turn away from these 

1271
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,590
ridiculous,
uh,

1272
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,700
our addiction to leaders.
You know what I mean?

1273
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:40,930
And we turn away from our addiction to 
matter and then God damn it,

1274
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,520
man.
It'd be so fucking awesome.

1275
01:00:42,521 --> 01:00:44,140
We could really.
We could win.

1276
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:47,440
I bet all of humanity just started 
working on it right now.

1277
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:51,780
Together we can whip up a spaceship that
would probably traveled.

1278
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,060
I thought we could have a light speed 
traveling spaceship in 10 years.

1279
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:55,590
I think

1280
01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:00,900
one of the reasons why this podcast 
resonates so much with people is the 

1281
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:06,691
conversations that we have sometimes 
where this is not an alien way of 

1282
01:01:06,911 --> 01:01:08,120
thinking.
This is it.

1283
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:10,390
This is like a really smart way of 
thinking.

1284
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,420
It makes sense and it seems like it 
would be beneficial to all including the

1285
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:18,130
people that are in power,
but if you hear that,

1286
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,350
if you hear someone saying something 
like that,

1287
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,480
you automatically assume that they're a 
fucking little.

1288
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:23,630
No.

1289
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,130
Yeah,
I know you're not allowed to say these 

1290
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:29,130
things.
There's like,

1291
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,570
there's just some basic truths though,
and when you espouse,

1292
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,500
when you say them,
people definitely get weirded out.

1293
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:37,501
Like when you do say the truth,
the truth is continence weren't named 

1294
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:41,731
that for them.
They've already been named that for a 

1295
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:42,040
very short time.
You know,

1296
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:46,750
North America was not North America 2000
years ago.

1297
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,110
You know what I mean?
That.

1298
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:48,920
So you.
So you.

1299
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:54,010
So that's number one.
Number one is the names that we've 

1300
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:54,010
given.
These things are not the real names.

1301
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:55,900
Number two is when you say that this is 
this country,

1302
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,510
well it is right now,
you know,

1303
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,520
it's,
you think it's going to be this country 

1304
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,301
and 500 years,
but for a lot of people it doesn't 

1305
01:02:06,301 --> 01:02:06,301
matter because it is right now,
you know,

1306
01:02:06,301 --> 01:02:07,900
it gives them like a like,
look,

1307
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,570
I'm a fucking American bug off almond 
butter.

1308
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,500
Second Amendment rights are always 
weird.

1309
01:02:14,501 --> 01:02:16,810
This is what America is about.
Always weird,

1310
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:21,910
but America is in a lot of ways about 
those people because those people 

1311
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:23,340
represent a large chunk of the 
population.

1312
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:26,730
The people who want to keep the guns,
the people that you know,

1313
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:30,780
like Nascar and that's what they like.
As long as they're not criminals,

1314
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,260
as long as they pay taxes,
America has to represent that and one of

1315
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:39,261
the ways you got to have some low level 
of patriotism type thing going on with 

1316
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:39,261
them.

1317
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,340
Fuck yeah.
I mean that's legit.

1318
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,930
It works.
It gets people pumped up.

1319
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:48,380
They liked rooting for teams like 
people,

1320
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:53,440
eight black people like tribal thing,
and those teams are always fucking up 

1321
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,030
and went back in the day,
think about there was a great team.

1322
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:01,210
It was called the Christians and the 
witches and there were incinerating 

1323
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,440
fucking witches and that was also part 
of being an American at one time.

1324
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:03,860
Well,
you know,

1325
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:07,310
burning the witches,
killing the Indians.

1326
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:12,460
That's just like part of being a 
Catholic at one time was being an 

1327
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:12,460
inquisitor.
You know what I mean?

1328
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:17,231
It's always weird that the team thing is
greatest from a sentimental perspective 

1329
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:17,450
and it's like,
I get it.

1330
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,400
You want to be an American?
Great.

1331
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,810
You want to love the country?
Great.

1332
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:22,550
I do love this country.
But guess what,

1333
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,710
I love fucking humans.
Do you,

1334
01:03:24,711 --> 01:03:29,711
uh,
do you know the story behind what the 

1335
01:03:29,711 --> 01:03:30,320
latest theory of the witch trials?
Yeah.

1336
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,430
Or got.
Yeah,

1337
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,130
tripping balls.
Yeah.

1338
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:34,120
Yeah,
that's awesome.

1339
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:39,470
The latest theory involves a premature 
for frost,

1340
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:40,390
like,
uh,

1341
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,620
they were growing wheat apparently.
And uh,

1342
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,770
when,
when they have like a frost,

1343
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,350
when the plants freeze and then thaw 
out,

1344
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:52,100
sometimes they get weird funguses.
And this one,

1345
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,160
they did some soil samples and they 
found that there was sometime around 

1346
01:03:58,431 --> 01:04:03,431
that area around whether it was doing 
the Salem witch trials was they had 

1347
01:04:03,431 --> 01:04:07,850
early frost and they had the.
I think they found evidence of this 

1348
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:08,540
stuff,
this or God stuff.

1349
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:12,040
It's very common though and on wheat and
what it.

1350
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,080
It's like acid.
I mean it's basically very similar to 

1351
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,080
take in house.
That's awesome.

1352
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:17,930
If that's true.
Well they bought.

1353
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:20,570
They're almost positive.
They're almost positive.

1354
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:26,020
That means scientifically it all lines 
up because they know that it's happened 

1355
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,411
before that people have gotten.
They've gotten wheat that's been 

1356
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,360
poisoned by it and they've gotten sick 
and they've had hallucinations.

1357
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:37,570
So if you've got a whole country or a 
whole city that's eating the wheat for 

1358
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,110
who knows how long that's filled with 
God.

1359
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:45,250
But there's some speculation as to 
whether or not it would be still 

1360
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,120
psychoactive after you baked it.
I've seen people that disagree with it,

1361
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,260
but in my opinion,
I mean it.

1362
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,750
It seems to be a likely

1363
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,100
candidate.
Well,

1364
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:56,700
there's also the thing where there was 
like an oppressive religious structure,

1365
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,850
confusing people and are thinking that 
there was a devil.

1366
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:05,090
Yeah,
he could just be a high level 

1367
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:05,090
percolation of crazy.
It could just be let's burn,

1368
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:05,540
which is let's take the ship to the next
level

1369
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,010
and then,
you know,

1370
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:09,050
we got to blame it on something because 
I mean,

1371
01:05:09,051 --> 01:05:10,360
you look at the stuff that,
I mean,

1372
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,990
people are getting burned as witches in 
Africa right now and they're not.

1373
01:05:13,991 --> 01:05:14,120
There's

1374
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,480
no,
there's no ergot.

1375
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,600
Usually there's just a bunch of Horny,
angry guys who want to fucking torch a 

1376
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,820
bitch.
That's what it is,

1377
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:23,410
man.
And it's like also,

1378
01:05:23,411 --> 01:05:24,100
it's,
it's the,

1379
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:24,970
it's the,
uh,

1380
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,220
it's the uh,
you know,

1381
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:27,940
it's,
it's the,

1382
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:31,680
it's the bad version of like the,
of the,

1383
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,360
of what they call the patriarchy to.
I mean,

1384
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:37,420
the fucking witch burnings.
We're just the same as us,

1385
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:39,670
like killing the Indians in a different 
way.

1386
01:05:39,671 --> 01:05:44,671
It was like there was a religion that 
existed before Catholicism came rolling 

1387
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:49,480
through planet earth and that religion 
was what we call paganism.

1388
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,430
She's country dwellers is what that 
means.

1389
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,790
Just people who are more in tune with 
the earth knew about herbs and stuff,

1390
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,300
didn't.
Um,

1391
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:56,530
that's why,
you know,

1392
01:05:56,531 --> 01:06:01,531
all of our holidays are fucking weird.
All of our holidays are.

1393
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:06,820
They'll mismatch there.
All mismatched weird shit that we don't 

1394
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,781
really understand based on Jupiter and 
like just strange fucking looper Kalia 

1395
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:12,670
is what Valentine's Day is,
is looper Kalia.

1396
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:14,710
You know about that.
You know what looper Kalia was?

1397
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,170
What's a park?
Holly is fucking crazy,

1398
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:22,171
man.
You would get like am Valentine's Day 

1399
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:22,171
around Valentine's Day is called the 
festival looper.

1400
01:06:22,171 --> 01:06:25,060
Cali and looper was some kind of Wolf 
God that the Romans worshiped.

1401
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,100
So what you would do is you would,
um,

1402
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:30,250
as I recall,
I looked it up on wikipedia.

1403
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,560
You can look it up guys,
and you'll find a much more detailed,

1404
01:06:32,561 --> 01:06:34,480
not spelled ultimate looper.
Kalia,

1405
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:38,650
L U P E R c a l A.
Yeah.

1406
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:43,651
Read that Shit.
That's what Valentine's Day used to be 

1407
01:06:43,651 --> 01:06:45,820
a.
But St Valentine of course was a saint.

1408
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,870
A Catholic saint.

1409
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,030
Yeah.
Looper.

1410
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,470
Kelly.
That's how you spell it.

1411
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:51,160
Looper.
Cali.

1412
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,390
Um.
Wow.

1413
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,440
This is amazing.
Yeah,

1414
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,930
it's interesting.
It's very interesting.

1415
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,290
Ancient.
Possibly pre Roman pastoral festival 

1416
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:04,800
observed on February 13th through 15th 
to avert evil spirits and purify the 

1417
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:07,510
city releasing health and fertility,

1418
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,040
but read what they did,
dude.

1419
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:13,610
They whipped,
they like,

1420
01:07:13,611 --> 01:07:15,960
or they will,
like there was flogging involved in this

1421
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:19,950
festival is very strange,
but that's what,

1422
01:07:19,951 --> 01:07:20,770
you know,
that,

1423
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:23,640
that proceeded.
That was the religion that proceeded,

1424
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,720
uh,
uh,

1425
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,020
the one that is the currently the 
dominant religion and,

1426
01:07:30,021 --> 01:07:32,340
and that old religion didn't get,
didn't,

1427
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:33,450
they weren't just like,
you know what,

1428
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,520
we're not going to worship the wolf.
Got Anymore.

1429
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:39,540
It was that they were getting torched 
and I don't think it was based on eating

1430
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:42,000
like fungus.
I think it was because the,

1431
01:07:42,001 --> 01:07:42,640
uh,
the,

1432
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,630
it's to combating paradigms that,
that didn't.

1433
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:48,380
They don't work together at all.
And uh,

1434
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,380
I'm not saying either one isn't 
necessarily logical,

1435
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:55,200
but one is more based on the way the 
earth works.

1436
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,440
And the other one is based on the way 
like old dudes try to control people.

1437
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:04,080
That's where that,
that's,

1438
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,250
that's the,
I mean,

1439
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,040
this whole fucking pope thing.
To me,

1440
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:13,070
it's crazy and hilarious that we even 
pay attention to what that clown is 

1441
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:14,430
doing.
How is that even making the news?

1442
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:19,431
There's some weird fucking group of 
people who do like the most bizarre 

1443
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,570
ceremonies who I mentioned sanctioned by

1444
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:26,700
governments in mass media.
No one calls it a call to the guy's 

1445
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,720
wearing a fucking wizard out with a fish
head hat.

1446
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,930
It's if you try to do that today and 
tried to say,

1447
01:08:31,931 --> 01:08:34,600
I am a daughter of God.
He has brought to me this information.

1448
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:37,720
He tried to set up a shop.
They would think you were fucking loon,

1449
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,270
but because of the fact that it's been 
around for a long time,

1450
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:41,680
this guy has a direct lineage.

1451
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:46,910
We're supposed to take it serious where 
he's supposed to take it seriously and 

1452
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:47,850
we're supposed to fucking ignore all the
Shit Catholicism did.

1453
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:48,630
Well,
how about this shit

1454
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:53,660
he did.
He released a priest that had molested 

1455
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,280
200 deaf boys,
200.

1456
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,330
He let them go,
Huh?

1457
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:02,390
He let them go into psychiatric.
Instead of bringing in and getting them 

1458
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:06,711
prosecuted,
they brought them in for psychiatric 

1459
01:09:06,711 --> 01:09:08,661
treatment and this guy went on to.
They went to another parish and he 

1460
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:08,661
molested more boys.
I mean,

1461
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:11,070
it's fucking craziness.
He did that time and time again.

1462
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:16,250
He took people away from being 
prosecuted and sent them to psychiatric 

1463
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,200
care and and they're free.
They're free to go.

1464
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,210
They're free and they're walking around 
the street.

1465
01:09:19,211 --> 01:09:24,211
Some of them are in these huge religious
retreat places that they have beautiful 

1466
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:28,701
grounds and these guys are just 
wandering around taking care of for the 

1467
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:28,701
rest of their lives and the trauma.

1468
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:29,570
There's a place like that where I live 
or.

1469
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:30,060
Yeah,
there.

1470
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,250
Yeah.
So.

1471
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:36,520
Right.
So that's happening and they don't pay 

1472
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:36,520
taxes.
They don't pay fucking taxes.

1473
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,100
That is fucking okay.

1474
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,010
Crazy.
All that shit is crazy.

1475
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:43,480
The idea that they should be able to 
make golden buildings and not pay taxes.

1476
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,370
Bitch,
are you out of your fucking mind?

1477
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,930
Can you fucking imagine that's a 
business?

1478
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,800
It's a business.
It's a fucking business.

1479
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:51,860
You're not.
No.

1480
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:54,110
You don't talk directly directly for 
God.

1481
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:56,240
It's 2013.
Stop.

1482
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:59,270
Stop your bullshit.
You're not telling the truth,

1483
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,430
you don't know that much.
I don't believe you.

1484
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:06,580
I think you are very charismatic and 
there's a lot of people that want to 

1485
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,100
believe you and they'll go along with 
it,

1486
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,790
but you're talking crazy.
God's not talking

1487
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,040
can new stupid.
No,

1488
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:16,041
you're an asshole.
You're an asshole and you'd taken their 

1489
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:18,240
money and we got to make sure that this 
stops with our generation.

1490
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,670
We got to make sure that future 
generations don't.

1491
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:24,780
They don't have a gigantic religious 
leader.

1492
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:29,190
Someone who tells them based on some 
nutty shit that was written thousands of

1493
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:30,860
years ago by people drew on animal skin,

1494
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,040
but also it spreads that the way that 
looks with [inaudible] is just one 

1495
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,510
version of the problem.
The other problem is the guy who calls,

1496
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:40,760
you know there's like an in the way 
there's a pope.

1497
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:42,740
There's also a dude who calls himself 
the president,

1498
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:47,300
but instead of representing some 
phantasmo forest called God,

1499
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,690
he says,
I represent the will of the people.

1500
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,930
Yet he doesn't really represent the will
of the people.

1501
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,450
It doesn't seem like that when he goes 
to when,

1502
01:10:56,451 --> 01:11:01,451
when,
when they do the polls and that as it 

1503
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:01,451
turns out,
you know,

1504
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:01,451
and I'm not just the president,
of course,

1505
01:11:01,451 --> 01:11:06,191
the government as a whole,
the president doesn't have to tell 

1506
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:08,690
attarian power,
but I don't think that the president 

1507
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:11,231
really represents the will of the people
and I don't think Congress represents 

1508
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:12,710
the will of the people and I don't think
Senate represents the will of the people

1509
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,640
any more than the pope represents the 
will of God and I think it's this image,

1510
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:21,710
this imaginary thing that we're supposed
to believe in because it makes us feel 

1511
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,191
more comfortable as though these people 
are really enacting the will of the 

1512
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:25,191
people.

1513
01:11:25,191 --> 01:11:27,360
I think the will of the people is that 
we want peace.

1514
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:30,420
We want to be able to like,
we do want security,

1515
01:11:30,421 --> 01:11:35,421
we want education,
but we don't want fucking war war with 

1516
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:38,490
Iran.
We don't want fucking war with Iraq,

1517
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,480
Iraq,
Iraq.

1518
01:11:39,481 --> 01:11:44,481
How the fuck do you say?
And I forgot to say that I got some 

1519
01:11:44,481 --> 01:11:44,481
start up.
We don't want it.

1520
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,390
Nobody wants war.
And if there is,

1521
01:11:46,391 --> 01:11:50,100
it's a small faction of people,
sweaty red face cock suckers,

1522
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:55,310
you know,
or like that awful thin fucking 

1523
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,330
scarecrow con and coulter,
Jesus Christ,

1524
01:11:57,331 --> 01:12:01,530
she's like something that Baphomet 
fucking coughed up like a hairball.

1525
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:04,610
That Satan or rejected.
Did you see her getting booted?

1526
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,710
The Libertarian Convention.
This fucking.

1527
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:11,280
Oh,
she fucking had the audacity,

1528
01:12:11,281 --> 01:12:12,810
like in front of the Libertarian 
Convention,

1529
01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:15,430
she said they were asking her like,
you know,

1530
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:18,090
do you think gay people can get married?
And she's like,

1531
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:20,910
yes,
gay people can get married to members of

1532
01:12:20,911 --> 01:12:22,080
the opposite sex.

1533
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:25,860
You Bitch,
you dirty tap dancing.

1534
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,920
Scandal is bitch.
She's such a beast,

1535
01:12:28,921 --> 01:12:29,880
man.
So anyway,

1536
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:33,870
what I'm saying is there's a small,
there's a small faction of these pigs.

1537
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:39,170
You know what I mean?
That grabbed the spotlight and produced 

1538
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:39,170
this illusion.
And,

1539
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:39,170
and,
and,

1540
01:12:39,170 --> 01:12:43,591
and,
and certainly the one of the great 

1541
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:44,130
illusions is the idea that the pope 
represents God.

1542
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:48,450
Governments represent the people.
Television represents reality.

1543
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,630
What we have happening on this planet is
a dramatic cases of misrepresentation 

1544
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:57,840
coming from a small minority of people 
who've managed to grab power.

1545
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,750
And this creates an illusion that people
try to live by,

1546
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:05,751
and the reason everything's all fucked 
up is because it's not based on what's 

1547
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:05,751
really happening.

1548
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:10,580
Yeah,
and I believe that's one of the reasons 

1549
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,351
why government likes to keep religion in
positions of power and keep them tax 

1550
01:13:12,351 --> 01:13:15,600
free because it helps when people are in
big groups.

1551
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:20,601
It helps when people are already 
indoctrinated to the rules of the group 

1552
01:13:20,601 --> 01:13:23,310
because then you're more likely to be a 
person who listens to rules.

1553
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:28,730
The real issue with absolving all 
religion is not the denial of the 

1554
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:33,051
existence of God,
but the denial of man's knowledge of 

1555
01:13:33,051 --> 01:13:33,600
exactly what God is,
who God is,

1556
01:13:33,601 --> 01:13:38,601
what God wants,
and instead I could do is base it on the

1557
01:13:38,971 --> 01:13:42,230
wisdom of ancient teachings that we know
to be true today.

1558
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:47,510
Lot of that is real.
Being able to treat people the way you 

1559
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:48,060
would want to be treated yourself,
in fact,

1560
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:50,430
treat people as if they were you living 
another life.

1561
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:52,680
That's how I.
I literally try to do that.

1562
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,260
I try to do that.
Gets a little taxing when you're like,

1563
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:57,240
why am I such a fucking loser?
And this other life,

1564
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,250
you know,
it gets annoying,

1565
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:02,070
why am I a dickhead and this other life.
But if you,

1566
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,520
if you just think about some of the 
things that people associate with 

1567
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,490
religion,
the,

1568
01:14:08,491 --> 01:14:09,060
the,
the,

1569
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:09,450
the,
uh,

1570
01:14:09,451 --> 01:14:14,451
the ideas,
the good ideas of charity and love and 

1571
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,030
family and the values of virtue in your 
ethics and the way you think of,

1572
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:17,340
of your,
your,

1573
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:22,440
your fellow citizens,
your fellow humans that you're in this 

1574
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:22,440
colony with,
that's,

1575
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,280
those are all really super positive for 
the most part.

1576
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,760
It's mixed in with a lot of scare 
tactics and fear and nonsense.

1577
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:30,460
And who knows when that was all added.
That's the real problem.

1578
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:35,110
But we know when we feel great,
we know when we feel filled with love,

1579
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:37,510
when we know when our life is at its 
best.

1580
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:42,510
And it's real simple.
It's being around people that you also 

1581
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:42,880
love.
They love you,

1582
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:45,100
you're unconditional,
you're all friendly,

1583
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,750
you're all happy and not having a bunch 
of shit that bothers you as far as like,

1584
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,030
man,
I should have been a singer or man,

1585
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,920
I should've played baseball,
or man,

1586
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:55,750
I should have given it a shot.
Or man,

1587
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,130
why didn't I call her that night sale?
Sorry,

1588
01:14:58,131 --> 01:15:00,010
but I have to be whatever the fuck it 
is.

1589
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,230
Whatever it is,
when you have regret,

1590
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:04,690
when you're in that weird state of 
regret.

1591
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,120
I'm very extreme with that because I 
tried to be like,

1592
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:12,410
I'm very harsh on myself as far as like 
a monitoring what negativity and 

1593
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:15,350
positivity and making sure that I'm in 
like a,

1594
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:19,510
a good,
a good track and when you,

1595
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:24,511
when you judge yourself to be like in a 
bad place or that can really distract 

1596
01:15:24,511 --> 01:15:25,600
all of your creativity.

1597
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:30,900
When it can,
it can completely fuck with any new 

1598
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:33,790
positive things that are moving forward.
It's instead you've gone onto correction

1599
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:38,791
duty.
Then you have to look at like how did 

1600
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:38,890
this sort of behavior manifests itself?
What was the cause?

1601
01:15:38,891 --> 01:15:41,040
Is it alcohol induced?
There's an insecurity and Derek's like,

1602
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:41,550
what?
What,

1603
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:46,570
what happened or that were the 
combinations of factors that led you to 

1604
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:46,570
be a Douche bag,
you know,

1605
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:46,720
and yeah.
Yeah.

1606
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:47,770
What was,
what was,

1607
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,500
what was wrong with,
you know,

1608
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:55,000
that made you have a mediocre set.
What was the thing that was bugging you?

1609
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:56,900
Were you sat in front of your computer 
for two hours,

1610
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,330
you couldn't write chet.
What is that?

1611
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:00,280
Well,
you got to stop whatever that is,

1612
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:05,050
stop whatever that is and make sure that
doesn't happen again and we have to sort

1613
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:07,000
of figure that out along the way.

1614
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:12,350
We.
And that's one of the weirdest things 

1615
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:13,951
about being a human is we're all sort of
figuring this out as this thing is in 

1616
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,781
motion.
And I always equate it to being like we 

1617
01:16:18,781 --> 01:16:21,601
woke up in the middle of a starship 
that's hurling towards the planet and 

1618
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:25,690
we're like waking up,
hitting all the instruments going,

1619
01:16:25,691 --> 01:16:26,770
okay,
where are we?

1620
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,620
We're going $75,
million miles an hour.

1621
01:16:29,630 --> 01:16:30,940
How close is that planet?
Okay.

1622
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:32,380
Are we gonna?
Are we gonna?

1623
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:37,381
Hit that plan.
Does anybody know how to wear the 

1624
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:37,381
breaks?
You just think turn.

1625
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:37,381
Okay.
What happened?

1626
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:40,390
How did we get here?
Who built this fucking ship and how long

1627
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:43,970
we've been asleep.
I mean we literally are in the middle of

1628
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:45,430
a,
not just a process,

1629
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:50,431
but like a journey,
a process of constant reevaluation and 

1630
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:54,811
ingenuity and innovation where this 
technology that we're surrounded by 

1631
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:59,050
increasing in its power and ability like
tenfold every couple of years.

1632
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,580
So like he's crazy quantum levels where 
they're coming up with quantum computing

1633
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:08,581
and they're talking about the ability to
put google glasses on and communicate 

1634
01:17:08,581 --> 01:17:09,800
with the fucking world all at the same 
time.

1635
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:15,400
There's this,
this time that we're at right now is 

1636
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:15,400
just,
it's,

1637
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:20,200
it's almost as if we pick the perfect 
spot for the most action,

1638
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:26,860
like the perfect spot for like the birth
and emergence of technology into the 

1639
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:29,390
forefront of mankind.
Well,

1640
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:34,391
you know that a lot of new age or a say 
is that the reason that the earth is so 

1641
01:17:35,121 --> 01:17:40,121
populated right now is because so many 
different beings from infinity,

1642
01:17:40,191 --> 01:17:43,760
from the multiverse or wanting to 
incarnate right now because it's such an

1643
01:17:43,761 --> 01:17:48,761
exciting thing happening to the planet.
That's a great way of looking at why are

1644
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:52,450
there so many entities and currently 
right now because there's only,

1645
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,000
you only get one thing like this thing 
went up.

1646
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,270
Planet pops,
you know,

1647
01:17:56,271 --> 01:17:59,360
and it like wakes up.
It's like a really beautiful thing to be

1648
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:00,620
a part of.
I love them.

1649
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:03,050
I love that model.
I don't necessarily believe it.

1650
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:08,130
And you have love that.
That's a very empowering Melissa 

1651
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:10,571
etheridge style model,
but it's mostly because porn is more 

1652
01:18:10,571 --> 01:18:12,080
accepted and people are having more 
crazy sex and are open about sex.

1653
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:17,081
Right?
What younger people are having sex 

1654
01:18:17,081 --> 01:18:20,171
younger.
That's why there's so much of a 

1655
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:20,171
population boom at this time because.
No,

1656
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:20,171
no,
no,

1657
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:20,520
no,
no,

1658
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:21,290
no,
no,

1659
01:18:21,291 --> 01:18:26,291
no,
because fuck exactly the same amount of 

1660
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:26,291
porn and Oh,
poor,

1661
01:18:26,291 --> 01:18:29,210
poor and actually probably stops them 
from fucking as much because they jerk 

1662
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:32,171
off.
I don't believe that the early 1900 

1663
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:32,171
[inaudible] it's all about family and 
stuff.

1664
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:34,040
People aren't having crazy sex or you 
know,

1665
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:39,100
your history son.
What do you think the roaring twenties 

1666
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:39,320
were those all people fucking like wild 
animals.

1667
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,580
Doctors were giving abortions?
No,

1668
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,860
it wasn't in New York City,
man.

1669
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,860
I think your perceptions of the world 
are a little off.

1670
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:50,890
The thing that brought people were very 
conservative back to being conservative 

1671
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,190
was the great depression.
So before the Great Depression,

1672
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:53,990
which was in the 19 thirties,
we,

1673
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:58,130
they were fucking going bananas.
People were going crazy and that was the

1674
01:18:58,131 --> 01:19:00,650
roaring twenties.
They had speakeasies checks were getting

1675
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:05,651
banged dudes.
We're living in a bachelor or putting 

1676
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:05,651
cocaine and coke.
Yeah,

1677
01:19:05,651 --> 01:19:08,930
dudes were living a bachelor life to the
point where pool halls were.

1678
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,960
There was I think four times more pool 
halls in New York City than there are 

1679
01:19:14,331 --> 01:19:18,950
starbucks today.
There were over a thousand pool halls in

1680
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:21,980
New York City at the turn of the century
because people were.

1681
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:24,920
Kids were gambling.
What do you mean kids like young,

1682
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,160
like nowadays that the average person 
having sex for the first time,

1683
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:31,970
it was like 14,
15 years old back then was probably 21,

1684
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,430
22.

1685
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:32,850
No,
no,

1686
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:34,190
no.
You're wrong.

1687
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:35,000
No wrong.
Yeah,

1688
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:35,950
you're wrong.
Yeah,

1689
01:19:35,951 --> 01:19:36,970
no people.
It's.

1690
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:42,200
We always have.
People have always had sex at a young 

1691
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:43,370
age.
Boys and girls have gotten together at a

1692
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:47,750
young age forever and fucked.
I don't imagine that there's any more or

1693
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:50,270
less fucking than has ever existed 
amongst teenagers.

1694
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:52,520
If you leave them alone,
they fuck you know,

1695
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:54,920
and who fucks more than Catholic school 
girls.

1696
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,230
You really think religion.
Religion is going to stop you.

1697
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,050
Religious is not stopping a crazy bitch 
with a,

1698
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:05,120
with a moist pussy.
If you leave almost any animal alone 

1699
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:05,120
with it.
Fuck,

1700
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,440
I don't buy that.
I don't buy that.

1701
01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:10,650
But the conservatism that we think of 
from like the 19 fifties will,

1702
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:15,390
that was in response to the fact that 
Hitler had just come along and world war

1703
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:18,330
two came along and our grandparents had 
to fight the Nazis.

1704
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:23,660
You know,
my grandfather worked in a plant that 

1705
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:25,431
made a part for the atomic bomb.
That was always the big thing that they 

1706
01:20:25,431 --> 01:20:25,431
were.
What do you brag around the house?

1707
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,360
You know,
a grandpa makes a,

1708
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:30,540
a part in his factory that is for the 
atomic bomb.

1709
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:32,330
You know?
So the,

1710
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,340
the,
the conservatism that I think that came 

1711
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:37,340
in the 19 fifties,
the fear,

1712
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,370
the McCarthy era,
when everybody's like,

1713
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:43,371
you comment someone's a comment.
So we were worried about Russia doing 

1714
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:43,510
the same shit we had just seen the Nazis
do.

1715
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,900
So then the sixties come along,
boom.

1716
01:20:45,901 --> 01:20:48,690
Everybody finds drugs and free love and 
hippy shit.

1717
01:20:48,691 --> 01:20:50,340
And the government is like,
what the fuck?

1718
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,390
Like stop this,
like we're losing all the government saw

1719
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:58,350
a bunch of soft men running around in 
sandals getting raped by Russians.

1720
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:03,470
The Russians just come over here and 
just store my beaches and kick us into 

1721
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,480
the fucking dirt.
Everyone's on acid.

1722
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:08,510
Nobody wants to fight anymore.
We're going to get overtaken by the 

1723
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:08,510
Russians.
Not commies are everywhere.

1724
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:09,780
Did you go to the communist manifesto?
Dinner?

1725
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,600
I just want to know is all about black 
list head.

1726
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,920
There was like a wild frenzy to stop the
drugs and to stop,

1727
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,520
stop communism and establish the hippy 
bullshit and,

1728
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:25,521
and you know,
and put more power back to the 

1729
01:21:25,521 --> 01:21:25,521
government.

1730
01:21:25,521 --> 01:21:25,710
Well that's the,
that's the thing I,

1731
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,170
I've been thinking,
dude,

1732
01:21:27,171 --> 01:21:27,770
is,
is it.

1733
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:32,850
I think that there's basically two 
religions in the world and that one 

1734
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:37,541
religion is a religion.
Religions pray that wrong or for when I 

1735
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:40,600
got cancer,
my mom's dying.

1736
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:45,820
I've had a weird fucking year and in all
the turbulence man like behind it,

1737
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:52,750
this is what's crazy.
Batch really severe catastrophic things 

1738
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:55,730
happening in your life is like,
and why they call it an apocalypse.

1739
01:21:55,731 --> 01:21:58,670
Personal apocalypse.
Apocalypse means lifting of the veil.

1740
01:21:58,671 --> 01:22:03,671
You know,
it's like you see this fucking thing 

1741
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:08,740
behind all the turbulence.
It's really weird after you've like 

1742
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,900
gotten the initial prognosis or after 
you find out the bad news that you know,

1743
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:16,901
you go into shock kind of and then that 
faith and you pace around the process 

1744
01:22:16,901 --> 01:22:19,970
process and in this fades away and this 
fucking thing hit me.

1745
01:22:20,360 --> 01:22:22,160
You know,
and I felt it when I've been on a lot of

1746
01:22:22,161 --> 01:22:27,161
psychedelics.
I think you've kind of talked about it 

1747
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:27,770
and you're your dmt trip story,
but God damn it.

1748
01:22:27,771 --> 01:22:32,771
It's this fucking thing behind 
everything that's saying everything's 

1749
01:22:32,771 --> 01:22:32,771
gonna.
Be Okay.

1750
01:22:32,771 --> 01:22:35,960
Everything's gonna.
Be Oh k.

1751
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:38,060
and you feel it.
It's not bullshit.

1752
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:40,790
You're not delusional.
You really pick up on this thing,

1753
01:22:41,050 --> 01:22:46,050
what you feel is that you're caught up 
in the idea of this small loop being the

1754
01:22:47,531 --> 01:22:52,531
big picture,
that this small loop represents your 

1755
01:22:52,531 --> 01:22:56,461
reality and it's so important to you 
because you have loved ones and because 

1756
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:58,570
you have car payments and because you 
have a job that you enjoy,

1757
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:03,900
it's so important you this loop,
but then it allows you to see that this 

1758
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:08,401
loop is just a and an infinite ball of 
yarn that goes on forever and you and 

1759
01:23:09,411 --> 01:23:10,950
you look at it and just go,
okay,

1760
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:12,910
and it's going,
it's going to be okay.

1761
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,340
You're like,
okay.

1762
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:18,650
Because you realize that life in the 
universe and everything we find 

1763
01:23:20,890 --> 01:23:25,890
everywhere we look,
it's fractal and that it all is infinite

1764
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:32,320
big.
All of it is infinitely small and 

1765
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:32,680
infinitely big and it exists everywhere 
we look.

1766
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:34,030
There's no.
We never found.

1767
01:23:34,031 --> 01:23:34,870
Well,
this is the end.

1768
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,820
This is the end of matter.
Here it is.

1769
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Yeah.
It hits a wall and then there's nothing 

1770
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
behind it.
No,

1771
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:42,000
there's no wall,
man.

1772
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,480
It goes down to subatomic particles that
blink in and out of existence.

1773
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,600
They're in a super position,
so they're in two different places at 

1774
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,971
one time.
They're moving and still at the same 

1775
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:50,971
time.
It's fucking madness.

1776
01:23:50,971 --> 01:23:54,931
They disappear and they come back.
We don't know where the fuck they went 

1777
01:23:54,931 --> 01:23:56,620
and they can measure it,
but they don't know what it means.

1778
01:23:57,250 --> 01:24:02,250
And so I,
I feel like it's probably gotta be that 

1779
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:06,570
with just life in general and 
everything.

1780
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:11,910
Consciousness in general.
I think we're clinging onto this one 

1781
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:16,530
particular consciousness and this one 
particular moment in time because I 

1782
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:20,740
think the human race is here to do 
something.

1783
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,140
I think we're a part of a process like 
bees making honey or aunts making an ant

1784
01:24:25,141 --> 01:24:30,141
hill and that all of our wackiness,
whether it's ego or sexuality or you 

1785
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:35,950
know,
the need to conquer whatever these 

1786
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,131
things are,
they're all a part of this gigantic 

1787
01:24:38,131 --> 01:24:39,850
calculation to bring us technologically 
to the next level.

1788
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:43,150
Whether it's because we're worried about
the other guys doing it first.

1789
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,480
Whether it's because you know,
and that's how the,

1790
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:51,500
the,
the movement represents itself 

1791
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:51,990
represents itself through the fear of 
military conquest by the,

1792
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,200
the other.
So we have to hit this technological 

1793
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:57,200
superiority first,
like sorta like the moon race.

1794
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,070
You know,
what,

1795
01:24:58,071 --> 01:24:59,230
whatever the fuck it is.
I,

1796
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:00,130
I,
when I,

1797
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:05,131
when I look at the,
the idea of our inability to grasp what 

1798
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:11,881
we're doing and our continued movement 
in the same crazy direction like 

1799
01:25:11,881 --> 01:25:16,120
especially when it comes to war and,
and the lack of respect people have for 

1800
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:21,390
poor people and the lower classes and 
the lack of resources that are put into 

1801
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:23,110
raising the backup.
I almost look at it like it's,

1802
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:28,710
it's natural.
If you look at every other animal's 

1803
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:32,401
behavior,
whether it's wolves and the Alpha Beta 

1804
01:25:32,401 --> 01:25:32,680
representative in the wolf pack and you 
know,

1805
01:25:32,681 --> 01:25:35,680
the way they have the social world 
structured,

1806
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:36,910
even if it's cruel.

1807
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,910
We see bears eat their cubs.
We understand that this is nature bears 

1808
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,390
one of their favorite things to do.
Grizzlies,

1809
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:48,510
they get up earlier before the females 
do in the spring and they go and hunt 

1810
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:51,961
for baby baby bears.
They're going to go into the dense on 

1811
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:53,290
purpose to eat the babies a phase.
Yeah,

1812
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,670
motherfuckers.
Right?

1813
01:25:54,671 --> 01:25:56,700
But that's natural.
And we know that's natural.

1814
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,870
So we see it and we go,
well that's natural.

1815
01:25:58,871 --> 01:26:00,970
That's what nature wants.
It's we,

1816
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:04,880
we're the only thing that we,
that can stop nature.

1817
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
We can stop the equation.
We feel like we are intelligent and 

1818
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,201
aware and we are capable of stopping the
equation that we find ourselves in and 

1819
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,970
I'm not so sure if that even makes 
sense.

1820
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,750
Here's why.
This is the thing.

1821
01:26:18,751 --> 01:26:21,320
I thought I was reading this great book 
about Ip holders,

1822
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:21,680
so.
Yeah,

1823
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:22,590
sure.
Dr Brian.

1824
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:27,540
He'll tell you about boners.
Brian,

1825
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:32,630
what?
What about that new ps four that you're 

1826
01:26:34,691 --> 01:26:35,830
not excited about it,
Huh?

1827
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:36,880
No,
I don't care.

1828
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:45,180
I'm mildly excited about it.
I'm excited about the next generation of

1829
01:26:45,221 --> 01:26:47,680
these things coming out.
Not as excited about the new xbox,

1830
01:26:47,681 --> 01:26:49,750
but I think it was pretty cool.
Have you been playing games at all?

1831
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,850
I haven't.
I haven't really been playing games.

1832
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:57,810
Yeah.
I love playing this game called far cry 

1833
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:57,810
three.
Oh,

1834
01:26:57,810 --> 01:26:58,200
you really?
Yeah.

1835
01:26:58,240 --> 01:26:59,950
That's what we're changing the game for 
you.

1836
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,160
Well,
it's funny because the characters in it 

1837
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:05,160
are Douche bags,
like they're like,

1838
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:09,010
they're really a cheesy storyline.
It's like a bunch of actors get 

1839
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:12,571
kidnapped by like tribal peppers and 
it's very funny that the way that they 

1840
01:27:12,571 --> 01:27:16,831
communicate with each other,
like we're going to get back to Santa 

1841
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:16,831
Monica,
Bro.

1842
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:18,280
It's really weird,
you know,

1843
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:18,850
like they've,
like,

1844
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:21,790
they all were in the film industry or 
something,

1845
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,740
so it's cheesy.
It's like a chance to.

1846
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:26,980
And also like the main character as he 
progresses,

1847
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:31,030
gets a tribal armband that keeps growing
on his arm.

1848
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:36,031
Like it's definitely the game seems to 
have been made by somebody who is like 

1849
01:27:36,031 --> 01:27:38,560
definitely into techno and cocaine,
but it's still a very fun game.

1850
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:43,920
Little Esther's watching us right now 
and I've been having a side 

1851
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,610
conversation.
She wants to get fake boobs for real.

1852
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,050
She's just trolling,
you know,

1853
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,750
she's,
she really does want to fake boobs.

1854
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:51,550
She has a nice rug.
That girl.

1855
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,020
You try to think of him.

1856
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:58,570
Yeah.
I've never seen a little asterisk boobs.

1857
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:01,440
Apologize for that.
I'm usually very professional.

1858
01:28:01,441 --> 01:28:03,420
What comes to my urine?
He gotta go,

1859
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:08,550
you gotta go drink a Kombucha.
Before the whole foods started getting 

1860
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,010
the new Kombucha is in again.
Do you know that a Kombucha tea,

1861
01:28:11,011 --> 01:28:14,580
like when you get it like Gts,
Kombucha or synergy?

1862
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:20,080
They.
It was like more than one half of one 

1863
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:22,491
percent alcohol.
So you had to be over 21 to buy and you 

1864
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:25,951
still have to be over 21 to buy it,
but they just got it back on the 

1865
01:28:25,951 --> 01:28:26,160
shelves.
They had like a diluted form of it.

1866
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,860
We just still healthy.
The kombucha still good,

1867
01:28:28,861 --> 01:28:32,340
but it's not as good as the.
The True fermented live culture,

1868
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:33,750
Huh?
Yeah.

1869
01:28:33,751 --> 01:28:37,230
It's fucking delicious.
So good.

1870
01:28:37,231 --> 01:28:38,850
You get.
If you did get a taste for that.

1871
01:28:38,851 --> 01:28:43,851
It's so healthy.
I'll drink a diet coke and feel like a 

1872
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:43,851
loser.
I just like,

1873
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:43,851
what am I doing?

1874
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,900
What am I doing?
Do I want to fuck my body up?

1875
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:50,901
Like why?
I'd rather drink a coke because I know 

1876
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:50,901
it's just fatty.
I don't know.

1877
01:28:50,901 --> 01:28:54,510
What the fuck these natural or unnatural
sweeteners do for you?

1878
01:28:54,511 --> 01:28:57,090
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck they do.

1879
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:59,060
I don't know.
I don't know.

1880
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:00,570
I don't know what's dangerous and what's
not,

1881
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:02,850
but know sugar just gets you fat.
I mean,

1882
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:06,390
it might give you diabetes,
have you got a wacky system,

1883
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,640
but basically just gets you fat when you
take that.

1884
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:13,430
Aspartame is significant evidence that 
point that that stuff causes cancer,

1885
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:16,270
like brain cancer or.
I do.

1886
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,180
I eat a lot of that shit.
Yeah.

1887
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:20,490
I don't think you should take a lot of 
aspartame.

1888
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Linda's six splendid Trenta iced coffee.
I think the only shit that they've shown

1889
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:32,990
that's really safe is Stevia.
Stevia is eventual even taste that good.

1890
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:39,190
No.
Even lately there has been some shit on 

1891
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:39,190
Stevia or he'll.
Yeah.

1892
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:39,190
Oh,
I haven't heard that because Stevia is a

1893
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:40,650
plant.
What's that stuff?

1894
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:42,430
This syrup a Gavi.
It's pretty good.

1895
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:45,060
That's what I have is actually not good 
for you.

1896
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:51,250
It is so disappointing.
The Gavi is high in like a sugary syrup.

1897
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,270
I had no idea.
I thought it was fine.

1898
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:56,610
It's not like honey,
honey is actually good for you.

1899
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:58,410
A Gaba is not good for it.
It's just sugar.

1900
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:00,570
What a mess,
but it's not bad for you.

1901
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:05,070
I mean,
it's like the real problem with sugar is

1902
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:08,190
if you get it without all the other shit
that it's attached to,

1903
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:13,220
like if you get sugar from fruit,
it's not nearly as bad for you is a 

1904
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:17,061
spoonful of sugar.
You take a spoonful of sugar in your 

1905
01:30:17,061 --> 01:30:18,330
body just like jolt like that.

1906
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:22,110
You're not supposed to get that in that 
forum and when you drink a coke,

1907
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:26,360
you're drinking like several spoonfuls 
just pounded it into your bloodstream.

1908
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:29,730
I wonder how many spoonfuls of aspartame
is in a diet coke?

1909
01:30:29,731 --> 01:30:31,270
No one's done that.
I've never seen that.

1910
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:34,620
Even juices.
That's the criticism of fruit juices.

1911
01:30:34,621 --> 01:30:39,621
The criticism of fruit,
fruit juices is you're getting far too 

1912
01:30:39,621 --> 01:30:42,441
much sugar like you,
you're really supposed to do is drink 

1913
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:42,441
water and eat oranges.
Like.

1914
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:43,920
Because when you eat,
an orange is attached to fiber,

1915
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:46,800
it's attached to cellulose.
All the different plant,

1916
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:49,590
whatever the fuck the orange to the 
fruit is made of.

1917
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,420
It's like you're just supposed to get 
that.

1918
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:52,070
That's,
that's the,

1919
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:57,130
that's the nutritional package.
It's supposed to get fiber along with 

1920
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:57,130
it.
You know?

1921
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:00,570
It's like one of the reasons why Kale 
shakes are show so good as opposed to 

1922
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:00,570
juicing.

1923
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:04,340
Like this guy,
the whole foods was talking to me about 

1924
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:04,340
that.
Like,

1925
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:04,340
do you juice?
I said,

1926
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:04,590
I like juicing too.
I like juicing.

1927
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:08,340
Juicing is great for getting a lot of 
chlorophyll,

1928
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:13,470
a lot of like you can get like highly 
concentrated like Greens if you juice,

1929
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:17,160
but the fibers really good for you too 
and when,

1930
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,750
if you can just choke it down,
you know,

1931
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,340
and not a lot of people are like,
oh my God,

1932
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:21,900
what are you eating?
Just choke it down.

1933
01:31:21,930 --> 01:31:24,020
You mean your Kale shakes?
Yeah,

1934
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,420
those are disgusting.
I got to go ahead,

1935
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,880
go piss you say they're nasty,
but they're so good for you man.

1936
01:31:29,881 --> 01:31:34,881
And I can't tell you how many people 
that I've run into at these shows that 

1937
01:31:34,881 --> 01:31:38,631
like,
this one dude didn't in Anaheim this 

1938
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:38,910
weekend.
He said that he lost 200 fucking pounds.

1939
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:43,200
He showed me a picture of him standing 
next to Dan Henderson and he was like,

1940
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,400
or is it Ben Henderson?

1941
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:46,560
Hm?
Not sure.

1942
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,390
Blurry picture.
Um,

1943
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:53,391
I forgot to ask him,
but he was enormous and now he's like 

1944
01:31:53,391 --> 01:31:53,391
200 pounds.
I was like,

1945
01:31:53,391 --> 01:31:54,150
that is insane.
I go,

1946
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:55,530
I go,
that's incredible.

1947
01:31:55,531 --> 01:31:56,010
He goes,
dude,

1948
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:58,020
it was just listening to the podcast.
He goes,

1949
01:31:58,021 --> 01:31:59,010
you guys changed my life.
He,

1950
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:03,580
I started thinking about things positive
and realizing what can I do to affect my

1951
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:08,581
quality of life.
So I started drinking Kale shakes every 

1952
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:11,760
day.
I started working out just a little 

1953
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:11,760
going on,
walked 200 fucking pounds.

1954
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,510
This guy lost.
It's crazy.

1955
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:15,010
Let me check this out.
Oh yeah,

1956
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:16,180
yeah.
This is.

1957
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:18,040
And by the way,
that 200 pound things,

1958
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:20,710
that's just one of them.
I ran into some folks in North Carolina.

1959
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:22,000
They had lost over 100.
One Guy,

1960
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,400
the guy lost 100,
the girl last 90.

1961
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:27,670
I mean we run into it all the time.
It's nuts.

1962
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:33,660
It's unexpected with this is what we're 
about to play is Quintin Tarantino,

1963
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:35,700
who is one,
talked about this before,

1964
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:40,660
but this is an unconnected.
This video is Quinn Tarantino,

1965
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,430
my favorite director of all time.
If you,

1966
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:45,730
if you tell me like if there's a new 
Quintin Tarantino movie,

1967
01:32:45,731 --> 01:32:47,650
I know I'm going to have a good time.
You guys are nuts,

1968
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:51,000
but I'm like a lot of nuts.
He's,

1969
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:56,110
he's nuts and he's a,
he's a brilliant director but he's a 

1970
01:32:56,741 --> 01:33:00,430
chameleon socially.
And I noticed it when I was listening to

1971
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:05,431
him on.
I had the Sirius Xm in my other car and 

1972
01:33:05,431 --> 01:33:07,180
my last car and uh,
listened to him.

1973
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:12,100
He was on stern and he sounded almost a 
feminine,

1974
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,610
like almost gay or very,
I should say,

1975
01:33:15,611 --> 01:33:16,870
very submissive.
Maybe.

1976
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:18,670
I don't know.
What we're looking for is autistic.

1977
01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:19,990
Maybe it's that.
Yeah,

1978
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:22,870
he might be that or maybe he's got like,
um,

1979
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,600
maybe he's asperger's or something like 
that.

1980
01:33:26,410 --> 01:33:27,940
But.
So then he goes on,

1981
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:32,941
opie and Anthony.
And then when he was on Opie and 

1982
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:32,941
Anthony,
he was one of the guys who like,

1983
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,240
you know,
open anthony or like regular guys,

1984
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:39,241
you know.
So you go on that show and Jimmy Norton 

1985
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:39,241
stared talking about trannies and you're
like,

1986
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:39,241
I'm one of the guys were,
one of the guys were hanging out here.

1987
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:39,850
Guys.
We're hanging out,

1988
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:40,750
guys,
guys are hanging out.

1989
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:46,140
Then he goes on the Jamie Foxx show and 
he's black and it's not really like 

1990
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:50,340
sounds black and sounds like an old 
white guy trying to talk and he's 

1991
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:51,070
talking black to,
you know,

1992
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:56,550
listen,
you want to talk about black dudes who 

1993
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:58,090
are bad motherfuckers.
Okay.

1994
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:03,310
Then there's obviously in pop culture or
in athletics and you know,

1995
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:08,410
there's been many,
many African Americans that have pulled 

1996
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,200
off some staggering shit.
Jamie Foxx is a mother fucker.

1997
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:11,740
Okay.

1998
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,250
Jamie Foxx,
one didn't even like her grammy.

1999
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,890
He could sing.
It's fucking Dick off.

2000
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:18,820
Okay.
You hear him sing when he did,

2001
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:22,270
when he played Ray Charles.
That motherfucker is talented.

2002
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,330
That guy can play.
He can play piano.

2003
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,520
He seems like a fucking,
like,

2004
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:32,320
like as good as a professional.
Famous singer could sing.

2005
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:37,410
I mean the dude's ultra super talented.
He also has his own radio station.

2006
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:40,290
Okay.
He's got the foxhole.

2007
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:40,910
It's like.
Yeah,

2008
01:34:40,911 --> 01:34:42,200
it was Jamie Foxx.
He asked me.

2009
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,440
He has.
Well it's your name is.

2010
01:34:44,630 --> 01:34:47,380
Why don't I call it the foxhole?
It's his place there hanging out.

2011
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:52,381
Right?
So quintin Tarantino in the face of 

2012
01:34:52,381 --> 01:34:54,340
hanging around with this,
you know,

2013
01:34:55,300 --> 01:34:56,110
Uber,
man,

2014
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,400
you know this,
who accomplished so much.

2015
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:03,401
This is a freak success story in the 
history of the African American race 

2016
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:07,130
that he liked morphs into a black guy 
when he's talking to them.

2017
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,990
Let's see this shit and it's really 
awkward.

2018
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:10,820
Well then that was,
that was on the radio,

2019
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:15,850
but this is something that I saw on the 
Internet the other day where other 

2020
01:35:15,850 --> 01:35:19,340
people are starting to pick up on this 
and this welcome

2021
01:35:19,490 --> 01:35:24,490
writer,
director and Academy Award winner 

2022
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:27,130
acquaintance.
He knows all these black fellas and 

2023
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:31,170
ladies hanging out on this cool set for 
the Django and they're asking them 

2024
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:35,461
questions here.
Has to be like one of the most quoted 

2025
01:35:35,461 --> 01:35:35,620
movies in Hollywood with just the lines 
and everything.

2026
01:35:35,621 --> 01:35:37,930
So you got to give us this.
One of my questions for you is,

2027
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:43,510
what is the most famous like Yo,
your favorite line from pulp fiction?

2028
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:46,270
Uh,
I think probably the most famous line is

2029
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,110
I'm going to get married but on your 
ass.

2030
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,840
Okay.
That's not too bad because he's like 

2031
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:54,840
warming up for the

2032
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:58,000
oppression.
But pleasing your fans or pleasing the 

2033
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:58,060
critics for you?

2034
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,190
That's an interesting question actually.
Um,

2035
01:36:00,230 --> 01:36:02,420
um.
Well,

2036
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,150
I want to.
I want to please my fans.

2037
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:07,680
I don't want to police to critics that 
I'm a fans.

2038
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:10,010
The critics and fans,
I don't give a damn.

2039
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:15,180
He rapped.
He is wrapped into an impromptu rap.

2040
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,560
That was one of the most uncomfortable 
things.

2041
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,200
He's a visionary director.
Division of that girl wants to work for 

2042
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:25,200
him.
Ooh,

2043
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:25,200
she's hot too.
I wonder if she would fuck them.

2044
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:30,850
I'm not that computer savvy.
So Athena sent me something that I 

2045
01:36:30,850 --> 01:36:35,081
plugged into my computer.
I don't know if I would ever heard it 

2046
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:35,081
hit download this.
I don't know how to do that.

2047
01:36:35,170 --> 01:36:40,170
Alright then Jamie.
My man.

2048
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:41,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2049
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,830
Jamie Foxx.
Fox sitting here going,

2050
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:47,540
man.
Motherfucker.

2051
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,340
Rick Ross and the whole plastic.
By the way,

2052
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:56,360
that's the same as Jackson.
Jackson is very uncomfortable.

2053
01:36:57,860 --> 01:37:02,860
Look at him.
He's not even taking that fucking 

2054
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:02,860
microphone away from his Dick.
Like.

2055
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:07,120
So I can lady and said,
I need 100 black preachers with a black 

2056
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,590
sir.
Go over to carry with my little tape.

2057
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:14,591
We're going to plant.
Isn't it possible though?

2058
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:19,690
This is some kind of weird conceptual 
gag he's doing like he was backstage.

2059
01:37:19,691 --> 01:37:21,770
I like,
I'm just going to do this for no reason.

2060
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:24,980
It's isn't it possible at some inside 
joke I made,

2061
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,530
it does remind me of something that my 
ex girlfriend,

2062
01:37:27,531 --> 01:37:32,531
the dude just because she likes like 
kind of like trolling every single 

2063
01:37:32,531 --> 01:37:32,531
person she talks.
Yeah,

2064
01:37:32,531 --> 01:37:32,560
yeah,
yeah.

2065
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:37,570
I got it man.
With someone like Quentin Tarantino who 

2066
01:37:37,570 --> 01:37:39,380
is clearly a fucking genius.
I've got to think first.

2067
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:44,440
This is some kind of gag.
That's what I think that that guy is so 

2068
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:44,440
cool,
man.

2069
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,430
Just because you looking for a 
conspiracy and everything.

2070
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:48,590
I don't know.
Maybe that's just me.

2071
01:37:48,591 --> 01:37:49,100
I go,
oh,

2072
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:50,840
he's a loon.
I think it's brilliant.

2073
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,190
I think has aspergers,
man.

2074
01:37:52,191 --> 01:37:55,680
I think he just gets uncomfortable or 
nervous and he doesn't even realize he's

2075
01:37:55,681 --> 01:37:56,040
doing

2076
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,430
it,
but I bet you're right of,

2077
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,370
look,
we're making fun of the guy.

2078
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:01,110
Okay.
It has to be done.

2079
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:03,600
Doesn't mean I don't love him.
He goes to fucking awesome.

2080
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:06,420
Thanks Jane.
I had an amazing director,

2081
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:11,421
but that Shit's hilarious.
It's hilarious when you're a different 

2082
01:38:11,421 --> 01:38:11,421
person in three different places,
but you might be right.

2083
01:38:11,421 --> 01:38:13,520
It might be that it's gotta be a gag.
Yeah,

2084
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,650
let's check this and I'll get took it 
home and I played on going.

2085
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,040
This is the bomb

2086
01:38:22,210 --> 01:38:24,030
before.
My movies are always filled with song,

2087
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:29,031
but it's always stuff that I chose for 
me than my own collection or something 

2088
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:32,101
like that.
I never had like a music supervisor 

2089
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:32,101
hooked me up with stuff.
It's always stuff.

2090
01:38:32,101 --> 01:38:32,220
I chose a of the reason.
I know.

2091
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:37,230
Watch this.
I just want to show him to write 

2092
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:37,870
something and then they do red nose 
reindeer.

2093
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:41,560
A Charlie Brown special.
What was that one with Fred Astaire?

2094
01:38:41,561 --> 01:38:46,561
Is the mailman a started.
He's narrating a Santa Claus is coming 

2095
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:46,561
to town.

2096
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,410
Yeah.
At the end they're like,

2097
01:38:50,411 --> 01:38:52,060
what is,
who are you?

2098
01:38:52,270 --> 01:38:55,000
I was trying to find that he has speech 
he did at the Oscars.

2099
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:57,620
That was a really good one because he 
was in front of like a,

2100
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:02,660
you know,
like the highest of Hollywood people 

2101
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:02,730
who's being very respectful.
So his voice is.

2102
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:04,780
And how he talked,
it was very accurate.

2103
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:06,880
Like it was way better example than 
that.

2104
01:39:06,881 --> 01:39:09,430
What we just saw there.
It was super white guy.

2105
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:14,520
What a strange fellow man that is using.
Man.

2106
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:15,670
He's awesome.
I love him.

2107
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:18,070
I love him to love him.
He makes the best movies,

2108
01:39:18,071 --> 01:39:19,630
man.
His movies are fun.

2109
01:39:19,631 --> 01:39:22,120
They're all fun.
They're all wild chaos also.

2110
01:39:22,121 --> 01:39:27,121
You know about the theater he bar right?
They either theater in La that only 

2111
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:27,660
shows it.
It's in.

2112
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:32,670
It's not in Santa Monica.
I can't remember the name of the 

2113
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:32,670
theater.

2114
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,600
The theater he bought like a theater 
with it shows like only film.

2115
01:39:34,690 --> 01:39:36,970
Yeah,
it only shows shit that was shy.

2116
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It doesn't show anything digital.
So like you go there and they show all 

2117
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,911
these old grind films and stuff and like
it's just bad as in like it's not a 

2118
01:39:44,911 --> 01:39:49,741
profitable place.
He just does it because he doesn't want 

2119
01:39:49,741 --> 01:39:50,770
digital to takeover which it is,
which is going to happen.

2120
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:53,090
What's going to happen anyway,
but it's still cool though,

2121
01:39:53,091 --> 01:39:54,480
just to have it like that silent 
theater.

2122
01:39:54,481 --> 01:39:55,550
Is that still open?
Yeah,

2123
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,230
it's open.
Yeah.

2124
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:58,950
That's pretty dope.
There's a silent theater in la where you

2125
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,850
can go watch a silent movie.
Yeah.

2126
01:40:00,851 --> 01:40:05,230
That's where Doug Benson does all his 
movies where he watches a movie and then

2127
01:40:05,231 --> 01:40:10,231
talks while the movie's going on.
He watches at the Senate families at the

2128
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:12,280
theater.
It's called Santa Fe.

2129
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:12,720
Yeah.

2130
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:15,940
So He.
He watches a silent movie and then talks

2131
01:40:15,941 --> 01:40:16,450
over it.
No,

2132
01:40:16,451 --> 01:40:17,140
it's not.
It's not in the mood.

2133
01:40:17,141 --> 01:40:20,980
Just a regular movie like top gun and 
then they just sit there and pretty much

2134
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:21,790
common,
you know,

2135
01:40:21,791 --> 01:40:25,570
that was an also an issue.
A quintin Tarantino issue is Roger Avery

2136
01:40:25,571 --> 01:40:29,620
apparently was the guy who wrote that 
whole top gun gay connection thing.

2137
01:40:29,621 --> 01:40:33,250
That was like Roger Avery's baby.
And quintin Tarantino did it in a movie.

2138
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:39,010
Yeah.
He was in a movie and he like 

2139
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:40,930
chameleons.
Roger Avery and told the whole top gun 

2140
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:44,101
story.
It being sort of a gay love story and 

2141
01:40:44,101 --> 01:40:44,530
when it really represents,
it's really brilliant,

2142
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,930
you know?
Have you ever seen him pull,

2143
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:51,060
pull it up?
Quintin Tarantino explains top gun 

2144
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:52,780
because it's a.
it's kind of a trip that Roger Avery was

2145
01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:53,980
a really

2146
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,720
brilliant guy.
He wrote killing Zoe,

2147
01:40:55,990 --> 01:41:00,990
did you ever see killing fucking 
fantastic crime movie?

2148
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:04,180
It's a fucking great movie and it's 
very,

2149
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:09,930
I don't want to say pulp fiction like,
but exciting in that same way like pulp 

2150
01:41:09,930 --> 01:41:14,491
fiction is.
I don't want to tell you anymore about 

2151
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:16,291
it,
but it's killing is always one of my 

2152
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:16,291
favorite movies.
So fucking bad ass.

2153
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,970
It's like,
it's just really well done.

2154
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,220
And then my cat,
after that I had a cat named Zoey.

2155
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:26,440
Um,
so Roger Avery who created that and also

2156
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:31,530
cowrote pulp fiction with Tarantino and 
you can see like when you see like a 

2157
01:41:31,630 --> 01:41:33,950
killing zoe.
And when you read some of his,

2158
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,360
he was the one who got in trouble for 
tweeting when he was in jail.

2159
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:38,680
Remember that?
Nope.

2160
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:41,740
Roger Avery was in jail.
I think he drunk drive.

2161
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:43,580
He was uh,
he was uh,

2162
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:48,640
he,
he was driving truck and he killed 

2163
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:48,640
somebody.

2164
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,360
I think he got in a car accident.
Killed one of his friends.

2165
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:52,150
Oh yeah.
And he had to go to jail for a while and

2166
01:41:52,151 --> 01:41:55,120
he was tweeting from jail and there was 
like some sort of a,

2167
01:41:55,121 --> 01:42:00,121
um,
a controversy with the fact that he was 

2168
01:42:00,121 --> 01:42:00,121
able to tweet from jail.
So they moved here.

2169
01:42:00,121 --> 01:42:01,840
They want them moving.
And I think because of it,

2170
01:42:01,841 --> 01:42:04,090
I think it like he really got fucked 
over because of it.

2171
01:42:04,091 --> 01:42:09,091
I think.
I'm not sure if I'm telling them the 

2172
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:09,091
exact true story,
but he,

2173
01:42:09,091 --> 01:42:13,681
um,
wrote these really interesting tweets 

2174
01:42:13,681 --> 01:42:13,990
from jails.
Really fascinating.

2175
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:19,040
Let's talk about the different social 
things that are going on and this guy 

2176
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,770
across the hall.
So the guy owes him money.

2177
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,870
This could get ugly.
You know,

2178
01:42:22,430 --> 01:42:24,010
it's really fascinating shit.
You know,

2179
01:42:24,011 --> 01:42:25,270
that he would talk about,
you know,

2180
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,620
God is getting bribed and dudes 
smuggling heroin up they ass.

2181
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:34,510
This is

2182
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,230
what's it really about?
What's your,

2183
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,100
what's like it?
It's like a stick.

2184
01:42:39,110 --> 01:42:41,530
This is fine.
This one sentence like,

2185
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:43,440
boy meets girl,
I don't give a shit about them.

2186
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:44,900
Fuck boy meets girl.
Fuck motorcycle.

2187
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:49,910
You know what is really being said?
Which really basically that's what you 

2188
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:53,481
were trying to about because the whole 
idea man is the version you want some 

2189
01:42:53,481 --> 01:42:57,210
version on a massive level.
You don't want the greatest fucking 

2190
01:42:57,210 --> 01:42:59,290
scripts ever written in the history of 
Hollywood is top gun.

2191
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,400
Top Gun is fucking great.
What is top gun?

2192
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,380
You think it's a story about a bunch of 
fighter pilots.

2193
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,760
It's a bunch of guys waving fixer.
It is a story about a man who struggled 

2194
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:13,770
with his own homosexual.
That's it.

2195
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,600
That is what top gun is about,
man.

2196
01:43:15,980 --> 01:43:17,550
You've got maverick,
right?

2197
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:18,910
He's on the edge,
man.

2198
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:21,090
He's right on the line.
All right.

2199
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:24,110
And you got ice man and all his crew.
They're gay.

2200
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:26,380
And they are.
They represent the gay man.

2201
01:43:26,690 --> 01:43:28,070
Alright.
And they were saying go,

2202
01:43:28,350 --> 01:43:29,170
go.
The gateway.

2203
01:43:29,220 --> 01:43:30,520
Go to the game where he could go both 
ways.

2204
01:43:31,100 --> 01:43:32,110
I'm going to go.
She's,

2205
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,400
she's,
she's heterosexuality.

2206
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:34,190
She's saying,
no,

2207
01:43:34,191 --> 01:43:34,390
no,
no,

2208
01:43:34,391 --> 01:43:34,780
no,
no.

2209
01:43:34,930 --> 01:43:36,640
Go the normal way.
Play by the rules.

2210
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,290
Go the normal way.
They're saying no.

2211
01:43:38,430 --> 01:43:39,820
Go with the gateway.
The gateway,

2212
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:45,180
the gateway.
That is what's going on throughout that 

2213
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:45,180
whole movie.
He goes to her house,

2214
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:46,210
right?
It looks like they're going to have sex,

2215
01:43:46,211 --> 01:43:47,230
you know,
they're just kinda sitting back.

2216
01:43:47,231 --> 01:43:52,231
He's taking a shower and everything.
They don't have sex and he gets in the 

2217
01:43:52,231 --> 01:43:52,231
motorcycle,
drives away.

2218
01:43:52,231 --> 01:43:52,231
She's like,
the fuck.

2219
01:43:52,231 --> 01:43:53,780
What the fuck is going on?
Next scene.

2220
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,280
Next scene.
You see her,

2221
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,920
she's in the elevator.
She gets dressed like a guy.

2222
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:00,830
She's got the cap on the theater 
classes.

2223
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:03,550
Do you want in the same jacket that the 
iceman where's?

2224
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:04,430
She goes,
okay,

2225
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,800
let's get this guy.
This guy's going towards the gateway,

2226
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,920
so I got to bring him back.
I got to bring him back from the 

2227
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,291
gateway,
so I'm going to do that because I'm 

2228
01:44:14,291 --> 01:44:15,260
going to dress like a man.
That is how she approaches it.

2229
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:15,740
Right?
Okay.

2230
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,120
All right.
But the real.

2231
01:44:17,121 --> 01:44:19,950
And they get the movies mix at the end 
already gets it.

2232
01:44:19,951 --> 01:44:24,951
He has passed over into the gateway.
They are fighting for beating the 

2233
01:44:26,691 --> 01:44:27,380
Russians.
All right.

2234
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,660
And it's over.
And they fucking land and iceman.

2235
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:33,470
Maverick the entire time.
Finally he's got it.

2236
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,670
All right.
And what is the last fucking line?

2237
01:44:35,671 --> 01:44:40,671
Did they together all hugging and 
kissing and happy with each other and 

2238
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:41,390
ice comes up the maverick and he says,
man,

2239
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:46,840
you can ride.
You can ride.

2240
01:44:56,010 --> 01:44:56,770
That's so great.
Yeah,

2241
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:02,280
that's brilliant.
You are Roger Avery and you wrote that 

2242
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:06,640
Quentin Tarantino movie that would suck 
a Dick that tax and apparently quintin 

2243
01:45:07,371 --> 01:45:10,080
claims that co wrote it together.
I don't know.

2244
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:13,140
I don't know what happened,
but that's a fucking brilliant analysis.

2245
01:45:13,141 --> 01:45:14,700
Whoever wrote it.
Quintin or Roger?

2246
01:45:14,701 --> 01:45:15,900
Every.
Whoever wrote.

2247
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:18,060
That's a brilliant.
What's that from?

2248
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:20,700
That's from killings,
let.

2249
01:45:20,701 --> 01:45:21,360
No,
no,

2250
01:45:21,361 --> 01:45:21,780
no,
no,

2251
01:45:21,781 --> 01:45:23,130
no.
I don't know what that movie.

2252
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:23,750
That's A.

2253
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,020
I don't know what the movie was.

2254
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,560
That's not killing.
Is that what you know now?

2255
01:45:29,561 --> 01:45:32,570
It's from something much more recent.
No,

2256
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:34,940
that's not recent.
That's actually really.

2257
01:45:35,020 --> 01:45:37,410
I think I had much more killings.
Oh really?

2258
01:45:37,411 --> 01:45:38,610
Yeah,
I've seen that before.

2259
01:45:38,611 --> 01:45:39,810
A long time ago.
Okay.

2260
01:45:39,811 --> 01:45:41,970
Well now we need to figure that out.
Pull it up.

2261
01:45:41,971 --> 01:45:42,780
Find out what,
where,

2262
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:44,630
where it came from.
Um,

2263
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:47,490
but I think killings.
Zoe was in the nineties,

2264
01:45:47,491 --> 01:45:48,960
wasn't it?
I don't know.

2265
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:51,000
That was.
Yeah.

2266
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,380
I was like,
great fucking movie.

2267
01:45:52,381 --> 01:45:52,680
Man.

2268
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:57,970
I love that.
That's what making movies is about as 

2269
01:45:57,970 --> 01:45:58,700
sleep with that 1994 with me.
Yeah.

2270
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:03,060
So I saw that long ass time ago because 
I was addicted to Quintin Tarantino said

2271
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:06,690
to see every single movie that Quintin 
Tarantino isn't job.

2272
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:10,170
Have you seen this Microsoft thing that 
they announced a four.

2273
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:15,420
It's supposedly for upcoming xbox and 
what it does is it takes a picture of 

2274
01:46:15,420 --> 01:46:17,750
your room.
So like say like your tvs on the wall.

2275
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:22,870
It takes a picture of everything around 
your room and adds it to the game and 

2276
01:46:22,870 --> 01:46:23,990
it's fucking trippy.
Check this out.

2277
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:26,010
Oh.

2278
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:28,600
So imagine like a video game in the 
future

2279
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:39,720
scanning room and saying shit on the 
wall.

2280
01:46:45,610 --> 01:46:46,300
But Watch,
watch,

2281
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,110
watch this book show.
Pretty soon it,

2282
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,870
it knows the bookshelves there

2283
01:46:50,690 --> 01:46:55,690
and so it looks distracting as it looks 
better when you see it in hd,

2284
01:46:57,150 --> 01:46:59,730
the low raza,
the thing makes it look like shit.

2285
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:01,380
Oh really?
What we're looking at.

2286
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,300
Oh Wow.
It does the,

2287
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:09,180
like it really manipulates your 
environment.

2288
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:12,840
So it adds it to the game.
Like oh wow.

2289
01:47:12,841 --> 01:47:16,810
So it highlights the bookshelf and the.
Yeah.

2290
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:20,100
And so like,
like it showed like it should have

2291
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:22,080
pixels,
pixels were coming at you,

2292
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:27,081
but it knew the floor was there so the 
pixels would kind of ride the floor and 

2293
01:47:27,081 --> 01:47:28,110
stuff like that.
It's cool man.

2294
01:47:28,140 --> 01:47:31,050
That well it seems like that's where 
it's all going to go right now.

2295
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:33,360
It's going to the fucking oculus rift 
dude.

2296
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:35,380
That's where it's going.
Fuck the projectors.

2297
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:36,990
Shit.
Have you seen the OCULUS rift?

2298
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,170
What does that have you seen videos of 
people with the OCULUS rift off?

2299
01:47:40,220 --> 01:47:45,220
It's,
it's this like consumer based virtual 

2300
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:47,781
reality helmet that's coming out that is
apparently so insane that when people 

2301
01:47:47,781 --> 01:47:51,060
wear it and they hear someone talking 
near them while the rift is on,

2302
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,300
it's confusing.
It'd be like you sitting here right now 

2303
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:58,431
and suddenly a disembodied voice starts 
talking to you because it like fully 

2304
01:47:58,431 --> 01:47:59,550
like.
It's like apparently incredible.

2305
01:47:59,551 --> 01:48:04,551
There's videos of it out there.
If you've seen those red band got to 

2306
01:48:04,551 --> 01:48:07,880
show people putting it on the lenses 
credit.

2307
01:48:07,930 --> 01:48:12,930
Fisheye effect I got to do is give you 
the headset.

2308
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:19,370
Yeah,
he's going to where you're standing.

2309
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:24,371
You would have your body,
your brain just naturally just telling 

2310
01:48:24,371 --> 01:48:26,330
you to start walking,
you know,

2311
01:48:26,331 --> 01:48:30,890
it'd be a really good way to put this on
someone's head and they're like,

2312
01:48:30,891 --> 01:48:33,920
inside of like a train tunnel and have 
them walk towards the light,

2313
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:35,000
come out into the world

2314
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,720
right when he puts it on,

2315
01:48:39,890 --> 01:48:42,130
walk up to like one of these buildings 
basically.

2316
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:45,100
And we can't see what he's saying 
though.

2317
01:48:45,101 --> 01:48:46,510
We just see a guy with some crazy

2318
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,980
good to see for yourself.
That candidate Anthony.

2319
01:48:56,090 --> 01:49:01,090
Okay.
So he's going to put it off for the 

2320
01:49:01,090 --> 01:49:01,090
first time.
Taking the red or the blue pill.

2321
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,800
Just adjust a little bit.
Someone that's pretty good.

2322
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:11,850
Looks pretty good to me.
So before you take off running through 

2323
01:49:11,850 --> 01:49:12,400
the streets of this village,
you know,

2324
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:16,030
I want you to look left,
look right,

2325
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:21,500
look up,
look down shit,

2326
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,960
and actually look at 180 degrees of turn
your body and look at me.

2327
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:29,700
Basically Ryan would be phenomenal.
So you do have all three 60 head track.

2328
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:33,540
Wow.
So first just take a look at some of the

2329
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:35,140
snow.
The snow is,

2330
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:40,240
it's all stared at.
So you should see some nice depth to 

2331
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:40,240
that snow.
You feel like it's falling on,

2332
01:49:40,500 --> 01:49:41,500
you're going to kitchen.

2333
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:46,800
Wow.
So they finally figured it out.

2334
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:48,340
Well they,
yeah,

2335
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:53,341
they've had it for awhile.
They just haven't been consumer based 

2336
01:49:53,341 --> 01:49:55,801
when you know and they've got to like 
the other interesting thing and one of 

2337
01:49:55,801 --> 01:49:58,561
the other interviews I saw as they're 
talking about when there are wasting it 

2338
01:49:58,561 --> 01:50:01,951
and they say obviously they can't 
release it until people designed games 

2339
01:50:01,951 --> 01:50:04,681
for it and that it's not as simple as 
just plugging it into a game because the

2340
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,200
size ratios are off in a game and like 
the characters running around in the 

2341
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:11,740
game are either bigger than a human 
would be,

2342
01:50:11,741 --> 01:50:13,660
are generally smaller than a human would
be.

2343
01:50:13,661 --> 01:50:18,661
So for it to really work,
you've got to design a thing around an 

2344
01:50:18,661 --> 01:50:20,080
actual human size.
So it's really,

2345
01:50:20,081 --> 01:50:25,081
it's a really strange.
They've got to go through and redesign 

2346
01:50:25,081 --> 01:50:25,300
games based on this fucking thing.

2347
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:28,640
Nobody works harder and longer hours 
than game designers.

2348
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:33,190
God Damn drives work some crazy hours.
Do you remember when we were hanging out

2349
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:38,191
with cliff,
he beat and it was getting close to the 

2350
01:50:38,191 --> 01:50:40,680
release,
one of their games and they said they 

2351
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,241
would just sleep in the office,
that we just sleep in the office and 

2352
01:50:42,241 --> 01:50:45,481
worked for weeks at a time and like 
loved ones would come and visit them at 

2353
01:50:45,481 --> 01:50:45,481
work.
They would just be gone.

2354
01:50:45,481 --> 01:50:49,360
You've worked forever and just to to to 
meet a deadline to get a game out.

2355
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:54,610
Yeah.
It's a crazy world of video game 

2356
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,971
development.
That's a lot of hours and that's a 

2357
01:50:56,971 --> 01:50:56,971
difficult

2358
01:50:56,971 --> 01:51:00,380
and so weird that like that,
that those guys don't have like an 

2359
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:01,450
Oscars that's going to be in the future.
Like now we get these guys.

2360
01:51:01,451 --> 01:51:04,360
You like regurgitate wind,
somebody wrote and we're like,

2361
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:09,361
oh great.
What about these people who are God's 

2362
01:51:09,361 --> 01:51:10,410
creating virtual universities that you 
can run around inside of?

2363
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:11,590
Yeah.
That's no joke.

2364
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,520
That's no with code,
with code,

2365
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:15,760
with fucking code.
They're not even.

2366
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:20,620
They have to type lines of code to that 
invoke virtual reality.

2367
01:51:20,621 --> 01:51:24,310
There's so many alternate dimensions 
with code.

2368
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:25,780
Yeah.
It's insane,

2369
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:31,020
and then you're going to be able to pop 
on and fucking oculus rift and suddenly 

2370
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:34,411
be existing inside of world of warcraft.
I call that my last day on earth.

2371
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:38,290
That's going to be that in the hamster 
wheel.

2372
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:44,920
That's the one fucking problem and 
that's going to be the final thing is 

2373
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:44,920
that

2374
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:45,920
I think they'll just create a warehouse.
You know,

2375
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:51,080
they'll just.
All you need is a gigantic warehouse 

2376
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,811
space,
so you have a warehouse space and you 

2377
01:51:53,811 --> 01:51:54,090
designed the virtual reality game for 
whatever the space is like.

2378
01:51:54,091 --> 01:51:58,350
Say It's a airplane hangar,
giant fucking Costco sized building with

2379
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,820
no,
no trees,

2380
01:51:59,821 --> 01:52:04,821
no nothing.
Where aware we're pole is replace it 

2381
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:07,581
with a tree and boom,
you're off to the races and so you stay 

2382
01:52:07,581 --> 01:52:10,971
inside this building and you live in a 
reality totally created for this 

2383
01:52:10,971 --> 01:52:10,971
building.

2384
01:52:10,971 --> 01:52:15,540
Or are you just plug some shit into the 
back of your brain stem that makes you 

2385
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,790
feel like you're moving and gradually 
just transformed a big fat wow.

2386
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:20,340
Yeah,
and the other problem was if you had a a

2387
01:52:20,341 --> 01:52:25,341
warehouse,
the real problem would be the only 

2388
01:52:25,341 --> 01:52:27,981
things that you would come in contact 
with or things that are touching the 

2389
01:52:27,981 --> 01:52:31,971
floor couldn't really come in contact 
with anything physical and the virtual 

2390
01:52:31,971 --> 01:52:36,351
reality sense,
unless you're dealing with some sort of 

2391
01:52:36,351 --> 01:52:37,320
recreated neural impulse.
Right?

2392
01:52:37,321 --> 01:52:40,320
Like a,
a fake touch of fake.

2393
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,160
Yeah.

2394
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,630
It's got to be a fake.
I mean you can't,

2395
01:52:42,631 --> 01:52:47,631
you either.
You would either have to have someone 

2396
01:52:47,631 --> 01:52:49,431
in.
There is a ball of virtual reality ball 

2397
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:49,431
thing.
You can roll in.

2398
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:52,661
I've seen it,
but you either have to have something 

2399
01:52:52,661 --> 01:52:54,671
like that or you would have to simulate.
Well you'd have to have your brain 

2400
01:52:54,671 --> 01:52:54,671
movement.

2401
01:52:54,671 --> 01:52:56,610
Your body convinced this actually 
touching the tree.

2402
01:52:56,611 --> 01:52:58,410
So it feels a tree.
Yeah.

2403
01:52:58,411 --> 01:53:03,411
Maybe if it was so convincing that you 
or your fingers responded to it.

2404
01:53:05,010 --> 01:53:06,050
Yeah,
he gloved.

2405
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:11,100
It doesn't make sense though because 
would be some went to touch a tree and 

2406
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:11,100
it wasn't there.
Your fingers would just go right through

2407
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:11,700
it.
Like you would have to.

2408
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:12,780
It would have to stop it.

2409
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:16,500
It have to be a magnetic field that 
conform to some kind of shape.

2410
01:53:16,501 --> 01:53:21,501
It would have to be some way that 
something you're wearing responds to a 

2411
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:24,600
magnetic field and it creates the sense 
of a shape being there.

2412
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:26,760
You know,
something like that.

2413
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:29,310
Horns can be amazing.
Be Amazing.

2414
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:31,200
Yeah.
It's going to be just insane.

2415
01:53:31,201 --> 01:53:33,030
Fucking Asian together.
Be able to.

2416
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:38,060
You're going to be able to dial up a 
bunch of people just blowing you all at 

2417
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:38,060
once,
like fighting over a spelling.

2418
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:39,530
It's going to be like,
hm,

2419
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:42,030
well would I like today?
Monogamous relationship,

2420
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:44,550
Ronda Rousey's hand job

2421
01:53:44,620 --> 01:53:49,620
and it's weird to think that the one 
industry that's never going to stop 

2422
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:52,840
making money as Kleenex.
It's just always fucking exist.

2423
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:56,500
Get biodegradable man.
They just go with washable towel socks.

2424
01:53:56,530 --> 01:54:01,530
Nothing wrong with a little.
Some hemp towels to clean off your 

2425
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:03,370
loads.
Yeah,

2426
01:54:03,371 --> 01:54:04,570
there's.
There's never,

2427
01:54:04,750 --> 01:54:07,150
never going to be an end to that is 
always going to be cleaned up.

2428
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:12,560
I always got to wipe your loads.
Tantric and you absorb them all and you 

2429
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:17,670
become even stronger is not the idea of 
tantric that you like you.

2430
01:54:17,671 --> 01:54:22,671
You hold on your lows,
your body reabsorbs you orgasm like 

2431
01:54:22,671 --> 01:54:23,920
ours.
Ours internally.

2432
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,240
Does that shit work?
Have you tried it?

2433
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:30,360
I don't know if that works,
but I know that there's a woman who had 

2434
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:30,820
a disease where she constantly orgasms 
and she wanted to kill herself.

2435
01:54:31,390 --> 01:54:32,140
Yeah,
right.

2436
01:54:32,410 --> 01:54:35,140
Bragen bitch.
Far as like,

2437
01:54:35,141 --> 01:54:36,340
oh my God,
I'm coming again.

2438
01:54:36,341 --> 01:54:39,410
I want to kill him.
You seen that interview?

2439
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:41,900
Stop it.
Stop it.

2440
01:54:41,901 --> 01:54:44,900
She's putting on an act so those,
those bitches that can't come don't kill

2441
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:49,901
her.
So it's the only way she can exist in 

2442
01:54:49,901 --> 01:54:50,960
with her.
Her wealth of Orgasms,

2443
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:56,080
her wealth of coming.
She's like existing amongst the common 

2444
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:56,950
poverished women who never come and 
she's older ages.

2445
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,810
That's what women want to do.
They want to come.

2446
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,240
If you could come all day,
he would come all day.

2447
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:07,480
If you can come with the same feeling,
the same like release that you do when 

2448
01:55:09,231 --> 01:55:14,231
you haven't jerked off for like a week.
You know that when you jerk off with 

2449
01:55:14,231 --> 01:55:15,230
like bullying comes power and out.
I mean,

2450
01:55:15,231 --> 01:55:18,350
it's like there's a lot of force behind 
it and get you get some distance.

2451
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,180
If you could do that three or four times
a day,

2452
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:22,160
you would do it.
You'd be doing it constantly.

2453
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:22,910
If you have the same room.

2454
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,930
This is something I always thought is of
course,

2455
01:55:25,931 --> 01:55:26,680
yeah,
like if there's a.

2456
01:55:26,681 --> 01:55:28,640
If there was like an orgasm,
are you taking.

2457
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,660
You have a nine hour orgasm,
but this woman made me think that maybe 

2458
01:55:33,881 --> 01:55:34,780
that's not.
Wouldn't that.

2459
01:55:34,810 --> 01:55:35,690
No.
They were like,

2460
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:37,520
she was in hell.
Would it be too intense?

2461
01:55:37,570 --> 01:55:40,450
Maybe she's one of those chicks just 
complains about everything.

2462
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,430
Can you mention just,
wouldn't it be cool just to pee though?

2463
01:55:43,510 --> 01:55:43,950
Like,
like,

2464
01:55:44,050 --> 01:55:49,050
like,
like a minute long p have just come out 

2465
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:51,310
really critic crazy.
There's so much more mass to come.

2466
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:52,830
Where were you going to be storing it 
all?

2467
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,550
It watch your whole body.
Just your.

2468
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:59,860
It would be like a lava lamp tour so it 
shrinks down where were were.

2469
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,710
You were like 60 percent loads backed 
up.

2470
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:07,680
Your toilet's overflowing with lowe's 
piled onto the floor.

2471
01:56:08,310 --> 01:56:12,540
I joked around about imagine if sperm 
just ran like you shot your load out and

2472
01:56:12,541 --> 01:56:15,180
they just fucking around around the 
house just trying to find a uterus.

2473
01:56:15,580 --> 01:56:16,620
They didn't stay put.
They did.

2474
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,450
Ran like an

2475
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,930
well yeah.
I like based on the.

2476
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:22,680
Maybe somebody out there in the Internet
can help us figure this out,

2477
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:26,130
but based on the size of a individual 
sperm,

2478
01:56:26,370 --> 01:56:31,370
how big would a giant have to beat as 
shoot a load where you could see the 

2479
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:31,830
sperm swimming inside of it.

2480
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:37,230
Wow.
There's a boy that died who supposedly 

2481
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:37,300
mastered baited 42 times in a day and he
died.

2482
01:56:37,510 --> 01:56:39,130
Yeah,
that's in Brazil.

2483
01:56:39,131 --> 01:56:41,140
Right?
Who knows if that's true.

2484
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:43,360
Somebody could have just made that up.
How does it kill you?

2485
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:46,050
How does he like jerking off?
That's not what killed them.

2486
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:47,870
Killed him.
He probably didn't eat already.

2487
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:51,400
Starved to death or he fucking fell and 
hit his head because he was tired.

2488
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:53,770
The jerking,
jerking off going to kill you.

2489
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,000
I don't even understand what you're 
saying.

2490
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:58,150
Maybe you had like the abrasions caused 
you to bleed out.

2491
01:57:00,090 --> 01:57:01,150
I don't know.
I'm.

2492
01:57:01,151 --> 01:57:06,151
I'm looking for A.
I wanted to go back to that aspartame 

2493
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:06,610
thing because I'm looking at and 
aspartame and uh,

2494
01:57:06,611 --> 01:57:09,100
when you look on the Wikipedia,
um,

2495
01:57:09,190 --> 01:57:11,140
it doesn't seem like it's that 
dangerous.

2496
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,320
Well,
I mean if it was slightly dangerous,

2497
01:57:14,321 --> 01:57:16,900
I doubt would be in coke zero.
You know why?

2498
01:57:16,901 --> 01:57:21,901
Yeah.
You gotta wonder like how many fucking 

2499
01:57:21,901 --> 01:57:23,080
people are taking it?
I think it's just like the science.

2500
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,550
Tammy Faye Bakker,
late stage cancer videos.

2501
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:30,230
Is that from diet coke?
He was addicted to diet coke and there's

2502
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,950
no correlation.
No connection.

2503
01:57:32,160 --> 01:57:34,110
I mean except for the fact that she 
drank.

2504
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:39,470
She was one of those people who was 
addicted to diet coke and drink 

2505
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:39,470
boatloads of.
No,

2506
01:57:39,470 --> 01:57:40,550
I'm not saying there's a correlation 
that I.

2507
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,440
It could have been super,
super unhealthy and all sorts of ways.

2508
01:57:43,441 --> 01:57:43,860
Anyway.

2509
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:45,070
Yeah,
there's just something.

2510
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,600
It's never been proven.
It's never been proven.

2511
01:57:47,870 --> 01:57:50,090
But there is like,
there is a,

2512
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:54,140
I think there is like a,
some people do think that diet coke,

2513
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:56,870
like you just said causes cancer,
you know,

2514
01:57:56,871 --> 01:57:59,030
and she drank a fuck load.
It was like her.

2515
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:01,460
She would have like something,
some ridiculous amount,

2516
01:58:01,461 --> 01:58:06,461
like 15 a day or 20 a day.
Like more than you should ever have.

2517
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:08,360
Wow.
That's crazy.

2518
01:58:08,361 --> 01:58:09,650
Bitch.
Do you remember?

2519
01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:15,270
Rest of soul.
Do you remember when that whole Jim 

2520
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:18,280
Bakker,
Tammy Faye Bakker controversy was going 

2521
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:18,280
on?
Oh yeah.

2522
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:22,270
That was.
That was brilliant stuff in the 19 

2523
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:22,270
eighties.
That was brilliant.

2524
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:26,140
Great.
Saturday night live thing like what was 

2525
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:28,421
the thing God was going to kill him if 
he didn't get a certain donation level 

2526
01:58:28,421 --> 01:58:28,520
or something.
Is that what his thing was?

2527
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:29,360
Well,
he his this

2528
01:58:29,390 --> 01:58:30,840
thing.
I don't know.

2529
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:32,380
I don't know what happened there,
but it all.

2530
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:34,300
It was basically just an affair.
Right.

2531
01:58:34,990 --> 01:58:38,830
So Fair with Jessica Hahn.
I Dunno why it became so popular.

2532
01:58:38,831 --> 01:58:42,100
Why did it become so popular?
That was new in the day like nobody

2533
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,370
was having an affair.
I like that.

2534
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:45,240
Yeah.
I guess that's what it was.

2535
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:48,110
It's funny you look at it now.
It's so time,

2536
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:50,130
right?
What affairs and well,

2537
01:58:50,131 --> 01:58:52,230
in a fair by a preacher with a 
secretary,

2538
01:58:52,231 --> 01:58:54,900
it would never be something that we 
would talk about 30 years from now.

2539
01:58:54,901 --> 01:58:56,430
If it happened today,
you know,

2540
01:58:56,431 --> 01:58:59,220
it's like we,
it's like finally we got one,

2541
01:58:59,470 --> 01:59:04,470
remember what's his face got busted.
Jimmy swaggart got busted with a 

2542
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:05,810
prostitute and he was crying about how 
he said,

2543
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,220
have you ever seen that?
Ever seen him crying?

2544
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:11,220
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

2545
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:16,250
It's so beautiful.
It's like one of the most instancy or 

2546
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,310
things you could see a person doing 
their life and when you watch it,

2547
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:20,940
it sort of inoculates you to insincerity
because he gets a look at it.

2548
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:21,540
Go,
oh,

2549
01:59:21,541 --> 01:59:24,960
that's what it looks like.
No connection to reality,

2550
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:29,990
no emotional connection to their words,
no connection to me as the person 

2551
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,240
receiving these words.

2552
01:59:30,450 --> 01:59:32,910
It's almost sociopathic.
Sociopath.

2553
01:59:32,911 --> 01:59:37,890
Again,
it's craziness and it's beautiful.

2554
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:40,020
It's beautiful.
It's one of my favorite things to watch.

2555
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:40,960
Let's watch.
I haven't seen.

2556
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:46,250
Pull it up.
Hold up Jimmy swaggart apologizes for 

2557
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:51,080
silly bitch.
And then there was the other guy who 

2558
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:51,240
said he saw 900 foot Jesus in the middle
of the desert.

2559
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:54,270
That's what I was thinking it was.
No,

2560
01:59:54,271 --> 01:59:56,100
no.
One of them was like legit.

2561
01:59:57,240 --> 02:00:01,020
Jimmy Swagger is the guy who got busted.
Who saw the 900 foot.

2562
02:00:01,021 --> 02:00:02,790
Jesus,
I don't know man.

2563
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,640
Your religious coots.
No,

2564
02:00:05,641 --> 02:00:06,330
I like them.
No,

2565
02:00:06,331 --> 02:00:09,540
they're really are.
They're amazing to watch you.

2566
02:00:09,560 --> 02:00:12,330
You liked that dollar guy.
Creflo dollar.

2567
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,680
I record his shit.
I.

2568
02:00:14,681 --> 02:00:19,681
I know you're talking.
I record his shit because it's so 

2569
02:00:19,681 --> 02:00:19,681
ridiculous.

2570
02:00:19,681 --> 02:00:24,210
I want to address myself as best as I 
know how to those that I have wrong that

2571
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:31,900
I have sent against.
He'll go out and get hookers.

2572
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:37,070
First of all,
my wife Frances.

2573
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:44,550
God never gave a better helpmate and 
companion with the possible exception of

2574
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:56,110
that sleazy who?
What is this and as far as discussed,

2575
02:00:56,150 --> 02:01:01,150
fully playing this one man.
Funny Shit is real and cut.

2576
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:10,720
Yeah,
don't put this fucking parody bullshit 

2577
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:11,460
on it.
It's this cool.

2578
02:01:11,461 --> 02:01:12,270
Watch them cry.

2579
02:01:13,970 --> 02:01:16,550
It may be dark days for the swag,
a church,

2580
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:19,760
but as the Sky Clinton,
English people are talking about you.

2581
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:24,800
There you go,
and I would skip it today.

2582
02:01:25,851 --> 02:01:27,350
They knew all the details.

2583
02:01:30,050 --> 02:01:34,370
Oh man,
these mother fucking false prophets.

2584
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:39,820
Yeah.
It's an interesting thing that we have 

2585
02:01:39,820 --> 02:01:40,280
this just deep,
deep,

2586
02:01:40,281 --> 02:01:44,090
deep desire to believe that someone has 
answers.

2587
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:45,610
Leadership Addiction.
Yeah.

2588
02:01:46,230 --> 02:01:48,080
What's a chimpanzee shit,
right?

2589
02:01:48,190 --> 02:01:49,350
Yeah.
Leftover Championship.

2590
02:01:49,930 --> 02:01:50,470
Well,
it's,

2591
02:01:50,471 --> 02:01:51,970
no,
it's the guy.

2592
02:01:52,070 --> 02:01:53,380
The thing is,
man,

2593
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:57,850
there is a underneath everything there 
is.

2594
02:01:57,940 --> 02:02:01,120
I think this is what makes me different 
from a lot of people.

2595
02:02:01,121 --> 02:02:03,490
I think some people don't believe this.
I think underneath everything,

2596
02:02:03,491 --> 02:02:05,920
there's an intelligence that,
uh,

2597
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:11,890
that's filled with love.
It's just love that thing when you were 

2598
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:11,890
on Dmt and saying,
I love you,

2599
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:11,890
I love you,
I love you.

2600
02:02:11,890 --> 02:02:13,180
I love you.
I think that thing is real.

2601
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:16,450
And I think that that thing,
you don't need a leader.

2602
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,970
You don't need someone to tell you what 
that thing is saying to you.

2603
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:24,000
It's your own relationship with that 
thing and how closely you can 

2604
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,590
approximate what that thing is saying 
that defines your level of happiness.

2605
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:28,780
Uh,
in this incarnation.

2606
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:34,230
And there's,
there's people like that who falsely 

2607
02:02:34,230 --> 02:02:35,170
represent that thing who don't have 
never really experienced it.

2608
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:36,760
And that's why it seems like bullshit.

2609
02:02:37,820 --> 02:02:42,820
Yeah.
It seems like bullshit to everybody who 

2610
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:44,741
hasn't experienced it.
And when you run into extremely angry 

2611
02:02:44,741 --> 02:02:48,071
people that just have pitfall after 
pitfall in their life and the miserable 

2612
02:02:48,071 --> 02:02:50,060
experience after miserable experience 
in,

2613
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:55,120
you know,
you realize that they're just so 

2614
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:55,120
separate,
so,

2615
02:02:55,120 --> 02:02:58,400
so far separated from the frequency of 
happiness,

2616
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,500
you know,
and it sounds like some hippie bullshit,

2617
02:03:00,501 --> 02:03:02,630
the frequency of happiness really.
Hey man,

2618
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:07,720
some people just live in an economic 
downturn where there's a shitty economy 

2619
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:10,850
where they live and there's no jobs and,
and they were born ugly.

2620
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:12,380
So they're fucked.
Yeah,

2621
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,440
that too.
But there's also people that live like 

2622
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:20,021
that,
that are happy as fuck in that same 

2623
02:03:20,021 --> 02:03:22,211
environment and they have great friends 
and wonderful experiences with their 

2624
02:03:22,211 --> 02:03:25,571
loved ones and they're not constantly 
embroiled in bullshit because they 

2625
02:03:25,571 --> 02:03:26,630
figured out a way to orchestrate their 
environment.

2626
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:31,280
And that's one thing that we somehow or 
another are sort of responsible for.

2627
02:03:31,281 --> 02:03:31,550
Dylan.

2628
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:33,220
Exactly,
man.

2629
02:03:33,250 --> 02:03:36,040
I mean that's the important thing that 
the point that you're making there,

2630
02:03:36,041 --> 02:03:37,930
that's the most important point is that 
it's like,

2631
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:39,550
sure,
people are going to have.

2632
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,050
You're going to have to task trophies in
life.

2633
02:03:41,051 --> 02:03:43,960
Everyone asked catastrophes.
That doesn't mean you're bad,

2634
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:47,080
that doesn't mean you're wrong or that 
you've or you're cursed or anything.

2635
02:03:47,350 --> 02:03:52,350
All that matters is how you react to 
that and all that in the only way that 

2636
02:03:52,661 --> 02:03:57,661
you're going to react to that in any 
kind of way that's not terrified is if,

2637
02:03:59,581 --> 02:04:04,581
if you found a way to feel grateful is 
something Tom Green set about getting 

2638
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:05,710
cancer as this amazing,
uh,

2639
02:04:06,380 --> 02:04:10,900
a description of the feeling that comes 
when you have cancer.

2640
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,830
He said it's a combination of terror and
gratitude,

2641
02:04:15,370 --> 02:04:16,440
you know,
and it's like,

2642
02:04:16,450 --> 02:04:18,640
because once you get it and you get 
passing on a fuck,

2643
02:04:18,641 --> 02:04:19,270
I get to live.

2644
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:21,400
It really is this sense of like,
my God,

2645
02:04:21,401 --> 02:04:26,401
what a beautiful thing this is exists.
The terror things never going to go 

2646
02:04:26,401 --> 02:04:27,190
away.
As long as you're living in space,

2647
02:04:27,191 --> 02:04:29,230
you're going to be terrified.
We're in a fucking void,

2648
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,570
meteorite hit as etc.
Etc.

2649
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:33,170
But thEre is,
once you find that,

2650
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,170
that plate,
real gratitude,

2651
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:36,920
not gratitude,
where people shake their finger at you,

2652
02:04:36,921 --> 02:04:41,921
that you should be grateful,
but when you really plug into that 

2653
02:04:41,921 --> 02:04:41,921
fucking thing,
god damn it,

2654
02:04:41,921 --> 02:04:42,420
man.
Everything lights up.

2655
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:45,390
It doesn't matter if you're.
You know what the thing is,

2656
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:50,391
it's happening to you lose your joB,
your wife's cheating on and you're 

2657
02:04:50,391 --> 02:04:51,120
cheating on your whatever the thing is,
if you plug into that underlying thing,

2658
02:04:51,480 --> 02:04:53,640
fuck,
it's a beautiful,

2659
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:56,880
beautiful place and it's a very 
subversive idea.

2660
02:04:57,270 --> 02:05:02,270
The idea that everything is okay and 
that behind everything is just this 

2661
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:05,310
field of just the happiness frequency 
does that stuff

2662
02:05:05,470 --> 02:05:10,470
feeling?
That's the hardest thing to overcome in 

2663
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:10,960
life when you started out in a certain 
direction,

2664
02:05:10,961 --> 02:05:15,820
if you'd gotten fairly far in your life,
but you're really miserable and you have

2665
02:05:15,880 --> 02:05:20,880
a lot of obligations and you have lots 
of expectations and bills and a lot of 

2666
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:23,800
issues that keep you in the certain 
shitty environment and people don't know

2667
02:05:23,801 --> 02:05:28,801
how to manage that,
and I think that's why one of the most 

2668
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:32,881
important things to stress is get off on
the right track as quickly as you can 

2669
02:05:34,511 --> 02:05:36,730
with your life.
I mean by the right track,

2670
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:38,950
I mean,
whatever the right track is for you.

2671
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:44,760
I don't want to say don't listen to your
parents because you might be an idiot 

2672
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:44,760
and your parents might be dead,
right,

2673
02:05:45,370 --> 02:05:50,370
but you might have an idea that your 
parents can't wrap their fucking puny 

2674
02:05:50,370 --> 02:05:53,710
brains around to you.
You might be talented in one way,

2675
02:05:53,711 --> 02:05:56,200
shape,
or form that your father doesn't want to

2676
02:05:56,201 --> 02:05:58,470
see his creation go off to be.

2677
02:05:58,750 --> 02:06:00,750
And ultimately you are your own person.
You,

2678
02:06:00,751 --> 02:06:05,751
you really.
There's so many people that have lived 

2679
02:06:05,751 --> 02:06:05,751
their life for other people and they're 
miserable.

2680
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:10,830
You know,
I've never met an ecstatic son of the 

2681
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:12,250
owner of a business who runs the 
business with his father.

2682
02:06:12,490 --> 02:06:17,490
I always see a man who probably would 
rather have carved his own path in life 

2683
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:21,511
and it's just caught up in the wake of 
another man because that other man 

2684
02:06:21,511 --> 02:06:21,511
raised him.
You know,

2685
02:06:21,511 --> 02:06:22,010
they don't,
but you,

2686
02:06:22,011 --> 02:06:24,310
you see a guy who runs his own joint,
you know,

2687
02:06:24,311 --> 02:06:29,311
and like they're fucking happy and they 
have like zest and whatever they're 

2688
02:06:29,311 --> 02:06:29,311
doing,
whether they're.

2689
02:06:29,311 --> 02:06:30,480
They run a pizza place,
you know,

2690
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:31,480
I mean,
I've met guys.

2691
02:06:31,660 --> 02:06:35,540
There's a deli that I go to all the time
and canoga park cabaretta,

2692
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,780
the guy who owns a dave,
nicest fucking guy in the world.

2693
02:06:37,780 --> 02:06:38,950
He goes,
always smile and laugh,

2694
02:06:38,951 --> 02:06:40,990
and the people that are happy says 
joint.

2695
02:06:40,991 --> 02:06:42,580
You know what I mean?
I mean you.

2696
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:45,040
It could be anything.
It could be a restaurant,

2697
02:06:45,070 --> 02:06:50,070
it could be a,
a fucking starbucks that's just hooked 

2698
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:50,070
up,
right?

2699
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:50,710
It's your spot.
People like go in there,

2700
02:06:50,860 --> 02:06:53,560
you know,
it's like a little spot where people can

2701
02:06:54,220 --> 02:06:59,220
have their own little positive,
happy energy as long as that's what you 

2702
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:02,401
want to do.
Whatever the f you want to really run a 

2703
02:07:02,401 --> 02:07:03,430
starbucks or run a coffee shop or run a 
fucking jazz studio,

2704
02:07:03,431 --> 02:07:06,760
who gives a shit,
whatever the fuck you you're drawn to,

2705
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:08,290
you've got to do that,
man.

2706
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:11,760
That's so fucking important.
And people with their,

2707
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:16,950
their escape clauses and fucking 
parachute plans and well,

2708
02:07:18,431 --> 02:07:23,431
I can always pull out if this doesn't 
work and I got a backup here and then I 

2709
02:07:23,431 --> 02:07:24,010
got a backup there.
Man,

2710
02:07:24,011 --> 02:07:27,550
you better not back up too much,
but you got to travel light.

2711
02:07:27,580 --> 02:07:30,370
You got to travel light psychically.
You have to have very,

2712
02:07:30,371 --> 02:07:35,371
very few options if you really want to 
make whatever the fuck it is happen in a

2713
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:36,340
very few of them.

2714
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:41,430
I love this.
When you remember when we first got to 

2715
02:07:41,430 --> 02:07:44,401
be friends,
you said something to me when I was 

2716
02:07:44,401 --> 02:07:44,950
sitting in that fucking desk working as 
a talent coordinator.

2717
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,180
Stuck is stuck if be dude like really 
fucking stuck,

2718
02:07:49,240 --> 02:07:50,000
you know,
I like,

2719
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:52,570
I can still remember flash,
you know,

2720
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:57,571
like when people say things to you 
sometimes and your brain goes and takes 

2721
02:07:57,571 --> 02:07:59,370
a picture of freeze frames that because 
it's like you listened to that.

2722
02:07:59,371 --> 02:08:04,371
I listened to that and I remember 
sitting there talking to you at the 

2723
02:08:04,371 --> 02:08:07,720
shitty fucking desk job and you're like,
you just got to jump man.

2724
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:10,720
You just gotta go for it.
And you just gotta jump in.

2725
02:08:10,721 --> 02:08:13,920
You just gotta go for it.
And man that,

2726
02:08:13,921 --> 02:08:16,180
uh,
I knew you were right.

2727
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:21,840
But god dammit,
what a terrifyinG thing it as they hear 

2728
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:21,840
that at first,
you know,

2729
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,980
it's,
it's a terrifying fucking thing,

2730
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:24,640
you know?
But,

2731
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:28,450
and you know,
maybe making like if I jumped right when

2732
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:30,220
you said that it might not have been the
greatest time,

2733
02:08:30,221 --> 02:08:32,500
you do have to have a little bit of 
strategy involved in it,

2734
02:08:32,501 --> 02:08:33,660
but yeah,
you,

2735
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:38,780
there is a where you are right now and 
there is where you want to be and the 

2736
02:08:38,780 --> 02:08:42,070
distance between those two things will 
create a vertigo.

2737
02:08:42,170 --> 02:08:43,610
Well,
you had the most important thing,

2738
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,830
which is the thing that you wanted to 
do.

2739
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:47,780
You wEre good at.
You want it to be a comedian.

2740
02:08:47,781 --> 02:08:49,400
You were funny,
you were creative,

2741
02:08:49,401 --> 02:08:52,970
you original.
So that was the most important thing and

2742
02:08:52,971 --> 02:08:54,410
the most difficult thing to get.
And I was like,

2743
02:08:54,411 --> 02:08:55,940
this other stuff is what's holding you 
back.

2744
02:08:56,180 --> 02:09:01,180
Well you need to be doing is just 
focusing on this thing because you're 

2745
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:01,180
awesome at it.
All you have to do is just do it.

2746
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:05,620
Like the ability to do it correctly once
achieved doesn't really go away unless 

2747
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:08,360
you lose the fucking plot.
You know,

2748
02:09:08,361 --> 02:09:11,300
you lose the frequency in life.
I mean if you're a comic,

2749
02:09:11,301 --> 02:09:13,910
I expect to expect to get better.
You know,

2750
02:09:13,911 --> 02:09:18,911
I feel like I've had better sets like 
these last couple of months than I've 

2751
02:09:18,911 --> 02:09:23,741
ever had in my life.
I've had better moments I think on my 

2752
02:09:23,741 --> 02:09:23,741
moments are better.

2753
02:09:23,741 --> 02:09:26,270
I think like the like new bits are 
coming together in a better way.

2754
02:09:26,271 --> 02:09:31,271
Like I'm super super pleased with things
because I'm concentrating on it because 

2755
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:35,291
I've worked at it for a couple of 
decades and I think that as long as you 

2756
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:39,971
recognize that that's what happens,
that as long as you live your life the 

2757
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:44,591
way we were talking earlier,
the right way without too much bullshit 

2758
02:09:44,591 --> 02:09:48,431
and distractions,
too many negative karmic moments that 

2759
02:09:48,431 --> 02:09:49,640
flood you with regret and fuck with your
creativity.

2760
02:09:49,970 --> 02:09:52,940
That's one of the most important things 
about being creative.

2761
02:09:52,970 --> 02:09:56,000
One of the most important things for me 
is being nice when I'm,

2762
02:09:56,060 --> 02:10:00,060
when I'm like as nice as manY people as 
I can and I'm as,

2763
02:10:00,061 --> 02:10:04,160
as easygoing as possible and as 
forgiving as possible.

2764
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:09,370
I am the most happy.
I'm my most happiest when I'm dealing 

2765
02:10:09,370 --> 02:10:10,000
with people and like being forgiving 
and,

2766
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:15,020
and,
and being friendly and then I have less 

2767
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:15,020
shit on my mind.

2768
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:18,970
And then I can tune into creativity 
because I don't understand exactly where

2769
02:10:20,181 --> 02:10:22,460
my creativity comes from,
but as in,

2770
02:10:22,510 --> 02:10:27,510
you know,
a lifetime of trying to figure out what,

2771
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:31,190
what frequency I tune into when I do my 
best,

2772
02:10:31,191 --> 02:10:35,930
whether it's drawing or whether writing 
or anything creative for me,

2773
02:10:35,931 --> 02:10:40,931
I have to have all these ducks in a row.
And the big duck is my own psychic 

2774
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:46,160
psychic,
but my own consciousness,

2775
02:10:46,170 --> 02:10:46,650
my,
my,

2776
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:50,180
my appraisal of my own consciousness.
How am I,

2777
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:53,720
how am I interacting with this world 
that I'm finding myself in?

2778
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:57,320
Am I out of control and my fucking too 
much gas on a break.

2779
02:10:57,321 --> 02:10:59,830
So my too much breaks down enough gas.
Uh,

2780
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,760
what am I,
what am I holding myself back?

2781
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:05,870
Am I limiting myself with my diet?
Am I limiting myself with my actions?

2782
02:11:05,871 --> 02:11:08,960
Am I limiting myself with my.
What am I doing in Missouri?

2783
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:10,220
Is everything cool?
Okay.

2784
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:13,430
Now if everything is cool,
then I can go to work.

2785
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:18,760
But if everything's not cool,
I have to figure out what the fuck is 

2786
02:11:18,760 --> 02:11:19,040
not cool and fix that.
And if I don't fix that,

2787
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:24,340
it'll be bumpy.
It'll be the whole thing will be me 

2788
02:11:24,340 --> 02:11:26,891
trying to duct tape this fucking ship 
together while it reenters orbit and 

2789
02:11:26,891 --> 02:11:27,800
fucking keep everything from falling 
apart,

2790
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:33,070
but as long as you give yourself an 
honest assessment of how you're thinking

2791
02:11:34,821 --> 02:11:36,350
and how you're interacting with the 
world,

2792
02:11:36,770 --> 02:11:41,770
that's where it gets fucking hard to do.
It's hard to take that first step and 

2793
02:11:41,770 --> 02:11:43,820
give yourself an honest look at 
yourself,

2794
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,830
give yourself an.
And then once you do that,

2795
02:11:45,831 --> 02:11:48,380
then it has to sort of become an ethic,
you know,

2796
02:11:48,381 --> 02:11:50,240
and you've got a welcome and when other 
people do it too.

2797
02:11:50,241 --> 02:11:53,480
Even haters when haters like point 
something out about you.

2798
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:55,270
That's correct.
You know,

2799
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,140
you got to like accept that like,
yeah,

2800
02:11:57,141 --> 02:11:59,690
sometimes they get ya.
Sometimes they're right,

2801
02:11:59,691 --> 02:12:00,160
you know,
you,

2802
02:12:00,161 --> 02:12:05,161
you did something douchey or you were a 
little weird there or you could have 

2803
02:12:05,161 --> 02:12:07,070
reacted a different way and it doesn't 
even necessarily mean you're meant to.

2804
02:12:07,071 --> 02:12:10,370
Like sometimes you just get picked door 
number two and it's like,

2805
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:13,030
what am I even saying this for?
You start saying something,

2806
02:12:13,060 --> 02:12:16,610
it's not even doesn't even represent 
necessarily how you feel.

2807
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:21,611
it's just a possibility of how to react 
and all of a sudden you're off to the 

2808
02:12:21,611 --> 02:12:22,800
races and then you're like,
nah,

2809
02:12:22,910 --> 02:12:23,420
you know.
I mean,

2810
02:12:23,421 --> 02:12:25,130
how many times have we said that in the 
conversation as well?

2811
02:12:25,131 --> 02:12:26,930
Maybe that doesn't make sense.
You know?

2812
02:12:26,931 --> 02:12:29,180
It's like you don't even know sometimes 
when you're saying things,

2813
02:12:29,630 --> 02:12:34,250
but when someone calls you out on that 
and they they put it's probably good for

2814
02:12:34,251 --> 02:12:34,310
you.

2815
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:39,310
It's not good for them because a lot of 
times haters get fucking completely 

2816
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:42,491
work.
You figured to hope you sucked full of 

2817
02:12:42,491 --> 02:12:43,250
million.
Duke's you drone world of semen and aids

2818
02:12:43,251 --> 02:12:48,251
and this is the people that get 
completely ridiculous with their hate 

2819
02:12:48,251 --> 02:12:51,230
and almost all of them are losers.
That's a real problem.

2820
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:54,590
When you look at like what a hater is,
there is no successful haters.

2821
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:59,620
There's no like bill clinton,
stop fucking commenting on youtube 

2822
02:12:59,620 --> 02:12:59,620
videos.
Fucking queer,

2823
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:03,971
you know,
it's like no one who actually 

2824
02:13:03,971 --> 02:13:05,981
accomplished anything is a hater,
but being a hater is important for 

2825
02:13:07,041 --> 02:13:12,041
people that are trying to accomplish 
things like having critics and hate can 

2826
02:13:12,041 --> 02:13:16,181
actually help you and fuel you and make 
you aware of the broad spectrum of human

2827
02:13:17,571 --> 02:13:22,571
behavior,
especially like in a void of love and 

2828
02:13:22,571 --> 02:13:24,980
absence of the correct.
Like you don't lash out like that unless

2829
02:13:24,981 --> 02:13:29,981
you are in an absence.
Let's see you an absence of love and 

2830
02:13:29,981 --> 02:13:31,440
absence of personal pride and 
accomplishment of absence,

2831
02:13:31,441 --> 02:13:34,410
of feeling good,
like you don't feel good so you lash out

2832
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:40,040
because if you wanted to,
you could find something everyday that 

2833
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:41,520
you hated and just fill your day with 
hate all day,

2834
02:13:41,580 --> 02:13:43,770
anger and hate.
You could just do that.

2835
02:13:44,070 --> 02:13:48,300
You could just do that,
but you only do that if you're an idiot.

2836
02:13:48,940 --> 02:13:50,530
Yes.
Yeah.

2837
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:53,860
You're an idiot.
It's not idiot,

2838
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,010
idiot.
It's,

2839
02:13:55,070 --> 02:13:56,800
it's.
You're stuck in a terrible path.

2840
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,660
Yeah.
You're stuck in a pattern.

2841
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:00,640
Terrible pattern.
That is.

2842
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:04,180
It's not.
It doesn't help you in any way,

2843
02:14:04,181 --> 02:14:07,450
shape or form,
and in fact it limits you by keeping you

2844
02:14:07,451 --> 02:14:08,740
in this sort of,
this,

2845
02:14:08,741 --> 02:14:12,820
this,
this negative mindset.

2846
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:15,460
It's hard for me to relate to those 
haters.

2847
02:14:15,490 --> 02:14:15,980
You know,
the,

2848
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:21,230
the new internet breed of haters,
because I didn't have that when I was 

2849
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:23,620
like a lot of douche bags I can relate 
to because I can think,

2850
02:14:23,621 --> 02:14:25,150
oh yeah,
I was that kind of douche bag.

2851
02:14:25,151 --> 02:14:30,151
I know what that kind of douche bag is,
but internet haters is more difficult,

2852
02:14:30,161 --> 02:14:31,630
you know,
like a tweet,

2853
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:36,660
tweet haters.
But I've noticed that if you get hate 

2854
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:37,360
tweets,
I'll go to their timeline.

2855
02:14:37,361 --> 02:14:39,570
Sometimes they're all hate and it's all 
hate.

2856
02:14:39,571 --> 02:14:41,920
You scan down and it's just one vial 
thing.

2857
02:14:41,921 --> 02:14:46,921
There's many.
It's like they've got a list of people 

2858
02:14:46,921 --> 02:14:47,920
and they just are like launching 
vileness it as many people as they can.

2859
02:14:48,190 --> 02:14:51,220
It's a strange,
not just like one every five.

2860
02:14:51,221 --> 02:14:54,160
It's like if you have 40 hate tweets in 
a row,

2861
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,700
you've gone beyond irony.
Now you're just,

2862
02:14:57,730 --> 02:15:02,730
you're crazy.
Like now you're just some weird lunatic 

2863
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:04,420
firing missiles into the void for no 
reason.

2864
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:05,950
It's very strange,
man,

2865
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:06,720
but other than

2866
02:15:06,770 --> 02:15:11,770
you're and you're choosing to do that,
you're choosing to try to reach out and 

2867
02:15:11,770 --> 02:15:15,440
affect someone in a negative way instead
of concentrating on your own life

2868
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:19,870
like you have made it more important to 
do that.

2869
02:15:19,900 --> 02:15:23,710
Then anything else you were doing right 
then because you chose it,

2870
02:15:23,711 --> 02:15:25,780
you chose it as your writing.
Those things.

2871
02:15:25,960 --> 02:15:30,340
You chose it above any self improvement.
You were doing any creative work.

2872
02:15:30,341 --> 02:15:33,370
You are doing any business work.
You were doing,

2873
02:15:33,550 --> 02:15:35,900
any personal emails you've got to get 
out.

2874
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:36,310
No,
no,

2875
02:15:36,311 --> 02:15:41,311
no.
You chose to call someone you know a 

2876
02:15:41,311 --> 02:15:42,280
terrible name on twitter like you chose 
to say,

2877
02:15:42,281 --> 02:15:45,820
I hope this a dumb cunt drowned in a 
river of aids.

2878
02:15:45,970 --> 02:15:47,890
You decided to put that onto dallas.
Your.

2879
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:50,830
That was your choice at that moment.
Unless it's really funny.

2880
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:53,020
If it's funny,
then it's different.

2881
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:55,010
It's funny.
You're not going to 50.

2882
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,540
You know what I mean?
If it's funny,

2883
02:15:56,541 --> 02:16:01,541
you want to have 50,
but it's like when you go and look and 

2884
02:16:01,541 --> 02:16:01,541
like not only is the person just 
insulted you,

2885
02:16:01,541 --> 02:16:04,880
there is an insult to like,
we're too fucking yet.

2886
02:16:04,910 --> 02:16:07,220
Just like anderson cooper,
I've seen these,

2887
02:16:07,221 --> 02:16:07,350
these

2888
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:12,410
texts,
the beaver do say they want to kick the 

2889
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:12,960
years,
ask idiots.

2890
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,250
Mma fighters are constantly dealing with
them.

2891
02:16:15,410 --> 02:16:15,780
Yeah.
They,

2892
02:16:15,910 --> 02:16:17,620
they'll like and they'll troll you.
They'll,

2893
02:16:17,650 --> 02:16:20,020
they'll get you locked in on,
you know,

2894
02:16:20,021 --> 02:16:25,021
uh,
an argument and then you go back and 

2895
02:16:25,021 --> 02:16:26,761
forth.
One of them that I thought was really 

2896
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:26,761
hilarious was a,
there's a woman who's a,

2897
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:29,840
a comedy writer,
and she got into online twitter with a

2898
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:31,160
chris brown.
Oh yeah,

2899
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:32,980
yeah.
Jenny was her name.

2900
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:35,890
I can't remember if I.
She's a,

2901
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,990
she's a very funny but yeah.
And people like,

2902
02:16:37,991 --> 02:16:40,930
he viciously attacked her and that's 
what I go.

2903
02:16:40,931 --> 02:16:43,550
Why would he do that?
So then I read it and he's like,

2904
02:16:43,860 --> 02:16:45,400
damn,
I'm looking to old.

2905
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:46,630
And she,
she goes,

2906
02:16:46,631 --> 02:16:47,440
uh,
yeah.

2907
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:51,310
Isn't it funny being a complete piece of
shit as a human being tends to age you?

2908
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:53,830
I'm paraphrasing.
I don't know exactly how she said it,

2909
02:16:54,130 --> 02:16:59,130
but uh,
and then he went at her and this and 

2910
02:16:59,130 --> 02:17:01,841
that,
but she started it like he didn't beat 

2911
02:17:01,841 --> 02:17:01,841
her up.
Okay.

2912
02:17:01,841 --> 02:17:04,870
And this is like years later to have 
someone sniping at you constantly.

2913
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:08,260
It's got to be annoying and I'm not 
sticking up for chris brown in any way,

2914
02:17:08,261 --> 02:17:10,600
shape or form or anybody that beats up 
the girlfriend.

2915
02:17:10,960 --> 02:17:12,700
But she started it.
She,

2916
02:17:12,710 --> 02:17:16,080
she decided to tag him in that and,
and,

2917
02:17:16,081 --> 02:17:19,210
and tweet him and fuck with him and get 
him to react to her.

2918
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,620
And everybody's like,
oh,

2919
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,360
he viciously attacked her.
Like,

2920
02:17:22,361 --> 02:17:24,730
listen,
don't put your finger in the cage if you

2921
02:17:24,731 --> 02:17:26,170
don't want to get bit,
you know,

2922
02:17:26,171 --> 02:17:27,580
he beats up women.
Okay,

2923
02:17:27,581 --> 02:17:28,520
and whaT are you doing?
What do you,

2924
02:17:28,550 --> 02:17:33,550
what do you,
what are you doing by stirring it up 

2925
02:17:33,550 --> 02:17:33,550
with him?
Yeah,

2926
02:17:33,550 --> 02:17:33,700
exactly.

2927
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:37,000
She instigated a dummy,
dummy reacted.

2928
02:17:37,001 --> 02:17:42,001
She analyzed his psychology.
She knows this is a man who will swing 

2929
02:17:42,001 --> 02:17:42,001
it.
A lady,

2930
02:17:42,001 --> 02:17:44,890
she came out and won some sassy shit.
And it's like,

2931
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:49,900
it's,
it's like throwing salmon in front of a 

2932
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:49,900
bear.
Clearly.

2933
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:49,900
But

2934
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:50,680
that's not how they reported it.
It was.

2935
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:54,320
He viciously went after her,
viciously attacked her.

2936
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:56,680
When she started it,
she was dancing.

2937
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:02,600
Enjoy.
The moment that dumbed down were 

2938
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:02,600
responded to her.
She must've done a fucking tap dance.

2939
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:06,880
I wonder because I would think that if 
there's a guy who's like really violent 

2940
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:10,661
and you're a woman,
I would think just the fact that that 

2941
02:18:10,661 --> 02:18:12,941
guy knows who you are and you can't 
defend yourself if you ever ran into 

2942
02:18:12,941 --> 02:18:12,941
him.
Chris thought,

2943
02:18:12,941 --> 02:18:14,960
yes,
absolutely you don't think of crispr.

2944
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,510
She said a bunch of mean shit about him 
and he,

2945
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:21,530
he saw somewhere he might palm her face 
inspire mansion.

2946
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:26,300
I'm saying if no one was around,
no one was around in her mind.

2947
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:30,050
She has to realize that if she ran into 
that guy and no one was there to protect

2948
02:18:30,051 --> 02:18:32,270
her and there was no security cameras,
there was no witnesses.

2949
02:18:32,480 --> 02:18:35,300
He might do something to her.
That's reality.

2950
02:18:35,330 --> 02:18:38,930
Okay.
And that feeling is why it's dangerous.

2951
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:41,840
That feeling is what I mean.
That has to be in her head.

2952
02:18:42,170 --> 02:18:43,640
You start fucking with a guy like that.

2953
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:48,640
The beat up his girlfriend in her head,
she has to know that if her husband 

2954
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:49,730
isn't there or some know maybe her 
husband isn't there.

2955
02:18:49,731 --> 02:18:51,860
I don't know who her husband is.
Her husband might be kind of a pussy.

2956
02:18:51,861 --> 02:18:56,861
You might fold under pressure.
I mean you might run into a situation 

2957
02:18:56,861 --> 02:18:57,770
where it's chris brown and you and then 
what do you do?

2958
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:58,990
What do you do then?
What are you going to.

2959
02:18:58,991 --> 02:19:02,010
If I would have to be so stone to like 
get to that place now,

2960
02:19:02,020 --> 02:19:02,990
it'd be like,
fuck man.

2961
02:19:02,991 --> 02:19:07,991
If I ever ran into.
I hope I don't get attacked by chris 

2962
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:07,991
brown.
I got you.

2963
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:11,830
You get in an argument with them on 
twitter back and forth and saying chris 

2964
02:19:11,830 --> 02:19:15,581
brown paint while you're not arguing 
with them on twitter where you're a 

2965
02:19:15,581 --> 02:19:18,191
woman and he wants to kick your ass.
I'm not saying he wanted to kick her 

2966
02:19:18,191 --> 02:19:18,380
ass,
but I'm saying if you know a man is or a

2967
02:19:18,381 --> 02:19:23,381
beat up a woman and then she is now 
locked in online in this like verbal 

2968
02:19:23,871 --> 02:19:28,871
insult battle back and forth.
He's saying he's going to fart in her 

2969
02:19:28,871 --> 02:19:28,871
and he's

2970
02:19:28,871 --> 02:19:28,960
saying he's gonna.
Uh,

2971
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:34,030
yeah.
I said he's gonna like jerk off on her 

2972
02:19:34,030 --> 02:19:34,030
and foreigner mouth and stuff like crazy
shit.

2973
02:19:34,030 --> 02:19:38,770
And you know,
to be a chick that's got to be a little 

2974
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:38,770
fucking weird.
Right.

2975
02:19:38,770 --> 02:19:40,490
What about the black keys drummer and 
justin bieber?

2976
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:42,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

2977
02:19:42,381 --> 02:19:45,500
Patrick carney did a thing where he said
something like,

2978
02:19:45,501 --> 02:19:48,830
justin bieber doesn't deserve an emmy or
something along those lines,

2979
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:54,010
and the bieber fans went after him so he
just starts retweet and all of their 

2980
02:19:54,010 --> 02:19:57,860
stuff with like hilarious answer's 
always the best.

2981
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:01,430
It was really fucking sticking up for 
bieber are hilarious.

2982
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:04,910
But he turned himself into bieber.
He made his photo,

2983
02:20:04,911 --> 02:20:08,630
bieber and change his name to justin 
bieber and then with legs,

2984
02:20:08,631 --> 02:20:13,631
right?
And swag and all this different shit to 

2985
02:20:13,631 --> 02:20:16,331
people.
Like they would insult him and he would 

2986
02:20:16,331 --> 02:20:16,331
write swag.
Stop trying to pretend to be beaver.

2987
02:20:16,331 --> 02:20:17,870
You not be with.
You're a fucking loser.

2988
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:23,230
Swag swag is such a great word to just 
say like that.

2989
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:31,181
Swag,
like especially if you're in a battle 

2990
02:20:31,181 --> 02:20:31,181
with justin bieber's fans,
if you just say swag,

2991
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:32,990
it like seeing that

2992
02:20:33,310 --> 02:20:36,100
the bieber army,
they attack a course,

2993
02:20:36,101 --> 02:20:41,101
so does the Brittany Spears army.
Neil hamburger a stirs them up every 

2994
02:20:41,101 --> 02:20:43,530
once in a while where he was getting 
attack for a long time by britain.

2995
02:20:43,790 --> 02:20:44,170
Brittany

2996
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:49,330
beers.
Remember that video with that guy 

2997
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:49,330
screaming.
Leave brittany alone.

2998
02:20:49,330 --> 02:20:50,610
Yes.
That was amazing.

2999
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:55,290
That video is one of my all time 
favorite youtube videos.

3000
02:20:55,570 --> 02:21:00,570
The guy's lying on his bed.
He's gay or than a mansion filled with 

3001
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:04,911
dicks and he's just leaving,
just crying with his hair,

3002
02:21:06,781 --> 02:21:09,360
flopping behind him on the pillow.
It's just,

3003
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:12,300
it's wonderful.
He's can't even get out of bed when he's

3004
02:21:12,301 --> 02:21:13,950
making this.
He's so gay.

3005
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:18,210
He's like drawn to the bed,
like a piece of metal to a giant magnet.

3006
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:22,410
He's just drawn to a bad luck.
It can't even get up.

3007
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:24,600
She's just crying,
looking into his camera.

3008
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:28,650
Cringe city at woman we were talking 
about earlier actually killed herself.

3009
02:21:28,710 --> 02:21:31,650
Duncan,
the woman's orgasm woman.

3010
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,240
Hmm.
Wow.

3011
02:21:33,241 --> 02:21:35,400
Betrayed by her body.
She lives in agony.

3012
02:21:35,401 --> 02:21:37,620
Not ecstasy.
Warning,

3013
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:41,010
sexual subject matter.
Get your dick out,

3014
02:21:41,011 --> 02:21:43,940
boys.
It's just her moaning for bad.

3015
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:51,190
I had not had medical treatment yet or 
any kind of medication I had.

3016
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:58,420
I had 50 orgasms in a row in a row.
Nonstop.

3017
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:02,890
This is a saturday night live sketch.

3018
02:22:03,030 --> 02:22:04,350
I thought I was going to die.

3019
02:22:05,160 --> 02:22:06,210
Oh,
gretchen milan.

3020
02:22:06,211 --> 02:22:09,030
And suffers from persistent genital 
arousal disorder.

3021
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:14,040
A rare condition that makes her 
physically but not psychologically 

3022
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:16,320
aroused all the time.
Doctors do not agree on what causes it,

3023
02:22:16,321 --> 02:22:18,870
but they do agree on how facilitating 
can be.

3024
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:24,680
Gretchen,
who lives in spring hill so she can't 

3025
02:22:24,680 --> 02:22:26,781
work.
She's tried to get disability and come 

3026
02:22:26,781 --> 02:22:26,781
twice and failed each time.

3027
02:22:26,781 --> 02:22:31,130
Income podcast,
my case had its limited number of 

3028
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:31,130
appeals.
Yeah.

3029
02:22:31,130 --> 02:22:35,640
She killed herself I guess in a couple 
of months ago or something where we were

3030
02:22:36,911 --> 02:22:37,160
almost

3031
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:41,900
6:18,
so I'm all right man.

3032
02:22:41,901 --> 02:22:44,390
Well we have to tell people that you're 
not going to be with us this weekend,

3033
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:49,670
unfortunately.
It's a some really crazy hell shit.

3034
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:50,820
Yeah,
my mom.

3035
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:51,860
Super sick.
I got to go.

3036
02:22:51,861 --> 02:22:52,880
Say goodbye to my mom.

3037
02:22:53,010 --> 02:22:58,010
Yeah,
you're like literally say goodbye like 

3038
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,010
your mom's dying this weekend.
Possibly.

3039
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:58,010
Possibly,
yeah,

3040
02:22:58,010 --> 02:22:59,580
maybe a few weeks,
but a while.

3041
02:22:59,581 --> 02:23:00,530
I want to like,
you know,

3042
02:23:00,531 --> 02:23:05,531
you make sure you don't want to catch 
her while she's completely aware and 

3043
02:23:05,531 --> 02:23:08,880
folks in columbus and cincinnati,
sam tripoli's going to take place,

3044
02:23:08,970 --> 02:23:12,060
the hilarious tripoli.
So if you want to send duncanson love,

3045
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:13,870
follow him on twitter.
Uh,

3046
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:18,920

3047
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,680

Listen man,

3048
02:23:19,681 --> 02:23:20,270
you're,
you're,

3049
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:22,350
um,
your health scare freaked me out,

3050
02:23:22,351 --> 02:23:23,310
man.
It really did.

3051
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:26,360
I would hate to live this life without 
you.

3052
02:23:26,460 --> 02:23:31,460
Thank you.
One of my favorite people and one of my 

3053
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:32,730
favorite people to talk to.
And you're just such a unique breadth of

3054
02:23:32,731 --> 02:23:36,060
fresh air in this strange world that we 
live in,

3055
02:23:36,061 --> 02:23:37,110
you know.
And uh,

3056
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:42,170
without you man,
I really think that my conversations 

3057
02:23:42,170 --> 02:23:42,570
would be less interesting.

3058
02:23:42,660 --> 02:23:47,660
you know,
I've had more interesting conversations 

3059
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:48,780
with you that I think I've had with 
anybody ever in life.

3060
02:23:48,781 --> 02:23:53,781
You,
you've made me think about things and I 

3061
02:23:53,781 --> 02:23:54,750
know we feed off of each other in some 
really strange way in these.

3062
02:23:54,890 --> 02:23:57,740
We go deeper and weirder when we're 
together.

3063
02:23:57,770 --> 02:24:00,810
Then when we were apart,
and it's to me,

3064
02:24:00,811 --> 02:24:01,640
uh,
you know,

3065
02:24:01,690 --> 02:24:03,240
[inaudible] just an awesome dude,
man.

3066
02:24:03,540 --> 02:24:06,340
I love you and I'm honored that we're 
friends and you,

3067
02:24:06,360 --> 02:24:08,760
you're a very important part of my life.
Likewise joe.

3068
02:24:08,761 --> 02:24:09,420
Thank you.
Yes,

3069
02:24:09,421 --> 02:24:14,421
you've definitely,
I accelerated my evolution and credit 

3070
02:24:14,421 --> 02:24:14,430
and you have mine.
We have each other.

3071
02:24:14,431 --> 02:24:16,050
We all,
we all have for each other.

3072
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:16,910
You know,
it's uh,

3073
02:24:16,980 --> 02:24:17,610
that's,
that's,

3074
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:22,700
that's the reality of a group of people 
hanging out that enjoy each other's 

3075
02:24:23,401 --> 02:24:27,750
company and then are all sort of like 
minded and honest about life and sort of

3076
02:24:27,751 --> 02:24:29,670
trying to get through it together.
We help each other.

3077
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:31,860
We've created our own community I can 
trust.

3078
02:24:31,861 --> 02:24:35,300
So I think part of it,
we're all part of that.

3079
02:24:35,340 --> 02:24:37,530
We're all part of it.
So that's it.

3080
02:24:37,531 --> 02:24:42,531
