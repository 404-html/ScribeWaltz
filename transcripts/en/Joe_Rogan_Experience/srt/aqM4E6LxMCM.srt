1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,540
All right,
we're live.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,030
We've been talking about doing this for 
a while.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,650
We thought we finally pull it off.
It's about time.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,510
What are you doing in town?
I,

5
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,440
I'm like came here and did a little 
surfing off the,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,710
off the plane.
Um,

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,900
then I had to do a USC thing where I did
a trained,

8
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:20,690
um,
Blake Griffin this morning,

9
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:22,260
this afternoon.
Oh,

10
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,370
okay.
I saw that picture.

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,180
Yeah.
So,

12
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:27,000
uh,
you're doing mixing it up and I may,

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,660
he shown me some how to dunk over a car 
and I was teaching them how to Western 

14
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,820
mass.
When you see a guy like that,

15
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,700
that's like a giant athlete like that,
don't you want to go man,

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,380
you will.
Fucking great radio voice.

17
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:45,381
I've never heard the radio,
the radio voice stand up your fucking 

18
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:45,550
mind.
Now you're like,

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,660
now you might like it.
Well,

20
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,680
you know,
we were at dinner,

21
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,450
I'd have the same vote.

22
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,200
Okay,
Gotcha.

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,770
They like and next on the stage 
yesterday can we to the main stage $14.

24
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,640
Kamikaze is nice and smooth.
What do you see?

25
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:07,550
Like a dude like that?
Do you want to tell him?

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Man,
what the fuck a body to be heavyweight 

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,560
champion of the world was telling him.
I was like,

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,651
you're huge drips.
Like everything about you is just 

29
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:15,651
massive,
but you know,

30
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:18,150
and we're like,
I'm doing some under overs and some like

31
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:20,190
wrestling and I think he was kind of 
like,

32
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,730
let me like,
I felt like he was limping Armenia.

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,490
I was like,
pussy like fucking man.

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,870
Give me,
you know what I mean?

35
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,360
Like don't,
don't fucking big brother me right now.

36
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,900
I don't give me the,
the,

37
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,630
Oh,
I'm just a little kid.

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,870
So then once I fucking gave him that 
talk,

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,840
then he stepped it up a little bit.

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,200
I was like,
yeah,

41
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:40,230
don't don't do that to me motherfucker.
I'm a grown ass man.

42
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:43,440
I'm fucking six foot tall.
I'll fuck you up.

43
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:48,441
So don't live army right now.
It's funny because you are six foot 

44
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:55,581
tall,
but when you stand next to him and 

45
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:55,581
you're like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

46
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah Dude,
he's 6:10

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,440
Jesus Christ.
10 Man.

48
00:01:58,441 --> 00:01:59,280
Yeah,
it was a,

49
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:00,930
it was funny.
You know,

50
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:05,931
I was telling him like,
how you're so coordinated on the court 

51
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:05,931
and then you put some fucking gloves on 
and you can't,

52
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,680
what the,
what the fuck?

53
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:09,980
I won one,
two,

54
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,950
I'm going to just go,
like,

55
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:12,270
come on,
hold different things.

56
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,300
And then um,
he had his management coming to me and 

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,671
telling me he doesn't want to near kick 
and so of course we fucking need a kick 

58
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:23,991
because you can't tell me what you can't
do because he have fucked up knees or 

59
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:23,991
something.

60
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:23,991
Who knows?
I have no idea,

61
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,560
but he didn't know he did an and he 
didn't want to be embarrassed.

62
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,710
Like when you do something that you're 
not good at people,

63
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,750
especially cameras.
And so he,

64
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,860
uh,
no,

65
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,890
we did it.
A lot of those guys have fucked up 

66
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:36,890
knees,
right?

67
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,510
Of those photos.
Everybody is fucked up.

68
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:41,850
No biggie is huge.
That's a giant dude.

69
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Yeah.
If you could teach that guy how to kick 

70
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Jesus Christ,
fucking need to do,

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,340
could dunk over a car.
So I jumped,

72
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,400
jumped me.
It was fun.

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,750
Yeah.
I can only imagine.

74
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,030
I can only imagine,
but those guys,

75
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
there's so much more money in the NBA 
and you don't have to get your ass 

76
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,090
kicked.
That's what I told him.

77
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,090
I said,
hey man,

78
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,200
I need you to go to the NBA and tell 
them you guys need enforcers like 

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,410
hockey.
I'll be there.

80
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,850
I'll be your man.
You know what I'm saying?

81
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:11,851
So you're telling me you go out to say 
Yo Cowboy fucking number 23 keeps 

82
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:11,851
hitting me in the ribs.
You know,

83
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:11,950
I don't,
I don't like them.

84
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:16,951
I'll go out there.
I'll just iced the fool right there on 

85
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,781
the middle of the court.
And it is weird that hockey is the only 

86
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,290
sport where you're allowed to beat 
people up in the middle of the game.

87
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,370
Yeah.
My Buddy Scott Parker,

88
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:23,710
I mean he is the enforcer for the car as
well.

89
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,700
He's retired now,
but I mean that was his job.

90
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,720
So you know,
he would tell me he was like mentally 

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,061
have to prepare like him and I talk a 
lot about just the preparation of 

92
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:34,600
fighting and how he'd get game ready 
because he knew he was fighting.

93
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:39,601
Whoever was the other enforcers or he'd 
be ready and it's cool like interacting 

94
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:40,210
with them in that sense,
but yeah,

95
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,590
they like promote it like,
oh,

96
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,750
you're messing with my goalie or all 
year.

97
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,330
So they send up the enforce or like it's
just,

98
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,580
it's because it's Canadian.
What a cool job.

99
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,750
It's a great job.
Fuck.

100
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,110
Like you're Joe.
Get Him in here.

101
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,560
You know what I mean?
So it's just funny that no other sport 

102
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,350
or any other sport.
If you fight,

103
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,770
you're not just ejected from the game,
you're subject to penalties.

104
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,550
You might get suspended in hockey.
It's a normal thing.

105
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,690
You mean if you're,
if you,

106
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,750
if versus you've played just hold off 
and jump need someone's whole face off 

107
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,780
in the middle of the game.
That would be huge.

108
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,580
And then they'd be in big trouble.
Do you think it's [inaudible] hockey?

109
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:19,120
Like did not that stable because you're 
on skates.

110
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,330
Like it takes a lot of fucking skate 
knowledge to be able to brawl while 

111
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,260
you're on skates.
I can barely fucking stand on skates.

112
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:27,190
I don't know how to ice skate.

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,540
No,
I'm terrible at it.

114
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,110
I,
uh,

115
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,550
I did it about two years ago and thought
I was cool to try to do the hockey stop 

116
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,640
fucking cocky in Bam asked out on the 
fucking eyes and that was,

117
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,890
that was the end of my,
uh,

118
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,420
my hockey dreams.
So I'm fighting him no idea.

119
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:46,030
So I would imagine if you could teach a 
dude like,

120
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,670
dude who's like a figure skater,
teach them some,

121
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,790
like real good kicks.
You could fuck somebody up,

122
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,200
but you're not allowed to do that,
right?

123
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,470
You can't just figure skate.
We'll kick someone's fucking head off.

124
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,990
Juggler die.
No,

125
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,140
no.
Um,

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,660
I don't think they can raise either knee
or anything.

127
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,630
They can't bring any scuffs off your 
feet down.

128
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,780
What about superman?
Punch wouldn't be effective.

129
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,220
They wouldn't even know that you were 
throwing a kick came at him like full,

130
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:11,720
like,
you know,

131
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,790
thor in the movie.

132
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,260
Troy.
Excuse me.

133
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,270
So like a trick,
like.

134
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,290
Yeah.
I don't know.

135
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,390
Yeah,
it would have to be something.

136
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:24,010
No one expected half deal.
Yeah,

137
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:29,100
it,
it's just weird that they don't have 

138
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,361
that basketball.
Basketball becomes less and less 

139
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:30,361
popular.
Maybe.

140
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:32,140
Maybe they would have to bring it in.
So what did you know in hockey?

141
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,410
The enforcers can't wear a face mask.
Kill it.

142
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:37,720
They can only wear a helmet with no.
With no guard.

143
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,790
It's like a penalty.
If they do.

144
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,640
That's interesting.
So they can't take punishment.

145
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,600
That makes sense.
Yeah.

146
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:48,601
I mean,
so if one guy had it on and one guy 

147
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:50,491
didn't exactly say it but not have it,
but still lady's grabbing just throttle 

148
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,730
punch through the plastic and that's 
insane,

149
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,350
right?
Yeah.

150
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,820
It is kind of insane.
Insane.

151
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,550
Yeah.
It's,

152
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,920
it's,
it's a fucked up job.

153
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
That's a weird gray area sport,
but I think a lot of it is also because 

154
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,250
it's Canadian Canada,
they're just them.

155
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,070
There's more men up there.
I'll give you,

156
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,070
you know what I'm saying?
Sure.

157
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,340
It's like there's a lot of policies in 
America.

158
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I mean there's a lot of men in America,
a lot of places and there's a lot of 

159
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,560
posts and in Canada I think fistfights 
or moral or a normal thing like think 

160
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:24,101
about,
we're back pre biblical and we're in a 

161
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:24,560
political sciences.
Okay.

162
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,350
I'm gonna throw my head in there.
Cool,

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,440
okay.
And all of these policies you think so 

164
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,680
many women,
us,

165
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,750
Alpha males would have.
We would just go and like I think I'm 

166
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:37,750
gonna take your girl and just beat his 
ass.

167
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,700
And the problem with that is you can 
never fucking sleep those days man.

168
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:44,300
Like the old days and shit.
Like you never sleep,

169
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,330
you know,
you would hear footsteps you like all 

170
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:49,330
fucking great.
You look out your window.

171
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,770
There's a thousand dudes coming over the
hill.

172
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,120
I just did.

173
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,020
But those wish a motherfucker would days
the Mongols that fucking just shooting 

174
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,191
arrows.
No one has a gun and fucking launching 

175
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,120
people on catapults.
Those kind of three big we have,

176
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,330
you know we got,
we don't have,

177
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,870
maybe they just barely came with arrows.
Swords definitely.

178
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:10,940
But what do they figure out?
Arrows,

179
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,360
like all those,
like the arrows are on the hieroglyphs 

180
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,791
right?
So that's like 2000 BC at least because 

181
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:22,010
I think the pyramid is 2,500
BC.

182
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:27,011
I think they dated that.
So I think if you're talking about when 

183
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:31,310
it was,
the invention of the arrows should 

184
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,310
probably know this.
I should know this,

185
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,960
but I have no idea.
I have no idea.

186
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,810
So long ass time ago.
Yeah.

187
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,000
They figured out a few things first.
Right?

188
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,660
They figured out like spears and then 
they figured out catapults.

189
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,661
Probably.
That was probably the next boat trip 

190
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:46,661
trebuchet,
right?

191
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:50,310
Trevor,
what does that trip is not a catapult 

192
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:50,330
trebuchet and though is called a 
trebuchet.

193
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,750
Can you google it?
Trebuchet.

194
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm saying it wrong.
Should I be Shay?

195
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,970
That was fucking quit google.
That's not bad trebuchet.

196
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,110
That's the original Caterpillar fucking 
telling me,

197
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,710
son.
That's amazing.

198
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,740
Yeah.
Even it's even spelled the way you 

199
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:11,740
pronounced it.

200
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Loose lip shade with a mouthful of 
school.

201
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,480
What do you got there?
What does that stuff a Copenhagen long 

202
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,480
cut.
Wintergreen.

203
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,800
Dangerous for you.
Is that bad for you?

204
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,980
Probably not.
Any more dangerous than marijuana.

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,390
Marijuana is not dangerous for you at 
all.

206
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,110
How dare you,
sir?

207
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:32,111
I don't feel like that is either.
Put that stuff does not like chew 

208
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:36,041
people's faces off and shit because 
there's one dude who shows up at a 

209
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:40,150
little kid schools to warn them of the 
dangers of chewing tobacco in his 

210
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,660
missing half his face.
I remember that dude on TV.

211
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Look at bone cancer in his face.
I don't mean to freak you out when I'm 

212
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:46,960
going out with my boots on babies.
So,

213
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,720
uh,
wow.

214
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,380
So face cancer from school.
You're good at face care for school.

215
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:52,550
I'm gonna.
Call it red bull and tell them,

216
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:52,850
hey,
I'm gonna.

217
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,980
Be the first guy to jump out of the 
astronaut thing you got there.

218
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,660
Don't need to shoot.
I'm just going in head first.

219
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,760
They'll bring it off.
Jesus Christ.

220
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,950
That's my mentality though,
Joey.

221
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,470
Like if I got in a car accident and lost
a leg or an arm,

222
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:05,530
I'd just,
I'd tell him,

223
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,840
pull the plug right there.
Shoot me.

224
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,370
I'm done.
One leg.

225
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh Man.
It'd be tough.

226
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,030
It'd be tough.
They got some good prosthetics now.

227
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,460
A lot of these guys that come back from 
Iraq and Afghanistan,

228
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,960
they do marathons now.
Poor.

229
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,730
Let me credit.
It's incredible.

230
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,810
It's incredible though,
isn't it?

231
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,010
It really is,
man.

232
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:24,900
But God damn it.
Yeah,

233
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,600
you would.
You'd be,

234
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,330
you were real close.
There's a couple things.

235
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,360
They sequence the gene of the flatworm 
recently and they're looking to try to 

236
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,510
figure out because of flatworms can 
regenerate.

237
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Like he'd cut them in half.
They become two completely different 

238
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,070
flatworms.
I think they also have the same 

239
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:46,221
memories,
like if one flatworm knows where the 

240
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,640
food is and you cut them in half of the 
both halves know where the food is.

241
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,910
So it's very confusing to them because 
they're trying to figure out what is 

242
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:52,910
that memory or is that just,
you know,

243
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,460
like lawyers and it's good question.
I think specifically the w,

244
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,360
what they know and the way they know 
what they believed that it's a memory,

245
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,030
some type of a memory.
Obviously a crude memory,

246
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,220
but uh,
they think that they're going to be able

247
00:10:05,221 --> 00:10:08,800
to figure out whether the next hundred 
years how to replace limbs that you,

248
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,020
you're going to be able to regenerate 
it.

249
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,880
The way of frog does or an alligator 
does.

250
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,570
Think about that next 100 years.
Think about what,

251
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,910
think about this iphone six year and the
next.

252
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,060
I mean nothing.
Do you remember the flip phone and the 

253
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,170
texting?
You were so happy with it too,

254
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,280
you know,
speaking of that,

255
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,810
do you know,
I mean you have kids,

256
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,350
so do you remember when you were 15,
16 years?

257
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:30,990
Have the call,
like,

258
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,640
hey Mr Rogan.
I'm,

259
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,670
is Sarah there?
Can I talk 9:00?

260
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:36,710
Phone off?
You know what I mean?

261
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Those days are gone.
Our kids will never have to unless you 

262
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,210
know the strong will take,
take their phone.

263
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,130
But do you even have a landline at home?
Yeah,

264
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:47,220
I got a landline but it's useless.
Never use it.

265
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,140
Okay.
So people like that,

266
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:51,810
right?
I mean you have a landline just in case,

267
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,070
but uh,
you know,

268
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,100
I have a landline because I live in the 
middle of nowhere and that's way I can 

269
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,100
get Internet.

270
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,080
There's like a hamster on a wheel and 
ever fast he's running it powers up my 

271
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,580
wifi and it's terrible.
I can't even to.

272
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,910
You have like one of those satellite 
Internet connections.

273
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,730
It's phone line,
bad 56 k?

274
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,300
Yeah.
It's like you can't do anything better.

275
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,530
Um,
if I,

276
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,830
if I wanted to download a podcast,
I'd have to start the download before I 

277
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,420
went to bed and maybe by noon the next 
day it be done.

278
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,720
Yeah.
I got like 48 hour download movie times,

279
00:11:24,721 --> 00:11:27,600
so I've got to really plan the movie 
online for a flight.

280
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,320
Netflix is ridiculous.
Netflix?

281
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,120
No,
we cannot load a Netflix.

282
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,380
They have satellite Internet now.
Nobody know.

283
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,920
You can get it all over the country.
Really?

284
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,570
Yeah.
Yeah,

285
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,240
yeah.
It's like,

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,360
just like direct TV,
they just point the dish with the 

287
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,750
satellite in the sky and it's not fast 
as like a fiber optic,

288
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,490
but it's pretty fast when you look into 
this.

289
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:48,390
Yeah.
You got to get that.

290
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,750
What I got going on is that's not 
biblical.

291
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,140
Yeah.
It sounds.

292
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,890
That sounds horrifying.
You like

293
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,840
you live in like a couple of decades 
ago.

294
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:01,150
I am and there's nothing they can do.
They can't lay wires or anything like 

295
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,970
that now.
They don't have.

296
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,110
They don't have it out there in my area.
I've tried.

297
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,120
I've tried to look into that satellite 
game.

298
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,370
Where are you at now?
Edgewood,

299
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:10,780
New Mexico,
right on the backside of Santa Fe.

300
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:15,781
Albuquerque.
And you're there because of Jackson's 

301
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:15,781
because you could be close to Jackson.
Well,

302
00:12:15,781 --> 00:12:17,920
I moved to Albuquerque to help Linda 
Garcia with the Roger Ward to fight.

303
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,810
And I never left.
I literally called my grandma,

304
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:21,460
my grandma she's watching right now 
live.

305
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,450
So I'll give a shot.
Um,

306
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,090
I literally showed up for Linda for a 
week and then now Greg Osby b is 50 

307
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,280
fiver and I never left.
I literally,

308
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:33,880
I had a house in Colorado.
My grandma took care of everything,

309
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,470
brought all my stuff down and just 
drove,

310
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:40,471
like,
which slowly come visit me and bring 

311
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:40,471
things down.

312
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:40,471
I never went home.
Wow.

313
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:40,471
It was wild.
Yeah.

314
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:41,600
So why was,
I just liked it so much there,

315
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,750
you know?
Uh,

316
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,310
in Colorado I was like kind of the,
at the gyms I was kind of the kid that 

317
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,830
no one would put a name on like a.
no one would claim me.

318
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Right.
I was like,

319
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,760
really?
Oh Man.

320
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:55,720
It was a hard time.
You know,

321
00:12:55,721 --> 00:13:00,721
that's.
And that's what the whole bmf ranch and 

322
00:13:00,721 --> 00:13:00,940
like me giving back to people came from 
because Oh,

323
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:01,960
drive here,
go here,

324
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,480
do this.
No one will put their name on me.

325
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,260
Like Dwayne,
I train with him,

326
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,840
but he would never put his name on me,
you know,

327
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:09,430
none of the gyms would like claiming I 
was just,

328
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,690
well I was a fuck up,
you know,

329
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,160
and I,
it was weird.

330
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:15,210
So it was just your young me crazy.
Yeah.

331
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,090
You know,
and they're like,

332
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,370
this dude,
I can't have this guy fighting for me.

333
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,030
Exactly.
He's just,

334
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,540
he's a loose cannon.
That's crazy.

335
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,300
Too crazy.
So I wanted to.

336
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,301
Greg,
he like took me in and like at that 

337
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:30,061
time,
George and a key to our dean and were 

338
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,361
shot.
It was like a family down there was 

339
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:32,361
crazy,
you know,

340
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:34,771
it was.
All of them were so welcoming and so I 

341
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:34,771
just,
I said,

342
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:35,620
this is it,
this is where I'm going to make my move.

343
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,110
And so,
so you,

344
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,670
you train there,
but you also built this crazy rent,

345
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,100
bad motherfucker rent,
which is pretty awesome.

346
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,630
I love that you did that.
I love it.

347
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,740
So what made you decide to do that?
I'm like,

348
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,360
I wanted a place where I could ride my 
full brother,

349
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:54,361
shoot my guns and all that.
So I looked at the city limits and land 

350
00:13:54,361 --> 00:13:56,860
that I got in Edgewood to buy in 
Colorado would have been out of control.

351
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,580
Outrageous.
So,

352
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,240
you know,
I told my grandfather is where I want to

353
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,120
went.
My grandfather said done.

354
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:02,020
I mean,
on a phone call.

355
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,540
My grandpa said,
done just what you want.

356
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,550
Got It.
Drove down with cash in hand,

357
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,610
bought me the property just slightly,
man.

358
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,360
It was the greatest dude on the planet 
man.

359
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:10,930
So,
uh,

360
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,260
yeah.
And I started training there and him and

361
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:16,930
my grandma would come down and uh,
you fucking curiosity now.

362
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,790
But uh,
you know,

363
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,830
it just,
it was like a dream for me.

364
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,860
And so now now I'm rooted.
And so did you build out there?

365
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,940
Was there,
was there a structure to there?

366
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,100
There was a house,
right.

367
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,130
And we extended the house,
built the gym,

368
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,830
now I just built dorms.
Which,

369
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,840
if you're going to build anything,
anyone listening,

370
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,140
make sure you get permits because I of 
course didn't because I'm a fucking 

371
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,140
idiot,
loser.

372
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,860
And a wild.
So I got a big red flag notice on my 

373
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:46,860
door.
Said,

374
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:46,860
dude,
get your permits done.

375
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,650
Got a picture here.
You want to see it?

376
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,930
Yeah,
I do want to say it.

377
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,260
So what do they do?
Does it delay you any further?

378
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:53,890
Because it's a cease and assist.
Don't,

379
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,720
don't.
Uh,

380
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,510
well they don't want to.
Oh Jesus.

381
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,110
Yeah.
Well notice the stop.

382
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,110
Stop work.
Bam.

383
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,840
So I had to jump through hoops,
you know,

384
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,760
go hire hiring one.
I had to spend all day.

385
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:11,270
I had to go to the Santa Fe county and 
really like get everything in line,

386
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,740
show my plans,
blah blah blah.

387
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,680
Pay The money and uh,
basically get the ball rolling for the,

388
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,400
for the,
uh,

389
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,500
for the performance.
I got it done now.

390
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,580
So there's places out here,
like if you want to build something in 

391
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,470
like Malibu near the ocean,
it takes fucking years and you got to go

392
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:27,200
through all sorts of red tape and this 
corruption and nonsense.

393
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,470
You have to deal with.
Exactly.

394
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,900
So I just felt it and I shouldn't have.
I have a buddy lives in Topanga.

395
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,510
He's under the coastal commission and he
just said,

396
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,650
fuck it.
If they catch me,

397
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:39,170
they catch me and he just built up,
did all this shit to his house.

398
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,720
It's been a fuck load of money on his 
house and just got away with it,

399
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,880
you know,
you can get away with it.

400
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:48,830
He can with wires hanging out of your 
wall,

401
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,390
stop work to get fined and then never 
get permits for years.

402
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,770
So I tried to like,
you know,

403
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:58,660
let people learn from my mistakes.
I'm kind of learning trial by fire,

404
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,890
kind of how I've lived my whole life.
So how many dorms did you build out 

405
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:03,890
there?
Um,

406
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,660
well as of right now it's a glorified 
horse.

407
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:06,830
Stable.
So,

408
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:11,831
um,
there's no dorms being built because of 

409
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:11,920
the work stoppage.

410
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,390
Stopped a,
just a way to get a permit again.

411
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:15,330
Yeah.
So now it's a,

412
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,300
it's a horse that because there was a 
horse stable underneath,

413
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,470
giant horse,
stable.

414
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:23,471
And then I built a rooms that I'm 
probably going to paint in holding the 

415
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:27,881
archery gear in.
I got a whole bunch of beds that I need 

416
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:29,630
a store and in a couple and I got guys 
that come out that'll probably store and

417
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:34,631
some of those rooms with two beds.
Do you think that this is what's going 

418
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:37,901
to be your transition after you're done 
finding that you'll eventually just run 

419
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:37,901
a camp?
I don't know Joe,

420
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:38,360
I just,
you know,

421
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,420
teaching to me like if you and I were 
doing something I could show you 

422
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,540
something you had a problem with for me 
to like come in and teach a class and be

423
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,290
really hard.
I don't know how that fucking even works

424
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:48,650
like that.

425
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,890
But you know,
at that time,

426
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,950
what would it be hard about it?
Like maybe getting a curriculum or 

427
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,700
something thei thought out like,
okay,

428
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:56,990
I'm going to teach this,
this and this today.

429
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,760
I don't,
I just don't know.

430
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I see what you're saying.
Maybe if you had somebody that like 

431
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,130
Kinda organize it for you and you guys 
came in and,

432
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,280
or you know,
have guys like Henry or someone who was 

433
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:09,280
like a,
a,

434
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,300
a coach already work with them like 
Winkeljohn and Jackson work together.

435
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,990
Sure,
absolutely.

436
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,610
Yeah,
I mean I have a great,

437
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,210
you know,
Jafari and super direct thing.

438
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,650
One of my great friends and coaches,
you know,

439
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,930
he uh,
he lives out there with me helping me,

440
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,870
who trains all the guys and we got,
you know,

441
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,550
Henry training with the Thai guy.
So we have a good,

442
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,620
you know,
good stable of coaching and just 

443
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:33,620
bringing guys in.
Man.

444
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:33,740
I,
like I said earlier,

445
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,070
I didn't know how many directions.
So now when people come,

446
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:42,071
I want to be the guy like they asking 
what are you responsible now it's three 

447
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:42,071
bucks.
We don't have a fucking choice.

448
00:17:42,071 --> 00:17:42,071
But before I'd have to be like,
hey,

449
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,290
these guys were no go.
They didn't pay,

450
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,100
they didn't do this,
you know,

451
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,680
just like experiences I've had through 
my career.

452
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,010
And what do you do for cutting

453
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,120
weight?
What do you do for this?

454
00:17:51,121 --> 00:17:56,121
What do you believe it was just cool to 
be able to answer all the questions for 

455
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:56,121
the upcoming guys,
you know?

456
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:56,121
Yeah.
Um,

457
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,670
it's got to be a cool thing to be able 
to help guys in a way that like,

458
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,320
you wish somebody had helped you,
right?

459
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,590
Absolutely.
Because it's like a,

460
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,010
there's,
there's a real,

461
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,500
an area in the beginning of a fighter's 
career,

462
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:12,501
especially where they don't feel 
legitimate and sometimes a guy like you 

463
00:18:12,501 --> 00:18:13,380
taking them in and saying,
hey man,

464
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,990
like,
like what you're doing with felder,

465
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,170
right?
You know,

466
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:18,510
a guy who's a real talented guy,
very talented.

467
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,280
You take them in and then boom,
all of a sudden he's legit as fuck.

468
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,950
You know,
that's what everybody's saying too.

469
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:25,800
It's like everyone's saying,
oh,

470
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:27,660
he trains with Donald Shit.
Okay.

471
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,480
You know,
I mean,

472
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,110
that's kind of exactly like that in.

473
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,920
There's a lot of guys that come to when 
you come,

474
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,470
I want to be able to put my name on it.
You know what I mean?

475
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:36,390
He's a worker.
Do you train with you?

476
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:41,391
Have the coaches work with you?
Because when you say that you're from 

477
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:41,391
our stable,
that's what I want it to be,

478
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:45,390
you know,
legit roasted you hook up with Henry 

479
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:45,540
Smith.
Um,

480
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,570
do Baltimore man.
We just kind of crossed paths years ago 

481
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,450
and root boy.
I said rude boy.

482
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,420
I wish I had an answer for that,
but I don't.

483
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,420
I don't know.
I don't have,

484
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,550
I don't have like that dude though.
He's a great coach to.

485
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,180
Sure.
Sure.

486
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:57,950
Absolutely.
Um,

487
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:02,951
and smooth in the corner.
Like you can tell a lot about a guy and 

488
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:05,880
how he gives instruction in your corner.
Absolutely calm and smooth.

489
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,800
He's like,
can I please get this?

490
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:08,640
Can I get that?

491
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Thank you very much.
But he also is a very technical is real 

492
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,211
technical and his instruction,
like as a guy who watches a lot of 

493
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:20,631
fights,
nothing drives me crazier than when 

494
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:20,631
someone doesn't have advice,
you know,

495
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:20,631
and they're like,
go get 'em,

496
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:22,690
go kick his ass.
So that'd be like me cornering Leonard.

497
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,740
But for in the quarter,
like that is kind of tactical advice,

498
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,840
you know,
lenders,

499
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:34,600
one of my all time favorite guys to 
watch because God damn it,

500
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,640
you know,
the,

501
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,530
the firefighter,
a dying breed,

502
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,530
you know,
when,

503
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,770
when,
when Linda was at his,

504
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:45,771
you know,
talking about retirement with me and 

505
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:45,771
everything.
He,

506
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:45,771
he's like,
man,

507
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:49,941
I just wish I could get a fight with 
somebody who would just stand there and 

508
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:49,941
fucking throw down with me.
And I'm like,

509
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,420
Leonard Brother,
those days are gone.

510
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,220
These guys that come in and take you 
down.

511
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,700
And he's like,
yeah,

512
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:58,701
but no,
I think this guy gets down with Mike 

513
00:19:58,701 --> 00:19:58,701
now,
Leonard,

514
00:19:58,701 --> 00:19:58,701
he's going to take you down,
you know,

515
00:19:58,701 --> 00:19:58,710
so that we'd have to go back and forth 
that.

516
00:19:58,711 --> 00:19:59,850
Then the kid would take him down,
you know,

517
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,040
because wrestling and practicing 
Breslin.

518
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:03,720
But that's where the sport's going,
you know,

519
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,890
so well the sports going in this method 
that like,

520
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,290
you know,
an order or this,

521
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,880
this place where in order to win you got
to be able to do everything.

522
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,470
It'd be totally unpredictable.
And you,

523
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,640
you've got to be able to fight smart and
not put yourself in danger.

524
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,210
And Leonard was all about just throwing 
himself into danger.

525
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,190
Peeling the stickers off the match with 
the punches.

526
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,020
Yeah.
He would drive from the back of his 

527
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,020
calf.
Loved it.

528
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,020
I mean,
but those are the fights.

529
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,080
I mean the Jens pulver and Lydia Garcia 
if I.

530
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,040
Yeah Man.
Why?

531
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,690
Oh,
Leonard had a bunch of wild ones.

532
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:41,691
So you get a bunch of,
like when it was over you just like 

533
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:41,691
shaking your head like,
God,

534
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:42,490
what did I just see?
So,

535
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,500
uh,
the craziest thing man,

536
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,000
I,
when I had the incident at whole foods,

537
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:50,001
I don't know if you heard about it now 
when I got punched a blender with 

538
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:50,001
somebody,

539
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:50,001
punched you.
What?

540
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,500
In the parking lot or sometimes I'll get
it out now,

541
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,960
you know.
So I'm walking across texting on my 

542
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,970
phone in a guy lays on the horn and my 
girls like,

543
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,590
who is that?
I look up,

544
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:00,370
I don't know.
She said,

545
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:00,970
you don't know him?
I said,

546
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,710
no.
We walked to the car,

547
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,980
the car goes and parks like three spots 
down from the dude gets up.

548
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:07,510
He's like,
what's up motherfucker?

549
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,610
And I was like,
like me,

550
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,080
you're talking to me?
And he's like,

551
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,700
yeah bitch.
And I was like,

552
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,430
okay,
and then just smoke me and my,

553
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,550
I blew my glasses on the floor.
Now mind you,

554
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,390
I'm still in trial for the boat race.
It's thing that's going on the boat.

555
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:24,250
One was you head kicks some dude,
right?

556
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,090
Allegedly some dude got,
I'll get to that story out.

557
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,790
So my girl looked at me and burning 
fucking fire is raging out of my ears,

558
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,090
right?

559
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,790
She goes,
no,

560
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,080
no.
Right.

561
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,810
So I'd tell this dude like anybody 
would.

562
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,570
Today's your lucky day.
The dude's like,

563
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,140
oh yeah,
mother fucker back.

564
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,010
Right?
And then then he hops up again to hit me

565
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:51,460
again.
I said,

566
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:53,800
motherfucker be touched me again.
I'm going to kill you.

567
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,930
Like,
like I can't take two.

568
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,170
I cannot take to Leonard there.
Right?

569
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,140
And so litter goes to hit this dude and 
then he's like,

570
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:06,130
all Bible good doesn't cuss.
And he's like,

571
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,490
frick you,
you know what I mean?

572
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Like he's like,
he's so lucky that guy got so lucky.

573
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:19,210
He probably thinks he's such a bad ass.
And uh,

574
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:24,270
we're in,
we just literally got training done 

575
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,270
training.
So we're in like training gear.

576
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,990
We,
the whole foods gets shit the drink.

577
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,360
So was like,
you want to be a UFC fighter,

578
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,150
what the blah blah blah blah.
Like God man.

579
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,750
So,
uh,

580
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:35,200
and I got my car and drove away and 
don't know who that guy is.

581
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,520
I have no clue.
Whoever you are,

582
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,470
pitch whoever got lucky as fuck.
Alright.

583
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,250
So anyways,
boat,

584
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:43,550
rage,
rage,

585
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,070
boat raised.
What happened?

586
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,700
We're up at Grand Lake.
Reason I go to grand lakes.

587
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,730
It's freezing cold.
No one goes to grand lake to wakeboard 

588
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:53,730
because it's cold,
cold water,

589
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,370
ice,
grand lake,

590
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,550
Colorado up in the mountains.
Fucking super deep,

591
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,590
freezing cold lake.
But the water's beautiful.

592
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,620
Um,
so this guy lived there,

593
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:07,650
he seen my boat and he told the police 
there and he seen us there the week 

594
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,260
before and he called it massaging and 
making load my boat because yeah,

595
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:11,940
as an expensive boat I can take care of 
it,

596
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:13,390
whacked it,
make sure it's clean,

597
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:13,870
you know,
to,

598
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:18,871
you know,
and he's upset that you take care of 

599
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:20,701
your boat.
I guess that's what the police report 

600
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:20,701
said.

601
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:20,701
So he,
um,

602
00:23:20,701 --> 00:23:22,660
my buddy mike fishing off the back of 
his belt,

603
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:24,760
off the back of my boat.
The guy comes in,

604
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,560
EU having fun playing.
He has like a ski do jet ski boat and he

605
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,860
uh,
comes feet away and like sprays water,

606
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,230
have a,
he washes my boat up onto the rocks.

607
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,350
Now I got cody Donovan at the time,
was fighting in the UFC.

608
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,100
I'm in three or four of the nine of us.
There was nine of us.

609
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,490
We were camping out for the weekend and 
uh,

610
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,520
cody's fight rate like,
fuck,

611
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,740
let's go get him.
The girl settle us down.

612
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:49,370
We don't.
Right.

613
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,620
So later on,
about an hour and half later we go out,

614
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:52,790
we'll go wakeboarding.
Well,

615
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,700
with my boat you got to fill the ballast
tanks up so you have to like kind of sit

616
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,060
idle and let the tanks fill.
So while we're sitting there idle and it

617
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:04,061
takes feel he's down in the area.
So we're like sitting there letting the 

618
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:08,901
tanks fill.
He's like flexing his muscles from the 

619
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:09,090
shores and which one are you want 
something bro.

620
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,560
So it gets in his boat and he goes 
flying up next to my belt completely.

621
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,690
Let's go to the steering wheel and runs 
the front of his boat.

622
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,000
His boat just goes pink and hits my 
boat.

623
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,430
And I'm like,
oh my God dude,

624
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,560
what the fuck are you doing?
And he's like,

625
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,630
which one are you?
Pussies wants them shit.

626
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,020
We're like,
what?

627
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,470
So everyone bakers are happening and 
blah blah blah blah.

628
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,880
Anyways,
the dude says,

629
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:39,881
you know what?
Fuck it on the run my boat into your 

630
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:40,310
boat.
He's like wasted drunk chairs off,

631
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,330
flipped a bitch and comes bead lining 
for my boat.

632
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,370
Now had this not been the situation 
we're in,

633
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,700
I would have congratulated this,
do for the most epic fucking water spray

634
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,180
I've ever seen thrown into another 
person's boat because at the last second

635
00:24:56,181 --> 00:25:01,181
he cuts and throws the most massive wave
that just drench is everyone's phone and

636
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,710
just like,
like he hits you like a tidal wave and I

637
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,270
was like,
was fucking pissed.

638
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,270
So I tried boat to the shore and I get 
off the boat and I run about 200 yards 

639
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,570
down the shore trying to get him to come
to me because my girl stood up and she's

640
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:15,440
like,
that's fucking it.

641
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:16,730
And that's all I had to hear when I 
hurt,

642
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:17,930
when she stood up and you know,
she's like,

643
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:19,670
that's it.
That's it.

644
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:20,510
You know what I'm saying?
That was it.

645
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,560
That was it.
That's all I need to know.

646
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,040
Okay.
That's it.

647
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,050
So I tried to get this dude to run to 
me.

648
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,030
He does not.
He comes straight from my girl,

649
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,340
gets off his boat,
pointing his finger at her,

650
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,930
you know.
So I just walked right past step in 

651
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:36,930
front of him and I just front teeth 
stumbling,

652
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,810
like set them down in the sand,
like chill the fuck out.

653
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,610
A lot of crazy gorilla pounding the dude
in the sand is going through my mind.

654
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,330
I don't always trained myself and the 
dude gets up and tries to hit me with 

655
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,050
the old sneaker righthand Oh God,
sorry.

656
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:54,470
I just slipped and I had kicked him 
lightly Gel and I say lightly,

657
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,990
very lightly,
like just like a,

658
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,380
like a boom and sit him down and I'm 
like,

659
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:03,140
motherfucker don't even know what the 
fuck.

660
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:05,990
I said he wouldn't get up,
dude won't get up now.

661
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,870
So I literally sit down right next to 
him like,

662
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:10,850
you fucking,
I don't know what to do and I,

663
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,660
I want to just thrilled.
Just ripped his heart out.

664
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,670
Right?
Or to start backhanded him sitting next 

665
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:20,180
to sitting next to him,
shoulder to shoulder.

666
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,410
Little weird.
What a weird dude.

667
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,150
That's the only thing I can in the fit 
of rage.

668
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,790
I mean I could,
I could think to do that.

669
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,440
So cody grabs me,
knock enough's enough.

670
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,290
And as soon as I do that,
the kid rolls over,

671
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,990
take out his phone and takes a picture 
of me,

672
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,050
take a picture of my boat.
He dials nine slash 11 and I was like,

673
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,360
good call.
I'm on when you fucking idiot.

674
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,090
So the do calls nine slash 11,
call

675
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,760
show up.
I said,

676
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:45,600
yes,
dude's drunk.

677
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,590
He says,
man,

678
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:51,591
I'm only junk because this dude 
embarrassed me in front of all of my 

679
00:26:51,591 --> 00:26:54,831
friends.
So I had to drink to get over what had 

680
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:54,831
just happened.
What?

681
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,000
How'd you embarrass him by cleaning your
boat?

682
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,160
Oh no,
because I had kicked him in front of his

683
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,070
friends.
But that was before that,

684
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:04,260
the massaging.
And so he,

685
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,480
he had a lot of people with them.
Yeah,

686
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,290
like a big camper.
So we go to court,

687
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,800
we filed the second two year process.
I'm going through all the guys that his 

688
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,730
width or are there police statements 
match mine that he'd been.

689
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,280
He was talking about us all day.
Two weeks.

690
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,840
You would chase us down.
He wanted a piece of it.

691
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,990
So I mean it,
it all got dropped and dismissed,

692
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:24,840
but he tried to come up from 50 grand 
and it was just unbelievable.

693
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,090
What's amazing,
how nice you were about it mean the 

694
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,390
front kick to the chest and head kick.
Yeah,

695
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,910
exactly.
Exactly.

696
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,950
And what I just told you,
there is the same story.

697
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:35,860
His people told him,
he said,

698
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:38,370
I'm not exaggerating that didn't I just 
haul off and beat him down?

699
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,100
Which I,
I'm thinking I'm maturing in my,

700
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,420
in my water.
You aren't mature.

701
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:46,500
I am going to tell you that.
It's just amazing how people will try to

702
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:51,501
sue over things like that.
Like that becomes like the lottery to 

703
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:51,900
them.
Do you know the two guys sued?

704
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:56,910
The people always ask that came in.
Can you take a picture choking me like 

705
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,740
the UFC doesn't want anybody choking 
anybody in pictures.

706
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:02,790
I've been told that I tell them no.
And Matt Hughes were both sued.

707
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,970
The Matthew story is kind of hilarious 
because the guy asked Matt he to put 

708
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,040
them in a rear naked choke for picture.

709
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,230
So Matt Hughes does.
And then the guy says,

710
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:15,231
hey look,
I got evidence has got choked me and he 

711
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:15,231
hurt me.
So he tries to sue.

712
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:16,860
Well they do an investigation on the guy
and find out the guy's a cop.

713
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,060
Then they dig deeper and find out he's a
dirty cop and the dude wants up getting 

714
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,530
popped and goes to jail because of that.
And the chocolate Dell one,

715
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,310
I'm pretty sure chuck had to wind up 
paying something like three times,

716
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,140
three times,
three times,

717
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:34,140
three times they've been sued them.
And my neighbor,

718
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:37,690
I'm sued me for what he said that,
um,

719
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,210
my dogs attacked his horse.

720
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,800
Did they know?
Absolutely not.

721
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,800
Some body else's dog did,
but he was a neighbor.

722
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,340
So we said mind to guy just moved in and
his horse ran through the fence.

723
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:55,790
Well,
if you're any kind of a horse owner at 

724
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,531
all,
you can't just move into somewhere and 

725
00:28:58,531 --> 00:28:58,531
take the reins up your horse and let him
go.

726
00:28:58,531 --> 00:28:59,850
We have no idea what the perimeter you 
need.

727
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,440
You need to take your horse out and walk
the perimeter.

728
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,540
He lets his horse,
the horse runs through the fence.

729
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:05,160
He said,
and my dogs chased him to the fence.

730
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Um,
it was cheaper for me just to pay the 

731
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:10,840
guy off than to go to court and fight 
it.

732
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,610
So it's just unbelievable,
man.

733
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,040
That kind of shit drives me fucking 
crazy.

734
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,860
In my old roommate,
me and Leonard Garcia used to live in.

735
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:21,420
We'd have guys come down for training 
camp.

736
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Um,
this lady got as good man after we,

737
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,250
after when I bought this new house,
we moved in.

738
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:34,251
She then claimed students that we were 
subleasing are ran out to our training 

739
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,480
partners was $12,000
out of Bayer.

740
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,350
Why 12,000?
Gives a fuck.

741
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,800
I don't understand it.
She must've been hurting for money.

742
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,480
So she was years old.
She owned the house at one point.

743
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:51,530
Did you ricky?
He used to work for Jackson's Greg 

744
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,870
Jackson's guy.
I probably would if I saw him anyway.

745
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:54,630
So the ladies hurting for money,
right?

746
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,250
She needs to.
She's renting this house,

747
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,720
her house,
the house she's living in.

748
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,420
I get ricky buys her house from her.
I tell her,

749
00:30:00,421 --> 00:30:05,421
hey,
we'll move out now so you can move back 

750
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:05,421
into your house.
Does your foreclosing.

751
00:30:05,421 --> 00:30:06,000
So we,
we make this all work,

752
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,130
right?
I worked with lady I,

753
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:11,460
she's a realtor.
I use her as my realtor to buy my ranch.

754
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,370
That's how fucking crazy this gets,
right?

755
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,660
So I use her or we do this.
Soon as we get the paperwork done,

756
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,220
she turns around and sues us for 
subleasing are ran out.

757
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,430
And my grandma's honestly,
you can vouch for this fucking crazy.

758
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Yeah.
She said that the whole time we were 

759
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,141
there,
we were having people come down to 

760
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:30,141
training.
We're,

761
00:30:30,141 --> 00:30:32,420
we're,
we're renting it out to them and making 

762
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:32,420
money off of her property.
Oh,

763
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,870
two.
And of course I got the notices to go to

764
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,920
court.
Why don't show up to court.

765
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:35,410
So they passed.

766
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,280
Brian could have fought it,
but I did.

767
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:41,950
And I was like,
yeah,

768
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:42,880
whatever.
If you do,

769
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:47,881
that takes forever.
The problem with those things is it's 

770
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:47,881
like these,
uh,

771
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:48,360
blake,
do you know what a patent troll is?

772
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,270
[inaudible] patent trolls are.
They get patents on things.

773
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:55,830
They buy up patents and patents and then
they'll sue like a,

774
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,520
uh,
like a company like apple,

775
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:02,850
like they,
they were going to have to podcasters 

776
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,430
for awhile and what they do is they'll,
they went after Adam Carolla for 

777
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,430
something,
some,

778
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,530
some sort of sort of patent and they 
went after a few other people,

779
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,620
but apple had a wound up paying like 7 
million bucks or something like that 

780
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:13,750
because for apple to,
you know,

781
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:16,930
they have so much fucking money.
It's easier for them to pay off a patent

782
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:21,931
troll than it is to address it in court 
and spent all their resources and you 

783
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,070
know,
they might like the UFC is doing this,

784
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,100
you know,
the antitrust lawsuit that like this is 

785
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,860
going to cost them $100,
million dollars in legal fees.

786
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,060
But it's either that or pay people off.
They'd rather spend the money.

787
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,240
They'd rather pay the legal fees.
Yeah.

788
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,350
Oh,
because principle for them.

789
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,650
Well,
principle and also sets a precedent.

790
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,990
And you,
if you,

791
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,940
if you start paying out then other 
people start coming out of the woodwork.

792
00:31:45,941 --> 00:31:50,941
But what's a weird.
It's a weird world we live in where you 

793
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:52,480
can just sue over shit like that Alpha 
brain.

794
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,580
So brain size.
Good for you.

795
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,880
You got that big ass on it.
Package.

796
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,880
Right?
I love it.

797
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,980
I love the picture you sent of you with 
the balancing.

798
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,830
How'd you do that?
Man with the balance was good.

799
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:08,600
But the whole thing done.
It was,

800
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,990
it was suspended.
Did you pull that off?

801
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,470
Because I'm fucking super athletic.
Alpha.

802
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:19,310
Pam.
Okay.

803
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,170
That's a good answer.

804
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,660
And,
and when we were at elevate,

805
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:28,661
which is a strength conditioning where 
you guys sent a whole bunch of those 

806
00:32:28,661 --> 00:32:28,661
masons too.
And uh,

807
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:33,970
they were like,
you're gonna fucking knock your teeth 

808
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:33,970
down.
And I was like,

809
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:33,970
well then I'll be at toothless 
motherfucker,

810
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:33,970
but let's do this.

811
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,890
You,
you're constantly doing shit like that.

812
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:42,891
Right?
Like suddenly wake board in jumping 

813
00:32:42,891 --> 00:32:43,490
snowmobiles over the top way.
El Nino,

814
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:45,290
baby,
come on,

815
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,970
Colorado is going to be unreal this 
year.

816
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:48,770
I cannot wait.
Everybody's hoping for that.

817
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,810
But I don't know if that's real.
I hope so.

818
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,900
They keep saying that though.
The way the temperature of the water at 

819
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,421
California is like desperate surfing 
with when with nothing this morning and 

820
00:32:58,421 --> 00:32:58,870
it was great.
Warm as fuck.

821
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,630
Warm,
super warm.

822
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:04,650
Yeah.
They have yellowtail they bad yellow 

823
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:04,970
tail all over the coast around Santa 
Monica and Malibu,

824
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:05,560
which is,
you know,

825
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,210
usually you got to go out to fucking 
Hawaii and so uh,

826
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,320
they're pretty excited about it.
People think that this is going to 

827
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,320
change,
but you know,

828
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,310
trying to guess what Mother Nature's 
going to join a few months from now 

829
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,450
because back then you could maybe key in
those words.

830
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
I have no idea.

831
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,900
I don't know either.
I don't know either,

832
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:26,160
but they are damn sure on the damn sure 
on.

833
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:31,161
And what do they use?
What kind of Hocus pocus are they using 

834
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:31,161
to figure that out?
Maybe the Mayan calendar.

835
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,180
That didn't work out though.
We're still here three years later.

836
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,520
Here we are.
I was convinced dude,

837
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:42,320
like way back in 2006.
I was like December 21st 2012.

838
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,560
It's all done.
All done for you on the computer.

839
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:49,520
Junior crash at 2000,
2000 came around.

840
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:51,050
I was hiding,
I stayed at home,

841
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,460
stockpiled water,
the whole deal.

842
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,060
I was listening to art bell,
Start Stock,

843
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,490
stockpiling water has stockpiled food.
I need to do the water guys have a.

844
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:59,780
well you're out.
You're out.

845
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,660
But the problem is the well the well 
suck.

846
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Well it's not that good because it will.
Well in Colorado it was really good for 

847
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,131
you,
but if you have 20 people come to your 

848
00:34:12,131 --> 00:34:12,131
house and take showers.

849
00:34:12,131 --> 00:34:16,990
So yeah,
I had a brand new water heaters and 

850
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:16,990
everything like that.
You gotta well you're out there like are

851
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,490
you on solar?
No,

852
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:23,510
my wish I need to be billing.
So here's like a giant fucking white 

853
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,880
them fucking Christ.
And if some asshole comes and trains at 

854
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,760
my house and forgets to turn the heater 
off from the gym,

855
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,630
$1,500
overnight.

856
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,750
Oh No.
And then I come into the house fucking 

857
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,750
ripping and roaring.
Who the fuck?

858
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,110
And everyone's like wouldn't meet of 
course 1500 bucks.

859
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,250
Propane in the winter.
Right.

860
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,800
And the funny thing is that the propane 
companies like,

861
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,930
oh you don't want to pay.
We want to bring any more profane.

862
00:34:47,931 --> 00:34:49,610
We don't give a shit.
Oh God.

863
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,560
You got to keep warm.
Yeah.

864
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,320
Yeah.
So yeah.

865
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,030
Fuck that dude.
You should have a fireplace in that gym.

866
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,360
Who's going to stoke it today?
You're the,

867
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,050
you're the stocker.

868
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,960
Go split the wood and stock of wood out 
there.

869
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:04,720
Do you have a forest?
A?

870
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,120
No.
No.

871
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:06,990
For us,
we got no CACTI.

872
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,740
Can you cook Cacti?
And a fucking not really.

873
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:14,741
Right?
I wonder if you can get some pot out of 

874
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:14,741
it.
I don't know.

875
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:15,050
You'd have to have because we are.
We.

876
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:18,290
Are we on Pedro?
Is that what it is?

877
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,120
The idea.
But uh,

878
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,430
we're in the,
that's where they do it in young guns.

879
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,110
Oh yeah.
Well not only that,

880
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,660
tent rock where they film.
You're under spare road,

881
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,240
asshole.
That's miles down the road from me.

882
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,510
That is where.
Yeah,

883
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,000
yeah.
That's where they,

884
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,410
you know,
this only that's the only.

885
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,330
We're doing that for the last couple 
hundred years.

886
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,860
Like everybody thinks that that was like
thousands of years old.

887
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,380
No evidence,
no evidence that they were,

888
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:45,381
you.
The native Americans were using 

889
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:45,381
paylocity more than a couple hundred 
years.

890
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:46,000
But um,
ha ha,

891
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,490
okay.
Marijuana Pot.

892
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,980
What do they like?
Let's just smoke this shit up.

893
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,170
How does that,
how does that work?

894
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,330
Who's the Guinea pig on that too?
Good question.

895
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,080
Pod.
Like,

896
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:58,140
oh,
let's just boil some cactus and oops,

897
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,210
now I'm fucking tripping.
So that was cool.

898
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,600
This is real good question.
There's a lot of those things out there 

899
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:05,600
that like how the fuck did they ever 
figure that out?

900
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,030
Like math,
math,

901
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,470
like all battery acid now like,
cool.

902
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:12,190
Let's all grow old medicine.
Oh,

903
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
you meth users out there.
Ix Nay boys.

904
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:16,470
Yucky.
Well there's very good cooks.

905
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:17,250
That's why,
you know,

906
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,740
breaking bad made a lot of sense.
You know,

907
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,200
he needed a real fucking chemist,
chemist.

908
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,870
But uh,
like the Iowasca one is a crazy one.

909
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,970
They've been using that for like 10,000
years.

910
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,370
You gotta take the leaves of one plant 
and.

911
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,330
Yeah.
And they boil it down.

912
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,400
It's a,
it's dmt in a,

913
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,160
in a drinkable form because otherwise 
dmt.

914
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,690
The only way you could take it as you 
have to.

915
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,910
I've experienced him to eat more real 
life.

916
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,130
We want to have an accident.
Uh,

917
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:49,131
when my guts were hanging out of me,
I remember him with your guts sides 

918
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:50,610
where I got this giant scar.
What is the director director?

919
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,070
Four wheeler,
you know,

920
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:55,680
and uh,
broke all my ribs and anyway,

921
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:59,280
that was in the hospital flight,
took the flight for life to the hospital

922
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:02,260
and I remember laying there and laying 
in the garden,

923
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,390
they had me strapped down because I was 
a fucking lunatic and I remember tipping

924
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,430
the Gurney over and I had to throw up 
and I threw up blood all over this poor 

925
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,740
nurse and she did this little weird,
oh God has got blood thrown upon me.

926
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Action.
And then I remembered they sent me back 

927
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,230
up and it was like the most peaceful 
feeling.

928
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,750
Like everything was just okay.
Like no pain.

929
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,030
Fucking dying was okay.
I stupid as that sounds and crazy.

930
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:29,610
Like it was just,
it was just okay.

931
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:32,010
I felt the best I've ever felt in my 
life.

932
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,860
Wow.
It was like supernatural man.

933
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:36,990
It was crazy.
Like I was in so much pain,

934
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:41,991
like,
so I'm in the Goddamn ambulance and 

935
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:45,830
they're taking me and there's a new guy 
in there because my lungs were 

936
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,681
punctured,
so this huge needle and the guy's 

937
00:37:48,681 --> 00:37:51,561
telling the other guy how to fucking 
[inaudible] I guess he punctured her 

938
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:51,561
lung and then your air comes back.
Right.

939
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:54,540
And the guys like walk in the new guy 
through and I was like,

940
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:55,950
fuck no,
like,

941
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,130
I'm like,
I can't really say fuck no.

942
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:00,450
But um,
yeah,

943
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:01,140
I was like,
no,

944
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:05,580
you don't get the new guy today,
not today,

945
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:06,240
motherfucker.

946
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,280
So,
but anyway,

947
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:12,630
fit the Gurney over so much pain and 
they write me back up and everything was

948
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:14,370
just okay.
Like went,

949
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:19,371
like it's crystally blue haze and I woke
up like two weeks later,

950
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:23,910
a strangling,
strangling my grandma two weeks later.

951
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:24,900
So you were in a coma?
Yeah,

952
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,460
well it's like a medical induced.
Yeah.

953
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,690
Wow.
Jeez.

954
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,500
How old were you when this happened?
It was 2006 June,

955
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,310
something in 2006.
My grandmother was fighting in the WEC.

956
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,870
At this time were you.
When did you start fire?

957
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,900
I was nine slash 2009,
so talk about me doing crazy shit that I

958
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,980
probably shouldn't be like it hurt and I
don't want to be able to fight.

959
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,981
I was,
I did this giant kickbox didn't want to 

960
00:38:49,981 --> 00:38:52,651
a world title and I won a spot to go 
fight in front of the King of Thailand 

961
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:56,611
and I was supposed to leave that weekend
that I went out racing motorcross and 

962
00:38:56,611 --> 00:38:56,611
wow.

963
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,560
So Ms Dot that fucking boat,
but a hey,

964
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:04,980
this,
there's not a lot of money and fight 

965
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:04,980
King of Thailand anyway.
No,

966
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,860
but I mean,
so the kid was,

967
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,000
the only reason I got into fighting was 
because a,

968
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,630
I love it was like my favorite thing to 
do in the whole world still is.

969
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,710
But I would just see the world.
They'd call me and I was the guy.

970
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:19,711
They would call you all.
Everyone talks about taking short 

971
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:19,711
notice.
So I was like,

972
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:19,711
Craig Kelby,
you're crazy.

973
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:19,780
Like man,
I used to take fights on three days.

974
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:21,970
Notice I'm taking them a four weeks now 
I'm fucking good.

975
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,620
So they'd call me.
I was their guy.

976
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:25,000
They'd call and be like,
Hey,

977
00:39:25,001 --> 00:39:27,050
we need you in Japan.
Um,

978
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,050
it's Wednesday when you there Saturday.
And I'm like,

979
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:34,150
let's go.
And I'd go and fucking me and my buddy 

980
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,541
Mike Baldwin,
who was like my best friends still to 

981
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:36,541
this day who comes to everyone of my 
fights would get off the plane,

982
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,570
hit Rappongi.

983
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,670
I don't know if he is like,
yeah,

984
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,730
the party.
And I remember sometimes I was so hung 

985
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,061
over for Wayne's that I'm like trying to
drink gatorade and recruit my brain.

986
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,300
Just marketing,
just to weigh in,

987
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,580
just to square up.
Just a waiting areas.

988
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah.
So those,

989
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,060
I mean in fighting,
which is something that I did to pay for

990
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:01,300
my trip to go see the world.
So fun.

991
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,580
Those days where I still,
I still live in today,

992
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,300
you know,
finding me.

993
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,700
People make such a big deal.
And I see like,

994
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,390
like felder's a perfect example man.
He,

995
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,590
they take it so serious.
Fighting is not that serious.

996
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,260
Felder takes it too seriously.
Serious man.

997
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,760
So that's one thing I try and teach 
these guys like,

998
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,260
man you drink beer,
you fucking alcoholic,

999
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,850
you piece of shit.
That's what I hear all the time.

1000
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,870
Yeah.
So what?

1001
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,590
I drink beer.
I love.

1002
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,530
I like to drink beer.
Cool.

1003
00:40:22,531 --> 00:40:23,650
Refreshing.
Budweiser's.

1004
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:27,130
She ain't got that band.
I liked drinking.

1005
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:29,890
I like to have a good time.
But people taste it.

1006
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,080
They quit their life.
Right?

1007
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,830
Weeks.
They're like,

1008
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,460
can't eat that.
Can't do this,

1009
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:36,000
can't go home.
I have this huge fight in mma.

1010
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,600
How is it the biggest fight of your 
life?

1011
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:42,601
I mean,
it's the same like this dos Anjos fight 

1012
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:42,601
coming up January or December 19th.
Orlando,

1013
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:42,910
Florida.
World title.

1014
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,130
Biggest fight of my life.
God Damn Right.

1015
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:50,131
I'm a drink.
Beer and fucking have a good time and 

1016
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:50,131
probably get there 10 days early and go 
wakeboarding and go,

1017
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:51,280
oh my God,
why not?

1018
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:54,250
So you just kinda treat it like it's any
other ordinary life.

1019
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Yeah,
because back in the day when I used to 

1020
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,400
fight,
he'd be on two,

1021
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,400
three days notice I had nothing to worry
about.

1022
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,000
It's just a fight.
But what do you worry about an incident 

1023
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,271
happening?
Like the incident that kept you from 

1024
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:06,271
going and fighting for the King of 
Thailand.

1025
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:06,271
I mean,
that's,

1026
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,280
that's the real,
I mean the big thing is to win the 

1027
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,280
title,
right.

1028
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,950
The most guys when they get to your 
position,

1029
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:17,190
they kind of start playing it safe.
That's the difference between you and a 

1030
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,210
lot of these guys because a lot of guys 
are wild in the beginning,

1031
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,710
but then somewhere along the line they 
start realizing the consequences and the

1032
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:25,990
stakes and they start playing it safe.
Yeah.

1033
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,640
I just start to play it safe kind of 
guy.

1034
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,420
Yeah.
I could go.

1035
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,150
I could go wakeboarding the week of the 
fight and blow my knee out.

1036
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,580
Sure.
I'll probably still with a blown knee,

1037
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,010
just tape that bitch out.
See what's up.

1038
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,510
Just a couple of shots.
Get a couple shots of Jack still getting

1039
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,350
cortisone.

1040
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,410
There's all sorts of shit they can do 
now to sort of help you a little bit.

1041
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,800
Short term blown out knees.
Never a good time.

1042
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,580
No,
no.

1043
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:57,581
I mean I've had a couple blonde needs,
but how many different he had knee 

1044
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:57,860
surgeries other than the stomach?
No,

1045
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,930
no surgeries.
Amazing.

1046
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,490
Yeah.
In fact,

1047
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,030
in front of the,
before the uh,

1048
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,930
my last fight,
I'm,

1049
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:10,260
I supposed to get an Mri on my knees and
I had an MRI of my chest because my 

1050
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,430
fucking ribs are so separated and I made
it very crystal clear to the EFC.

1051
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:18,431
I will go get this MRI,
but regardless of the outcome it comes.

1052
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:20,960
I'm still fighting.
Is that okay with you guys?

1053
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:22,400
And it was long and they said yes.
So I was like,

1054
00:42:22,401 --> 00:42:24,020
fine.
They wanted you to get an Mri.

1055
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,140
You wanted to get a day.
Wanted me to want to do together.

1056
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:31,360
So you were complaining of some pain 
maybe or you're realizing there's 

1057
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,240
something wrong.
Like my chest was super separated,

1058
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:33,890
like I couldn't even take a bridge pop,
pop,

1059
00:42:33,891 --> 00:42:35,920
pop like in my solar plexus.
So uh,

1060
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:41,950
went to Dallas and I went and trained 
with some kids in the gym and the dude 

1061
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,260
through a knee with no Shin Pad and just
crushed me and my solar blacks and like 

1062
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,010
separated it bad.
So like what fight was this for the law?

1063
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,260
Midecky fight.
So real.

1064
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,110
Yeah.
The last fight,

1065
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,190
I am the one who is supposed to be with 
qbe that he pulled out for the third 

1066
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,620
fucking time,
so that guy gets hurt a lot.

1067
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,630
These are all fucked up,
fucked up.

1068
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:02,920
A lot of those guys that are fucking 
cane,

1069
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:08,220
right?
A lot of those fucking guys are super 

1070
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,020
strong mentally.
Just ridiculously aggressive.

1071
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,180
Those guys wind up blowing shit out.

1072
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,740
Like canes blown out his knees,
bone on his shoulder.

1073
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,900
Both shoulders had surgeries on him.
Fuck yeah.

1074
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:20,570
That style of fighting,
especially that intense grappling style,

1075
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:25,650
like you just weighed less injuries and 
kickboxing and then stand up striking 

1076
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,040
like boxing.
How many fucking fights get canceled in 

1077
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,410
boxing?
It's rare as fuck man.

1078
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,410
Fight Mayweather.
He said,

1079
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,380
oh,
I can't pull it.

1080
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:36,020
Yeah,
almost.

1081
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,930
I don't know.
I can't remember a big fight ever.

1082
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I mean it would have to be something 
severe and usually it's like doing 

1083
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,380
during strength and conditioning 
training or something,

1084
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,640
you know,
or running or something maybe.

1085
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,960
But it's very rare that someone pulls 
out of a bar or they'd have to break 

1086
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,270
their hand or something like that,
but it's rare.

1087
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,120
But in MMA,
Goddamn,

1088
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,170
it's common,
it's fuck,

1089
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:59,150
there's so many weird scrambling 
situations that you get involved in,

1090
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:04,151
you know,
within you bring in guys to train with 

1091
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:04,151
and sometimes those guys.

1092
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:08,620
That's the other thing that what you 
just said to bringing in guys to train 

1093
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,501
with man.
I think that is one of the biggest 

1094
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:11,501
mistakes that guys make is that these 
young guys,

1095
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,220
they bring into camp.
They don't even know these guys.

1096
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,220
These guys tried to make a name look at.
Well,

1097
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:17,450
if you brought me in to train with you,
Joe,

1098
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,000
I'm fucking you up,
right?

1099
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:20,820
Yeah.
You want to.

1100
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,210
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna let you beat me down.

1101
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,560
Especially if you're coming into a 
champs gap or has a high level guy who's

1102
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,330
well respected.
They want to say,

1103
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,800
dude,
Donald Cerrone came into blah blah,

1104
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,060
blahs

1105
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,960
camp and fucked him up.
Oh Shit.

1106
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:34,830
Really?
I mean,

1107
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:36,120
that's what happens.
So you need to,

1108
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,160
you got to have your friends.
He had friends.

1109
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,190
A lot of guys do it the right way,
like what you're doing at the bad 

1110
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,860
motherfucker ranch.
All those guys are family,

1111
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,310
right?
Yeah,

1112
00:44:44,311 --> 00:44:49,311
absolutely.
And speaking of family like failed or 

1113
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:49,311
people are like,
Kelly,

1114
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:50,460
you want him to lose like the fuck I do 
what his,

1115
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:52,760
him losing due to me.
You can't respond to those people.

1116
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,230
You can't get.
I live at six comma line,

1117
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,020
Edwin New Mexico and you motherfuckers 
won't come.

1118
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,960
You can't get it.
What that is,

1119
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:06,020
you're opening yourself up to the 
retards of the God and you know you got 

1120
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:11,181
your standard.
You're talking about the people that 

1121
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:12,471
comment on a youtube video.
I feel the same dumb shit to me.

1122
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:18,110
I'm like,
you are a youtube where they could be 

1123
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:18,110
children.

1124
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:20,040
It could be young,
young kids or could be morons supposed a

1125
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:21,960
picture of something like surfing and 
people are like,

1126
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,350
Connor's going to kill you.
Well Bitch,

1127
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,360
first of all he's okay.
I want to just get on there and say all 

1128
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:34,491
kinds of shit.
And it's just like you got to pick who 

1129
00:45:34,491 --> 00:45:38,271
you communicate with.
Like say look like you and I know each 

1130
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:38,271
other.
This Jamie,

1131
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:39,060
Jamie,
he's a good dude.

1132
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,650
You want to have a conversation with 
Jamie?

1133
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,350
He's not going to say anything retarded,
but he's right there in front of you.

1134
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:43,980
Now,
if,

1135
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,450
if we were just random people talking 
around,

1136
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,530
you never know.
You might run into a good dude like 

1137
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:53,751
Jamie or you might run into some 
complete fucking idiot that you would 

1138
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,920
never talk to him in real life.
But in text they all look the same.

1139
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,150
They all look the same.

1140
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,510
It all looks the same,
but God can say some shit in a full 

1141
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,120
sentence and you know,
and pretend that he has a point.

1142
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,170
God dammit.
I'm gonna.

1143
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:06,970
Start drinking too.
All we're gonna have to.

1144
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:08,970
You're getting fired.
Are you?

1145
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:10,800
Uh,
are you cracking open a nice cold,

1146
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,040
refreshing budweiser?
I am Donald American Budweiser.

1147
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,580
I just don't,
I just don't think it's wise to 

1148
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:19,920
communicate with people that are just 
insulting online.

1149
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:21,450
I don't,
I don't ever go back and forth.

1150
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I used to.
Why do you drink that fucking piss 

1151
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,690
water?
Disgusting beer comments.

1152
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:30,240
I get some bad.
Budweiser is not bad.

1153
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,060
And then I reached back and like,
Oh yeah,

1154
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,140
they pay me to drink that fucking ice 
cold bud.

1155
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:37,590
Budweiser.
I love it.

1156
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:39,900
I like all kinds of different.
We used to be a bud light guy,

1157
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,960
but now I'm more of a bud heavy guy,
but I like a Sam Adams.

1158
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,520
I like a Guinness.
I like a dark beer,

1159
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:52,521
but I like a budweiser to.
It's like I like water and occasionally 

1160
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:55,941
I like whiskey.
So you're talking about start begging 

1161
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:58,580
her to snakebite snakebite.
Snakebite is genis half Gannis and then 

1162
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,770
half an apple like apple lager.
Oh really?

1163
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:03,490
Oh,
snakebite maybe.

1164
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,340
No.
What's that shit that we drank?

1165
00:47:05,341 --> 00:47:07,740
Black butte porter.
That shit's good.

1166
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,220
Good.
There's dark beer.

1167
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:11,490
This dark black.
Who makes that black butte?

1168
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,560
Who's the company?
That makes sense.

1169
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,680
Google.
Yeah.

1170
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,040
Yeah,
yeah.

1171
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,370
Does shoots brewery.
How awesome is Google now?

1172
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,990
Because no one can bullshit.
You could have told me 20 years ago,

1173
00:47:21,991 --> 00:47:23,270
a year,
the best restaurant in the world.

1174
00:47:23,271 --> 00:47:23,790
I'd be like,
Oh,

1175
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:26,670
you are?
I know you won state seven times.

1176
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,620
Wrote and took worlds.
Whoa.

1177
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,990
How many artists?
Uh,

1178
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,430
no you didn't.
No,

1179
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,520
you didn't actually.
You've never been wrestled.

1180
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,950
How many martial arts guys were like 
that though?

1181
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,890
All the one that wore the recto rex 
condo.

1182
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:46,891
Fucking bad ass pants doing mag flag 
American flag pants and shit.

1183
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,510
Yeah,
it used to be,

1184
00:47:52,511 --> 00:47:54,980
there was a bunch of guys that claim to 
be in.

1185
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,120
Do you ever know who Rafael Torres.
You ever hear about that guy who was a 

1186
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,760
guy who was a writer for um,
like one of those online magazines?

1187
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:07,110
Uh,
I think Abu Dhabi news hired him and uh,

1188
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,020
he turned out to be a fake black belt 
and wound up killing the guy.

1189
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,680
Won them killing like he was dating a 
girl and she was married.

1190
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:16,390
Some dude killed a dude for the 
insurance.

1191
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:18,100
Money got busted the whole deal 
craziness,

1192
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:23,101
right in jail now for murder.
But before that he was claiming to be a 

1193
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:24,940
black belt,
but he set off a bunch of alarms.

1194
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:30,100
Would go off to Thailand to have these 
fucking no holds barred fights and come 

1195
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,191
back and yeah,
I got them into twister in the first 

1196
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:33,191
round.
Everybody was like,

1197
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:34,760
you just learned that like last week,
like it was,

1198
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,840
it was real weird.
But one of the things he did that was 

1199
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:39,840
hilarious is this dude claim to be in a,
a.

1200
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,450
no rules Kuma Tay in the woods.
So he had his friend drop him off.

1201
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,410
He brought a big ass duffle bag.
Right,

1202
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,740
right.
As big he had his friend drop him off.

1203
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,480
He was like,
drop me off and come back again.

1204
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:50,620
Get me a couple of days.
Right.

1205
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,860
So his friend dropped him off.
He goes off into the woods and it 

1206
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:55,860
shrank.
Comes back in a couple days now he's got

1207
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,310
a trophy.
No more,

1208
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:02,370
no more fucking duffle bag with two 
trophies and same size as the duffle 

1209
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:07,321
bag.
Dude comes back without a scratch on 

1210
00:49:07,321 --> 00:49:07,321
him.
The camping gear.

1211
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,880
I mean,
but that's the kind of shit that people 

1212
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:12,880
did.
You know,

1213
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,240
they,
they were people who were retarded.

1214
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:18,241
They really would pretend that they were
involved in these no holds barred 

1215
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:19,500
contests.
And there were 150.

1216
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,520
You know,
I remember the early days like Hixon 

1217
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,211
gracie there would say 400 and oh sure.
Well you mentioned if you had 400 

1218
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:27,640
fucking fights.
God Damn.

1219
00:49:27,641 --> 00:49:32,641
You got to fight a lot.
You have to find like every couple of 

1220
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:36,061
days for years.
And it sounded like my high school days,

1221
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,860
you'd have to win all of them too.
That I did.

1222
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,130
Not that I did not.
Yeah.

1223
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:47,131
Well those are important.
Loses the losses are some of the most 

1224
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:47,131
important ones.
Right?

1225
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:50,881
Those are the ones that really make you 
get back and fucking dig in that burn 

1226
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:52,620
you burn yourself.
Yeah,

1227
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,070
absolutely.
Absolutely.

1228
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,070
Absolutely.
To this day,

1229
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:02,130
are there any losses that,
that just fucking that when you get up 

1230
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,551
in the morning,
you think about that one and it makes 

1231
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:06,370
you just want to go run and you know,
more or less.

1232
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,990
The guys that talked about the Diaz 
fight,

1233
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,550
tell me all the time of day will beat 
your ass at the nic.

1234
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,940
The Diaz brothers have the most 
incredible following,

1235
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:20,970
almost almost as credible as the conor 
mcgregor following the colts is 

1236
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:21,970
unbelievable.
So they,

1237
00:50:21,971 --> 00:50:23,320
uh,
they was telling me all the time,

1238
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,220
you beat your ass again.
Like,

1239
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,080
all right,
well bring his ass on [inaudible].

1240
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,090
I'm ready.
Whatever.

1241
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,940
What?
You fought nate,

1242
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,030
right?
And the Nate Diaz fight like it seemed 

1243
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,030
like you having a hard time in the first
round.

1244
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,510
Like you had a hard time getting 
started.

1245
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,680
Like that was a fight where like,
that dude talked to a lot of shit to 

1246
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:40,680
you,
your boy.

1247
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,170
And it seemed as he.
Is he contacting you?

1248
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,920
He just said he's still there.
I told him come crashed his mother.

1249
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:45,500
Fuck.
Ah,

1250
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:46,510
where is he?
I don't know.

1251
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,290
Oh,
he's texted you right now.

1252
00:50:48,790 --> 00:50:50,290
Um,
yeah.

1253
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,390
I was like,
you were asking me.

1254
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,380
He got in my head and you got me.
Yeah,

1255
00:50:54,381 --> 00:50:56,060
absolutely.
And that shit doesn't happen anymore.

1256
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:01,070
No.
And everyone tells me kronars in your 

1257
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,070
head.
Dishonesty.

1258
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:01,490
So that was a lesson for you.
Super Lesson man.

1259
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:01,910
Yeah,
don't,

1260
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:03,350
don't you mean.
So let's,

1261
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,450
let's take it back.
You're talking about rex Condo,

1262
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:06,260
this guy,
right?

1263
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:11,350
Oh,
you see all the movies that people say 

1264
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:11,350
don't fight out of anger.

1265
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:11,350
I say that for a reason.
I mean,

1266
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,270
so when I got out of anger,
I mean that's,

1267
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,560
I was just,
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

1268
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:18,980
I was just sucked that night and that's 
all there is to no excuses.

1269
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,500
The motherfucker beat me to just get 
caught up in it,

1270
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,670
up in the emotions of all the shitty 
talking.

1271
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:30,671
He knocked your fucking hat of God.
How dare he can talk some shit.

1272
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,720
I'll tell you what you know.
But I as much as he talked,

1273
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,070
I,
I like,

1274
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,720
like those guys.
I like them too.

1275
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,020
I really do.
I mean because there is no front on them

1276
00:51:42,021 --> 00:51:47,021
at all.
They are what you see is what you would 

1277
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:47,630
like if I were to run into the Diaz 
brothers out in the street.

1278
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:50,060
We're fucking throwing down and there's 
no question.

1279
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:51,530
I mean that's just who they are.

1280
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,370
I mean they're,
you know,

1281
00:51:52,371 --> 00:51:55,570
so it's not like they put on this front,
this persona that they're big tub.

1282
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,260
No,
that's who they are.

1283
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,430
Twenty four slash 24 slash seven and 
yeah,

1284
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,620
it's awesome to me.
You know,

1285
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,660
I think both of them I got nothing but 
respect for both.

1286
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,680
So when you guys were all retired or 
you'll have a drink together and have a 

1287
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,010
drink with them now I don't have any.
I don't have any animosity or any anger 

1288
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,280
or hate towards either one of them.
I would definitely hang out with both of

1289
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:13,700
them,
you know,

1290
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,370
and it sucks that fucking,
you know,

1291
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:20,390
nick is in trouble with this whole 
marijuana thing and it was awful.

1292
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:25,810
It's awful.
And it just shows how bad the Nevada 

1293
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,541
state athletic commission is.
And they were angry because he took the 

1294
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:31,391
fifth because he didn't want it.
The fucking guy passed two World Anti 

1295
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,840
Doping Agency tests to test are blood 
tests that way.

1296
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,900
More accurate than the fucking urine 
test that Nevada state athletic 

1297
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,110
commission gave him with Quest 
Diagnostics,

1298
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,180
you know,
and nothing against quest diagnostics.

1299
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:47,240
But that method of testing is not as 
accurate.

1300
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,810
Right.
So the dude was within the realm.

1301
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:55,811
I mean he was,
he was legally passed and they try to 

1302
00:52:55,811 --> 00:52:58,151
stay.
They're stealing money from them and 

1303
00:52:58,151 --> 00:52:59,681
they suspended him for five years.
There are fucking kangaroo court that's 

1304
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:00,890
five years.
Ridiculous.

1305
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,130
At any job.
I mean if I said,

1306
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:05,720
Joe,
you're off the air for five years,

1307
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,840
you're fucking ruined man.
That's five years irrelevant after 

1308
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,530
almost a year.
And if you're not,

1309
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:13,720
I mean he,
he,

1310
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:17,090
he is one of the names in the sport.
Absolutely.

1311
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:21,110
But I mean five years he's getting older
and he's like 33 or 34.

1312
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,370
How old is nick now?
Hold on.

1313
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,830
I want to say he's 32 at least.
Right?

1314
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,160
So five

1315
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,160
years.
He's fucking 37 and he's not doing any 

1316
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,160
trt.
He's not doing shit,

1317
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,520
man.
God bless him.

1318
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,020
He's 32.
Yeah,

1319
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:36,990
it was right.
So five years from now it's over man.

1320
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,910
When we were kids,
when a boxer like hit his thirties,

1321
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:42,690
you're like,
ah,

1322
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,000
he's 32,
33 is almost over.

1323
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,540
We knew it was almost over.
Sure.

1324
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,910
But then the age of trt came along,
especially with mma,

1325
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,810
things got real weird.
Sure.

1326
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,440
Things got real strange.
Like you started to see guys like 36,

1327
00:53:55,441 --> 00:54:00,441
37,
like vito or having a fucking fights of 

1328
00:54:00,441 --> 00:54:00,441
his career,
the best fights ever.

1329
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,390
You know.
And these guys,

1330
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,480
the Diaz brothers,
one thing you've got to say about them 

1331
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:08,910
as these fucking dudes take care of 
their bodies.

1332
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,400
Yes,
they eat healthiest.

1333
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,800
Fuck.
Nick's always eating all organic food.

1334
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,770
He eats really healthy.
He's constantly shaped constantly.

1335
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:19,280
When if this guy is smoking pot,
he,

1336
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,330
he's not,
he's not doing meth.

1337
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,490
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

1338
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,930
I mean,
he's taking care of his body.

1339
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,450
It,
it's not like he's doing steroids.

1340
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,600
It's not like he's doing something 
that's making them freakishly fast or 

1341
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,600
ridiculously strong.
It's actually the complete opposite.

1342
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,810
It's the whole thing is it's so 
frustrating,

1343
00:54:36,811 --> 00:54:41,811
man,
that these clowns have any power over 

1344
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,180
people like you.
It drives me crazy.

1345
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:47,360
It drives me crazy that people like you 
need these fools that have never been 

1346
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,020
punched in the face.
They've never been strangled.

1347
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:54,140
They'd never fought a day in their life.
And they're the ones that get to decide 

1348
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:54,720
what happens to you.
Well,

1349
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:59,721
they're the ones who get to tell Nick 
Diaz he has to sit out for five years 

1350
00:54:59,721 --> 00:55:00,750
and they have the pencil pushers of 
American man.

1351
00:55:00,751 --> 00:55:04,260
They're the people that in high school 
didn't,

1352
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,750
you know,
I feel like those are,

1353
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:09,070
those are the guys that now they have 
something to prove now.

1354
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,580
Now he's high and mighty,
you know,

1355
00:55:12,581 --> 00:55:13,660
and maybe you know,
but,

1356
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:15,730
but there's a lot of pencil pushers that
are good dudes,

1357
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,020
you know,
it's a good women.

1358
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,200
It's not the problem.
The problem is people in positions of 

1359
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:22,960
power that are accustomed to that 
position of power and then they treat it

1360
00:55:22,961 --> 00:55:26,140
like a fucking king or a queen.
They're tyrants.

1361
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,440
That's my buddy Scott Parker.
Was it parked from the avalanche that 

1362
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,300
he's been over 400 fights.
He just actually ran the dairy dairy.

1363
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,750
You marks.
Is that the,

1364
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,800
uh,
the forest.

1365
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,950
The forest actually you have four sides 
because those guys will fight all the 

1366
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:43,950
time,
right?

1367
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:44,860
He'll probably like two,
three times a week.

1368
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,690
That's huge.
He's,

1369
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,700
he's my snowmobile and partner.
Right?

1370
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:53,701
So we,
that's what I'm saying is El Ninos and 

1371
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:53,701
pump.

1372
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:53,701
So I don't know if you've ever ridden a 
snowmobile,

1373
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:57,040
but you get stuck in like five,
six feet of power and now you're stuck.

1374
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,330
A big assemblage come over one hand by 
Rad just written me out,

1375
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:05,331
like go get it.
And I'm in there digging me out like an 

1376
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:05,331
hour.
And then I'm like,

1377
00:56:05,331 --> 00:56:06,520
mother fucking big ass bitch show.
Yeah.

1378
00:56:06,521 --> 00:56:08,110
He's a good dude.
Came down,

1379
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:11,080
helped me build the fucking ranch,
managed solid guy solids as it gets.

1380
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,310
That's nice man.
It's good to have good friends.

1381
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:18,311
Yes.
Especially ones that can lift a fucking 

1382
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,280
snowmobiling rack,
pull it out of the world of professional

1383
00:56:22,481 --> 00:56:24,010
athletes is short that

1384
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,990
it's even more frustrating when someone 
gets.

1385
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,240
Like,
if you're an accountant and they suspend

1386
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,470
you for five years,
you know,

1387
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:34,471
hey,
you could always get a job doing 

1388
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:35,791
something else.
Then five years from now you get 

1389
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:37,531
reinstated as an accountant.
But when you're an athlete you got this 

1390
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:37,531
short window.
I mean,

1391
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:38,950
I think nick started fight when he was 
18,

1392
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:44,730
so he's 32 now.
He's got a few years left at Max.

1393
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,690
Yeah,
Max Max.

1394
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:53,170
I mean it's conceivable that he could 
come back at 37 since he does take care 

1395
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,031
of his body.
Maybe it's maybe it's a very tough 

1396
00:56:57,031 --> 00:56:57,670
financially.
What are you doing right?

1397
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,250
You're accustomed to a lifestyle in 
fighting.

1398
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,780
I am at least.
Yeah,

1399
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,480
sure.
I'm a super degenerative my money.

1400
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:05,990
Everyone knows.
That's not mean.

1401
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,650
What if I were to,
if something happened to me today,

1402
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,860
I don't know what would do.
You would have to go on the road and 

1403
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,901
started doing seminars,
but euro because of your style and 

1404
00:57:15,901 --> 00:57:17,290
because of Nick's style,
you guys are both really well loved.

1405
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,850
Like if something like that happened 
with you,

1406
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:21,910
you could go do seminars and make a few 
grand every week and maybe,

1407
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,580
maybe not in Dublin.
How not to go anywhere.

1408
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,480
Thought you could do it.
If you and connor fought and duked it 

1409
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,610
out,
had an epic contest,

1410
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:32,050
then you could do it.
You know,

1411
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:37,100
I'm just a big stick in the more.
If you beat them a couple times 

1412
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,650
decisively,
you'd have to beat them to where they 

1413
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:40,650
have to just give in.
They'd have to say,

1414
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:40,650
all right,
you had to beat them,

1415
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,620
beat them.
But if you're fucking cut down to 1:45,

1416
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,580
you torture them.
Fucking connor example.

1417
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,320
Man.
I appreciate the fuck out of.

1418
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:52,930
Look at that guy's doing.
He's getting eyes on the sport.

1419
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,630
Yeah,
he really pisses me up.

1420
00:57:55,631 --> 00:57:57,760
I feel like just tell him when he was in
the fucking president,

1421
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,260
but I wanted to rip him so bad.

1422
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,670
Of course.
Wanted to kill my own bag.

1423
00:58:00,671 --> 00:58:02,830
You know a car and you can blow me like 
a cup of hot soup.

1424
00:58:02,831 --> 00:58:05,500
You son of a bitch but me like a cup of 
hot soup.

1425
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,010
You blow on a cup of hot soup.
Is that what it is?

1426
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,140
Yeah.
Okay.

1427
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,430
Don't.
But if he just blows you like that,

1428
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,570
that's why it's confusing.
The vernacular is really odd.

1429
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,840
Like blow jobs.
I don't understand where that blow me 

1430
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,190
like a couple hot soup first time.
First Time.

1431
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:26,230
There you go.
I've never heard that one before.

1432
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:31,231
I've been around.
That's bought.

1433
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,650
But the fucking guy.
Look what he said to dos Anjos.

1434
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,400
That shit was hilarious.
Like,

1435
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:37,120
you know,
he's like,

1436
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:41,410
if you get a fight with me,
you have made it to your wife honey.

1437
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,990
Put It on the fucking red panties.
We made it.

1438
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,550
Come on.
I,

1439
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,630
I appreciate the fucker.

1440
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,630
That shit.
His shit talking game is better than 

1441
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:51,630
anybody.
It is.

1442
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:51,630
He's the best ever.
Yeah,

1443
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:56,020
I mean and Nick Diaz is right because 
you know like what his anc antics inside

1444
00:58:56,141 --> 00:59:01,141
the octagon.
Nick's antics inside the octagon fuck 

1445
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:01,141
would a lot of people's heads.
Sure.

1446
00:59:01,141 --> 00:59:04,630
Like the first fight with Robbie lawler.
Like I remember there was a first time I

1447
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,570
ever saw nick talk shit.
It was the first fight with brock.

1448
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:08,110
He logs Robbie.
It was dangerous.

1449
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:13,260
So Nick,
Nick took that shit talking to def con 

1450
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,580
five and he got into the octagon and the
first thing he does,

1451
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:20,581
he gets into the octagon.
He looks over at robby goes stockton 

1452
00:59:20,581 --> 00:59:22,490
motherfucker stockton and he starts 
walking around Stockton Mother and rob.

1453
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,250
He's like,
what the fuck is he talking about?

1454
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,040
That even mean?
Yeah.

1455
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,790
Then the entire time the fight is going 
on like,

1456
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,120
what?

1457
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,530
Bitch,
what you gonna do Bitch,

1458
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,330
what you gonna do Bitch.
And it hit them all.

1459
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,560
Bitch,
I just stung you bitch.

1460
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:38,740
And it'd be popping them and every time 
robby lawler didn't talk back to them 

1461
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,300
but you could clearly see he's not,
he didn't anticipate that,

1462
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,970
but I don't.
As far as nick and nate go,

1463
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:49,030
I don't know if that's like a game plan 
that there that's just like them.

1464
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,100
Like I think if they were on the street 
they'd be like,

1465
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:56,180
whoa.
Like that's like real life talk like 

1466
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:56,180
that,
what they know.

1467
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,340
But it's still a bit like that.
That's,

1468
00:59:57,410 --> 00:59:58,400
that's,
that's them,

1469
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,460
that's them.
You know what I'm saying is still a 

1470
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,160
psychological think.
It's an excellent tactic.

1471
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:05,690
And,
and do you think silver?

1472
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,020
It fucked Anderson Silva's head up dude.
Somebody laid out on the mat.

1473
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:09,970
Yeah.
He laid down,

1474
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,700
got a and get a nap in the greatest 
pound for pound fighter in the history 

1475
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:23,351
of the sport and he lays down and then 
he gets up with his hands out like what 

1476
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:23,351
bitch,
what pitched fucking.

1477
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,060
And he didn't do any of that leading up 
to the fight,

1478
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:29,840
which was even more fucked up because I 
don't think Anderson expected it at all.

1479
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,090
And then when he was in there talking 
shit to him,

1480
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:37,010
you could see Anderson just like moving 
around and not doing anything frozen.

1481
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,480
And you know,
thinking about like,

1482
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:43,490
look,
bitch and Anderson had never experienced

1483
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:44,660
that before.
Man,

1484
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:50,100
come did he is Anderson is the,
the greatest psychological fall I've 

1485
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:56,110
ever seen in my career to witness him go
from the guy who beat Stephan Bonner who

1486
01:00:57,231 --> 01:00:59,630
steps his back up against the cage,
drops his hands,

1487
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,170
was like,
come on,

1488
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:02,870
go ahead and then moves out of the way 
and then decides,

1489
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:03,950
all right,
now I'm gonna attack,

1490
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,570
hits bonded with the need of the 
stomach,

1491
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:07,870
drops out and then pound them out and 
Tkos.

1492
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:12,900
Um,
and then it looks like a guy in the 

1493
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:12,900
fucking matrix.

1494
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,850
I mean.
And then to go from that confidence to 

1495
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:16,130
the two Weidman fights,
man,

1496
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:21,131
they did a number on him.
They did a number on him like I'd never 

1497
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:21,131
seen before.
It's,

1498
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:25,810
it's fascinating to see.
It's fascinating to see how a guy could 

1499
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,650
be almost just unbeatable.
And then Weidman,

1500
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,490
after the second fight,
I mean,

1501
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,040
you gotta think about the second fight.
Anderson broke his leg,

1502
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,820
right?
Sure did.

1503
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,860
Well Weidman didn't knock him out.
He broke his leg and he had him hurt bad

1504
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,740
first round.
But then after that fight,

1505
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,180
Wyden was like,
you know what,

1506
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:39,800
I don't want to find them again.
I want to hurt him.

1507
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:41,430
Like,
Whoa,

1508
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,320
just for Anderson to hear that.
It's got to be like,

1509
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,930
that's a mind fuck man playing.
I mean you're coming up.

1510
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:53,050
I mean the mind is such a motherfucker.
Like if you could just get your mind to 

1511
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:56,480
do what your heart wants to do,
life will be so much easier.

1512
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,390
I think there are so many times I'm in 
the cage.

1513
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:07,900
Right.
And I don't know if my brain knew what 

1514
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,200
my heart was trying to say,
but that's what I wanted to do.

1515
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:13,640
You know?
And it's so and then you fuck bro.

1516
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,200
I can't even put words on it,
you know?

1517
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:17,420
It's crazy.
Do you do any mental training?

1518
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:20,030
Do you do any meditating or any 
visualization?

1519
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,470
Fucking ice cold budweiser rather than 
talking about,

1520
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,830
God dammit,
fucking fight is a fight.

1521
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:27,390
But I probably maybe should.
I mean,

1522
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,300
but it's,
it's in this sport.

1523
01:02:30,301 --> 01:02:30,880
It's not like.
Gotcha.

1524
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:31,980
I was telling him,
Blake Griffin Day like,

1525
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,320
hey man,
you have a bad day.

1526
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,290
You fall back,
let your team pick up slack.

1527
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,030
If I have a bad day on the worst fighter
in the world,

1528
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:42,990
my twitter feed is just nothing but you 
pussy fucking die.

1529
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:48,380
Well,
there's a difference between a guy 

1530
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:48,380
losing a basketball game two and getting
shit on by fans.

1531
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,740
All you have to stay offline for a 
couple of days.

1532
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:55,060
You know when you hit that three pointer
to win the game and you're a fucking 

1533
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,060
hero again,
back to your backup.

1534
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:59,780
But for a fighter man,
especially because fighting like when a 

1535
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,760
kid or especially an idiot looks at a 
fighter,

1536
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:05,730
they look at something that is so 
unattainable,

1537
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:07,800
they might as well be talking to a 
Unicorn,

1538
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:12,970
you know,
they might as well have been talking to 

1539
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:12,970
a god.

1540
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,380
They might as well be talking to someone
who's not even real so they feel like 

1541
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,860
they can talk shit to you.
Did you say God and something real like 

1542
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:21,120
you're not even say since I like it.
Yeah,

1543
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:23,380
that's what I'm saying.
You know like your,

1544
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:26,700
your Apollo and Zeus or something.
You know what I'm saying?

1545
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,360
Because like you,
you,

1546
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,560
you are not,
they don't relate to you.

1547
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,570
And when the rightness thing,
they're sitting there,

1548
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:35,430
they're fucking keyboard getting crazy,
man.

1549
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,620
I don't know.
What I just did was I think I might have

1550
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:42,621
deleted something.
I mean the crazy thing about fighting is

1551
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:45,420
if you and I were to go out and fight 
right now,

1552
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,340
there's no emotion.
There's no thought.

1553
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:49,980
It's just fucking get it right.
But now December 18th,

1554
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:52,950
I have this big tondo to think the 
problem.

1555
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,050
It's not the fight that bothers me.

1556
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,290
Nothing at all.
And I think I speak for all fighters.

1557
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,100
I don't know.
I don't give a shit,

1558
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,860
but it's,
I got my grandma's sitting ringside,

1559
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:05,300
I got all the people I meet along the 
way that you know,

1560
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:10,310
I've met and I've interacted with and 
hung out and in their mind when they 

1561
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:10,310
talk to people like,
Oh yeah,

1562
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:10,800
I'm going to,
cal was fight.

1563
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,680
He going to fuck this dude up.
And I'm like,

1564
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,540
you know what I mean?
So,

1565
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:18,600
so like the precedent is so high,
like we need the pressure.

1566
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:23,830
Unbelievable.
So He's talked to those people leading 

1567
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:23,940
up to that fight.
You know what you should do.

1568
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,710
I don't even know if it's,
if it's talking to them over,

1569
01:04:25,711 --> 01:04:30,711
it's just knowing they're there,
knowing that they're there and knowing 

1570
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:30,711
that there.
I mean,

1571
01:04:30,711 --> 01:04:34,500
if the pressure is unbelievable.
So when you're in that fight and they're

1572
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:35,220
like,
are you ready,

1573
01:04:35,221 --> 01:04:35,850
are you ready?

1574
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,560
And sometimes you're like,
fuck no,

1575
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:41,780
I'm not kidding.
No,

1576
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:46,970
I'm not ready.
It is never going to be a time when I'm 

1577
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:46,970
ready for this.
Oh No,

1578
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:46,970
no,
I'm not sweating.

1579
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,860
I'm hooking my heart's pounding in my 
chest and,

1580
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:51,360
and they're like being and you're like,
oh shit.

1581
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:53,510
Fake it till you make it and it's time 
to,

1582
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:53,830
to,
to,

1583
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,580
you know,
it's unbelievable man.

1584
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,960
And you gotta go out there and is he 
ready?

1585
01:04:58,020 --> 01:04:59,520
So that I need to look across to him and
he's like,

1586
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,620
he doesn't look ready.
He hit me.

1587
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,860
You know what I mean?
Like it's some nights and some of those 

1588
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:07,410
times when you're sitting in the corner 
and look across and you're like,

1589
01:05:07,411 --> 01:05:09,120
second got him,
check,

1590
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:10,440
I could see it.
I broke him.

1591
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,320
Got It.
Sometimes you will crush.

1592
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:13,320
He's like,
I don't know.

1593
01:05:13,321 --> 01:05:18,321
What is this dude going to come out 
really hard and it hurt like it's 

1594
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:18,321
[inaudible] so crazy.

1595
01:05:18,321 --> 01:05:19,990
Like the Eddie Alvarez fight,
third round come out.

1596
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:20,740
He came out.
I was like,

1597
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,180
Whoa,
Whoa,

1598
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,540
whoa.
Hey Man.

1599
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,410
Hey Man.
Hey Man.

1600
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:24,320
Slow down.
You know what I mean?

1601
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:24,760
Like,
so it's,

1602
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:25,470
it's,
it's,

1603
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,730
there's so much mind shit that goes on.
Like I said,

1604
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:30,100
I can get my fucking mind do what my 
heart wants to do.

1605
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:31,780
I feel like it can be anyone in the 
world,

1606
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:34,870
but the problem is,
is being ready on game day.

1607
01:05:34,871 --> 01:05:36,370
Man.
It's so tough.

1608
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,550
But listen to me.
Why don't you do any mental preparation.

1609
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:44,551
I tried.
I tried to meet the mental people that 

1610
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:44,551
don't fucking do it and that's all Hokey
pokey.

1611
01:05:44,551 --> 01:05:47,860
Fucking turn yourself around your cell 
phone.

1612
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:54,100
You know,
I feel the mental game is so hard to 

1613
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,121
grasp because yeah,
Henry Smith and Jafari or calling out 

1614
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:57,240
what I should do,
right?

1615
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:59,000
I see what I should do.
Right?

1616
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,420
If I don't do it,
you just like frozen,

1617
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:05,860
like a stick in the mud.
But do you think that like,

1618
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:07,260
okay,
like when you,

1619
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,740
when you're in the heart of battle.
Okay.

1620
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:10,900
Let me ask you this.
When you're at your best,

1621
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,260
like,
like let's say a particularly impressive

1622
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,360
fight like the Jim Miller,
Jim Miller fight,

1623
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:18,370
you were on fire.
You just look,

1624
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,030
you look so dominant in that fight and 
you look so focused and you just,

1625
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,100
your combinations,
you're distancing.

1626
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:26,470
Everything was on point when you're in 
that zone,

1627
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:31,471
right?
When you like right before you stopped 

1628
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:31,471
him,
what,

1629
01:06:31,471 --> 01:06:32,170
what is in your mind?
Are you empty or you blank?

1630
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:35,380
I'm going to be a fucking thousand 
percent honest with you.

1631
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,470
I'm like a video game in a third person.
So I see myself from behind my head 

1632
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:48,360
playing myself.
He'll fucking moon and taking my brain 

1633
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,600
talking.
But that's how I see the fights.

1634
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:55,010
I don't see the fight in me finding use 
from like a helicopter view above my 

1635
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:58,780
fucking right shoulder and I see it like
when I'm in the zone and I'm so,

1636
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,270
you know what I'm talking about,
emotional step back.

1637
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:03,590
And I'd like do this like little hop 
hopping that like puts me like.

1638
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:07,420
Then I like go behind fucking dialed in 
and it's like deep,

1639
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:08,810
deep,
everything just flows right.

1640
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,880
And I see myself out of body is crazy as
fuck.

1641
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,500
Sounds right.
From like a third party.

1642
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,890
Well I haven't heard it before from 
anybody else,

1643
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:25,891
but it doesn't sound crazy because I 
think what you're talking about is it's 

1644
01:07:25,891 --> 01:07:27,440
not you like your outside of you.
So I am.

1645
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:32,630
I'm literally outside of me.
It's like I'm telling that person what 

1646
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,300
to do from an outside perspective.
So when you're at your best like that,

1647
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:38,850
would you say you've done them?

1648
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,880
Fight the entire fight the entire from 
bell to bell.

1649
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:45,490
The Donald fight.
I was outside.

1650
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,980
I mean there wasn't a,
there wasn't a point we touched.

1651
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:53,010
I remember clear.
They'll seeing myself run across and 

1652
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:56,521
touch gloves and he was fucking on dee.
What was the fight before the Dunham 

1653
01:07:56,521 --> 01:07:56,521
fight?
Dos Anjos.

1654
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,830
So do you think that because of the dos 
Anjos loss,

1655
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,350
like you,
you've got more focused,

1656
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:05,740
more intense and then came out in the 
Dunham fight and you were just on fire.

1657
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,270
Fuck,
I wish I had an answer for that.

1658
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:08,400
I don't know.
I mean,

1659
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:11,190
I,
I totally underestimated the dust dust.

1660
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,060
Sondra.
Sondra stocking will not happen again.

1661
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,130
He's,
he's gotten a lot better.

1662
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:15,980
Know that guy works

1663
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,350
hard.
I know,

1664
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,360
I know.
He's your adversary and you're fighting 

1665
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:23,060
them,
but when you're at your best,

1666
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:25,450
would you say that you don't have any 
emotions at all?

1667
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:26,670
Zero,
right?

1668
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,530
Zero at,
at,

1669
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,520
at zero.
Yeah.

1670
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,820
And then when you're frustrated and 
you're in a bad place,

1671
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,070
you're battling your emotions.
Trying to calm them down.

1672
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,870
Try and.
Yeah.

1673
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:38,420
It's like I'm,
I'm like trying to find second gear.

1674
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:41,120
Yeah,
you know,

1675
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:43,250
it's like the worst sound in the world.
You know what I mean?

1676
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,570
That's what it fucking feels like when 
I'm just,

1677
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:48,620
I try to grinding,
grinding,

1678
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:52,280
grinding like cold motherfucker that's.
And he talked to yourself,

1679
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,320
you fucking pussy goal and that's what's
going through my mind.

1680
01:08:57,321 --> 01:08:58,510
Like,
I'm fat,

1681
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,560
can't find it.
I just can't find second gear.

1682
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:05,950
And it,
when you're in that place is the most 

1683
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:06,500
frustrating.
The absolute most frustrating man.

1684
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:09,010
There's nothing that means like,
what do,

1685
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:09,740
what do you do?

1686
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:15,040
Well,
do you think that it's possible that 

1687
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,400
through mental training and through 
specific techniques you could get better

1688
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:21,580
at achieving that,
what you would call maybe like a flow 

1689
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,630
state the same way you got better at 
being a fighter?

1690
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,630
Like think about your first days of 
fighting when you first learned Moitai,

1691
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,340
you know,
you weren't like,

1692
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,360
I'll tell you when I first saw you,
I saw you when you on the tap out show.

1693
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:33,800
Sure.
Because it was like,

1694
01:09:33,890 --> 01:09:37,970
who is this wild motherfucker hanging 
out with masks and throwing head kicks.

1695
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:41,270
But the cool thing about you,
what I felt you um,

1696
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:43,760
you sort of,
you were a pr,

1697
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:47,660
the personification of an idea that 
Eddie Bravo and I both had.

1698
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,960
And that idea was if you get a guy who's
a really good kickboxer but also has a 

1699
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:57,881
really good guard,
their fucking super dangerous because 

1700
01:09:57,881 --> 01:10:00,410
they're not worried about getting taken 
down so they throw those kicks freely.

1701
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,110
So you,
a lot of your early fights by submission

1702
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:04,100
off your back.
Correct?

1703
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:05,750
Because yeah,
I've just,

1704
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:08,170
well for one of my wrestling was zero.
Right?

1705
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,620
So I mean,
it's not like I was like,

1706
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,130
oh,
there's kicked freely and defend.

1707
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,250
He,
they just take me down.

1708
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:14,270
I mean,
it's fun.

1709
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,510
As you were to watch back then when I 
first watched you,

1710
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,680
are you telling me now?
Is that what's going on here?

1711
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:18,900
No,
no,

1712
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:20,420
no.
If you're a lot better now,

1713
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:21,290
right?
Sure.

1714
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,530
You're a lot better now.
So you got better at that.

1715
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:29,890
Do you think that you could get better 
the same way with your mind float and 

1716
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,420
don't you think that you should practice
that though?

1717
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:34,020
I should,
I should.

1718
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,440
I want to work on that.
I'm going to work on that.

1719
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:41,150
I think if you had a coach that could 
work through about this mind.

1720
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:46,630
Right?
And there's been times when I've been 

1721
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:50,050
hitting pads and I fucking go into flow 
state.

1722
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,580
You're in the zone.
I go into it fucking blah blah,

1723
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:54,970
blah.
I've seen you do it.

1724
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:58,490
I've seen videos of you doing two days 
ago by and I don't see it.

1725
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,860
Right.
That's how it goes though,

1726
01:11:00,861 --> 01:11:01,940
right?
But then sometimes it's like,

1727
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,830
dude,
it is like,

1728
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,550
it's like a drug man.
I think that state exists in everything.

1729
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:11,690
I think singers experience it.
I think also to basketball players,

1730
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,760
all sorts of different athletes 
experience that state and it's all about

1731
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:19,761
trying to find that state that state 
exists in standup comedy that state 

1732
01:11:19,761 --> 01:11:20,550
exists in and,
and I think in every,

1733
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,640
every thing that's difficult to do,
there's a time we use zone into his own 

1734
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,210
hand man or zone out.
Yeah,

1735
01:11:27,211 --> 01:11:28,470
whatever it is,
whatever it is,

1736
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:33,471
but it,
it only comes if you've dotted all your 

1737
01:11:33,471 --> 01:11:35,220
i's and crossed all your t's.
You have to have no worries at all about

1738
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:36,350
your preparation.
Oh No,

1739
01:11:36,351 --> 01:11:36,580
no,
no.

1740
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:39,870
That all has to be absolutely.
Yeah.

1741
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:44,871
You know,
and I think the drinking has any effect 

1742
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:47,530
on your physical performance or do you 
think that you,

1743
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,760
you do it at a level where you're not 
fucking with your endurance thing?

1744
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:58,041
I think,
I think people think that cowboy just 

1745
01:11:58,041 --> 01:11:59,720
drinks fucking 12 pack at night,
but that's like how many beers do you 

1746
01:11:59,720 --> 01:11:59,720
drink on a,
on a regular basis?

1747
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,730
Uh,
with dinner,

1748
01:12:02,731 --> 01:12:04,590
a couple.
If I'm out with friends,

1749
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:05,520
a couple,
you know,

1750
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:09,180
we'll put the six pack down,
maybe maybe graduate to a 12 pack,

1751
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:10,220
I don't know.
But uh,

1752
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,830
we're engaging and having a good time.
So this is a rare moment.

1753
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,110
Do I sit at home and drink alone?
No,

1754
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,420
absolutely.
Social drink social drinker.

1755
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,920
I hang out with my friends.
I'd have a couple beers.

1756
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:20,670
You know what?
Dinner.

1757
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:23,470
Um,
but a lot of times training,

1758
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,020
when you're training,
you're sore,

1759
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:25,950
you come home,
you know,

1760
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:26,920
he wrote up,
you're like,

1761
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:28,390
oh my God,
you want a beer?

1762
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,720
Yeah.
Did you put two,

1763
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:30,510
three beers down?
You're like,

1764
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,430
oh,
taste so much better.

1765
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,330
Yeah,
much better.

1766
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,250
Ice Cold Beer after training is one of 
the.

1767
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:39,210
Actually it's good for you too because 
there's something better.

1768
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:40,350
Chocolate milk.
Well,

1769
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:45,351
it's,
it's up there as long as you don't have 

1770
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:47,301
too much of it.
Just like a point of diminishing 

1771
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:47,301
returns.

1772
01:12:47,301 --> 01:12:48,400
They say that,
uh,

1773
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:50,700
the like,
I guess it's the hops or whatever it is.

1774
01:12:50,701 --> 01:12:52,590
It can replenish the glucose and your 
body,

1775
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:53,610
you know,
who uh,

1776
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,830
was a,
a Glucagon glycogen,

1777
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:56,780
whatever it is,
you know,

1778
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:01,790
who was a big believer in that one of 
the best ever boss route and boss route 

1779
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:02,010
and never stopped drinking.
He goes,

1780
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:03,900
hey,
I have a drink or two every night.

1781
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:08,860
Well he did eventually because he sort 
of developed an issue where,

1782
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,110
you know,
he's getting a little crazy with it,

1783
01:13:10,111 --> 01:13:11,520
but when he was training,
you know,

1784
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,220
he would have a couple of beers at night
and he didn't stop having it.

1785
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:16,110
I mean sometimes I'll drink two,
three,

1786
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:20,550
four nights in a row and I'll go,
I won't have a beer for a week,

1787
01:13:20,551 --> 01:13:21,360
two weeks.
I don't know,

1788
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:26,900
you know.
And so here I'm gonna tell you the 

1789
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:26,900
problem with drinking.

1790
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,200
Okay.
Are you ready for calculating velocity 

1791
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:30,200
on drinking?
I've been ready forever.

1792
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,090
Alright.
So me and you have a six pack.

1793
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:38,570
We roll over dinner,
six pack leads to a 12 pack and he's 

1794
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:38,570
just drinking shots,
leads,

1795
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:38,850
zillow,
staying at two in the morning.

1796
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:41,310
What do you do at two in the morning?
And you chase pussy right?

1797
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,360
So now you fucking find a girl,
you go home,

1798
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:50,750
she plays the.
I don't want to give you the pussy game 

1799
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:50,750
until 6:00
AM.

1800
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,740
I don't want to give you the pussy game.
Sounds rap stuff.

1801
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:56,880
Finally,
finally at six,

1802
01:13:56,881 --> 01:13:58,150
7:00
AM you do it.

1803
01:13:58,151 --> 01:14:01,560
Your deed fine.
Got Training at 9:30.

1804
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,650
I don't make it.
That's where I feel alcohol.

1805
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:08,400
Yes.
But if I have four or five beers,

1806
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:09,300
I go home,
go to sleep.

1807
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,070
Is it gonna affect my train mom?
I don't think so.

1808
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:12,040
Not at all.
As long

1809
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,380
as you have water,
not dehydrated,

1810
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:15,490
all that jazz.
Yeah.

1811
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,580
Do you watch your diet?
You absolutely not.

1812
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,880
Well,
floyd mayweather.

1813
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:23,630
Ate burgers 49,
12.

1814
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:24,760
Yeah.
I mean I just,

1815
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:28,330
I eat whatever I want to drink whatever 
I want and that's my life.

1816
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:33,390
So you never like,
you don't have like a dolce guy or 

1817
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:34,660
something like that.
It monitors your adult Tay Guy.

1818
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:35,980
How dare you,
how?

1819
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:39,690
What's wrong with adults?
You know,

1820
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:41,950
nothing's wrong.
It works great for Rhonda apparently.

1821
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:42,790
But,
um,

1822
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,770
does works great for a lot of people.
Right now.

1823
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:49,771
I don't,
I can't have you telling me if you said 

1824
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:49,771
cowboy,
calibrate that beer.

1825
01:14:49,771 --> 01:14:50,620
You can't eat pizza.
Pizza.

1826
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:51,700
Pizza.

1827
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:56,840
Pizza is like sex,
bad pizza or good beach.

1828
01:14:56,841 --> 01:14:58,330
It's still fucking pizza.
Brother does,

1829
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:03,360
but is there a way you could have the 
best of both worlds is the way that you 

1830
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:08,401
could like figure out how to give your 
body the best fuel and maybe I'll give 

1831
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:10,150
you a little slight edge on it.
That's going to help.

1832
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,400
You know,
supplements will help.

1833
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,920
Vitamins,
supplements and vitamins.

1834
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:15,910
Nothing.
Nothing.

1835
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:21,090
Nothing.
Molino 30 to around my friends can,

1836
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,990
can definitely preach for me.
I don't,

1837
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:24,940
I don't take,
I don't take shit.

1838
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,140
Nothing,
nothing.

1839
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:27,610
No protein powders,
nothing.

1840
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:30,520
I use it a little bit of medicinal 
marijuana on the fucking knee.

1841
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:36,210
The CBD oil.
You know what you should do with the 

1842
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,170
knees.
Fucking stem cell injections are 

1843
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:38,170
incredible.
Man.

1844
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:38,350
I,
he had one.

1845
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:43,740
He had a,
he was that close to surgery at a stem 

1846
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,070
cell injection in his knee and fixed 
them right up the.

1847
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:45,930
Yeah,
I mean I.

1848
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,960
Rhonda is apparently thinking about it.
She had her,

1849
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:54,030
one of her judo coaches just had stem 
cells done in his name to your steering 

1850
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:57,631
me away from medicinal marijuana.
Now I want you to do that to both do 

1851
01:15:57,631 --> 01:15:58,900
that too.
But don't do it as much as Nick Diaz or.

1852
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:03,950
No.
Do it refuse the urinalysis urine test?

1853
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,780
No,
I uh,

1854
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:05,390
I didn't.
I,

1855
01:16:05,391 --> 01:16:06,100
I,
uh,

1856
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,330
it was like a rub,
like a,

1857
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:08,920
uh,
I was in Colorado.

1858
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:09,970
I got A.
Oh yeah,

1859
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:11,800
they have creams.
Claim is exactly what it was.

1860
01:16:11,801 --> 01:16:13,390
It was like a cream,
like a,

1861
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:18,450
I think it was like a 50 to one cbd to 
thc.

1862
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,080
I got some of that chip and I'm scared 
of it,

1863
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,160
bro.
I put it on my knee.

1864
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:22,180
I didn't,
I didn't feel.

1865
01:16:22,181 --> 01:16:23,220
I didn't.
I mean there wasn't.

1866
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,070
No,
there wasn't.

1867
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,610
It was only like one percent 50 to one 
cbd and very little thc.

1868
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,100
Correct.
Oh,

1869
01:16:29,101 --> 01:16:34,101
I see.
And do the week of it and my knee felt 

1870
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:34,101
great.
Um,

1871
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:35,350
what's one of the best anti 
inflammatories nonbelievers?

1872
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:37,270
Well,
so and uh,

1873
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:37,990
but I don't,
I don't,

1874
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:41,050
I mean I don't smoke weed,
I don't shy on people that do,

1875
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:42,700
I don't give a fuck.
You do whatever to help people,

1876
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,110
you know,
make no difference to me.

1877
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,070
Um,
I just wish I could be on high.

1878
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:53,460
Have you ever been like,
like I used to get high when I was a 

1879
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:53,460
kid.
Like fuck,

1880
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:53,950
I'm done being high.
Wish it could be an high right now.

1881
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,920
Kind of like if you drink too much and 
you're spinning,

1882
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:58,480
you try to put your foot down on the 
floor.

1883
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:00,220
Like I wish I could be on fucking drunk 
right now.

1884
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,960
Same,
same kind of deal.

1885
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:03,130
I wish you know.
Well,

1886
01:17:03,131 --> 01:17:04,270
it's like everything,
you know,

1887
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,950
a little bit of moderation.
It's good.

1888
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:11,170
Coupled toots,
just a little bit hanging out with the 

1889
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:11,170
make a little Kissy

1890
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,590
kissy mean.
One of my good friends,

1891
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:17,591
airborne and camp,
that's all he would smoke religiously 

1892
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:17,591
every day and when we'd be isolate 
Harvard floor.

1893
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,350
So I give me,
fuck,

1894
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,540
let me hit that thing.
And the next Gen I'm over in the corner.

1895
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,710
Fucked out of my mind.
I want to be on higher.

1896
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,720
I don't have a tolerance for it.
And you're jumping right into the deep 

1897
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,000
end of the pool and he had swimming 
lessons.

1898
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,270
Okay.
To learn how to hold your breath.

1899
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,570
Breathe in.
Breathe.

1900
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,270
There's a lot of shit that goes into the
kitchen.

1901
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,580
I've had a lot of friends who are like,
let me see what the fuss is all about.

1902
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,100
I'll go,
okay,

1903
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:41,870
listen to me.
This shit right here.

1904
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:43,880
This glass tips.
Okay.

1905
01:17:43,881 --> 01:17:45,130
Smell this.
Yeah,

1906
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:45,590
yeah,
yeah.

1907
01:17:45,591 --> 01:17:48,500
They use glass glass at the top.
Take a smell of that.

1908
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:49,550
Just smell it.
Smell it.

1909
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,350
Just smelled it.
See that?

1910
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:53,220
That's not to be fucked with.
No,

1911
01:17:53,230 --> 01:17:53,650
you don't.
No.

1912
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:55,610
That's not to be fucked with.
You could smoke it,

1913
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:58,270
but you gotta be fucking careful.
You'll do this.

1914
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,470
This looks like something that I would 
find out on Colfax and Colorado,

1915
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:02,960
like,
like a crackhead crackhead's.

1916
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,520
Yeah.
Well you got to deal with this.

1917
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:05,870
You handed me this job.
Be like.

1918
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:07,550
I know.
Right?

1919
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:12,700
But usually use paper at the end of it,
but glasses better than paper and it 

1920
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,860
comes in a fucking bitch and little.
Yeah.

1921
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:17,450
Little spark that bitch up right now.
I will if you want me to.

1922
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:18,790
Do you want some of this?
No,

1923
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,530
I'm not going to know.
Okay.

1924
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:23,960
Now Watch.
So Vapor,

1925
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:27,020
Kush,
vapor air.

1926
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:28,010
It is glass tip.

1927
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:34,510
But I do this all the time.
I wouldn't recommend a hit like that for

1928
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,450
a third floor.
Me,

1929
01:18:35,451 --> 01:18:37,060
that'd be done.
No.

1930
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:42,190
W will confuse people.
It makes you anxious and freak out and 

1931
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:46,031
makes you confront all sorts of Shit 
that you've been keeping in the back of 

1932
01:18:46,031 --> 01:18:46,400
your head.
But I can fuck that shit all the time.

1933
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:48,050
So this is my friend.
Okay.

1934
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,450
I also want to dig in on us.
So I mean,

1935
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,400
I,
I guess I don't,

1936
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:55,460
I don't smoke weed.
I mean I've done it of course.

1937
01:18:55,461 --> 01:19:00,461
And um,
we did a backpacking trip with a couple 

1938
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:00,461
of buddies of mine and they brought 
weeds.

1939
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:01,470
Of course,
of course I smoked it,

1940
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:02,320
you know,
packing,

1941
01:19:02,330 --> 01:19:07,330
we'd go hand to hand and I was in charge
of the hands and I was in charge of the 

1942
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:08,720
GPS.
So where we're going,

1943
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:13,721
I don't know,
but it was two miles as the crow flies 

1944
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:13,721
every,
every fucking time they asked me where I

1945
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:13,721
was gone because we kept moving.

1946
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:15,260
But the spot we're going to stay the 
same.

1947
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:19,820
So everywhere we went it was.
So it's two miles as the crow flies.

1948
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:23,240
So miles as the crow flies is such a 
fucking mountain turn.

1949
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:28,540
People who have never hiked,
I have no idea what you're talking 

1950
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:28,540
about.
Right?

1951
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:30,770
But that's the idea folks,
is that if you go down and then up will,

1952
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:35,771
the distance between those points 
straight as a crow would fly is like a 

1953
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,090
mile,
but you're going like a mile and a half,

1954
01:19:38,091 --> 01:19:43,091
two miles,
maybe three if you were still fucking 

1955
01:19:43,091 --> 01:19:47,640
air taco night where we out.
I said it's two miles as the crow flies 

1956
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:47,640
and they'd be like,
you mother fucker.

1957
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:52,390
Dude.
I am amazed at how fucking tired hiking 

1958
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:53,730
gets you just fucking 80 pack ruck on 
your band.

1959
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:55,850
Yeah,
dude,

1960
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:57,790
trust me.
When you're,

1961
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:58,400
um,
when.

1962
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,080
Especially in Colorado.
Yeah.

1963
01:20:00,081 --> 01:20:01,950
Well we brought all our rock climbing 
gear with us.

1964
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:04,350
Probably 30,
40 pounds of climbing gear,

1965
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:07,040
30 40 pounds of gear,
and you're dealing with altitude.

1966
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:07,920
Fuck,
it's hard,

1967
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:09,570
man.
Where traditional climbers.

1968
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:11,910
So we sat her on anchors.
Oh Shit,

1969
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:12,720
me.
If you're going to do it,

1970
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:13,590
why not?
Well,

1971
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:18,591
I have this to make your.
You're fucking come all the way to a 

1972
01:20:18,591 --> 01:20:18,591
bed,
right?

1973
01:20:18,591 --> 01:20:21,850
That what you do.
You like to make your sphincter like 

1974
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:21,850
really fuck that clamp down.
That's the thing.

1975
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,120
That's another bucket when you,
when you go to,

1976
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:29,180
when you're hanging out on one day and 
you go to set that bolt and you don't 

1977
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:29,460
know if you said a good enough because 
you're fatigued.

1978
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:31,530
Oh Jesus Christ.
And he had to clip the rope.

1979
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,030
Sweaty hands is heron about this.
I had this cat.

1980
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,170
Uh,
Alex honnold.

1981
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:42,230
You know who he is.
He's the one of the greatest free 

1982
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:42,230
climbers in the world.

1983
01:20:42,230 --> 01:20:42,420
You want to talk about setting your 
sphincter.

1984
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:45,360
This guy climbed shit that most people 
don't even want to climb.

1985
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,930
That's him just taking their time shit 
with no ropes.

1986
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:54,290
And one time he's halfway up the mount.
When he realized that he forgot his 

1987
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,290
fucking chalk,
he didn't bring any powder,

1988
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,440
so he's halfway up the mountain and I 
don't even like to do kettle bells 

1989
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,070
without powder you at that point.
It's kind of give it a little.

1990
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:04,290
He just kept going.
He's an animal.

1991
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:06,330
I mean this fucking kid.
Look at what he's doing.

1992
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:08,370
Look at this.
Look at this fucking condo now.

1993
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:10,230
Today.
Your Pot fucking committed,

1994
01:21:10,231 --> 01:21:11,100
right?
When you're halfway,

1995
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:16,160
you don't just slam down.
So his only option is where's the 

1996
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:16,160
commode?
And I gotTa pee bad or right out there.

1997
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,430
Go right out the door and take a drink 
for fun.

1998
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:19,320
I hear you,
dude.

1999
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:22,600
Yes,
I'll be right up.

2000
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:27,680
Fine without you.
I'm Donald is going to be fighting for 

2001
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,030
the title in a fuck.
When is it?

2002
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,500
December in Orlando,
Florida.

2003
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:39,210
And he's fighting Hafael dos Anjos the 
guy who beat Anthony Pettis,

2004
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,250
who was,
uh,

2005
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,480
one of the baddest motherfuckers in the 
sport.

2006
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,310
So dos Anjos is a beast.
It's a,

2007
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:48,100
it's a really big fight,
a really important fight.

2008
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:52,050
And it's a fight that as much as he'll 
talk about how much he,

2009
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:52,490
uh,
you know,

2010
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,900
he doesn't give a fuck and he's having a
good time and everything like that.

2011
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:57,480
This is something he's been working 
towards for a long,

2012
01:21:57,481 --> 01:22:00,780
long time.
But like while he's peeing,

2013
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,240
I could just tell you this,
this is how this guy is all the time.

2014
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:06,060
Like he's not putting on a show.
He's a great guy too.

2015
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:08,490
He's fun to hang out with me and he's 
always like this.

2016
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:10,440
He's always friendly.
He's always like,

2017
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:12,150
when you hear about him getting in 
fights with people,

2018
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,340
like the fact that he barely net kicked 
that guy.

2019
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:16,260
If a lot of people said that,
I'd be like,

2020
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:18,720
please,
you fucking teed off on him.

2021
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:20,640
Like I would have probably teed off on 
him,

2022
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:25,730
but he really would like a nice Eddie 
Bravo or sheffield staring at me.

2023
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:30,740
We went to Sheffield already should 
fear.

2024
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:33,960
That's my buddy Mike Maxwell,
but made a bunch of a fear.

2025
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,490
Sheffield,
Sheffield,

2026
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,770
my girlfriend and my girlfriend's last 
name Sheffield.

2027
01:22:37,771 --> 01:22:38,880
So that.
Oh,

2028
01:22:38,881 --> 01:22:40,370
that's very different.
You think about art,

2029
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:42,570
you think about your girlfriend.
Things got weird,

2030
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,130
that kind of super fucking weird.
My friend Mike made a bunch of different

2031
01:22:47,131 --> 01:22:50,130
pictures of uh,
this is what Joey back there.

2032
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:54,510
We've got to revise the Joey Joey Diaz.
Wondering now which one was he?

2033
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,480
That's in the back.
It didn't work out.

2034
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:00,510
These are reduced.
So I just bought some new guns.

2035
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,650
Yeah,
I saw a man.

2036
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,290
So what is an integrity suppressed 300 
win mag.

2037
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,010
So,
and then that's where

2038
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:11,010
the suppressor is part of the barrel.
The suppressor for people that don't 

2039
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:11,650
know guns as a silencer.
That's it makes it really quiet.

2040
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:16,450
Sounds like a faggot.
And really all you hear is nothing.

2041
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,870
So you have a $300,
right?

2042
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,690
So it's a motherfucker of a gun.
So much kick.

2043
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:27,780
Um,
so this has very little kick to because 

2044
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,881
it's zero kick.
So normally if you're gay people they 

2045
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:30,400
shoot and the double tap,
right?

2046
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:33,890
Right.
Now you can do whatever you want.

2047
01:23:33,891 --> 01:23:35,590
And that's insane.
Insane.

2048
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,320
So we're super,
super sonic rounds,

2049
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:39,010
right?
Which is,

2050
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,500
it breaks the sound barrier that's in 
California,

2051
01:23:41,501 --> 01:23:42,310
isn't it?
This gun?

2052
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:43,440
I'm sure.
Fuck,

2053
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:44,980
everything is legal in California.
I have no idea,

2054
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:49,720
but.
So they make sub subsonic ammo again.

2055
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:51,030
All right,
so you don't hear it right?

2056
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:56,070
But we're shooting supersonic animal.
Just to prove a point why all you could 

2057
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:56,070
hear is the bulk.

2058
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:56,470
Clinique,
clinique,

2059
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,790
clinique insane.
So the guy that came out to my house,

2060
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,400
it's a keystone armory plugging them 
right now.

2061
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:04,840
But uh,
we'll please do.

2062
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,880
They would spit down the barrel because 
suppressors aren't made a gun.

2063
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:11,050
How many rounds is that?
Whole?

2064
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:13,540
Thirty two.
My 300 wind bangs,

2065
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:15,040
Banjo Bolt.
Action Rifles.

2066
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:17,260
The same one,
right?

2067
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:22,261
So I'm going to leave it is an,
we were literally shooting it in my 

2068
01:24:22,261 --> 01:24:24,610
backyard and the guys across the street,
we call them over.

2069
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:25,120
They're like,
dude,

2070
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:28,360
we thought you guys were just using your
nail guns shooting built in house.

2071
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,710
That's insane.
It's like clink clink,

2072
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:32,590
clink cookie.
So they have nine millimeter,

2073
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,310
45.
And uh,

2074
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,050
it sounds like a Pelican.
You can't even,

2075
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,180
probably can't even possess them in 
California,

2076
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:41,650
which is really weird.
You know,

2077
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:44,800
in Europe,
hunting without a silencer is rude.

2078
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:49,210
Like they all have suppressors because 
they don't want to hurt people's ears.

2079
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:54,240
Like they don't like,
it doesn't make sense that you can hunt 

2080
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:55,810
with an archery equipment archery setup,
which is totally silent.

2081
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:58,330
It's that bad as Talladega short of 
having ever been in Talladega.

2082
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,730
Never been telling me about Talladega.
So fun.

2083
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,930
Talladega and Daytona.
If you guys are Nascar fans or if you're

2084
01:25:04,931 --> 01:25:06,490
not,
you need to go.

2085
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,150
Just experience the infield.
You don't want to really like watching.

2086
01:25:10,151 --> 01:25:12,420
I like watching,
turning left and then right.

2087
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:15,640
I like a lot of movement in my racing.
I like that formula.

2088
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:17,760
One thing was around a lot.
Listen,

2089
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:21,430
Kevin Harvick is a dear friend of mine,
number four all day.

2090
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:26,700
And uh,
but they have this left turners on the 

2091
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,440
planet forever.
Nobody left her as we're going here.

2092
01:25:29,441 --> 01:25:31,930
Okay.
So I show up to Michigan,

2093
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,100
Michigan,
Michigan,

2094
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,500
Kevin's racing and I said,
you know what,

2095
01:25:35,501 --> 01:25:37,060
how,
how fucking good,

2096
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:38,380
how good can you.
I mean,

2097
01:25:38,381 --> 01:25:40,930
how hard could it be?
So I said,

2098
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,640
let's go to a gold cart race.
I'll fucking,

2099
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:44,200
I'll run with you.
Right?

2100
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:46,330
So he calls up the nearest go kart 
track,

2101
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:48,520
so it will be right there,
will show up.

2102
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:49,010
I said,
wait,

2103
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,220
where's the fastest car and fucking bad 
ass?

2104
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:53,140
Kevin says,
which ones is the slowest?

2105
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:58,950
This motherfucker was running laps 
around me in the fucking gold car and 

2106
01:25:58,950 --> 01:25:59,360
I'm a go golkar going,
motherfucker.

2107
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Like,
I feel like you're not going to beat me 

2108
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:05,000
in a go kart

2109
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,450
to say I'm a go kart going motherfuck.
Pull over and wait for me to catch up 

2110
01:26:09,450 --> 01:26:11,780
and fucking catch me again.
It's all about how they.

2111
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,240
You know when you're going,
when you're taking those corners and you

2112
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,640
hear earlier,
that means you're losing speed.

2113
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,220
He just,
I mean,

2114
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:20,430
he just knows how to cut the line.
Getting unbelievable.

2115
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,010
Well,
I would,

2116
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:24,500
I would imagine even to be just a guy 
who does nascar,

2117
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:26,810
you would have to be one of the top 
drivers in the world.

2118
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:30,610
The difference is that I.
I appreciate the shit out of and women,

2119
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:33,440
Danica,
she's hot too.

2120
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,590
Crazy.
Razi of racing to ever run is not hot.

2121
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:41,870
How dare you?
How dare you say it loudly and proudly.

2122
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:42,980
Goodness.

2123
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:48,980
You have higher standards of Neisser.
I think she's hot as fuck.

2124
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,640
You don't think she's hot?
I don't wanna I don't wanna get into 

2125
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:54,640
this.
We don't want to go.

2126
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,500
I love her too much.
When you,

2127
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:57,400
when you watch formula one race,
like,

2128
01:26:57,420 --> 01:26:59,810
do you feel like that you have a biased 
opinion when you're.

2129
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,490
When you're accommodating because you 
like her so much.

2130
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:04,700
I have a biased towards you too.
Okay.

2131
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:10,180
I do.
Next question to try to suppress this 

2132
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:10,180
question.
I tried to suppress it,

2133
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:14,600
but part of being a commentator is like 
uriah faber.

2134
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:16,550
I love that dude.
I think you're right.

2135
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:21,580
Favorite is a cool motherfucker.
I love talking to him right when he 

2136
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,581
fights.
I have to put myself in a place where I 

2137
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:24,581
don't think about that.
Tj,

2138
01:27:24,581 --> 01:27:25,700
when tj fights,
I have to put myself in a place.

2139
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:26,210
When I'm think about.

2140
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:27,520
I'll tell you what I hate.
I hate.

2141
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,570
I love Connor.
Right.

2142
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:34,690
I love that.
So my grandma always tells me a cheap 

2143
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:38,720
watches fight.
She used to put it on mute and there's 

2144
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:38,720
just a real fight.
She doesn't like me.

2145
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:38,720
No,
no.

2146
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,980
She loves you,
but she,

2147
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:45,010
she,
she just likes to be no silence and it's

2148
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:46,580
integrity.
You know?

2149
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:48,740
She should,
you know that they should offer that and

2150
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:49,350
he goes,
you,

2151
01:27:49,370 --> 01:27:54,370
Joe are to the fans can weigh the scale.
I know.

2152
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:59,640
I know that it's important for me to.
I try to be as objective about,

2153
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:05,510
but I also have to be honest,
if something's happening and some guys 

2154
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:09,460
that you see,
sometimes the judges don't agree with 

2155
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:09,840
the fans,
you will,

2156
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:10,510
you,
you,

2157
01:28:10,511 --> 01:28:13,820
you are heavy on the scale.
One side but big.

2158
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:18,350
But I probably am better at it than the 
judges.

2159
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:18,770
Sure.

2160
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:23,830
There's a real problem and that's an 
arrogant thing to say that they're 

2161
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:24,420
watch.
You don't.

2162
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,480
I don't think this is the Friday just 
happened and I obviously I heard about 

2163
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,170
it sucked.
I heard it,

2164
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:32,390
but it's totally not even remotely 
surprised.

2165
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,800
I haven't recorded.
I'm going to watch it,

2166
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:34,770
you know,
Bam,

2167
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,030
Bam.
Watch on fight pass and Bam,

2168
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:38,840
Bam,
Bam,

2169
01:28:38,841 --> 01:28:39,680
Bam.
Won The fight.

2170
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:44,740
But we've seen that man,
we saw that happens all the time in 

2171
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:48,260
Ramsey Mitchum's last fight a lot with 
the Henderson and myself first fight.

2172
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:49,430
I feel like I won,
you know,

2173
01:28:49,431 --> 01:28:51,800
the third fight that we just had.
I don't fucking know,

2174
01:28:51,801 --> 01:28:54,500
man.
It could have got honestly tell you.

2175
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:59,501
I thought he edged you.
So I just studied and it was a very 

2176
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,920
close fight and it wasn't a.
It wasn't a travesty.

2177
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,350
Sure.
This travesty,

2178
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:05,490
and I'm,
and I'm,

2179
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:07,330
I'm not hiding anything.

2180
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:11,640
Benson is one of the fucking best on the
planet and you're one of the best in the

2181
01:29:11,641 --> 01:29:13,260
planet.
It was a great fight.

2182
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,280
I mean,
it wasn't.

2183
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:15,140
There was,
I mean,

2184
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:17,820
there was no doubt about it.
It was a super high level,

2185
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:20,940
very entertaining fight and is coming 
down to help me train for this fight.

2186
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:22,200
That's awesome.
I love that dude.

2187
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,660
He's got a great soul.
That's what he told me.

2188
01:29:24,661 --> 01:29:25,410
He's like,
hey man,

2189
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:30,411
it's a good one.
They gave me the first one fucking go 

2190
01:29:30,411 --> 01:29:30,411
get it.
That's what he said to me.

2191
01:29:30,411 --> 01:29:31,710
That's beautiful.
I'm glad he did that.

2192
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:32,500
You know,
I,

2193
01:29:32,780 --> 01:29:34,710
I'm,
I'm biased towards a lot of guys.

2194
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:37,860
I'm biased towards a Chad Mendez.
I love that dude.

2195
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:40,170
I think he's a great guy.
I mean,

2196
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:42,600
but when they're fighting.
Damn Dude,

2197
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:47,601
I tried to let all that shit slide away.
I try to look at it as objectively as 

2198
01:29:47,601 --> 01:29:49,330
possible,
so like in the like the Rhonda fight,

2199
01:29:49,590 --> 01:29:52,050
if batch beat the fuck out of Rhonda in 
that fight,

2200
01:29:52,051 --> 01:29:56,220
I would be calling in as if it was one 
of the most spectacular moments in mma.

2201
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:00,120
Even though I'm a friend of Ron does and
ass that she looked.

2202
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:04,650
That was damn Leonard Garcia.
Ronda fight.

2203
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:09,090
She just put hit down on her mouthpiece 
and fuck that girl up gaming and and did

2204
01:30:09,091 --> 01:30:14,091
it like flawlessly.
That fucking righthand she hit her with 

2205
01:30:14,091 --> 01:30:14,550
and then tagged with the left that she's
going down.

2206
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:17,810
She's not whinging shit.
She's throwing perfect clientele.

2207
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:21,180
Come on.
Those were wingers fight,

2208
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:25,500
but she's throwing clean technique.
Man is for her to winger,

2209
01:30:25,890 --> 01:30:29,610
but the way she landed the righthand 
that as the girls going down,

2210
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:31,580
she gets with the left,
there's no wind up with that.

2211
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:36,330
Has the bank b bank and been fucking 
striking for a few years.

2212
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:39,360
Man is a recent thing because if it 
will,

2213
01:30:39,361 --> 01:30:40,860
it will.
You know what man,

2214
01:30:40,861 --> 01:30:44,850
if you're one of those fucking people 
like that girl's got that brain.

2215
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,150
If you're one of those fucking people,
she could be the best surfer.

2216
01:30:48,270 --> 01:30:50,490
She could be.
She'd find her way.

2217
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:55,810
You know,
if Danica Patrick was the number one 

2218
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:55,810
nascar driver,
she'd find a way to get in front of that

2219
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:55,810
bitch.
You know what I'm saying?

2220
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:58,710
I'm sure there's some people out there 
that doesn't like that girl doesn't have

2221
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:03,711
any loser in her.
She figures out a way to win when their 

2222
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:03,970
whole life.
Her mother is a bad motherfucker too.

2223
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,050
Can you say that a mother is a bad 
motherfucker.

2224
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:12,620
That motherfucker is used as loosely as 
is for Australian or English.

2225
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:15,760
English.
She.

2226
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,360
This is a term of endearment.
He's a good con.

2227
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:21,240
I was with these wild,
awesome fisher.

2228
01:31:21,241 --> 01:31:22,950
He was just with me today and that's all
he said.

2229
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,660
You fucking cunt.
Get chicken.

2230
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:29,640
Chicken or am 3:50
year.

2231
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,110
Fucking can't.
What's an rm?

2232
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,140
Three Slash 15 ram $3,500.

2233
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:38,670
Crazy,
right?

2234
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:41,790
No.
It's a ram over those.

2235
01:31:41,791 --> 01:31:44,190
Over there.
I have a buddy who lives in Australia is

2236
01:31:44,191 --> 01:31:48,430
the biggest truck you can get as like a 
Toyota Tacoma Tundra or something.

2237
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:53,440
So and so we're at.
We're at a bar in Vegas and they just 

2238
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:53,440
tell these guys,
hey,

2239
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,870
and I'm like,
if I would say,

2240
01:31:54,930 --> 01:31:58,050
hey,
you can't get thrown out of the Bar,

2241
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,320
will worlds folks built that?
It's different than a bar made a bar 

2242
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:06,770
maid grandma Roger conked out.
She would just.

2243
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:10,360
I mean,
I don't know if she could understand him

2244
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,400
and I was like,
what is going on here?

2245
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:14,830
Did you tell him?
That is different for us.

2246
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:20,150
We have civilized folk.
We actually had to turn in the modern 

2247
01:32:20,150 --> 01:32:22,921
world.
They're living in the fifties over 

2248
01:32:22,921 --> 01:32:22,921
there.
It's like a John Wayne movie.

2249
01:32:22,921 --> 01:32:25,120
Unbelievable.
I love Australia,

2250
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:27,160
man.
I fucking love going there too.

2251
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,800
I'm looking forward to Melbourne.
I'd never been to mountain dogs fighting

2252
01:32:29,801 --> 01:32:31,720
there is he?
Is He fighting that card?

2253
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:33,310
Fighting other ranch.
I like that dude.

2254
01:32:33,370 --> 01:32:35,480
Yes.
Column Logan Strong did call.

2255
01:32:35,481 --> 01:32:40,481
Nope.
Wasn't me a bodyguard to the crocodile 

2256
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:43,681
hunter.
He was not crazy and we talk about all 

2257
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:46,351
the time.
So you want to know even a crazier 

2258
01:32:46,351 --> 01:32:48,391
fucking story.
So Kyle knows and Jonathan Webb just 

2259
01:32:48,391 --> 01:32:51,631
signed to the UFC train.
The Jonathan who had been at the ranch 

2260
01:32:51,631 --> 01:32:53,320
came and trained call for his fight the 
entire way.

2261
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:55,900
Kyle,
his opponent got pulled out.

2262
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:57,580
They called Jonathan,
hadn't paid the fight,

2263
01:32:57,910 --> 01:33:00,670
so they train for each other the entire 
fucking eight weeks.

2264
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,460
Oh my God.
Thought each other.

2265
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:05,950
Jesus Christ.
So they have to fight each other.

2266
01:33:05,951 --> 01:33:06,710
They did.
It did.

2267
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:09,420
Where did they fight in Australia?
Who won that?

2268
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,290
Kyle one.
Wow.

2269
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:13,570
That's hard.
Right?

2270
01:33:13,571 --> 01:33:15,700
And Jonathan looked spectacular,
man.

2271
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,170
It was unbelievable.
It was crazy.

2272
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,060
It was for all of us,
like coaching and internal guys.

2273
01:33:21,061 --> 01:33:22,090
It was like,
what?

2274
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,050
But Kyle Co tells Jonathan,
you idiot if you don't take the fight.

2275
01:33:26,380 --> 01:33:28,420
You know what I mean?
You're be a fight in the UFC.

2276
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,610
All you want to do.
So you stupid bitch.

2277
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,110
Take the fight.
And that's,

2278
01:33:32,350 --> 01:33:33,130
I mean,
that's.

2279
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:38,230
If you had that happen to you other than
Benson.

2280
01:33:38,231 --> 01:33:41,080
I mean I fought.
I'm Melvin Gallard.

2281
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:42,430
Yeah.
Oh that's right.

2282
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:44,790
You train with Melbourne very many 
years.

2283
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,630
So there was some psychological warfare 
and that fight too.

2284
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,720
Sure.
Because you said that Melvin used to 

2285
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:53,720
quit and training like I'm going to make
them quit again.

2286
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:54,400
Yeah,
absolutely.

2287
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:59,680
We're not psychological a lot on your 
friend to write on your friend.

2288
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:05,660
They'll get dow,
but the son of his came out and whammer 

2289
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:05,660
dampered me,
didn't he?

2290
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:06,370
Yeah,
he left hooks.

2291
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:12,120
Hold up here.
Was that the hardest time you ever been 

2292
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,941
hit?
I think you said in one of those UFC 

2293
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:16,531
countdown things.
That was the hardest thing other than 

2294
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:16,531
Lynn or training.
Yeah.

2295
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:19,920
I was wanting to rock on a rope,
so other than that,

2296
01:34:21,671 --> 01:34:26,671
but a rope that's hilarious for people 
don't know where he talking about.

2297
01:34:27,461 --> 01:34:29,620
If you had a rock on the end of a rope,
just swung it.

2298
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:34,270
That's the way limit throws rock and 
roll a rock on her rope.

2299
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:35,800
Wow.
I mean,

2300
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,810
you know,
it was a great video.

2301
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:42,900
We're a connor.
Love him or hate him is a teaching when 

2302
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,710
he's coaching this this season of the 
ultimate fighter and they're doing these

2303
01:34:44,711 --> 01:34:48,940
real specific drills and he said a cool 
thing that I think John Kavanagh says.

2304
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:54,150
He said,
this is upgrading your software without 

2305
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,350
damaging your hardware.
There's two schools of thought.

2306
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:56,780
Right?
Right.

2307
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:57,980
There's that school of thought,

2308
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,900
like fight smart,
train smart,

2309
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:05,140
and then there's the school of thought 
where you hard ride jet skis over the 

2310
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:08,120
top of cliffs the day before you fight.
Well,

2311
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:08,870
we made.
Wait,

2312
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:12,020
let's go fucking swim with sharks.
I mean,

2313
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,760
that's,
that's your school thoughts,

2314
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:16,440
sort of a different school of thought.
Very much so.

2315
01:35:16,441 --> 01:35:16,900
Yeah.
I,

2316
01:35:16,901 --> 01:35:21,901
uh,
how hard training sessions are you 

2317
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:22,580
having in camp?
Are you guys going full out?

2318
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,510
Sure,
sure.

2319
01:35:23,511 --> 01:35:25,790
I mean some days,
some days,

2320
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:26,720
not,
some days.

2321
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:27,530
Not.
So I might,

2322
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:29,540
I may wake up on Tuesday like I'm not 
filling it.

2323
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:33,230
I'll go fucking late board.
Just decided not train.

2324
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:38,370
Yeah,
I mean I got all the guys on my coach 

2325
01:35:38,370 --> 01:35:40,121
right there and they,
they been with me for so long that they 

2326
01:35:40,121 --> 01:35:40,121
just say,
okay.

2327
01:35:40,121 --> 01:35:42,080
So you know,
a lot of people think that that actually

2328
01:35:42,081 --> 01:35:44,380
is a smart thing that that's active 
recovery.

2329
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,460
I'm tired,
I'll call it sold the day.

2330
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,950
Do you.
But you like to still do things though?

2331
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:52,790
Oh yeah man.
I mean,

2332
01:35:52,791 --> 01:35:56,890
we go rock climbing,
wakeboarding,

2333
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:58,280
right?
But if you think about that,

2334
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:00,860
like,
so you're still working,

2335
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:02,660
you're still moving your body,
right?

2336
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,310
You're not taking a day and just 
sleeping,

2337
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,780
man.
There's been,

2338
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:09,350
I don't know how many days of my life 
that have just done nothing but slept.

2339
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:11,990
Look at today's Day.
I got off the plane,

2340
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,670
went surfing,
trained.

2341
01:36:13,671 --> 01:36:14,720
Oh boy.
Now I'm here.

2342
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:18,650
It was just always moving,
running and a gun in baby.

2343
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,600
I love it man.
I love it.

2344
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,830
I mean that's just,
that's my,

2345
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:26,960
that's how I'm geared.
I've just had,

2346
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:30,170
I had in my friends have to take breaks.
They tell me all the time,

2347
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:32,690
my cowboy,
I got a week for you after that.

2348
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:34,900
We got,
we got,

2349
01:36:34,960 --> 01:36:38,510
we got tagged team somebody else in 
because we can't keep this fucking pace.

2350
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,430
You're too much.
You go go,

2351
01:36:40,431 --> 01:36:40,880
go,
go,

2352
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:41,210
go,
go.

2353
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:43,940
Like there's days that I'll train weight
board all day and come back and train.

2354
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,740
Wow.
And just uh,

2355
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,470
eh.
But you're enjoying it.

2356
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:53,471
So you're getting a rush the whole time.
So when I look at life right now is I'm 

2357
01:36:53,471 --> 01:36:57,040
retired now because when I quit making 
money and it's time to proper retire,

2358
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:04,091
I'm not going to have any money.
So going to feed you and go scuba 

2359
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:04,091
diving,
not scuba diving.

2360
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:05,300
My favorite thing,
I'm going 400 feet.

2361
01:37:05,990 --> 01:37:08,660
All you need is a good financial 
advisor.

2362
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:13,720
All you need is someone who you trust to
take care of your money and and handle 

2363
01:37:13,720 --> 01:37:15,560
shit and make sure you always say what?
Say what?

2364
01:37:15,561 --> 01:37:19,530
The goddamn money just I stayed at her 
trailer hitch.

2365
01:37:19,531 --> 01:37:20,210
That's what I'm saying.

2366
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:27,640
But if you just stay being cowboy,
we just need to figure out a way to get 

2367
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,180
this out that you don't have to work 
again a day in your life.

2368
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:31,370
When you're writing,
you're not going to be broke.

2369
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,320
You just needed the right guy to steer 
you.

2370
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:35,420
You're a fucking.
I got my grandma.

2371
01:37:35,421 --> 01:37:35,900
She,
she,

2372
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:37,220
she,
I tell her all the time.

2373
01:37:37,221 --> 01:37:39,460
Maybe she's the Gal.
She is perfect.

2374
01:37:39,461 --> 01:37:41,310
I can.
I asked her what she said.

2375
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,700
Fucking ride it till the wheels burn 
off.

2376
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,760
Mother.
Motherfucking people know you're out 

2377
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:50,951
there.
That's all you need to do the 

2378
01:37:50,951 --> 01:37:50,951
difference.
I mean,

2379
01:37:50,951 --> 01:37:51,320
what you've got what you are.
I mean,

2380
01:37:51,321 --> 01:37:52,860
I'm not blowing.
I'm retired now.

2381
01:37:52,861 --> 01:37:56,040
Who are is like what everybody wants out

2382
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:01,040
of their superheroes when 50.
This is lit as fuck.

2383
01:38:01,181 --> 01:38:04,550
And I can't wake board running 
triathlons with fancy guy.

2384
01:38:04,551 --> 01:38:08,280
Like that's what everybody wants.
They want a guy who's just living like a

2385
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:10,260
fucking wild man and going in there,
there's,

2386
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:13,110
there's something appealing to that.
There's something that's called live,

2387
01:38:13,111 --> 01:38:18,111
a life worth living,
but there's some appeal to the Spartan 

2388
01:38:18,111 --> 01:38:19,410
to write something appealing to.
The guy's willing to not have sex.

2389
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:22,170
Shout out all distractions,
put a fucking poster on his wall,

2390
01:38:22,171 --> 01:38:27,171
write down goals.
Some Dan Gable type dude who's just 

2391
01:38:27,171 --> 01:38:28,740
stoic and fucking never ending an 
indomitable spirit.

2392
01:38:28,741 --> 01:38:32,010
And this guy just doesn't do anything 
for his body.

2393
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,330
Hey brother,
you want to go?

2394
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:36,360
Fucking weight board wouldn't be the God
man.

2395
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:39,480
I'm fucking in the zone.
And I'm like,

2396
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:44,690
what's the,
the zone we are talking about when 

2397
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:44,690
you're behind.
No,

2398
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:44,690
that's not today.
That's,

2399
01:38:44,690 --> 01:38:48,950
that's in your fight.
We're discussing fund today and they 

2400
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:48,950
don't.
And I said,

2401
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:49,110
well,
alright,

2402
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,010
I'm going to go have some fun.

2403
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:53,370
It's a balance,
right?

2404
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:55,500
It's trying to figure out what's the 
best way to do it.

2405
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,380
What's the best way to do it?
Because like Dan Gable I brought up.

2406
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:59,640
Did you play football?
No,

2407
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,740
never played football.
Steered away from that Shit.

2408
01:39:01,770 --> 01:39:02,350
Okay.
So you hear,

2409
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,510
you hear the guys that are still 35,
40 years old talking about that game,

2410
01:39:06,700 --> 01:39:07,590
right?
They had.

2411
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:11,150
Yup.
I think that's what I searched for every

2412
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:11,940
day,
you know,

2413
01:39:11,941 --> 01:39:15,650
like fighting is fucking love it and get
six times a year if I'm lucky.

2414
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:17,700
And this year I'm good at one time.
So,

2415
01:39:17,701 --> 01:39:22,701
uh,
I think that's why I do the things I do 

2416
01:39:22,701 --> 01:39:24,090
because it gives me that feeling that 
I'm searching for that scared.

2417
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:26,070
What am I doing?
Oh my God.

2418
01:39:26,071 --> 01:39:29,160
Feeling where you'd like proven yourself
and you'd like it to be true.

2419
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,680
And those are two things that a lot of 
people shy away from.

2420
01:39:31,730 --> 01:39:33,480
I mean,
know competition.

2421
01:39:33,481 --> 01:39:35,830
If you can right now and said you're 
better bowhunter me.

2422
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,060
I bet we'll set the motherfucker 
targeted.

2423
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:39,780
Let's go,
let's do it.

2424
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,580
And that's just,
I mean so.

2425
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:43,950
Well that's also the only way you get 
good at anything.

2426
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:49,190
People shy away from that.
Just there's only one way you could 

2427
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:52,440
surround yourself with bad motherfuckers
are doing exactly what you do and you 

2428
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,640
force yourself to keep up.
And we inspire each other.

2429
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:58,641
That is the problem in this sport 
because I see that in the gym all the 

2430
01:39:58,641 --> 01:39:58,641
time.
You see it,

2431
01:39:58,641 --> 01:40:00,840
the guys sparring day comes or grabbing 
day comes.

2432
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:04,480
You see all the guys finding the guy 
they know they can be.

2433
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:06,590
They don't go after the guy that kills 
them.

2434
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,120
Me,
I want you motherfucker.

2435
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:11,880
But I want to.
You want the toughest challenge.

2436
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,320
You're the baddest dude you want.

2437
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,340
Let's go.
Fuck me,

2438
01:40:14,350 --> 01:40:16,410
I want the one that's going to stir you 
up inside.

2439
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:19,650
Fucking burn me where you submit me 
three times in five minutes.

2440
01:40:19,770 --> 01:40:22,380
Not going to happen again because you 
know what I mean?

2441
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,050
That's how I think.
You fucking fuck me.

2442
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:27,690
I'm calling my coach like I just got 
fucked up.

2443
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:29,820
Let's fix this problem.
Right?

2444
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:35,120
So that's,
I mean that I want the guys that pushed 

2445
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:35,120
me.
I need those.

2446
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:35,120
I need that in my.
Well,

2447
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:36,000
when you get to the level that you're at
to,

2448
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:41,001
you also realize that those guys that 
push you or the reason why you put in 

2449
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:44,340
that extra effort that takes you to the 
top of your ability and there's that.

2450
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,460
There's this,
there's a few guys that we all know that

2451
01:40:47,461 --> 01:40:50,460
never quite reached the top of their 
ability.

2452
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,500
Like you hear about them in the gym,
they're fucking on fire.

2453
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:54,970
They just have the,
you know,

2454
01:40:55,420 --> 01:41:00,420
they have,
they have days where they world beaters 

2455
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:03,210
and for whatever reason they don't ever 
get it together in the moment of crisis 

2456
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:05,200
is Jim Heroes,
right?

2457
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:10,380
Absolutely.
It's the sport is an believable man.

2458
01:41:10,661 --> 01:41:15,661
It's like you have to be able to go out 
there and fight at your best every 

2459
01:41:15,661 --> 01:41:17,050
single day and you have to execute under
insane pressure.

2460
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,630
That's the most admirable quality about 
it.

2461
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:24,830
You know,
like sometimes when I look around like 

2462
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:25,360
that was one of the craziest things 
about Rhonda fight was after she knocked

2463
01:41:25,361 --> 01:41:30,361
out bench go hand,
she just strutted around the cage and 

2464
01:41:30,361 --> 01:41:33,380
looked up at.
Everybody just took it all in stride.

2465
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:38,410
It shifts face,
planted that chick on a straight out of 

2466
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:38,410
compton.
Add.

2467
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:39,280
Okay.
I mean she really did.

2468
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:41,260
Which the movie was fucking 
unbelievable.

2469
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,850
I didn't see the movie.
You haven't seen the movie?

2470
01:41:42,870 --> 01:41:43,540
No,
I didn't see them.

2471
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:44,830
Great.
I'm sure it's great.

2472
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:49,831
It's great.
But the fact that she face plant that 

2473
01:41:49,831 --> 01:41:50,050
are on that and then just walked around 
the that moment,

2474
01:41:50,410 --> 01:41:52,660
like that moment.
Who the fuck understands that moment?

2475
01:41:52,661 --> 01:41:57,661
But her.
Who are you or anybody who experiences 

2476
01:41:57,661 --> 01:41:57,661
it,
you know the,

2477
01:41:57,661 --> 01:41:59,470
the moment where you know,
think of like the Edson Barboza fight we

2478
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:04,471
crack on with that jab and then take his
back like that moment when when your 

2479
01:42:04,471 --> 01:42:07,800
taps and you stand up and the whole 
crowd goes fucking ape shit because it 

2480
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,130
was chaos up until that moment,
right?

2481
01:42:09,131 --> 01:42:10,750
He came out,
guns blazing.

2482
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:12,660
Then you caught him with that Jab.
He went down.

2483
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:15,580
You've got his back and strangle them.
That moment man.

2484
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,950
When you were in the,
in the fire.

2485
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:20,530
In that moment,
Barbara has as he blinks,

2486
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:24,700
but in that moment,
about 20 seconds before that moment,

2487
01:42:24,701 --> 01:42:25,360
I knew I got him.

2488
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:30,570
How'd you know?
Because he hit me with fucking 

2489
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:30,570
everything he had in the kitchen sink.
And when he unloaded Babe Babe,

2490
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:31,960
Babe,
babe being kicked me as hard as he could

2491
01:42:32,380 --> 01:42:34,350
and I just stood there and he looked at 
his corner is like,

2492
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,830
now what?
I was like.

2493
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,380
Gotcha.
So,

2494
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:42,540
uh,
so you saw a moment of thinking on a 

2495
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:43,150
moment of contemplation.
I got it.

2496
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:45,550
I got you.
He's a talented motherfucker.

2497
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:46,480
Talented.
Absolutely.

2498
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:51,510
That's which kick that he was hitting 
Paul felter with was the fastest which 

2499
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:54,811
could I've ever seen in my life.
I'd never seen anybody throw it like 

2500
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:54,811
that.
Hard and fast.

2501
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:57,250
Like Jesus fucking Christ.
Well,

2502
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:02,550
Mark Henry and ginger.
So it's showing a little bit more than 

2503
01:43:03,490 --> 01:43:04,900
he could be black.
Like check Congo.

2504
01:43:05,620 --> 01:43:07,480
You would've been impressed by that 
kick.

2505
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:08,850
That kick was insane.
Right?

2506
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,180
He's so fast,
man.

2507
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:12,040
And his coach,
Mark Henry,

2508
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:17,190
that's a guy who's like one of the most 
underappreciated guys and this port and 

2509
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:17,650
after the fight they came in and said,
man,

2510
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:18,200
we,
we,

2511
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:20,410
we studied Paul to a tee.

2512
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:22,470
We tunes fight.
So serious dude.

2513
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,500
He's a wizard.
That guy,

2514
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:25,540
he's the unsung.
He's like a really quiet guy.

2515
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:30,541
He doesn't want a lot of attention,
but I admire the fuck out of the way 

2516
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:34,420
that guy coaches Frankie Edgar,
the way that guy like conor and Frankie,

2517
01:43:34,421 --> 01:43:35,450
I love Frankie.
Ooh,

2518
01:43:35,470 --> 01:43:36,520
I'd love to.
Have you ever seen.

2519
01:43:36,560 --> 01:43:37,690
Have you ever seen the guy?
And he goes,

2520
01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:39,280
fuck you.
Fuck you.

2521
01:43:39,281 --> 01:43:41,230
Fuck your cool air.
Fuck you.

2522
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:46,231
That's.
I feel like what happened at the press 

2523
01:43:46,231 --> 01:43:46,840
conference because Frankie was.
You're welcome.

2524
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:48,310
That was it.
Yeah,

2525
01:43:48,311 --> 01:43:50,230
so I felt like the fuck you.
Fuck,

2526
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:56,010
you're cool and fuck you.
That's what would happen because the 

2527
01:43:56,141 --> 01:44:01,141
ability of level change that he puts his
face to love frank.

2528
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:04,130
Frankie will set a goal.
Got to run a ultra,

2529
01:44:04,131 --> 01:44:09,131
ultra marathon with him.
You got to be willing to go to the 

2530
01:44:09,131 --> 01:44:12,290
depths of your ability and there's a guy
that fought at 55 undersized and won the

2531
01:44:12,291 --> 01:44:13,070
fucking title.

2532
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:16,400
Always crazy one.
The title undersized.

2533
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:21,580
He was so much smaller than Bj.
So much smaller than a lot of the guys 

2534
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:24,581
he beat had those tough fights with 
Henderson mean he's that fight with cub 

2535
01:44:24,721 --> 01:44:25,490
Swanson.
I was like,

2536
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:28,820
good Lord,
that fucking Pacey puts people.

2537
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:31,630
He's like,
he's taken it to the next level.

2538
01:44:31,650 --> 01:44:33,800
When I talk about guys who put paces 
like that,

2539
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:38,801
wrestlers break you pace.
Nobody liked Frankie right now in the 

2540
01:44:38,801 --> 01:44:38,801
sport.
He's,

2541
01:44:38,801 --> 01:44:40,490
he's the epitome of that style of 
fighting.

2542
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:44,100
Maybe Weidman could show it to in some 
fights if he gets the right apartment.

2543
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:48,950
A crazy fight.
Rockhold is a bad motherfucker.

2544
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:51,440
That's a crazy fight.
Rockhold Rocco's.

2545
01:44:51,441 --> 01:44:54,080
Jujitsu is nasty man.
The Way He controlled the Ota.

2546
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:56,300
Machida,
I was impressed as fuck.

2547
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:58,130
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

2548
01:44:58,131 --> 01:45:00,320
his grounded pound is controlling the 
ground.

2549
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:05,620
He,
he beat Leo Machida at every facet of 

2550
01:45:05,620 --> 01:45:06,680
the game and that was impressive as 
fuck.

2551
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:08,210
To me.
That was a high profile fight.

2552
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,790
It was a big fight.
I that impressed the fuck out of me,

2553
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:13,310
you know,
I think it's a great fight.

2554
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,290
Weidman's a monster man.
What do you think?

2555
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:16,030
Your laughing?
No,

2556
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:16,430
no,
I,

2557
01:45:16,540 --> 01:45:17,240
I,
I,

2558
01:45:17,241 --> 01:45:19,130
uh,
rock holds a dear friend of mine,

2559
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:20,750
so I love that dude.
I mean,

2560
01:45:20,751 --> 01:45:22,300
he's out of cubes.
Camp is the only.

2561
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:25,210
Yeah,
no,

2562
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,480
I know.
I like him.

2563
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:28,050
I know about all that.
Great Dude.

2564
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,860
Khabib,
you know,

2565
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:33,140
there's always gonna be that thing going
on between y'all.

2566
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:35,400
You guys at the very top,
you know,

2567
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:41,140
stirring the pudding again,
like a guy like Khabib Kinda need that 

2568
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:41,210
motherfucker.
That guy.

2569
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:42,740
He's,
he's like a tank,

2570
01:45:42,741 --> 01:45:46,400
a propane out there for you.
You know he's going to that gym.

2571
01:45:47,110 --> 01:45:52,110
Yeah,
that's the guy because he's so fucking 

2572
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:52,110
good.
I mean,

2573
01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:52,830
you look at the way he manhandled dos 
Anjos.

2574
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:54,020
I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

2575
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,200
Habib Nuremberg.
Madoff is a grappling motherfucker.

2576
01:45:57,230 --> 01:46:02,230
His,
his wrestling as someone really 

2577
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:02,840
appreciates the guy's ability to impose 
his game plan.

2578
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,060
He impresses the fuck out of me.
Absolutely.

2579
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:08,180
That guys like giant tank,
a propane for cowboy.

2580
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:13,250
That's a crazy way to make a living man.
You've got all these tanks.

2581
01:46:13,401 --> 01:46:15,260
Have propane out there.
Anthony Pettis.

2582
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:16,910
That's it.
He's another propane tank.

2583
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,700
Oh yeah.
Anthony told me and he's a cowboy.

2584
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:22,180
If you need me to come down and train 
you for deciding.

2585
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:23,750
Yes.
I hate that motherfucker.

2586
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,130
Haley there.
Wow.

2587
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,140
That's a pet is home.
I just hit you up on that.

2588
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,970
Wow.
That would be a good thing man.

2589
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:30,800
He can give you some insight.
I love that dude.

2590
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:32,480
So do.
I mean I gained with pedes.

2591
01:46:32,481 --> 01:46:37,481
I got nothing back.
I really don't have anything bad to say 

2592
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:37,481
about any of the guys up at the top.

2593
01:46:37,481 --> 01:46:37,481
You know,
it just.

2594
01:46:37,670 --> 01:46:38,810
Well,
you know what man,

2595
01:46:38,900 --> 01:46:42,080
ultimately outside of you guys competing
against each other,

2596
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:46,760
you admire what [inaudible] you uniquely
know what it takes to be in the position

2597
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,460
that pedis or Hoffeld dos Anjos,
Nate Diaz or you know,

2598
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:51,770
fill in the blank.
All those guys.

2599
01:46:51,771 --> 01:46:53,960
You uniquely know what it takes to be an
easy.

2600
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:59,120
It's a very small fraternity of guys at 
the elite level and your division 1:55

2601
01:47:00,121 --> 01:47:02,610
is just chaos.
Like that whole division.

2602
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:03,360
He's like,
look at it.

2603
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:05,400
It's just killer after killer after 
killer.

2604
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,950
Absolutely.
There's coming up fucking sharks.

2605
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:14,420
That's a 1:55
is like someone throwing a goat in the 

2606
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:15,360
water in South Africa and once in a sea 
of sharks get it.

2607
01:47:15,660 --> 01:47:16,830
Yeah.
I mean it's.

2608
01:47:16,980 --> 01:47:19,260
So,
it's cool to see that you guys,

2609
01:47:19,261 --> 01:47:21,930
you know,
reasonably are friendly with each other.

2610
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:26,960
Absolutely.
Considering considering considering you 

2611
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,150
know anything about your boy Irish,
the Irish mbit coming up to 1:55,

2612
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:33,140
conor mcgregor make negative.

2613
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:38,590
What did you say about him?
About kicking the lucky charms out of 

2614
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:41,211
his house?
He came up the one of the develop 

2615
01:47:41,211 --> 01:47:41,211
bending over and fucking knocked the 
lucky charms out his ass.

2616
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:43,920
Don't know how that works.
It's like blowing on a hot soup,

2617
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:48,930
but you knew you wouldn't believe the 
uproar of the Irish community I got from

2618
01:47:48,931 --> 01:47:50,910
that.
When I said be silent,

2619
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:54,550
I'd be more shocked or respond.
Be like,

2620
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,810
I can talk about a Leprechaun.
Right?

2621
01:47:58,170 --> 01:48:00,960
Is like you talking to me bad about 
Santa Claus,

2622
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:02,130
like I wouldn't like,
oh,

2623
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,150
oh you,
oh,

2624
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:06,990
you went there like come on.
You know what I mean?

2625
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:10,010
Is their sacred guy.
It's like a Unicorn.

2626
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:11,460
Yeah.
I don't know what it is,

2627
01:48:11,461 --> 01:48:13,410
but a Leprechaun is.
It's a weird one,

2628
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,660
but it's totally as well.
It is.

2629
01:48:15,661 --> 01:48:17,400
Unless you take the right amount of 
mushrooms,

2630
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:19,070
you can meet leprechauns.

2631
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:20,130
So I,
I mean,

2632
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:25,820
to me that's where it came from.
Connor is the leprechauns sitting on a 

2633
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:30,080
big old tub of gold.
He is not a gold for sure if you think 

2634
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:30,690
I'm not going to come out of that pot of
gold.

2635
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,900
Why not 35?
I got open arms,

2636
01:48:33,901 --> 01:48:35,370
baby.
It would be a fun fight.

2637
01:48:35,460 --> 01:48:38,640
I'd love it.
I think he really struggles to make 1:45

2638
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,240
and I think with this new law where you 
can't use the ivy,

2639
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:44,730
you know when he fought Chad Mendez man 
at the way in,

2640
01:48:44,731 --> 01:48:48,000
he looked extremely drawn.
His cheeks were sucked in.

2641
01:48:48,001 --> 01:48:50,280
His body looked really small.
Like you're Ryan.

2642
01:48:50,281 --> 01:48:55,281
Him had some weird little altercation in
the hallway and it wasn't staged,

2643
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:00,770
but you're right is not like he didn't 
want to fight in the street with them 

2644
01:49:00,770 --> 01:49:01,950
right before he's going on Chad who wish
a motherfucker would.

2645
01:49:01,980 --> 01:49:03,540
I know you do,
but.

2646
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:07,770
But what you had said was that he's.
He said duty feels really small.

2647
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:12,830
Like he loses a lot of weight.
He loses like close to 30 pounds or 25 

2648
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:13,830
pounds.
He gets up to like one,

2649
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:17,570
seven d and the normal in the 70 range.
So 1:55

2650
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:18,720
was worried.
Belongs really,

2651
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:23,860
you know,
that's the probably the healthy weight 

2652
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:23,860
class for them and how you feel about 
all doing him.

2653
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:25,780
It's wild fight.
It's a wild wildfire,

2654
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:28,050
you know,
I'll tell you,

2655
01:49:28,051 --> 01:49:29,040
I tell you what,
man,

2656
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:33,960
I'm Aldo has been jumping,
jumping,

2657
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:36,570
jumping in.
They were jumping from guns.

2658
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:39,830
Did Religion de pree vehicle did.
We're just talking.

2659
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,540
That's how it goes.
We're jumping.

2660
01:49:41,580 --> 01:49:45,340
This isn't like a radio show.
Kangaroo fucking Australia and con.

2661
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:46,920
Yeah.
Fucking the whole thing,

2662
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:49,350
man.
Budweiser where we'd,

2663
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:52,530
um,
I think if you can come down.

2664
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:54,850
Did you lock the fucking door counts out
there?

2665
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:59,850
Yeah,
I'm going to get it because you have to 

2666
01:49:59,850 --> 01:49:59,850
right now.
Is it really Jamie?

2667
01:49:59,850 --> 01:49:59,850
I'll go again.
I said I'm locked out.

2668
01:49:59,850 --> 01:49:59,860
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2669
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:01,230
Tell them we're coming.
Yeah,

2670
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:02,910
don't worry.
I love this dude.

2671
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:05,190
I'll give him a key shit that he's done 
a,

2672
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,930
he's done podcasts here without me.
It's one of the few guys,

2673
01:50:07,931 --> 01:50:10,480
him and branded shop.
They had a fight companion podcast.

2674
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:12,750
But um,
we'll,

2675
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,840
we'll,
we're just saying what the fuck were we 

2676
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:17,840
just talking and talking about 
leprechauns.

2677
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:17,840
Oh No,
the Aldo fight.

2678
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:22,710
Oh look sexy.
Brian Cowen,

2679
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:26,260
it's just unexpectedly showed up.
We have a big show tonight.

2680
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,400
I will.
We were good man.

2681
01:50:30,401 --> 01:50:31,600
We'll leave here like,
you know,

2682
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:35,170
half an hour.
So fantastic show.

2683
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,030
Can't start without us.
Look at this.

2684
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:40,810
Tomorrow we're doing a.
The Ventura.

2685
01:50:40,811 --> 01:50:41,860
What is it?
The Hong Kong.

2686
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:44,050
We're going to be at the Hong Kong and 
we've got two shows at 8:00

2687
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:44,590
and 10:00.

2688
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:46,180
I think we're headlining the festival or
something.

2689
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:50,030
There's a Chinese restaurant festival.
Venture.

2690
01:50:50,031 --> 01:50:52,700
A comedy festival.
You didn't even know you booked this.

2691
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:55,660
I let him book things.
Not Money now.

2692
01:50:55,850 --> 01:50:58,390
They pay US money.
What's going on?

2693
01:50:58,391 --> 01:51:01,070
But just thinking about Aldo versus 
mcgregor.

2694
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:02,540
We're talking about,
uh,

2695
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:04,300
he asked me what I thought about that 
fight.

2696
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:05,920
Yeah.
I,

2697
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:06,910
uh,
I'm curious.

2698
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,800
I'm curious about the sexy cow in the 
hammer.

2699
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:10,570
Sexy Cowen.
The Hammer.

2700
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:13,840
What do you mean you made the account?
What's the structure?

2701
01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:17,050
You're going to hammer nothing of drunk.
It's a little bit.

2702
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:19,240
It's code.
It's just a little boost.

2703
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:21,400
Wait,
I want to know what do you think?

2704
01:51:21,401 --> 01:51:22,450
I think I think,
uh,

2705
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:24,610
is in his head.
He might be,

2706
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:27,760
but he might not be all that might be 
able to fight like a fucking assassin,

2707
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:31,060
even under all the shit talking.
No one's ever talked to before,

2708
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:31,780
so we don't know.

2709
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:36,960
We don't know how it's going to fight,
but we know that guy hasn't lost in 10 

2710
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:36,960
years if he,
if the guy's been beaten,

2711
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,490
some of the best guys in the world and 
if you look at him when he's on point,

2712
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:42,520
you look at it like his fight with Uriah
for instance.

2713
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:45,940
Some fucking terrifying leg kicks.
Fast Shit.

2714
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,020
Yeah.
Fastest Shit.

2715
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:51,760
And his Jujitsu world class,
his Jujitsu is very high level.

2716
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:55,480
You know,
he'd be Brina in regular Jujitsu,

2717
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:57,820
irregular Jujitsu competition.
He's a beast.

2718
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,860
He's a.
he's a very good fighter.

2719
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:03,250
That all aspects one of the best ever.
I feel like he's in his head.

2720
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:08,140
I know that trash talk wouldn't work on,
but we were talking about that earlier.

2721
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:10,340
You're coming in too late for this 
conversation you're talking about.

2722
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:14,410
He went over to talking about the nate 
Diaz fight were jumpers here.

2723
01:52:14,420 --> 01:52:16,550
We would travel,
travel,

2724
01:52:16,810 --> 01:52:21,810
travel.
I like it to go and it's a great fight 

2725
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:22,480
and.
But you gotta also,

2726
01:52:22,481 --> 01:52:27,481
I gotta be honest.
Like I look at Aldo and even though all 

2727
01:52:27,481 --> 01:52:28,570
those been dominant for so long,
it's one of the best fighters.

2728
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:29,950
He's,
he's,

2729
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:33,640
he's had a lot of tough fights.
Those eventually will catch up to you.

2730
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:37,390
It's like the Chad Mendez fight.
The last fight was a really good fight.

2731
01:52:37,610 --> 01:52:41,680
It was like a back and forth fight and 
Mendez hit him with some fucking bombs.

2732
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:46,100
It was a great back and forth fight and 
he tagged Mendez with a big shot at

2733
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:51,100
the end of the first round.
I think the Buzzer rang and then he hit 

2734
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:51,100
him like a.
It was a little late,

2735
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:55,720
wasn't agregious,
was a little late and at fuck Mendez up 

2736
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:55,720
and Mendez still came back and cracked 
them.

2737
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:58,340
It was a back and forth war.
It was a very close fight.

2738
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:03,400
Has although fought anyone who hits as 
hard as Mcgregor Co.

2739
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:05,960
Well Chad mendez hits pretty fucking 
hard.

2740
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:10,160
Um,
but I think connor may have some special

2741
01:53:10,161 --> 01:53:12,500
poWer.
Not like a magic power,

2742
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,090
but I think he's one of those guys that 
just really as super heavy hand.

2743
01:53:16,091 --> 01:53:19,640
It's so aCcurate is very.
he's just very smart man.

2744
01:53:19,641 --> 01:53:21,950
The way he fights is very,
very intelligent.

2745
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:27,220
You know,
I was joking around with donald about 

2746
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,220
his training Methods that he calls it.
Him and john.

2747
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:27,310
Kevin.
I was coast.

2748
01:53:27,460 --> 01:53:32,460
They,
they described it as upgrading your 

2749
01:53:32,460 --> 01:53:32,460
software without damaging your hardware.

2750
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:37,630
So they're doing all these like really 
technical drills on hitting specific 

2751
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:37,630
points,
but they're not like crushing each other

2752
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:39,470
to just drilling it into the mind and 
getting.

2753
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:44,890
And you know,
and donald has more of a wild style 

2754
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:47,480
who's out there.
I feel like donald's changed.

2755
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:49,640
I feel like you stand in people's grill 
more now.

2756
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:51,710
You just stand right there.
Like you can give a shit.

2757
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:54,280
My two of my favorite comedians in one 
fucking room,

2758
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:59,310
I'm like,
people will kill for this situation 

2759
01:53:59,310 --> 01:53:59,310
right now.
Donald's.

2760
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:00,140
Ronnie was in the crowd when I tape my 
comedy central special in denver.

2761
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:01,460
Well,
the first time I met donald,

2762
01:54:01,461 --> 01:54:02,780
he came.
I met him the night before.

2763
01:54:02,781 --> 01:54:06,800
Then he came and I just saw his hat 
going back and forth as he was laughing.

2764
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:11,990
I just saw your hat.
It was the greatest impact after I left 

2765
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:11,990
joe.

2766
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,920
Joe,
you know what I'm gonna do for you?

2767
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,770
What are you gonna do with fucking vct 
and you're fucking bathroom in there.

2768
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:19,310
Vct is that shitty cheap tile you got in
there.

2769
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:24,670
The tile on the floor.
On the floor and in the shitty paint 

2770
01:54:24,670 --> 01:54:24,770
brush,
but this is this like a lease.

2771
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:28,090
I'm going to come in here and fuck.
I'm not going to pull a permit and I'm a

2772
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:31,760
fucking.
Don't just kind of lay a towel.

2773
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:35,390
I might bite the tile to cut it.
That's great.

2774
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:36,950
I'm getting a new spot.
New spot.

2775
01:54:37,110 --> 01:54:37,980
It's a spot.
Yeah.

2776
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:39,860
I'm bringing.
I'm never satisfied.

2777
01:54:39,861 --> 01:54:42,110
I have real problems.
Never happy with it.

2778
01:54:42,111 --> 01:54:44,200
No,
I think that's the same way.

2779
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,460
I don't know if I don't know what it.
Is it worse than me.

2780
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,290
I'm the worst,
like if I'm always moving,

2781
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:52,580
almost happy with everything.
Unhappy with everything I do.

2782
01:54:53,110 --> 01:54:54,020
Yeah.
I'm always that way.

2783
01:54:54,021 --> 01:54:56,350
The other bumping with the wolf.
No,

2784
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:58,400
that's a great a werewolf.
Fucking a gorilla.

2785
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,980
Exactly.
I got it.

2786
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:03,200
I had a dream.
I wish I knew the dirty will make that.

2787
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,120
That's.
I hope you how the moon.

2788
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:10,121
Every time of year in that position 
woman,

2789
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:12,650
if you could grab the back of her 
shoulders like that.

2790
01:55:12,680 --> 01:55:16,040
Either have a whopper of a dick or.
That's a big one.

2791
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,610
I had an affair with a girl who was on 
the canadian national water polo team.

2792
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:26,870
Oh jesus.
She had a back on her and she had a neck

2793
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:31,900
and she.
But she had a really nice body and she 

2794
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,000
was really pretty.
And her hands.

2795
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:37,600
Go ahead man.
You're not even drinking the damn her 

2796
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,451
hands.
But what threw me off with just the 

2797
01:55:40,451 --> 01:55:40,670
thickness of her fingers as we would 
hold hands.

2798
01:55:40,671 --> 01:55:41,440
I was like,
whoa.

2799
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:46,720
I feel like I feel like a young lady.
Do you know gabby garcia is so is your 

2800
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:52,880
dick look shamelessly tiny in her hands.
Her take was way bigger than mine.

2801
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:56,170
I got a hug on me.
Um,

2802
01:55:56,310 --> 01:56:01,310
there was a,
there's a woman named gabby garcia is 

2803
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:03,651
still is,
but she used to be overweight and she's 

2804
01:56:03,651 --> 01:56:04,650
like world jujitsu champion and she used
to try this giant crazy face.

2805
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,800
Well she lost all her body fat and then 
I guess she might've had some facial 

2806
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:14,181
surgery,
but all of a sudden she's a giant hot 

2807
01:56:14,181 --> 01:56:14,181
chick.
It's real weird.

2808
01:56:14,181 --> 01:56:16,810
She's got full six pack,
like pull up gabby guard for.

2809
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,750
And I've seen her before.
Listen,

2810
01:56:18,870 --> 01:56:20,490
she was,
I don't know what she did,

2811
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:24,260
but whatever she did that took a lot of 
fucking work because she like,

2812
01:56:24,570 --> 01:56:29,570
became like she went from being a big 
giant fat woman who's a beast that hugh 

2813
01:56:30,391 --> 01:56:35,391
jitsu.
But she was very overweight to be super 

2814
01:56:35,391 --> 01:56:37,971
slim.
Like she always has these exposed 

2815
01:56:37,971 --> 01:56:38,530
midriff shirts and she's rocking this 
fucking ridiculous six pack.

2816
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:40,230
She's,
she's just 64.

2817
01:56:41,430 --> 01:56:42,420
Slaac yeah,
Johnny Cash.

2818
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:45,810
My dog's named johnny can jump in.
We're jumping in.

2819
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,790
You spend most your time.
Colorado,

2820
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:49,950
New Mexico,
bUt I go see.

2821
01:56:49,951 --> 01:56:52,290
I'm going to see grandma tomorrow.
She's listening in live right now.

2822
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:53,610
Tell her hello?
Hey grandma.

2823
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:58,590
Grandma.
Hey grandma.

2824
01:56:58,680 --> 01:57:02,690
How she gave me,
so I grabbed it.

2825
01:57:02,691 --> 01:57:04,390
Comes back today,
so this is what she looks like.

2826
01:57:04,690 --> 01:57:08,190
That's what she used to look lIke.
that's impressive as hell as a different

2827
01:57:08,191 --> 01:57:09,030
person.
Yeah,

2828
01:57:09,031 --> 01:57:10,280
totally.
Looks like a different person.

2829
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:14,520
The neck and the other one.
I don't know if she had facial surgery,

2830
01:57:14,521 --> 01:57:16,110
but it seems like she does.
She is.

2831
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:19,050
She is just a true specimen.
Look at that.

2832
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:21,120
That's crazy.
It's weird.

2833
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,800
You would.
She's giant too.

2834
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:25,980
I mean she's like six foot four,
like there's a picture of her with fader

2835
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:28,050
and it's like,
holy fuck.

2836
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:30,450
She's so much bigger than.
I'm looking at her now.

2837
01:57:30,451 --> 01:57:35,451
See if you find a picture of a gabby 
garcia and fate or it's like a real 

2838
01:57:35,451 --> 01:57:36,600
recent portion.
vandelay silva.

2839
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:43,100
Yeah.
That was when they were on the ultimate 

2840
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:43,100
fighter Brazil,
but here's the thing.

2841
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:44,340
It looks like she want him in a corner.
I was only a couple of years ago,

2842
01:57:44,341 --> 01:57:45,510
dude.
It wasn't.

2843
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:50,511
That wasn't that long ago.
It was really simple or really similar 

2844
01:57:50,511 --> 01:57:52,830
or recent.
How many beers have you had?

2845
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:55,200
About a few.
Far right far right.

2846
01:57:57,420 --> 01:57:58,560
look at that.
That's her.

2847
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:00,300
Look at her body.
Look at donald.

2848
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:03,330
Yeah,
that's a big growth.

2849
01:58:03,331 --> 01:58:04,730
That her boyfriend.
That's fader.

2850
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,730
That's fate or dude there,
that federal boyfriend here.

2851
01:58:07,731 --> 01:58:10,710
He's looking good flies back.
He's making a comeback.

2852
01:58:10,711 --> 01:58:15,711
He's gonna fight in Japan.
The problem is there's no fucking 

2853
01:58:15,711 --> 01:58:16,080
opponents for them.
I mean there's.

2854
01:58:16,110 --> 01:58:18,610
I don't know how the hell else is like 
surrogate cart.

2855
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:23,810
I'll fight them.
Surrogate kerataN on time with the kid 

2856
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:26,640
and in fact hitting dodgeville and he 
picked me.

2857
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,800
How much time would you need to fight 
fader morrow?

2858
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:31,410
He's amazing.
One hundred percent.

2859
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:34,920
You just walked in right now through the
fucking eight.

2860
01:58:34,921 --> 01:58:36,600
Getting fucked by a werewolf on the 
ground.

2861
01:58:36,601 --> 01:58:38,970
I'll get fuck bait or not a doubt in my 
mind.

2862
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:40,830
He.
You just fight him.

2863
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:46,410
I'm scared of russians.
I'll say it right now because of isis 

2864
01:58:46,410 --> 01:58:47,650
for everything.
I see this new thing with putin.

2865
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:50,230
Putin took $15,
billion dollars from this guy.

2866
01:58:50,470 --> 01:58:52,180
Took this guy,
stole this guy's company,

2867
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:55,210
and then the guys exiled in the south of
France and now he's.

2868
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:57,920
He's suing the russian government.
He says,

2869
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,120
good luck.
Good luck with this guy.

2870
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:03,750
Took $15,000,000,000.
He was like,

2871
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:08,140
putIn's banker,
putin's right hand man for years and now

2872
01:59:08,141 --> 01:59:11,230
this guy is like penniless,
penniless,

2873
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:14,320
and the guy say a billion seconds is 33 
years.

2874
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:16,960
The guy says that putin is the most 
wealthy man in the world.

2875
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:20,950
He said he has more control over more 
money than anyone on the planet.

2876
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,040
Like you might not be on paper,
but they're.

2877
01:59:23,041 --> 01:59:28,041
They're saying that he might be worth 
like 200 billion because Russia is one 

2878
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:29,560
crop economy.
It's all oil.

2879
01:59:29,630 --> 01:59:31,510
Guess who controls it?
You don't do anything without that.

2880
01:59:31,690 --> 01:59:33,280
He's a sako.
How is he doing?

2881
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:35,110
Russians?
Politics has always been that way.

2882
01:59:35,110 --> 01:59:40,110
It's always been run by azhar.
It's always been run really by a group 

2883
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:40,110
of,
you know,

2884
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:44,340
used to be the pull up bureau,
but for the most part he's just doing 

2885
01:59:44,340 --> 01:59:47,161
what the old russian model was,
which was get the biggest guns and 

2886
01:59:47,161 --> 01:59:50,780
killing what I mean,
isn't it a crazy when you see a guy 

2887
01:59:50,780 --> 01:59:55,621
who's running like essentially a 
complete undercover gangster 

2888
01:59:55,621 --> 01:59:55,730
organisation?
Monarchy.

2889
01:59:55,900 --> 01:59:57,580
Yeah.
Dominating entire country.

2890
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:59,140
He,
he apparently,

2891
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:02,470
when they were trying to attract 
investment in the nineties,

2892
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:07,770
the problem was american companies,
german companies or french companies 

2893
02:00:07,770 --> 02:00:10,180
coming in and these gangsters,
these russian guys would come in and go,

2894
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:11,920
hey,
you got to pay us money.

2895
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:17,220
And couple of them said no,
and they just shot him right there in 

2896
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:17,220
the office.
So putting inside of this was gonna be a

2897
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:19,060
disaster for any kind of foreign 
investment.

2898
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,060
So putin said,
alright,

2899
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:22,450
well I know how to deal with this.

2900
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:27,480
We know exactly where they are and when 
they were having big guys hanging out 

2901
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:27,970
together in their own club houses or 
whatever,

2902
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,610
he had these spetsnaz guys show up in 
their,

2903
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:35,850
in their vans.
They just show up in the middle of the 

2904
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:37,980
day,
open up and just killed a shitload of 

2905
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:37,980
them,
like 100,

2906
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,520
201 day they had a moment of silence.
Apparently before he had his,

2907
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:41,200
uh,
before he had his,

2908
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:41,950
his,
uh,

2909
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:42,940
whatever it was,
you know,

2910
02:00:42,941 --> 02:00:47,941
his meeting,
they had a moment of silence for up to 

2911
02:00:47,941 --> 02:00:48,370
200 citizens that were killed and they 
won their business.

2912
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:53,550
And that was the message to anybody who 
saId you want to shake that foreign 

2913
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:53,550
company.
See what the fuck happens.

2914
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:54,920
They still didn't invest though.
But he's.

2915
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:56,010
He doesn't.
He doesn't.

2916
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:58,900
He doesn't.
Dogs running a fight on tomorrow.

2917
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:01,000
Tomorrow.
Tonight.

2918
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:03,640
He's a black belt in judo.
However,

2919
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:07,410
I'm hear everything in the hood.

2920
02:01:07,890 --> 02:01:09,640
Everyone's from a street.
I hate that expression.

2921
02:01:09,641 --> 02:01:14,641
Donald,
if you had to fight straight and who's 

2922
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:14,641
not from the street?
I was born in the metal.

2923
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:14,641
Are you?
I wasn't.

2924
02:01:14,641 --> 02:01:15,580
I'm not from the street.
Alex.

2925
02:01:15,581 --> 02:01:18,560
I'm looking for the silver spoon in my 
mouth and just no role.

2926
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:21,220
I'm in.
I'm in the forest.

2927
02:01:21,221 --> 02:01:23,620
Who do you want to punch in the face 
more than anybody on the planet.

2928
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,870
Are you interviewing them around?
My man.

2929
02:01:25,871 --> 02:01:28,220
I'm taking.
I'm taking over the guy from wholefoods.

2930
02:01:28,330 --> 02:01:33,330
Shitty fucking question questions.
The guy from whole foods.

2931
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:37,150
It was a previous story because it got 
punched him foods.

2932
02:01:37,210 --> 02:01:40,040
Parking lot.
Fucking late.

2933
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,330
He told me that story.
WHat did you.

2934
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,730
What made you decide to come over here?
He was texting me.

2935
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:48,940
Oh,
why don't you tell him if you were 

2936
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:48,940
texting him,
like be more appealing to have three.

2937
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:54,800
Well,
why don't you use our people in the 

2938
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:54,800
world?

2939
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:54,800
He's one of my favorite people.
Do.

2940
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:58,300
He just had a break.
He's making secret text while we're in 

2941
02:01:58,300 --> 02:01:58,300
the middle of a pop lovers.
He's called.

2942
02:01:58,300 --> 02:02:03,060
Come on over this garden.
Said the door's locked in.

2943
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,370
I'm locked out.
you want to key you gonna have a kid.

2944
02:02:06,371 --> 02:02:07,020
That's right.
Yeah.

2945
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:08,720
Okay.
Just to hang out.

2946
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:11,550
Sure.
Where we'll market.

2947
02:02:12,170 --> 02:02:13,900
The people know about the bad ass 
werewolf.

2948
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:14,760
Vfl side.
Yeah.

2949
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:20,200
There's pictures of it.
It used to be before I got the pool 

2950
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:20,200
table used to be.
The werewolf was the first thing you saw

2951
02:02:20,200 --> 02:02:22,360
when you opened the door and I was like,
I need to put a goat cam.

2952
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:24,760
That was the first thing I saw when I 
came in.

2953
02:02:24,790 --> 02:02:27,650
I was like,
werewolf pool pools day.

2954
02:02:29,770 --> 02:02:31,010
Do you play pool?
You musT play.

2955
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:33,110
I do have a pool table in the bar at the
ranch.

2956
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:38,560
Have a bar that I built but you.
I have every alcohol you could ever 

2957
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,090
believe of,
but because I don't want someone to come

2958
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:41,620
borrow.
yeah.

2959
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:43,040
Kegs,
boxes,

2960
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:48,070
cases.
I don't want to come over and take over 

2961
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:48,370
for me this and I don't have it damn 
gangster.

2962
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:53,680
This is,
this gets you psychologically because I 

2963
02:02:53,680 --> 02:02:55,080
know your background,
like how you grew up and you're like,

2964
02:02:55,120 --> 02:03:00,120
you're creating like this environment at
that ranch that's not just like a 

2965
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:01,850
training environment,
but a place where like,

2966
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:06,851
you're,
you're trying to give these guys 

2967
02:03:06,851 --> 02:03:06,851
hospitality and bring them into like a 
family situation.

2968
02:03:06,851 --> 02:03:11,210
Like I'm never in ranch that we're 
neverland.

2969
02:03:12,850 --> 02:03:15,520
Fuck,
we're a bunch of boys coming to hang out

2970
02:03:15,550 --> 02:03:18,230
as much.
Not as much.

2971
02:03:18,430 --> 02:03:20,220
Jared is what they're calling it today.

2972
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:21,990
Not as much boy play.
Yeah.

2973
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:22,880
How about turn?
Yeah.

2974
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,860
So yeah,
but you know what I'm saying.

2975
02:03:24,890 --> 02:03:29,890
It's like because You know your,
your grandparents raIsed you and you 

2976
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:32,720
were wild kid and you know,
he didn't feel like you've had like that

2977
02:03:32,721 --> 02:03:35,900
thing we were talking earlier about 
trainers that wouldn't put their name on

2978
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:40,910
it.
Now you're doing the total opposite of 

2979
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:40,910
that.
The total opposite.

2980
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:42,890
Absolutely.
I appreciate that man.

2981
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:45,970
Absolutely.
The total opposite and yeah,

2982
02:03:45,971 --> 02:03:47,610
if guys calling me like have they can 
afford it,

2983
02:03:47,620 --> 02:03:48,740
said don't worry about it.
I got you.

2984
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:54,400
Go ahead.
So what do you do that with the ranch 

2985
02:03:55,810 --> 02:03:58,400
ranch?
Grandpa bought some property.

2986
02:03:58,401 --> 02:04:00,770
Happiest moment is life.
Tears almost came to his side during the

2987
02:04:00,771 --> 02:04:03,320
podcast builds a place,
doesn't get permits.

2988
02:04:03,321 --> 02:04:06,100
Fucks up because he has the bunk bed set
up.

2989
02:04:06,101 --> 02:04:07,630
Oh shit.
Now what do we do now?

2990
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:10,190
Sleeping in a barn.
A key propane.

2991
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:12,590
If you keep the propane on it costs 1500
bucks a night.

2992
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:14,990
This is a lot of work.
You're learning all this stuff.

2993
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:16,610
He doesn't have any power out there,
man.

2994
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:20,840
He's getting tanks of flammable liquid.
Any shooting guns everywhere.

2995
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:23,750
The whole thing is ridiculous.
He shows me all these guns.

2996
02:04:23,751 --> 02:04:26,330
He's got gun.
Shoot a propane tank with a gun.

2997
02:04:26,331 --> 02:04:27,740
It will not blow up.
Is that true?

2998
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:30,550
Absolutely true.
In the movies.

2999
02:04:30,610 --> 02:04:32,760
It will not blow up though.
I had a navy seal hammer.

3000
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:35,120
When you throw a grenade it doesn't.
There's no fire.

3001
02:04:35,121 --> 02:04:37,770
It just.
You just hear pop and there's no.

3002
02:04:37,830 --> 02:04:38,730
Yeah,
just smoke.

3003
02:04:38,910 --> 02:04:40,470
Which I was amazed at.
Well,

3004
02:04:40,471 --> 02:04:42,840
that's annoying.
What about to chuck norris movies?

3005
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:47,841
Where there was an explosion?
Is chuck norris still the coolest dude 

3006
02:04:47,841 --> 02:04:47,841
alive or.
No?

3007
02:04:47,841 --> 02:04:49,680
I met him and I was more happy than I've
been when I met anybody.

3008
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:52,300
Ever inexpensive manner.
Great job.

3009
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:55,370
First time I was very happy.
Chris.

3010
02:04:58,110 --> 02:05:03,110
He can be public anD a bar instead of in
a fucking hotel room with a 14 year old 

3011
02:05:07,290 --> 02:05:08,570
chuck norris.
Um,

3012
02:05:08,580 --> 02:05:10,440
I met him into world combat league 
member.

3013
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:12,240
Used to have that kickboxing 
organization,

3014
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:13,950
that dome audit,
a bowl bowl.

3015
02:05:14,630 --> 02:05:19,630
I met him there and just the fact that 
chuck norris knew who I was and gave me 

3016
02:05:19,630 --> 02:05:20,090
a big hug.
I was like god damn.

3017
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:22,060
And put his boot up to your face.
Black bottom of,

3018
02:05:22,150 --> 02:05:27,150
let's say he had crushed things.
Kickboxing fans,

3019
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:29,980
the Texas ranger mother fucking remember
super foot.

3020
02:05:29,990 --> 02:05:34,990
Wallace used to have jeans that he 
advertised in like the back of comic 

3021
02:05:34,990 --> 02:05:34,990
books.
Yeah,

3022
02:05:34,990 --> 02:05:35,940
we'll chuck norris did to chuck.
Not chuck norris,

3023
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:40,941
I think more than she requested posters 
of bad ass shit that you have to think 

3024
02:05:42,961 --> 02:05:45,840
about if your life is that cool.
Chuck norris,

3025
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:47,730
he's a super nice guy.
Too many.

3026
02:05:47,930 --> 02:05:48,810
It was a uh,
yeah,

3027
02:05:48,811 --> 02:05:50,370
there was a,
there was a thing,

3028
02:05:50,371 --> 02:05:55,371
a banquet for a karate guy who was a 
famous karate instructor and he was one 

3029
02:05:55,421 --> 02:05:58,140
of the truck norris's friends.
So I sat in on the.

3030
02:05:58,170 --> 02:06:00,840
They wanted me to sit and like give,
give a speech.

3031
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:05,930
like everybody gave speeches,
like all these old school black belt 

3032
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:05,930
guys gave speeches at chuck norris gave 
a speech.

3033
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:08,250
I just sat next to cHuck norris and talk
for like an hour and a half.

3034
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:13,580
We just talked about the old days of the
karate tournament and the old days of 

3035
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:18,321
kickboxing.
And you know what it was like to hang 

3036
02:06:18,321 --> 02:06:21,231
out with Bruce Lee.
It was one of the best moments of my 

3037
02:06:21,231 --> 02:06:21,231
life.
You didn't hit him with any chuck norris

3038
02:06:21,231 --> 02:06:22,860
lines like chuck norris doesn't do 
pushups.

3039
02:06:22,861 --> 02:06:27,800
He pushes the earth away from him.
How many of them?

3040
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:28,320
You know what?

3041
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:31,200
Why not even like an opening line?
I Just knew.

3042
02:06:31,201 --> 02:06:36,201
First of all,
how many times do you ever get a chance 

3043
02:06:36,201 --> 02:06:37,260
to sit and actually right next to chuck 
norris in a public setting?

3044
02:06:37,660 --> 02:06:42,660
This moment right here,
that's how I feel at this moment right 

3045
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:42,660
now.
We feel the same way.

3046
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:44,070
I'm sitting next to him.
It was just me and him talKing,

3047
02:06:44,500 --> 02:06:49,500
you know,
just me and chuck norris right next to 

3048
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:49,500
each other.
So our.

3049
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:52,530
It was like a little kid I saw missing 
in action in the fucking movie theater,

3050
02:06:52,680 --> 02:06:53,880
lone wolf,
mcquade.

3051
02:06:53,881 --> 02:06:56,490
I was there for all those movies did.
I panicked.

3052
02:06:56,550 --> 02:06:59,910
I panicked two times with celebrities 
that I felt were really big.

3053
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:03,210
I met opera chino and I was talking to 
him and I was like,

3054
02:07:03,211 --> 02:07:03,990
just be cool,
be cool,

3055
02:07:03,991 --> 02:07:04,470
brian,
be cool,

3056
02:07:04,471 --> 02:07:06,990
be cool.
Don'T spazzed out sometimes.

3057
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:09,030
And are you looking at yourself from a 
third person?

3058
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:14,150
Kind of kind of more staring at him.
And I was just like,

3059
02:07:15,031 --> 02:07:17,940
he had a bandana on and he looked so 
cool and he was 70.

3060
02:07:18,570 --> 02:07:23,560
He looks amazing.
He's from New York.

3061
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:26,730
That's a good fucking.
I've never done it before.

3062
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,540
That's very good for.
Is that similar?

3063
02:07:28,950 --> 02:07:32,310
Like fucking I went like this and I got.
I can't kill myself.

3064
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:34,530
I,
I heard the words coming out of my mouth

3065
02:07:34,531 --> 02:07:35,070
and I was like,
brian,

3066
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,530
stop,
stop.

3067
02:07:35,531 --> 02:07:36,100
You're saying,
hey,

3068
02:07:36,101 --> 02:07:37,060
I go,
I go,

3069
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:38,890
you know,
it's funny.

3070
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:39,880
I get.
I'll say it again,

3071
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:40,790
don't say it,
and I sent it.

3072
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:45,810
I go,
I just watched scarface was on tv as 

3073
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:47,630
left he and he goes,
michael.

3074
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:48,740
I was like,
no.

3075
02:07:49,130 --> 02:07:50,640
I was like,
no.

3076
02:07:50,820 --> 02:07:54,370
My face was saying it and then I go.
I looked at him and he went like this.

3077
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:55,630
He goes,
oh boy,

3078
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:59,140
that's what you did.

3079
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:04,470
And he hugged me,
know he shook my hand and he put his 

3080
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:04,480
shoulder against my chest.
I was like,

3081
02:08:04,481 --> 02:08:09,481
oh,
that's the coolest way to ever do 

3082
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:09,481
anything.
And I was like,

3083
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:09,481
see you later.
Then.

3084
02:08:09,481 --> 02:08:12,730
Then I need springsteen backstage.
I talked to him for awhile.

3085
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:16,030
I talked to his wife.
I'm a huge bruce springsteen fan.

3086
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:21,150
Six months later with my dad in a 
bookstore in Idaho in sun valley,

3087
02:08:22,181 --> 02:08:25,660
Idaho.
And I hear his wife say,

3088
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:26,980
hi,
how are you?

3089
02:08:27,070 --> 02:08:28,120
I'm and I go,
oh,

3090
02:08:28,121 --> 02:08:30,220
patty,
hi.

3091
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:31,990
And she goes,
what are you doing?

3092
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:34,150
And I go,
how's bruce thinking?

3093
02:08:34,151 --> 02:08:36,000
I known them when I talked to him for 
like an hour.

3094
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:37,360
She goes,
ask him yourself.

3095
02:08:37,361 --> 02:08:38,550
He's right here,
and I turned.

3096
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:40,690
He's looking at a book I read called 
fiasco.

3097
02:08:40,691 --> 02:08:42,640
I remember he had his glasses on and I 
go,

3098
02:08:42,910 --> 02:08:44,050
how you doing?
and he goes,

3099
02:08:44,051 --> 02:08:44,650
I met you.

3100
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:48,300
We talked backstage and all of a sudden 
I realized my eyes.

3101
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:53,420
I folded my arms,
but for whatever reason my fucking arms 

3102
02:08:53,420 --> 02:08:58,320
were really high and my elbows were 
pointed right at him and in my mind I 

3103
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:58,320
was like,
brian,

3104
02:08:58,320 --> 02:08:58,570
please let go of your arms.
Don't do this.

3105
02:08:58,571 --> 02:08:59,680
What are you doing?
And I go,

3106
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:01,120
and this is what I did.
I go,

3107
02:09:01,330 --> 02:09:02,650
I go,
did you ski?

3108
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:04,810
And he goes,
usually we do,

3109
02:09:04,811 --> 02:09:07,270
but this year we just let the kids do it
and we're just sitting,

3110
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:12,600
you know.
And I went and I meant to say I fucking 

3111
02:09:12,600 --> 02:09:15,040
meant to say I've been skiing all day.
My feet are killing me and I'm not going

3112
02:09:15,041 --> 02:09:16,700
to ski anymore.
That's what I meant.

3113
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:18,220
Say,
I've been skiing all day.

3114
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:21,100
My boots are shitty.
I don't want to ski anymore.

3115
02:09:21,640 --> 02:09:24,310
And instead I went with my fucking arms 
like this,

3116
02:09:24,311 --> 02:09:26,380
I go,
my feet are killing me.

3117
02:09:27,520 --> 02:09:28,990
And he just looked at me and there was a
pause.

3118
02:09:28,991 --> 02:09:31,310
I go,
I'll see you guys later,

3119
02:09:31,311 --> 02:09:33,100
man.
And I kind of like fucking.

3120
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:35,200
And I've never lived that down.
I juSt felt exactly.

3121
02:09:35,201 --> 02:09:36,640
But I'm sure they deal with that shit 
all the time.

3122
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,510
Just holding myself like that.
Did you just have that same moment right

3123
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:42,280
now?
Like during this podcast?

3124
02:09:42,750 --> 02:09:44,230
I feel embarrassed right now.
What you're doing.

3125
02:09:44,231 --> 02:09:46,840
I feel embarrassed guys.
Get people wanting to take pictures that

3126
02:09:46,841 --> 02:09:49,590
are trembling out of fucking control.
Yeah,

3127
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:54,630
sometimes it happens.
I've had a lot of nervous moments in my 

3128
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:56,680
life.
I appreciate nerves to deal,

3129
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,660
you know,
I can't help nerves.

3130
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:03,690
The guy with the camera and he's like 
capable of fuck people.

3131
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:06,250
Fuck we go,
come on bitch.

3132
02:10:06,251 --> 02:10:11,080
What are you going to get?
An iphone son?

3133
02:10:11,130 --> 02:10:12,010
Yeah.
I fuck with them.

3134
02:10:12,011 --> 02:10:13,340
But I don't you deal with that.

3135
02:10:13,800 --> 02:10:18,800
So the greatest domestic disputes that 
you ever witnessed in your life is on a 

3136
02:10:18,971 --> 02:10:23,971
boat ramp.
I don't know if you guys have ever been 

3137
02:10:23,971 --> 02:10:25,621
on the boat ramp,
but either the wife is driving the boat 

3138
02:10:25,621 --> 02:10:26,010
and a husband and the pickup and he's 
trying to fucking guide.

3139
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:27,010
Ron left.
look.

3140
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,930
No,
she trying to snake the trailer down and

3141
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:35,570
he sitting in the boat screaming at her 
snake and the trailer down with 30 other

3142
02:10:35,571 --> 02:10:37,520
boats are trying to dock.
It's damn.

3143
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:39,830
Oh,
that's interesting though.

3144
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:41,000
Next time I'm there,
I'm gonna.

3145
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:43,310
I'm gonna.
Go because it is.

3146
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,780
You would.
I never thought of that.

3147
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:45,590
Oh,
it's unbelievable.

3148
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:47,210
I just thought the boats were always in 
the water.

3149
02:10:47,211 --> 02:10:51,140
Somehow been getting.
It's 4:30.

3150
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,900
They'd been drinking all day trying to 
get the fuck out.

3151
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:58,080
Messaging dispute happens in it is.
It's classic.

3152
02:10:58,150 --> 02:11:03,150
They say there and when and realtors,
realtors see a lot of dark shit between 

3153
02:11:03,531 --> 02:11:08,531
couples as they're looking for houses,
deciding what they want or they can't 

3154
02:11:08,531 --> 02:11:10,370
afford a fucking house,
but she wants the house.

3155
02:11:12,110 --> 02:11:13,880
She always wants it.
Dude.

3156
02:11:13,881 --> 02:11:18,881
I had a conversation with my buddy about
this recently who was talking about his 

3157
02:11:18,881 --> 02:11:20,900
girlfriend hates.
Where's the fucking stripper voice?

3158
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:25,901
She wants a fucking towel up it up.
What does that sound is stripped from 

3159
02:11:25,901 --> 02:11:26,740
interacting?
This is a.

3160
02:11:26,750 --> 02:11:29,870
I know a dude who's fucked and I feel 
bad.

3161
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:32,260
He's just bringing it toward dude is 
this.

3162
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:35,750
The girl wants him to live over his 
means,

3163
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:37,790
you know,
and it gets weird.

3164
02:11:37,791 --> 02:11:39,770
You know what she's like,
we need a better house.

3165
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:44,830
I need to.
We need to get a better house and he 

3166
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:44,830
can't really afford a better house.
So he's scrambling.

3167
02:11:44,830 --> 02:11:46,670
Well,
this a bad place to be.

3168
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,650
A woman I know is a realtor.
Said she was.

3169
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:52,130
They were looking at this house that was
like $6 a night in New York city.

3170
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:56,030
What happened for $6,000,000?
just about 1300 square feet.

3171
02:11:56,030 --> 02:11:56,900
Something crazy.
Yeah.

3172
02:11:56,910 --> 02:12:01,910
No yard.
And her friend had the ranch for 10 

3173
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:02,210
million from drawing.
Yeah.

3174
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:07,280
I mean it's crazy.
You can buy like nothing for you know 

3175
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:07,280
me.
Well he shoots guns in his yard,

3176
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:08,330
but off the fucking toilet.
That too.

3177
02:12:08,331 --> 02:12:13,331
We got to fucking new silencers.
I don't really get them sense rests on 

3178
02:12:13,331 --> 02:12:17,231
his toilet.
Just looking out the window in case a 

3179
02:12:17,231 --> 02:12:19,370
straight antelope games,
big games.

3180
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,100
I'm a birdman.
Yeah.

3181
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:23,240
Birdman,
birdman,

3182
02:12:23,241 --> 02:12:25,010
just any bird,
they insult you with their freedom.

3183
02:12:25,011 --> 02:12:26,740
Just poor.
I'm poor.

3184
02:12:28,020 --> 02:12:33,020
So she goes.
She was showing them the house and she 

3185
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:33,260
said,
I have another place.

3186
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:34,770
It's just a little too,
you know,

3187
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,140
it's a little bit out of your price 
range and it was $8,000,000

3188
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:42,160
and this girl's friend had a $10,000,000
house and she loved her husband and 

3189
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:45,251
went,
how could you fucking do this to us as 

3190
02:12:45,251 --> 02:12:45,251
in you don't have enough money.

3191
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:48,380
Got in And hale.
And he went.

3192
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:53,560
Instead of going cla later he went,
sorry about that man.

3193
02:12:54,081 --> 02:12:55,530
That's how people live sometimes.
Well,

3194
02:12:55,540 --> 02:13:00,540
that's people that if they don't have 
any other interests other than 

3195
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:02,330
materialistic things than you,
that's what you chase.

3196
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:07,360
Yes.
It is a real problem with that in this 

3197
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:08,891
fucking city is a real problem with 
people that are only chasing that and 

3198
02:13:08,891 --> 02:13:09,290
they're not looking at the big picture 
life.

3199
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:12,470
They're defining themselves by how much 
one of their houses cost,

3200
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:14,840
how much you know,
what neighborhood they're in,

3201
02:13:14,841 --> 02:13:19,841
what kinD of car they're driving.
all that stuff is them and there's no 

3202
02:13:19,841 --> 02:13:22,340
other stuff is no.
The looks in a comedy.

3203
02:13:22,341 --> 02:13:26,720
There's no society looks at that.
If you show up and you're living in your

3204
02:13:26,721 --> 02:13:31,721
school,
kids go to this school and you live in 

3205
02:13:31,721 --> 02:13:31,721
this area and you drive the range rover,
right?

3206
02:13:31,721 --> 02:13:35,370
That's your status.
I think that that term society,

3207
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:42,110
I think that's changing pretty well 
because of the internet people like 

3208
02:13:42,961 --> 02:13:47,961
there's going to be.
There's a bunch of people that don't 

3209
02:13:47,961 --> 02:13:48,300
think like that and now they can all 
agree.

3210
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:52,860
Whereas before what was put out in front
of you was what was on commercials.

3211
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:55,590
What was you saw the hero have in the 
movie?

3212
02:13:55,740 --> 02:14:00,740
Burt reynolds as a trans.
Am I fucking need a trans am like all 

3213
02:14:00,740 --> 02:14:04,401
that stuff was the only way we 
associated with ideas about items,

3214
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:08,490
but now because the internet,
you'll talk to people that go,

3215
02:14:08,491 --> 02:14:09,850
you know what man?
I don't.

3216
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:14,860
I live in a fucking trailer that drive 
around in my truck and I just go to 

3217
02:14:14,860 --> 02:14:15,630
different places and I climb mountains.
that's like that.

3218
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:17,770
Alex.
He lives in a van.

3219
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:20,070
Yeah,
but that's cool too.

3220
02:14:20,071 --> 02:14:21,960
And he'll find fans.

3221
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:23,880
The people that admire him because of 
that.

3222
02:14:24,040 --> 02:14:25,740
I know.
I think that like.

3223
02:14:25,741 --> 02:14:30,741
Yeah,
and I think that some people who chase 

3224
02:14:30,741 --> 02:14:30,741
money,
it has a lot of meaning.

3225
02:14:30,741 --> 02:14:31,530
Some people were humiliated by being 
poor when they were kids.

3226
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:33,750
Money.
It makes them feel powerful,

3227
02:14:33,751 --> 02:14:34,500
safe,
whatever.

3228
02:14:34,501 --> 02:14:37,920
But like I was thinking about,
I was trying to isolate of the two times

3229
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:42,921
I'm the most happy,
like the two things that mattereD to me 

3230
02:14:42,921 --> 02:14:43,620
the most with my friends and getting 
better at something.

3231
02:14:43,650 --> 02:14:45,080
I thought it was coming with a finger 
and you're,

3232
02:14:45,090 --> 02:14:50,090
it's coming with a finger up my ass.
Obviously when you check and you see an 

3233
02:14:52,381 --> 02:14:55,170
extra comma in your bank account,
you're not fucking just tickled pink.

3234
02:14:55,190 --> 02:14:58,050
I not really,
but I'm weird that way and he knows that

3235
02:14:58,051 --> 02:15:00,390
I'm just so weird.
He drives a fucking shitty car.

3236
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:03,690
Drives this goofy fucking volkswagen 
money.

3237
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:05,640
You could have something that you,
you drive,

3238
02:15:05,641 --> 02:15:10,641
it's a pleasure,
like you enjoy it and it changes your 

3239
02:15:10,641 --> 02:15:12,280
transportation to a ride at disneyland.
RIde every.

3240
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:17,330
I like getting better at something and 
being a silly goose with my friends and 

3241
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:18,450
a finger in my ass.
And if let's say we got to end this man,

3242
02:15:18,451 --> 02:15:20,850
we gotta we gotta show on that note.
And on that note,

3243
02:15:21,090 --> 02:15:23,910
donald motherfucking cowboy serone.
Thank you sir.

3244
02:15:24,310 --> 02:15:26,310
We did this at the same time.
you're in town,

3245
02:15:26,311 --> 02:15:27,390
man.
Look at the trifecta.

3246
02:15:27,391 --> 02:15:29,430
I'm sitting here and we can take it 
wherever we could.

3247
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:31,890
We could probably have about 100 days 
easily.

3248
02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:32,760
Easily.
We'll,

3249
02:15:32,761 --> 02:15:37,761
we'll see how the everyone racks and 
fucking love it if they get a couple 

3250
02:15:39,150 --> 02:15:42,600
hundred youtube comments.
I'm fucking get plenty of comments.

3251
02:15:42,630 --> 02:15:44,640
Look,
the most people are gonna.

3252
02:15:44,670 --> 02:15:45,890
Love it.
You got to separate.

3253
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:46,590
What does the bible say?

3254
02:15:46,590 --> 02:15:48,060
You got to separate the wheat from the 
chaff,

3255
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:49,960
the wheat from the chaff.
Yes.

3256
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:53,130
If you don't have a fucking sword,
go and get one sale your cloak and get a

3257
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:55,800
better one to zero with the bible says,
god damn it.

3258
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:58,420
They're selling swords in the bible.
Sell your cloak and gate.

3259
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:03,470
I don't remember that passage so close.
How pious donald is always making the 

3260
02:16:05,191 --> 02:16:06,810
cross.
I don't know if I'll ever own a cloak.

3261
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:08,550
I might go to the grave with no clothes 
on.

3262
02:16:08,551 --> 02:16:11,910
A cloak,
man didn't right now I need some dracula

3263
02:16:11,911 --> 02:16:16,911
club.
I want to own a lot of land and walk 

3264
02:16:16,911 --> 02:16:16,911
around in mY cloak.
Yeah,

3265
02:16:16,911 --> 02:16:18,020
and I want to and I want to just order 
my servants around me.

3266
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:23,060
Coconut,
two straws and some shaved ice pack 

3267
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:23,060
llamas.
Oh,

3268
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:27,090
I want to shoot animals in the woods.
I can bring the pack lambos and they'll 

3269
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:27,090
pack it out.

3270
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:30,760
That's good.
I want hamsters to feel in my hands.

3271
02:16:30,761 --> 02:16:35,761
Please.
I want a few Guinea pigs around the 

3272
02:16:35,761 --> 02:16:35,761
house just in case I need to eat them 
like the people do.

3273
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:39,070
They keep in the kitchen.
They're all scrambled around the kitchen

3274
02:16:39,260 --> 02:16:44,260
and grab what I need them.
I want them for petting and pressing 

3275
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:44,260
against my.
Janet apparentLy don't miss each other.

3276
02:16:44,680 --> 02:16:49,680
They never like where's waldo.
They don't give a fuck about waldo or 

3277
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:49,680
the peanuts out.
Yes,

3278
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:50,100
they're good.
They say cancer like that.

3279
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:51,640
Cats could give a fuck about their 
owners.

3280
02:16:51,820 --> 02:16:52,810
Well,
when their owners die,

3281
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:54,070
cats,
ether faces.

3282
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:55,330
Is that true?
You know that?

3283
02:16:55,331 --> 02:16:57,040
Yeah.
Big john Mccarthy was telling me that.

3284
02:16:57,220 --> 02:17:02,220
He said,
the worst thing you want to find is a 

3285
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:02,220
guy.
Guy's been dead for a couple of days and

3286
02:17:02,220 --> 02:17:02,400
he's had cats.
Yeah.

3287
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:05,260
The cats seat your face when you stopped
giving him cat food,

3288
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:06,130
they just started eating you.

3289
02:17:06,570 --> 02:17:08,170
Whoa.
Whoa.

3290
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:11,140
The your face your face for a long time 
too,

3291
02:17:11,141 --> 02:17:13,690
until you get really rotten and you get 
really rotten.

3292
02:17:13,930 --> 02:17:15,970
You're not there to feed them when 
they're hungry.

3293
02:17:16,510 --> 02:17:17,550
They don't.
They don't.

3294
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:20,260
Dog.
Your dog will fucking starve to death.

3295
02:17:20,350 --> 02:17:22,440
Most dogs maybe might be a cunt to your 
dog.

3296
02:17:22,441 --> 02:17:27,441
Your dog might eat youtube,
but most dogs will like sit there and 

3297
02:17:27,441 --> 02:17:27,441
they'll say,
yeah,

3298
02:17:27,441 --> 02:17:29,840
they want to wake up.
I have a fucking toward is that,

3299
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:31,390
but he's gonna live to be 100,
200 years old.

3300
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:32,870
Tourists are man eaters.
Yeah.

3301
02:17:33,020 --> 02:17:36,490
If you find the interface and facile 
first,

3302
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:38,610
you might wake up and you have no 
lasting.

3303
02:17:40,640 --> 02:17:41,950
They can cannot get their head.
So far,

3304
02:17:41,951 --> 02:17:45,200
just narcolepsy.
Don't eat my ass hole.

3305
02:17:45,410 --> 02:17:47,380
I'm fine.
You fucking shitty turtle.

3306
02:17:47,460 --> 02:17:52,460
They peak your asshole.
Can't they go a long time without food 

3307
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:52,460
to a.
I don't know.

3308
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:52,690
I know.
I'm so.

3309
02:17:52,691 --> 02:17:56,110
If I call it to come to the show 
tonight.

3310
02:17:56,470 --> 02:17:57,720
Fuck yeah,
dude.

3311
02:17:57,790 --> 02:17:59,590
Come to the show.
You can come for sure.

3312
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:01,610
Absolutely.
Come.

3313
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:06,780
Can I plug my date this weekend?

Florida.

motherfucking world.

3322
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:24,100
He made me,

3323
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:25,870
I'll be there.
I'll be there for my boyfriend.

3324

Going to be their best.
Do you want to do the gig with me the 

3325
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:31,410
night before?

3326
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:31,410
December 19th?
Yeah.

3327
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:32,990
What the night before is.
I'm doing again.

3328
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:39,330
Take advantage of Florida now.
And he does come and be the night 

3329
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:39,330
before.
Yeah.

3330
02:18:39,330 --> 02:18:44,280
It wasn't something.

3331
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:44,280
friday night so we'll do it over there.
Earlier.

3332
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,010
What do you get?
Nervous thinking about that date?

3333
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:47,000
Are you ready?
He's been ready.

3334
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:48,020
I wasn't ready.
Bitch.

3335
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:50,770
How dare you?
He's full of skull and budweiser's.

3336
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:56,210
Hurricane smashed him coming.
Donald said,

3337
02:18:56,480 --> 02:18:57,410
hey,

3338
02:18:58,300 --> 02:19:00,910
