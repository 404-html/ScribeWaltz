if you're stuck on a plane,
if you're on the bicycle,

10
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:44,001
just staring at a fucking stupid life 
cycle thing telling you you're not going

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:49,041
fast enough.
Books on tape are an amazing way to pass

12
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:54,561
time and Scott Sigler is with us today.
We're going to get into that a little 

13
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:57,330
bit later because a man has made a big 
mark doing exactly that,

14

15
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,770

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,980
Um,

21
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,530
Nope.
No,

22

they're not all on there,
just nocturnal a contagious is on their 

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,030
ancestors.
A trend.

24
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,940
Blood is red,
infectious,

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,180
contagious,

26
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,220
forward slash Joe.
Go there and get a free audio book.

27
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,040
There's more than 100,000
titles to choose from.

28
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,160
It's an awesome service and if you have 
a whisper,

29
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:40,161
sync whispers thing is an app that is 
amazing and what it does is you can 

30
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:43,440
listen to the audio book.
Then you can read it,

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,220
you could read the book like it works 
with the Amazon kindle fire Hd.

32
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,640
You read it and when you.
When you shut it off,

33
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:55,641
when you shut it down,
it picks up in your car or in your,

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,920
on your smartphone,
exactly where you left off the book 

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:00,920
reading it.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,840
It's amazing.
The audio accompaniment syncs up to what

37
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:05,790
you're reading,
so it's a really,

38
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:08,070
really cool service.

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,690

owned by the same people,

41
00:02:15,691 --> 00:02:19,850
that own tank.
Our good friends who provide the ethical

42
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:24,851
cell phone service and hover takes that 
same approach to domain name

on other,

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,720
other services.
Very,

50
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,420
very intuitive.
I've registered websites there myself.

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,480

it's an excellent place to register your

00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,790
websites and they're a sponsor of the 
show.

53
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,470

so funny man.
That dude's going to blow up that guy at

70
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,670
five years.
Huge.

71
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,500

72

So that's this Thursday night at the 
American comedy company.

73
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:43,231
There's still a few tickets left.
So jump on that ship bitch tonight or 

74
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:43,480
tomorrow night,
Wednesday night.

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,470
I'm at the Ice House with Ari Shaffir 
and Ian Edwards.

76
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,300
I was going to do one of those crazy 
shows.

77
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,620
We're bringing a lot of people on 
button.

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,660
I'm trying to work out all,
all this new shit.

79
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:54,850
So we're both,
we're all three of us going to do longer

80
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,080
sets.
Ian Edwards,

81
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,160
have you never seen him?
Really,

82
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,200
really funny guy.
And Ari of course is awesome.

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,960
So that's Wednesday night at the Ice 
House.

84
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,020
Oh,
we're also brought to you by on it on 

85
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,020
a.com,
which is um,

86
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,570
you know,
what the fuck it is.

87
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,000
Go there and buy some shit.
I said weapons.

88
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,960
People say we're selling weapons.
We're not,

89
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,380
we're selling fitness equipment.
And some of the best way to get 

90
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,430
functional strength is with something 
called a steel mace and yes,

91
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,130
if you want to box him in the head with 
it,

92
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,930
it would be a good thing to box him in 
the head with,

93
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,860
but that's not what it's for,
what it's for.

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,860
You fucks his functional strength.
What we concentrate on on on it is 

95
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,930
things that improve your performance,
whether it's your mental performance 

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,790
with nootropics or your mood through new
mood or your.

97
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:44,350
Your ability to perform at high levels 
of energy for longer periods of time.

98
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:49,351
With troon tech,
what we're just trying to do is to 

99
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:50,980
improve the way your body functions 
improve your fitness and your health and

100
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:55,981
your fitness,
and that's what these may spells are 

101
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:55,981
about.
There are these gigantic.

102
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,430
What amaze ball looks like.
It looks like something that you would 

103
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,490
see in like a gladiator movie or a video
game as your first weapon.

104
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah.
It's like it's a.

105
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,570
it's a cannon ball on the end of a long 
steel pipe and you swing it around and 

106
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,070
do all these different exercises with it
and in controlling something like that.

107
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:20,071
It's surprisingly hard,
especially when you grip it like really 

108
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,371
low on the end of the pole because you 
have all this leverage working against 

109
00:05:23,371 --> 00:05:25,320
you and what it does is it gives you 
real functional strength.

110
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,400
We have 10 pound ones and that seems 
like,

111
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,120
Oh my God,
what?

112
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,110
Ten Pounds?
That's nothing.

113
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,640
Trust me,
try it.

114
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,030
It is.
It's such a weird workout club bells the

115
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,210
same way we have these steel clubs.
I use a fee,

116
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,450
a 15 pound one and a 25 pound one and 
the fucking hard.

117
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,790
It's hard to do with like a really light
amount of weight.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,760
It's all functional.
Shed a light like kettlebells,

119
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,460
like battle ropes.
Go to [inaudible] dot com.

120
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,820
Check out all our shit and if you use a 
codename Rogan,

121
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:53,530
you will save 10 percent off any and all
supplements.

122
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,970
All right,
freaks.

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,010
We got Scott Sigler in the house.
We're going to get jiggy

124
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,990
with it.
We've got a lot of shit to talk about.

125
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,200
We're going to talk about some scary 
shit.

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,160
I'm just kidding.

127
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,810
Experiences

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,970
powerful.

129
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,600
Oh,
after Scott Sigler,

130
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,870
you know you're a bad motherfucker.
When you look at the back of your book 

131
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,500
and it says a worthy successor to 
Michael Crighton,

132
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,250
powerful praise.
Right?

133
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,870
I know,
isn't it awesome,

134
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,360
and someone else has something super 
cool about it was like,

135
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,070
Ooh,
look at that.

136
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,050
Yeah,
that's,

137
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:39,051
that's pretty bad ass dude.
And you said a nocturnals being turned 

138
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,001
into a TV show right now.
We're in the process of working on it 

139
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:42,001
right now.
Yeah.

140
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,230
How much control do you have as a writer
when that happened?

141
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I've been shocked by it.
Normally you have very little or no 

142
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,941
control at all and a couple of points in
my career I've been very lucky to work 

143
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:52,941
with people.
They're like,

144
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:55,350
let's get this as close to the vision 
you want as possible.

145
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,880
And this is the guy who produced hellboy
in hell boy too.

146
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,150
And the watchman's name's Lloyd Levin 
and Lloyd has been.

147
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,120
They've kept me involved at all phases 
of this.

148
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,950
Right now they're fishing up the pilot 
script for it.

149
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,850
So I don't write the pilot script,
but uh,

150
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,040
the guys who,
um,

151
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,110
who are writing,
it kind of sent me the plot steps.

152
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:17,550
Here's what we want the episode to be 
like,

153
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:22,551
is that sort of match what you're 
looking at and then because I'm writing 

154
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,310
the Bible for it,
so we're going to look at the 12 episode

155
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:28,311
arc of the first season and make sure 
everything fits in so we don't have any 

156
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,630
crazy ending that doesn't make any sense
and then I get to give them feedback.

157
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:32,670
Well,
you could try these things and it's very

158
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:33,120
collaborative,

159
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,910
so that's amazing.
That's a beautiful thing to hear.

160
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:40,911
I love when you hear that.
It's one of the most frustrating things 

161
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,881
to listen to when you hear someone who 
had a vision and they tried to express 

162
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:48,411
this vision to these other people that 
had the money and the people with the 

163
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,411
money like,
no,

164
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,411
no,
no,

165
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,411
no.
We got this.

166
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,740
We're going to fit.
We need a girl.

167
00:07:49,741 --> 00:07:51,330
You need this.
You need a.

168
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,470
We need to add a black guy.

169
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,900
It works though.
I mean the guys who can raise 

170
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:58,900
$20,000,000
get to kind of call the shots.

171
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Yeah,
and it's,

172
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,190
it's,
it's a weird thing to see.

173
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,960
I,
I told this story before,

174
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,240
there was a,
there was a guy named Dave,

175
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:06,430
I don't remember his last name,
I apologize,

176
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,660
but he was a really funny guy and he's a
really funny actor.

177
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:14,800
It's been in a bunch of movies like real
over the top hilarious guy.

178
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Well he got his first starring role in a
movie and I had a very small part in 

179
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,850
this movie and I watched all these 
people in suits.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,670
This man had cuff links on like 
beautiful,

181
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,000
like expensive cufflinks,
a perfectly tailored,

182
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,060
expensive fucking suit pin stripe,
a fat rolex with diamonds on it.

183
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,090
I mean this guy was fucking loaded,
right?

184
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,040
And he's doing like,
see?

185
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,570
He's like,
he's giving this guy like line reads,

186
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,550
telling them how to,
how he should do it.

187
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:50,551
Like I want you to come and like Whoa,
like thing that the guy thinks he's 

188
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,310
funny.
He's actually,

189
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,440
he's got so much power and so much money
that he's.

190
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,010
He literally is telling

191
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,380
the comedian how to be funny.
And it was,

192
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,860
it was a horrific thing to watch.
It was the movie,

193
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,130
the movie was called Frank mccluskey CSI
or something like that,

194
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,410
but a terrible,
terrible,

195
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,870
and they gutted it.
They had two ideas.

196
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:14,871
They had one that was going to be a pg 
13 and one was going to be pg or almost 

197
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,500
going to be armed when they went 
wherever they went,

198
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,850
less it went down.
It was.

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,480
It was all toilet jokes like you cut 
them out,

200
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,320
you have nothing.
It was.

201
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,600
It was written.
You stop the people who are good at what

202
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:29,601
they do from doing what they do.
You hired them for that purpose in the 

203
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,210
first place.
It's kind of counterintuitive,

204
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:35,260
but you got to think a guy who is such a
bad motherfucker that he did the 

205
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:35,260
watchman,
that he produced the watchman.

206
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,830
That guy knows what he's doing.
He's.

207
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,650
He's brilliant.
I mean,

208
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,830
it's been great.
That's such a good movie.

209
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,310
It was an excellent movie and great 
source material to start with,

210
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,090
but I'm a huge fan of hellboy when this.
When this popped up.

211
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:51,670
I mean I watch helpline like because my 
style is super hard science space.

212
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:54,000
We try to make all the bad things 
plausible,

213
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,940
so when you get to the nasty bits and 
the bloods flying,

214
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,530
you're fully bought in,
you're like,

215
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,531
I know how I know this works.
I learned about this in science class 

216
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:03,650
like that,
and you go watch hellboy,

217
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,070
which just a little bit more 
supernatural,

218
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:10,071
but the creature effects in the way 
everything was shot and it was just one 

219
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:13,161
of the most beautiful things I've ever 
seen to look up on the screen and now 

220
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:13,161
that guy's interested in turning this.

221
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:16,050
It's like it could not wish for anything
close more closely matched.

222
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,320
Dad's kind of be an amazing feeling.
A perfect combination.

223
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,380
Yeah.
The Universe is probably about to send 

224
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:24,400
an asteroid,
are way my fault.

225
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,750
Things are going to die and it's my 
fault.

226
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:28,820
Sorry.
Yeah.

227
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,420
That must be very comforting to know 
that you've got a.

228
00:10:31,421 --> 00:10:34,650
A guy that's willing to listen to you.
I had the first book infected.

229
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,820
That was a whirlwind because I started 
out giving all my books,

230
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:38,670
always free.
Audiobooks,

231
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,980
recorded myself.
Shot was podcast giveaways,

232
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,050
podcasts for free to build up an 
audience because I couldn't get anybody 

233
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:46,830
New York to pay attention because they 
don't.

234
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,940
Well,
we don't know if your horror,

235
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,740
we don't know if your Psi Phi,
we don't know if you're thriller.

236
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:54,741
We didn't know if you're military.
All these different ass kickings genres 

237
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:54,741
coming together so I couldn't get a book
deal.

238
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,150
Start giving the books away for free,
build up an audience,

239
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,690
landed a print deal with random house 
for infected and part of that deal is 

240
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,420
immediately optioned by rogue pictures 
for a movie and that's the last I heard 

241
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,690
it for like two years and I got to go 
down and have a couple of meetings with,

242
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,750
uh,
with some people but scriptwriter and 

243
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,521
never got to meet him.
Never got to see the script and 

244
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:19,631
immediately just kind of went off into 
the weeds and nothing ever came out of 

245
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:22,701
it.
So this is pretty exciting so far to to 

246
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:22,701
see things progressing.
Wow.

247
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:23,730
That's amazing man.
That's all I really don't.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like I said,
that's an awesome thing to hear when 

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,000
things are just falling into place in 
the proper order.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,300
Now when you write a book and then 
you're gonna,

251
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,330
have your book turned into a television 
series and you're sort of giving up,

252
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,560
you know,
your ideas to other people.

253
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:41,370
What,
how does that feel?

254
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:43,140
Is that a strange feeling?
Like what does,

255
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,560
what does that like?
Well,

256
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,300
this the second time around for me for 
doing this and it is.

257
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,730
It's a little bit strange,
but largely it's very exciting because 

258
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:53,730
what they do,
I can't do.

259
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,010
I'm not the guy

260
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,600
with the Rolex who's trying to control 
things.

261
00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,610
The,
the people who can paste this out for a 

262
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,200
one hour television show and can kind of
visualize the twelfth episode arc and 

263
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,821
then get someone to pay for it and get 
it shot correctly and get up on a 

264
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:08,821
screen.
That's a skill set.

265
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:09,280
I don't have it all,
so it's really.

266
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,220
I'm giving up a little bit,
but largely it's exciting.

267
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:15,520
Like I want to see the shit in this book
on TV.

268
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,490
I want to see it on the screen.
So it's a.

269
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,510
it's really not that nerve racking at 
all.

270
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,520
You have no idea how it's gonna turn 
out,

271
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,940
but at this point in my career,
I can see that I realized that the end 

272
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,320
product,
I'm going to have a tiny amount of 

273
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,320
control on it and you just kind of 
hoping for the best.

274
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,801
You hope these guys got the,
they've got the right vibe and they're 

275
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:35,920
going to want to put something as kick 
ass on the screen is in the book.

276
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,470
Wow.
That's got to be a very,

277
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,260
very interesting process.
I wish you luck with that.

278
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,050
That's,
it's going to be a fascinating journey.

279
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:46,690
And tell us what is the,
what's the plot of the,

280
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:48,730
uh,
the book and a summary.

281
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,840
Not Turtle is a it,
it's a kind of a throwback to eighties 

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,511
buddy cop movies.
And I grew up on know the whole trading 

283
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:02,191
places.
Beverly Hills cop 48 hours on that huge 

284
00:13:02,191 --> 00:13:02,710
turn turn and uh,
just,

285
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:07,711
just love that genre.
So this starts out as sort of a buddy 

286
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,650
cop procedural where there are,
um,

287
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,340
Brian clouser and Pooky Chang to San 
Francisco homicide inspectors.

288
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,840
And Brian's having these really nasty,
nasty dreams about killing people,

289
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,140
and early on in the book they go to a 
site and the murder scene matches his 

290
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,311
dream exactly.
And suspicion falls on him immediately 

291
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:28,720
that he's doing these borderline 
superhuman things to go shred people and

292
00:13:28,721 --> 00:13:31,900
body parts all over the place.
And then it,

293
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:37,110
it turns into the procedural from there,
they kind of have to follow the rabbit 

294
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,030
trail and it gets,
uh,

295
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,010
it,
it's hard to.

296
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,940
It's hard to summarize it without giving
a spoiling it,

297
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,430
but it,
it gets kind of paranormal,

298
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,460
not really the supernatural.
There's a rational explanation for 

299
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,770
everything,
but they uncover this massive conspiracy

300
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,500
within the police department.
There's been a coverup that's been going

301
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,250
on for,
for 200 years to stop this,

302
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,100
to let this particular group of people 
who are sacrificing innocence,

303
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,250
let them continue to sacrifice Brian.
But you gotta figure out how to shut 

304
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:05,250
that down and stay alive.

305
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,000
Wow.
Yeah.

306
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,530
That's some deep conspiratorial shit,
man.

307
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,530
Two hundred years of people keeping 
their mouth shut.

308
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,320
Yeah.
Well,

309
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:11,720
it's,
it,

310
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:16,730
it,
it plays off of the police department 

311
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,400
and one is as researching this,
one of the phrases that came up,

312
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:22,401
like the biggest gang in New York is the
cops and that goes back to when they 

313
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:23,850
first put in the police department and 
they start to get a lot of power.

314
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,970
Uh,
the organized crime and the gangs were,

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,040
you can get away with a lot of,
a lot of stuff,

316
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,890
but at some point if you crossed the 
cops,

317
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,810
whether they be good,
cops are corrupt cops,

318
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:38,811
you were screwed because you just had a 
level of power you couldn't match so 

319
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,441
that,
that they're the ones who have been 

320
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:43,791
keeping this thing quiet because there 
are a pattern of serial killers in San 

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Francisco and this other organization 
has a way of getting rid of the serial 

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,580
killers when the cops can't even find 
them.

323
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,700
So the cops were actually trying to 
keep,

324
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,710
keep this quiet and protect it because 
the end result is more people live in 

325
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,530
less people die,
but it's completely illegal as hell.

326
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,720
When you write a book like this,
how much,

327
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:04,830
when you're looking at human corruption 
and cop corruption,

328
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:09,831
how much did you investigate the Jew go 
and look at actual cases to find out 

329
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,840
what's plausible or do you just go 
completely on your instincts and what,

330
00:15:12,841 --> 00:15:14,400
you know,
just by general information.

331
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,890
There's a significant amount of research
and it,

332
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,730
but it's broad.
It's not,

333
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
it's not deep.
It's broad research.

334
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:26,201
Let's look into what kind of corruption 
there has been and how is organized 

335
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:30,221
crime set up in San Francisco and 
learning a lot of things that way 

336
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,050
because fortunately at this point in the
writing career,

337
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:38,051
I've learned to try and stay away from 
diving down the rabbit hole because you 

338
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:41,081
can learn all this incredible amazing 
stuff and then one percent of it 

339
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,901
actually makes it into the book and all 
the time you've invested in researching 

340
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,290
that for these kind of thriller style 
books is time that you.

341
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,290
Did you get nothing out of that.
So a lot of,

342
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,320
a lot of the superficial stuff learning 
how,

343
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,790
uh,
you know,

344
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
the mafia was run out of San Francisco 
and replaced by the tongues and the 

345
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,581
Russians and in a lot of other groups,
all that stuff is super cool and a ton 

346
00:16:00,581 --> 00:16:01,430
of that goes in there.
And um,

347
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,510
the police department was pretty helpful
in,

348
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,320
in research for this.
There's not a it,

349
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,100
it's not your typical,
these are dirty cops and they're going 

350
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,290
to shake you down.
They actually are trying to do something

351
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:17,291
that benefits the greater good,
but they have to totally ignore the law 

352
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,140
they're sworn to protect in order to get
the end result.

353
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,290
So it's a bit more fun.
Corruption,

354
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,260
if you can imagine that.

355
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,240
Wow,
that's a,

356
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:27,250
that's a,
that's a fascinating subject and I've 

357
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,581
always been fascinated by like the idea 
of secret societies that have been 

358
00:16:30,581 --> 00:16:33,110
around for 200 years doing horrible 
things and pulling it off.

359
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,060
And usually you,
you know,

360
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,610
even in jest,
no one takes those things serious.

361
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,230
If you,
you know,

362
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,300
discuss skull and bones or something 
like that.

363
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,430
Real police,
it's a fucking fraternity.

364
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,350
They do fall off there.
It's no big deal.

365
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,880
Illuminati,
all that good stuff.

366
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:47,850
Yeah.
But um,

367
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,070
the idea of it is,
it's a constantly fascinating source for

368
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,500
people because every now and then you 
find one that's real.

369
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,530
Every now and then you find a,
like a Jerry Sandusky case where no one 

370
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,180
really did tell the cops.
So for 20 years of trauma lasting,

371
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,520
it really did happen and you're like,
whoa,

372
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:07,130
like these things can happen.
Or the Miami.

373
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,160
Did you ever see Billy Corbin's 
documentary cocaine cowboys for cocaine 

374
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:17,201
cowboys won and cocaine cowboys?
Two or two of my favorite documentaries 

375
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:17,210
ever.
They're amazing.

376
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,590
And uh,
this guy,

377
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,580
Billy Corbin who directed it,
one of the things he pulled out was that

378
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,000
there was one year where the mind police
departments,

379
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,970
a graduating class from the police 
academy,

380
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,050
half of them eat,
all of them either wound up in jail or 

381
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,470
murdered.
Oh yeah.

382
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,520
For like half of them were murdered and 
half of them went to jail.

383
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Like the whole,
the whole thing was like a crazy 

384
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,271
criminal organization.
Like the entire police force was 

385
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,400
massively corrupt in the cocaine

386
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,390
era.
It's when,

387
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,950
I mean if you go to Miami,
have you ever been.

388
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,090
No,
never been to Miami.

389
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,830
It's,
it's avoidable Ed.

390
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,190
It's not totally necessary amount of 
money involved.

391
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:04,191
Back then it was just astronomical and 
you know somebody's going to bite on 

392
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:04,410
that sooner or later.
The amount of banks there,

393
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,470
it's insane.
The per capita there are much higher 

394
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,760
than anywhere else because they were all
laundering cocaine.

395
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,530
Money for real.
I mean that's really the root of it all.

396
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:14,720
I mean the,
the,

397
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,860
the actual impact that cocaine had on 
the economy of Miami is undeniable.

398
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,390
But this guy wrote about how crazy the 
police corruption was.

399
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,350
Bank debt or rather did this 
documentary,

400
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,740
showed it.
It's so it's possible,

401
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,420
you know,
people can go off the rails.

402
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,320
That was just a couple of decades ago.
You know,

403
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:37,510
where you've got,
you've got the money and you've got the 

404
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,060
power and they're isolated from a lot of
the self examination.

405
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,560
You know,
if you.

406
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,720
The question at the upper top levels of 
the police department can make a lot of 

407
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,330
shit go away.
You know,

408
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,360
that's,
that's the place it seems most likely 

409
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,360
to.
That's realistic there.

410
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,660
They had their hands on the drugs or 
hands on.

411
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,180
The criminals are hands on the money.
If somebody is going to go bad,

412
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,560
that's a good place to do it.
Yeah.

413
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:57,990
It's fascinating when you find out that 
it's true though.

414
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,850
It's like,
wow,

415
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,110
corrupt cop,
bunch of corrupt cops.

416
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:06,111
Like they tried it.
You almost wonder why it doesn't happen 

417
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,111
more often.
It probably does.

418
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,140
Yeah.
Well it probably,

419
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,480
they probably pretty good at,
like you said,

420
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,210
it's the biggest gang around.
Why would you want to piss off the gang,

421
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,170
you know,
plenty of little subtle corruption.

422
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,530
A little bit of this,
a little bit of the guys who can shoot 

423
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:21,530
you and it's legal.

424
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,330
Thank everybody.
Knows at the end of the day.

425
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,350
Really got to be careful around those 
guys because it can kill you and it's 

426
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:28,980
okay.
We're licensed to kill and they can just

427
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,410
say you attack them.
You know?

428
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:35,411
I mean how many,
how many times we've seen a cell phone 

429
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:37,671
camera of someone videotaping or cop and
the cop beat the shit out of the kid.

430
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,840
And then,
you know,

431
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,140
you hear from the,
uh,

432
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,680
the arrest papers that the police 
officer lied,

433
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:48,681
that the kid attacked him.
A lot of the kids spit on him or said 

434
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:48,750
something or there was a,
there was a guy and Alex Jones recently,

435
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:49,920
same thing,
these cops just,

436
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,860
they have ultimate power.
And when I know if that's a bad thing,

437
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:56,980
whenever any human beings got ultimate 
power over other people and there's the,

438
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,100
the,
the thing people I think tend to forget 

439
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,610
is there's millions of cuts across the 
country.

440
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,660
And,
and with that many per sample set that 

441
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,401
big and those opportunities,
some of those individuals or very small 

442
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:11,430
percentage,
those individuals are going to take that

443
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,560
opportunity.
Some of them are going to be nuts.

444
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,060
You only hear about those guy.
You don't hear about the 900,

445
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,480
99,000
that are just,

446
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,550
you know,
doing their job and willing to take a 

447
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:23,550
bullet for you everyday.
But yeah,

448
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:23,550
it's,
it happens.

449
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,760
Yeah.
And went to like a Christopher Dorner 

450
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:27,760
case happens.
People go,

451
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,460
Jesus Christ,
this is,

452
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,010
this could be a comp to that guy.
How did that guy get through?

453
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,070
You know,
or what happened to him in overseas and 

454
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,070
turned them into that guy,
you know,

455
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,890
who knows,
but how much of that plays a part of 

456
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,471
your writing.
It just sort of in a broad educational 

457
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,261
sense,
like you just pay attention to all that 

458
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:48,261
stuff.
It's largely to weave cap,

459
00:20:48,261 --> 00:20:48,370
history of reality.

460
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,430
I mean people are.
There's a certain amount of things 

461
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,430
people are expecting from a fictional 
novel.

462
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,020
Things that feel familiar.
While there's got to be some level of 

463
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,050
corruption is one cops got to be a total
bad ass.

464
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,570
Somebodies going to rub some guys up 
just because you're familiar with it.

465
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:04,330
You've seen that.
So a lot of those things go into.

466
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,570
A lot of them are invisible in the book.
I tend both with the science and with 

467
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,191
culture is to put in a lot of things 
you're already familiar with so that 

468
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:14,191
you.
You're like,

469
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:14,380
okay,
yeah,

470
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,010
okay.
Yeah.

471
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,790
And if you say,
yeah,

472
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,070
20 or 30 times,
like I know that I know that.

473
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,370
Then when it starts to go up to the next
level where the crazy shit starts to 

474
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:23,380
happen,
we've already got this rapport.

475
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:28,381
I've already got a rapport with you and 
your you've allowed yourself to buy in 

476
00:21:28,381 --> 00:21:28,900
completely.
So having those elements like,

477
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,820
you know,
realistic police things,

478
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:33,400
actually using the real history of the 
Mafia and San Francisco,

479
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,420
anything like that allows you to fall 
further into the story.

480
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,990
So it's very important to use real stuff
and kind of create that illusion.

481
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,340
That's awesome.
Man.

482
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,570
I,
I've always wanted to be a writer in 

483
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:47,570
some sense.
I've never had the time,

484
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,960
but I've always thought a bad awesome 
thing to like

485
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,810
carb wrote a terrible script once,
but we can do that in a way up here.

486
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,980
We were talking about starting a new 
show called getting my shorts were.

487
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:59,770
I talked to people who like say exactly 
what you said,

488
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:05,130
we sound for 10 minutes.
I interviewed about the fiction stuff 

489
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,130
that you liked,
the movie stuff you like,

490
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,130
et cetera.
Tell me you think this stupid idea.

491
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,960
We were talking about this and then at 
the end like,

492
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:12,961
okay,
well let's throw out some ideas for a 

493
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,491
story and I'll help bounce stories 
together and then when we get done you 

494
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:16,780
get up and walk away and then like a 
week later I've got like a five,

495
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,050
10 page short story and then that's the 
kind of thing that a human,

496
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,080
if you're close that joe got naked,
that sounds like it would be a fun idea 

497
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,130
that you get to write a story without 
the actual grunt work of getting down in

498
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:34,240
writing.
You come up with a big idea and then you

499
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:36,280
turn it over to somebody who does this 
on a regular basis.

500
00:22:36,281 --> 00:22:39,220
It's like exactly like taking lessons 
for something like here's what I want to

501
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:44,221
do and wanted to have this and then this
guy in and this chick should get naked 

502
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:46,741
because obviously that's very important 
to his story and then this sort of 

503
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:46,741
things happening and be like,
alright,

504
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,280
let's go see what we can do.
We'll go back and look that up.

505
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,250
There's so many fascinating.
Excuse me.

506
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:51,990
There's so many fascinating occupations 
out there.

507
00:22:51,991 --> 00:22:53,280
There's just not enough time in the 
world,

508
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,100
but writing has always been a 
particularly romantic one.

509
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:01,340
You know,
it's the idea of putting together 

510
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,880
something that you know,
crafting a story entirely in your head,

511
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,910
slapping it down on paper and then it 
exists entirely in the heads of the 

512
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:07,910
people that are reading it.
It's a.

513
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,240
The romance of it is so utterly 
overblown.

514
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,250
It's not.
If I've been lucky enough to do this 

515
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:15,250
full time for five years now it's my 
[inaudible].

516
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,700
All I do is my job and it's similar to 
mma.

517
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,590
When you see the guys come in the ring 
and you're like,

518
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:25,620
oh,
look at all this pageantry and all this 

519
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:25,620
wonderful stuff and the spotlight's on 
them and you know,

520
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,130
except for the ultimate fighter show you
don't see.

521
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,030
You don't see the years that go in.
Just getting crushed and working all the

522
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:36,031
time and all the sacrifice and all the 
things you got to do and then you get 

523
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:36,031
that moment,
oh,

524
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:37,510
the books in the store and I'm on tour 
and that last two weeks,

525
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:39,730
and then you'd go right back into the 
dungeon and do it some more.

526
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,100
And it's great fun job.
I don't want to do anything else.

527
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,050
I'm so happy to be doing it.
But yeah,

528
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:49,051
those moments of,
or like little tiny things that pop up 

529
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:49,051
every now and then.

530
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,560
Yeah.
Well to everybody outside of it,

531
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:55,561
that doesn't have to do the work.
That's where it's romantic or can be 

532
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:58,260
grueling sitting there smoking a 
cigarette in front of your typewriter.

533
00:23:58,261 --> 00:24:03,261
Like you're a hunter Thompson crap who 
your favorite writers when you were a 

534
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:03,261
coming up?

535
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:07,360
Uh,
definitely a Stephen King is the single 

536
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,761
biggest influence on me watching his 
ability to tell a story and 

537
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,990
characterized and like a parent,
the thing that always mesmerized me 

538
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,990
about him is he can take a secondary 
character,

539
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,620
give you one paragraph of description,
like here's a vocal twitch,

540
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,600
here's a physical twitch,
and here's this thing.

541
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,130
They believe in that you've got,
you know,

542
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,890
that guy's name,
20 years later he's the master of that.

543
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,610
Um,
and then Anne McCaffrey was a huge Scifi

544
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,770
writer that the dragon writers per net 
series.

545
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,730
So that was kind of the more of the 
science fiction area of things.

546
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,650
And Tom Clancy was another big one too.
Tom Clancy's,

547
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,180
the ability to take thousands of 
different things,

548
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:46,181
research them in detail and kind of put 
them all together where they come 

549
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:46,640
together at the end for a super over the
top ending.

550
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,180
Those are probably the biggest three.
And Jack London's and other gigantic one

551
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:50,360
too.

552
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:55,770
When I was a kid I read something 
somewhere where they were criticizing 

553
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,920
Stephen King's books and it was a,
in some.

554
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,350
I grew up in Boston and uh,
in Newton,

555
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,710
one of the suburbs of Boston and there 
was a lot of snobby people.

556
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,470
There's a lot of people that were like 
Stephen King,

557
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:12,120
like what base writing.
And I remember thinking that,

558
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,260
like,
why would you ever criticize a guy?

559
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,810
First of all,
so fucking prolific.

560
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,110
I mean,
and it's really fun stuff.

561
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,610
Like how stuffy do you have to be to not
appreciate a good Stephen King Book?

562
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,200
I,
you know,

563
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,290
it's,
he's on a completely different level 

564
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,400
than say the twilight writer,
but you still run into that today.

565
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,880
50 shades of gray and twilight and these
books come out.

566
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,910
Uh,
and,

567
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,990
and they blow up because that resonates 
with the end reader and all of this,

568
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,330
all this pompous,
arrogant bullshit about I'm writing art.

569
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,540
And you know what,
unless your book has sold a 200,

570
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:47,560
300,000
copies,

571
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:48,560
no one's gonna remember your name,
uh,

572
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:51,250
50 years you're going to be gone unless 
you get your book dusted off somewhere.

573
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,130
So the guys who are actually making 
stuff that resonates with people,

574
00:25:54,131 --> 00:25:57,940
that makes millions of people extremely 
happy to read it again and again,

575
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,870
and then go see the movies they get,
they get shat on all the time,

576
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,080
all the time.
And Stephen King now is getting an 

577
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,090
enormous amount of.
He's getting as props now from the 

578
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,090
industry,
I think.

579
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,090
But yes,
25,

580
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,430
30 years ago,
everybody was all pissed that this dirty

581
00:26:12,431 --> 00:26:17,431
but kid from Maine came out of nowhere 
and is eating all their lunches because 

582
00:26:17,431 --> 00:26:18,190
he writes great stories that people 
love.

583
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:19,180
They were,
they were pissed.

584
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,800
They wanted those books.
So not him.

585
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,120
Yeah,
they're crazy.

586
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:24,760
If you read the shining and tell me,
sign an amazing.

587
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:26,530
But yeah,
the movie's Great.

588
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,440
But the,
the uh,

589
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,690
the TV show didn't really dig that much,
but the movie was that Jack Nicholson 

590
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:34,450
movie,
although very different from the,

591
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,110
from the book,
but the books great.

592
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
My favorite book of his is misery.
Yes.

593
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,150
You go through misery and know and you 
know he doesn't,

594
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,280
he didn't,
just with a story

595
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
there,
he actually played with the topography 

596
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,280
on the page.
If you actually read the page,

597
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,750
Paul,
the main character has to write this 

598
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:53,750
story for Annie and then they switched 
font,

599
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,110
bring in the margin so it looks like 
regular typewriter page.

600
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,500
And then as the story's progressing 
letter start to fall off of the 

601
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,830
typewriter and the farther and it goes 
first,

602
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:06,831
it's the end and the eat.
Then the ell and as you get towards the 

603
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:06,960
end of the book,
we're not only as Paul's real life story

604
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:11,961
happening,
but the fictional stories coming to a 

605
00:27:11,961 --> 00:27:13,910
conclusion to.
There's all these scrawled pencil marks 

606
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:13,910
in there and just looking at the page 
starts,

607
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,861
distress you the fuck out.
And it wasn't until like the third time 

608
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:18,861
I read it,
I'm like,

609
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:19,230
because I read it once.
I'm like,

610
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,430
okay,
that was killer.

611
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,940
It was killer and read it again,
and then I'm like,

612
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:22,680
I'm reading third time,
like,

613
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:25,020
why am,
why am I so angry?

614
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,120
What is going on?
And I stopped and looked at him like,

615
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,300
it's just so even understands the art 
form of what vision,

616
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,460
how visually things look on a page,
you know,

617
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:33,600
why?
Why is that?

618
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:38,601
Who's on all sorts of drugs and shit.
Back in the day he was on some heavy 

619
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:40,950
duty Shit.
He said that.

620
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,560
I think it was Christine.
He didn't even remember writing.

621
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,650
It was.
One of them did or didn't remember 

622
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:48,870
writing.
It is alive,

623
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:52,620
man.
I think he was just fucked up man.

624
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,400
He was,
first of all,

625
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:55,950
he did a lot of cocaine and smoked a 
lot.

626
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,010
It was fascinating that you said that 
cigarettes were one of the things that 

627
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,940
he really missed when it came to the,
uh,

628
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:07,941
the creative process.
Are you talking about that with David 

629
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:07,941
Lee Roth the other day?
That nicotine is such a huge part?

630
00:28:07,941 --> 00:28:08,910
Yeah.
Process.

631
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,670
Well,
it's a,

632
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,970
I don't smoke,
I don't partake in it,

633
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:16,971
but there seems to be undeniable proof 
that it's some sort of a mental 

634
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:19,470
stimulant and it does something to 
accelerate thinking or does something to

635
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:24,471
the mind because too many people,
but like intelligent people at Bertrand 

636
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:28,010
Russell would,
wouldn't get on a plane if you couldn't 

637
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,731
smoke in the air.
Like if it didn't have room in the 

638
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:31,731
smoking section,
he wouldn't get a plant.

639
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:35,490
It was fucking poor guy was just 
attached it to this 10 tobacco tit.

640
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,490
Try some nicotine Joe,
see if it,

641
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,330
it's just nicotine.
If it comes out of here and go fuck 

642
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,251
yourself,
I'm not going to get me out of that 

643
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:46,251
crazy horse.
Um,

644
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:46,251
but uh,
yeah,

645
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:46,630
so many writers,
uh,

646
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,600
have been smokers,
you know,

647
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,850
but the thing about Stephen King and he 
quit and so he still puts out great 

648
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,330
stuff,
but he,

649
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,950
I think he struggles more.

650
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,710
Do you hear what he does though?
Supposedly,

651
00:28:57,711 --> 00:29:02,711
I mean because this is a bit of teams 
that he allows himself that one 

652
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:04,360
cigarette every time he finishes a novel
under,

653
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:08,640
he writes so many.
No joke is like I wrote 32 novels today.

654
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,880
Yeah,
that's funny.

655
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,270
That's a.
that's interesting that he allows 

656
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,891
himself one cigarette a year or so as I 
guess he's probably kicking out about a 

657
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:20,730
novel a year if not more.
He just.

658
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,930
He's got a different different style of 
writing to when you can,

659
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,780
when you can effortlessly bringing the 
supernatural the way he does.

660
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,990
There's not an enormous amount of 
research that's necessary.

661
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:36,010
I know when he wrote the green mile,
he researched a lot of things about the 

662
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,670
prison system and actual history,
but if it's a modern day go story,

663
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:43,671
you don't have to research anything.
You just sit down and do your thing and 

664
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:43,671
then that

665
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:44,680
allows him to allow him to write a 
little bit faster than a lot of people.

666
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,550
Did you ever read the Tommy knockers?
Oh yeah.

667
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,380
I love that one man.
He's got the best,

668
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,210
in my opinion,
the best supernatural a scenarios.

669
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,590
He comes up with so many different 
maximum maximum overdrive.

670
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,630
Did you realize that?
Oh,

671
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:06,310
I love that movie and it's interesting.
Now I'm coming to my fifth and final 

672
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,041
book with Random House and I write these
hard science techno thrillers with the 

673
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,550
fuck ton of monsters and um,
and,

674
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,900
and super and you know,
have a science fiction stuff,

675
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,910
so they always start out normally like,
oh,

676
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:18,340
I've seen this before,
this the CIA CSI episode.

677
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:21,370
Then things go absolutely haywire and 
you're in for the ride,

678
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,660
but I've been kind of Jonesing to get 
back to the,

679
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,610
the Stephen King that inspired me when I
was a kid,

680
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,320
which is,
you know,

681
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:33,550
you can spend so much more time on 
character and plot and developing things

682
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,970
if you don't have these large structural
organizations like the cops were trying 

683
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:38,970
to get.

684
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,820
Like the one I'm writing now is 
pandemic.

685
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:44,821
It's the final book and the infected 
trilogy and I'm trying to get help on 

686
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:48,241
what it's actually like in the situation
room and the series is taken itself to 

687
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,660
that level.
But I don't follow politics for shit.

688
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:51,100
I have no fucking idea what I'm talking 
about.

689
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:52,630
The situation.
You mean the situation room?

690
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:53,510
The President?
Yeah,

691
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,310
the White House.
The like the CNN show with Wolf Blitzer,

692
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,910
first buck infected is head.
Anybody reads it as read,

693
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:03,370
Stephen King will see the influences 
plain as day because it's largely,

694
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,700
it's a one university of Michigan 
linebacker who blew out his knee in the 

695
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:08,770
rose bowl.
So never not to go,

696
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,830
never got to go.
Pro was would have been a number one 

697
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,830
draft pick,
hands down,

698
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,610
but now he works in computer support 
because he didn't finish his degree and 

699
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:17,610
he can't play ball anymore.

700
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,410
So this is giant super dangerous guy 
with a lot of rage issues and works 

701
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,030
really hard to control his rage.
And then he gets infected by this,

702
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:25,390
uh,
this alien vector,

703
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:30,391
this other thing going on and it turned 
and he spends a lot large part of the 

704
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:33,841
book trying to not kill people,
but most of that takes place in his 

705
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,940
apartment and in the town of Ann Arbor.
And that's the Stephen King Angle,

706
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,350
which is we're gonna take a small town.
We can develop this out.

707
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:43,650
I can do whatever I want and I don't 
have to justify why isn't the swat team 

708
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:43,900
kicking in the door?
And all these other things,

709
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,800
so now that I'm writing this complicated
crap,

710
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,830
the situation room,
like I think that's kind of run its 

711
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,191
course.
I want to get back to the smaller cast 

712
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,440
in the smaller towns.
I grew up in small town Michigan and I 

713
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,440
think that's why a lot of stuff 
resonated with me.

714
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,940
It's the same thing,
just a different accent and I want to 

715
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,640
for the future,
I would probably try and get back more 

716
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:02,640
into that,
that kind of thing.

717
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,910
I thought it was amazing that Stephen 
King wrote so many books about a writer 

718
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:05,910
from Maine.
Yeah.

719
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,820
It's like after awhile you're like,
come on man,

720
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:11,821
I really do.
And you've got another book about a 

721
00:32:11,821 --> 00:32:12,400
writer from Maine.
Like Jesus,

722
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,550
I know you want to write a book a year,
but fucking come.

723
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,750
I can't be a baseball player or a 
fireman or some shit.

724
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,480
Yeah,
it's got to be a goddamn writer from.

725
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,170
That's why you got into the Green Mile,
which is about as different than 

726
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,170
anything else.
He's written an amazing.

727
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,600
Christine is another one of my 
favorites.

728
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:31,630
Have you read any of his sons work?
Joe?

729
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,470
Joe Hill,
yeah.

730
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:37,471
I've read a horns and have read the 
first couple collections,

731
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:42,661
have the lock and key a comic book,
which is what he's becoming most well 

732
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:42,790
known for it.

733
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,880
Oh really?
Yeah.

734
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,940
Yeah.
He was the locking key comic book lock 

735
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,170
and key is um,
uh,

736
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,640
I forget where the family originates,
but they wind up moving to a,

737
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,650
um,
a mansion they inherit in Rhode Island.

738
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,260
So it's very similar to,
forgive me,

739
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:59,630
lock and key fans by have this strong.
It's very similar to old school.

740
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:04,631
Stephen King,
small town family goes moves into this 

741
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:07,331
haunted house.
It's kind of shining ask and there's a 

742
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:10,781
lot of different keys that will open up 
different rooms in the house and the 

743
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,050
rooms in the house or all these crazy 
paranormal portal type things.

744
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,070
But uh,
he,

745
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:13,880
he,
the artists,

746
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:16,790
I believe it's Gabriel Rodriguez and 
they both one eisner awards,

747
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,740
which is the academy award of comic 
books for this.

748
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,150
So he's really,
um,

749
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,300
although obviously he's had an enormous 
amount of press coverage from being 

750
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,950
Stephen King's son and writing core a 
ton.

751
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,220
He's also developed this comic book 
thing with the Idw is the publisher and 

752
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,070
it's an enormous,
enormous success.

753
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,910
I read the one,
I think it's called little yellow,

754
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,380
yellow box or something like that.
What is it?

755
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,940
I don't want to even give away what the 
plot is,

756
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,440
but it was great stuff.
It's,

757
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:48,060
um,
I'll pull it up.

758
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,710
The dark tower series is that can the 
dark.

759
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,560
I,
I read the first one a lot when it first

760
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:59,561
came out,
but all my friends are so addicted to 

761
00:33:59,561 --> 00:33:59,561
that series.
Have you read,

762
00:33:59,561 --> 00:33:59,561
have you followed that?
I followed up,

763
00:33:59,561 --> 00:34:02,640
I think through book six and then,
um,

764
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,950
I don't think it's a spoiler at this 
point.

765
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:08,951
It's 20 years old.
There's a point in the series where 

766
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:08,951
Stephen King actually writes himself 
into the series,

767
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:11,780
so the characters are actually talking 
to Stephen King who's going like,

768
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:13,130
wait a minute,
I wrote you guys.

769
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,330
And I was like,
okay,

770
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,710
that's just to Metta for me.
I,

771
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,970
I've,
I'm out.

772
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm out.
But the,

773
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,930
I think the first three dark tower books
are the single best trilogy of,

774
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,140
of any kind anywhere.
Those three books are just f man,

775
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,990
if he just stopped right there.
So there's still a masterpiece.

776
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,460
The series went on,
I think the first three books or there's

777
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,160
never been anything better written in my
opinion,

778
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,390
so it's perfect.
Wow.

779
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,360
Yeah,
he was a bad motherfucker and still is.

780
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,430
Yep.
Heart shaped box is his heart shaped 

781
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:42,430
box.
Yeah,

782
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:42,430
that was.
I read that one.

783
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,510
It's about a haunted funded suit.
Really,

784
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,160
really good stuff,
man.

785
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,020
He looks a lot like his dad too.
It's kind of creepy shades of his dad,

786
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,350
but he's kind of.
His style is unique.

787
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,140
I mean it's,
it's very much his sort of influence you

788
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:58,380
can tell,
but very much his.

789
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,430
Everybody writes horror is influenced by
Stephen King,

790
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,390
you know,
that's like,

791
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,620
Eh,
I don't know how to,

792
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,500
you know,
not be [inaudible] there's no way to not

793
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:09,770
be a lot of.
A lot of people get into it specifically

794
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,620
because you read those books or you read
Peter Straub or any of the other,

795
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:14,930
you know,
the heavyweights back and king's Day,

796
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,700
John Sol,
etc.

797
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:21,701
And you read those and those call to you
and you want to make shit like that and 

798
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:22,280
then when you start making your own 
shit,

799
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,650
well of course it's going to have a 
little bit of that little bit of that in

800
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:25,700
there.
And king king,

801
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:28,130
rally mitsis influenced by a ton of 
people and he's like,

802
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:31,010
if you read myself closely enough,
you see their stuff in the book.

803
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,390
It's just the way it goes.
Yeah.

804
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:37,391
He was actually a big proponent of 
reading other guys' stuff to help your 

805
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:37,960
writing.
I

806
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,600
read Stephen King on writing.

807
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,070
Oh yeah,
great book.

808
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:46,100
That's a.
It's a bible for me because it's 

809
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,910
specifically because it gets rid of a 
lot of the pomp and circumstance and 

810
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,910
the,
you know,

811
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,560
the nose up in the air.
It's,

812
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,990
it's so blue collar and you know,
for a small town guy like me,

813
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:59,991
you read that.
It's like you can read on writing by 

814
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,900
Stephen King and see,
stop falling in love with yourself.

815
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,420
Stop sucking your own dick.
Pardon the phrase.

816
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:05,010
You're not that important.
You're not that great.

817
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:10,011
Just tell the story.
Stop putting in words that are going to 

818
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:12,491
make everybody realize how important you
are and just tell your tell your story 

819
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:12,491
and that's like the main jest of it is 
how to,

820
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:17,360
how to streamline everything and not be 
a pompous windbag but still tell your 

821
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,730
great story.
So it,

822
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,080
it really resonated with me

823
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,540
being a pompous.
Windbag is a problem and pretty much 

824
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,540
everything is.

825
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,540
Oh,
can everybody,

826
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:24,540
everybody?
Yeah.

827
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,090
I actually,
I,

828
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,520
when I my podcast,
because I give away all my books is free

829
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:32,521
audio books.
I play up the pompous windbag that's 

830
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,580
like the joke within a joke.
I come on and talk about awesome.

831
00:36:33,581 --> 00:36:35,950
The story is going to be in all this 
other stuff and the fans that they,

832
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,630
they eat it up.
It's funny.

833
00:36:37,631 --> 00:36:39,000
That's my shtick.
I can't do standup,

834
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,880
but I can do that thing.
And because you're,

835
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,440
you get used to it after awhile.
You know when people get very successful

836
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:49,060
at something and then they start to.
They start to believe their own bullshit

837
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,820
and that's when you start to get that 
crazy self-importance coming on.

838
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:54,370
And what the sad thing about that is 
when you start to see people like that,

839
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,620
the majority of their fans are like,
oh god,

840
00:36:56,621 --> 00:36:58,690
he was so awesome back in the day,
but now look at him.

841
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,170
You know,

842
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,230
it happens to a lot of people.
The pressure or something.

843
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,750
The pressure of a success,

844
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,010
I think.
Yeah,

845
00:37:06,011 --> 00:37:11,011
the success.
I mean if you're surrounded by yes men 

846
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,490
all the time and nobody's there 
criticizing your ideas

847
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:16,470
and you're not objective and you know,
you don't sort of self analyze.

848
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,420
A lot of people don't like to self 
analyze.

849
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,430
It gets them confused.
But we've all seen the,

850
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:23,020
the real life pompous,
windbag.

851
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,520
And it's a shocking thing.
Yeah,

852
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,760
it's so gross to.
One of the reasons why it's so gross is 

853
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:29,760
because you hope and pray that you could
never be that guy.

854
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,800
You know,
you hope and pray that if the situation 

855
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,650
was reversed and you were in his shoes,
that you wouldn't be possible.

856
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:36,460
It couldn't be possible.

857
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,480
I feel like there's a lot of you getting
your ass kicked early in life and just 

858
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,710
failure after failure.
There's an enormous amount to be said 

859
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,231
for trying things and failing as opposed
to people who like the first thing they 

860
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,280
try out of the gate,
huge success and then you know,

861
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,340
then you haven't developed that,
that humble nature of I tried 28 things 

862
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,090
in 27 of them failed miserably.
So this one thing,

863
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm not going to get too crazy with 
this.

864
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,880
You know,
we're having success.

865
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,740
Um,
you,

866
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,640
you tend to see that in hollywood and in
writing.

867
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:04,890
Some people come out of the gate,
get that big novel,

868
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,160
it blows up.
Then after that they don't have much 

869
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,170
access and they can't figure out what's 
going on because they think they're very

870
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,070
important in this amazingly

871
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:17,090
chicken j changed their own frequency.
they're putting out because of their 

872
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,500
success and that sabotages them.
That's in that.

873
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,910
That's the sad thing.
That's what,

874
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,700
that's what hamstrings a happens to.
So many though.

875
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Yeah.
To so many different art forms to music 

876
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:27,740
musicians that happens.
So,

877
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:27,880
you know,
you know,

878
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,890
the guys that are the lead singers of 
these big bands and they go fucking 

879
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,180
loony tunes.
The band falls apart and.

880
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,920
Well,
what was it?

881
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,300
Was it partying,
drugs,

882
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,390
adulation.

883
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,760
Undulations a serious possibility.
Adulation is a big drug.

884
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,060
The scary one.
You can get delusional in that shit.

885
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,800
You know,
it's uh,

886
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,880
it's,
it's a fascinating one for character 

887
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:49,880
development though,
isn't it?

888
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:49,880
It is.
You can,

889
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,450
you can play off them anytime you've got
a story where you've got someone in 

890
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,860
position of power,
it's almost impossible to write them 

891
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,070
from here's a normal,
humble person.

892
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,240
This position of power,
like if you're writing About,

893
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,480
you know,
the mayor of san francisco isn't the 

894
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:06,480
story that the police chief of san 
francisco,

895
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,890
it's almost impossible for them to get 
to that position if they're a nice 

896
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,741
regular,
humble person because at some point in 

897
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:15,811
any political construct,
you have to become cutthroat and you 

898
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:15,811
have to looK at other people as an,
as,

899
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,850
as an obstacle to be removed and there 
can't be humanity involved.

900
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:20,380
Like everybody at the top politics right
now.

901
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,480
Those are some cutthroat,
cutthroat people.

902
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,090
Even baracK obama didn't get worried was
by playing nice,

903
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:30,091
you know?
And so when you writing a character 

904
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:30,091
about someone in that higher position of
power,

905
00:39:30,091 --> 00:39:31,570
you have to channel some of that in 
there.

906
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:36,571
There has to be that level of a self 
assuredness all the way up to arrogance 

907
00:39:36,571 --> 00:39:38,830
and that dismissive nature as well.
You know,

908
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:41,350
if you're in my way,
I'm gonna tell you probably shouldn't be

909
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,940
in my way because not going to go well 
for you.

910
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,950
And then that full on confidence and 
then they just,

911
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,080
you just get rid of them.
If you crush them then too bad.

912
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:49,270
I told you when you start to write a 
story,

913
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:54,330
do you,
do you have like a full idea in your 

914
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,970
head before you sit down in front of a 
computer or do you have like,

915
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:58,240
I want to write a vampire cop drama.

916
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,830
Like you mean what,
what is it that.

917
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,870
Do you have a bunch of different ways 
that it gives birth in your mind that 

918
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,670
it.
It tends to come from several different 

919
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:11,191
places.
I watch and I watch as much science tv 

920
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:11,790
as I can and I read up as much as i can.
And in the,

921
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,720
in the natural world,
there's always something like,

922
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:14,740
oh my,
look at that,

923
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:16,300
look,
this creature can do that thing.

924
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:18,030
The water bear can survive in space,
you know,

925
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,990
holy crap.
And that'll stick.

926
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,720
And then at some other point you will 
watch something about,

927
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,130
uh,
you know,

928
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:28,170
here's asexual reproduction.
If they're in this particular chemical 

929
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:28,170
environment,
then that'll stick.

930
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,460
And then a couple things stick and then 
at some point I'll just be working on 

931
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:32,620
something else and four or five things 
will come together.

932
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,990
And then that's the center point of the 
idea.

933
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,410
I'm like,
well,

934
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:38,080
what if we had creatures that did this 
and then this happened,

935
00:40:38,081 --> 00:40:39,910
and then they took over the world kind 
of thing.

936
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:43,090
From there you have to go and hammer out
an outline.

937
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:48,430
I try and hammer out an outline with the
tiny bit of science knowledge that I 

938
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,510
have.
And then I'm really fortunate again,

939
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,640
because of the podcast,
I started getting people,

940
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,040
scientists emailing me going,
wow,

941
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:59,041
I love what you're doing.
You're really trying to get the science 

942
00:40:59,041 --> 00:40:59,041
right.
You fuck this up.

943
00:40:59,041 --> 00:41:01,210
So if you get into neurochemistry,
again here I'm a phd,

944
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:06,211
give me a call and like these I started 
getting all this shit in and now it's 

945
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:06,520
amazing.
Now I've got this battery of people.

946
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:10,150
I'll do the outline and then I will send
them all the outline and say,

947
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:11,110
all right,
tear it up.

948
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,520
And then they,
they shred it,

949
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,630
they shred it,
and they'll come back.

950
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,040
Well you can't do that,
but here's some other.

951
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,830
We just found out about this.
You could do this.

952
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:20,110
That is so cool.
What an amazing.

953
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,030
And they,
they,

954
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,730
they have a blast with it.
And then I restructure my outline,

955
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:29,900
do a detailed first draft and then we 
repeat for people that are listening 

956
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:29,900
right now to go,
well,

957
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,190
what's his podcast?
What's,

958
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:31,690
what's the name of your podcast?
Podcast.

959
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:33,680
Just got sick.
There's audio books and you can,

960
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:33,990
if you

961
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,350
go to itunes and search for scott 
sigler,

962
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,240
s c o,
t t s I g l e r,

963
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:41,000
you'll find that and,
or scott's lego.com.

964
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,730
We have them there and we've been goIng 
on seven years now.

965
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,880
Is that right?
So every sunday for seven years we put 

966
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:48,920
out an episode,
I want you to pull a picture up of those

967
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:51,230
water bears.
I think they're also called tardigrades.

968
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:51,950
Tardigrades.
That's it.

969
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:54,110
Yeah.
They can survive in space.

970
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:59,480
It's so weird when nature is as crazy as
anything you could ever think of.

971
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,220
Fiction.
Yeah.

972
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,690
And it's just undeniable.
there it is.

973
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:04,820
Here's a photograph of it.
This is a real thing.

974
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,860
That's why the sciences,
you know,

975
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,910
maybe those things fucking great and 
they're super tiny.

976
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:15,911
But you know,
of course my brain immediately looks 

977
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:15,911
this goes,
okay,

978
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:16,040
what if that was eight feet long?
Let's make that thing eight feet long,

979
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,080
jesus,
and let's make that hide,

980
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,240
you know,
pretty much bulletproof.

981
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,550
Let's do those two things to it.
For the folks listening and not watching

982
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,580
this thing looks like it looks like a 
giant rhino with like a circular diamond

983
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:34,451
drill for a mouth flashlight.
It is the waY it looks like a super 

984
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:38,390
diamond alien fleshlight and the thing 
it looks like a star wars creature.

985
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:43,920
It also looks like it Has that kind of 
like a cotton capon or something like 

986
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,240
that.
Like it doesn't look like it's dude,

987
00:42:44,241 --> 00:42:49,241
that thing survives in space so it can 
survive in space and the membranes get a

988
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:51,590
little different when you get down that 
that small,

989
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:56,591
but that's the kind of thing where maybe
a graphic artist who does a lot of acid 

990
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:00,260
could come up with that maybe shows up 
and you're like,

991
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,850
that's,
that's my god.

992
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:06,851
look at it's fucking mouth for the folks
at home,

993
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:10,640
it's literally got a giant shark mouth.

994
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,400
Wow.
That.

995
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,780
And I see this is,
listen to this,

996
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,990
I just realized this.
I'm finishing up a book called pandemic,

997
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,730
which goes infected then contagious,
then pandemic and,

998
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,480
and there's a creature in pandemic,
uh,

999
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,630
and the mouth is similar to that.
And I just realized that that's where I 

1000
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:32,801
got it from,
but I think it's been floating in the 

1001
00:43:32,801 --> 00:43:33,080
back of my head forever and it's 
actually popped out in this book.

1002
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:35,900
Look at that photo.
That is insane.

1003
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,630
That is insane,
folks.

1004
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:39,800
It's,
you could find them.

1005
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:41,960
They're called either water bears.
People call them that,

1006
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:44,810
or tardigrades I think is the scientific
name for it.

1007
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,690
And they are the creepiest looking 
motherfucker.

1008
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,580
How small are those things there?
There a microscopic.

1009
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,820
They're microscopic.
Yeah.

1010
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,440
Yeah.
They're incredibly couple of microns.

1011
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:59,441
I think it's spooky little creatures,
but then you get in that gives you so 

1012
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:06,251
many storytelling possibilities.
You've got a creature that seems 

1013
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:06,251
insignificant.
You can't even see it,

1014
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:07,850
and yet if you know,
if,

1015
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,870
if we suddenly lost her atmosphere for 
whatever reason or the kennedy,

1016
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,840
the environment changed significantly 
and all the humans died,

1017
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,870
this thing could still be around and 
then this thing could start evolving in 

1018
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:22,980
columbia zone may be the universe really
doesn't have a sense of time and just 

1019
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,740
sets up these little,
uh,

1020
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,870
extra seeds laying around genetic 
material like tardigrades just in case 

1021
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,280
you assholes hit that button and nuke 
the whole planet sideways.

1022
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,970
These little motherfuckers can grow into
something that can survive in a vacuum.

1023
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,490
It would start over real quick.
If we got wiped out,

1024
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,260
it would.
It would Start over again pretty fast.

1025
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:42,600
I wonder.
I wonder what it would be next.

1026
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:44,790
Would it be dolphins?
Would it be some sort of.

1027
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,430
They see this is this shit I thinK about
all the time for the buck.

1028
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,940
And odds are you're not going to get any
sea creature for a couple of reasons.

1029
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:54,590
Number one,
no hands.

1030
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,700
There's no tool.
Use it.

1031
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:56,550
Number two,
no fire.

1032
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:59,720
The two biggest factors that go in our 
tool use and fire.

1033
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,780
True.
And then I think you also are not going 

1034
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,911
to get.
This drives me crazy tO watch a scifi 

1035
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:07,400
shows about this.
Men lion lions don't need to evolve.

1036
00:45:07,401 --> 00:45:12,401
They're an apex predator.
There's no need for them to change 

1037
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:12,401
anything.
For the most part,

1038
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:15,940
it's the.
It's the little things that have to run 

1039
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,190
from everything else.
and especially with humanity.

1040
00:45:16,191 --> 00:45:21,191
I think as we evolved as the biggest 
thing was losing the hair and having to 

1041
00:45:21,191 --> 00:45:24,581
invent some way to stay warm and you 
start to use tools to make clothes and 

1042
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:24,581
tools to hunt.

1043
00:45:24,581 --> 00:45:26,000
And as soon as someThing has to use a 
tool and figures that out,

1044
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,470
that's,
that's the flashpoint.

1045
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,970
From there it goes,
it goes crazy.

1046
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,570
Why did we lose the hair?
I'm not entirely sure.

1047
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:37,690
I don't know,
but there wasn't a large need for it in 

1048
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:37,690
a greatly temperate environment like 
savannah,

1049
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:39,530
africa.
So in the human Body,

1050
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:42,350
all evolution,
if there's something that you just don't

1051
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:47,351
need anymore and you're burning calories
to keep that thing going and it takes 

1052
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:51,520
energy to support that.
If you have success of mutations where 

1053
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,580
that thing gets smaller and smaller,
there's no penalty.

1054
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,910
There's no penalty.
Oh well his hands are this big and he 

1055
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:58,370
can't use a spear.
You're not going to survive that long.

1056
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,890
But if your ear lobes shrink and you can
hear just fine,

1057
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:01,920
there's no penalty.
so this,

1058
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,480
the evolution kind of gets rid of the 
stuff that you don't need.

1059
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,470
It is a

1060
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,530
fascinating what you say though about 
the intelligent sea creatures never be 

1061
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:13,790
able to get like their physical 
environment to change.

1062
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:14,360
Right?
Right.

1063
00:46:14,361 --> 00:46:15,050
Yeah.
That's a.

1064
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:17,690
That's an interesting point.
I never really thought about the no fire

1065
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,260
thing.
Did they create it?

1066
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,960
You can't.
If you can't

1067
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,400
make fire and refined metal than you are
cut off at the knees as far as what you 

1068
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,601
can do from there.
And James Cameron played with that in 

1069
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,410
the abyss with having his intelligent 
water based species.

1070
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,620
But it would be very.
It's very difficult to conceive any way 

1071
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,080
you could get that going,
so it's your land based,

1072
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:41,770
it's got to have hands or appendages 
that are ready to become hands.

1073
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:46,990
Couple of basic things so it could 
easily start out with some kind of 

1074
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,680
primate or some kind of small mammal 
right off the bat,

1075
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,170
but there's also some pretty kick ass 
reptiles out there and

1076
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:53,910
hurts g you hear about the ukrainian 
army has been training.

1077
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,911
Dolphins can use like knives and and 
they've been attaching knives and 

1078
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:00,960
pistols to their head and they've 
trained them to use them so they can now

1079
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:03,200
use these knives to do things.
Yeah,

1080
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:08,210
so now that right now,
this was on the news today that they 

1081
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,090
lost the dolphins that had the pistols 
are the guns on them and they're on the 

1082
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:15,081
loose right now.
So there is these rogue dolphins that 

1083
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:15,680
have guns on them that are just 
terrorizing the sea.

1084
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:17,250
But come on,
I swear to god,

1085
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:17,790
it's true.

1086
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,560
Dolphins apparently swam away to get 
laid.

1087
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,930
They were out there looking for some 
reason they haven't come back.

1088
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,610
That's why would they come back?

1089
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:24,930
Guns man guns.

1090
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah,
they got guns and they're trying to get 

1091
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:30,400
some things or one of the few creatures 
that they murder.

1092
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah,
they'd kill

1093
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,710
for no other reason than just to kill 
and also dolphins rape,

1094
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:37,740
which is messed up,
so now you've got these things swimming 

1095
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:37,740
around and they're trained to kill 
diverse as the problem.

1096
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,810
They're specifically trained to kill 
divers,

1097
00:47:38,811 --> 00:47:41,350
so I'm going to rape a dolphin saturday 
at zero than san diego.

1098
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,410
Dolphins are trained to kill divers.
They're military.

1099
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:46,240
They're trained to kill.
That's the program.

1100
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,050
It's program specific.
Diverse or not diverse.

1101
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:56,550
I'm sure the ukrainian controllers.
This is inherited from the russian 

1102
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:59,641
program and they would have specific 
parameters to train them to go out and 

1103
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:03,091
kill a certain shape or a certain color 
or have I fucked up that train dolphins 

1104
00:48:03,091 --> 00:48:04,760
to go out and be assassins?
Yeah.

1105
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,480
What a douchey move.
Well,

1106
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,990
these things rule.
Dolphins are very creepy though.

1107
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:13,320
Would they kill babies?
They killed the baby of a.

1108
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,040
When a female it gives birth.

1109
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,860
I think she won't meet with the mail for
several years.

1110
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,650
So if a male comes along and it's not 
his babies,

1111
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:21,550
he just kills them.
Yeah,

1112
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,480
get a main.
Again,

1113
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,230
it's dolphins.
Dolphins are gangs there.

1114
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,240
The gangsters of the sea.
They are not messing around except for 

1115
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,860
killer whales.
Separate killer whales eat them.

1116
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,880
nobody screws with the killer whale.
The apex of the apac,

1117
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,270
other than humans,
they've got no.

1118
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,820
They've got no predator.
There's nothing that hunted.

1119
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Killer whale.
I thought happy feet was a kind of a 

1120
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,181
fascinating monster.
Moving sort of away a monster alien 

1121
00:48:48,181 --> 00:48:49,540
movie because it dealt with the whole 
idea of living in this,

1122
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,820
you know,
semi-aquatic world.

1123
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:56,650
All of a sudden these aliens from the 
other part of the world from the surface

1124
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:01,310
come and fuck everything up and kidnap 
people and take photographs and shit.

1125
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:03,100
And it's,
it's really kind of interesting when you

1126
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:08,101
think about how much life must suck if 
you live in the ocean and these crazy 

1127
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:12,970
assholes live out above the ocean with 
these giant metal machines that they've 

1128
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,570
created a scoop,
literally scoop life in nets.

1129
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,820
Take your right and just,
you don't give a fuck what they get.

1130
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:19,810
Dolphins.
Whoops,

1131
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,790
sorry.
Sometimes they get dolphins on purpose.

1132
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Imagine what it was like for whales,
which are pretty f and intelligent and 

1133
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,690
have language for communication and for 
what I think 100 million years,

1134
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:33,691
something like that.
There's nobody screws as well because 

1135
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:33,691
you can't because they're gigantic and 
they just ignore you.

1136
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:38,281
Then all of a sudden here come these 
ships and here come these harpoons and 

1137
00:49:38,281 --> 00:49:39,490
they're screwed.
There's nothing they can do.

1138
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,580
There's nothing they can do.
Who's the first guy to try to harpoon a 

1139
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:44,580
whale?
Fat guy was a bad motherfucker.

1140
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:47,430
You gotta think about that.
Sets a gangster movie.

1141
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:49,740
I'm going to eat.
You know?

1142
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:51,610
I mean,
that guy's not playing games.

1143
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,760
I don't know what I've heard about that.
It's probably,

1144
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,940
you know,
it's kind of an ice age thing or a place

1145
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:02,941
where there's ice so the whales have to 
break the ice to come up to breathe and 

1146
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:04,420
a whale breaking through the ice to its 
blowhole can get out there.

1147
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:06,690
You just stabbed that son of a bItch and
I don't know.

1148
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,890
I don't know how they did it,
but somebody figured out that's a lot of

1149
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,180
good eaton.
Wow.

1150
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,630
That's harsh life.
Yeah.

1151
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,710
Harsh life.
When you get to eat a whale.

1152
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,880
The dolphin thing reminds me of.
I've got,

1153
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,350
uh,
some of my fans were tweeting today 

1154
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:24,350
because that basically the same thing 
happens in my book,

1155
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:26,800
the gfl,
so I've got a title fight,

1156
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:27,980
which is what I emailed you

1157
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,800
on to start with,
which was an mma scifi story.

1158
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,140
And then we have the galactic football 
league,

1159
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:38,141
which is young adult series,
but it's an american profile bullied a 

1160
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:39,460
800 years in the future with aliens 
playing the different positions based on

1161
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:42,110
the physiology.
So you've got like 1500 pound lineman,

1162
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:47,370
you've got receivers and d backs can 
jumped 20 feet in the air and it'S this 

1163
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,260
crazy hodgepodge of stuff.
But uh,

1164
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:51,350
intelligent dolphins are part of that,
that whole thing too.

1165
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,430
So it's a that with the neglect of 
football league series,

1166
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:56,840
which is the rooKie,
the starter,

1167
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:00,110
the allpro in the mvp.
And then the title fight.

1168
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,180
I think I'm one of the few guys is 
merging sports and science fiction 

1169
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,940
because a lot of time the jock is an 
authentic too.

1170
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,220
Science fiction guys don't like the 
jocks very much.

1171
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,180
Yeah.
What is,

1172
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:12,380
uh,
what is that story about?

1173
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,180
A title fight is a,
it's kind of a classic rocky type story,

1174
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:21,470
but there is a heavyweight champion of 
the galaxy and correct the cutter.

1175
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,130
And this is octagon full octagon.
it's straight out.

1176
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:27,350
I'm a huge mma champion of the 
heavyweight champ of the galaxy.

1177
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,490
So in this,
in this,

1178
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:31,250
in this universe,
I have korean sigler verse.

1179
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:34,370
If you're going to be a combat fighter,
you can't have any body modifications.

1180
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,840
It has to be all natural.
So there's no hydro,

1181
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:41,890
no,
no hydraulics or no cybernetics or 

1182
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:43,961
anything like that.
And he is of a race called the quiff 

1183
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:44,000
which have three cats.
There's a leader,

1184
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,140
there's a warrior,
and there's a worker,

1185
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:50,141
kind of an insect tile type approach.
And the warriors have these giant bad 

1186
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:53,231
ass things with an extra set of arms and
they're very mean and very tough and 

1187
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:58,331
they are perennially the champions.
And then along comes this nasty ass 

1188
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:02,180
human fighter named kyle north who comes
out of a place called the purest nation,

1189
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,580
which is in my universe.

1190
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,580
ThiS is the backwater human only world 
where they hate all the alien races and 

1191
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,621
won't get along with anybody,
but they're mean and they're nasty and 

1192
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:14,321
this guy's name is kyle north and he was
created by an author named matt wallace 

1193
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:15,830
who co wrote this with me and matt to ex
pro wreStler.

1194
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:20,831
So he's a,
he's a bad mf and that it's following 

1195
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:22,460
their arcs,
the human who will do anything to be the

1196
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:24,200
champion,
sacrifice his own body,

1197
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,210
kill whoever has got to kill,
make any deal.

1198
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,530
And the highly,
you know,

1199
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:31,580
almost a ronan like the honor honorable 
existing champion.

1200
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,970
And the two different,
two Different mentalities clashed for 

1201
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,211
that final championship ring.
Like the second half of the book is 

1202
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:40,211
nothing but the fight.
It's just a brutal fight.

1203
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:40,980
How big is the human,
uh,

1204
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:42,830
in this,
this is trying to.

1205
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:47,890
I'm trying to track out the growth of 
humans in just the last 50 years in the 

1206
00:52:48,051 --> 00:52:49,580
nfl in Particular,
50 years ago,

1207
00:52:49,581 --> 00:52:51,950
the average nfl lineman weighed 253 
pounds.

1208
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,230
At 253 pounds.
You came to play college ball.

1209
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:57,710
Now these guys like the starting opens,
the line for the dallas cowboys 50 years

1210
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,590
ago could not get a job anywhere in 
football,

1211
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:01,790
probably couldn't even get a 
scholarship.

1212
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:05,420
TheY're just not big enough.
So we've seen the average weight go from

1213
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:07,040
2:53,
somewhere like three,

1214
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:08,180
10,
3:15,

1215
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:10,880
somewhere in that ballpark.
And that's not evolution.

1216
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:16,090
That's just better nutrition and these 
guys getting the opportunity and 

1217
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,361
cultivating the big guys because 50 
years is enough time for evolution to 

1218
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:22,181
kick in,
but eight centuries from now you can 

1219
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:24,371
kind of see that progressing out.
So the main character in the black 

1220
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:24,371
football league name,
quintin barnes,

1221
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,800
he's a quarterback and he's

1222
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,590
seven feet tall,
380 pounds and he's.

1223
00:53:28,591 --> 00:53:29,160
And theY're like,
wow,

1224
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:30,630
he's kind of small.
He could play tight end,

1225
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:32,070
he'd be a small,
tight end and then I'll.

1226
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:35,370
Everybody's exponentially larger based 
on quarterback to lyman.

1227
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,160
So kyle north I think is a in the 
bookies.

1228
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,240
He's six,
eight,

1229
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:44,241
three 80 and that's,
that's the heavyweight champ of the 

1230
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:44,241
world.
Jesus christ,

1231
00:53:44,241 --> 00:53:44,580
you know,
and just just cut too,

1232
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,520
because this is,
this is our cover with them.

1233
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,330
So you know,
just looks like gay porn,

1234
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:52,200
so on it does not want to switch that 
up.

1235
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:55,860
Why is it so hard?
Why is he flexing so hard?

1236
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,480
We grabbed the image and we search for 
mma fighter and all the image sites and 

1237
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,600
that we had a lot of gay part and that's
because all we got like,

1238
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:08,690
you know,
unfortunately and fortunately depending 

1239
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:11,211
on your sexual preference,
I was hoping to find just some gigantic 

1240
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:13,360
like dan severn type dude and none of 
that was available for a million inco.

1241
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,200
One of the greateSt of all time.
He did have a body,

1242
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:21,210
anything like that,
his that looks like a james irvin more 

1243
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,640
but even bigger than james or maybe 
james irvin when he was a heavyweight,

1244
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,670
he was a very muscular mma fighter,
but most guys aren't built like that 

1245
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,060
because it's either you have to have 
extreme genetics to be built like that 

1246
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,900
or you've got to spend too much time 
lifting weights.

1247
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,960
You get more of the law.
I mean you get some really cut zeke's at

1248
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,890
the middleweights and light heavyweight.
Those guys together.

1249
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,290
Not as much.
You know,

1250
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,470
the best guys are longer and leaner,
the really heavily muscled guys.

1251
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,810
It's just too much fuel that those 
bodies require.

1252
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,080
You see,
I'm like a guy like spiders,

1253
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:55,890
spiders,
scott,

1254
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,240
you know he's got that cut.
Yeah.

1255
00:54:57,241 --> 00:55:02,241
Anderson silva is a perfect example of 
what I think is like the ultimate 

1256
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:05,691
fighter body,
but occasionally you'll see a guy who's 

1257
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:06,300
like really thickly muscled at one 85 
and you want to tell them,

1258
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:06,840
man,
listen,

1259
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,610
you need to just get rid of all that 
muscle.

1260
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:11,910
Just do a aerobics exercises only from 
now on.

1261
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,000
You have plenty of muscle.
Just wrestle and kickbox and,

1262
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,850
and run like a lot and drop some weight.
Man,

1263
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,550
you're,
you're hindering yourself by having this

1264
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,230
crazy beach body.
You know,

1265
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:25,290
dee dee,
do you think that affects their fighting

1266
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,480
performance to be overly muscle?
Certainly.

1267
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,280
Absolutely.
It's just not effective.

1268
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:29,920
It's,
it's,

1269
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,780
it's like having too much horsepower and
a car where your,

1270
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:33,990
uh,
your brakes can't.

1271
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,060
Can they,
uh,

1272
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:35,960
you rather your,
uh,

1273
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:39,420
your wheels can't get any traction 
because you're just spinning your wheels

1274
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,150
and then you run out of gas quick.
That's what happens.

1275
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:45,660
If you have too much horsepower car and 
that's how it happens at a person to.

1276
00:55:45,661 --> 00:55:50,661
If you have an overly muscular body,
the resources that requires or 

1277
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:54,710
substantial,
you've got to pump blood through all 

1278
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,780
these extra tissues.
That's serious shit.

1279
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,390
It's a lot of work for your heart,
so you should be,

1280
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:59,430
as you know,
you should be strong,

1281
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:04,431
but as lean as you can be,
just a natural weight close to natural 

1282
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:04,950
weight is great if you can,
if you can,

1283
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,060
if you can compete against the larger 
guys.

1284
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:08,800
Cut.
Wait,

1285
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:14,550
no,
that's been really cool to watch a wc 

1286
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,060
come in the nma.
Actually getting more weight classes 

1287
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:18,060
because I used to,
you know,

1288
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:21,911
I wrestled at 1:26
in college and there was nowhere when 

1289
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:25,580
watching mma,
there's nowhere to see guys have that 

1290
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,681
size at least until wc came along and 
they started to get more of the 

1291
00:56:27,681 --> 00:56:27,810
flyweight in there.
And uh,

1292
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,790
is the ufc going to continue to expand 
all to all the way classes?

1293
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,310
They're thinking about going to 1:15
as well.

1294
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:36,150
We went to one slash 25,
like yes,

1295
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,160
those guys are like,
some people don't like it because they 

1296
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:47,761
say those fights aren't as exciting,
but I think for the most technical 

1297
00:56:47,761 --> 00:56:50,641
fights,
like mighty mouse johnson is one of my 

1298
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:50,641
favorite fighters.

1299
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,610
Demetrius johnson,
he's the flyweight champion and people 

1300
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,230
were saying that are the same people 
like back in ufc one,

1301
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:58,330
two and three when they're like,
you know,

1302
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:00,610
gracie and would be all tied up with 
something like,

1303
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:01,690
well this is an exciting.
I'm like,

1304
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,580
it's because you have no idea what 
you're looking at.

1305
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:07,840
This is mesmerize dan severn fighting 
like gracie is mesmerizing to watch.

1306
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:13,170
I think for some people bigger's better,
especially americans were such 

1307
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:14,140
knuckleheads.
We want to see the biggest guy and we'll

1308
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:17,440
see the biggest gun in the house.
It's like John L.

1309
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,810
Sullivan can look any man in this room,
you know?

1310
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,060
It's like,
that was the say like that lick.

1311
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:27,570
I don't know why.
I don't know why he can't really say 

1312
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:28,650
that.
Now I can look any man in this room,

1313
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:29,560
everybody like,
hey,

1314
00:57:29,561 --> 00:57:31,090
what the fuck you trying to say?
Man,

1315
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:34,350
I think I was six and I got in trouble 
at my grandma's house and my grandmother

1316
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:37,000
was german immigrant and she's like,
I'll give you such a liquid.

1317
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,040
I'm like,
I had no idea what the hell she was 

1318
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,861
talking about.
Like I don't know what's going on 

1319
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:43,861
grandma,
but I'm just going to behave from now on

1320
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,300
because I don't want to crush it.
That's terrifying threat.

1321
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:49,540
Like,
what are you talking about?

1322
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:51,240
Old woman?
I don't know what you mean by that.

1323
00:57:51,241 --> 00:57:54,130
Held me down the liquid.
Get the fuck outta here.

1324
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,470
Yeah.
Um,

1325
00:57:55,570 --> 00:57:56,380
but uh,
for,

1326
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:57,790
um,
for fighters,

1327
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,530
uh,
the,

1328
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:03,550
the,
the correct weight class and going in 

1329
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,150
and,
and fighting a to your,

1330
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:09,151
your optimum weight class can be the 
difference between being a successful 

1331
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:12,751
fighter with a championship career and 
being a guy who never quite rise to the 

1332
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:13,360
top.
Like you see an mma,

1333
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:16,160
there's a few guys that are like sort of
what I call tweeners by.

1334
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:17,680
They're not really a 1:50
fiber.

1335
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,720
They're really too big for that,
but they're really too small for one 

1336
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:22,720
seven.

1337
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,400
Right.
There's a few guys like that that are 

1338
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:25,440
just like somewhere in the middle there.
They shouldn't be like maybe a one slash

1339
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:29,470
65 like bj penn fighting crazy given up 
a lot of ways.

1340
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,030
Yeah,
bj penn and that's his choice.

1341
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,670
Know he just chooses to fight the bigger
guys.

1342
00:58:34,671 --> 00:58:39,671
She's not afraid to fight bigger guys.
And when he was younger and he was able 

1343
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:39,671
to pull it off pretty well,
uh,

1344
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:44,100
but you know,
the game is moving forward and 

1345
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,270
progressing direction constantly.
You're never going to slow down the 

1346
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:49,960
progress of these young guys that are up
and coming.

1347
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,640
They're better,
they're going to be better,

1348
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:53,500
they're going to be better.
They're going to be more technical.

1349
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:58,501
I mean,
it doesn't mean that the older guys 

1350
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,380
can't still when occasionally,
but those guys have to evolve as well.

1351
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:02,050
You see like in boxing,
like bernard hopkins this week,

1352
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:03,030
one of already.

1353
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,440
It's crazy.
I watched it and it's a beautiful 

1354
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,930
performance because he just did 
everything correctly.

1355
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:14,290
He's like such a craftsman in there and 
he's,

1356
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:19,291
you know,
he's got these old school sort of moves 

1357
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:21,920
and just knows how to cover up,
knows where the punches are going before

1358
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,410
you even think about throwing them,
knows what you're going to do,

1359
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:28,460
fines your patterns and then knows how 
to step around you and knows how to keep

1360
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:30,350
you moving.
It was beautiful to watch.

1361
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:35,830
Well,
in mma there's not a whole lot of those 

1362
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,291
guys that are like these old school,
like a perfect fighters.

1363
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,510
You know,
anderson anderson's one of them and then

1364
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,160
you've got a John Jones who's just as 
phenom,

1365
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,660
who's,
although he has all this great success 

1366
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:49,660
really.
He's got so much to learn still too,

1367
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,890
which is the most scary thing about him.
He hasn't even tapped into his branch.

1368
00:59:52,891 --> 00:59:54,290
All right.
You know,

1369
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:59,291
and then the really good guys in the 170
pound division,

1370
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:01,730
that's like six or seven of them.
You know,

1371
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:05,690
like this weekend there's six different 
killers that are fighting in montreal.

1372
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:09,050
They get diaz's fighting.
George st pierre got carlos.

1373
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:12,160
Condit is funny.
Johnny hendricks and jake ellenberger is

1374
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:13,860
fighting jake shields or no?
No,

1375
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:16,430
no.
Jake ellenberger is fighting.

1376
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,130
God dammit.
I got a

1377
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,700
nate marquardt.
That's a,

1378
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:26,480
that's a native may.
Neda,

1379
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,780
ellenberger and uh,
or jake ellenberger and nate marquardt 

1380
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,590
is a sick fight.
That's a.

1381
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,150
Is that all in the same car?
Same car.

1382
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,850
Okay.
Yeah,

1383
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:39,070
that's a lie from montreal.
That's exciting.

1384
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,330
How long have you been an mma fan?

1385
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:43,080
Oh,
for ufc one.

1386
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,090
Really?
Yeah.

1387
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:44,960
Yeah.
Um,

1388
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:50,160
was a big,
big mma fan and it when it was created 

1389
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,160
this crazy spectacle because that's the 
thing like,

1390
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,810
wow,
what a ninja beat up a karate master.

1391
01:00:51,811 --> 01:00:52,950
And like,
and then somebody said,

1392
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:57,951
well,
let's find out and put everybody 

1393
01:00:57,951 --> 01:00:59,271
together.
And I remember watching the early oneS 

1394
01:00:59,271 --> 01:00:59,271
and you know,
this guy's a fifth degree ninjitsu black

1395
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:04,161
belt comes out,
just gets his ass handed to them and a 

1396
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,651
lot of the guy.
And I was excited because I was a 

1397
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,691
wrestler and you were watching this 
early on and I'd never heard of 

1398
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:08,691
brazilian jiu jitsu.
I had no idea what these guys are doing.

1399
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:11,520
But when the wrestlers would come in and
just mop the floor with these dudes,

1400
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,800
and it was exciting for me,
it was justifying.

1401
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:14,340
She's like,
great,

1402
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:19,341
yeah,
I took taekwondo and like there's all 

1403
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:19,341
these forms and I fully appreciate what 
you,

1404
01:01:19,341 --> 01:01:19,800
what did you guys do?

1405
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,000
but the forums,
I don't get it.

1406
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,890
It's going to go flights going to go to 
the ground anyways,

1407
01:01:22,891 --> 01:01:24,900
and you would watch that and mma and the
fight will go to the ground.

1408
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:26,910
The guys know to do things in the ground
with the guys who would win.

1409
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,840
And so really got into it then.
And then when dan severn came out,

1410
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,520
he's a Michigan boy and watching his 
fights with it and he was just,

1411
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:36,420
you know,
awesome.

1412
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,480
Awesome to watch watching him watch,
fight a kickboxer and do full on 

1413
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,600
suplexes on guys who had no idea what a 
suplex was.

1414
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,900
And it was beautiful.
So me and all my wrestling buddies,

1415
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:47,970
we'd get together and watch those and 
just go ape shit.

1416
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
We were just like,
we couldn't even get through one of 

1417
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,000
those without beating the crap out of 
each other.

1418
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,010
It Was,
it was awesome.

1419
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,910
And then to watch it come up and,
and what's happened since dana has taken

1420
01:01:56,911 --> 01:01:58,230
over,
it's just been,

1421
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,060
it's just been one of the coolest things
I've ever seen.

1422
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:00,520
You know,

1423
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:01,180
it's,
yeah,

1424
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:02,370
it's very strange.
Uh,

1425
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,620
as you were talking about the size of 
football players changing,

1426
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,230
uh,
over a period of 50 years.

1427
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,920
Like,
look at how much better the mma fighters

1428
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,350
was in the 20 years that has existed.
It's really shocking.

1429
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,330
It's shocking the scene now like,
uh,

1430
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,930
like diaz and george st pierre,
both of guys to us,

1431
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,830
nobody liked them.
Ten years ago they didn't exist.

1432
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:25,520
Nobody was that good.
These guys are on a complete.

1433
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:28,050
This is the highest level we've ever 
experienced.

1434
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:30,960
And every time st pierre improves,
like he,

1435
01:02:30,961 --> 01:02:35,961
you know,
just be carlos condit had a long time 

1436
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,360
off and re re cooping from his knee 
surgery.

1437
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,360
He recovered from that and has the kind 
of fighter,

1438
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:41,070
good solid,
long,

1439
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,540
tough fight.
Now,

1440
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:45,270
just a couple months later he's going in
there against diaz.

1441
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,700
I love that because I think,
you know,

1442
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,860
since it's only like four months later 
or whatever it is,

1443
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,660
he's got time to recover time to rest up
a bill a little bit and then boom,

1444
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,740
get right back into it.

1445
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,840
So he'll be more use of the experience,
probably put on a better performance,

1446
01:03:00,841 --> 01:03:03,870
won't feel the ring rust as much.
Just experienced it recently.

1447
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,750
That is that enough time for him to,
uh,

1448
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,960
to analyze the other fighters style 
doesn't work it in because they're not 

1449
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:11,960
enormous on the train.
Has gOt to be.

1450
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,620
he's going to do this.
Here's this tendency,

1451
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,660
when he puts his right foot forward,
this is what's going to happen.

1452
01:03:15,661 --> 01:03:20,661
And you think four months is enough time
for him to [inaudible] that guy's f and 

1453
01:03:20,661 --> 01:03:20,661
killer man.
He's both guys are killers,

1454
01:03:20,661 --> 01:03:24,711
but I think first of all,
st pierre has been [inaudible] for a 

1455
01:03:24,711 --> 01:03:25,080
long time because they were supposed to 
fight before,

1456
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:29,940
um,
the as a tested positive and a marijuana

1457
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,630
thing.
And,

1458
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:31,660
you know,
he,

1459
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,960
it took him,
you know,

1460
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,490
all this time before he,
uh,

1461
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,850
was able to get a fight again after the 
condit fight.

1462
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,280
And so,
you know,

1463
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,300
he's uh,
he's had some,

1464
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,270
you know,
a bunch of,

1465
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,220
a bunch of weird issues like outside of 
the cage and that one,

1466
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,810
that one being a big one that they 
suspended him for a long time for,

1467
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:53,790
for marijuana,
which is just really fucking ridiculous.

1468
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,120
That really drives me bananas.
But he's been wanting this fight for 

1469
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:04,010
ever.
Des has been calling out for this fight 

1470
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:06,501
for ever and george st pierre has been 
caged for his fights and talk to you 

1471
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:10,431
about fighting him.
And so these guys have been sizing each 

1472
01:04:10,431 --> 01:04:12,420
other up for a long time.
It's not just four months to get ready.

1473
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,020
This is a long time coming.
We played this yesterday.

1474
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:20,850
There's a video of nick diaz hitting the
speed bag for 23 minutes in a row.

1475
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,220
It's one of the craziest things I've 
ever seen.

1476
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:27,420
He just took 23 minutes.

1477
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:32,510
That is so long.
Most folks have no idea how to get my 

1478
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,430
arms up for 23 minutes and hit the bag 
and he's hammering at it.

1479
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:38,700
I mean,
these guys are both in amazing,

1480
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:41,610
amazing shape.
So I'm so excited about it.

1481
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:43,350
Not just because it's the championship 
fight,

1482
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:48,351
because I think it represents these guys
who are to all time great to my opinion,

1483
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,870
and it represents them in their perfect 
primes.

1484
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:57,060
You know,
they're both in the best situation they 

1485
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,221
could possibly be.
Nick diaz comes off the bj penn fight 

1486
01:04:59,221 --> 01:04:59,221
where,
you know,

1487
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:04,220
fantastic performance to carlos condit 
fight were questionable decision and you

1488
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:04,860
know,
a,

1489
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:09,910
a close fight,
but carlos condit used a very good 

1490
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:13,251
strategy of moving and keeping away from
nick and nick has that aggressive in 

1491
01:05:14,551 --> 01:05:17,170
your face style.
He wants to commit to a fight.

1492
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:22,171
And George George was not dance around.
He doesn't dance around and with his 

1493
01:05:22,171 --> 01:05:25,621
wrestling style as well as it can be a 
really interesting fight because first 

1494
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:26,260
of all,
nick diaz is a nasty guard.

1495
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,260
He's got very good sweeps.
He's got a very good submissions off of 

1496
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,450
his back and it gets real comfortable 
there.

1497
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:33,220
He knows how to tie you up.
You know,

1498
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:33,620
it's,
it's,

1499
01:05:33,621 --> 01:05:37,090
it's not an amateur that you have on his
back and he's dangerous off his back.

1500
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,850
You have to mind your p's and q's and 
then you know,

1501
01:05:39,851 --> 01:05:44,851
it's,
is he going to be able to stop the tape 

1502
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:44,851
down?
If he does stop the take down,

1503
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:45,250
You know,
what is the standup look like?

1504
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:50,370
Does george kick them from the outside?
Does nick pressure him into a standup 

1505
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:50,770
slug fast?
You know what?

1506
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:51,790
What does,
what does it become?

1507
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:53,290
It's going to be fascinating.
I can't wait.

1508
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:54,760
I'm excited for that fight.
Yeah.

1509
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:55,360
I'm,
I'm very,

1510
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:59,710
very excited for as well.
You were like one of the first guys that

1511
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:04,711
I ever heard of that took his books and 
put it on the internet as an audio 

1512
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:06,050
podcast.
What,

1513
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,230
what led you to decide to do that?

1514
01:06:08,430 --> 01:06:11,910
I couldn't get a book deal to frankly 
going back,

1515
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:12,900
I guess,
geez,

1516
01:06:12,901 --> 01:06:17,901
I guess 15,
16 years that I was trying to get 

1517
01:06:17,901 --> 01:06:18,960
published for about 11 or 12 years,
wrIting,

1518
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:21,480
writing a book every two years,
working a full time job,

1519
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:24,450
all the regular stuff,
and then back in the day,

1520
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:29,451
you know,
actually writing the submission letter 

1521
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:29,451
and sending it to publisher,
sending it to agents,

1522
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:29,451
going to conventions,
trying to meet,

1523
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,950
make the right connections to get just 
to get somebody look at the book.

1524
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,480
And I got an agent and uh,
I,

1525
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,500
I wound up with a deal with the aol time
warner when my book earthcorps was 

1526
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,160
supposed to be in every store in may of 
2002.

1527
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,480
And then the 9:11
recession hit before it went to press 

1528
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:52,040
in.
The economy drops in time warner 

1529
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,040
scrapped everything that wasn't 
profitable.

1530
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:54,741
So I'd,
I'd gotten to that point where I had a 

1531
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:54,741
book deal.

1532
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:57,060
Then the publisher folded,
it happens and it took me three years to

1533
01:06:57,061 --> 01:07:02,061
get the rights back to my book.
So now when I get the rights back in 

1534
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:02,610
2005,
I have this professionally edited book.

1535
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,130
The other's name was Paul Witt.
Cover was a great guy.

1536
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:10,370
it was a really.
I thought it was really solid piece of 

1537
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:11,070
work and we can't get another book deal 
for it.

1538
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:16,430
Then I learned about podcasting,
see what dave winer and Adam Curry or 

1539
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:16,470
dealing with podcasting and I'm like,
oh,

1540
01:07:16,471 --> 01:07:17,970
that's really cool.
Serialized stuff.

1541
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
So I went to look for audio books to 
listen to because the first thing that 

1542
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,751
happened,
my head being a writer was somebody 

1543
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:26,751
putting out serialized books just like 
the radio dramas,

1544
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,700
the forties and fifties.
I started googling it and after two days

1545
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:32,880
of trying to figure out what I'm doing 
wrong to google it and I can't find any,

1546
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,910
I then realized nobody has done this 
yet.

1547
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:41,300
And at that point I'm like,
I've got a professionally edited book 

1548
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,300
and it was ready for mass market 
production.

1549
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,020
Here's thIs new technology that if 
somebody hears an episode,

1550
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,270
they can immediately,
instant message it to a friend,

1551
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:50,310
email it to a friend,
chat room it,

1552
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,890
and anybody who clicks on that is going 
to start hearing the story right away.

1553
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,740
I've got speed of light marketing with 
this and it speed of light,

1554
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:57,300
word of mouth,
and then I'm like,

1555
01:07:57,330 --> 01:08:00,150
shit.
And I figured out how to record,

1556
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:05,151
how to make an rss feed,
how to make a website and got it all 

1557
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:07,521
done just so I could get out there and 
then puts some marketing to work like 

1558
01:08:07,521 --> 01:08:10,641
the first guy to ever do a podcast,
only novel and hope it will get picked 

1559
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:11,160
up by some blogs and different sites.
And it did.

1560
01:08:11,161 --> 01:08:12,510
And I started to get a followership.

1561
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:18,020
And uh,
when I got to the end earthcorps I had 

1562
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,740
three other books done and I just 
started podcasting them.

1563
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:23,741
And I've been going ever since.
So I was of the mind that if the 

1564
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:28,991
publishers are the gatekeepers and they 
won't let me in because it's not a 

1565
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:29,360
western,
it's not a horror story.

1566
01:08:29,361 --> 01:08:34,361
It's not a vampire story.
They want very specific things they can 

1567
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:34,361
sell.
You've got a lot of different genres.

1568
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:36,350
They don't like you very much.
I was like,

1569
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:39,310
if I can get to the end user,
if I can go to the end listener and show

1570
01:08:39,311 --> 01:08:44,311
him how kick ass my stuff really is.
I'm betting money that my shit is so 

1571
01:08:44,311 --> 01:08:48,041
good,
I can give it to you for free and then 

1572
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:48,041
they'll still pay for it.
Anyways,

1573
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:51,160
that was the thought process and I 
thought I would get a lot of followers 

1574
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:51,160
and a lot of followers would turn into a
book deal.

1575
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:56,170
Initially.
That didn't happen because I was going 

1576
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,170
to publish.
I have 10,000

1577
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,440
people listening meet every sunday.
How can you not put this out?

1578
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,880
And and their question is,
well,

1579
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,370
what's a podcast?
They had no idea what it was like,

1580
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,750
here's verifiable stats.
They didn't.

1581
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,370
They didn't know what the internet was.
They had no idea.

1582
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,840
They didn't know what the internet was.
They,

1583
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,530
I swear,
got it.

1584
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:07,730
They didn't know what that happened in 
and it was,

1585
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:12,731
and it was ms dot.
I thought I had this awesome plan and 

1586
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:15,611
everything's gonna work out great and I 
get to the point where I'm supposed to 

1587
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:18,101
get the contract and get the book deal 
and they didn't care about the podcast 

1588
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:21,791
at all,
so then I just kept on doing it and 

1589
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,471
eventually things kinda caught up.
Finally at the end of the story is we 

1590
01:09:23,471 --> 01:09:25,220
put out that novel ancestor as a print 
book.

1591
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:27,950
The one you've got is the one that's 
been rewritten for random house,

1592
01:09:27,951 --> 01:09:32,951
but this was just a little little trade 
paperback put out by a small canadian 

1593
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:33,470
imprint.
One lady working out of her garage,

1594
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,210
we put that out on April 1st,
2007 and it was the number one or number

1595
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:41,960
one scifi book and amazon and it was the
number two fiction book on amazon behind

1596
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:44,290
one of the Harry Potter potter novels.
Wow.

1597
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,100
In New York,
cracked an egg roll.

1598
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:48,740
I mean it was.
It was awesome because I had a new agent

1599
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:51,230
at that point who had the book infected 
on their desks and people are like,

1600
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,680
oh,
this is it.

1601
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:52,730
We like this.
This is good.

1602
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:58,030
Then all of a sudden this guy that 
they've never heard of anywhere is 

1603
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,160
number one and for number one inside,
and then that got us into an auction for

1604
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:03,170
infected and then I've been rolling ever
since.

1605
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,970
wow.
That's amazing.

1606
01:10:04,971 --> 01:10:06,410
What an awesome story.
Yeah.

1607
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,900
So you're sorT of self created.
Very,

1608
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:12,140
very much self graded.
There's a love stories like that.

1609
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,090
A lot of it,
a lot of it is my,

1610
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:14,870
uh,
my audience.

1611
01:10:14,871 --> 01:10:16,730
so a lot of the day when I was,
all right,

1612
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,560
we're going to go sell this book on this
day,

1613
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,360
spread the word,
and they went out and spread the word.

1614
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,390
And this is the audience that you 
created with this blog or this podcast 

1615
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,710
of your novels.
Did you profit off of it?

1616
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:31,720
how did you have it setup?
Did you have to pay for it to download 

1617
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:31,720
it?
Like,

1618
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,240
no,
it's always been free from square one.

1619
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,190
The whole book is free.
The whole book is free.

1620
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:39,191
that's the model we have now is if you 
just want it for free or you can't 

1621
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:43,541
afford it.
And you liked the story because 

1622
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:43,541
everybody gets into pickles here and 
there.

1623
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,080
You can listen to every episode every 
week and you can get the whole thing for

1624
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:47,360
free.
If you download a book I've done before,

1625
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:52,570
you're going to hear 30 episodes with an
ad inserted before every episode just 

1626
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:52,820
like what you do,
so it's going to be ad supported,

1627
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:54,590
free content,
and you can listen to it.

1628
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,190
If you don't want to hear me talk before
the episode and you don't hear the ads,

1629
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,440
then you can go spend money and buy the 
audio book,

1630
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:02,030
so I totally leave it up to the 
audience.

1631
01:11:02,031 --> 01:11:03,530
If you want to buy the printer by the 
ebook,

1632
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:05,510
you can do that.
You want to buy the audio book?

1633
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,070
Absolutely.
That's why we're in business.

1634
01:11:07,071 --> 01:11:08,720
If you don't want to do that or you 
can't afford it,

1635
01:11:08,721 --> 01:11:10,670
you can go get all my books,
every word of it for free.

1636
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,770
EveryThing on abridged way.
It's been from square one.

1637
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,100
That's a beautiful way to do it,

1638
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:19,100
man,
so that way you pay for the bandwidth 

1639
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:19,100
costs and all that stuff.
Through the advertising,

1640
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:24,350
everything we've covered everything with
the advertising and advertising has 

1641
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,780
become a a solid,
solid thing for us.

1642
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,550
After seven years we're doing pretty 
good with it.

1643
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,410
Um,
but largely it's just the,

1644
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,860
the general attitude by this whole thing
has been,

1645
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,700
I don't think anyone out there mind 
spending money for shit that they like.

1646
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:40,080
The problem Is when you buy that record 
or you buy that audio book and you heard

1647
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:40,770
the sampling,
you're like,

1648
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:41,340
well,
that was great.

1649
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,780
Then you get to the end of it and you're
like,

1650
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,710
this guy got lazy.
This,

1651
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,040
this story ends crappy.
I have wasted my time.

1652
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,170
I've wasted my money.
You're pissed off,

1653
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,900
angry that you spent money on something 
that you didn't like.

1654
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:56,930
So I flipped that like,
I'm going to give it to you and you're 

1655
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:56,930
gonna.

1656
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:56,930
Listen to it and when you get to the 
end,

1657
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:59,620
you are going to miss work and you are 
going to go all night long and not,

1658
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,770
not be able to sleep because I'm in your
skull,

1659
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:04,020
taken over.
And then when they get done lIke that,

1660
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,910
I liked that book.
I liked the way that ended.

1661
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,940
This is my author.
Then they go buy everything that I've 

1662
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,491
ever made.
And if people get to the end and they 

1663
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:13,491
didn't like it,
it's no sweat off anybody's ball.

1664
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:13,491
It's like,
well,

1665
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:15,060
I didn't spend anything on.
It's not really for me.

1666
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:20,250
It creates this sense of uh,
this crazy sense of goodwill that even 

1667
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:22,980
people who don't really like your stuff,
as soon as they hear somebody going,

1668
01:12:22,981 --> 01:12:23,320
oh,
you know,

1669
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,360
I,
I really like a hard science monster 

1670
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:28,360
stories.
Like,

1671
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:28,360
oh,
you got to check out the sigler guy.

1672
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,930
And like it,
everybody loves the fact that you leave 

1673
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:31,930
it up to the customer and just leave it 
up to.

1674
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:32,550
It's up to them.
It's their money.

1675
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:34,440
You decided you want to spend it or not.
It's not up to me to trick you.

1676
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,330
That's an awesome ethic.
I love that.

1677
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:39,420
And that's sort of the same thing we do 
with this podcast.

1678
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:44,421
We know there's some people hAve like 
they have where you sign up and you can 

1679
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:48,810
pay x amount of money and access the old
podcasts and some of them have it set up

1680
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,530
where if you want to watch on ustream,
you've got to pay for a monthly thing.

1681
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:57,531
but I've always felt like what this 
thing does is so amazing is the word of 

1682
01:12:57,531 --> 01:13:02,271
mouth and the best way to do that is to 
make it as accessible as possible,

1683
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,120
to put it out there as quickly and as 
easy and as to make to make it as 

1684
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:08,880
downloadable as possible.
I mean,

1685
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:13,881
if going back to Stephen King,
Stephen King was a start doing a weekly 

1686
01:13:13,881 --> 01:13:14,580
podcast of his fiction and actually read
his fiction,

1687
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:15,750
he's.

1688
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,960
He could charge for that and would make 
a significant amount of money for that.

1689
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:23,770
Stephen king's the worst guy ever to 
reasonable.

1690
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,970
His books are awesome,
but when he's reading them,

1691
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:27,570
I'm like,
oh,

1692
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:30,210
this mother fuckers read books.
Not his thing.

1693
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:31,620
He's not.
He's not.

1694
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:33,480
He doesn't command it enough.
I don't know.

1695
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:38,481
Maybe you have a strong voice.
Stephen king has sort of most like a 

1696
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:43,120
mumbling voice while he's reading his 
family are,

1697
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:45,270
would never be able to pull it off.
Well,

1698
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:48,630
the performance of the book,
I've had seven years to polish that up.

1699
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:49,950
when I started out.
The first one earthcorps.

1700
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:54,951
It's like I just use all the voices they
used to use to make my buddies laughed 

1701
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:55,320
in high school and like I have no idea 
what I'm doing.

1702
01:13:55,321 --> 01:14:00,321
Just throw it in there and we'll make it
as entertaining as possible and I've 

1703
01:14:00,321 --> 01:14:00,810
alwaYs tried to be as make.
Every book is over the top as it can be.

1704
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:04,140
So there's a loud rock intro,
loud rock outros.

1705
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:09,141
I'm peaking the meters when I'm talking 
and just trying to make it exciting and 

1706
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:09,480
energetic and fun.
He's not just money.

1707
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:11,430
It's people's time.
You're going to take an hour,

1708
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,010
somebody time.

1709
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,590
You better have some good shit because 
they can't get that hour back ever.

1710
01:14:14,690 --> 01:14:16,570
Dude.
You're saying all the right shit.

1711
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,120
I love you.
That's how you should think,

1712
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,490
man.
It would be awesome if everybody thought

1713
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:26,491
that was the biggest thing is the free 
because now there's so many 

1714
01:14:26,491 --> 01:14:27,040
entertainment options.
You know when Stephen King was coming up

1715
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:29,110
in the seventies,
there was movies,

1716
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:33,150
books and tv and that was all there was 
and now I got to compete against fucking

1717
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:38,280
xbox and playstation and downloaded 
content and podcasts and vid cast and 

1718
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,790
youtube.
I got to compete against all that just 

1719
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:41,790
to try and get somebody to get like,
yeah,

1720
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:42,770
I'm going to go and ask for 10 hours of 
your time to read this,

1721
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,530
this book.
That doesn't really mean anything.

1722
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,470
That's a tough sell today.
That's a super tough sell,

1723
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:52,471
especially with the younger kids because
video games are amazing entertainment 

1724
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:52,471
experiences,
you know,

1725
01:14:52,471 --> 01:14:55,270
for you to get them to put that down and
pick this book up for awhile,

1726
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:56,590
you've really got.

1727
01:14:56,650 --> 01:15:01,650
You got to bring good stuff.
How many hours do you think it would 

1728
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:01,650
take to rebuild these books?
You can read one of these and 10 hours.

1729
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:02,560
I think somebody could read it.
Ten,

1730
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,950
10 to 20 hours.
Yeah,

1731
01:15:04,020 --> 01:15:05,980
10 to 20.
My stuff reads a little.

1732
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:11,090
It's.
It's looks thicker than it is because 

1733
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,501
there's an enormous amount of dialogue.
There's a lot of regular guy dialogue 

1734
01:15:13,501 --> 01:15:13,970
and that means like two,
three words,

1735
01:15:13,971 --> 01:15:14,740
line two,
three words,

1736
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:15,280
line pop up,
up,

1737
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:15,580
up,
up.

1738
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:18,730
Stuff goes real fast.
So people are surprised at how fast they

1739
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:21,040
read it.
Like this giant hunking thing.

1740
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,110
They're like,
I can't believe I finished it so fast,

1741
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:23,580
and I'm like,
well,

1742
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:25,780
there's an enormous amount of dialogue 
in there.

1743
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,230
And this other book that I have here is 
ancestor.

1744
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:29,440
WhaT?
What's this one about?

1745
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,270
Ancestor is,
um,

1746
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:35,980
an effort by a biotech company to create
a herd animal with transplantable horn,

1747
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:36,730
human organs.

1748
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:42,360
Every year,
hundreds of thousands of people die 

1749
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:42,360
because there's just not enough organs 
to go around.

1750
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,060
And if you've got a bad liver for you to
live,

1751
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:45,010
somebody else has to die.
It's a zero sum game.

1752
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:48,130
So they try and come up with a camera.
It's a,

1753
01:15:48,131 --> 01:15:50,710
it's an animal with jeans from multiple 
species.

1754
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:53,440
So basically something along the lines 
of a sheep or a cow.

1755
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,690
But with transplantable,
lungs,

1756
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:56,860
liver,
kidneys,

1757
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:01,980
everything.
A growing body could need if they can 

1758
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:01,980
pull this off and put this thing out to 
pasture.

1759
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,510
It's just like raising cows.
You just harvest them when you need them

1760
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:09,511
and you make trillions of dollars.
This is old school horror movie saifai.

1761
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:14,790
So something goes horribly wrong and 
instead of winding up with a 200 pound 

1762
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:19,051
hurt animal with a perfectly 
transplantable organs and is that goes 

1763
01:16:19,051 --> 01:16:22,801
out and eats grass,
they wind up with a 650 pound pack 

1764
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:24,970
predator and this of course happens on a
remote island in lake superior.

1765
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,970
So we wind up with all of our,
all of our characters stuck on an island

1766
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:32,990
with 100 of these 650 pound pack 
predators that just go through you like 

1767
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:34,300
they go through like a knife through 
butter.

1768
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,400
These things look like they,
uh,

1769
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:41,430
they're not all that dissimilar from the
american werewolf in london and got out 

1770
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:45,600
out there.
But the biggest thing I did with the 

1771
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:45,730
night kind of combined,
I'm a little bit of a bar,

1772
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:49,660
a bear and a gorilla,
but the defining thing they have in fans

1773
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:51,820
draw tons of pictures of the feed.
Google sigler,

1774
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,980
sigler ancestry.
You'll probably see this.

1775
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:59,370
they have this giant sale thing.
So they've got a variation on the 

1776
01:16:59,370 --> 01:16:59,370
demetra non-cell fin because it's based 
on.

1777
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:02,230
The genome is based on the ancestor of 
all mammals.

1778
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:06,010
The thought is if they read,
dial back the genetic clock,

1779
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:11,040
let's get back to the base set of code,
then we will have exactly what we want 

1780
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,140
and there won't be any dashes,
retroviruses,

1781
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,690
there won't be any,
any crazy stuff we can then from there,

1782
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:16,280
customize the animal we want.

1783
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,930
Right,
and they.

1784
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,970
But they don't get it all the way.
Right.

1785
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,080
The thing is is that that's one of the 
things it says that's from predator.

1786
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:29,081
Scroll back over to the left.
That's one of my fans did a full four 

1787
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:31,280
foot tall mock out of the thing.
That's the monster right there,

1788
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,670
and they had the sale fan that they keep
back and you and you start to find out,

1789
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:39,671
they start to use it for communication,
so they signal each other when they're 

1790
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:40,350
closing in on you.
So if you see that fin pop up somewhere,

1791
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,260
the kind of like a land shark,
your efin screwed.

1792
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:46,100
You're pretty fully there.
Fully cgi in the trailer.

1793
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,780
You want to get the trailer out there.
That's.

1794
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:49,100
Yeah,
someone's cgi.

1795
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:52,010
This my buddy kevin copysea,
who's amazingly talented.

1796
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,790
Look for a go to youtube and search for 
sigler nocturnal trailer,

1797
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:01,120
and so you're doing a a movie of 
nocturnal but ancestors to sigler 

1798
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:02,240
ancestor trailer.
Excuse me.

1799
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:07,241
Yeah.
Ancestor or this is going to be a tv 

1800
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:07,241
series.
What is going on with ancestor?

1801
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:08,390
Nothing right now have been a couple 
people have been like,

1802
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,150
yeah,
I do trailers for the books.

1803
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:14,060
Again,
trying to compete against youtube.

1804
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:19,180
You've got to be on youtube.
The thing with a book trailer is if you 

1805
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,881
make a really kick ass book trailer and 
it's the kind of thing that people will 

1806
01:18:21,881 --> 01:18:24,881
share,
the money you spend on that is money 

1807
01:18:24,881 --> 01:18:26,810
that will continue to work for you.
People keep watching that for years.

1808
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:28,550
Three,
four minutes,

1809
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,850
someone dies while waiting for a heart.
Liver,

1810
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,310
a kidney.

1811
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:34,620
Okay.

1812
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:39,890
Imagine the technology that could 
provide those organs for a fee and 

1813
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:42,330
imagine what a company would do to 
monopolize that technology.

1814
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:48,030
The biotech firm,
janata tried to solve this problem by 

1815
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:51,711
creating the ancestor,
a creature with transplantable human 

1816
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:56,331
ordinance,
but they didn't get the dos style 

1817
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,110
hurting thing.
Instead,

1818
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:03,440
awakened something,
something something very,

1819
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:09,440
very.
You want a monopoly monopoly on human 

1820
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:19,850
life.
Nothing sells like life itself.

1821
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:27,110
When we succeed,
we will be the only vendor and be able 

1822
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:31,941
to charge what the market will bear for 
the millions of people.

1823
01:19:32,821 --> 01:19:34,140
Not quite ready for that.
Yes.

1824
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,780
The market will bear.
That's my favorite part.

1825
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:17,880
I don't know what that is.
That's sure as fuck ain't no cow.

1826
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:25,260
So you created that yourself?
No,

1827
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:30,310
we.
We had people do the errand proctor a 

1828
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,590
shot the thing,
but we went out and found a guy to do it

1829
01:20:30,591 --> 01:20:34,090
and he got all his actor friends and put
it together in the cgi and we got a.

1830
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,760
We got permission from century media to 
use in this moments.

1831
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:37,760
Music for it.
We shot it.

1832
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:43,020
We assume that five minute movie we went
out in the mountains and the snow and 

1833
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,060
had an f and blast doing it,
but that kind of thing.

1834
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,530
People still watch that,
you know,

1835
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,520
were from 30,
40,

1836
01:20:46,521 --> 01:20:51,521
50 times a day.
My trailer for infected at a quarter of 

1837
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:52,340
a million views and it just keeps 
getting views.

1838
01:20:52,341 --> 01:20:57,341
So somebody's going to watch that and 
that's exactly the kind of book they 

1839
01:20:57,341 --> 01:20:57,341
want.
Then they go buy the book.

1840
01:20:57,341 --> 01:21:02,170
It's the only form of marketing and the 
publishing industry that will continue 

1841
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:02,170
to sell books for you year after year.

1842
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,830
So we go out and spend.
I spent a ton of money in my trailers.

1843
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,240
What?
That's really interesting.

1844
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,500
Is this a common thing?
Am I just.

1845
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,320
It's getting more leads.
Getting more common.

1846
01:21:09,321 --> 01:21:11,090
Yeah.
And a lot of book trailers are.

1847
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:16,300
They're awful.
It's a floating book cover with music 

1848
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,941
and words floating in.
But there's people who go out and just 

1849
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:18,941
shoot them.
I mean,

1850
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:22,991
they do full on three,
four minute movies to try and sell the 

1851
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:22,991
book.
Have you seen one of these brands?

1852
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:26,250
Have you ever seen one?
Jamie for this app is.

1853
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,670
Yeah.
Wow.

1854
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,290
I've never heard that.
That's fascinating.

1855
01:21:30,291 --> 01:21:34,070
We did the first one in 2008 and it was 
a relatively unheard of.

1856
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:34,960
Now it's more common now.

1857
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,820
Professional writer and a man.
I need you to explain to me 50 shades of

1858
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:40,120
grey.

1859
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:43,190
Fuck.
What the fuck is going on?

1860
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,210
It's the naughty factor.
I think it's,

1861
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:47,360
it's a I think,
and I'm guessing here,

1862
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:50,030
so I'm trying to figure out primarily 
that's a female readership,

1863
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:55,090
trying to figure out the female mind,
which is not something I'm that gift of 

1864
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:55,090
that,
but

1865
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:56,150
or gay dudes pretending to be straight.
They might read that.

1866
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,100
I don't know,
but I think number one,

1867
01:21:59,101 --> 01:21:59,950
it's,
it's,

1868
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:05,930
it's not your usual sexy.
This is some stuff we read and he'd be 

1869
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:05,930
like,
oh my goodness,

1870
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:09,441
I can you put that in a book and then at
some point it tipped and enough people 

1871
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:11,100
had read it that it became,
okay,

1872
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,320
you've got the hive mentality.
Well,

1873
01:22:13,321 --> 01:22:15,450
got a million people read this.
It's not that bad.

1874
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:19,260
And then the other factor that I think 
everybody just ignores is,

1875
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:20,520
I haven't read it,
but I.

1876
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:25,590
It's probably a great book.
It does not sell that many copies unless

1877
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:30,591
that writing specifically appeals to the
people who are buying it and they love 

1878
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:30,591
the reading experience.

1879
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:34,860
One of the reasons why women don't trust
porn stars are strippers or prostitutes 

1880
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:39,350
or you know,
other women that you know,

1881
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:44,351
will do things along those lines from 
money is because secretly I think 

1882
01:22:44,351 --> 01:22:49,181
there's a fear in the female community 
that all would have to happen would be 

1883
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:53,990
just a few hundred girls start doing 
terrible things.

1884
01:22:53,991 --> 01:22:58,991
Then they would all start doing it as a 
sort of a mass movement and when a book 

1885
01:22:58,991 --> 01:23:03,620
like 50 shades of grey comes on and it's
ball gags and you know,

1886
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:06,070
all the crazy shit that doing that in

1887
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,750
that book,
go back to the terrible part.

1888
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:12,790
What's shit,
what's terrible about a 200 girls going 

1889
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,790
out and having a grand old time?
Nothing terrible.

1890
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:17,610
I mean terrible from their point of view
and their own social norms of,

1891
01:23:17,640 --> 01:23:19,900
you know,
not wanting to be a slut and not wanting

1892
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:24,700
to be promiscuous.
And in a book like 50 shades of gray can

1893
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:29,970
literally change culture.
I'm sure you got hold of sex and the 

1894
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:29,970
city sex and the city.
Same thing.

1895
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:34,820
I bet.
I bet the sales of bondage instruments 

1896
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:35,860
have gone up significantly since that 
book has come out.

1897
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:40,920
Well,
you think about women in like the 

1898
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:40,920
nineties,
like before sex and the city came along.

1899
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,360
It was like sort of like there was no 
milf world.

1900
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:44,360
There was no,
you know,

1901
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:49,380
there was no.
People weren't like really turned on by 

1902
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:49,380
really hot,
50 year olds like that.

1903
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:51,640
That didn't exist.
There was none of that and then all of a

1904
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:55,090
sudden it became okay and then all these
women that were like over 40,

1905
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:55,670
it was like,
fuck it,

1906
01:23:55,671 --> 01:24:00,671
I'm getting divorced.
I'm going to go out and get some dick 

1907
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:00,671
hanging out with my friends.
I don't like hanging out with many them.

1908
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:04,030
Somewhere along the line they realized 
their marriage is a big charade.

1909
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:08,170
I think we're,
we're seeing more,

1910
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:13,171
especially a lot of the porn stars being
more open about what they do and going 

1911
01:24:13,171 --> 01:24:13,810
on their own podcasts and talking about 
like,

1912
01:24:13,811 --> 01:24:14,610
yeah,
this is my job here.

1913
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:19,620
This is super fun.
People are accepting it more and more 

1914
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:19,620
interested in a book like 50 shades of 
grey.

1915
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:24,390
Hopefully the norms of our parents are 
are going away and somebody wants to go 

1916
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,410
get laid and the other person's into it.
What's the problem?

1917
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,760
Nobody's getting hurt.
Yeah.

1918
01:24:27,761 --> 01:24:29,380
Unless you ball gags.
I'm real tight.

1919
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,950
Yeah.
Give her strain.

1920
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,250
Sooner or later,
the uh,

1921
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:37,420
autoerotic asphyxiation is gonna kick in
and somebody's gonna strangle get choked

1922
01:24:37,421 --> 01:24:38,350
to death.
And that's sad.

1923
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:41,170
Whenever anybody dies from auto erotic 
association,

1924
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:43,130
I always smell foul play.
I was like,

1925
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:43,780
whoa,
totally.

1926
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,300
You were going to figure out a way to 
discredit a guy.

1927
01:24:46,301 --> 01:24:48,700
Like there was a preacher that died and 
he died.

1928
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:53,701
He had a wet suit on.
He had a black dildo up his ass and he 

1929
01:24:53,701 --> 01:24:55,630
was doing a autoerotic creation and he 
died.

1930
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:57,910
And that guy,
I was figured,

1931
01:24:57,911 --> 01:24:58,840
well,
you know what?

1932
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:04,020
That guy is a priest.
Who knows what kind of creepy shit he 

1933
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,020
did.
You know,

1934
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:04,840
it's probably not a stupid priest,
you know what I mean?

1935
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:06,130
Come on.
Very well.

1936
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,750
Stupid.
That's a good way to whack someone.

1937
01:25:07,751 --> 01:25:08,290
Absolutely.

1938
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:09,280
Yeah.
But it's a good way.

1939
01:25:09,281 --> 01:25:11,530
I mean,
it's like as embarrassing as possible.

1940
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,560
Yeah.
The only difference is like you could 

1941
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,081
make it a little worse by leaving like 
pornography around like gay porn or 

1942
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:19,500
kiddie porn or something like that.
You crossed me.

1943
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:24,510
I'm elite kiddie porn all around you.
You're going to die about his fixation 

1944
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:24,510
mop,
mop mafia,

1945
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:25,540
threatening that.
It'll make something straightened out.

1946
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:30,570
Well,
they said that's what happened with 

1947
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,651
david carradine that I heard.
I thought the same thought when that 

1948
01:25:31,651 --> 01:25:31,660
happened.
I'm like,

1949
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:34,870
I don't give a shit what anybody does in
their own private time,

1950
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:37,630
but I'm not buying that.
He crossed someone.

1951
01:25:37,660 --> 01:25:42,660
He had to have crossed someone or owed 
somebody money or something because it 

1952
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:42,660
was just nuts.
Well,

1953
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:46,441
the rumor was that there were some 
organized crime involvement in his 

1954
01:25:46,441 --> 01:25:46,450
death.
That was the rumor.

1955
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:49,090
The rumor somebody easily could have 
just made that up.

1956
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:51,430
I mean,
this is so many goddamn rumors,

1957
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,960
so implausible that,
that you do that and.

1958
01:25:55,220 --> 01:25:56,980
But I've never.
I've tried.

1959
01:25:56,981 --> 01:26:01,981
Maybe it's the greatest thing ever.
I'm never going to find us to be 

1960
01:26:01,981 --> 01:26:03,961
awesome,
but it's not my cup of tea having 

1961
01:26:03,961 --> 01:26:03,961
supposed to be great to.
I'm not going to do that either.

1962
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,850
Brian's dad was trying to get talked 
into skydiving.

1963
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:08,900
Tell that story.

1964
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,440
Yeah.
His friend was always like,

1965
01:26:11,441 --> 01:26:13,000
hey,
you gotta go skydiving with me guy.

1966
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,500
Go skydiving.
Skydiving with me.

1967
01:26:14,501 --> 01:26:16,130
And then one day,
uh,

1968
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,350
she,
her,

1969
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:18,640
her,
her,

1970
01:26:18,641 --> 01:26:22,450
a parachute got tangled up with her 
emergency parachute.

1971
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:23,380
Oh,
she died.

1972
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,480
And this was like a week before he was 
going to go skydiving with her.

1973
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,930
Yeah.
So yeah,

1974
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,210
not for me.
No.

1975
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:32,720
Did he find out by just going into work 
and she wasn't there?

1976
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,860
Yeah.
Whoops.

1977
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,850
Not for me.
More power to the people want to do it,

1978
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:38,790
but not,
not for me.

1979
01:26:38,850 --> 01:26:40,560
I avoid the crazy life threatening 
stuff.

1980
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:41,640
Yeah,
that's a,

1981
01:26:41,641 --> 01:26:45,240
that's a funny one though.
Skydiving one's a really funny one.

1982
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:47,490
It's like you want that big adrenaline 
rush.

1983
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,500
Wait till they come up with virtual 
skydiving.

1984
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,150
That sounds like it's going to be pretty
bad ass.

1985
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,480
Well,
there's a little fan things,

1986
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:57,600
some pretty fun.
Have you ever done one of those where 

1987
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:57,600
you're like over that big fan and you're
just kinda like,

1988
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:57,600
yeah.

1989
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,600
Floating that said it's amazing.
Yeah.

1990
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,140
They have one.
The universal.

1991
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:02,090
We should do it one day.
Yeah,

1992
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:02,780
that'd be great.
Hey,

1993
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:03,870
you fly.
Yeah.

1994
01:27:03,980 --> 01:27:08,980
It's just like a technique to it too 
apparently because if you do it a 

1995
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:12,021
certain way you can fall.
Does that give you the same drastic 

1996
01:27:12,021 --> 01:27:12,090
fight or flight response though as 
looking out,

1997
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:13,740
jumping out of a plane?
You're like,

1998
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:15,650
if anything goes wrong,
I'm going to die.

1999
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,610
That's the thrill I got to think for 
these people.

2000
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,660
Yeah,
absolutely.

2001
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,250
That's,
that's a big part of it.

2002
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,350
So it's the part that people don't want 
to,

2003
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,160
they don't want to sort of admit it to.
It's a thrill.

2004
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,810
What's the thrill part?
Well,

2005
01:27:27,811 --> 01:27:29,580
the thrill is that you're almost dying.
Yeah.

2006
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,550
You're gonna,
you're gonna add,

2007
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:33,750
bungee jump at the same thing.
Your body is reacting like it's going to

2008
01:27:33,751 --> 01:27:35,700
die and you're tricking that.

2009
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:37,800
Yeah,
but not really.

2010
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:39,570
Like you're pretty sure it's not going 
to.

2011
01:27:39,571 --> 01:27:42,270
So it's not a full on,
I'm going to die moment.

2012
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:43,980
Well you only make that mistake once,
then it's,

2013
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,640
you're,
you're all set.

2014
01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:47,700
Yeah.
We're weird with our manipulation of our

2015
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:50,770
fight or flight responses.
The things we do,

2016
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:54,210
wing suits and shit like that fucking 
you know,

2017
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:57,570
organized,
fighting the same thing you are.

2018
01:27:57,571 --> 01:28:02,571
You are channeling that base primitive 
instinct to establish dominance over 

2019
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:05,190
another member of your species.
It's just the.

2020
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:10,250
All of the things that used to go with 
that in primitive times are gone and 

2021
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:13,281
it's just down to that one instinct.
You are going in there to test your 

2022
01:28:13,281 --> 01:28:15,000
mettle against another person and a and 
see if you can beat them.

2023
01:28:15,030 --> 01:28:20,030
If you can establish dominance on them.
That's all that stuff is and the guys 

2024
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:23,481
who are the best that establishing 
dominance of the guys who rise to 

2025
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:23,481
prominence in their,
in their sport and we're starting to see

2026
01:28:23,481 --> 01:28:25,530
younger and younger guys retire as well.

2027
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:30,710
That's good.
That's being an issue now is a very 

2028
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:33,970
tiring because they've already got 
damaged to the retaining ahead of 

2029
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:33,970
damage.
Well,

2030
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:33,970
everybody's got a certain amount of 
damage.

2031
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:38,661
That's the reality.
The reality is if you've done some 

2032
01:28:38,661 --> 01:28:39,440
hearts bar and you've got damaged,
it's just no.

2033
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:41,280
So it doesn't seem like there's any 
getting around that.

2034
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:44,390
I mean,
how much of it recovers after you know?

2035
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,470
A couple of months.
How much is a couple of weeks?

2036
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:51,471
How much has never depends.
I've seen fights where guys got beat up 

2037
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:55,880
and they were never the same guy again.
They just weren't that they're missing 

2038
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:55,970
something.
They were at,

2039
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:57,960
if they were at 10 before they were at 
eight,

2040
01:28:57,961 --> 01:28:58,980
now,
you know,

2041
01:28:58,981 --> 01:29:02,010
and that was where they were now and 
they could have a fairly successful

2042
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,050
career at eight,
but they would never be 10 again.

2043
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:09,230
Now that's something the nfl is facing 
because they've got 100 years of results

2044
01:29:10,051 --> 01:29:11,790
to look at.
But for something like the ufc,

2045
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:15,330
which is new,
you wonder at what point does it come in

2046
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:17,530
when they start to go,
what do we need to increase size?

2047
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,660
The gloves are outlaw.
Some of the various actually is um,

2048
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:25,661
less safe.
That's where the bigger gloves is 

2049
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:25,661
because they hit harder with know the 
beer gloves.

2050
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:30,621
There's two issues with it.
One is that you don't break your hands 

2051
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:33,171
as much,
so you could pretty much punch a guy 

2052
01:29:33,171 --> 01:29:33,171
anywhere.
I'm not always,

2053
01:29:33,171 --> 01:29:37,701
some guys have fragile hands,
even with the big gloves like floyd 

2054
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:37,701
mayweather,
he's uh,

2055
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:39,060
he's had several operations on his hands
because he kept,

2056
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,350
kept breaking them,
whereas I'm,

2057
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:46,360
the mma gloves are smaller and you can't
take as many shots with them.

2058
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:51,470
The bigger gloves you can take more 
punches and in fact it's not really 

2059
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:53,790
necessarily the concussive blows that do
a lot of brain damage.

2060
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,050
It's the just the constant subconcussive
trauma that is the,

2061
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,970
it's the real issue.
So,

2062
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:04,980
um,
there's a guy named nick denise who was 

2063
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,981
a mma fighter who just retired,
I believe he was a premed student I 

2064
01:30:06,981 --> 01:30:07,200
think,
but very,

2065
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:08,580
very smart guy.
Nonetheless,

2066
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:13,500
whatever his educational background was.
But that was his concern was the sub sub

2067
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:14,960
concussive trauma,
you know,

2068
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:19,970
you start thinking like,
why can't I remember where I put my 

2069
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:19,970
fucking car keys?
Like,

2070
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,930
is that normal absentmindedness or am I 
missing a year now?

2071
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,380
And that's a,
that's a,

2072
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:26,070
it's a real concern.
Still safer than boxing.

2073
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:27,810
I mean by far,
right east,

2074
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:29,550
supposedly.
Yes,

2075
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,430
because boxing has less options.
Um,

2076
01:30:32,490 --> 01:30:33,480
for,
for one,

2077
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:36,090
you don't,
you can't clench in a boxing match.

2078
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:41,090
You're not supposed to.
You can't take out of the ground if 

2079
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:41,090
you're stuck in a situation.
You,

2080
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,640
as far as repetitive head trauma goes 
though it depends how your training your

2081
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:49,670
training is what's really important 
because a lot of boxers who are very 

2082
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,341
smart,
they don't train that hard or as far as 

2083
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:52,341
a sparring,
they don't spar hard.

2084
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:53,460
They spar,
like they'll,

2085
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:56,880
they'll get good sparring partners in 
the box.

2086
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:59,880
It like a 50 60 percent ratio,
you know,

2087
01:30:59,881 --> 01:31:01,980
they don't,
they don't try to murder each other.

2088
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:07,160
Whereas there's a lot of mma gyms where 
guys are trying to merge of it and that 

2089
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,880
not sit.
It doesn't take place with boxing 

2090
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:10,880
because there's some camps where it 
certainly does,

2091
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,661
but for the most part if you're watching
a high end boxing camp where there's a 

2092
01:31:14,661 --> 01:31:16,650
lot of money on the line,
they're having good,

2093
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:18,590
hard sparring,
but they're,

2094
01:31:18,591 --> 01:31:20,880
they're also working,
they're working on,

2095
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:25,881
you know,
a guy imitating a certain style or you 

2096
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:29,491
know,
putting a certain amount of pressure on 

2097
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:29,491
a fighter or whatever you know,
in,

2098
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:29,491
in the high end camp.

2099
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:30,130
If you're dealing with floyd mayweather,
camp,

2100
01:31:30,131 --> 01:31:32,430
camper,
somewhere along anywhere in that range.

2101
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:35,040
You're dealing with it.
They have a strategy to it.

2102
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,610
In mma you have a bunch of gems like 
that,

2103
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:42,390
but then you also have a massive amount 
of gyms where people just sort of making

2104
01:31:42,391 --> 01:31:44,790
it up as they go along and they think 
the harder you go,

2105
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,590
the better it is.
So let's go hard.

2106
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:51,591
We're bad asses.
We're going hard every day and they'll 

2107
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:51,591
go hard.
Even to the head.

2108
01:31:51,591 --> 01:31:56,060
Like we had boss route nine yesterday 
and he was talking about a holland 

2109
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:56,060
style,
a sparring.

2110
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,870
They would go full blast the body into 
the legs,

2111
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,340
but to the head they would punches 
because they realize,

2112
01:32:00,341 --> 01:32:05,341
you know,
you're damaging each other in a lot of 

2113
01:32:05,341 --> 01:32:07,300
the less experience mma gyms or the less
well-structured mma gyms.

2114
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,010
They don't realize that.
And so they,

2115
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:14,310
they're punching each other full blast 
in the face and training and they're 

2116
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,310
fucking each other up.

2117
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:14,310
Wow.
Yeah.

2118
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:16,450
And then that up it adds up.
There's no way.

2119
01:32:16,451 --> 01:32:21,451
It doesn't add up.
Like you'll get a guy like alistair 

2120
01:32:21,451 --> 01:32:24,601
overeem,
he's been stopped something like nine 

2121
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:24,601
times,
maybe even 10.

2122
01:32:24,601 --> 01:32:26,290
I think this might be the 10th time has 
been stopped.

2123
01:32:26,570 --> 01:32:28,000
And his career,
that bigfoot fight,

2124
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:33,510
that's a lot of times man.
It's a lot of times of the fight being 

2125
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:36,820
stopped from you getting punched too 
many times where you're just guns,

2126
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:40,750
you know,
that's not supposed to get nine of those

2127
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:41,730
in your life.
Right.

2128
01:32:41,731 --> 01:32:46,690
I don't think in it's supposed to get 
one actually has an awful lot.

2129
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,820
Yeah.
And you watch and you watch it.

2130
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:53,821
In fact,
after a few of those you watch it start 

2131
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:53,821
to affect their ability to fight.
They're not,

2132
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:53,821
they're not the same guy out there.
Oh,

2133
01:32:53,821 --> 01:32:58,490
it certainly does.
And especially if they're not involved 

2134
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:02,710
in any testosterone replacement therapy 
because one of the things about,

2135
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:03,700
uh,
the,

2136
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,680
uh,
all that trauma is,

2137
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:10,710
there's been a lot of studies that show 
that it starts to shut down your 

2138
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,000
testosterone,
like multiple concussions than it.

2139
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,210
Uh,
it shuts down.

2140
01:33:13,211 --> 01:33:18,211
It does,
it does A lot of damage to your 

2141
01:33:18,211 --> 01:33:19,801
pituitary that apparently the pituitary 
is quite sensitive to concussive blows 

2142
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:25,620
and when you get blasted a bunch of 
times they've shown that it starts to 

2143
01:33:25,620 --> 01:33:26,230
lower your testosterone and start to 
make us depressed.

2144
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:31,980
You know,
one of the things that makes you 

2145
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:31,980
depressed,
you know,

2146
01:33:31,980 --> 01:33:33,460
but it's a scary thing,
especially for a guy like you,

2147
01:33:33,461 --> 01:33:36,040
I'm sure who's you make your living with
your mind.

2148
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:36,750
Well,
I,

2149
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,760
I'm,
I'm just going to get back into some 

2150
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,590
like mna bootcamp and stuff and they did
a little crop of guys.

2151
01:33:42,591 --> 01:33:46,720
San francisco had an mma course and I 
was having a ball doing that,

2152
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:49,090
but I was not not going to get hit in 
the head.

2153
01:33:49,210 --> 01:33:49,630
Like,
that's,

2154
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,670
that's my,
this is my business.

2155
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:54,790
And then when they actually did spar,
I got hit about three times.

2156
01:33:54,790 --> 01:33:56,830
I never saw punch him.
Like I don't process that.

2157
01:33:57,910 --> 01:33:59,530
Whenever you just did,
I didn't see anything.

2158
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:01,120
Let's go back to grappling.
Grappling.

2159
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:03,880
I can do all god damn day long,
but I don't see punches.

2160
01:34:03,881 --> 01:34:04,780
So I'm out.
Yeah.

2161
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,710
Well the key is you got to do only with 
people who you really totally trust.

2162
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:12,520
You got to do it.
It's hard if you do it with strangers or

2163
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:16,120
if you do it with a guy who's got a chip
on the shoulder,

2164
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:21,270
some,
some guys just tagged them lightly and 

2165
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:21,700
all of a sudden you're in a war that can
happen.

2166
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:22,720
And you know,
what do you do?

2167
01:34:22,721 --> 01:34:26,770
The istop sparring partner and stuff.
Most of the time guys don't,

2168
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,590
most time they just engaged in the war 
with the spark writer.

2169
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,940
You don't stop them and say,
hey,

2170
01:34:30,941 --> 01:34:35,941
what are we doing here?
We're not because you don't trust him 

2171
01:34:35,941 --> 01:34:35,941
now because now he's swinging at your 
full blast.

2172
01:34:35,941 --> 01:34:37,290
It happens all the time.
You know,

2173
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:39,850
that was um,
that's,

2174
01:34:39,851 --> 01:34:44,851
I think that was one of the biggest 
problems in mma in the early days of,

2175
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,880
you know,
mixed martial arts camps with guys 

2176
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,461
getting beat up too much in the gym 
before they ever even gotten to the 

2177
01:34:53,461 --> 01:34:53,510
cage.
Right.

2178
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,370
But I,
yeah,

2179
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:56,460
I don't know.
It makes you wonder what is that?

2180
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:57,980
And that's one of those things that I 
get into.

2181
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
Bell outnet,
that galactic football league series I 

2182
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:05,300
told you about his size,
speed and strength continue to increase.

2183
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,540
Now we're seeing things in the nfl where
it's just,

2184
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:13,590
it's basic physics and you can put all 
the patting you on around a guy unless 

2185
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:14,900
they do something drastic to improve 
that helmet.

2186
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:18,590
When you get more,
the more force that is on bigger,

2187
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:23,591
faster,
stronger bodies are going to produce 

2188
01:35:23,591 --> 01:35:25,181
more force.
That brain bounces around inside the 

2189
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:27,311
head and when you project football 
players out to the four and 500 pound 

2190
01:35:27,311 --> 01:35:27,920
size and fighters up to the 400 pound 
size,

2191
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:31,520
it's something you try and try and get 
into that.

2192
01:35:31,521 --> 01:35:36,521
In the fiction itself too is like what?
What is the average career like when 

2193
01:35:36,521 --> 01:35:39,881
you're getting hit on a regular basis by
something that can bench press 1500 

2194
01:35:39,881 --> 01:35:43,661
pounds and can run 30 miles an hour.
Careers like through three seasons tops 

2195
01:35:43,661 --> 01:35:44,330
and then you're just the vegetable.

2196
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:49,360
There's nothing you can unless you get 
in the head and create some kind of 

2197
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:49,610
additional structure between the brain 
and the skull.

2198
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:54,611
There's only so much that they can do 
other than change the rules to stop so 

2199
01:35:54,611 --> 01:35:54,710
much damage.
Did you,

2200
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:59,720
uh,
in yOur fiction ever create some other 

2201
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,320
sort of protective wear that people 
would wear?

2202
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:05,321
Or did you issue it altoGether?
Which is what a lot of people think 

2203
01:36:05,321 --> 01:36:08,420
would be the solution to stop a lot of 
the head butting each other and smashing

2204
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:12,020
heads will be given to the helmets that 
the first time I heard that I'm like,

2205
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:13,940
that's the dumbest thing I ever heard 
of.

2206
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,980
And then then I started to think about 
it a little bit.

2207
01:36:15,981 --> 01:36:16,640
And like,
you know,

2208
01:36:16,641 --> 01:36:20,690
rugby does not have the same.
It's not the same kind of contact rugby.

2209
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:23,600
You do not get a 15 yard headstart and 
take someone out of the picture,

2210
01:36:23,990 --> 01:36:25,180
but um,
you know,

2211
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,880
a very rough and very physical and yet 
they don't take to impact.

2212
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:30,260
I do.
And football players do.

2213
01:36:30,261 --> 01:36:32,330
I do some,
some of the magic hand waving with that.

2214
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:32,690
I'm like,
well,

2215
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:37,691
this new helmet technology protects 
against this much and then you just 

2216
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:37,691
don't.
You don't explain it because if we could

2217
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:38,270
explain it,
we'd be doing it right now.

2218
01:36:38,271 --> 01:36:41,630
So there it is taken into account,
but the main character,

2219
01:36:41,631 --> 01:36:43,520
quentin barnes,
it's the seven book series.

2220
01:36:43,521 --> 01:36:48,521
We've got four books done and by book 
five he's already starting to feel the 

2221
01:36:48,521 --> 01:36:48,530
effects of,
you know,

2222
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:53,531
I stand in the pocket and if I do my job
right sometimes in getting rid of the 

2223
01:36:53,531 --> 01:36:57,341
ball and standing there when something 
that weighs 800 pounds is hitting me as 

2224
01:36:57,341 --> 01:37:01,631
hard as it can.
That's what you get paid to do and it's 

2225
01:37:01,631 --> 01:37:02,570
going to start impacting him.
So I'm excited about that.

2226
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,760
The last three books start to get into 
the character analysis.

2227
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:06,390
what happens when a,
when a,

2228
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:09,950
the ultimate professional athlete,
the top of his game,

2229
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:12,920
things don't,
aren't processing as fast anymore and he

2230
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:17,921
can't make the decisions as quick as he 
could in his reads aren't quite as good 

2231
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:17,921
as they were before and his body's 
starting to hurt.

2232
01:37:17,921 --> 01:37:22,690
So follow them all the way from a 19 
year old rookie through this league to 

2233
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:23,170
the point where he's like,
at some point he's going to have to make

2234
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:25,700
a decision,
do I continue to play and do what I love

2235
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:30,730
and die doing what I love,
which is admirable and going to die 

2236
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:30,730
anyway.
So whY not?

2237
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:31,490
Or do you look to the future and be 
like,

2238
01:37:31,491 --> 01:37:33,350
what are the next 40 years of my life 
gonna be like.

2239
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:38,440
So it's gonna be,
it's a huge influence in the book as to 

2240
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:41,441
what's going to happen when you just 
stop and think about what an actual 

2241
01:37:41,441 --> 01:37:44,651
football player today a 310 pound man 
who can run like,

2242
01:37:45,770 --> 01:37:48,830
like literally like a track star of the 
19 thirties.

2243
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:54,160
You know,
when you stop and think about the kind 

2244
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,991
of damage they can do and you sort of 
look towards the future and a thousand 

2245
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:58,560
years from now,
2000 years from now,

2246
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,170
when this drastic changes happening just
the last 50,

2247
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,940
60 years,
it's unbelievable.

2248
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:07,980
You look at where the guys are a third 
larger than they used to be in just 50 

2249
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,420
years.
So you extrapolate that out.

2250
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:14,470
Uh,
and of course there's genetic and 

2251
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:14,470
physical limitations,
but as jeanette,

2252
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:18,890
as,
as nutrition improves and science 

2253
01:38:18,890 --> 01:38:20,631
improves and genetic engineering proves 
you're going to wind up in the future 

2254
01:38:20,631 --> 01:38:21,240
pro sports a couple centuries now,
pro sport,

2255
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:21,820
you're not,
I mean,

2256
01:38:21,821 --> 01:38:26,821
they're not even going to look human.
They're gonna look like a different 

2257
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:28,401
species.
That's how I came up with the idea for 

2258
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:29,841
the book is um,
I used to be able to do a little stuff 

2259
01:38:29,841 --> 01:38:33,081
for espn when I was in college,
like manage the teams coming off the 

2260
01:38:33,081 --> 01:38:33,540
field or hold a dish and that kind of a 
thing.

2261
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:38,870
And I has 126 pounds and Michigan,
Michigan state's a giant football game 

2262
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:39,630
every year.
It's huge.

2263
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:45,060
Espn is there.
And my producer out and I'm on the 

2264
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:47,631
headset with him and he's gotten me 
bringing the teams out of the out of 

2265
01:38:47,631 --> 01:38:48,570
their dressing room and then he starts 
screwing with me because I'm 19,

2266
01:38:48,571 --> 01:38:49,940
I don't know any better and he's in my 
ears.

2267
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:54,950
You wanT to listen.
If they don't come out at the right 

2268
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,950
time,
espn is going to lose $5,

2269
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:55,530
million dollars of advertising and 
that's going to be on you.

2270
01:38:55,830 --> 01:39:00,830
And I'm like,
he was fucking with me because he could 

2271
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:00,830
because I didn't know any better and I'm
like so stressed out.

2272
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:05,780
And then let Michigan state out of the 
locker room at the point time and all 

2273
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:08,370
these giant human beings are coming out.
And then as they're coming out,

2274
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:13,910
they're running,
walking by the door to the Michigan 

2275
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,910
locker room,
Michigan.

2276
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:14,950
The door lock room door opens up and 
standing in the doors.

2277
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:15,720
Greg,
scrap neck.

2278
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:16,680
You ever heard of hIm?
No.

2279
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:17,550
He was six,
eight,

2280
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:19,220
three,
three 60.

2281
01:39:19,250 --> 01:39:20,370
It was.
He was an.

2282
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,990
It was a giant,
giant man.

2283
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,070
Plus he's got all the gear on and I'm on
and I'm like.

2284
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:26,610
And I'm,
I'm a little tinY thing,

2285
01:39:26,611 --> 01:39:27,330
I'm freaking out.
I'm like,

2286
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,620
oh hell,
Michigan is going to come out.

2287
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:33,770
And he's like,
you don't let them come out of that 

2288
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:33,770
locker room.
I don't care what you have to do.

2289
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:37,410
And so I remember he's a giant.
He's sIx foot eight.

2290
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:39,690
I'm five [inaudible] eight.
I'm 125 pounds and uh,

2291
01:39:39,691 --> 01:39:43,200
and he goes to step out and I just put 
my hand right right on the sternum.

2292
01:39:43,201 --> 01:39:46,020
I just stiff arm them and what?
Stop right there.

2293
01:39:46,021 --> 01:39:47,940
you guys can't come out of that locked 
room yet.

2294
01:39:48,220 --> 01:39:52,560
And just,
he looked confused like,

2295
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,630
who is this little person?

2296
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,110
And he managed to wait and all the guys 
were behind him and he managed wait just

2297
01:39:58,111 --> 01:39:59,410
long enough for Michigan state to come 
out.

2298
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:00,900
And then I got out of the way and they 
came out.

2299
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:06,200
but I had,
I wrote the whole concept of the book 

2300
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:08,561
and that one moment,
the whole gfl series I had my hand on 

2301
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:11,301
this guy's here.
My nose came up to his sternum and I 

2302
01:40:11,301 --> 01:40:11,301
remember thinking,
man,

2303
01:40:11,301 --> 01:40:11,850
it's like he's a completely different 
species than me.

2304
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:14,940
And that was an after that I went home 
and started writing that book.

2305
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:17,130
Like what if we have different species 
playing football?

2306
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:19,410
And the whole thing blew up from there.
Wow,

2307
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:20,850
that's awesome.
Yeah,

2308
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:25,851
I'm lucky I'm alive.
They really are like completely 

2309
01:40:25,851 --> 01:40:26,390
different species if you're dealing with
those super athletes,

2310
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:28,410
football players.
I mean we're,

2311
01:40:28,411 --> 01:40:30,600
we're,
we're getting some really enormous,

2312
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,000
enormous human beings now in the 
combine.

2313
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,460
I read,
I may have read this incorrectly.

2314
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,660
They had three guys,
three offensive lineman,

2315
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,470
300,
10 pounds who ran for six forties.

2316
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:45,500
If I stand still and they run at me and 
hit me like that,

2317
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,510
dead on impact.
That's how much force is involved.

2318
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:49,980
I'm just dead.
There's nothing you can do.

2319
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:52,080
It's crazy.
I wonder how many of these,

2320
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:57,081
uh,
up and coming players are more aware of 

2321
01:40:57,081 --> 01:40:57,610
the risks now because of the past few 
years,

2322
01:40:57,611 --> 01:41:00,310
all the different stories that have been
coming out about players,

2323
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:01,810
depression,
post,

2324
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:05,980
post career suicide,
veterans probably are.

2325
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:10,981
But you know,
when you are 22 years old and someone's 

2326
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:11,050
paying you hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to play football and that's been

2327
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:13,660
your dream your whole life,
you're still 22 in your bulletproof.

2328
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:17,620
I think that the rules have to come in 
to adjust behavior.

2329
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:19,780
It has to be run from the top down 
because these,

2330
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:20,680
these,
you know,

2331
01:41:20,681 --> 01:41:23,470
you were 22 and then if I was playing in
the nfl,

2332
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:24,550
there's nobody can tell me anything.

2333
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,040
I'm going to go hit that motherfucker 
hard as I possibly can.

2334
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,770
That's how I make my.
That's how I make my money.

2335
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:32,230
That's how people know me because I'm 
the guy who brings the heat.

2336
01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:37,770
It's not,
it's never gonna stop from the players 

2337
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:37,770
themselves.
And you start to think,

2338
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:37,870
what if I get hurt?
I'll get out,

2339
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:40,780
but I won't get hurt too bad.
I'll be smart.

2340
01:41:40,930 --> 01:41:42,130
They also,
you know,

2341
01:41:42,131 --> 01:41:47,131
try and remember back to that age,
there is this rationalization of maybe 

2342
01:41:47,131 --> 01:41:47,380
I'll get hurt and won't be quite as 
smart.

2343
01:41:47,381 --> 01:41:51,460
I'm willing to pay that price in order 
to have this moment right now.

2344
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:54,550
I'm willing to give up years down the 
road and at 22,

2345
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:55,240
23,
24,

2346
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:57,610
that is a perfectly rational,
logical decision.

2347
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:58,420
You're like,
this,

2348
01:41:58,421 --> 01:42:01,150
this makes sense to me.
It's not until you get 20 years down the

2349
01:42:01,151 --> 01:42:01,450
road.
I'm like,

2350
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:06,480
boy,
I'm glad I didn't get any brain damage 

2351
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:06,480
that would suck right now.

2352
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,410
It's also a thing when you're 22 and you
love playing football.

2353
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:09,370
Yeah.
That's another thing.

2354
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:12,220
It's so very fucking exciting thing to 
do as a,

2355
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:14,470
as his mma finding as is a,
you know,

2356
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:16,690
a lot of murder,
certain motocross riding.

2357
01:42:16,691 --> 01:42:21,691
There's a lot of crazy dangerous things 
that people really enjoy doing and 

2358
01:42:21,691 --> 01:42:25,681
ultimately that's really our choice.
Should we should have that across the 

2359
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:27,160
board.
We're hard wired to go out and seek that

2360
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:28,990
kind of danger.
Evolutionarily speaking.

2361
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:32,080
We're hardwired to go out like we have 
to go get into life and death situations

2362
01:42:32,081 --> 01:42:33,250
to hunt,
to defend,

2363
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:38,640
to fight off other tribes.
And the people who have those instincts 

2364
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:39,940
are the people who wound up living in 
reproducing and passing that on.

2365
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:41,260
So as a,
you know,

2366
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:44,830
18 to 27 year old male,
you are hard wired for war.

2367
01:42:44,860 --> 01:42:46,390
That is what in a lot of guys aren't.

2368
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:48,850
That's cool.
But a lot of guys have that.

2369
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:53,910
That's what they inherited is like let's
go out and kill some shit and that's in 

2370
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:54,430
you.
I had that in me.

2371
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:55,810
I wasn't very good at because I was so 
small.

2372
01:42:55,811 --> 01:42:57,720
Wrestling was a good outlet,
but you know,

2373
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:02,730
you know what that feeling is like and,
and these kinds of activities provide a 

2374
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:04,150
safe,
rational outlet for those things.

2375
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:06,160
But it's in there and it's going to come
out one way or another.

2376
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:07,840
Yeah.
For a lot of men.

2377
01:43:07,841 --> 01:43:09,070
So mean.
And then again,

2378
01:43:09,071 --> 01:43:14,071
like as you said,
some don't have it in them for a lot of 

2379
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:14,071
men.
Yeah,

2380
01:43:14,071 --> 01:43:18,020
that's a real issue because it's sort of
just you have a whole reward system set 

2381
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:22,051
up and your dna that you have no control
over and you have all these things that 

2382
01:43:22,051 --> 01:43:26,041
you enjoy and you know,
there's very little outlet for it when 

2383
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:26,170
you're working in a cubicle and it's 
hard.

2384
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:30,580
It's hard to make your body a free of 
the influence of all these interesting.

2385
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:32,260
There's things that can't be 
rationalized.

2386
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,550
There's just things you cAnnot explain 
away.

2387
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:39,570
Like when I,
when I used to wrestle and finally got 

2388
01:43:39,570 --> 01:43:40,930
to compete against people my own size 
because I played football too and played

2389
01:43:40,931 --> 01:43:42,280
as hard as I could and did everything he
could.

2390
01:43:42,281 --> 01:43:43,720
But I got my ass kicked away a hundred 
20,

2391
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:44,620
100,
25 pounds.

2392
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,560
When I wrestled going up against guys my
own weight,

2393
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:49,330
I was able to,
you know,

2394
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:54,760
dominate people and just things like a 
cross face or it's a,

2395
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,170
you know,
it's kind of mean to say.

2396
01:43:56,171 --> 01:44:01,171
I guess one of the greatest feelings of 
my whole life is I suplex the kid and 

2397
01:44:01,171 --> 01:44:02,590
broke his collarbone and when I,
when I brought him up,

2398
01:44:02,591 --> 01:44:04,330
put him back,
he ran his collarbone and broken.

2399
01:44:04,331 --> 01:44:07,720
He just stuck there and it was utterly 
primitive.

2400
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:08,730
It was just,
you know,

2401
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:11,020
why would you be happy?
You just heard another human being.

2402
01:44:11,050 --> 01:44:12,280
He was a good guy.
I knew him.

2403
01:44:12,281 --> 01:44:17,281
He's a nice guys,
but when I that that for that brief 

2404
01:44:17,281 --> 01:44:17,281
moment,
all the,

2405
01:44:17,281 --> 01:44:18,790
all the chemistry inside and everything 
else is like,

2406
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,560
ah,
that's how you do it.

2407
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:21,100
Does that help

2408
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:23,720
pew and you're writing when you're 
writing something like ancestor,

2409
01:44:23,721 --> 01:44:24,500
when you're writing about

2410
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:27,910
this crazy gigantic pack predator.
I get into it.

2411
01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:31,030
I get into it a ton,
especially in the new book pandemic.

2412
01:44:31,031 --> 01:44:35,740
The thought process is we are a modified
by society.

2413
01:44:36,010 --> 01:44:38,650
We have a set of rules that we live by a
certain comradery,

2414
01:44:38,651 --> 01:44:40,840
helping out our fellow man,
helping our fellow women,

2415
01:44:41,170 --> 01:44:42,160
um,
you know,

2416
01:44:42,161 --> 01:44:42,620
and,
and,

2417
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:46,120
and are growing culture,
the growing equality of women.

2418
01:44:46,121 --> 01:44:48,790
And there's no need to be a douche bag 
law by and large.

2419
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:52,210
You don't need to Be a douche bag to and
get along just fine being a good guy and

2420
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:57,300
then take these people who are aspiring 
to become these better people who are 

2421
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,470
genuinely good people and then put them 
in the pressure cooker.

2422
01:44:59,770 --> 01:45:03,090
When you start to get into it and it's 
like you and me,

2423
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:04,240
joe,
are both in this room,

2424
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:09,270
but if I get out that door,
I'm going to live and you're going to 

2425
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:09,270
die and if we both here,
stay here together,

2426
01:45:09,270 --> 01:45:11,470
we might both die and there's a tiny 
chance in my.

2427
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:16,150
That's what I play with a lot is what 
what does a person do when their life is

2428
01:45:16,151 --> 01:45:21,151
actually on the line and there comes a 
situation they have absolutely no 

2429
01:45:21,151 --> 01:45:22,450
control over.
Do we regress to that lizard brain?

2430
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:27,480
Do we start looking out for number one 
and I don't get into it too much like I 

2431
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,360
don't.
You protect your kids,

2432
01:45:28,361 --> 01:45:29,860
you protect your family.
There's a guy,

2433
01:45:29,861 --> 01:45:31,470
you've known him for 20 years,
you two are gonna,

2434
01:45:31,471 --> 01:45:36,471
you know you're going down together,
but it's largely when the strangers are 

2435
01:45:36,471 --> 01:45:38,080
brought together,
get a small amount of time to gel to get

2436
01:45:38,081 --> 01:45:40,270
to know each other so it's not 
completely alien.

2437
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:41,330
It's itself,
it's,

2438
01:45:41,331 --> 01:45:46,331
it's one of my group.
Then bring in the 650 pound pack 

2439
01:45:46,331 --> 01:45:46,390
predators.
What happens?

2440
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:47,740
What do these characters do?

2441
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,920
That sounds awesome,
man.

2442
01:45:48,921 --> 01:45:50,430
I'm going to read this.
I can't wait to read it.

2443
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:54,170
Sounds like a great idea.
I love your whole philosophy of love,

2444
01:45:54,171 --> 01:45:59,171
what you did.
I love the way you became sort of self 

2445
01:45:59,171 --> 01:46:02,171
actualized by going out and putting it 
online yourself and reading your own 

2446
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:05,510
books and putting it out in an audio 
book form and making it free.

2447
01:46:05,511 --> 01:46:07,220
I think it's brilliant.
It's beautiful.

2448
01:46:07,221 --> 01:46:12,221
I love the fact that it worked.
I love your whole philosophy on giving 

2449
01:46:12,221 --> 01:46:13,610
it to people that can't afford it and 
you just put a little ad in there.

2450
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:14,660
It's great.
It's beautiful.

2451
01:46:14,661 --> 01:46:15,740
It's all perfect.
Great.

2452
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,510
Thank you very much for coming on and I 
really,

2453

2456
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:24,900
Thank you.

2457
