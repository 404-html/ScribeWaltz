1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,503
Okay.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,863
Okay.

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,840
[inaudible] [inaudible]

4
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,170
boom, Sherlock luck. Boom bitches,
boom. Shakalaka like a Boob,

5
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,070
some left in the volcano.

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,190
That was real. That was real. That
was powerful. And it was real shit.

7
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,640
We got Sam Aaa on this, this volcano
as well. It's good to be here.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,110
Sam Shipley tried to come to the fucking
Joe Rogan experience podcast talking

9
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,330
some crazy shit about,

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,690
he's been partying too much lately and
he wants to try this one sober. Yeah.

11
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,370
I wanted to like Sam [inaudible] dare you.

12
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,760
How dare you brother. We're old
school road dogging. Last respect to,

13
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,860
don't you know what you're saying?

14
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,800
You're trying to get things going and
trying to be all discipline and positive.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,900
I feel your homie.
I'm trying Lee's jump.

16
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,020
We were sponsored by the flashlight
this weekend, every week.

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,540
And if you go to Joe rogan.net
and click on the link, you will,

18
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:32,541
you will save 15% type in the keyword
Rogan and you can get a discount.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,720
Sam tripling your announcer voices
getting good. Perfect. So yeah,

20
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,860
you're really getting it
down and working on it now.

21
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:42,330
All you to do is start doing that quick
small talk like in the fine print and

22
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:42,721
you're going to be,

23
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:46,770
you know what I've been thinking about
doing is taking like just for purely for

24
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,400
educational purposes,
like a weekend Dj Strip club Gig,

25
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,480
just so I could work on my announcer voice
because I feel like if this ever does

26
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,160
blossom into a real radio show,

27
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:59,070
which it totally can because radio
is definitely on the comeback.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,880
I mean that's what I want to hear
after I hear uncensored podcast.

29
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:03,361
I want to hear it.

30
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:06,990
A little short sound where they
can't say anything and they get,

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,290
you can't say retard or can
even say butthole, right?

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,310
I think there's three tonging can't
say retard. Dude. When I was in Boston,

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,610
we did a video that if you could watch
the video that we did and the most recent

34
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,820
one from Austin, Texas, we had,

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,660
we had to say we had to do it
over and over and over again.

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,710
Was it fucking terrible? They had a beep,
retard the Beep, retard like 20 times.

37
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:29,870
Hold on. Where did they do that in Austin
when you did your podcast there? Bb? No,

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,810
no, no, no, no, no. We did the radio show
there. That's crazy. Yeah, it's terrible.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,980
But that's what's happening man.

40
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,010
And what's crazy about it is before
we even got into the radio station,

41
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,350
the person that drove us around
that worked for the comedy club,

42
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,850
she was talking about how that,

43
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,940
oh you just said the r word
like like it's a bad word.

44
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,920
We're like kind of thinking
like, yeah, exactly what?

45
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,090
And then we go into the radio station
and Joe was saying on the radio and got

46
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:55,850
caught out called out for saying retard
on the radio and it was just like, yeah,

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,250
there were totally serious. I'm trying,
I'm doing on it. It's just like nobody

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,730
calls people with special
needs retarded anymore. They,

49
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:06,100
they did this special need. You
call us assholes retarded. Exactly.

50
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,700
That dude's retarded asshole.
Yeah. They have down syndrome.

51
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,550
They have an actual name for the disease,
like calling someone a retard.

52
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,830
It's like you can't say idiot.
Well guess what?

53
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,430
That's what retards used to be when
you got, when you had down syndrome,

54
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,650
they used to call you a mongoloid idiot.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,430
That was the actual medical definition
for what the fuck is wrong with you.

56
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,030
It's so much worse. Isn't that crazy?
They used to your baby's an idiot. Here,

57
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,140
take your baby home on the fucking
idiot. Well, you can say idiot,

58
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:36,430
but saying you can't say retard. Retard
is not some sort of a scientific thing.

59
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,210
It's not like you're, you're,
you're, you're 100% yeah.
It doesn't make any sense.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,850
You can't say retarded. I
can say retard. You fucks.

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,750
It's like every year we go back
further and further what we calve.

62
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,640
I've cut faggot out of my vernacular.

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,700
The only time I say faggot now is when
I talk about the word faggot like right

64
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,340
now. And it feels good. You let it
go. Good to go back to my old friend,

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,120
like, let me just say about
the word faggot. I have,

66
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,200
I have more respect personally for the
gay community about that word than I do

67
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,290
for the black community and the word
nigger. Really. And I'll tell you why.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,590
Because they call themselves
[inaudible] out on saying faggot too.

69
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,370
So at least there, there's not this weird
double standard, but they know though,

70
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:18,010
like Perez Hilton, that was how
he got in big trouble. Right.

71
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,650
He got in big trouble. Yeah, that's true.
You I knew. I see what you're saying.

72
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,180
You know what I'm saying? They're
gay. People will get this and saying,

73
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,890
oh there's this. Okay. We can say
we're taking it back. The only time,

74
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,790
and I was talking to on my podcast is
that the only time I think it's okay to

75
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,570
say the n word is in bed.
Like I love getting it all I do.

76
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:37,840
I love getting called the n word. I don't
know why you've already said nigger.

77
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,900
All right. After you say, I love it.
This was Bain, this Mexican chicken,

78
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:45,160
the back of my car. She was calling
you a nigger. Yeah, it was so,

79
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,200
it was so hot and I'm just like,
yeah, they just like, you know,

80
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,690
I got to get that place where I know
the girls cool. And then I'll be like,

81
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,730
can you call me that? They're like,
why did they call it? And they're like,

82
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,330
they just turn you asked you, we'll
call you. She started calling me.

83
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,910
She started calling you
later on with other chicks.

84
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,030
I know once I know of in
this cool place with them,

85
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,740
have them drop some n bombs on me.
Okay, so for the one check one check,

86
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,650
you just kind of got into it.
She just called me and but it,

87
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,760
then it became your thing. Yeah. Wow.
But that's how all fetish is start.

88
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,670
Like something happens accidentally
and you're like, hey, I like that.

89
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,270
You know what I'm saying? That's how
all weird shit start crazy one though.

90
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,050
Like you're banging this chick. And what,
what was the first reaction? I was like,

91
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,360
so tell me what to tell me how it
went down. I'm like, what? You know,

92
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,850
it's kind of like here in the
backseat of a car. Well, first of all,

93
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,760
rocking it old school. I appreciate
you still get low. How long this week?

94
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,610
Years and years and years ago. Years
and years and years ago. I just love,

95
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,750
first of all, I love car
sex. I just love this dirty,

96
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,940
like I'm looking for a car right
now and I'm literally thinking,

97
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,370
can I Bang a chick in
the back of this car?

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,640
Like that is one of the things I think
about when I'm thinking about purchasing

99
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:56,110
a car. Can Bang a chick in the backseat
of a Porsche, do it, can't do let Alexa.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,710
So Econet should be their selling point.
Like that whole, uh, so practical. Yeah.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,730
Hey, we're Cadillac. You can bang
in the back of your car. Yeah,

102
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,810
that you should do that.
Like how a thing where they go.

103
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,930
What are you saying back there?
Why not? That's the commercial

104
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,280
windows. Tinted windows in
the back. So always nice dude.

105
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,830
You've got to have tinted windows too.
But then what about the windshield, Bro?

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,990
Your windshield's not tent and people
just get to the front of your car.

107
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,830
Why don't you float with us?

108
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:22,280
The Sun visor thing that you pull out
with us for no one, you know my mom,

109
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,710
this is how crazy it was when
we used to go on vacations.

110
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:27,020
Like what road trips we go on road trips.

111
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,980
You'd put newspapers all around the
windows and would sleep at a rest stop.

112
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,180
And I'm thinking like how crazy.
You wouldn't do that nowadays. Yeah.

113
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,430
That's scary as fuck. Cause they know
there's people in sod. Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:41,210
There's too many crazy, is it that
there's more crazy people now or is it,

115
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,260
we're aware of the crazy people
were aware of the crazy people.

116
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,690
Like some people think
everybody's getting dumber.

117
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,320
I personally think that they're just
getting oversaturated with useless

118
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,610
knowledge.
Do you know what I'm saying?

119
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:57,080
Like there's so much more useless
knowledge out there that's taking up your

120
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:57,914
brain space.

121
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,700
Like when you go home to let's say your
high school reunion and your buddy who

122
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,210
just got married and had kids and went
right to the mill. Right. He's like,

123
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,460
you remember nice going into that.
You're like, no, I don't remember that.

124
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,750
And he's like,
you remember this and be like,

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,730
cause you have all these
new things in your head.

126
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,730
You got to get rid of the old things.
Right. You know what I'm saying?

127
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,480
By Juno you're saying? Yeah.
So it's like, you know,

128
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,970
in the 18 hundreds like some peasant or
something isn't necessarily smarter than

129
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,340
that.
The idiots we have around now,

130
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,760
he just didn't have all this
like Kim Kardashian who's
going to get her pregnant.

131
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:27,590
All this crazy shit in her head.
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,980
That totally makes sense. I mean,
you only have so much room in your,

133
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,340
your hard drive, you know, I don't
know if people are getting dumber.

134
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,790
I think collectively,
uh, there's what it is,

135
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,170
is the people that are smarter are fucking
really smart. Yeah. The really, really,

136
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,700
really smart.
But the people that are dumb,

137
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,540
it's so easy to just get
by and be a moron now.

138
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,220
It's so easy.
You know,

139
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,750
everything is set up for you between
cell phones and easy jobs and it's like,

140
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,190
what do you have to do?

141
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,700
Like all you have to do is just show up
and do what someone tells you and you

142
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,830
don't have to think at all. And then
you get off work. What do you do?

143
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,830
You drink or you go home
and watch reality TV,

144
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:08,300
which makes you even fucking dumber.
It's all and it reinforces like dumb shit.

145
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,060
Like you start thinking there's
nothing wrong with you because hey man,

146
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:13,970
that's how they are on reality TV.
That's driving me crazy.

147
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:17,990
Cause I watched the sneaky
given an interview and she's
acting like she's regal

148
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,730
now. She's sitting there like this
with good posture. Like she, you know,

149
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,490
would you rather like pick her
teeth and play with her pussy? Yeah,

150
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,580
because that's her. That's why we like her
because she's a, you know, a black elk,

151
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,930
Cox Zombie. We let that Shit, you know
what I'm saying? Like we like that.

152
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:35,170
That's what we want.
But you don't act like you're not that Pr.

153
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:39,740
I W you know if you came in right,
you'd be like Joe Rogan, UFC announcer,

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,960
comedian.
That's what you,

155
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,870
you've done like they should introduce
these people as like what they've done.

156
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,830
Like Kim Kardashian and she got peed on
by a third rate wrapper and or video.

157
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,480
That's the intro. Kiana? Yeah.
Really? Yeah. I didn't know that.

158
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:56,180
He talks about man. Yeah, she got heat on.

159
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,950
Whoa, whoa. We, I think is cool. Hold on.

160
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,870
We need to look at the
items that we cannot,

161
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,450
we cannot keep spreading disinformation.
We have in the past,

162
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,090
unfortunately all the bath salts thing,
it's this information or no,

163
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,980
and the other one I said,
this is what I said, no, the
bath salts, it's not fake. No,

164
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,250
no. I guess you're talking about the gun,
the gun shooting the kids. It's fake.

165
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,500
Yeah, that's for sure.
Well, we'll talk about,

166
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:19,860
we'll talk about your struggle with
at first anyway, the bath salts,

167
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,250
there's a drug called bath salts.
Okay.

168
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,820
And what it is is they're selling it as
bath salts so that they can sell it in

169
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:30,390
stores and so that it's unregulated
because what this stuff is,

170
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:31,950
it's like a type of,
you know,

171
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:36,270
at some sort of a cousin to crystal
meth and it's really, really dangerous.

172
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:40,900
They're selling it as legal cocaine in
head shops and they also sell it online

173
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,640
and sell it in some stores and convenience
stores and they're selling it as bath

174
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:49,500
salts. And what it is is an intense,
like really, really bad drug and super,

175
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,560
super predictive. Not just
addictive, but a terrible experience.

176
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,990
Like not even a good time
and you get addicted to it.

177
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,670
It's a bad experience and it's super,

178
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:02,390
isn't it? The original use of it's
supposed to be like for insects or plants,

179
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
fertilizer or something like that.

180
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,210
No,
but they're also selling it.

181
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,100
They're also selling it as a plant food.

182
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,550
All right,
so that that video,

183
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:15,100
I went home and watched it cause when
you were talking about yesterday,

184
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:17,020
I never saw it.
And a of the,

185
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,640
what it was is a video of
these two skateboarder kids
and this guy comes out of

186
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,330
their house and then getting
some kind of confrontation.

187
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,730
The guy goes back and then
the house gets a gun there.

188
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:29,170
The skateboarder guys run away and they
shoot him. Copied on the can. Production?

189
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:33,120
No, I didn't think so because I
live over there. I looked Roma

190
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,700
black. Did you watch a porn? No. Well, I
watched parts of it, but I just was here.

191
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,270
The deal,

192
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,380
apparently the golden shower scene
was cut out of the vivid entertainment

193
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:44,600
release of the second tape.
Allegedly,

194
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,540
Kim was always denied
that ray peed on her.

195
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,390
Although she denied the existence
of the tape for a while too.

196
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,490
So it's in the air. I want to say, you
know the guy who does the sex tapes? Yeah.

197
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,470
I want to say it's real.
Yeah. He said it's real.

198
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,720
We're going to get to the guy who
does the sex tapes in one minute.

199
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:02,720
So you think the good that the key when
we're talking about his two kids are

200
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,250
skateboarding in front
of this guy's house.

201
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,500
There's some sort of an altercation
guy comes out and shoots them.

202
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,910
All right. So the date on
the tape was recently? Yeah,

203
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,800
it was just like last week or something
like that. So first I went through, uh,

204
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,940
put in Google, spent like an hour, hour
and a half looking from news articles,

205
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:22,740
looking for anything. There
was nothing that had in any
news or, right. Especially,

206
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,310
uh, so then you go to the tape and you
started looking at the tape itself.

207
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,460
If you look at the tape,
there's a big flashing record light on it,

208
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,630
which is usually used for,

209
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:33,780
if you're in looking through a view
finder of a camera and not a home security

210
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,860
system, it doesn't record a
flashing record light on it.

211
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,610
So I immediately know good ones
do none that I've ever seen but,

212
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,130
but as a video editor there,
I know that that's fake shit.

213
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,390
That's like what you see on
TV, right? They put on it

214
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,900
again how when you're in a movie and a
guy gets a cell phone and he looks at the

215
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:54,110
text on his phone and you know that's
not the graphics of the phone. Right?

216
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,020
You're like,
this is like some animated bullshit.

217
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,740
It's like so big and stupid looking
like and it takes you out of the movie,

218
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:01,600
right? Like they show
cheaters, they'll do that.

219
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,240
Like here's our undercover
it and then that cross hair.

220
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,190
Oh you can't say crosshairs
anymore either. Yeah.

221
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,150
And then then if you
look at the gun itself,

222
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,700
at first I thought it was like a shotgun.

223
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,740
Cause like how the he shot both of the
kids at the exact same time got hit like

224
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:20,740
meaning one kid did a barrel roll and the
other kid just kind of fell laid down.

225
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,000
It looked like he kind of laid down fell.

226
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,010
So all these things are to me are
like all right something's not right.

227
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,610
So then I started doing more looking
online looking at align found went to live

228
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,820
leak and there was like
12 pages of people.

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,050
Live leak is mostly military based people.

230
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,370
1212 pages of people
saying it's fake and like

231
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,700
is every single one that has like
the really bad videos. Like a Sassy.

232
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,440
Yeah they have like middle mostly
military stuff like planes shooting down

233
00:12:44,441 --> 00:12:46,060
people and like kind of more

234
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,100
like real crazy. You guys are
going deep in my is great. I love,

235
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,230
I told Jim Norton about it but I said
daily motion so I have to email daily

236
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,110
motion might have it too. That's
kind of hear of forge. Chen.

237
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,570
Have you ever heard Chan of course love
four Chan Four Chan is the best skid

238
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,480
marks of the Internet.

239
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,010
No they are not. They are
great. Our stupid Sam trip.

240
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,240
Well what they do is they go after
they go after shit heads like a a not,

241
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,230
they go after a Scientology,

242
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:19,160
they go after the people that were
prosecuting Julian Assange's for the Wiki

243
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:21,340
leaks thing.
You know they go after hypocrites.

244
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
They have a certain amount of morals.

245
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:27,350
I mean yeah there's some psychos
on their stuff. They're definitely

246
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,940
what was leaked that was so bad about us
that we're like oh I can't believe this

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,520
get out. Or you know, it makes me think
we leaked it out. It's like Oh my God,

248
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,660
look at all this stuff. Cause it's all
the, I was watching Msnbc the other day,

249
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:42,760
which is the progressive side,
the argument.

250
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,610
So they'll call out the government
in anything and they're like,

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,540
it didn't really make us look that bad.
If you really take a look at it, sort of,

252
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,050
but it see, it confirmed a lot of things
that people had already suspected.

253
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,200
Like first of all that they
do that the United Nations,

254
00:13:56,201 --> 00:14:00,310
like Hillary Clinton did one thing where
she was trying to collect biometric

255
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,360
data on the United Nations. And this is
like a real email. Well, that's spying.

256
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,640
That's illegal.
That's against international law.

257
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:09,980
You're not allowed to spy on the
fucking members of UN. But they were,

258
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,350
there's some shit like that.

259
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:15,460
But the video of the gunship of the,
um,

260
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,660
the helicopter shooting down those, those
reporters in Iraq, that was the big one.

261
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,020
That was pretty bad. That was really bad.
That it was crazy because then there's,

262
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:25,960
there's kids in the scene too,
and one of the guys says he should,

263
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:28,120
they shouldn't have brought their kids.
You shouldn't have bought their kids.

264
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:33,070
Like that's your reaction to just shooting
50 millimeter rounds onto a car full

265
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,080
of kids. You shouldn't have
brought your kids. It's,

266
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,960
and it shows you what kind of attitude
gets developed when you're in wards wars,

267
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,980
the most unhealthy fucking thing possible.
Man.

268
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,620
There's no way to do it and to
come out of it healthy, you know,

269
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:45,680
there's no way to just,
well,

270
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:48,130
I'll just put that in the past
now and move on with my life. No,

271
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,070
you've been gunning people
down for five fucking,

272
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,780
that shit is to haunt your
memory eventually. It's good.

273
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,210
It's terrible for your fucking, your,
your, your mind and your thinking and,

274
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,260
and you know, people develop
justifications and they
get used to certain things.

275
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:02,690
People can get used to anything and
they get used to killing people.

276
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,280
And that's one of the things
you see in that video.

277
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,630
This callous disregard for life
sucks. It's hard. And you know what,

278
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,000
those guys,
they probably not even bad guys.

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,930
They're just fucking guys who got into
the military and then as time went on,

280
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,070
that's the attitude they have.

281
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,760
And they say a lot of shit like that to
each other to sort of reaffirm, you know,

282
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,130
like, Hey, I should have brought
their kids fucking right. You know,

283
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,340
they'll say shit like, yeah, we're crazy.
We're the craziest, you know, like,

284
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,280
and it's almost like they're saying
these things and you know, like,

285
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,810
let me get them letting gum got down.

286
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,840
It's almost like to reinforce each other
because they all know they're doing

287
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:37,100
something insane. Did you ever hear
the theory, the story that I'm in,

288
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,530
like World War II,
they did us,

289
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,370
the government did a study and they found
that like most soldiers couldn't shoot

290
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:46,940
and kill somebody. It just wasn't
in them. So that's the whole thing.

291
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:51,230
That's when you start seeing in movies
like, uh, more gunplay, more guns,

292
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:54,620
shooting people to kind of get people
used to the idea of actually shooting

293
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:59,450
somebody. Wow. Yeah. I did
some, uh, because back then
it was just so rare. Yeah.

294
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,410
I did some USO tours and one the guy
who took me on was telling me that story

295
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,120
that like in World War One,

296
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:08,240
they found that the majority of soldiers
could not pull the trigger to kill

297
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:13,010
somebody. Wow. So we really have become
desensitized by movies and TV shows.

298
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:17,030
100%. Dude, I, I, uh, was
driving back from Vegas one time.

299
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,150
I saw the most horrific crash
I've ever seen in my life,

300
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,970
and I pulled over to
see if everybody's okay.

301
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,440
There's dead bodies all over the
place. Not even affected, you know,

302
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,720
because I've seen so
much that on television,

303
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,500
I mean this car had fallen on
top of this woman's head. Whoa.

304
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,350
And I was this and the girl was
like his grandma Ken. I'm like,

305
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,160
do not tell her anything. Then he
wanted to see, it was like really,

306
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,250
really weird, but it wasn't.
The weirdest part was my,

307
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,630
I didn't have any reaction to seeing the
dead people. I wasn't like God and I,

308
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,370
that really stuck with me.
Why? I don't know, man. I
would still feel that I didn't,

309
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,090
I didn't. I didn't. I wasn't like, wow,
this is going to still fill it out too.

310
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,810
I don't know, man. It wasn't,
well, I'm not saying I didn't
feel something for them.

311
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,930
Someone's fucking crazy.
No, I didn't say it.

312
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,250
I'm not saying I didn't feel for them,

313
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:09,110
but it wasn't like this incredible
like insane mode. You get a hard on.

314
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,550
Awesome. I started playing
myself, Jill matching.

315
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:16,160
If you know your grandma got
trapped underneath the car
and someone's back there,

316
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,510
is she okay? Yeah, I think
she's going to be all right.

317
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,600
Just stay back and you
go around the corner in,

318
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:24,860
the guy's beating off on your grandma's
dead head. Oh, come on dude, that's crazy.

319
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,390
Somebody out there that would do it.

320
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,990
If you can just think that up like I
just did for sure someone would do it.

321
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:31,790
Could you imagine if grandma
dies in a car accident?

322
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,740
The first guy that pulls over
is beaten off on her head.

323
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,860
Does that the whole Sam Canson story.
Grandma car accident fleshlight right.

324
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,390
That like back in the day they were
partying in a news guy who had a more who

325
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:45,880
like was ran a morgue or something like
that and like the thing was that, yeah,

326
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,300
the homosexual necrophilia picker.

327
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,130
I thought you were talking about his
car accident story. No, that, yeah,

328
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,690
they guys would pay him to come.
Crazy thing, you know, he died.

329
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,570
A drunk driver hit him.
How crazy.

330
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,810
That is crazy to do all this
material about drinking and driving.

331
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,690
He used to do all these things.
We're gonna drag and we're gonna drive.

332
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,690
We're going to pull it off. You know why?
Because we get weighed, every fucking

333
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,430
had that whole bit about it. And it
was, you know, wasn't even funny.

334
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:11,070
It was like cheerleading for losers,
you know,

335
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,340
that was like the dark
years of Kennison comedy.

336
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,250
Like Kennison when he first
came out was the best.

337
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,420
I'd say the Kennison of 1986
who's better than that ever?

338
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:23,640
Who's ever been better than that?
You could love Bill Hicks all you want.

339
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,900
And I do. But Bill Hicks was
never that funny. Just no,
no one was ever that funny.

340
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,640
That fucking homosexual necrophiliac bid
all the shit about Jesus and the cross.

341
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:36,240
And you know, you know why? Because
I was married for two fucking years.

342
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,100
All that was the best shit ever.

343
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,150
But then he got famous and when he got
famous and he's doing blow every night,

344
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:45,090
and that's what's going to kill you.
Banging tens maybe had those.

345
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,400
It's that Maliki chick
that was always with him.

346
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,670
That was his girlfriend and she
was a fucking 10. I be like, man,

347
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:55,050
this guy's a troll and he's
got a 10 fame is sexy. Yeah.

348
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,900
And so he got big, he got famous
and he was partying all the time.

349
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:01,860
And I read his book, his brother's book
called the brother Sam. Interesting book.

350
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:04,790
And that's what he said in the
book that Sam just stop writing.

351
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,650
Just was partying all the time.
So then it was just coming up with stuff,

352
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,350
cheerleading for those dishes that
would come to Sam, you know? Yeah.

353
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,630
That was one of them. I mean, I still
loved him. No Man. But yeah, dude,

354
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,890
that's crazy managers.

355
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,890
And now how do you get into that? How do
you know that that's what you're into?

356
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,060
The guy who goes to the morgue and
beats off on the, how do you get there?

357
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,140
That's my whole question.

358
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,290
How do more guys who been busted
fucking bodies many times,

359
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,980
especially fresh ones. That's
happened many, many, many,
many times. Cause I think,

360
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,221
you know,

361
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:35,280
if you're some guy and you're sexually
attracted to women and this is a woman

362
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,920
that you could never possibly get
ahold of and no one could stop you from

363
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:42,120
touching her. There's no one around man,
you're in a quiet room with no windows.

364
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,110
And you know, she's on a pan and if you
want to, you can just start fingering her.

365
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,680
And some guys not, not only finger,
they fuck them. You know, I mean, it's,

366
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,880
that's happened so many times. He
says, look man, you get desensitized.

367
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,810
You're desensitized to those dead bodies
there really dis desensitized to dead

368
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:02,400
bodies when you see dead
bodies every fucking day of
your life. You know, I mean,

369
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:06,050
that's gotta be weird as
fuck has to be weird voice.

370
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:09,300
He had a couple dead bodies ever.
Man. It's always a very strange thing.

371
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,660
It the strange, but I wasn't like
freaked out. That was the whole, well,

372
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,980
maybe you were just trying to be strong.

373
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,720
What's weird is when he sees the
body's like stacked, like I went to a,

374
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,340
my grandfather died,

375
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,050
they were getting chairs out of this
room and I think it was a crowded day for

376
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,960
the funeral home. And, um,

377
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,390
I'm just kind of walking around like
thinking about things and the door opens

378
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:35,040
and there's my grandfather and like five
other dead people just sitting there in

379
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:38,520
this room with all these
chairs. And I was just like, Eh,

380
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,540
just the creepiest look and feel
and just was he, was he lying down,

381
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,700
he's laying down like you know,

382
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,980
just like there was a bunch of other
people that it's just like, like in slabs,

383
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,290
slabs right next to each other.
Like, like they're just, you know,

384
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,370
just like they were in a storage room,
you know,

385
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,810
like with all these
chairs and extra stuff.

386
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,360
Like like why are they just
wheeling it out in the storage room?

387
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:01,600
If you think about it,
it's amazing that we can go as like,

388
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,800
we've been so insulated by our complex
society that we can go like our whole

389
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,420
lives and never see a dead body.

390
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,510
Like a lot of people will go their
whole lives and never see a dead body.

391
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,200
Whereas back in caveman days, man,
you've saw some fucking bodies, man.

392
00:21:14,201 --> 00:21:19,190
Everybody saw bodies in the Roman
days cause you knew you. Yeah Dude,

393
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,840
I always say that's why like it was so
much easier to get married back in the

394
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,270
day cause you knew you were going to
die quicker. You know what I'm saying?

395
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:28,930
Death do us part was so much easier
because the w there was more violence out

396
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,520
there. Yes. As like the life
expectancy gets longer and longer.

397
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,050
People going to take that shit more
and more for granted. You know,

398
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:38,670
back then like you, you gotta get your
living in in 30 fucking years. Yeah. How,

399
00:21:38,671 --> 00:21:42,730
how old are you now? I'm 38 he'd be
dad, dude, Yad for sure mean by mommy.

400
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:46,810
I'd be long dead. And if I was
alive I would look like an old man.

401
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,210
Poor nutrition and no
fucking weightlifting.

402
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,790
I would look like shit out of gray hair.
You know,

403
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,410
I'd probably be taken no vitamins.

404
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:57,100
I just be eating porridge or whatever
the fuck village elder. Yeah. Whatever.

405
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,080
Whatever food that we killed that
day, you know. Horridge. Yeah,

406
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,591
man,
I was,

407
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,920
I've been watching the show the wild
within it's fucking good show man.

408
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:08,070
Some new show and a travel channel
with this dude goes and he,

409
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,700
he hunts a all over the world and he
hunts like out like uh, Lewis and Clark,

410
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,680
he went on this a one little expedition
where he took the same route that Lewis

411
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,990
and Clark took with a bunch of his
boys and they were shooting things with

412
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,260
muskets. They didn't shoot anything.
They couldn't shoot a fucking,

413
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:25,480
these guys have experienced hunter
and it never got close enough.

414
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,940
They caught Kotlow a couple of
fish and they barely survived.

415
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,620
One of the things that they
got was somebody had shot
a deer and left the deer.

416
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,100
All they took was like some of the
meat from the back of the deer,

417
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,310
which is like really common. Like guys
take the, what's called the backstrap.

418
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,270
It's like the lowing,

419
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,750
the Strip loin that goes against the
logic though the meat against your spine

420
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,390
and that's the only food that they found.
If it wasn't for that,

421
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,940
some hunter leaving a body behind,
you know,

422
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:51,500
they scavenged it and they're all
talking shit about this hunter the but me

423
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,150
malls. How many would have eaten
it too? If it wasn't all them,

424
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,620
it would have been a coyote.
It's not like it's going to go to waste.

425
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,620
It's in the fucking jungle, you
know? What do you think the crew,

426
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:03,480
the film crew's going through? I like, are
they big MACs by, they're like starving.

427
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:03,790
You know,

428
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:07,630
it's pretty crazy because last night I
watched one episode where he hunted a pig

429
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:08,590
with a knife.

430
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,790
They there in Hawaii and the way they
hunt pigs in Hawaii is you use pit bulls

431
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,340
and use two different types of dogs.

432
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:19,470
One type of dog goes and finds the pig
and they're they, they're the bang dogs.

433
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,530
So that tracking dogs,

434
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:25,000
they have the best sense of smell and
they can find hogs like miles away.

435
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:29,200
They can find old tracks and track them
down. So these dogs are barking. Row, row,

436
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,630
row, row. They let him know
and then the pit bulls come in,

437
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,330
the pit bulls come running in
and their armored pit bulls,

438
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,860
they have collars around their neck,

439
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:39,760
that protector next and they have Kevlar
vests on so the pigs can't bite through

440
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:43,780
their body. And it's because
pigs are nasty mouth fast.
And they have giant tusks.

441
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,410
Pigs are a weird animal man. When a
pig is in a, in a pigsty and you're,

442
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:50,720
you're on a farm and they're
all pink and cute and shit.

443
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,340
Pigs are the only animal that we know
of that morphs once it becomes feral.

444
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,430
So when you put pigs is
quickly as three weeks.

445
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,570
When pigs exist in the wild in
three weeks there for changes,

446
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,990
their tusks grow longer. Like they
literally become a different animal.

447
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,740
It's a fucking transformed. That's
why I like wild pigs have black hair,

448
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,170
that black crazy hair,
but like domestic pigs on,

449
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,730
most of them have like white hair.

450
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,370
Well there's something happens
to them when you let them free.

451
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,230
There's something about pigs going wild.

452
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:22,100
It actually forces like a
biological change. Survival. Micah.

453
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:26,470
Delicious Butterfly. So anyway,
this guy is out there and um, the,

454
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:30,980
the dogs are holding the pig down
and there's two different pigs.

455
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,120
So they have to stop both of them.

456
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,970
And so one of them they had to do without
the pit bulls had to do with a bang

457
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:38,000
dogs. And he's at this pig is fucking
these dogs up, man. Pick, pick,

458
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,880
keeps biting and biting the shit out
his dogs to putting holes in these dogs.

459
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,541
Really?
Yeah.

460
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:44,750
And the guy runs over and just stabs
the pig in the heart and it's all in a

461
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:48,680
river, you know? So it's like the whole
scene is like really fucking primal man.

462
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,620
Like he dives in the water and they're
fighting in the pigs trying to bite him

463
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:53,420
and he has to jump out of the way.

464
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,670
And then the dogs get in place and
then when the dogs are in place,

465
00:24:55,671 --> 00:25:00,140
the pig bites a dog and the guy just runs
over and slams the fucking blade right

466
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,990
between the ribs. Wow. Right
into the heart. It's dark dude.

467
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,030
And you gotta think like that,
some real hunting man.

468
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:08,240
You're hunting up pig with a knife.
Yep. And that's how they do it.

469
00:25:08,241 --> 00:25:11,540
The dog's hold them down, be apparently
that's the easiest way to do it.

470
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:14,950
I don't know why that makes any sense
at all. Why you wouldn't just fuck it.

471
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:18,560
I guess the only way to find them is
with the dogs and once you find them,

472
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:20,840
the dogs are buying them. You can't
shoot them because the dogs are there.

473
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,860
So it gets tricky.

474
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,490
So then you have to go and stab them
because apparently pigs are pretty fucking

475
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:29,120
smart and pigs, they see people come
in and they just get ghost. It's like,

476
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:32,250
you know, it's not as easy to track
them down as it is to like track a deer.

477
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,770
They're intelligent. They're
more intelligent than dogs. What,

478
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,430
what comedians do without like
discovery channel or any of that?

479
00:25:39,431 --> 00:25:42,710
I mean like how much material comes from
the discovery and the travel channel,

480
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,110
all that stuff.
There's some crazy shit out.

481
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,660
That's where all the freakouts come
from, man. If it wasn't for that shit,

482
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,280
I probably have a much saner
life, you know, wasn't,
wasn't from totally my world.

483
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:53,840
What is, where's my
worries? Where's the why?

484
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,850
It was the super volcano
is not really in my world,

485
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,820
but it is in my world because
I'm on fucking, you know,

486
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,820
on TV at two o'clock in the
morning watching some crazy signs,

487
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:05,270
channel special battle. We're all
gonna die. Hey, did you see the, uh,

488
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,070
on the Huffington post? A green blob in
the middle of deep. How crazy is that?

489
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,000
So what is it? What did they
think it is? I don't know.

490
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,530
They are seeing it creates stars.
Yeah. That's some crazy shit.

491
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,290
Stellar nursery. Yeah. The
colors are not delicate.

492
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:23,760
Keller's correct of the car's careering.
No, it said something about, yeah,

493
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,190
they embellish the colors. Like it's
not really a scope. Yeah, but man,

494
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,960
I mean it's six,
640 million light years away.

495
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:37,250
One light years. A trillion years.
She's trillion miles. Excuse me.

496
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:41,870
How crazy is that would be cool if we
found a star factory where we figured out

497
00:26:41,871 --> 00:26:44,220
how to make planets and stars and be like,
start sewing

498
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,460
planets. Like, no way, dude. I don't
happen to know where we do that.

499
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,330
You can buy a star and you and 900
people on that same star. Well, yeah,

500
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,240
yeah. I bought you a star, honey. Yeah.
Shut the fuck up. You don't own that star,

501
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,570
that star. Yeah, like you can name a star.

502
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,980
That becomes a real though and we all
become space travelers and like we ended

503
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:08,970
up like, no, you own that star
now and you can live on, you can,

504
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:10,530
if you become a Mormon brother,

505
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,530
you can have your own planet and your
own people and you make your own rules.

506
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,270
That's right.

507
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,210
They're supposed to be some new discovery
that was found today by the Hubble

508
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:20,330
telescope. I can't seem to find
it here. I'll find it eventually.

509
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,340
But just space itself, man. It's too
big. It's too virtual. Often mean.

510
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:29,120
Think about it. Do you ever try to think
about eternity and your brain just like,

511
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:33,410
nope, tap out. I tend to really go
on forever. That's the way it does,

512
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,450
but it's really tricky.
So what,

513
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,680
what happens is it goes to a certain
point and then you come back.

514
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,700
It's like a geometric design. It's
like, like it's, it's a shape.

515
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:47,990
Like the universe apparently is a shape.
It's a curved wall. There's, that's,

516
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,470
that's where it gets crazy. There's,
this doesn't make any sense,

517
00:27:51,471 --> 00:27:53,540
but what they think is
that there's, like, we,

518
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,190
we think of the universe is everything,

519
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,550
but apparently it's not just as our
solar system isn't everything just as our

520
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,190
galaxy is and everything. At first
it was a solar system. First of all,

521
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,940
we thought that our solar system was, this
is it, this is all there is out there.

522
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,010
And then we realize, oh no,
no, we're part of a galaxy.

523
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,410
And the galaxy is all there is out
there. Oh No, no, no. The galaxies,

524
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,480
a part of many galaxies,
which is part of the universe.

525
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,100
Well now they think that inside every
galaxy is a supermassive black hole that

526
00:28:16,101 --> 00:28:20,450
contains, and another universe.
And inside that universe is,

527
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:25,700
could be exactly like our universe or
a could have some completely different

528
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,510
structure.

529
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,630
I can't even understand. They can't
understand it. It's like when you look up,

530
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:32,640
we're, we're looking little ants
trying to, I mean, not even, you know,

531
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,710
you break it down.
Yeah,

532
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:38,390
we're mites on an ant's ass trying to
figure out fucking how Google works.

533
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,020
We were talking about last night,
the comedy club about whether, um,

534
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,200
you think people boned up on like
the space station they must have,

535
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,330
cause they put laws saying that they
can't do it. Yeah. That's so funny.

536
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:53,160
But that's why they want the Russians
there. So then bang some Russian chicks,

537
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,800
something that one, a astronaut who
drove cross state and their diaper.

538
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,890
I mean that's how crazy that chicken, so
you know, they're into some freaky stuff,

539
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,920
which I like.
I like

540
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,100
smart freaky chicks.

541
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,460
There's something very attractive about
getting a very smart girl and having her

542
00:29:08,461 --> 00:29:11,190
sane degrading shit. It just,
it's very fun for the beginning.

543
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:15,060
The problem with smart sex is I find that
most a smart chicks that really liked

544
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:18,570
me are fucking crazy.
And did you just play some music?

545
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,770
It sounded like it though.
I think it did. I think the,

546
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,600
the drum beats sort of going off anyway.
So I,

547
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,450
you know like the really smart ones
that are like kind of like, like,

548
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,470
like snarky and a lot of them are crazy.
You know,

549
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,080
and a lot of them like being a
smart chick is fucking hardest shit.

550
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,820
Cause a lot of dudes don't
care if you're smart,

551
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:37,910
they just want to stick your Dick.
They're dead inside you. They,

552
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,100
they want a fleshlight, you know, and
then they want love and relationship.

553
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,100
But most importantly you got to,

554
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,250
you got to feed this fucking addiction
that you have in your deck now you'd have

555
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,040
to get rid of some loads. So it's,
it's hard being a smart chick. I think.

556
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,440
I love it. And when they deal
with Douchebag, douchebag,

557
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,390
they just assume that you're
going to be a Douche bag too.

558
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:56,800
And so it's hard being a
girl, bro. It's can't be easy.

559
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,260
Can Be good to take care of babies.

560
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,640
And you got to assume that the dude's
going to help you out like you were.

561
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:05,510
You were going to completely
change your whole world.

562
00:30:05,511 --> 00:30:08,260
You're going to grow a human inside of
you and then you're not going to be able

563
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:11,200
to work cause you're gonna be able to
have to take care of this human or you

564
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:14,740
bring it to daycare and your kid gets
sick every fucking day of its life.

565
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,620
I have a buddy who as this kid in
daycare and he's like so sad about it,

566
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,510
he just can't afford to not
have his kid in daycare,

567
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,180
can afford to have his wife not work.
And you know,

568
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,090
actually they just broke up because
of all this. Now they're divorced.

569
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,610
But he's like, my kids always
say cause like it's horrible.

570
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:30,490
They're always confidence needs. And
he goes and he crushes my heart. Oh,

571
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:33,760
because it's like there's so many germs
over there. No, he's like a producer,

572
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:37,390
but he can't, he's not like a high level
producer so he can't get shit going, man.

573
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:40,210
It's fucking, you know when
in Hollywood man, when the,

574
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:42,520
when the recession hits
or hits for everybody.

575
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,430
So he was not making good
money and she's fucked.

576
00:30:45,431 --> 00:30:48,490
He's like picks up jobs here and there
and they're sporadic and in between he's

577
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:52,660
got a little live off unemployment. It's
horrible. Yeah, it's a grind, dude. So,

578
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:55,410
you know, my point is
for a chick man, it's,

579
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:59,680
it's a way more difficult situation just
simply by the virtue of the fact that

580
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:02,680
you have a growing human
being inside of you.

581
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:05,560
You can make a baby and then you
have to take care of this baby,

582
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:09,130
that baby completely vulnerable
for many, many, many years.

583
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,970
Whereas a man can just shoot loads and
women all over town and have a fucking

584
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:16,300
gang of these chicks watching after
his kids. You know, you can just like,

585
00:31:16,301 --> 00:31:19,100
who's done that? John's what's on
night guys named the football player,

586
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,540
the Bass basketball player that has a
fucking 80 killed Sean camp. Sean camp.

587
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,450
There you go. How many kids does that
guy have? I was reading this book.

588
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,920
I think he has eight kids. Damn.
There's one football lawyer.

589
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,100
They had 10 kids all over
the place too, right?

590
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:39,010
He couldn't stop smoking weed. So he lost,
he basically got kicked out of the NFL.

591
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,610
Now you're screwed. Whoa. He got kicked
out of the NFL because of we, yeah,

592
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:45,430
he had three violations. Who's
that? What's his not Ricky Williams.

593
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,390
He used to run for Buffalo, then he
got traded to Denver. I don't know man.

594
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,700
How crazy. They trying to keep football
players from smoking weed. Yeah.

595
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,710
One Time Charles Oakley said that
that like 80% of the MBA smoked.

596
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,720
We, yeah they can't, they can't have,

597
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,580
that's part of their contract negotiations
that they don't test for weed cause

598
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:10,120
weed it for basketball and for
pool for anything involving balls.

599
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,450
This is all I know for anything involving
feel and I don't mean balls like

600
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:14,284
you're nuts.

601
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,250
I mean anything involving orbs where
you're judging distances and it's like

602
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:22,750
these are like subtle feely things. You
know, weed makes you more sensitive.

603
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,830
So if you're more sensitive,
you're going to play basketball better,

604
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,070
you're going to play pool better.
You know you're going to fuck better.

605
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,420
And I think it also takes you out of
you so you don't overthink the moment.

606
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,990
And like sometimes if you watch basketball
guy will be so wide open and he'll

607
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:39,230
totally clink it cause he's too open. You
know, like this shit. Oh God, I'm so open.

608
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,064
I hope I hit this

609
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,180
thing. Yeah. Yeah. You let that other
thing talk to you. Don't fuck this up.

610
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,820
The little hat, the little boy and
get to talk to you when you're high.

611
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,640
You know when you're in the
groove in the zone, you know.

612
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,280
That's why I'm not in the VIP list.
He can't get into the club that night.

613
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,420
Going on stage. Stone is the best. I
can't do it. You can do it. I can't.

614
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:00,050
You have done it. Why are you lying? I
can't lie to him because we're Joe's.

615
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,400
Most comics say that
they can't do it like,

616
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:06,500
like you're one of the very
few people that I think can do,

617
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,160
but like I know for a fact
that I can't do it. All right.

618
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,060
It's so you can go to stoned.
You can definitely get two stone.

619
00:33:12,061 --> 00:33:14,850
Especially if you eat something like
I fucked up at city walk and guy.

620
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,590
He gave me this fucking cookie. I was an
idiot. I was like, Hey, he's a nice guy.

621
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,530
I'll just take a cookie.
I would more,

622
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,770
I would've given you special gloves and
a fucking aluminum briefcase if I had

623
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,990
that cookie inside of,
if I knew how strong that cookie was,

624
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:30,670
I'd have that thing attached to electrodes
and if it moves to a gland goes off.

625
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,770
It was ridiculously strong
cause they make them with Hash,

626
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,280
they don't make them with weed so they,

627
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,450
these guys just go the professional
stoners, those assholes,

628
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,140
they want to get blitzkrieg.
They don't want to think about things.

629
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,170
They just want to get so high that
it's like an amusement park ride.

630
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,270
Like you just feel like you're in like
yeah. That's how I felt when I would,

631
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,920
when I did, Ralphie may gave
me a pot Brownie and I just,

632
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,980
this next thing I know I'm like I'm naked
watching Ph one celebrity rehab cause

633
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:01,880
I couldn't get porn.
So that's the closest I can get to it.

634
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:06,500
What have you been watching the camp
at this time?

635
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,880
I didn't have access.
I didn't have my computer with,

636
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,320
I hadn't had gotten a Mac at that time.
If a cell phone? No, this was like, oh,

637
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,040
three years ago I didn't have that.
You didn't have a cell phone? Yeah,

638
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,560
I didn't have a cell phone.
The mid videos,

639
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,830
I guess I had [inaudible] three years ago.

640
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,390
Calculator t three one
eight zero zero eight.

641
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,930
What does that boobies turn it
upside and shut the fuck up?

642
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,170
You fucking child.

643
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,690
You could draw a porn before I would
watch the celebrity reality. You Call

644
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,750
Jason? I don't like sex. Celebrity
Rehab. I like drug celebrity. Rhea.

645
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,970
Is there a sexual library where yeah,
there was. Who was on that one? Um,

646
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:48,380
they had a couple porn stars. Earl's?
Yeah. Is there any guys on that? Yeah,

647
00:34:48,381 --> 00:34:52,430
there was a fill Verone was on that was
that he was a guy who was like, dude,

648
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,140
this is so funny. He's the drummer
of, uh, I forgot what the band is.

649
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,600
A camera. He was a drummer and some
eighties band and he get on there and he,

650
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,170
it's like he said he's addicted
to sex. Yeah. Poor guy.

651
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,180
But then the girls are talking and then
you can get addicted to anything. I know,

652
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:15,170
I know dudes who are so hung up on sex
that it's like they're not even horny and

653
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:19,610
they're trying to like keep racking up
scores. Yeah. It's like it consumes you.

654
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:23,720
I know guys whose careers
have been derailed because
there's such pussy hounds.

655
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,360
Yeah, that's true. Well it
becomes a massive distraction too.

656
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,770
Like if you have a lot of pressure,

657
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,230
you know you can distract yourself
with things like gambling,

658
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,060
addictions and stuff like
that where it's real.

659
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,300
What it really you're trying to do is
you're trying to avoid the pressure of

660
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,040
your career you're portraying to
avoid the, the hard work and all

661
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,870
the things that you really
need to get done. And you know,

662
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,450
I find myself like I have instant.

663
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,890
That's why the war of art
book is so fucking good.

664
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:48,630
If your rent it great book because
it deals with that deals with the

665
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,050
distractions and it, you know, calls it
resistance and that's really what it is,

666
00:35:52,051 --> 00:35:54,960
man. You, you know, when, when
life gives you a lot of pressure,

667
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,410
people go towards something to
distract him from them. Yeah.

668
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:59,340
Cause they don't want to deal with it.

669
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,380
They don't want to think about it
so they get obsessed with something.

670
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,800
It could be pussy, it could be
gambling, the gambling end pussy,

671
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,180
it could be a drug thing.

672
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,480
I think some people are also afraid
to make it too in some weird way.

673
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:11,230
They don't want to,
they like,

674
00:36:11,231 --> 00:36:16,200
they kind of just enjoyed the not having
the pressure of having to produce and

675
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,300
it kind of sabotage
themselves in a weird way.

676
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,370
Success is very hard and difficult.

677
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,550
I think a lot of people
sabotage themselves and are
afraid of success and those

678
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,001
are by the way,

679
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:27,930
the same people that are always talking
shit about other people that are

680
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:28,764
successful.

681
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,860
They're always like going after them
and pointing fingers at them and like,

682
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,551
you know,

683
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:36,820
I mean if you look at like anytime you
watch like you go to like TMZ or anytime

684
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,810
there's some celebrity story
and go look in the comments.

685
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,750
All the venom in the fight comments,
it was common.

686
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,100
Youtube is the worst. I
can't stand that shit. It's,

687
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:52,101
but I guarantee you that every single
person that it's fixating on Charlie Sheen

688
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:56,100
and you know whoever the fuck it is,
tiger woods, all the venom and venom,

689
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,760
those people are not paying this much
focus on their own life. They're just not.

690
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:04,980
If you're on youtube and you're getting
into a fucking three page flame war with

691
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:08,810
some other asshole that's
like Eh, you know, SRC seven,

692
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:10,360
seven on Prom,

693
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,050
you know that's his name and you're
going back and forth and you're trying to

694
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:15,210
win and that's is a distraction.

695
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,160
You're not thinking about
your life for it for sure.

696
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:18,840
There's some shit that
you need to get done.

697
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,690
There's some papers you need to fill
out or some bills you need to send in.

698
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,810
You're not doing everything you need
to do your, your, that's an addiction.

699
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,460
Just like anything else,
just like porn,

700
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:29,070
just so they can do whatever they
want because there's no repercussions.

701
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:31,710
Like there's no who's going to kick in
their door, in their mom's basement,

702
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,730
punch him in the face or say mean
shit they ever happened. He used to,

703
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:39,120
even when you sent an email or a letter,
rather, it had a return address. Right,

704
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:42,180
right. 100%. I remember one time, uh,

705
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:44,790
it was Kathy Griffin just
started hosting the, uh,

706
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,070
the New Year's Eve thing on CNN and she
was getting heckled and she said, well,

707
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:53,070
I'm coming to your job and kick the
dicks out of your mouth bump bump. Right.

708
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,420
Which is, you know, a thousand years old.
Jesus used that when he had a bad set.

709
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:59,280
You know what I'm saying?
I used that the last time I used that,

710
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:02,690
I shook my own head and I was like, what
the fuck did you do that? But anyways,

711
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm just got to do it.
I went on Youtube,

712
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:06,990
I just want to see what the comments
were. And they're like, she's so fast.

713
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:09,990
She's so crazy. It's so fun. I
go, you guys, I mean, she's good,

714
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:13,500
but that's the like the oldest line. And
they just started coming at me, right.

715
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:16,500
And this one guy just started really
trying to give me, and I'm like,

716
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:20,880
who is this guy? And he's like, and
everyone's like, yeah. To him. Keep going.

717
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,730
I'm like, really? Yeah. So I go to
his page, all of his videos lit,

718
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,640
and this is a guy,

719
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,690
all of his videos are like high school
boys dancing around with no shirts on.

720
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,750
Right. And I go, whoa. And I go
back. I go, okay everybody, Eve,

721
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:36,760
you really cheered for him. Go and take
a look at all of his videos. I save boom.

722
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,270
Didn't hear from him again cause it
was like he actually got hit when he

723
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:43,240
normally could just say whatever he
wants. There's no repercussion. Right.

724
00:38:43,241 --> 00:38:47,260
You've found his page was
is actually him. Yeah. Wow.

725
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,130
Wow.
Yeah.

726
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,500
People that when people are used
to being able to say something,

727
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:54,880
but getting a response to someone,

728
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:58,300
this is the first time ever you've been
able to just anonymously attack people

729
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,450
and then people start websites
about people and go after people.

730
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:04,130
People that don't even know
they have no, no. You know,

731
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,950
no real relationship with them. But they
fixate on them. Yeah, he got to let it go,

732
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:12,820
man. It's never easy. I get, and here's
the funny, the funniest comment is,

733
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:15,550
oh that's so gay.
Like you could do a video of,

734
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:18,430
you make an hour with the hottest chicken
world and there'll be some guy goes

735
00:39:18,431 --> 00:39:21,700
video ever. It's like it's not gay. It's
like I'm making out with some chick.

736
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:26,050
What are you talking about? I get
murdered all the time on my Facebook page.

737
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,340
The worst is when someone puts a video
up for you that you can't control and so

738
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,170
the comments there and
you can't really like,

739
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,830
I don't mind if you say
I don't like to fixate.

740
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,390
Do you fix it and comments
and the [inaudible] I do
like to a while. It's nice,

741
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,170
they have a good point and be like,
you know what? That's a good point.

742
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,410
You can keep that up there. If they're
just saying some stupid ass shit,

743
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:46,570
I'll be like, ya'll either hit
them or delete the comment.

744
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,560
So you actually had gotten arguments with
these people on your like youtube page

745
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:54,600
and shit, you know once I want
you do? No, but I've seen it.

746
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,610
Have you seen him what it is on Facebook
or maybe it was a youtube or something

747
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:00,011
like that.

748
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:04,240
I still would go on Facebook one where I
got in a fight with a chick because she

749
00:40:04,241 --> 00:40:08,890
called, I did a video called I love
black people. Oh, that was good. And I,

750
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,420
it's basically was a base off of when
we were in Canada and we didn't see any

751
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:15,670
black people. I'm like, you
know, I Ms. Black people.

752
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:19,120
So I decided to do a video called
I love black people. And I'm like,

753
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:22,000
and I would tell them I love black
people and we'd hug and I'd list all the

754
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:25,510
reasons I love them. And this girl's
like, you're so racist. I'm like,

755
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,490
the video's called,
I love black people.

756
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,610
I'm hugging Black Cape
Board around Hanky grades,

757
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,650
finding black people in hugging him.
That's how is that racist? Yeah.

758
00:40:32,651 --> 00:40:35,670
And we just went made in the video after
we did that Canada to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,650
We went to weird parts of Canada too,
right?

760
00:40:37,651 --> 00:40:41,560
We were like in grand prairie
and loved it is Saskatoon.

761
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,950
We were like way up there,
man.

762
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:46,890
Canadian girls are the white
versions of Mexican girls. Yeah.

763
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,330
That they're there. What do you mean
they're gray? Your nigger? Yeah. Yeah.

764
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,570
Yeah, I'd love it. But
they're great in bed. They at,

765
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,550
they have this amazing ability to be
both a freakin bed and it like a good

766
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:04,390
girlfriend. You know what I'm saying?
Right. Like the white girls in America,

767
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,000
they can't, it's either one or the
other. What do you think that is?

768
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:09,340
You think that just were
repressed here and there?

769
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,730
Not because they don't have a much more
European sexual attitude in Canada,

770
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,790
especially Montreal. I think they
can have that though. Uh, yeah,

771
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:18,670
I think it is a little repression cause
if you talked to anybody, you're like,

772
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,280
you know,
where's the greatest groupies or this?

773
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:25,120
They'll always say like Utah because those
girls have like one shot at greatness,

774
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,490
if you know what I'm
saying. Oh really? So like,

775
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,770
I'm like bands say that like the
greatest groupies are in Utah. Yeah,

776
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,130
I like it that who told you that? Ah, I
was, I talked to a couple of porn stars.

777
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,770
I said were the craziest people.
They're like Mormons, Utah,

778
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,920
real gene Simmons said when he
ranked like we're the best groupies.

779
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,670
They said Utah. Wow. Yeah. I remember
when I did some with Vince Vaughn,

780
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,760
I went on a tour and we were on this bus
and it's the closest I'll ever get to

781
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:51,050
be in a beetle.
Right.

782
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,340
I just like driving this huge buzz and
people going crazy and we were driving

783
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:59,360
around and we just stopped somewhere and
this girl's walking with her boyfriend.

784
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:03,380
She just jumps on the bus and leaves
with us. He jumps in, his car,

785
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:07,520
falls us and I'm like, if
I doubt followed you. Yeah.

786
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:11,120
What would you do though? We
get rid of that bitch. Yeah,
no, I've seen that before.

787
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:11,720
I've seen,

788
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,890
I've been at shows where there's a guy
with a girl and the girl is just like got

789
00:42:15,891 --> 00:42:19,970
her hands on my chest and asking me
where we're going after this show. Yeah.

790
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:22,130
And you want to just go,
go to the dude, dude, dude,

791
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,460
you got to get out of this relationship
man. This shit will rot your years.

792
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,300
Cause if you're a fucking dude, and
especially if she's hot. Oh yeah.

793
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:32,090
Fucking trapped.
I've met a lot of dudes that were like,

794
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,640
they really shouldn't be banging that
check. And all of a sudden they are,

795
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:37,670
and you know, and you're stuck in
someplace like some small town somewhere.

796
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:38,840
You know,
you're in Louisville,

797
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:41,930
Kentucky or something with this crazy
bitch and there's not a lot of, you know,

798
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,200
selection. Everybody wants to fuck her,
so you don't want to let her go. Yeah,

799
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:48,470
well that's the trap because you can
go into somewhere, you can go into,

800
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:50,660
some were killed in this
gorgeous girls coming on you.

801
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:53,240
She's not going to tell you they're
crazy as boyfriend's over there.

802
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,600
That's what happened to Mick young
when we had a, yeah, Mike Young though,

803
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:00,940
you can't really rely on his
stories whether I was there.

804
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,680
One is hang on a girl and a guy
beat him up. No, no, no, no, no, no.

805
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,514
This is what happened.

806
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,240
We were just walking around and he picks
up this chick asked her to come to our

807
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:11,930
show. She comes to show we're hanging out
the club. I'm not, this is true story.

808
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,180
Hey, out of the club, I go
down on the dance floor.

809
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:18,160
This dude just walks in the club,
just doesn't even say,

810
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,170
just walks up and just
fucking starts throwing bombs.

811
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:24,020
I'm Mike Young and all the sudden
I hear screaming, I look up,

812
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,620
Mike Young sends up, he's like triple. He
watches her face just bleeding. I'm like,

813
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,260
dude,
so I run up but I run this way.

814
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:34,700
The guy runs this way so I run
this way. See what's up. He's gone.

815
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:37,280
I couldn't even find him.
And then so the guy just ran up,

816
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,220
punched him a couple times and then
ran that. Just drop haymakers on them.

817
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:43,520
10 Mike had never spoken
to this guy. No War. No.

818
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,760
I saw the whole thing from the guy.

819
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,350
I know who Mike was cause
he knew who the girl was.

820
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,360
So Mike was sitting next to the girl.
So she just,

821
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,120
he just walked up and started blasting.
Yeah, that was his girlfriend.

822
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:57,920
That's Mike Young's Karma Bro.
Relative to that guy gets lethal dude,

823
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,510
that guy.
And that's the craziest thing.

824
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,480
I was dancing with some chick and he
got to take Mike on here by the way,

825
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,100
just cause we talked about
him so much and was like,

826
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:08,210
who the fuck is Mike Young Chick? I was
hooking up with Mike Young. How dare you,

827
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,530
he's friends with Leonardo Dicaprio.
My shot on entourage.

828
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:15,230
You ever hear that one? I'm watching.
All of a sudden it's like blah blah blah.

829
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,320
And Mike Young, I'm like, they did
not just say Mike Young name Larry.

830
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:22,070
That's hilarious. Some of his other
buddies. Right on that. So, um, so what,

831
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,040
what were just in the middle of
something? The Mike Young Ram. Yeah.

832
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,660
Yeah that's what happened to him
almost having to Rick Ingram too.

833
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,250
I heard that too. Like he's in Alaska
and he went to some bar with some chick

834
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,340
and uh,
they walk in the bar,

835
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:38,370
the girl's boyfriend's there and her
boyfriend's friend just surrounding me was

836
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:41,730
like, I didn't know. Boom, I'm
gone. And that's the biggest thing.

837
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,650
It's due to get mad at other dudes because
of their girlfriends. A whore. Well,

838
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,010
Jesus Christ, that is the dumbest
shit ever. Like, listen man,

839
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:51,900
if your girl is a good girl,
if she was down with you,

840
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:55,960
she would not be here with Mike Young.
You fuck just give up. You do it.

841
00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:00,240
No problem. You just got an emotional
issue that you need to fucking sort out.

842
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:04,290
You're not good enough to get a good
girl. You fuck, he's crazy. So anyways,

843
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,990
I'm like, Mike, this
chick knows that dude.

844
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:09,720
There's no reason that guy would come
up to you and just start blasting you.

845
00:45:09,721 --> 00:45:11,580
And she's like, I didn't know him.
And then we just kept prodding.

846
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,970
Here's how crazy Mike youngest just guys
buck kicked for hanging out with a hot

847
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:15,390
chick.

848
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,560
I'm sitting in the Er of the hospital in
walks the hottest blonde I've ever seen

849
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:22,080
in my life. She's like,
where's Mike Young? I'm like,

850
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:25,800
you're gotta be kidding me dude.
He's guy, girl. Meet him at the Er.

851
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,570
She was so hot.

852
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,340
Why would he have a girl meet him at the
Er cus she's hot and I might get a scum

853
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:34,650
bag. I'm like, I wonder if I can
bang this chick at the hospital.

854
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,570
Steal her from like,
I mean,

855
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:40,170
I just wanted to hit it like I want to
cross it off my list. Oh, that's funny.

856
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,640
Would Mike Young be pissed?
I think he had bigger problems at that.

857
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,540
His face is they're putting it together
like Mr Potato head at that point. Yeah.

858
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,890
Came back. Better looking. That's just
a guy like John likes girls. He does.

859
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:57,450
I wanted to do this whole a show where
I take like Mike Young, Brian Kaylin,

860
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,260
uh,

861
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:03,260
Steve Byrne and Sergio love and then Mike
Black and we go on a tour and it's who

862
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:07,800
can tap the most ass. But once you
get an STD, you're off the show.

863
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:10,530
Brian Cowan is married and he doesn't
do that anymore. No, I know that I'm,

864
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:13,530
this was years ago, that store off
that show. Okay. I'm taking them off.

865
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:15,720
Let me put it online.
That's not fair because he's going to,

866
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,780
he would beat all of them.
No, he wouldn't. Yeah, that's
the whole thing at the end.

867
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:21,450
It's Mike Black [inaudible]
who would just fuck anything.

868
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,300
He'll just take the other ones.
It's the right place.

869
00:46:26,301 --> 00:46:30,840
Some cheetahs only get to to eat what
they can catch when the leopards and

870
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:33,600
hyenas aren't around. Right.
That's just how it goes. You know,

871
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,400
if a cheetah take something down,
the hyenas go,

872
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:38,550
I'll take that bitch and they come in and
the cheetahs have to run away was just,

873
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,580
I have no problems with that part of
the game. I have no problems of that.

874
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,930
Is Mike blacks parents have photos of
themselves on this? That'd be hilarious.

875
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,420
That would be you go to it like there.
How does,

876
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,710
I mean my black is a comic that does.

877
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,800
I'd known for always having a
photo of himself on his shirt.

878
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,640
Every time you see him for years,
he wears the exact same shirt. Oh,

879
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,120
picture of himself on. Okay, so your
sensor, do his parents are the same crime.

880
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,690
He so devoted to the fuck. Would they
know what you're talking about? Yeah. Why?

881
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:07,860
Just explain it. You had to,
you get stuck. Mike Young books,

882
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:10,910
a bunch of commercials are, he's on
fire right now. A commercial art.

883
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,000
He's always doing commercials.

884
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:14,340
He's become more successful for
commercials and anything else.

885
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,580
He is a such a good actor.
He booked a subway commercial.

886
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:21,260
Doesn't look like in any way he'd ever
do work at subway unless he was like

887
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:22,710
their accountant.
You know what I'm saying?

888
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:26,430
Like he does not look like he's making
like sandwiches or some shit like that.

889
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,200
He doesn't do you,
does he look like a fast food employee?

890
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:33,820
The you really pull it off.
Yeah. Where's the homeless look?

891
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:37,600
He's got that. He's got one of
those. I could be anywhere. Looks,

892
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,580
I've never seen a a fast food employee
cause we live in Los Angeles and they're

893
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,650
all Mexican. Yeah, that's
what we were saying.

894
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:48,740
I just want to kill like Indian
casinos, brother. Really?

895
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,100
I'm the champ of the Indian cause
you do a lot of Indian cuisine.

896
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,630
I love them too. They're like the new
cat skills. You know what I'm saying?

897
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,150
Just you're just rocking India.

898
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:58,450
I just did my first two hour
set and you did two hours.

899
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,010
Where in Oklahoma, man, I did this
place called the Fire Lake. Best time.

900
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:07,000
The people that are so cool.
Really? And I'm like, oh
dude, it's the funniest thing.

901
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,590
I love going in the places and I just
start interviewing people because I just

902
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:12,401
like to get to know,
like,

903
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,190
it's almost like quantum leap where you
like jump in somewhere and you're like,

904
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,590
okay, what are the rules of
this place? What's going on?

905
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:19,210
How am I going to solve this problem?

906
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,430
So I just start interviewing
people and I'm like,

907
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,930
so you guys got any Mexicans here?
He's like, Eh, down south, you know,

908
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:28,990
a little father down south and
this is true. I go, how about Jews?

909
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:33,640
You got any juice? He's like,
oh, we don't do that here.
I'm like, what? How? He goes,

910
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:36,880
Whoa, we don't do that here. Wow.
And he starts telling me how,

911
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:41,740
like he's had the Klan knock on his
door and give him applications to join.

912
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:45,820
He's like, I won't do a shit
ton. I'm asking if you ever
hook up with the Mexican.

913
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:49,990
He's like, oh, no, no, no. I'm like, how
black chick? Not My family would hate me.

914
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:53,560
I'm like, really? It's 2011 wow.

915
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,260
You're not banging fucking minorities.
I love that shit.

916
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,170
[inaudible] Blake Griffin style.
You know what I'm saying?

917
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,120
That's pretty crazy that they do that, but
nicest crowd, two hours, just crushing.

918
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,950
Wow. Here's another joke. I'm
done. Why Pat? Pat? Bam. So yeah,

919
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,940
you think now because of the Internet
will obviously these people aren't the

920
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:15,310
coolest if they're talking
all this crazy racist shit,

921
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,190
but do you think that they'll use
a nice guy though? I mean like,

922
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,080
I know that sounds nuts. Well he wasn't.
He's just, he's stuck in this. Yes.

923
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,350
I think it's, yeah. Hmm.
That's an interesting argument,

924
00:49:26,351 --> 00:49:27,910
but I think if you're
connected to the Internet,

925
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:30,970
and this was what going to be my point,
at a certain point in time,

926
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:32,590
you realize like,
you know,

927
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,420
you can find the right information and
the right people to hang out with and

928
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:41,080
people can get access to information in
places where they never could before.

929
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,950
Like if you were stuck in some small
town in Oklahoma back in the day,

930
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,570
that's where your environment, that's like
those, that's how you grew up. You know?

931
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,880
I mean you had to get the fuck out of
there and go to college in New York or

932
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:54,790
something to really break out of it.
Right. 100 but a lot of people did,

933
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:57,240
but now you don't because
of the Internet you're,

934
00:49:57,241 --> 00:50:00,910
you're always getting access to all
kinds of shit online. Like look,

935
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:05,380
my message board, Twitter, all kinds of
shit. There's always new information,

936
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:09,220
new intelligent discussions, maybe
discussions you can't have in your town,

937
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,960
but you can have them on, on, you know,
on a message board. You go for it,

938
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:16,450
you go, you searched his
stuff. I find that people,

939
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,540
most people don't want to do that
and I think most of the damage gets,

940
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:21,430
everyone hates Fox News
and all that stuff.

941
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,330
I really think like most of the damage
in terms of misinformation is done on the

942
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:28,910
local news level. Have you ever
watched local news is it's brutal,

943
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,220
crazy Google stuff that
they're saying you're like,

944
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:35,660
that is so far from the truth, but
nobody has any, they don't know that.

945
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,880
I watched this one on marijuana,

946
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,490
this local new show that
were talking about marijuana.

947
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,010
This is new strain of marijuana.

948
00:50:43,011 --> 00:50:47,390
Like it's like it's so
strong it's actually causing
people to go insane and they

949
00:50:47,391 --> 00:50:49,640
were like real serious and reading
their notes and I was like,

950
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:53,750
why you can't just say that.
It's information and the local level.

951
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:54,351
That's where it was.

952
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:59,000
The other thing it said and possibly could
be deadly like constantly like in the

953
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,690
realm of the only way we
can be deadly as if someone,

954
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:06,680
he ties together some like 50 pound
bundles and throws him out of one of those

955
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,480
fucking drug plans and they land on
your head. That's the only way we'd,

956
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,040
his deadline,
unless it's some kind of,

957
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:17,750
we were there that was deadly about is
there stuff added to it like you know

958
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,430
like where people put cocaine on weed,
why people did it.

959
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:24,560
When you can do to be so strong you think
you might die. I've been there like,

960
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,423
oh dude,
this is it.

961
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:31,340
I got Chris Mcguire high once and he
swore that it was, it was, he was laced.

962
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:35,210
He didn't know. He had never had some
of that real strong California medical.

963
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:39,440
We'd especially like a see a real
strong sativa. Most guys like,

964
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,620
well people don't know is you know, most
of the weedy get all across the country.

965
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:45,740
If you're not in a medical program,
you're usually getting into,

966
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:47,390
cause it's easier and cheaper to grow.

967
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,660
But the sativa is a totally different
kind of high and when you give it to

968
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:54,500
someone like choir, it's not
just Chris regards, a very
funny comic, but he's just,

969
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,700
he doesn't get stoned a lot.

970
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,160
And we got him baked one night in the
back area of the comedy store and we were

971
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:01,700
a blitzkrieg so it was
me and him and Joe Diaz.

972
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,080
So he's trying to keep up with me and
Joe does keep up with Joe does, you know?

973
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,990
And that he was convinced.
It was convinced.

974
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:11,390
He was convinced he was on some drugs.
Now there's something in this,

975
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,510
something in this. I'm like, yeah,
it's called good. We'd sign. Yeah,

976
00:52:14,511 --> 00:52:18,770
that sounds like a girl before too. It
sounds like a girl who liked d gets drunk,

977
00:52:18,771 --> 00:52:21,110
does some stuff in the next day. It's
like, oh, I wouldn't have done it.

978
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,810
Someone had to slip me something.
No, you guys got a little crazy.

979
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:24,501
You know what I think it is?

980
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:27,040
A lot of people use their bowls like
especially when you're out in a place and

981
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:28,790
you're like, you want to hit
this and you're like, okay,

982
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:29,810
but what they don't tell you is like,

983
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:31,940
oh last night I smoked
hash and that you know,

984
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:35,540
and there's Hash and that bowl or cause
I smoked a hit off of somebody the other

985
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:37,720
day and it tastes like
Poper read and attune to.

986
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,400
That reminds me of like when I
used to smoke opium and I'm like,

987
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,460
that tastes like opium. And I wonder
if this guy had opiate and that bowl.

988
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,720
You've flats. Whoa, you were smoking
opium like fucking Wyatt Earp and shit.

989
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,340
Chinese 10 like what was that?

990
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,930
How is that high opium and it
was pretty sweet. It was mellow.

991
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,920
Just mellow. Hi Character. I
mean that's basically heroin man.

992
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:01,760
It's fucking see babies crawling
on the ceiling or anything.

993
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,700
Well you don't see that on heroin, right?
Heroin is on a hallucinogen heroin.

994
00:53:04,701 --> 00:53:07,250
I don't like needles. I
don't think so. The movie.

995
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:09,330
Trainspotting was all
about the hallucinogens.

996
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,590
It depends on how long you've been doing
it. You know, it's like if you do math,

997
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:15,800
you're not going to be like terror,
you know, painting the House.

998
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:18,320
But if you do it like for
like two weeks straight,

999
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,080
you're probably gonna think
your house needs to get painted.

1000
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:23,990
I thought for sure heroin was Eddie Bravo
always dated a bunch of pitches that

1001
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:26,100
were hooked on speed and he used to tell

1002
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,290
me that like he had like
all these like rules,

1003
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,420
like how you could tell
when chicks your date,

1004
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:33,900
we're on speed and one of them was,
their fucking house is spotless,

1005
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,380
their house is spotless and they're
always cleaning and like these pitchers

1006
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,540
never eat and they're always tough.

1007
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:41,700
They're never tired who never eating
and they never tired. And he was like,

1008
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:44,520
the best thing about them is that you
could fuck them in the ass because there

1009
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:47,130
was never any poop in there.
That's hilarious.

1010
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,360
That sounds like survival guide.
The banging meth heads.

1011
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,880
That's hilarious dude.

1012
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,450
I always taught the sham wow guy was on
math because if you ever listened to the

1013
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,800
commercial,
he's always like,

1014
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,190
well how would you spend it on cleaning
supplies month? They're like 60 $70.

1015
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:05,900
It's like who's doing that much cleaning
pro? Unless your meth out of your mind.

1016
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:09,810
He's definitely doing something cause
he had a fight with a prostitute with a

1017
00:54:09,811 --> 00:54:14,250
prostitute, bit his tongue. So
he tongue kissing a prostitute.

1018
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:17,490
She bit down on his tongue and
he punched her in the face.

1019
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:21,300
Is that new movie that came out?
It's going to move in. Yeah.

1020
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:25,350
He's like producing movies now. And how
much money do you make off that channel?

1021
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,910
Millions.
Millions.

1022
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,430
He actually did that old movie that
the New York Times gave zero stars too.

1023
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:37,020
You ever hear about what someone was
like Bobby, Leonid and wheels per Reezy.

1024
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:40,260
Do you remember that movie? Didn't
they make that in Mexico? Yeah,

1025
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:42,570
it's like Joe Dns.
We're supposed to be on that movie.

1026
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:44,220
But something happened like there were,

1027
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:47,040
there were supposed to send him like
money in advance or something like that

1028
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:49,590
cause he thought it was shady and
he didn't go. That's the sham. Wow.

1029
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:52,830
Guy made this. But that's funny because
the new one has like Lindsay Lohan,

1030
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,460
there's a part in it and stuff like
that. Well guys, maybe she was high.

1031
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:57,120
Where's Lindsey?

1032
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,450
But the movie like cracked out Lindsey
Cause I got a shot with cracked out

1033
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,050
Lindsey. Jesus Freak Lindsay,
she's thanking us for mine,

1034
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:09,000
was banging her buddy of mine who's in
a band. It was a really crazy story man.

1035
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,750
He was a real good dude man.
And um,

1036
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:16,590
I've never seen anybody get hooked on
drugs more clearly. Like, you know,

1037
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:20,100
like you hang out with someone once and
then you see them again like six months

1038
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:20,640
later.

1039
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,640
Like I hung out with him once and he was
like super cool and friendly and happy

1040
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,160
and he'd been really doing a lot of
yoga and he's like, man, you know,

1041
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,920
I just found out when I exercise,
like you're going to think clearer.

1042
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:33,090
I'm really into that lately.

1043
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:36,600
And I kinda like just cut way back in
the party and I don't know what the fuck

1044
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:37,320
happened to him,

1045
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,260
but then I saw him six months later and
he was like trying to sell me a stereo

1046
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:44,280
or something. Yeah, just jacked
out and shaking. And it was,

1047
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:45,300
it was warm out,

1048
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,600
but this mother fucker was freezing and
he was like covering himself with his

1049
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:51,990
jacket. What? He was talking to me and
it was like so horrible. It was like, I,

1050
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:55,810
I watched it like a dude who had gotten a,
you know, he's like, he's been infected.

1051
00:55:55,811 --> 00:56:00,000
She by the Stereo. No, no sir. I
love disc cracked discounts, Bro.

1052
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:04,200
I had a fat TV for awhile, for 20 bucks.
Was Real kid sold it to me. I'm like,

1053
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:07,010
you're moving right? Oh yeah.
Yeah. I'm moving. I got a
it, but I'm like, okay, cool.

1054
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:10,710
Any Bucks? Nice television. It's that
amazing that they need it so bad.

1055
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:15,060
They're willing to give you a TV for 20
bucks. What is that evolutionary step?

1056
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,880
The fuck is, I don't give a shit. Is
it stolen? It might be there as bro.

1057
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,410
A lot of people before
they start stealing,

1058
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:22,090
they start selling their own shit really
cheap because that's the only shit.

1059
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,183
I mean if they can,

1060
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,080
if it's different than you waiting six
hours of getting 200 bucks or selling it

1061
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:28,060
right now and getting 20 and
then getting high right away.

1062
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:31,000
A lot of guys will just take that 20 yeah.
I don't know if its evolution.

1063
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:32,200
I just think people,

1064
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,850
we've gotten so away
from our primal roles.

1065
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:39,430
Do you know what I'm saying?
That people are Borden.

1066
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,710
I mean they don't know what to do with
themselves because we're, you know,

1067
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,960
it's back to where I'm meant to
be hunting. They're meant to be.

1068
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:48,250
Women are meant to be raising babies and
you know the way I've always described

1069
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:52,060
it as that we have this ancient hardware,

1070
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,180
these ancient bodies that are you still
like a certain amount that we need a

1071
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:58,000
certain amount of input.
We're designed to like,

1072
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,730
like the reason why people need
human touch. We need camaraderie.

1073
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:02,990
Like if you don't have human touch,
it doesn't seem like you should.

1074
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,580
That should like 100% of babies
can die if human 100% Oh,

1075
00:57:07,581 --> 00:57:11,620
I mean it's like it's a real needy. The
Emmys, it's a need. It's not, you know,

1076
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:13,780
so where did that evolve from?

1077
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:16,630
Will that evolve from the fact that we
need to stay together as tribes and this

1078
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:17,680
is the way we bond together.

1079
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,830
Like we literally need each other and if
we're separated from each other for any

1080
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:23,710
long lengths of time, we feel
terrible. I don't get sick.

1081
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:27,040
You never read a book called, why do
beautiful people have more daughters?

1082
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,670
I think I might talk to you about that.
They talk about how like human beings,

1083
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:35,560
we're still wired like cavemen,
we have very primal drives inside us.

1084
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:36,130
And then he,

1085
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:41,130
they say it takes 10,000 years for some
thing to either leave us or a new way of

1086
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:46,570
thinking. It takes that long to
cycle out. It makes sense. I mean,

1087
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:50,560
how else could it do it quickly? But the
world is changing so fast that, you know,

1088
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:52,210
I mean it's,
it's just,

1089
00:57:52,211 --> 00:57:54,940
it's a completely different
environment than 10,000 years ago.

1090
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,730
Every single aspect of it
from gathering food. You know,

1091
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:00,550
I was thinking about this the other day.
I pulled into a Wendy's.

1092
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:02,740
I was hungry and I've got a cheeseburger
and I'm sitting there in my car,

1093
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:06,280
he and his cheeseburger. I'm like,
how did I get meat so quick? You know,

1094
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:11,180
literally like it was a minute between
the time that I talked in this speaker to

1095
00:58:11,181 --> 00:58:14,020
the time I'm biting down his cheeseburger.
It was one minute.

1096
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,740
It was so god damn fast. I pulled up, I
gave him the money to God gave me a bag.

1097
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,880
I'm like, really? This is it.

1098
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:21,460
And then I sit there and I'm eating
this cheeseburger and then I'm like,

1099
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,290
this is so I want some Wendy's.

1100
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,860
I want to be amazed by fast
food that's being baked.

1101
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:28,721
But I was thinking,

1102
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:32,350
it's so incredible that I have a piece
of a dead animal that's cooked already

1103
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,800
and it's in my mouth and it's
one crazy, right? I mean,

1104
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:39,190
it's fast food is really
a motherfucker because we,

1105
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,470
we all these other things
that we think are important,

1106
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:43,090
like we've got to rush around
and get this and get that done.

1107
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,610
That's not really what's important.
What's important is sustenance.

1108
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,010
You have to be able to feed yourself.
You've got to be able to clothe yourself.

1109
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:49,780
You've got to have loved ones around.
You got to have a good time.

1110
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,420
That's what's really important,
but all of it's fucking shit.

1111
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,880
I've got a meeting at five and I got to
get here and I got to make this happen.

1112
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,220
The meeting meeting is going to make
sure that my career moves forward in a

1113
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:57,881
certain direction.

1114
00:58:57,881 --> 00:59:00,820
Then I'm going to work more hours and
I don't have time for food, you know?

1115
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:04,060
But Shit, man, what are you doing
this for? Like where's this going?

1116
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,620
What happens at the end?

1117
00:59:05,621 --> 00:59:09,340
You get up fucking bag of gold and you
get to run off to Leprechaun land or yeah,

1118
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,980
we'll just get a fucking
heart attack and and shit.

1119
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,560
Your pants and your bed while you're
clutching onto your chest. You know,

1120
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:16,570
you die in a puddle of your own diarrhea.

1121
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:19,270
Would a fucking busted open heart
raising because you've been,

1122
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,400
because you've been on a diet,

1123
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,240
pill, fucking freight train. That was
my diarrhea sound. That was the sound.

1124
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:30,890
That was great with the heart
attack sound. What was it?

1125
00:59:30,891 --> 00:59:32,280
Hard tax.
So how do you make a hard

1126
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:38,540
Brian still rocking the cigarettes, man.
He was, are you talking about health?

1127
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:43,310
I smoke cigarettes because my
grandpa's smoked cigarettes forever.

1128
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:47,390
Yeah, I need my, my
grandpa like cigarettes,

1129
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:50,600
but he smoked pipe tobacco like out
of pipes are actually good for you.

1130
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:55,120
It's done. Bam. Oh yeah. But it's not a
huge blow out. More smoking a cigarette,

1131
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,380
but you don't inhale that. You
don't inhale, that doesn't fuck.

1132
00:59:57,381 --> 01:00:02,000
Your lungs are amazed when
I hear people still smoke.

1133
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:06,650
It just blows my mind because the
backhoe in medical doesn't taste good.

1134
01:00:06,651 --> 01:00:09,620
What is he? Yeah, well tobacco
is actually been shown medically.

1135
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:14,621
Nicotine rather has been shown medically
to actually have a beneficial aid to a

1136
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:18,050
lot of different things. You know,
nicotine is actually not that bad for you,

1137
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:21,320
especially in like small doses.
Nicotine is not what's really dangerous.

1138
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:26,330
What's really dangerous as probably the
509 on the additives in cigarettes and

1139
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,700
they're designed to make you remember that
Russell Crowe movie the insider. Yeah.

1140
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,330
Went over all the shit that date,
that carbon dioxide to right.

1141
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,190
It's not good for either being anything.

1142
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:36,950
Smoke is bad and that's why we're
hitting the vaporizer. Right, right.

1143
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,230
I feel way better after
using the vaporizer. Then
I'd do smoking joints stoned.

1144
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,270
Really? Yeah. I don't feel stoned at
all right now let's go back in there.

1145
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:48,460
So that's what I'm saying. I just seems
like vaporizers to me, for the most part,

1146
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:51,530
it's waste. We'd like that much
weed that you put in there.

1147
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,870
You could have had a joint and we
got all been fucking blown out.

1148
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:59,060
It's a health thing. That's the
reason why it's there. I mean,

1149
01:00:59,061 --> 01:01:03,230
if you have a joint a day, who gives
a fuck, that's not that bad for you.

1150
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:07,770
If you're doing Joey Diaz tight smoking
where you're just nonstop joints or

1151
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,430
against bad. Yeah. But Joe
d is self medicating you.

1152
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,250
You guys talk amongst yourself.
Want to get some weed?

1153
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:17,200
So Sam you have the 90 showed them
morrow right at the end of frog.

1154
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:21,780
Very excited about it. Um, who's
Doug Benson is on it right then sin.

1155
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:26,570
Jenna Hays. Joe Hays is nice. Yeah
we got some fun people coming down.

1156
01:01:26,571 --> 01:01:31,220
Jeff Richards going to be playing drunk
girl. No Way. That's kind of cool.

1157
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:31,941
I actually,

1158
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:34,550
that was one of the few characters from
the old Saturday night lights I used to

1159
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:38,000
actually enjoy watching was Jeff.
Richard says the drunk girl but now he's,

1160
01:01:38,001 --> 01:01:42,650
that's considered old super blue dream
lesion. Gentlemen, soother blue dream.

1161
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,470
Ari's a full on a stoner now.
I,

1162
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:49,280
I guess I didn't realize on
tour with them I'm like wow.

1163
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,950
When I first moved out to California,

1164
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:57,170
Dunkin in Ra were like my two first
friends and we would like always like film

1165
01:01:57,171 --> 01:02:00,260
videos. Like Duncan was always trying
to be famous with his little Hobo,

1166
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:02,960
a video guy. So it would make
little videos for him. And,

1167
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,130
and one time I got stoned in Ari's like
didn't smoke weed. And I was like, dude,

1168
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:10,760
just smoke it. This is actually the
shittiest weed you could possibly buy.

1169
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,160
Meanwhile, it's like the, it
was the best we'd ever, I just,

1170
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:17,490
so he fills up the bond grind.
I know. Well, you know, it's
just like you, you, you,

1171
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:20,070
you hang out with comics
that you will benefit from

1172
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,010
wheat and you're like, dude, come on.
You will, you'll like this. Chill out.

1173
01:02:23,011 --> 01:02:27,030
You need to take it. I'm going to push
us. So anyways, he fills the bong up,

1174
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:31,770
fucking coughs a long out fucking
crazy stone. And then he goes,

1175
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,650
oh, you're gonna need to tell people
why that makes you crazy stones. Uh,

1176
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,920
because it opens up your,
supposedly when you cough,

1177
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:42,460
it opens up the air or in
the blood vessels in your
lungs that makes more THC go

1178
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:43,990
into your grinding.

1179
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,090
The marijuana to put it inside of
the label was your fancy grinders.

1180
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,880
You cough when you cough, you get
off. Where's your fancy grinder, Joe?

1181
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:55,290
Where's that tee shirt? Uh, so anyways,
but what's crazy is after he did all this,

1182
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:57,540
I thought he was hanging out
for a while. He goes, damn,

1183
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,340
I'm away for my audition
or something like that.

1184
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,280
I got a jet and I lived in Calabasas
and he was going to Hollywood,

1185
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:06,630
which is like a good 30 minutes away.
And so I supposedly, he was so stoned,

1186
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:09,090
he was driving like so
slow on the highway.

1187
01:03:09,091 --> 01:03:13,050
He was sitting at green light's not
knowing to go. He was fucked up.

1188
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:15,690
That's why like most times when you
talk to people, like, yeah, I got,

1189
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,660
I got high once. It really didn't feel
that because you're always really light.

1190
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,510
Oh, just a little hit. Just a little
hit. Make them go for it. Yeah.

1191
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:25,630
Now he's smokes 80 times more than me.
You know,

1192
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,980
like I'm one of those guys that I'll take
a good one or two hits here and there

1193
01:03:28,981 --> 01:03:32,130
during the day when I'm
working or doing something. Uh,

1194
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:36,360
but he's one of those guys that just
wakes up and smokes and eats and just

1195
01:03:36,361 --> 01:03:39,110
everything we'd nonstop
now he loves the weed.

1196
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:43,250
I just can't I I get
paranoid a little bit. Yeah.

1197
01:03:43,370 --> 01:03:44,870
Well you should be paranoid,
bitch.

1198
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:49,370
I stopped and I haven't been
getting paranoid anymore.

1199
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:54,070
I don't know if that's just over.
It's called not.

1200
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:59,040
Yeah, so tomorrow night's naughty
should every night about. Dude,

1201
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:02,690
if you've never seen it before,
it's not just a comedy show.

1202
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,720
It's a comedy show with a
bunch of sketches and all
kinds of other crazy shit.

1203
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,870
You still tossing my fucking my boy.
Brian is Exxon stage.

1204
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,060
She hasn't done, she hasn't been
thought she did a something in Vegas.

1205
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:18,770
He's bang more girls in my show than I
have. I've banked none. He's bankable.

1206
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,790
That's good for you.

1207
01:04:19,791 --> 01:04:22,460
That shows your character and
your dedication to a fine show.

1208
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,600
Someone needs to pick this fucking show
up. Vegas people, you people at the palms,

1209
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:29,570
you want it. You want to show, look at
a brain picker. Land over at hard rock.

1210
01:04:29,571 --> 01:04:32,360
You people to hard rock. Fuck the
palms. I wouldn't say fuck the pumps.

1211
01:04:32,361 --> 01:04:34,830
I love the poms. Poms is
cool man. It's cool too.

1212
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,350
Why do you want to do the
hardrock and other pumps?

1213
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:40,430
Because courts at the palms and that's
his house and he's my friend and I would

1214
01:04:40,431 --> 01:04:42,440
never do anything wrong to have a way.
What the fuck?

1215
01:04:42,441 --> 01:04:44,810
That's more of a party anyway. You
remember that? Used to have that.

1216
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:48,260
Have you been by the cosmetology
cosmopolitan? Is that what's causing that?

1217
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,150
It's the new hotel dude. It is nuts.

It seders very dangerous.

1226
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:29,630
Anderson Silva is going to be a good fight
to Anderson Silva versus [inaudible].

1227
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:33,940
But he changed like training. Pardon?
Uh, training. Uh, Anderson did? No.

1228
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:38,890
A Belford I read changes. A training
manager? No, no, no, no, no. He just,

1229
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:43,690
he had, Sean Tompkins was
one of his striking coaches
and he worked with him for,

1230
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:44,650
he's been working on for a while.

1231
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:47,230
He stopped going with him and
he's working with Ray Sefo now.

1232
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:51,130
That shit to race sophos a US
a bad motherfucker. I'm sure.

1233
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:53,260
I just get worried when he
started changing trainers.

1234
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,950
Raped beef like a week before the
fight. That's kind of weird. Or not.

1235
01:05:55,951 --> 01:05:59,770
How many weeks has been, I dunno,
I'm excited for that fight.

1236
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:01,300
I like both those guys man.

1237
01:06:01,301 --> 01:06:05,260
And they're both those guys that get in
the octagon and have that like that like

1238
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:09,040
worldclass scare you like factor,
you know, you're like, oh man,

1239
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:12,850
look who's across the way. He talks so
fast, man. He, he could catch anybody,

1240
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:16,950
you know, but Anderson so smart and so
technical, you know, it's like, you know,

1241
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,651
a lot of people are saying,

1242
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:20,800
well Anderson had a problem with
shell son and stand up. Totally true.

1243
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:22,840
But I don't think he
was anticipated as much.

1244
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,440
I think he was anticipating child to
try to take him down. Whereas with Vito,

1245
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,570
he's definitely going to be
thinking about vittores standup.

1246
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:32,620
It's a very interesting fight.
I can't wait man. I can't wait.

1247
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:36,340
It's like finally selling is not
intimidated. They're both intimidators.

1248
01:06:36,341 --> 01:06:39,200
I think that's a big thing and it sees,

1249
01:06:39,201 --> 01:06:43,020
I mean to be that successful in
the octagon is crazy for that long.

1250
01:06:43,021 --> 01:06:47,790
Since 2006 you're going to have to do your
own UFC drunk crass at night. Ah, yeah.

1251
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:51,540
Brian's going to be there live you guys,
by the way.

1252
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:55,690
The nightly show podcast number two is
now up on iTunes. Thank you. I'm good.

1253
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,250
Good, good. Maybe just take
one hit. Donk can trust him.

1254
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:06,360
That was a fake hit like a girl.
That was it.

1255
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,970
But now he's like, girl, what
a girl is known for fake kits.

1256
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,010
What about that even mean?
I don't even know.

1257
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:19,290
So I was reading online and some people
were upset at you because of that.

1258
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:21,930
You got to kick out of a girl calling
you a nigger. Can you believe that?

1259
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:26,500
They're mad at me.
Why did they think it's racist?

1260
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,320
They don't understand context and they
don't understand that you have opened

1261
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:32,140
yourself up and you're communicating
with all these folks online.

1262
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,790
Honestly as if they were friends.

1263
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:38,230
We see we are all friends here and we've
been friends for many years and you're

1264
01:07:38,231 --> 01:07:41,800
treating us and you're treating these
people online the same as the same as you

1265
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:43,810
trying to free them. That's
what I'm doing. I'm like,

1266
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,710
cause I feel like sex is like the
thing that defines you the most.

1267
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:52,090
And sometimes if you're in a weird shit
you like hide it and that's how you know,

1268
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,900
you end up hanging yourself in a fucking
closet. You know what I'm saying?

1269
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,970
Jerking off.
Well people think to something,

1270
01:07:57,971 --> 01:08:00,070
there's something wrong with you
because you liked that and that's,

1271
01:08:00,071 --> 01:08:03,730
that's a strange thing, man, that did.
Someone would judge you for liking that.

1272
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,010
I don't care man. You know, not saying
not a racist at all. I mean I'm not,

1273
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:07,630
I love people.

1274
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:12,630
I've known Sam for more than a decade
and he's never showed any prejudice

1275
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:16,060
towards anything. I love that.
Or women or gays or you know

1276
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,650
everybody on an individual
basis. Absolutely. You.

1277
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,300
You are 100% across the board like that,

1278
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:24,590
but you know there's something about
you that likes naughty shit. Yeah,

1279
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:26,860
I mean that's why you have this show
called the naughty show them a little

1280
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,540
messed up. If you're banging a
chicken, she's calling you a nigger.

1281
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:34,340
It's like there's something about that.
It's like dude, you know what I'm saying?

1282
01:08:34,341 --> 01:08:37,010
Cause it's like tab boo man.
That's what everybody liked.

1283
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,190
People on liars such fucking knuckleheads.

1284
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,680
If for whatever reason they're turned
off by this late don't understood way to

1285
01:08:42,681 --> 01:08:45,650
alienate a crowd, you know good
way to alienate your audience.

1286
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:47,930
Like what are you saying by being honest,

1287
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:49,970
he's not calling people
niggers in matter of fact,

1288
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:53,050
he's not even calling the girl that
he's banging. Yeah, I'm getting called.

1289
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,300
He's getting called it dude. Have you ever
been called the n word by a black guy?

1290
01:08:56,301 --> 01:09:00,670
It's the greatest feeling ever.
I loved that.

1291
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,420
He goes all use use it. You Ain't white
homie use Armenian. You's a Nigga.

1292
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:08,150
I was like oh those you're
going to find out someday Homie,

1293
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,710
you Nigga Yo Nigga Yo Nigga would
whiter skin. Okay. Yo Nigga,

1294
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:17,180
it's just so interesting. Like
racism used to be Joe. Ah,

1295
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:21,470
you can't go here. You can't do this.
You can't date them. You can't work here.

1296
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,270
You can't eat here right now.
It's like,

1297
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:27,020
could you don't agree with the context
of the joke? It's a racist joke. It's,

1298
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:29,330
there's nothing race.
Nobody's being held back.

1299
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,760
No one's being forced into something.
It's true.

1300
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:36,710
It's the slippery slope because for
awhile there you couldn't question it.

1301
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:40,320
It's so good. You're racist. You're like,
okay, hey dude, dude, let's not get crazy.

1302
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:45,320
It's like 1989 slash 90 week
girls will say, you hate
women. Yeah. You know, if you,

1303
01:09:45,321 --> 01:09:48,740
if you think there are cons like you hate
women, Brian posted is the best line.

1304
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:51,680
He goes, cause a girl actually said
that to him. He goes, yeah, you know,

1305
01:09:51,681 --> 01:09:55,160
here's a funny thing. Every girl
had said that to me. I hate. Yeah,

1306
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,080
that's a great line.

1307
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:01,600
It's a great line like the idea that
you stand for everyone with a vagina.

1308
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,520
That's completely ridiculous because
we're in an argument and I disagree with

1309
01:10:04,521 --> 01:10:08,150
you. All of a sudden I have issues with
all women now that's like a, a weakening,

1310
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:12,070
it's a trick that they use on you to like
to try to get you to submit and it's,

1311
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,630
it's about trying to stop the conversation
because they have no more get the

1312
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:18,590
label. You're a racist.
That's what racism used to be.

1313
01:10:18,591 --> 01:10:22,160
If I called you racist like 10 years
ago, that was the death blow. Hey,

1314
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:26,530
settle down Bob. No, Hey, that's how
long, just gender, race all like, c'mon,

1315
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,470
let's not get crazy. It's like, Whoa,
you're getting good. Putting a labels.

1316
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,740
It's a funny thing man. I, you know, I
have joke about it like that. You know,

1317
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,930
I never said the word nigger unless
I'm on stage or unless I know for sure

1318
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:39,530
there's no white people around, but I
don't, I don't say it like, like, hey,

1319
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:42,440
there's a bunch of niggers.
I say it like your friend walks up,

1320
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:45,440
there's no white people. Be like, what's
up? Yeah. You give each other a pound.

1321
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:50,500
And it's also so interesting how the rule
applies to like who to applies to who

1322
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:54,170
doesn't apply to like I've heard comedians
all the time yet saying the n word on

1323
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:55,450
stage.
No,

1324
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,780
I've heard white guy saying
only if they're using it
in like saying that someone

1325
01:10:59,781 --> 01:11:03,470
said it. Like I saw Norton this weekend
and he was doing a bit on Mel Gibson.

1326
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:07,730
Hilarious. By the way. Jim
Norton was fucking, he's very
fun. He was hilarious dude.

1327
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,370
I laughed hard. It was the first
time that I had got the scene,

1328
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:13,140
like a guide do like a real
headline set in a long time. Anyway,

1329
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,010
he was doing a thing about

1330
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,230
Mel Gibson where he was, you
know, saying the word, you know,

1331
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:20,610
like Meg's Mel Gibson say I hope
you get raped by a pack of niggers.

1332
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,470
And you know, it was, it was really funny,

1333
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:26,370
but he had to say that word because it
was in that contract he was in. This is,

1334
01:11:26,371 --> 01:11:29,580
he's repeating what Mel gives said.
So if he said the n word,

1335
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:32,820
it would have sounded awkward,
you know. So Mel Gibson said,

1336
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:35,860
I hope you get attacked
by a pack of Edwards. No.

1337
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:38,880
[inaudible] just going to repeat what
he said. Right. You have to say it.

1338
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:41,850
I always felt Mel Gibson wasn't,
it didn't mean it in a racist kind of way.

1339
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:45,240
He just meant he's in a interracial
Gangbang porn and he just want to see his

1340
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:49,110
girl get gang by black guys. He's
an asshole. No, he is an asshole.

1341
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,310
He is an ass and I'm calling, you know,
it's a different, when I was at and I got,

1342
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,260
people gave me shit about that joke,

1343
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:58,500
like about even saying it in that joke
in saying that I would call my friend and

1344
01:11:58,501 --> 01:12:02,280
Nigger, but I would say that I would
never do it. There's black people around.

1345
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:04,290
Like I don't want black
people to get offended.

1346
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,630
I don't want anybody's feelings to
be hurt by the words that I say,

1347
01:12:06,631 --> 01:12:11,240
but what's so what's so?
Isn't it supposed to be all about intense?

1348
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,180
I don't get why people want to keep
taking things away. I understand.

1349
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,770
Why hates we have jobs bro.

1350
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:19,980
And they have to work and when people
have to work and you're in that sort of

1351
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:24,390
environment where everybody's like super
proper and you can't say certain things

1352
01:12:24,391 --> 01:12:26,220
and they want to keep
taking more things away,

1353
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,160
you know it's like it used to be
able to call retards in the office.

1354
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:30,900
I'm sure you spell,
it'd be if you work,

1355
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,600
if you're like a boss and you have a
bunch of employees and you start throwing

1356
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:36,600
around the word retard and
this fucking dope, you know,

1357
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:40,710
you start talking like that or you can
get sued. Yeah, 100% sue you and they'll,

1358
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:41,550
they'll like, you know, you,

1359
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:45,240
you'll have to like pay out your employees
because you're subjecting them to

1360
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:48,330
like Erin stand that.
But like in terms of art,

1361
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:53,040
like art is meant to stimulate, whether
it's positive or negative. It's you.

1362
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:56,970
Is that true though? I mean, yeah, this
is expression, right? It's expression.

1363
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,290
It's an expression.

1364
01:12:58,291 --> 01:13:01,200
And if someone would like violently
disagrees with your expression,

1365
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,530
they violently violently disagree with
the thought behind it. So it feels like,

1366
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,131
you know,

1367
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:09,630
if you have a racist bit and it's clearly
a real racist bit and even though you

1368
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,000
think it's really funny and a lot of
racist people think it's really funny.

1369
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:15,810
For some people it'll be like, whoa,
Whoa, Whoa, like this is a bad expression.

1370
01:13:15,811 --> 01:13:18,360
I want to stop this right where it is.
Right. I see what you're doing here.

1371
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:22,020
I totally agree with that. But I
mean personally meant I love America.

1372
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:26,280
I love like the southern cal is the
greatest thing because there's so much

1373
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:28,860
diversity here. There's lot more
else should go. There's nothing,

1374
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,400
and I know there's like part of England
and France and Germany are very diverse,

1375
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:36,360
but no one has the Latin American like
population that we have and it's like

1376
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:38,430
that's what makes America amazing.

1377
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:41,540
And then you go to somewhere like
Canada where it's all white people.

1378
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,590
It's like just a weird kind of like,

1379
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:47,310
but they're also super fun and friendly
and know they are, they are crime.

1380
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,770
They are like, you know,
it's like what do you want?

1381
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,660
You want all the flavor and the crime
or do you want like less flavor?

1382
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:53,770
Nice people? It's a tricky
thing. I mean a lot of,

1383
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:57,180
that's why a lot of people have moved to
Colorado after they live in California

1384
01:13:57,181 --> 01:13:59,670
as well. One of the reasons why I did it
was like people are different. They're,

1385
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:01,050
they're a little more relaxed,

1386
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:04,250
there's less crime is less bullshit
as well as angst. You know,

1387
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,720
I liked the diversity. I
like it too, but I don't,

1388
01:14:06,721 --> 01:14:09,660
I don't like all the goddamn traffic.
And now that is one thing.

1389
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,850
But I like diversity.
I like different,

1390
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,190
I like how everybody's different.

1391
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:19,360
So used to it now. Like I, at
first it was kind of scary I guess.

1392
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,240
Cause I mean it really
is like where I live,

1393
01:14:22,241 --> 01:14:27,190
I'm one white person on a block almost,
you know, just everywhere I look it's,

1394
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:30,550
you know, not white people. So
at first it was kind of scary,

1395
01:14:30,551 --> 01:14:34,310
but now it's like if you feel used to
it almost like it feels like, oh no, no,

1396
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,380
I'm kind of Mexican.

1397
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,380
Oh he's great.
You can get in with it.

1398
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:41,480
Like a Armenian taxi driver take you
to a hip hop club to dance to hip hop,

1399
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:44,670
stop the diversity. That's the
problem. It's the overpopulation.

1400
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:47,130
It's too many people.
And when you have too many people,

1401
01:14:47,131 --> 01:14:49,800
for sure there's going to be a bunch
of crime. It's just the way it is.

1402
01:14:49,801 --> 01:14:53,220
So there's only so many resources and
some people got to take resources that

1403
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:56,250
aren't readily available. Well there's
that. Yeah. And then there's also just,

1404
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:59,040
this is all going to be in more bad apples
cause there's more humans. You know,

1405
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,400
if one person out of a million is doing
fucked up shit that's gonna make the

1406
01:15:02,401 --> 01:15:06,900
news. And there was no one I haven't heard
anymore. If you make it to the party,

1407
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:08,730
you can stay at the party.
You know what I'm saying?

1408
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,430
You can't fix them and you can't kill him.
So what do you got to do?

1409
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:15,480
You've got to lock them in boxes.
I also think that, you know,

1410
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:18,210
I mean in terms of racism,
I think there's something about,

1411
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:22,980
and you seen in la La is like people
like to believe there's some shadow group

1412
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:26,820
out there holding them down. You
know, and that's across the board.

1413
01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:30,930
Like there's some people who like to
act like it's 1950s and like they're

1414
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:32,910
oppressed.
And I'm not saying one certain group,

1415
01:15:32,911 --> 01:15:37,260
but you see certain people saying that
like female comics make me laugh because

1416
01:15:37,261 --> 01:15:39,990
they're always talking about how
hard is it to be a female comic.

1417
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:40,980
But usually they're,

1418
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,680
what they're bitching about is the
same thing male comics have to do.

1419
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:46,650
I think it's harder to be a chick
man. I think it is to, I don't,

1420
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:50,370
I think you move very quickly. I
think, I think there used to be,

1421
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:53,790
but now you see these girls who are,
who are hitting quicker and they're,

1422
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:57,630
they're learning comedy on the fly.
If they kind of a ratio,

1423
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,440
it gets success before they get success
in signed up. They get TV success. Yeah.

1424
01:16:01,441 --> 01:16:04,290
They get everything. So the alert
they're making, they're having a career,

1425
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:08,170
why they're learning. So I think
like it's in that sense it's, I,

1426
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:10,950
I think if you show a
little bit of like skill,

1427
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:13,140
you get moved up quicker in my opinion.

1428
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,080
Well I think they're looking for
funny checks because they're so rare.

1429
01:16:16,081 --> 01:16:17,250
So when you see one,

1430
01:16:17,251 --> 01:16:20,880
they're so rare that that's why you think
that they get moved up quicker because

1431
01:16:20,881 --> 01:16:24,360
there's guys that are getting moved up
at the same rate, but there's more guys.

1432
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:28,950
So it's like, you know, it's, it's, it's,
it's harder for each individual guy,

1433
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:32,130
but for, I think it's the same amount
of chicks get success as gods and it's,

1434
01:16:32,131 --> 01:16:34,650
I think it's harder.
I think their subject matters limited.

1435
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,240
They can't talk anything about politics.

1436
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:37,810
I don't wanna hear politics
out of some chick's mouth.

1437
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,140
The fuck you to be running
this country. Ochre, you know,

1438
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:44,040
guys will hear a woman talk about politics
and instinctually want to think the

1439
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:44,551
opposite.

1440
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:47,910
They want to like calm cause they're
trying to combat this woman from taking

1441
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:52,530
over. Like it's like natural tribal monkey
instincts that you have to suppress in

1442
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:53,760
order to let a woman talk.

1443
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,270
So you've got this woman who's
talking and she's on an onstage,

1444
01:16:56,310 --> 01:17:00,030
in front of a crowd with a microphone
and a spotlight and you're a man,

1445
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,100
you're a man and she's
commanded the attention.

1446
01:17:02,101 --> 01:17:03,930
Well just your caveman instincts are like,

1447
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:06,930
there's something wrong with this dynamic.
I don't know man.

1448
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:11,030
I just like some like a Lisa Lampanelli
feel that she's able to say things

1449
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:14,220
because of how she looks and who
she is and she's, no Diaz isn't.

1450
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:19,520
It's the same thing man. People suddenly
people can rock it harder. You know why?

1451
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:20,690
Because they're ugly.
Right?

1452
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:23,840
Or there's something that's a weapon when
you're a comic being ugly and fat and

1453
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:24,890
fucked up is a weapon.

1454
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:28,040
You know you use that shit like this
motherfucker's funny already. Why?

1455
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:30,680
Because in real life we've
come to associate ugly fat,

1456
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:33,470
fucked up people with the guys
who were the most reckless.

1457
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,600
They say the craziest shit. They're the
ones who get hammered probably fine.

1458
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,140
Right?

1459
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:39,950
Probably not develop a good personality
cause chicks worn into him cause he had

1460
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,280
a gut. You know those guys are,
a lot of times they have them.

1461
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:44,990
More comedy comes from because
it's a defense mechanism.

1462
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:47,570
But for what I'm saying is for a
woman who's a normal looking woman,

1463
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,910
you're a normal looking man, you
know, a normal looking woman.

1464
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:53,550
I think it's harder for her than it is
for you to go onstage and to, I don't,

1465
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,510
I think it's harder for them. I think
their subject matters more limited,

1466
01:17:56,511 --> 01:17:58,460
especially if it's a regular looking girl.

1467
01:17:58,610 --> 01:18:01,340
Like there's a lot more dirty
girl comics now that are good.

1468
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,600
I think because of Sarah Silverman,
like they saw that she had,

1469
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,590
she was successful and then there's
a lot of pervert chicks out there,

1470
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,430
but they were like holding
that back. Right. You know?

1471
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:12,230
And so now I think they recognize
that that's a viable option and people

1472
01:18:12,231 --> 01:18:13,130
actually like it.

1473
01:18:13,131 --> 01:18:16,820
They like that kind of common for
funerals except that cause it's paradigms.

1474
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,720
That's my opinion. But it'd be like it
dirty. They're like, Oh man, you know,

1475
01:18:20,721 --> 01:18:25,200
all great frat boy comedy. If a girl gets
dirty, it girls are almost like, yeah,

1476
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:29,060
you're representing us because if it's
not dumb. I think Sarah was the first.

1477
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:33,470
Sarah. Sylvan was the first like
really good female. Very, very funny.

1478
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,500
She's really, rivers was
phenomenal. She was good. I mean,

1479
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:39,770
when she was not dirty like Sarah
Silverman though. Sarah Silvermans brutal.

1480
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:42,070
I mean, maybe Joan Rivers
is Saucy, you know?

1481
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,470
But Sarah Silverman tags love taking
shits and elevators and then she's fucking

1482
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:49,370
funny man. And then leave rock. Nellie
came through and she's really dirty too.

1483
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,800
Yeah, there's, there's,
there's many more of those now,

1484
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,140
but I think Sarah was like the
first one that was like really good.

1485
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:58,050
Chandler does Chelsea, she's,
she's a party girl. You know,

1486
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:01,280
she's like more acceptable. Yeah.
That's all I'm trying to say.

1487
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:04,880
I'm just saying it's still harder for
the chick, man. It's harder to beat.

1488
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:09,820
You're more nervous. You have no physical
confidence. Here's another thing, man. I,

1489
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:10,663
you know,
it's like,

1490
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:15,380
and then recently it was a leaving the
Improv and I saw this female comic who

1491
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:19,460
used to just get blackout crazy
drunk at the comedy store.

1492
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:22,760
I remember name by used to watch it
go and that girl is a train wreck.

1493
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,660
I walked by, I see her, she's like, hey.
I'm like, Hey, what's up? She's like,

1494
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,610
got married and then he's
driving this fat Lexus Suv,

1495
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:36,680
so I always feel like as a female comic
you have an out, you have a backup plan,

1496
01:19:36,681 --> 01:19:38,900
my backup plan file,
make case valley on me.

1497
01:19:38,901 --> 01:19:42,860
You can't find some gay guy and
suck his dick. You know? Listen Bro,

1498
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:46,460
you could find some sugar mama if she's
got some ugly dude that she's banging,

1499
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:49,880
you can find some ugly chick divorced
if you really want to do that,

1500
01:19:49,881 --> 01:19:50,511
you could do that,

1501
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:53,660
but how many girls want to be under
the control of some math for money?

1502
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:55,810
You're saying that that it's
like a viable option that would,

1503
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,880
well if you're going to drop the standards
that low and assume that women will

1504
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,980
do that and get married
to some do just for money,

1505
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:04,250
like all of them have that in the bag,
like as an escape clause.

1506
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,990
You could say that for
Youtube because you're,

1507
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:08,270
you're making an assumption chick's
you'd be willing to do that.

1508
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,780
They would all be willing to do that.
No,

1509
01:20:09,781 --> 01:20:13,380
that's not what I'm not saying all of
them. I'm saying that is a, is an option,

1510
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,300
but it's not for an option
for all of them. First of all,

1511
01:20:15,301 --> 01:20:16,860
it's not an option because
they don't want that.

1512
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:19,110
They don't want some dude that they're
not in love with the just there with the

1513
01:20:19,111 --> 01:20:21,090
money, you know? So a lot of them,

1514
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:25,410
there's no option you're assuming
high right now. I can't remember.

1515
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,270
I had a rebuttal to that, but I just,
I just, I think it triggered on every,

1516
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:34,160
my point being everybody has
the same kind of like, uh,

1517
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:38,280
problems in comedy is just
a hard business. You know
what I'm saying? It's easy,

1518
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:42,330
it's hard, but like the actual business
is not the easiest thing in the world.

1519
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,370
I think that applies to everybody.

1520
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:48,150
And sometimes people want to make it
up like they have a harder time than

1521
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:49,740
everybody else.
Do you know what I'm saying?

1522
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,050
I agree with you 100%
people definitely do that.

1523
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:55,860
And then when I see like some 20 year
old kid on Youtube bitching about racism,

1524
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:59,700
I'm like, you're late. It's a different
time. People are getting along better.

1525
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:03,720
Everyone's boning, you know, it's also,
but it's in his, it's in his perspective,

1526
01:21:03,721 --> 01:21:06,660
he still sees an injustice and
even though it's like you're like,

1527
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,930
well it's not the 1950s where they
can't use the same water fountain.

1528
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:13,380
So there's no injustice, like lighten
the fuck up. But he still sees something.

1529
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:14,580
They're still saying,

1530
01:21:14,581 --> 01:21:17,310
it's like everyone believes is
this person holding them down.

1531
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,170
That is a problem man.

1532
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:23,160
The self defeating sort of a attitude
that some people have that it's like,

1533
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:25,830
you know, hey man, it's so stacked
against me. You know, there's,

1534
01:21:25,831 --> 01:21:30,831
there's some guys that the world is
always fucking stack 100% 100% Nick Depalo

1535
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:35,130
love him to death. One of the funniest
fucking guys out there. But I got nick,

1536
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:39,840
he played the part of my brother on
Newsradio and nick is just always used to

1537
01:21:39,841 --> 01:21:42,270
everybody being a cunt
had he's fucking quiz.

1538
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:45,240
He's fucking Cock sock has
these motherfuckers fucking
with me. He's always,

1539
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,340
you know, he's always like,
someone's always an asshole.

1540
01:21:47,341 --> 01:21:49,980
This guy's a Douche bag and
this, you know, whatever.

1541
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:54,000
So it's like Nick Dipaolo is like
always get this negative vibe. So he,

1542
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:55,410
worst case scenario,

1543
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:59,520
that casting lady was a poon
hound or a male version,

1544
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:02,310
the female version of a male
Poon Hound love dudes. Right.

1545
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,110
And now I'm not saying she
did anything with these dudes,

1546
01:22:04,111 --> 01:22:07,170
but she loved to have them as friends.
She was, it was so big for her.

1547
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,003
She loved it.

1548
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,490
And she had all these guy buddy friends
that she'd hooked him up with parts and

1549
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:14,310
sometimes they weren't very fucking good.
They weren't good actors,

1550
01:22:14,311 --> 01:22:18,150
but they were pals with her. So they
got cast for these roles. Well, when we,

1551
01:22:18,151 --> 01:22:21,070
when we wrote this script,
you know, there was two,

1552
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,270
I had three brothers and two brothers
were going to be played by my friends.

1553
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:26,790
Brian Cowen played one
brother and Nick Dipaolo.

1554
01:22:26,791 --> 01:22:30,000
Britt played the other Bri and we had
already worked it out with the producers

1555
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:32,580
and this is exactly what we wanted.
They knew these guys,

1556
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:36,570
the guys had come in like they, they knew
they'd been familiar with their work.

1557
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:38,250
Like this is perfect.
This, it'd be really funny.

1558
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:42,630
Well that my friend goes in to meet the
casting lady and it's supposed to be

1559
01:22:42,631 --> 01:22:47,280
like prearranged and she decides that
she's going to put like some other

1560
01:22:47,281 --> 01:22:50,340
boyfriend of hers in. So
she, she cuts him off,

1561
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:53,700
she cuts to Paulo off and he like
does something with the paperwork.

1562
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:55,800
I don't know what the fuck she did.
I know how she finagled it,

1563
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,710
but all of a sudden she made it as look
as if he couldn't do it and this guy's

1564
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:02,400
doing it. So I called nick up and I
go, what happened? He goes, I don't,

1565
01:23:02,401 --> 01:23:05,620
what the fuck happened? You know, I went
down there, I talked to the guy. So I go,

1566
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:06,220
hold on a second,

1567
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,140
I'm going to fix it. I'll call you
right back. So we had to tell the girl,

1568
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:10,390
now this,
this part was already given to this guy.

1569
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:14,470
And so nick couldn't believe it
when he came back on the set,

1570
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:17,840
when he was on the side. He's
like, it's real. I'm really sorry.

1571
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:21,250
Just waiting for someone to fuck it up
and boom, somebody fucked it up for him.

1572
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,340
You know,
it's a self fulfilling prophecies man.

1573
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:26,350
That goes back to what you were
saying that he's really negative.

1574
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:29,860
But I mean for me it was really funny
that it just like, he's always that way.

1575
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:33,370
He's always negative but that's why it's
fucking comedy. So funny. Very funny.

1576
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:37,360
I worked with them at the Riviera Oh
many years ago. It was a lot of fun.

1577
01:23:37,361 --> 01:23:40,000
He's very nice guy.
Did to Nick Dipaolo is a killer.

1578
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:42,490
When I saw him back in Boston,
he was like, he was like,

1579
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,860
I was an open mic or I was just
starting out and he was like,

1580
01:23:44,861 --> 01:23:47,260
oh a real pro by then
like maybe two years in.

1581
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:50,350
So he was like doing a lot of road
gigs, middling for people, you know,

1582
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:54,100
he was like super active and I remember
watching him on stage once it stitches

1583
01:23:54,101 --> 01:23:58,240
just fucking light the place up for
20 minutes. And I was like, wow,

1584
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:00,910
like can I do that someday?
You know?

1585
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:05,770
It's like some of my favorite jokes
are so vicious. Vicious was material.

1586
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,860
Matt,
his son about AIDS awareness thing.

1587
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:10,420
Who does Nobel aid dogs
fuck with condoms now.

1588
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:17,290
He's so funny. It sounds totally
like at Nick Depaulo lies so funny,

1589
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,124
man.

1590
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:22,300
Fucking that's that watching that whole
casting agent thing was so fascinating,

1591
01:24:22,301 --> 01:24:25,840
man.
This woman's like the male version of,

1592
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:29,830
you know a guy who uses the casting couch
and if it was a guy that was doing it,

1593
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:30,970
he would be a piece of shit.

1594
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:34,890
If there was a guy that
was a podcast podcast,

1595
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:38,620
here is what the casting couch is like,
you know to some people.

1596
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,350
Okay.
Anyway,

1597
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:45,150
what I was saying was it just
with this woman was the mail,

1598
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,720
but I know it's not,

1599
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:51,400
what I'm saying is it's like a casting
couch is the new version of the Comcast

1600
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,320
casting. Is that your grades? No, no.

1601
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:57,440
I'm not bringing anybody on
this show that my band is.

1602
01:24:58,470 --> 01:25:03,340
He is a little blade. That totally
fucking joking. You're not joking.

1603
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:06,730
There's no one else thought that.
That isn't even in the back of my head,

1604
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:08,410
but your head, it's in
the four now. That's the,

1605
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:09,970
that's the in millions of people's heads.

1606
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,540
You know like you have girls bombing on
you because of this podcast? No, not, no,

1607
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,380
not because of this podcast. I'm saying
podcasting. Podcasting is the new,

1608
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:20,670
the the couch like, hey, you want a
podcast? We can hook you up with a pod.

1609
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:23,860
You're saying this,
you're saying this is ridiculous.

1610
01:25:23,861 --> 01:25:27,690
No one else is saying that too.
This is not like a common theme. No,

1611
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:32,700
that's what I am saying that like the new
version of the casting couch nowadays.

1612
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:38,950
You silly fucking here's why. Because
you're not auditioning people for a part.

1613
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,970
You don't have them come in and maybe
I like you and maybe I like you.

1614
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,610
The reason why these people have like
this, these weird relationships is they,

1615
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:48,460
they, they get the person,
whoever's acting, you know,

1616
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:50,410
whoever wants these parts thinking that,
look,

1617
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,270
there's a thousand people
trying out for this.

1618
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:55,810
Who's going to be my best friend who's
going to be clogged? Yeah, definitely.

1619
01:25:55,811 --> 01:25:59,200
You see it all the time, dude. I've seen
some. They would cast for some things.

1620
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:02,710
You would see a big fucking
line of people and this power,

1621
01:26:02,711 --> 01:26:04,190
this ultimate power over the people

1622
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,320
that come in casting people.

1623
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,850
Some of the fucking creepiest people
have very nice ones. Don't get me wrong,

1624
01:26:10,851 --> 01:26:13,960
I've met a bunch of very, very nice
ones. Some of them, you know, they,

1625
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,640
they don't take advantage of the
power and they're just, you know,

1626
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:18,980
they're just friendly people and they're
just trying to have a good time and

1627
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:21,140
everyone's nice to them because
everybody wants to be on a show.

1628
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,140
So for the most part the job is
pretty positive is, and they look,

1629
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:27,320
they got this guy like the guy who
got me fear factor Jeff, I'm sorry,

1630
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:31,490
I don't remember his name, his last
name. He was a great guy, super,

1631
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:33,890
super friendly guy.
Like no negativity at all.

1632
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:37,940
And he was a casting guy but he was a
guy who genuinely loved productions and

1633
01:26:37,941 --> 01:26:40,970
loved good work and loved like
putting together a TV shows and shit.

1634
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,810
And he had cast a bunch of like really
good shows. So it was a positive,

1635
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:45,830
but a lot of them,
man,

1636
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:50,690
they just fucking feed off that power
corrupts just creepy fucking shitty dumb

1637
01:26:50,691 --> 01:26:51,770
ass opinions.

1638
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:56,771
And I remember being in a fucking a
casting agent room with this chick and she

1639
01:26:58,131 --> 01:27:02,870
was like Chubby and unattractive, but
very confident, which is always odd,

1640
01:27:02,871 --> 01:27:06,110
right? You know, and why wildfire
has the best line. He goes,

1641
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:09,740
never put a fat chicken power because she
has too many axes to grind. It's true.

1642
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,830
It's true.
And so this one,

1643
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,880
she sits down with me and it's
like she sits down and you know,

1644
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:18,620
she's like judging me and
breaking me down. You know,

1645
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:20,200
I'm this young guy and you know,

1646
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,110
she's probably like 40 and
kind of creepy and you know,

1647
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,980
just something predatory about it,
right?

1648
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,240
So she starts talking about where
you're from. And I said, well,

1649
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:30,350
I was born in New Jersey, but I grew
up in Boston. And she goes, well,

1650
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:33,740
I'm from Jersey too. But I
don't tell anybody. I tell
them I'm from New York. I go,

1651
01:27:33,741 --> 01:27:35,960
why would you tell them that
you're from New York? And she goes,

1652
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:39,140
I don't want people knowing I'm from New
Jersey. I go, that's ridiculous. I go,

1653
01:27:39,141 --> 01:27:40,420
so you're telling me that like you,

1654
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,340
you define people by what state
they tell you they're from.

1655
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,840
And she just looks at me and she goes,

1656
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:49,340
would you like to start reading
like right there? And then I'm like,

1657
01:27:49,341 --> 01:27:52,100
what have I done? And then there's
a part in his fucking this,

1658
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:54,950
this audition and it's really
embarrassing audition. Okay.

1659
01:27:55,070 --> 01:27:58,160
Because I have to pretend that this
cow is now my girlfriend, you know,

1660
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:01,520
and that I love her and then I have to
leave her and at one point in time I have

1661
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:06,521
to sing a song to her so I have to sing
this fucking delirious Bruce Springsteen

1662
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:10,880
song. That tape would
be gone. My God to this,

1663
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:15,260
she is looking at me like with a
half an eyebrow raised and like,

1664
01:28:15,261 --> 01:28:17,300
you're wasting your time. I'm never
going to give you this part anyway,

1665
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:19,820
but you have to do it because I told
you to do it. So here's your audition.

1666
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:24,290
Scared Person. Oh, it was death.
It was just a on to your eyes,

1667
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:29,150
dog shit logs coming out of my mouth.
I was trying to get him out.

1668
01:28:29,151 --> 01:28:32,810
It was like I had a hundred logs of dry
dog shit in my mouth. I'm just trying to,

1669
01:28:33,150 --> 01:28:36,140
I got to get them out one at a time or
I can't wait to get them out and then

1670
01:28:36,141 --> 01:28:38,420
finally got it out and I got
to leave and that's hilarious.

1671
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:42,470
Ever heard from my hate auditioning man.
Some of the Times it's, it's brutal.

1672
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:45,980
It's the worst thing about acting. It's
like here, you know we want you to be,

1673
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:49,160
we want to know that you can
pretend to be someone else.

1674
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:50,600
So we're going to give you,
you know,

1675
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:53,270
a totally alien environment
where he's sitting there,

1676
01:28:53,271 --> 01:28:55,550
there's a cam quarter on you assistance,

1677
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,580
everyone's got their arms crossed
and in and you're going to read.

1678
01:28:58,670 --> 01:28:59,420
And one time I was,

1679
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:02,640
I got annoyed once cause I was doing
this audition and I was reading with this

1680
01:29:02,641 --> 01:29:05,910
assistant and this fucking
dude couldn't read man.

1681
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:09,660
It was like you're supposed to be like
reading with them like some like listen

1682
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:13,140
Mike, if we don't get back there by
six o'clock, we've got a real problem.

1683
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,300
You have to be able to at least say
that this guy was like, listen, if

1684
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:22,560
Mike Listen, if you don't get back
there by 10 o'clock we have a real,

1685
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:27,180
I'm not kidding, this guy fucked up every
line. He was like super, super nervous.

1686
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:30,540
He, everything that came out of his
mouth was like a jumble and I'm like,

1687
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:33,150
you shot her and fuck.
This is a movie audition.

1688
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,070
I remember auditioning for this really,
really bad sitcom,

1689
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:41,730
not a sitcom comedy movie and I
didn't want to go on the audition,

1690
01:29:41,731 --> 01:29:44,140
but I was told, I was like, I don't want
to do this movie. If I ever do this move,

1691
01:29:44,141 --> 01:29:47,040
I'll be unhappy in. My agent's
like, listen, sometimes
it's better to get things.

1692
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:49,310
Then you turn them down. Then more
people want to beat when I'm like, oh,

1693
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,660
that doesn't make any sense, but
all right, you got me. I'm there.

1694
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,410
So I go and I auditioned for it
and it's brutal. It's so bad.

1695
01:29:55,530 --> 01:29:59,460
It's like this and I'm supposed to play
this guy who's like really happy about

1696
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,820
being married and I'm trying to
convince my friend that, you know,

1697
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:06,960
you could be married to man, this
a marriage is amazing. It's so bad.

1698
01:30:06,961 --> 01:30:11,250
I have no idea. So anyway, there's this
horrible English director, you know,

1699
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:14,790
he's got this like you're like a really
powerful English accent and he's,

1700
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,820
he wants me to Ad Lib so
I just get done with this,

1701
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,520
these awful awful words.
I mean the,

1702
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:25,410
the dialogue was just wooden and
stupid and he's like, all right,

1703
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:28,740
this is a next thing when I want you to
do is I want you to take this piece of

1704
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:33,600
paper and I want you to write on
shots. Married Joel, very excited.

1705
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,020
You K you're going to let him
know, you know, just married.

1706
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:40,920
And I stopped and I said,
you know what? I go,

1707
01:30:40,921 --> 01:30:44,640
if this guy was an actor and
we run a set and I was already,

1708
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,110
I already had the part,

1709
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,810
I might ad Lib something and I could
probably come up with something.

1710
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:52,470
I'd sit down and you know,
figuring out some good lines for them,

1711
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,330
but this is an audition and this guy's
an assistant and I don't want to do that.

1712
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:00,600
I can't. So I said, I actually
said that like, these are my words.

1713
01:31:00,601 --> 01:31:03,240
I don't want to do that. And
they go, okay, well thank
you. Thank you for coming in.

1714
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,810
Okay. And I leave and my agent
calls me up fucking furious.

1715
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:10,230
What did you say to them?
You know you can't do that.

1716
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,920
You're going to get black balled. You
understand? I go, do I understand? I go,

1717
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:17,250
what did I say? I, I was honest.
I said, this is a, this is bad.

1718
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:21,810
There's a assistant here who can't read
and you want me to Ad Lib to some Shitty

1719
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:26,150
fucking movie. What am I supposed to
do there? But yeah, this, this, this.

1720
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:27,990
I don't think that what I did was rude.

1721
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:30,600
I think I let them know that I didn't
want to do their movie. You have to have,

1722
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:33,830
you did, you got put your foot down once
in a while. This town respects that.

1723
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:37,470
You can't say, come here,
read this for the first town,

1724
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,920
now write your own shit and
put it in there. Well, okay.

1725
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:44,370
Which will probably end up in the
movie though. That's great line Zap.

1726
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,520
Judah did that exam. Judah apparently
was doing this movie with some guy,

1727
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:48,810
and I don't want to say the guy's name,

1728
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:52,440
but it rhymes with Eddie Murphy
and he was uh, he was doing,

1729
01:31:52,670 --> 01:31:57,410
he would say like really funny
lines and then a box and that Zap,

1730
01:31:57,520 --> 01:32:00,130
Zap Judah, Judah, Jesus Christ.

1731
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:04,120
The fuck is wrong with me. Jude
is all together. Yeah. Wow.

1732
01:32:04,121 --> 01:32:07,350
The boxers and a movie. Yeah. Thank
you for noticing that. That shit would,

1733
01:32:07,351 --> 01:32:09,760
it went on the Internet.
Oops. Too late. Anyway,

1734
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:14,950
so is doing this movie and Judah has
all these great ad libs and in the next

1735
01:32:14,951 --> 01:32:19,510
scene, like in the next take, like Eddie
Murphy's got the Ad Libs now of Judas,

1736
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:23,920
Judas, like an unpaid writer.
Like he's writing all these
great line. He'd get out.

1737
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:28,900
Eddie Murphy, just Jackson. That's
horrible. Well, it's like I,

1738
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,630
you know, what can you do? I
totally get what they're doing.

1739
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:34,450
They're trying to find the best person
for the job. I get it, I get it,

1740
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:37,990
but Goddamn, it was dumb. You know
who's on set? That's always cool.

1741
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:42,700
Universally makeup girls, everyone else
that they're always the nicest people.

1742
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:45,520
They always have a cool vibe.
I knew one of those crazy,

1743
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,920
a new one that was completely
insane. So yeah, I met one early on.

1744
01:32:48,921 --> 01:32:52,600
It was just out of her fucking head and
saying was she attractive at all because

1745
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:55,690
she's not attractive to
show them Draco Whoa,

1746
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:59,830
who's this Unicorn you found awfulness
or I don't know. She's a nice person.

1747
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:00,850
It's just a crazy person.

1748
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:03,200
Yeah, I knew one that
was a, that does both.

1749
01:33:03,201 --> 01:33:05,670
Like movies ambitious also does porn sets.

1750
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,720
She lives in a van and it's a
sweet vantage. It's like, you know,

1751
01:33:09,721 --> 01:33:12,270
like you go in and they have
couches and he could smoke weed,

1752
01:33:12,271 --> 01:33:13,630
but I think she lives in it.
What is it

1753
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:16,070
like to go from Columbus,
Ohio,

1754
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,270
like where you grew up and all of a sudden
you're in La and you're like intwined

1755
01:33:20,271 --> 01:33:22,160
in the porn business for
a brief period of time.

1756
01:33:22,161 --> 01:33:24,530
We were like hanging around
with all these people and like,

1757
01:33:24,531 --> 01:33:27,080
are you loved or you like, are they
like, do what's wrong with you?

1758
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:28,940
It's,
it was interesting.

1759
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:33,620
It was interesting seeing what that was
all about very quickly and understanding

1760
01:33:33,621 --> 01:33:37,820
how it works and how, you know, the
whole game of it. That was interesting.

1761
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:41,120
What did you get out of it? Like, you
know, did you, did you get a lot of it,

1762
01:33:41,121 --> 01:33:43,220
like more of an understanding for
those girls who do that? Well,

1763
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:46,430
I think the best thing was is
that you get what I call it.

1764
01:33:46,490 --> 01:33:51,110
I don't know what it'd be like a brother,
no second cousin aids test, which is,

1765
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:52,010
you know,
cause they,

1766
01:33:52,011 --> 01:33:57,011
every time they shoot they get an aids
test and then if they don't have A's and

1767
01:33:57,231 --> 01:33:57,760
you don't have it,

1768
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:58,091
do you know?

1769
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:03,091
So I love [inaudible] so I don't have
any aids tests looking for a pussy.

1770
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:10,470
Just super resistant to it. But your
Dick is just her boss who's like rubber,

1771
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:14,680
but it's better than
the job fuck so much.

1772
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:18,010
The inside of his completely calloused
to the point where nothing can get in.

1773
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:21,320
There's no open skin. But, but
meanwhile it's like this, you know,

1774
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:25,960
this leather pouch that contains
aids loads and you're singing,

1775
01:34:25,990 --> 01:34:27,150
you're sticking your Dick in there.

1776
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,600
Well, I mean most guys,
I don't know about you.

1777
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,330
I never wouldn't hit a bit of Goo nudes,
toast. You know, I never really do

1778
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,520
dude.
I got an ace test when I was,

1779
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:39,620
when I got health insurance when
I was 24 25 and I was terrified.

1780
01:34:39,650 --> 01:34:41,620
Really? Absolutely. Completely hard.

1781
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,020
I was like thinking about all the times
I had sex without condoms and I was like,

1782
01:34:45,021 --> 01:34:48,140
for sure one of those girls has aids
and now I have aids. Like, you know,

1783
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:51,270
I was already 25 and I was stupid.
And you know,

1784
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:54,170
you don't even think about what you're
doing. You're 25 if somebody gives you a,

1785
01:34:54,171 --> 01:34:57,890
you know, an open and you
throw the pitch, boom. No, it's
in the glove. Bam. You know,

1786
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:58,100
it's

1787
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,710
like Peter and even believe she's
letting you fucker in the first place.

1788
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,490
It is truly amazing. You last thing to
do is throw a condom on half the time,

1789
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:04,701
you know,

1790
01:35:04,701 --> 01:35:08,600
it's like you don't wear condoms until
you like have like an a one pregnancy

1791
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:11,120
scare and then you girlfriends like
you got to wear a condom this time.

1792
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:15,110
You're like, okay, I'll wear
a condom anyway. Will we
ever get to the technology?

1793
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:20,060
Condoms feel good. Do you
think? No, I don't think they
can do that. I mean, what a,

1794
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,450
what is it going to be? How's it gonna
feel as good as no sac as good as sex?

1795
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:27,490
Maybe. I mean, who knows, who knows? I
mean, what the fuck do I know? I'm, I,

1796
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:31,700
I can't control what kind of inventions
come out of podcast. Got No power.

1797
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:35,030
I got no power. But um, you
know, so anyway, when I was,

1798
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:38,060
like I said when I was 25 did a lot
of stupid shit or I made a lot of bad

1799
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:41,630
decisions, I wasn't a mature thinking
adult. I was a child living on my own.

1800
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:44,840
So when that aids test came,
I was fucking petrified.

1801
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:46,590
I was positive that I had HIV.

1802
01:35:46,591 --> 01:35:50,690
It was just thinking I'll every dirty
skank than I ever banked all would flash

1803
01:35:50,710 --> 01:35:54,290
back and fall that Emory and I get sick.
That's sick feeling that you get,

1804
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,450
especially when you're,
when you're a kid,

1805
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:59,960
you don't even realize you have to find
out from all your friends being honest

1806
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:00,980
about the same situation,

1807
01:36:00,981 --> 01:36:04,820
but nobody teaches you when
you're a young boy like Sun,

1808
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:08,690
one day you're going to have a hard on
and that hard on is going to betray you.

1809
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:11,180
Okay? I just want to let you know you're
going to fuck a girl that you don't even

1810
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:11,900
like.

1811
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:15,110
You don't want to be around her and
you're going to promise her you love her.

1812
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:16,790
You're going to talk to her.
You mean it.

1813
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,000
You're going to talk to her about having
kids with her just because you want to

1814
01:36:20,001 --> 01:36:24,650
stick your dick inside of her. And as
much as the hard is, you try to do it.

1815
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:29,240
That's the exact opposite, how bad
you're going to feel when it's over.

1816
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:34,430
When you have an orgasm and you
just have that fucking terrible,

1817
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:38,660
horrible feeling of regret.
Eddie Bravo cause it PostNet syndrome.

1818
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:42,800
That's hilarious. The minute leaves to my
friend used to do two crazy wild party.

1819
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:46,550
I used to do a bit about it,
about being stuck on a bus.

1820
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,290
And then it's like when you,
when you have a heart on,

1821
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,620
it feels like your Dick is driving
the bus and you're in the back seat.

1822
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:54,410
You're sitting in the back
side of it, you're watching
life play out. You're like,

1823
01:36:54,411 --> 01:36:56,150
what do you even do in up there?
Do you know where you're going?

1824
01:36:56,270 --> 01:37:00,200
Like you barely driving your life,
but that when, as soon as you orgasm,

1825
01:37:00,201 --> 01:37:01,760
all of a sudden you're
at the front of the bus,

1826
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:04,130
hold onto the wheel and you're like, how
did I get here? What am I doing here?

1827
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:07,730
I don't even know how to get home. Who's
that? Yeah. What the fuck? And you know,

1828
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:11,890
could you just cuddle and be tender
B tender? What are you talking about?

1829
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,430
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.
I got Glen. Yeah. And it's, it's,

1830
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:18,290
you really did mean everything
you said an hour ago.

1831
01:37:18,291 --> 01:37:22,250
You really meant all that shit. It's like,
it's so strange. The difference between,

1832
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:25,700
you know how when you're horny and
when you're trying to have sex,

1833
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:29,270
like how passionate you could be into
someone and then as soon as the orgasm

1834
01:37:29,271 --> 01:37:33,560
goes away, all their qualities that you
found attractive. Now we're annoying.

1835
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:38,330
Did you did simply try to sue the guy
for that, like they lean? Yeah, sure.

1836
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:41,150
Reception or something like she
that you know to get her in bed.

1837
01:37:41,151 --> 01:37:44,690
He said one thing and then afterwards he
was like, it didn't happen. She's like,

1838
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:48,260
that's a breach of contract
almost. Yeah. I would imagine.

1839
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:51,830
I doubted holds up in court though.
Yeah. Anything that you say,

1840
01:37:51,831 --> 01:37:54,720
well you have a hard on, should not hold
up in court. I think that is the ruling.

1841
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,160
This should be ridiculous.

1842
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:00,120
It's like he's in a compromised state
very clearly. Did he have a hard on? Yeah.

1843
01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:01,800
What do you do? What did you expect? Yes.

1844
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,090
You asked him he was willing to marry you.

1845
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:06,630
His Dick was a quarter of an inch from
your wet vagina. It was going to say yes.

1846
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:11,250
Okay, I'll marry you up.
What did I say? Yeah. Ah,

1847
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:12,510
it's really like witchcraft.

1848
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:15,930
No wonder why dudes would be like burn
chicks for witchcraft back in the day.

1849
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,140
They probably really believed that it
was witchcraft. You know that a pump,

1850
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,690
a woman put a spell on you.
Oh, it didn't make sense.

1851
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,340
Like how can I be so enchanted by her?

1852
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,410
She's how rich and then the other fat
chicks in the fucking community come

1853
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:31,100
storming with torches and light that
bitch on fire. Like the, uh, like, uh,

1854
01:38:31,350 --> 01:38:34,830
it's always the fat chick.
Like those two in my stories it is.

1855
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:37,530
Do you know the North
Carolina a football team,

1856
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:42,531
the panthers to their cheerleaders got
busted going at it in a bathroom stall at

1857
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:46,450
a restaurant. Whoa. And then the, uh,

1858
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:50,340
one of the waitresses called the cops and
had them arrested. I'm like, you know,

1859
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:54,510
she's just some Chunky Moomoo that just
fucking was player hating on these two

1860
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:57,730
hotties going out. I don't know,
man. If I was a regular chicken,

1861
01:38:57,731 --> 01:39:02,130
I was working in some skanks. You just
assholes in the fucking both. I might go,

1862
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:02,550
Hey,

1863
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:07,550
get the fuck outta here with your dirty
ass hole table where a French fry could

1864
01:39:07,741 --> 01:39:12,340
fall down a little kink in pick it up
like in the bathroom at a restaurant and

1865
01:39:12,341 --> 01:39:16,840
two guys are having sex and licking
each other's ass holes. Would you go to,

1866
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:21,200
you set a booth. Okay. I said
bathroom. Did I say that?

1867
01:39:21,201 --> 01:39:25,140
I think you said I'm in a bathroom.
Stall. Bathrooms. You confuse the shit.

1868
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:31,170
You confuse the shit out of me. It's just
the wrong word. We got confused. Okay,

1869
01:39:31,171 --> 01:39:33,960
so I, I get your point. Yeah. If
they were banging in the bathroom,

1870
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:34,794
I probably let it go.

1871
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:37,110
If I came in the bathroom and two chicks
are fingering each other, I'd be like,

1872
01:39:37,111 --> 01:39:38,100
oh, whoops. Sorry.

1873
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:41,280
Gotta go and probably just told a
manager and the manager called the cops,

1874
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:44,850
you know, or something like, yeah, she
ratted her in America. They shouldn't,

1875
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:47,280
you shouldn't rat someone out
for eating box in a, in a toilet.

1876
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:49,800
Who's getting hurt there?
Who's the victim?

1877
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:52,500
If you came in and she was giving her
a massage, would you call the police?

1878
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,920
She was like, oh, right there, it
hurts. Oh, that's good. That's good.

1879
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:58,590
And Gel like you were giving
her what she needed physically.

1880
01:39:58,591 --> 01:40:00,720
You given her a physical sensation.
What your fingers.

1881
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:03,930
How's that different from Eaton box in
a toilet stall. And that's my point,

1882
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:07,860
I believe. I bet in Europe it can
fly. And Europe, you're probably,

1883
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:10,760
they have like special seats in there.
If you want to take a shit, sit here.

1884
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:15,360
If you wanna get your Dick sucked set
up here. Hey, they have a porn. Uh,

1885
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:20,130
they have a porn bookstore in a
German airport. Oh really? Yeah.

1886
01:40:20,131 --> 01:40:23,310
They sell porn at airports.
Holy Shit. This A, I forget,

1887
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:25,320
I think it was Iceland or some the,

1888
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:30,350
they have the like a lesbian prime
minister and she outlawed strip bars.

1889
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:35,430
Whoa. Yeah. That's interesting. How
can you outlaw that? How can mean that?

1890
01:40:35,431 --> 01:40:36,840
Seems like that's like communist shit.

1891
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,030
You can't tell because
there have been women look,

1892
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:42,690
a lot of women that get into stripping.
Yes. A lot of them have been molested,

1893
01:40:42,691 --> 01:40:45,870
but there happened women that they just
needed money and this was a way to make

1894
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:48,480
a ton of money and it puts them, they
actually put themselves through school.

1895
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:52,460
I mean, it's the big Cliche, right? You
know, like who had a Mike, Joe, Mike,

1896
01:40:52,461 --> 01:40:54,070
a young a,
a joke about

1897
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:58,300
how do you ever notice that all strippers
are going to college like some year,

1898
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,050
one day? It's kind of, it's like there's
going to be a whole graduating class,

1899
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:06,430
a genius strippers. It was really
funny. He can't chance. Yeah,

1900
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:11,590
exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
There's the jug. I mean, but
they should have that option.

1901
01:41:11,591 --> 01:41:13,930
If you want to stick your ass
on some guy's face and you know,

1902
01:41:13,931 --> 01:41:15,460
and make 1000 bucks a night,

1903
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:18,310
he should be allowed to because
is that less humiliating,

1904
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:22,360
the working at Denny's for 100 bucks a
night? I don't think it is. Oh by the way,

1905
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:23,800
I think if you want to work with fucking,

1906
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:26,350
if you're a hot check and you got a nice
body and you want to work five hours

1907
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:29,280
and you want to stick your, if you're
cool with somebody, we can pussy. Wow.

1908
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,550
I always wanted to be financial consultant
to the strippers because they have so

1909
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:36,040
much money and they do nothing with it.
If you're like,

1910
01:41:36,041 --> 01:41:39,580
let me invest for you silly
so you're not a good investor.

1911
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:43,210
Fuck you talking about. I didn't mix
yourself. Nonsense. He's talking,

1912
01:41:43,620 --> 01:41:44,740
trying to control some strippers.

1913
01:41:44,741 --> 01:41:47,140
Monies is called pimp inside
and I've been there, done that.

1914
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:51,010
I know what you're doing,
but it's like they don't even have cars.

1915
01:41:51,011 --> 01:41:51,850
Half these girls.

1916
01:41:51,851 --> 01:41:55,180
Why not like invested in the stock market
trying to make some money because the

1917
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:57,340
stock market's unpredictable.
They should save some money.

1918
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:00,100
Let's do they should do. Puts
squirrels some away. The problem is,

1919
01:42:00,101 --> 01:42:03,100
you know when all sudden you're making
1000 bucks a night and you're doing a job,

1920
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:05,320
that sucks. If you don't want
to be there all the time,

1921
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:08,530
you know you'll start spending money
just to kind of placate yourself. Right?

1922
01:42:08,531 --> 01:42:12,010
A lot of people that have their boyfriends
spends it on Xbox or some shit like

1923
01:42:12,011 --> 01:42:14,710
that. That's true too. They
support men too. That's the other,

1924
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:18,580
the weirdest relationship with strippers
is a lot of them have like super loser

1925
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:21,130
boyfriends that just cannot get jobs,
you know,

1926
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:23,290
and that's why these guys
are willing to accept it.

1927
01:42:23,291 --> 01:42:27,940
There girl will climb on guys' laps
every night and stick their tits and guys

1928
01:42:27,941 --> 01:42:31,240
like Dan, not into it, man. Most of
them aren't. They're just weak men.

1929
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,890
And this girl needs a man and needs a
man to like be serious with her and live

1930
01:42:35,891 --> 01:42:39,010
with her and,
and still allow her to work this job.

1931
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:42,100
And most guys are not going to
be down with that, but losers,

1932
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:45,730
guys who have like shitty jobs are guys
who are just really lazy and they're,

1933
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:48,490
they don't have a problem with
a girl taking care of them.

1934
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:51,090
They got no problem with that. So
they're like, you know, go ahead,

1935
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:54,060
go ahead and work up. Some guys
are just into that like, yeah,

1936
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:57,250
their whole stock holding thing
and all that. Cuckold Holden. Yeah.

1937
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:00,570
There's a few that are into that, but most
of them are just losers. Most of them.

1938
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,241
That's why you know,

1939
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:05,470
they beat the girl up eventually or get
mad at her or something and you're not

1940
01:43:05,471 --> 01:43:08,260
even in fucking man.
You'd have in a job you fuckin whore.

1941
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:11,330
You know there's always,
always something, you know it's

1942
01:43:12,110 --> 01:43:16,070
be their investor,
aim high,

1943
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,470
go for those strippers. Thousand dollars
a month invested that shit. It's a good,

1944
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:25,640
it's a good move.
I think I liked the way strippers thing.

1945
01:43:25,641 --> 01:43:28,670
Just make a shit load of money and
just spend it on drugs and drinking and

1946
01:43:28,671 --> 01:43:32,480
sheers. You like that and shoot. Is that
what you would do if you're a stripper?

1947
01:43:32,900 --> 01:43:34,770
Probably. You wouldn't be
starting your own business.

1948
01:43:35,090 --> 01:43:38,510
I wouldn't be thinking about
it. I'm fucking working
nights. Single gas station.

1949
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:41,900
I one of the sleeping in strippers
have to sleep in. You know,

1950
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:45,470
you're out till 5:00 AM every
day. Yeah. It's a lot of work.

1951
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:49,730
Best part of the invite the economy being
bad as hot chicks working at Denny's

1952
01:43:49,731 --> 01:43:52,010
now, have you noticed that? Yeah. I was

1953
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,420
in Phoenix and I went to this Denny's
and these chicks were hot. Really?

1954
01:43:56,421 --> 01:44:00,590
Yeah. Wow. I guess he got to take what
you got to take. I think it's awesome.

1955
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:04,220
I chicks and bad situations.
Brother allowed you love. Yeah,

1956
01:44:04,221 --> 01:44:06,680
I do like when you look, just
keep one. Are y'all? Yeah.

1957
01:44:06,681 --> 01:44:10,250
When they're driving like shitty cars.
You like that or riding the bus ls.

1958
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:13,280
You'll drive by. You see like some
hot chicken getting ready for the bus.

1959
01:44:13,281 --> 01:44:16,490
You're like, how easy could it be?
The be the knight in shining armor.

1960
01:44:16,491 --> 01:44:19,910
You know what I'm saying? I got, we'll
get you where you got to go. Yeah, dude,

1961
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:24,470
I love bad situations. Hot chicks
and bad situations. My favorite shit.

1962
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:27,290
There's more of that happening now than
ever before. That's for flux. Sure.

1963
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:30,230
Especially in la where they just
moved there. It's like, yeah.

1964
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:31,320
What happens when you're a chicken?

1965
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:34,510
You've got a sugar daddy and your sugar
daddy goes bankrupt. Oh, that's good.

1966
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:39,200
Imagine that Shit, man. Then also
we've got to get a job. Oh Fuck,

1967
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:43,250
I've been fucking, it's fat cock sucker
for five years. That's my job. You know,

1968
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:46,100
she's like, I gotta join the workforce
now. Or when they do, you know,

1969
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:49,550
you get married then after a couple of
months and get divorced just to get that

1970
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:54,260
cash. Do you think that it's, how
many girls take that path that you do?

1971
01:44:54,261 --> 01:44:57,260
You described earlier about your comedian
friend that all of a sudden she's

1972
01:44:57,261 --> 01:44:59,840
driving a nice car.
How many girls do that?

1973
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:03,050
I think there's a lot and
I don't see it as the,

1974
01:45:03,120 --> 01:45:07,980
I don't think necessarily being
attracted to a guy cause he has wealth is

1975
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:11,840
necessarily a bad thing. Well it
is a, it is a feature, you know,

1976
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:14,720
it's like a big Dick is
going to be nice to me.

1977
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:17,840
You know I liked that big Dick
because he does he have a strong body?

1978
01:45:17,841 --> 01:45:21,230
Strong body can protect me. Is he
handsome? Yeah, I'll find him attractive.

1979
01:45:21,231 --> 01:45:25,310
These are all rewards. What
about the money? He's broke.
Fuck this broke ass. Yeah.

1980
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:30,320
Well that makes sense. That Kanye West
Song. Alright, so and she's a gold digger.

1981
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,440
Look, that's just the way it is, man.
It's like it's, it's a part of nature.

1982
01:45:33,470 --> 01:45:36,980
You know, someone providing
is an attractive feature.
It's all well and good.

1983
01:45:36,981 --> 01:45:38,360
If you work hard and you're not as man,

1984
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:42,590
but if you're still making five bucks an
hour, you might be retarded and retard.

1985
01:45:42,591 --> 01:45:45,160
I don't need your raising my
kids on 20 bucks a week. Okay?

1986
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:48,320
I need to find more money. You fuck.
That's what they're supposed to do. Yeah.

1987
01:45:48,321 --> 01:45:50,150
There's a game going on.
You're playing the game.

1988
01:45:50,151 --> 01:45:53,570
The game's called capitalism and you
don't have any chips. You got no chips.

1989
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:55,580
You're out there. You're, you're
humping just like everybody else.

1990
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:57,290
I know you're being
noble and all that shit,

1991
01:45:57,291 --> 01:46:01,250
but we got to come to a realization that
this world runs on certain principles.

1992
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:05,660
I've got to get that payment.
My baby needs resources.
Got I got that paper. Yeah.

1993
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,250
Babies need resources,
man.

1994
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,710
You can't be running around
with babies with some broke ass.

1995
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:11,690
It's a pain in the ass,
ma'am.

1996
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:17,050
100% as we make this trek into this new
stage of existence where fucking robots

1997
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:19,460
are going to be doing everything
retards are doing now,

1998
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:20,810
it's going to be very strange.

1999
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:24,300
It's going to be just like Iraq war when
the soldiers come home and they were

2000
01:46:24,301 --> 01:46:26,150
like, now what? That's
what's going to happen.

2001
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:28,970
All these retards are going to
get kicked out of, you know, any,

2002
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:32,690
any like mindless job is all going to
be eventually done by robots. Yeah.

2003
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:36,350
Whether they do, what do they do?
Man? Robots don't have to sleep.

2004
01:46:36,351 --> 01:46:39,920
They can work 24 hours a day and once
they can handle delicate measures and do

2005
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:43,490
things and then once it's economically
feasible, which eventually it must be,

2006
01:46:43,491 --> 01:46:46,520
it's like everything becomes cheaper
and faster and easier as time goes on.

2007
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,260
So eventually there's
going to be some sort of,

2008
01:46:48,261 --> 01:46:50,730
robots are going to virtually
everything that people do.

2009
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,150
When you charge people's, you know,
people get paid $7 an hour, any,

2010
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:57,790
any fast food jobs and all that shit's
going to be handled by robots. Yeah,

2011
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:01,500
I fucked some people can't
be doctors or lawyers.

2012
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:04,420
They don't have that meant they're not
built like that. They're more hands on.

2013
01:47:04,421 --> 01:47:08,790
So you know, they're meant
to be like working, you know,
building cars or whatever.

2014
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:11,730
You know, they're more like, well that's
all good shit too. I mean that's not a,

2015
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:14,190
that's not a mindless thing. That's,
I'm not saying that the line was,

2016
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:18,310
I'm saying what I mean is you're
saying a word dumb labor jobs. Yeah.

2017
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:22,750
I was in someone's like written to making
cars and the craftsman stuff sort of

2018
01:47:22,751 --> 01:47:25,140
thing. They could find the other
things. Like people are always,

2019
01:47:25,610 --> 01:47:30,000
our lots are building all the jobs.
Cars are art, you know, like a car,

2020
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:32,610
like a hot rod or something that someone
who fabricates a car. Let me just say,

2021
01:47:32,611 --> 01:47:34,800
I wasn't saying that
that was a mindless job.

2022
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:37,980
I'm saying like these people
aren't built to, because I need,

2023
01:47:37,981 --> 01:47:41,250
I know what you're saying. Eventually
robots are gonna take over those parts.

2024
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:43,620
So where do they go? Because they
can't become doctors. Lawyers.

2025
01:47:43,621 --> 01:47:47,190
Cause that's not really what their,
their wheelhouses I guess.

2026
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:49,290
Do you know what I'm saying? Just have
to figure out something else. You know,

2027
01:47:49,291 --> 01:47:51,980
I mean if you don't have,
if the job doesn't exist anymore,

2028
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:54,720
the universe is not sweating that, all
right, you got to deal with that shit.

2029
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:54,960
Right.

2030
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,050
And if you're smart enough to get to that
point where you're good at one thing,

2031
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:00,420
you're going to have to figure out how to,
you know,

2032
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,120
use what skills you have to
get better at something else.

2033
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:06,270
Because obviously that that part
doesn't exist in society anymore.

2034
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:08,760
You're just going to have to
face up to that adapt or die.

2035
01:48:08,761 --> 01:48:10,300
It's really that simple.
It's like,

2036
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:14,330
well we can't nerf the world for people
that they can't catch up nerf the world.

2037
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:17,010
I like just going to be
some spots where it's rocky.

2038
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,650
There's going to be some spots where
people had banked on something being

2039
01:48:19,651 --> 01:48:22,330
successful forever and then it's not.
And what are we do?

2040
01:48:22,331 --> 01:48:23,850
We're going to keep it alive.
You know,

2041
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:26,310
just for the sake of these folks
now these folks have to fucking,

2042
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,010
they have to figure out what's next for
them because this thing is going to die

2043
01:48:29,011 --> 01:48:31,530
off and then a new thing. It's got to
come. Right. I totally agree with that.

2044
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:36,000
Do you ever wonder or worry that there's
going to get to a point where there's

2045
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:41,100
all these people out there with no
place? Yeah, so I'm saying like we're,

2046
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:43,380
you know, it's like we keep
talking about creating jobs.

2047
01:48:43,381 --> 01:48:45,360
I mean like they're all fucking,
and they're all making babies.

2048
01:48:45,390 --> 01:48:47,370
Look at redbox and blockbuster video.

2049
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:49,560
There's no need to have
blockbuster videos anymore.

2050
01:48:49,561 --> 01:48:52,830
You can just throw up a machine at every
corner now and that just takes out the

2051
01:48:52,831 --> 01:48:56,880
whole entire store and all those
employees, you know, it's crazy. Yeah.

2052
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,820
Well there's that. Yeah.
Yeah. They figured out how
to cut the middleman, right.

2053
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:03,090
The fuck out of the picture. And see
DVDs are so easy to burn. You know?

2054
01:49:03,091 --> 01:49:07,220
It's so easy to make DVDs, so many fucking
steels wanting. You can replace it so,

2055
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:10,740
so hard. You could do one in your own
home computer. One are ridiculous.

2056
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:14,630
Is that he could make where they got
damn DVD on your home computer. Yeah.

2057
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:19,110
Where do they go? That's my hope.
We're a society than it go, you know,

2058
01:49:19,111 --> 01:49:21,930
because we keep inventing
crazier and crazier things.

2059
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:27,080
Like it's so funny if you go back and
look at like the pioneer days when they

2060
01:49:27,331 --> 01:49:29,940
crossed the, I was watching the show,
the one I was talking about earlier,

2061
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:31,780
the wild within the uh,
the,

2062
01:49:31,781 --> 01:49:35,160
the hunting show while I was watching
that and he tried to do what Lewis and

2063
01:49:35,161 --> 01:49:38,380
Clark did, they were like, they
made like boats out of like, um,

2064
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:41,430
buffalo skin and sticks and shit.
It was like craziness.

2065
01:49:41,431 --> 01:49:43,740
Like they tipped over in the water.
It was ridiculous.

2066
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:48,760
And I was thinking about it like them
living back there like that was just

2067
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:49,650
accepted.
Yeah,

2068
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:53,680
we're happy you had a gun and you would
link back to member of the old days when

2069
01:49:53,681 --> 01:49:57,490
folks had a kill things with spears and
you thought they were idiots. Right. Well,

2070
01:49:57,491 --> 01:50:01,090
how are the power people are going to
be looking at us just in a few years?

2071
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:03,850
Just in 20 years. Yeah. When I
see a new baby, I think, man,

2072
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:06,310
this kid's can be around
for like a hundred years.

2073
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,730
Madge and what's going to be going
on in a hundred years from now? Dude,

2074
01:50:10,270 --> 01:50:13,660
it's just saying we're a hundred
years ago. What was going on?

2075
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:17,020
It's happening so quick too.
It's like maybe it's not even a hundred.

2076
01:50:17,021 --> 01:50:19,870
Maybe it's like five or 10,
whatever the fuck.

2077
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:23,500
What's it like every year our knowledge
doubles or something that it's like some

2078
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:24,640
crazy number or it's just,

2079
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:28,540
it's going so fast and Japan's
even farther ahead than us.

2080
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:31,600
Here's an awesome quote and I can't
remember what the fuck it was,

2081
01:50:31,750 --> 01:50:36,730
but it was about, uh, gigabytes. It
was about how many gigabytes up from,

2082
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:41,410
I think it was like everything that
human d, the entire stored, um,

2083
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:45,760
results of all human writing and
knowledge and everything that's ever been

2084
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:47,230
written by people up until like,

2085
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:51,150
I think it was like 1996
or something like that.

2086
01:50:51,151 --> 01:50:54,550
It was like the date that they calculated
this was only like a certain amount of

2087
01:50:54,551 --> 01:50:58,750
gigabytes. Like ever, like a very, very
small, really? Yeah, very small round.

2088
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:03,190
But from then to now,
we generate that every two days.

2089
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:07,130
Wow. Holy Cow. Yeah,

2090
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:11,440
it's insane. And forgive me if I don't
exactly have the numbers correct.

2091
01:51:11,441 --> 01:51:15,250
It might've been 2001 it might not have
been 1996 this is all pulled off the top

2092
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:18,260
of my head, but they were talking
about how insane just the, uh,

2093
01:51:18,261 --> 01:51:22,970
the output of text and, and
information in ones and Zeros and, and,

2094
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:27,370
and just writing that people do now with
blogs and newspapers and news sites and

2095
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:28,204
this and that.

2096
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:32,020
Everything you read all day and photos
and Twitter and Facebook and constantly,

2097
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:35,290
you're constantly like putting out
gigabytes and gigabytes and gigabytes of

2098
01:51:35,291 --> 01:51:37,540
information. It's an a, the internet.

2099
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:43,120
Is there any possibility of fills up
or she could just go, let us expand.

2100
01:51:43,121 --> 01:51:46,810
It was this new internet they keep
talking about well to Internet two. Yeah.

2101
01:51:46,811 --> 01:51:48,610
I think right now it's just from,
for,

2102
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:53,160
it's either just for educational purposes
or just military purposes. Prett way,

2103
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:55,680
just faster. Pretty much. That's
all it is. It's not, well,

2104
01:51:55,690 --> 01:51:57,880
we shouldn't really ever talking about
her. We don't really understand it.

2105
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:01,810
I don't even know what the intern,
and I'm pretty sure what Internet two is.

2106
01:52:01,811 --> 01:52:06,520
Just using a different form of,
it's faster, it's faster. Will we?

2107
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:10,240
So we'll never fill up internet one
where it's like there's no more,

2108
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:14,170
no more websites. Yeah, I
think it's not going to change.

2109
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,400
I think it's going to
be the same internet,

2110
01:52:15,401 --> 01:52:20,020
just different speeds for most
US advanced network consortium.

2111
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:23,140
That's what they're calling
is a, everybody's still
mad at me about the n word.

2112
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:24,460
I guess it's an education thing.

2113
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:28,060
It says led by the research and education
community since 1996 Internet two

2114
01:52:28,061 --> 01:52:32,290
promotes the missions of its members
by providing leading edge network

2115
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:34,900
capabilities and unique
partnership opportunities together,

2116
01:52:34,901 --> 01:52:37,810
facilitate the development deployment
and use our revolutionary internet

2117
01:52:37,811 --> 01:52:40,420
technologies. You just said a whole
lot of nothing there, dude. Okay.

2118
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:40,991
You know what you said?

2119
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,720
You said this is some elite shit
that regular people can't get. Yeah.

2120
01:52:44,150 --> 01:52:45,980
That's why I'm thinking
when when this Zombie

2121
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:46,910
apocalypse happened,

2122
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:50,180
these fiber optics will be underground
and we'll still be able to communicate

2123
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:52,490
with each other,
but your AOL account will be dead.

2124
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:56,980
That's why I'm taking Samurai
classes. Really? You haven't taken,

2125
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,900
so just started your, but you've
become one of your own jokes now.

2126
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:03,480
Cause you said always look out
for a dude who has a sword. Yeah,

2127
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:07,950
that dude's shame. I am
shading. I like shady shit. My
friends are shady. So query,

2128
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:10,050
where are you taking
these Samurai classes? Uh,

2129
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:14,750
it's in century city and
it's an all like a scent.

2130
01:53:14,810 --> 01:53:18,410
Yeah. Century city. It's the what
do you do? Well, I just started,

2131
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:23,050
I've only taken a couple classes
so we learn us striking and the,

2132
01:53:23,060 --> 01:53:27,530
and then I'm about to take my first
sword class. I'm very excited.

2133
01:53:27,770 --> 01:53:30,830
So you learned striking weapons.
Jamraya weapon tree.

2134
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:35,090
So you weren't striking like karate, like
punching and kicking too. Yeah. So what,

2135
01:53:35,170 --> 01:53:40,040
what made you want to be a Samurai? Um,
something to do. Just a dream. I'm like,

2136
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:41,170
you know what? That's the dream. Yeah.

2137
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:44,810
I just taken acting classes and then
they make me miserable. Great teachers.

2138
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:47,150
But I was just miserable. So I'm
like, why do I want to do that?

2139
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:50,680
I want to do something I've always
wanted to do. Wow. Take Samurai class.

2140
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:52,910
You were taking acting classes.
You didn't like it.

2141
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:56,600
You decided to take Samurai
classes. Dude, that's funny man.

2142
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:01,580
How was your manager feel about
this? I don't know. Who knows?

2143
01:54:01,581 --> 01:54:05,150
I don't care anymore. I'm so over.
I just want to like have fun.

2144
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:08,300
You know what I'm saying? Are you
over it? Yeah. I'm just Kinda, I just,

2145
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:12,080
I enjoy it and I love doing what I do
and I'm happy with who I am as and now I

2146
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:17,020
just want to learn how the fuck can wield
a sword. I'm saying that's what I want.

2147
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:20,570
You know? It's when you come to a certain
point in your life where you're like,

2148
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:23,180
you realize that you're, you're making a
good living, doing what you want to do.

2149
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:25,820
Like you as a standup comedian in me,
you headline all over the country.

2150
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:28,190
Now I'm blessed. You have,
you have checks coming in.

2151
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:30,970
Once you get that freedom you
like, I can keep doing this, man.

2152
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:33,890
I can keep doing it. You can't stop
me from being funny. And then you go,

2153
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:37,460
I just want to be myself.
One day I just said no more bad gigs,

2154
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:41,870
not doing gigs. I don't want to
do. I'm just like, you know, I,

2155
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:45,080
I stopped the day job because
I hated being at the day job.

2156
01:54:45,740 --> 01:54:48,800
I started doing comedy because I wanted
that freedom and that's kind of like

2157
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:52,130
what I'm doing now. So I'm just rocking
Indian casinos. You know what I'm saying?

2158
01:54:52,190 --> 01:54:55,330
Live your life and have some
fun. Why not? That is really bad.

2159
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:57,320
And what it's all about
in the end, what, what,

2160
01:54:57,321 --> 01:55:00,050
what you have down as your
accomplishments is all nonsense.

2161
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:03,380
It's like how did you affect people
when that you came in contact with,

2162
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,860
how much fun did you have? Do you have
a good time? Did you spread a positive,

2163
01:55:07,050 --> 01:55:07,610
you know,

2164
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:11,940
overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly
negative message and you know,

2165
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:14,080
dispersion of energy while you were here?
Yeah,

2166
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:18,200
I mean like to do two hour set was so
much fun just to have it and see what was

2167
01:55:18,201 --> 01:55:20,300
working there and what
didn't work and you know,

2168
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:22,250
I was getting applause breaks on stuff.
I like,

2169
01:55:22,251 --> 01:55:26,120
if I like political material that you'd
totally wouldn't think I got an unique

2170
01:55:26,121 --> 01:55:28,310
casino in Oklahoma. Well that's
what I was talking about with bill,

2171
01:55:28,380 --> 01:55:29,300
with the Internet.

2172
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:33,080
It's like people have access in these
places and these rural communities now to

2173
01:55:33,110 --> 01:55:36,020
virtually everything that you have.
When I was living in Colorado, man,

2174
01:55:36,021 --> 01:55:38,450
I didn't feel disconnected when
I was in a town of, you know,

2175
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:40,340
a few hundred people on the
top of a mountain. Yeah.

2176
01:55:40,341 --> 01:55:43,100
It definitely keeps everybody close to
the front man too. It's a different,

2177
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:44,760
we live in,
Oh yeah.

2178
01:55:44,761 --> 01:55:48,390
You know what else he really thinks help
comedy to South Park and I think that's

2179
01:55:48,391 --> 01:55:51,570
because people are used to just fucked up.

2180
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,500
You know, I was doing the show
the other day and it's like, oh,

2181
01:55:55,501 --> 01:55:58,350
they're really young. They tend to
be more, I always thought they were,

2182
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:02,040
they were fun to do kind of dirty
jokes for but more risque stuff.

2183
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:04,990
They sometimes cringed and I was doing
it and they were just gone with them.

2184
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,170
I'm like, wow, that's so crazy. And
I was talking to them, they're like,

2185
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:10,110
well these kids all grew up on
south park. You know, they all,

2186
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:11,730
they all through snow.

2187
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:16,080
Like they get this weird sense of humor
that's not necessarily like you're being

2188
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:18,630
better than garbage pail kids
and the shit that, you know,

2189
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:22,530
we grew 100% when I used to do
colleges back when I was young.

2190
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:24,660
Then when I lived in New York,
I did a bunch of them.

2191
01:56:24,661 --> 01:56:28,030
There was one point where I did a whole
string where I would do like colleges

2192
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:30,030
for like you just months and months
at a time. Cause it was really,

2193
01:56:30,031 --> 01:56:32,760
really good money, like way more money
than I could ever make doing in clubs.

2194
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,600
But I would go in front of these kids
and he would talk about sex and there was

2195
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:40,290
so many virgins in the audience who was
so many people that would look back and

2196
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:43,620
forth at each other and they didn't have
a fucking clue what I was talking about.

2197
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,590
And I would say,

2198
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:48,600
I would say it like it took me a couple
of shows where till eventually went,

2199
01:56:48,601 --> 01:56:50,610
how many you guys have
never had sex before?

2200
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:53,070
Just kind of just give me a
little clap under the table.

2201
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:55,830
And they started laughing like it was.

2202
01:56:55,831 --> 01:56:59,670
So what they were thinking of
like it killed me saying that.

2203
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,140
How many guys have never had sex before?

2204
01:57:01,710 --> 01:57:02,960
Ah,
you knows

2205
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,040
Mike. Wow. You are like children now.

2206
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:08,520
They're doing math and fucking each
other in bathrooms and watching porn.

2207
01:57:08,610 --> 01:57:12,780
These kids have all grown up watching
like ass to mouth porn or hearing over and

2208
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:13,470
over.
Funny.

2209
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:18,470
I know like a virgin who have lost their
virginity later in life and the girls

2210
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:20,580
were like, I couldn't believe
he's actually good in bed.

2211
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,350
And I like that would
be trained. Right. Well,

2212
01:57:22,351 --> 01:57:25,320
these guys have been watching game
film for like the last 10 years.

2213
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:28,980
It's like if you had to watch
10 years of footage of football,

2214
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,500
you would know the play and
you just got that one time.

2215
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:34,440
I'd say like he actually knew to play
new as a throw it when he's opening.

2216
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,360
It's the same thing,
man.

2217
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,000
That's probably like a lot of guys
watch the UFC and think they know how to

2218
01:57:39,001 --> 01:57:42,660
choke somebody, Bro. I know how to do it,
bro. You got to get your hooks in. Well,

2219
01:57:42,661 --> 01:57:45,270
it should be easier though in
a weird way to like explain,

2220
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:48,690
oh this is the blah blah control. You're
like, oh. So I knew what that looks like.

2221
01:57:48,691 --> 01:57:50,880
So it's probably a little easier
than when there was nothing.

2222
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:53,550
Or if you were in a fight with somebody
and you had no martial arts experience

2223
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:53,971
whatsoever,

2224
01:57:53,971 --> 01:57:58,050
but you are a huge UFC fan and all of a
sudden in a scramble you wound up on top

2225
01:57:58,051 --> 01:58:00,830
of this guy. He'd be like, okay, I'm in
the mountain now. What? I do one truck,

2226
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:03,960
I've got to drop some bombs
and you hear your voice.

2227
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:06,790
Oh,
he's definitely hurt.

2228
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:10,290
Does a dude that we were hanging out
with in front of the Improv one night and

2229
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:13,740
he came to one of the shows and he said
he got beat up by these dudes and while

2230
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:16,830
he was getting beat up,
one guy was doing me,

2231
01:58:16,831 --> 01:58:20,220
he was doing an impression of me while
the other guy was hitting him and he said

2232
01:58:20,221 --> 01:58:22,800
he was getting his ass kicked and
while he's getting his ass kicked,

2233
01:58:22,801 --> 01:58:27,630
he thought it was fucking hilarious.
He was laughing and I'm like,

2234
01:58:27,631 --> 01:58:31,580
I'm sorry that it happened to you, dude.
That sucks. Yeah, dude, that's crazy.

2235
01:58:31,581 --> 01:58:34,650
Was the, had a great sense of humor about
it. I submitted it a video about it,

2236
01:58:34,651 --> 01:58:38,520
didn't we? In front of the Improv,
there's only youtube somewhere to do that.

2237
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,530
Great personality that you
could tell it dudes personality,

2238
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:45,550
but how he takes an ass kicking
some guys a story. Yeah. Like what?

2239
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:48,720
What made him get his ass? Katie tell you
that. Because he seems like a nice guy.

2240
01:58:48,721 --> 01:58:51,350
I think some guys just jumped him.
I think some douchebag.

2241
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:55,970
Why wouldn't he flipped a store? A standup
comic too? Yes, he was a standup comedy,

2242
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:00,350
open mics with him.
Who is this just some guy that you use?

2243
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:02,740
I think he works for Lynn
or something like that.

2244
01:59:02,770 --> 01:59:06,640
He was doing open mikes briefly and then
you just stopped doing it or he moved

2245
01:59:06,641 --> 01:59:10,180
on to somewhere else. He decided
he wanted to be happy. Right.

2246
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:13,330
There's a lot of guys that just
can't take it anymore. The pressure,

2247
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:15,880
the pressure of constantly trying
to come up with new material.

2248
01:59:15,881 --> 01:59:20,700
The pressure of performing, the pressure
of, I'm trying to advance so I like,

2249
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:22,930
I love writing and I'm,
oh I'm blessed.

2250
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:26,670
You know that I can write a lot but
sometimes I just get, I love standup.

2251
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:28,870
I just hate the businesses.
Sandy, don't you find it?

2252
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:32,080
The writing is all just a matter of
sitting around and doing it though.

2253
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:35,980
A lot of it is just forcing yourself to
do it and talk to myself all day lights.

2254
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:38,830
That's how I like to write. Do
you write on paper? Sometimes,

2255
01:59:38,831 --> 01:59:43,510
but mostly it's just like me turning bits
in the thing cause I know I'm going to

2256
01:59:43,511 --> 01:59:46,990
go up, so I'm just thinking of different
ideas and where I could fit this.

2257
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:50,040
And does it ever drive you
fucking crazy when you,

2258
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:53,920
you have an idea in your head and someone
just won't stop talking to you and

2259
01:59:53,921 --> 01:59:56,340
you're like, want to run away and you're
like, hold on a second, hold a second. No,

2260
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:59,020
no, no. But this guy was
like, don't talk right now.

2261
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:03,340
And like you have the slip reest of
grips on this brilliant fucking bit.

2262
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:06,400
And that's the cray you feel like
switching. Yeah. Right. It's terrible.

2263
02:00:06,430 --> 02:00:09,370
But you feel like an antisocial douche
bag for go and shop tops, tops top.

2264
02:00:09,580 --> 02:00:12,970
But meanwhile they're like stomping over
your beautiful collection. Like you,

2265
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,030
you've got some beautiful painting that
you're making but it's invisible and

2266
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:19,000
they're running in which shit on their
shoes. Just stamping all over. Oh yeah,

2267
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:20,321
it happened to me.

2268
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:23,800
I do that because what happened the
day I thought of something while I was

2269
02:00:23,860 --> 02:00:26,650
plugging in to an outlet in my bedroom,

2270
02:00:26,651 --> 02:00:30,700
I was plugging something in and I
thought of like this bit and I was like,

2271
02:00:30,701 --> 02:00:31,960
I gotta write this down.
I got her dead.

2272
02:00:31,961 --> 02:00:35,380
So I'm running to the living room and my
friend is like talking to me and I, no,

2273
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:38,540
no, no, stop, stop, stop. And
then he was like, wouldn't
stop like be quiet. I'm like,

2274
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:41,140
wait, I need to write something down.
And then like I tried to get like my,

2275
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:44,520
my whatever, my iPad on and it
was trying to type it and it,

2276
02:00:44,521 --> 02:00:48,870
while I was typing it slowly they kept
start talking again. I'm like, no, no.

2277
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,000
And I'm like, all right, I
forget the main part, whatever.

2278
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:57,690
It's the worst because it's,
you could be an have a,

2279
02:00:57,820 --> 02:01:01,810
I'd like of this slippery grip on the
most brilliant idea you like, fuck yes,

2280
02:01:01,811 --> 02:01:06,750
this is awesome. And for whatever
reason you barely have it. The Mat,

2281
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:10,420
the, your, your, your whole
on creativity and imagination.

2282
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:13,690
It's so requires like a shirt
and frequency in your brain.

2283
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:16,930
It's so requires like a certain
focus and when someone comes in,

2284
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:21,280
Hey Bang, Bang, Bang and
pants together, come on,

2285
02:01:21,281 --> 02:01:24,200
let's go outside to drink. All of
a sudden it's gone. You're out.

2286
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:27,610
Other than Saran second. I never think
about just saying it out loud either.

2287
02:01:27,611 --> 02:01:32,050
Like I never go. Okay. Uh, yeah, that
moon is a pie. Moon is a pie. You know,

2288
02:01:32,051 --> 02:01:34,150
they that would it be it
shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

2289
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:37,900
Moon is a pie yet maybe if you
said it, maybe it would work. Yeah,

2290
02:01:38,150 --> 02:01:40,280
maybe they would get someone.
Stop talking myself.

2291
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:43,270
I do that all the time. You do
that? Did I do that all the time?

2292
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:46,710
Well I just use the notepad feature in
the iPhone. The Oh, notepad features.

2293
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:51,090
Awesome. I have, I have a droid. We'll get
rid of that piece of shit. I'm waiting.

2294
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:54,840
I'm waiting till I know that iPhone is
not gonna be as good. Pi knows a bit.

2295
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,550
It's funny. Fight Story. Funny fight
story on my channel. Pull this shit up.

2296
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:00,200
Yeah.

2297
02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:03,440
Have you ever done a bit and you were
about to give it up and all of a sudden it

2298
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:05,720
catches fire.
I had this,

2299
02:02:05,740 --> 02:02:10,280
I do this bit about crimes of awesomeness
and I was started at when I was in

2300
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:13,520
Australia and it just was eating
it. But I'm like, that's so funny.

2301
02:02:13,790 --> 02:02:15,770
And I got back to the states
and I remember, I'm like,

2302
02:02:15,771 --> 02:02:19,610
I'm just going to try it because it
eight dogs, Dick fucking Australia.

2303
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:24,410
And I went there and again on state
and the place goes Ooh. And I'm like,

2304
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,820
I knew that was funny.
It was so interesting.

2305
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:29,270
So was it the Australians
didn't think it was funny. Yeah.

2306
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:30,620
So it's just their sense of humors.

2307
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:34,010
Just maybe it was just word play
that they didn't understand.

2308
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:37,190
Maybe I call it a homeless shelter,
but you know,

2309
02:02:37,191 --> 02:02:40,550
maybe they didn't know what that was and
they call it something else over there.

2310
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,500
But I, I, I didn't care enough about
the ass anybody at that point. Hey,

2311
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:48,240
what do you guys call? We call
it a day, ah, homeless loft.

2312
02:02:48,241 --> 02:02:50,060
There's some shit like that.
You know what I'm saying?

2313
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:54,890
So maybe if I tweaked it on in that way,
he could just be the sense of humor too.

2314
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:58,730
It's so funny how people in
other countries just have
completely defensible dude.

2315
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:02,680
Like you ever watch like English stand
up and they're laughing and shit and he

2316
02:03:02,681 --> 02:03:05,240
like, I don't understand what
they're saying. I don't get this. Oh,

2317
02:03:05,241 --> 02:03:09,620
I love the British House of Commons.
That's comedy. Did that, what does that,

2318
02:03:09,780 --> 02:03:12,470
he ever watched that? No,
the British House of Commons,

2319
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:16,340
like it's basically it's congress
meets a your Mama's competition.

2320
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:21,680
Why show? No, it's, they're a parliament.
It's a real, the real Paul. Yeah, Dude.

2321
02:03:21,681 --> 02:03:23,880
It is the best man use watch.

2322
02:03:23,881 --> 02:03:27,980
A guy gets up there and he'll give a
speech and people start heckling the shit

2323
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:31,310
out of him. Really? Yeah. Well they
were gonna send George Bush and,

2324
02:03:31,320 --> 02:03:33,200
but they're like, no, he can't
go in because they were going to,

2325
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,740
it's like trying to do the
Apollo, you know? Really? Yeah.

2326
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,720
It's like a white people's Apollos.
So awesome dude.

2327
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:42,500
I love watching it and like they get
snarky back and they kill hecklers.

2328
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:46,640
It's so much fun when you
watch this on a cspan. Whoa.

2329
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:52,400
Not Worth it. I don't know, man. It
sounds pretty fascinating. I love this.

2330
02:03:52,820 --> 02:03:57,050
I love almost everything British too.
Did dish people or it's fun.

2331
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:01,190
It's a fun place to party.
England's awesome. I always
love performing in England.

2332
02:04:01,191 --> 02:04:03,160
The people are cool as fuck.
We went here, this video. Yeah.

2333
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,130
Play that video real quick.

2334
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:05,960
This is the kid who was talking
about getting his ass kicked.

2335
02:04:06,970 --> 02:04:10,270
Yeah.
I was living in Chicago and uh,

2336
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:14,430
I was walking to work one morning
and these two kids out of nowhere,

2337
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:18,430
you're not going anywhere. You're
not going anywhere. I'm like,

2338
02:04:18,431 --> 02:04:22,330
I have to go to fucking work. Right. It
kept fucking hits me right in the jaw.

2339
02:04:22,360 --> 02:04:26,620
It was swollen like shit. And the
kid goes, he's rocked, he's rocked.

2340
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,800
And I watched fucking this guy
doing commentary and I'm like,

2341
02:04:29,801 --> 02:04:34,330
I know where that came. And that was my
first thought. Instead of, Oh my God,

2342
02:04:34,331 --> 02:04:38,930
I'm in trouble. My first thought is
this guy's quoting Joe Rogan, man.

2343
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,100
I'm fucking like all swollen up and shit
sitting there at the doctor. And, uh,

2344
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,173
my girl,

2345
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:47,143
what happened?

2346
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:52,900
Say email me, baggy on it.
It made my day, honestly,

2347
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:56,740
like is the only positive thing
from that story. But it made my day.

2348
02:04:59,030 --> 02:05:02,320
Oh, that's what it is.
He emailed me the story,

2349
02:05:02,321 --> 02:05:05,890
then I emailed him back and then
I came to show Larry a story.

2350
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:07,533
That's hilarious.

2351
02:05:09,050 --> 02:05:13,400
You're the, you're in the vernacular
brother. That's ridiculous. Rocked.

2352
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,290
Is it ever now I'm so conscious
of not saying it now because it's,

2353
02:05:17,310 --> 02:05:19,970
sometimes it just comes out, you
know? But sometimes I say, man,

2354
02:05:19,971 --> 02:05:21,860
I shouldn't say that shit
so often because people,

2355
02:05:21,861 --> 02:05:24,140
there's like the actual drinking game.
I say it so much.

2356
02:05:24,141 --> 02:05:28,820
This is a drinking game where someone,
when I say rock dudes do shots, you know,

2357
02:05:28,821 --> 02:05:31,910
and sometimes sometimes they'll get
the fucked up though, man. Yeah.

2358
02:05:31,911 --> 02:05:33,690
That's a big car.
You know,

2359
02:05:33,710 --> 02:05:36,740
I get a Frankie Edgar fight alone
could give you alcohol poisoning, dude.

2360
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:38,510
Have you ever been told like,
Hey,

2361
02:05:38,511 --> 02:05:42,170
if you say you've been
dude or a mountain dude,

2362
02:05:42,171 --> 02:05:46,520
you'd get $10,000 or like started
switching up your year commentary. Terry,

2363
02:05:46,521 --> 02:05:47,630
with some sponsors.

2364
02:05:50,730 --> 02:05:51,810
Do they do that?
Like,

2365
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:56,240
hey commentators to say like [inaudible]
you been snapped and do a slim Jim.

2366
02:05:56,270 --> 02:05:59,690
Well there's certain things that they
have for the show. Like you know this,

2367
02:05:59,770 --> 02:06:04,400
this clock is sponsored by call of duty
or something like that. Yeah. But the,

2368
02:06:04,401 --> 02:06:08,750
he can't just fucking in the middle of
your commentary. He's big captain crunch.

2369
02:06:08,810 --> 02:06:12,620
It's funny cause I just said fucking right
there and I caught myself as I said I

2370
02:06:12,621 --> 02:06:15,500
was Ooh I swore. Oh okay.
I'm not doing commentary,

2371
02:06:15,510 --> 02:06:18,710
I'm just talking on the podcast like
just thinking about commentary because I

2372
02:06:18,711 --> 02:06:21,680
have a very clear commentary
state of mind. Like it's very,

2373
02:06:21,681 --> 02:06:25,550
because it's very difficult for me to
talk for five hours and not swear. Yeah.

2374
02:06:25,551 --> 02:06:28,430
You know that's the hardest part about
it because when someone gets in I want to

2375
02:06:28,431 --> 02:06:31,070
go, oh shit. It's like natural.

2376
02:06:31,130 --> 02:06:36,130
So I have Doug like constantly be zen
and make sure that I saw like just then

2377
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:39,410
really just saying fucking there
was a part of me that went oops.

2378
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:43,310
Cause it's like commentary state
of mind. Right. Well it's tricky.

2379
02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:46,970
Sometimes I get book place with it like
cause I need the cash. There'll be like,

2380
02:06:46,971 --> 02:06:51,110
you can't swear. And I don't know why,
but when I'm told that I can do it,

2381
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:55,490
but my natural thing is f bombs and
all this stuff that right to say,

2382
02:06:55,491 --> 02:06:58,190
I just like, that's who I
am. But for some reason,

2383
02:06:58,191 --> 02:07:00,920
like when I go and like they say
to do stand up on television,

2384
02:07:00,980 --> 02:07:03,260
I was watching a burns last night.

2385
02:07:03,261 --> 02:07:07,370
He had a really good set and Lopez
attorney see the part where the, okay,

2386
02:07:07,371 --> 02:07:10,010
there we go. Oh, you're so much
louder. Yeah, they a really good part.

2387
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:13,800
He did really well on Lopez.
Let's do this. Yeah. And um,

2388
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:17,360
he dropped a beat to mom something I can,
I think he said Shit.

2389
02:07:17,361 --> 02:07:19,730
I'm not sure if you could say that,
but they beat them on that.

2390
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:23,660
Tbs is a cable station, right?
Is it FCC regulated? I don't see,

2391
02:07:23,661 --> 02:07:26,150
that's the whole weird,
I think it's not so much about regulation,

2392
02:07:26,151 --> 02:07:29,500
but it's more about not pissing off
sponsors. Right. Right. Right. Now. So he,

2393
02:07:29,501 --> 02:07:31,850
he got a beep on that and I was like,
oh,

2394
02:07:31,851 --> 02:07:34,130
I wonder if they're letting them do that.
But what I'm told,

2395
02:07:34,131 --> 02:07:35,980
I can't swear for some

2396
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:38,050
reason it's easy for me,

2397
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:41,950
right? Like you just go into that mode.
Yeah. The clean mode and you know,

2398
02:07:41,951 --> 02:07:43,510
there's a box that you're operating in.

2399
02:07:43,511 --> 02:07:45,250
We're just going to operate
in the clean mode box.

2400
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:48,760
When you're doing standup does ever
happen to you where you're talking and

2401
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:53,110
you're thinking, it's almost like
it's almost two different things.

2402
02:07:53,111 --> 02:07:55,990
Do you know what I'm saying it a bit,
but I'm going to, what am I doing here?

2403
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:59,170
And you're like, okay, where's this going?
What's going on over there? You know,

2404
02:07:59,171 --> 02:08:01,540
it's like,
it's not autopilot,

2405
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:04,210
but it's just an interesting thing
where you're like literally like,

2406
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:06,460
like multitasking.

2407
02:08:06,490 --> 02:08:09,040
That's why it's the most annoying thing
when there's a whole table full of

2408
02:08:09,041 --> 02:08:10,990
people talking really loud
while you're doing a bit.

2409
02:08:10,991 --> 02:08:14,590
Because while you're in the groove,
instead of just thinking about,

2410
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:16,870
here's the bit I'm doing and this
is what I'm going to do next,

2411
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:18,610
it's the bit I'm doing this,
what I'm gonna do next.

2412
02:08:18,611 --> 02:08:23,510
And what the fuck is going on over here
and some all this annoyance and Andy,

2413
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:27,690
there's bad crowd. These bad people or
audience members that are not, you know,

2414
02:08:27,710 --> 02:08:32,110
not following by the audience member,
comedian relationship,

2415
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:35,350
100% we're just ignoring it. They're just
being douche bag. So when you call it,

2416
02:08:35,351 --> 02:08:36,880
that's the worst.
When you called him on it,

2417
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:40,930
what did we do? And we didn't do anything
when they're doing anything wrong. Yeah.

2418
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:45,550
After you kill them, that's like
when you're no, a heckler war. Okay.

2419
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:49,870
And we'll go back and forth, but once I
own you and it's done, it's time to go.

2420
02:08:49,871 --> 02:08:53,710
It's like let's, that's the only time I
really get mad. It's like you've lost,

2421
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:58,840
you know it, you need a, you got
served tagline then or sorry, I,

2422
02:08:58,841 --> 02:08:59,500
you know,

2423
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:00,333
I'm just,

2424
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,060
the worst to me is when someone needs to
be kicked out and they don't get kicked

2425
02:09:04,061 --> 02:09:05,710
out. And then the, the people
want to keep them there,

2426
02:09:05,711 --> 02:09:07,840
like the clubs trying to keep them
there and you got to go, look man,

2427
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:11,320
this is not going to, you got a table
full of drunk people yelling shit, Shit.

2428
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:15,970
Divert taking chip bouncer story. A
chick bouncer. Well she bounced this,

2429
02:09:15,971 --> 02:09:18,730
another chick bounce and other
chick. What did I have? No,

2430
02:09:18,731 --> 02:09:22,870
I have not told you this. So anyways,
um, and if I told you you can stop me,

2431
02:09:22,871 --> 02:09:25,180
maybe you did.
And I don't remember doing it halfway.

2432
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:27,540
And I go to the comedy store,
I pull in and I'm,

2433
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:32,640
I'm next Brody Stevens is on stage and
he's got this crazy drunk Australian girl

2434
02:09:32,741 --> 02:09:35,170
on there and I could
tell it's not going good.

2435
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:38,290
No one's laughing and it's
just weird energy in a room.

2436
02:09:38,291 --> 02:09:42,130
And I walk in and he sees me. He goes,
Sam, do you want me to leave her on stage?

2437
02:09:42,131 --> 02:09:44,770
I like no, get her off.
The place goes crazy.

2438
02:09:44,771 --> 02:09:48,280
So automatically right there I noticed
she's, the crowd doesn't like this girl,

2439
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:51,730
right? So anyways, Brody kicks her off,

2440
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:53,500
he brings me on stage and we have this,

2441
02:09:53,501 --> 02:09:56,000
have this weird kind of
exchange and it's like we're,

2442
02:09:56,050 --> 02:09:59,440
we're having fun with each other, but
we're kind of zingy each other. Yeah.

2443
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,070
So he's walking out, we're
zinging each other. She just,

2444
02:10:03,130 --> 02:10:06,960
this drunk girl comes off the Strunk
Australian girl comes up and just starts

2445
02:10:06,961 --> 02:10:10,990
screaming at me, get off stage.
You're not funny. And I'm like,

2446
02:10:10,991 --> 02:10:12,520
and I'm just zinging I'm killing her now.

2447
02:10:12,521 --> 02:10:14,200
She's walked all the
way to the front of the,

2448
02:10:14,201 --> 02:10:18,890
or she's in the front row pointing at me
standing up, you've got funny, get the,

2449
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:22,020
and then she's now she's getting nasty
cause I'm just killing her in the place

2450
02:10:22,021 --> 02:10:26,060
is going nuts, kill, kill,
kill again. And she's like, Oh,

2451
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:30,520
you're not funny. And then I'm like, okay,
where are the bouncers at this moment?

2452
02:10:30,521 --> 02:10:34,160
Okay. It's because they have
like, uh, like, um, like

2453
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:38,810
emos over there working, you know guys
who look like they're in like catch cabs,

2454
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:43,730
QT bands, you know what I'm saying? Like
playing keyboards and shit. And I'm like,

2455
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:45,530
where are nothing? Nothing, nothing.

2456
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:48,910
She screaming at me all
the sudden out of nowhere,

2457
02:10:48,940 --> 02:10:53,940
this like five foot six Italian girl
walks up and I think she's with her cause

2458
02:10:53,991 --> 02:10:57,830
she walks up to the girl,
grabs her look, spins around,

2459
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:01,790
smacks around the ass, spends
her background, picks her up,

2460
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:06,740
carries her out fireman style.
Holy Shit. Holy Shit. I'm like,

2461
02:11:06,741 --> 02:11:09,050
what is going on?
Brings her outside,

2462
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:12,110
basically gets her face
so don't go back inside.

2463
02:11:12,111 --> 02:11:16,370
Bitch walks back up and I'm like, Holy
Shit. She didn't know her. I'm like,

2464
02:11:16,371 --> 02:11:19,190
did you know her? She goes, no,
she's fucking annoying. I'm like,

2465
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:24,340
did you just regular holy shit that the
craziest Shit I've ever wish you had

2466
02:11:25,521 --> 02:11:29,840
that on video man. It is literally the
bullying, the best heckles stories ever.

2467
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:32,390
It takes too much time to get the video.

2468
02:11:32,610 --> 02:11:36,320
Does should be a special button on
your phone where you have to press.

2469
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:39,980
It's really hard to press but the video
camera instantly comes on, you know,

2470
02:11:39,981 --> 02:11:41,750
so it's a one one press button.

2471
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:45,550
Just you could just a fucked up situation
button you can do that. I found,

2472
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:49,520
I think you program the buttons a
home button to launch an application,

2473
02:11:49,521 --> 02:11:53,600
can't you? You can do that. You are
so light years ahead of me, dude.

2474
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:56,780
I have no clue. But that's ridiculous
because if your phone's on on,

2475
02:11:56,810 --> 02:11:59,690
on standby and you press it,
you first of all,

2476
02:11:59,691 --> 02:12:02,450
you have to put it in your fucking
code first. And I get these time. Well,

2477
02:12:02,451 --> 02:12:05,110
I mean if you had it could have
deactivate your code, right?

2478
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:07,790
So you'd have to wonder why don't around
town hoping that you don't drop your

2479
02:12:07,791 --> 02:12:10,890
phone and people don't get all
your cock pictures. What I mean?

2480
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:14,280
I mean I'm just saying, I mean I don't
have any coq pictures on my phone,

2481
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:17,580
nothing about that.
But that would be the shit though.

2482
02:12:17,581 --> 02:12:21,200
If there was some way you can just
press it in instantly immediately starts

2483
02:12:21,201 --> 02:12:25,570
videotaping shit, you know,
light on go go gadget. I'm like,

2484
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:28,160
where's my camera? Why didn't I have
that moment? How long ago was this?

2485
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:31,490
I'd say about a year ago. So you could
have had that on your phone. Yeah,

2486
02:12:31,520 --> 02:12:33,170
mother fucker.
That would be funny.

2487
02:12:33,290 --> 02:12:36,650
I should record all my sets cause she
hadn't touched that crazy bitch I've had.

2488
02:12:36,651 --> 02:12:38,700
She's just doing it.
The girls all the time and he grow.

2489
02:12:38,701 --> 02:12:43,430
Does that once the ass was the best part,
it was like I own you smack, I own you.

2490
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:47,540
I own you smack from a chick. Did
you get turned on at all? Yeah,

2491
02:12:47,541 --> 02:12:51,480
I find that stuff hot. I find chicks
who kick ass crazy bitches like that.

2492
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:55,740
There's something about you wanting them
to give into you and accept your yeah,

2493
02:12:56,190 --> 02:12:58,970
I'm telling Ya. That's what
I love. Really smart chicks.

2494
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:02,900
It's just fun to like make them say
like really crazy weird degrading shit.

2495
02:13:02,990 --> 02:13:05,780
Oh yes. Was smart tricks or the
promise smartsocks are though.

2496
02:13:05,960 --> 02:13:08,700
They're smart and you can't get away
with everything that you can with dumb

2497
02:13:08,701 --> 02:13:12,020
chicks and you, you have to, you know
they all again, arguments and shit.

2498
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:14,120
The investigator know they the,

2499
02:13:14,121 --> 02:13:17,480
the government wishes they had the rights
that women had where they could just

2500
02:13:17,481 --> 02:13:21,180
go through all your emails and all
that Shit. There's a woman that,

2501
02:13:21,181 --> 02:13:24,030
it was a dating this guy and it was
another one. It was a hot woman.

2502
02:13:24,031 --> 02:13:27,950
There was dating a guy who was an
ugly dude and she, uh, she wasn't,

2503
02:13:27,951 --> 02:13:31,620
she was even open about it.
She was telling people at the supermarket.

2504
02:13:31,621 --> 02:13:32,280
I heard her telling

2505
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,490
people about, uh, about, uh,
how she had been planning it.

2506
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,790
I think it was at the supermarket,
might be disinformation. Anyway,

2507
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:42,000
she'd planned it like months in advance
and she was going through all of his

2508
02:13:42,001 --> 02:13:45,680
finances to make sure that he wasn't
hiding things. And Oh my God, that's,

2509
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:48,720
that's the thing that drives me every,
every nickel.

2510
02:13:48,721 --> 02:13:52,800
This guy made down to a science as threats
chapel a lot out how much she can get.

2511
02:13:52,801 --> 02:13:57,180
And it was terrible. Women do that, man.
They'll also lap relationships. They seem,

2512
02:13:57,181 --> 02:14:00,940
one's going down. They'll ra
hell let it go. Somebody said,

2513
02:14:00,990 --> 02:14:03,300
I don't remember who the fuck it was.
It might've been Patrice O'Neal,

2514
02:14:03,301 --> 02:14:06,240
but it's really funny. I don't remember
who it was. It might've been me.

2515
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:10,240
I don't even know. But anyway,
that chicks, when they're
swinging, you know, they'll,

2516
02:14:10,330 --> 02:14:11,160
they're like monkeys.

2517
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:14,220
They want to make sure there's another
branch there to catch it. They don't know.

2518
02:14:14,390 --> 02:14:18,360
They don't, they don't want to be
walking out in the plains by themselves.

2519
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:22,060
They don't like to have, they don't like
to have downtime to get to know them.

2520
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:25,800
So you got to take care of yourself
and by your own meals, you know,

2521
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:27,570
especially girls who
get into that situation.

2522
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:30,030
You get into a situation where you
dating someone who's got some cash,

2523
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:33,660
you know he'd ever been in a situation
where there's a girl who just got done

2524
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:36,420
dating a guy with cash and you're broke
and you're like, what the fuck? Yeah,

2525
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:39,870
that sucks. Worst. You feel
so like dehumanize. Yeah.

2526
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:42,750
Well Mike and I used to go on vacations
and I know you can't afford that,

2527
02:14:42,751 --> 02:14:46,070
so it's no big deal. They're just, yeah,

2528
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:50,940
just keeping the bed warm places.
That's the mother fuckers. Mike,

2529
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:52,230
what they use to take you on Vicodin.
I know.

2530
02:14:52,231 --> 02:14:55,830
Like always wanting to go on vacations
nonstop. That's, yeah, because that's,

2531
02:14:55,831 --> 02:14:57,180
girls want to be pampered.
They want to go,

2532
02:14:57,181 --> 02:14:59,490
let's go to the spa and then that vision,

2533
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:03,870
they love visuals of new
places. Like, Ooh, look at this.

2534
02:15:03,930 --> 02:15:07,560
It's also that they want to go on
vacation because it represents opulence.

2535
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:10,290
It represents they're being taken
care of. You know? Here we are.

2536
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:15,100
We're on a vacation. Yay. You took
me on Zoloft, primal man vacation.

2537
02:15:15,450 --> 02:15:19,260
Saw that. That's evolutionary
psychology, man. That is all primal shit.

2538
02:15:19,290 --> 02:15:22,080
You can't hate the chicks were wanting
that any more than they can hate you for

2539
02:15:22,081 --> 02:15:25,350
wanting a nice juicy ass and I knew
juicy ass every once in a while.

2540
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:28,620
Oh Sam tripling opened up.
Deadbox sorry about that.

2541
02:15:28,621 --> 02:15:32,160
It's hard to keep it together, isn't
it? As we try my best, it's so hard.

2542
02:15:33,130 --> 02:15:35,850
Monkey DNA wants to spread.

2543
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:37,500
Whoo. Whoo, whoo, whoo.

2544
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:41,050
I think that's it. That's the
end of this fucking show. Jesus.

2545
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:43,350
When you said you're an animal sounds,
it's time to end the show.

If you don't have tickets to
tomorrow night, you want to go,

2567
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:51,970
you got to get them now because
the fucker will sell out.

2568
02:16:51,971 --> 02:16:54,610
It sells out every single time.
And the fucking show is hilarious.

2569
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:56,320
And like I said,
it's not just a comedy show,

2570
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:59,590
it's a comedy show and they have videos
and they have like games they play with

2571
02:16:59,591 --> 02:17:03,400
the audience and it's all like fast and
it keeps moving and all the comics or

2572
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:07,330
add theater. But it's total add
theater. It's fun. It's a fun show.

2573
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:09,430
The naughty shows us
solid cause like I said,

2574
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:13,360
it really should be like one
of those casinos in Vegas.
It would be a great show.

2575
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:16,150
Like if someone picked it up and put it
out, you want to go for the hard rock,

2576
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,920
you know? And that's where they
had Beecher's madhouse too,

2577
02:17:17,921 --> 02:17:20,710
which is a very sort of similar zone here.
Now is he out here now?

2578
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:23,630
He's at the Roosevelt. Well
that thing that he had, the uh,

2579
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:25,720
in the hard rock was really successful.

2580
02:17:25,721 --> 02:17:27,850
They would sell that out all
the time and he's a great,

2581
02:17:27,990 --> 02:17:29,570
but it was more of a nightmare for comics.

2582
02:17:29,571 --> 02:17:33,020
So comics would do that and they have
harsh always war gig. After that,

2583
02:17:33,050 --> 02:17:33,401
I was like,

2584
02:17:33,401 --> 02:17:37,060
you would go to battle with a bunch of
psychos and swatching you'd walk into

2585
02:17:37,090 --> 02:17:40,930
sound. It was a wall of sound. You
could feel the sound on your skin.

2586
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:44,080
It was so loud and you just throw

2587
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:49,840
to the darkness and you just all,
you didn't want to get booed.

2588
02:17:49,841 --> 02:17:53,230
And I remember I had to file Paris
Hilton one time there. Did you ever,

2589
02:17:53,290 --> 02:17:56,260
did I ever tell you this story will
end on this? We'll end on this.

2590
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:59,920
I had the fall, Paris Hilton. They're
like, we got surprise guests and uh,

2591
02:17:59,950 --> 02:18:02,900
she just has to go up real quick. And I'm
like her. She's like, yeah, it's parasail.

2592
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:06,790
And I'm like, oh no. And then dude,

2593
02:18:06,791 --> 02:18:09,100
she's going up there and you knew
what was going to happen. She's,

2594
02:18:09,250 --> 02:18:13,660
they're going nuts for her nuts. And
I'm like, ah, good. Not good or bad.

2595
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:18,170
Great. Love her. They love her.
Like, you know, like royalty,

2596
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:21,180
Nelson Mandela entering
like the World Cup arena.

2597
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:25,510
Like there's are all knuckleheads from
Idaho that are on vacation loving her and

2598
02:18:25,511 --> 02:18:28,090
they can't believe they're seeing royalty.
And it just goes,

2599
02:18:28,091 --> 02:18:29,800
and then they're like,
okay, thank you know,

2600
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:32,860
and barely even says it's
comedian Sam Tripoli.

2601
02:18:32,861 --> 02:18:37,660
And I walk out and dude, I started
thrown. All of a sudden, boom, boom,

2602
02:18:37,870 --> 02:18:39,100
boom.
I started hearing a couple.

2603
02:18:39,130 --> 02:18:42,910
Now I'm like Bruce Lee in the movie when
he tastes his own blood and his crazy

2604
02:18:42,911 --> 02:18:47,560
eyes happens, gets that.
And I just locked down dude.

2605
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:50,740
And I turned the booze because the key
to that room was getting the girls on

2606
02:18:50,741 --> 02:18:53,290
your side. Once you've got them on
your side, you could start killing.

2607
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:57,160
So start out booing at the end. I got
a standing o everybody there was like,

2608
02:18:57,190 --> 02:19:00,400
I've never seen that before. You turn
them around. I turned them around.

2609
02:19:00,430 --> 02:19:03,790
I just stayed in the pocket sun. You
know, that's comedy store for you, dude.

2610
02:19:03,791 --> 02:19:04,930
That's the thing about the comedy store.

2611
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:07,450
You're so used to taking care of
your own crowd because there's no,

2612
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:09,130
you get in the Improv with someone yells,

2613
02:19:09,131 --> 02:19:11,620
there's a big guy who comes over and puts
his hands on the guy's shoulder goes,

2614
02:19:11,621 --> 02:19:14,050
bro, you gotta shut the fuck up or
leave. It's really sounding. Yep.

2615
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:16,270
And they stopped it and they,
it keeps a nice friendly show.

2616
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:19,870
But the problem with that is you don't
develop those combat comedy skills.

2617
02:19:20,080 --> 02:19:23,360
You gotta have those combat comedy skills
and that's come through is my over a

2618
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:28,010
decade at the comedy store, man, you
learn. And I had thrown at me in that

2619
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,680
place. I've never had a glass above.

2620
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:36,260
I've had water bottles thrown at
me. People are savages, you know,

2621
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:36,861
and more,

2622
02:19:36,861 --> 02:19:40,460
more like disenfranchise people go to
that club than any other club in the

2623
02:19:40,461 --> 02:19:43,370
country. And He, like you said,
emo bouncers, the whole thing.

2624
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:46,670
It's God damn nightmare. You're bouncing.
Shouldn't have sweater vests. That's all.

2625
02:19:46,671 --> 02:19:51,200
I guess that's the, the
outfit. The hipster outfit,
right? Yeah. Sweater vests.

2626
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:54,300
I don't know how having bad
eyesight as hip now too.

2627
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:57,020
Maybe that's me just getting old.
It's some weird, creepy thing.

2628
02:19:57,021 --> 02:20:00,500
Like you want to look like your mom's dad.
Yeah. It's, you know, when he was young,

2629
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:06,440
whatever. Bitches. That's it. That's it
for the show this week. Um, next week,

2630
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:08,480
uh,
Bobby Lee is going to be on Tuesday,

2631
02:20:08,510 --> 02:20:12,450
so fired up about that and we're
probably going mad to get, uh,

2632
02:20:12,870 --> 02:20:17,030
everyone tweet him so he won't
back down like nonstop tweeting.

2633
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:21,220
They can't ways or a bit flaky.
But who isn't? Comics are,

2634
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:23,330
I mean that's one of the things
about Sam triply. That's an unusual,

2635
02:20:23,331 --> 02:20:26,840
you're very funny yet. You're very
disciplined. Very sure you get on,

2636
02:20:26,841 --> 02:20:30,330
you're always on time for shit. And
some Keno Comics, he never sleeps.

2637
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:34,910
The funny ones are crazy. Joe
Diaz is crazy. You know, crazy.

2638
02:20:34,960 --> 02:20:38,390
Noro people are entertaining. This
is something of a, we're not perfect.

2639
02:20:38,391 --> 02:20:40,460
We're fucked up humans. But um, uh,

2640
02:20:40,461 --> 02:20:43,550
so next week Bobby Lee and hopefully
we're going to get Jody as an Ari Shaffir

2641
02:20:43,551 --> 02:20:46,200
in studio because we've got a studio
now. Bitches. That's what I'm calling it.

2642
02:20:46,201 --> 02:20:50,210
I love it. And it seems like a studio.
It's nice to be, yeah, because a,

2643
02:20:50,211 --> 02:20:53,720
we're doing that show a, which is next
Friday night at Mandalay bay. Okay.

2644
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:56,870
We love you bitches and uh, we'll see
you next week. Thanks for tuning in.

2645
02:20:56,930 --> 02:21:01,790
As always, much appreciated.
Much love. Much good things,
positive energy, your way.

2646
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,120
You do not have to be to you that you
were all your life. You know how to do it.

2647
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:06,500
Rock it out, do it, do it right.

2648
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:07,340
Just do it.
