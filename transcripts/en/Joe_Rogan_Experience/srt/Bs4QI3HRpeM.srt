1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,270
And doing it again,

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,940
I can.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,890
That's my new opening.

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,210
Sorry.

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:10,710
Voice.

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:10,940
Yeah.

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,660
It's nothing so it doesn't
even seem like I'm trying just.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,830
It's just coming out.

9
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,840
It's coming out like that.

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,580
You know what it is because
you speak the truth.

11
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,770
It's just the truth coming out.

12
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,640
Truth coming out in my angel voice.

13
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,130
I told you,

14
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,110
that's what I go.

15
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,971
How do you sing like that?

16
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:24,870
You didn't even warm up.

17
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:25,351
She goes,

18
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:25,981
what are you talking about?

19
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:26,370
I go,

20
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:26,971
you just go eat.

21
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:27,691
Ate a big dinner,

22
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:28,210
and you just got up,

23
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,100
sang and she goes,

24
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,911
I don't know.

25
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,070
I just tell the truth and everything
else takes care of itself.

26
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,590
But that pitches like the Michael Jordan
of soldiery songs know she could sing

27
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,060
the fucking shit out of some music.

28
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,750
Unreal.

29
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,750
The Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by WHO's today?

30
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,181
Oh,

31
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:45,690
well,

32
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,171
first of all,

33
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,070
on [inaudible] dot com.

34
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,130
That's our main sponsor on it is the
supplement slash lifestyle company.

35
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,240
I don't like calling
anything a lifestyle company.

36
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,410
We were going to have to come up
with a good name for what it is.

37
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,760
It sounds so not Joe Rogan,

38
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,010
so gay and like force,

39
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,510
like sell a lifestyle.

40
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,950
We were talking to this guy who,

41
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,310
uh,

42
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,731
he,

43
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,450
um,

44
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,450
produces podcasts for a friend of ours
and we were at the Improv and homeboy

45
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,130
battered us with these industry terms.

46
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:14,910
Do we,

47
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,950
weren't you there when
that conversation was like,

48
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,070
you guys done a really good job of
projecting you're exactly where you're

49
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,481
talking about.

50
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:20,850
It's really,

51
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,960
really good job of predicting,

52
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,220
projecting your brand.

53
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:23,431
I was like,

54
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,900
what the F I want to kill you.

55
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm going to kill you if you don't get
away from me talking to this fucking

56
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,210
joke.

57
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:28,560
You.

58
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,060
I'm not thinking about a brand.

59
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm thinking about doing something good.

60
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,850
You're a goddamn vampire,

61
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:33,210
sir.

62
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,043
You don't even know.

63
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,580
Let's be honest.

64
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:34,790
No.

65
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,100
What'd you say that when you say branding
a brand that takes away the purity of

66
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,860
the intention,

67
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,650
right?

68
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:40,441
Let's be honest.

69
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,660
It's the onnit call is what you'd call it.

70
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,051
Well,

71
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:43,950
I don't even want to call it the.

72
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,060
I don't want to name it,

73
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,080
but you know what it is.

74
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,680
But listen man,

75
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,130
I'm not,

76
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,551
I'm not.

77
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,860
I'm not susceptible to call the
stuff and everything you sell.

78
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,490
I'm like,

79
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,860
I want those chimps.

80
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,580
I'm 45.

81
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:53,821
I'm like,

82
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,091
I,

83
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:54,481
oh sorry.

84
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:54,910
I can't say,

85
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,850
but I just want those and then I
want the jerky and all stuff I use.

86
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,301
Well,

87
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:00,781
you know,

88
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,350
there's like,

89
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,270
there's a lack of a celebration of a
fucking exciting manly shit in this

90
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:06,750
country.

91
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,490
Of course is.

92
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,490
There's a big suppression of it and
we add on it or a against that whole

93
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:17,280
heartedly and we think
it'll take supplements if
we had stuff that makes your

94
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:17,970
dick hard.

95
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,930
We're going to look into that.

96
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,080
We got some hard dick natural supplements.

97
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,140
W will get you those.

98
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:22,380
We'll,

99
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,730
we'll find out there any good.

100
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,830
We'll run some tests and we'll get you.

101
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,420
The data exists,

102
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,280
but the stuff that we have,

103
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,380
everything that we have
is shit that we use.

104
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:34,200
We use the best quality ingredients.

105
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,100
We put together the best possible
combination of these things,

106
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,230
whether it's for Alpha brain or knew mood,

107
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,920
knew mood is a fascinating one because
you know there's a lot of people in this

108
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,770
country that are on stimulant or well,

109
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:48,450
there's a lot of people that are on
stimulants where there's a lot of people

110
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,970
that are on Ssri antidepressants.

111
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:55,971
They're on things that
essentially stimulate serotonin
in your mind or or add it

112
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:57,631
to your brain,

113
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:57,841
you know,

114
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,940
you can add it artificially or five htp

115
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,140
and l trip defender.

116
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,141
Two different ways that it boosts your
brain's production of Serotonin and five

117
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,700
htp hasn't been as it's
been explained to me,

118
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,060
five hcb converts into Serotonin and
Tryptophan converts into five htp,

119
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,480
so when you put them together,

120
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,800
it's like a time release thing.

121
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:18,820
It's just,

122
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,301
it's all.

123
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:24,301
It's just science about nutrition and
what is effective for what aspect of

124
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,871
performance,

125
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,400
whether it's mental performance like
Alpha brain or physical performance like

126
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:30,761
shroom,

127
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,001
tech,

128
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:31,720
sport.

129
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,090
All of it is described on it.

130
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,240
We describe why we're selling.

131
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,190
This is what it is.

132
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,900
This is why.

133
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
How we got involved in it.

134
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,010
This is,

135
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,130
these are the people that tell you it's
good and we're dealing with professional

136
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,150
poker players.

137
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,260
A lot of pro athletes love all the
different products because they,

138
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
they're just,

139
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,370
it's,

140
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,860
we're just trying to find the
most effective shit out there.

141
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,820
What's the best shit?

142
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,773
Let's sell it.

143
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,460
We were talking about Kale shakes.

144
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:57,710
I make Kale shakes almost every
morning and I haven't all week though,

145
00:03:57,711 --> 00:03:59,530
a three days in a row and
I do feel the difference.

146
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,180
Feel like a fat fuck today.

147
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,940
Your skin is positive and glowing.

148
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,880
A lot of water.

149
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,440
Um,

150
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,540
so we decided to get BLENDTEC blenders.

151
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,840
We found those are the best we're selling
as we sell them $200 less than the

152
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,610
manufacturer suggested retail price.

153
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,290
Just because we're trying to sell you the
best shot possible at the lowest price

154
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:17,681
possible.

155
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,900
That that is the number
one goal with on it.

156
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,520
And everything we sell you is shit.

157
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,160
We use metal belt.

158
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,243
No scarves.

159
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,390
I'm against old dudes with scarves.

160
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,830
And I think Randy coture,

161
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
feminist scholar,

162
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,790
but he's been wearing a scarf lately
and I just want to talk to randy couture

163
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,010
was such a bad motherfucker.

164
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,630
Turn it around his neck.

165
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,040
Who Cares?

166
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,930
Ballet could be in a leotard
and I'd still be like,

167
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:39,640
stay away from me.

168
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,180
He could go out to clubs with a real
legitimate albatross around his neck and

169
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,060
you wouldn't care.

170
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,721
Speaking of which,

171
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:47,600
did you see Matt Makani in magic?

172
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,080
Mike?

173
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,321
No,

174
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:48,800
I missed that.

175
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,720
I never met anybody wanting to
have sex to themselves more.

176
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,563
That guy.

177
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,850
Oh God.

178
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,691
I mean he.

179
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:54,361
I guarantee you.

180
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:54,700
Jerks.

181
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:54,981
Officers,

182
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:55,581
highlight reel.

183
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:55,860
He.

184
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,860
He basically has just stock footage of
him stretching his character or Matt

185
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:01,763
mcconaughey.

186
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,541
Hey,

187
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,580
the human factors.

188
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,260
It's like,

189
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,740
why don't you take that role,

190
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
take that role.

191
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,200
You took that role so you could
wear outfits and go and go.

192
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,871
That's what he does.

193
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,600
And I've never seen anyone.

194
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,680
Now I have to go through it.

195
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,140
It's a bigger why commercials with.

196
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:20,930
Sorry,

197
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,220
sorry.

198
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:21,550
Sorry.

199
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,080
Because I need to know about this
because I saw the ad for that.

200
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:25,160
I got a little panicky.

201
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:25,750
Oh No,

202
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,090
we ads.

203
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,680
We're so gay that I was like,

204
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:28,520
what's going on here?

205
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:29,300
What is this?

206
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,500
Tatum o'neal or whatever
the guy's name is.

207
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,943
He couldn't look better.

208
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,941
Handsomest guy.

209
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:36,740
I hung out with him in
Vegas for a weekend.

210
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,340
Women literally start just operating
in his presence and he's a great guy.

211
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,060
They must panic.

212
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,250
He said he was an athlete
going on with the sound.

213
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:44,084
Brian.

214
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,093
That sound like a pool.

215
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,920
When he's talking,

216
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,130
it's getting really loud or
screaming into a microphone.

217
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,143
Probably not.

218
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,270
It's normal.

219
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm using my stage voice now.

220
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:52,140
Mine is down.

221
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,340
I want to talk about chapter two.

222
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:53,820
Dance

223
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,141
therapy.

224
00:05:54,141 --> 00:05:55,010
Screaming in the voice.

225
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:55,920
It's not going to pop the minute,

226
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,080
but it doesn't sound good.

227
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,590
This.

228
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,423
It's very gay.

229
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,263
The easiest thing.

230
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:00,790
Well,

231
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,411
something's wrong.

232
00:06:01,411 --> 00:06:02,520
I'm not hearing myself.

233
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,530
You're not hearing.

234
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,890
You're not like a like a little.

235
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,140
There you go guys.

236
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,741
If you screw up,

237
00:06:08,741 --> 00:06:11,700
just get your microphone technique.

238
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,930
I start talking about channing
tatum and my voice was like,

239
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,020
but it shouldn't crack that easy.

240
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:16,410
Brian.

241
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,160
This is like some little
crackle when it gets high here.

242
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,600
That.

243
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:19,871
Yeah,

244
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,460
because you're screaming
into a microphone.

245
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,710
When you're,

246
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,320
when you're,

247
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,041
when you're on stage,

248
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,491
it happens.

249
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,990
You just can't hear it
because it's a big stage,

250
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,640
but when you're in a recording studio,

251
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,810
you're screaming in a microphone.

252
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:29,644
You're going to.

253
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,330
Don't say,

254
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,230
this is a new thing.

255
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,891
Here's what we could do.

256
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:33,940
We could turn it down like this.

257
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:37,150
You could turn your headphones up
right now and it'll be really quiet.

258
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,540
You're just not going to pop the mic.

259
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,831
All right.

260
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,540
Just try,

261
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,350
try turning one of these knobs right here.

262
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,531
Track check.

263
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,520
I like Tacos.

264
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,510
Highlight Tacos.

265
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,010
Going to be in Columbus,

266
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,150
Ohio this week.

267
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,140
Or in Ohio.

268
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,490
If you want to go to a show,

269
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,660
go to a desk while TV.

270
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,070
You're going to be with Tom Segura.

271
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,300
Doug Benson.

272
00:06:59,600 --> 00:06:59,880
Uh,

273
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,380
yeah.

274
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,430
We got a Dayton,

275
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:02,780
Ohio on the eighth,

276
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,800
which is Thursday,

277
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,690
Cincinnati on Friday,

278
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,760
and then Saturday we have a Columbus,

279
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,390
Ohio.

280
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,280
And if you use the coupon
code in Cincinnati,

281
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,120
Red Cross,

282
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,530
you get two for one tickets.

283
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,790
Also 10 percent of the portion of the
ticket sales goes to hurricane relief for

284
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,293
Indiana.

285
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,493
And

286
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,950
why keep making upstairs and
you can get hit by hurricanes.

287
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,150
You son of a bitch.

288
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,313
That sound better.

289
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,253
Much better.

290
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,670
Yeah.

291
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:28,911
The,

292
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,061
uh,

293
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:29,990
the microphone cord.

294
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,280
That's what it was that the,

295
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:31,850
um,

296
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,140
the headphone Jack was really,

297
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:33,974
really low.

298
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,520
I'm honored.

299
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:35,990
Uh,

300
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,823
you know,

301
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,400
we,

302
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,400
we started carrying things like kettle
bells and battle ropes and we're going to

303
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,210
continue to supply the craziest
fitness shit we can get our hands on.

304
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,280
What probably club bells
when moving to those next.

305
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,260
Those are pretty bad ass.

306
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,153
We use those.

307
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,400
I just started doing those.

308
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,240
You know,

309
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,080
you do those,

310
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,890
that shield casting over the shoulders.

311
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,220
Fantastic for the wrists and the forearms
and great for functional strength.

312
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,420
So what we'll probably get involved in
club bells eventually to all the stuff we

313
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:05,601
use.

314
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,500
Those stuff that would improve your,

315
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:08,870
your,

316
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,020
your strength and your conditioning if
you doing like Jujitsu or any kind of

317
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:12,854
athletics.

318
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,590
It's all just about a shit
for functional strength.

319
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,050
If you use the code name Rogan,

320
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,730
you will save 10 percent
off any and all supplements,

321
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:20,650
including camp force.

322
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,810
We have hemp force protein powder
that's made out of raw hemp,

323
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,561
which by the way,

324
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:25,490
you can't grow in America.

325
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,620
Ha.

326
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,910
You can buy it from Colorado,

327
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,240
mate,

328
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,190
make marijuana legal this week.

329
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,510
They did that might today.

330
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,373
It's right.

331
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,280
The polls show that the federal
government coming to notify that.

332
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,780
Yeah.

333
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,470
Again,

334
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,200
have those concepts,

335
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,390
but you can't.

336
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:40,581
We,

337
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:40,871
we,

338
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:41,704
we sell hamp.

339
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,920
This hemp protein powder does not
make you test positive for marijuana.

340
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,780
It's completely non psychoactive.

341
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,320
It's just a related to it or the
male of the plan or whatever.

342
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:51,920
Um,

343
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,753
and um,

344
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,290
we have to buy it from Canada.

345
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,260
We can't grow it here.

346
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,760
It's fucking so ridiculous.

347
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,320
I guess because people would just grow.

348
00:08:58,321 --> 00:08:59,140
We'd go to it.

349
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,510
I totally thought I was going home.

350
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,770
I didn't even know.

351
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,261
Did you hear,

352
00:09:02,261 --> 00:09:05,650
I heard somebody already told me last
night that somebody from Israel found out

353
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:09,490
the way a way to take out like
the highness out of marijuana.

354
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,900
So you're just getting the CBDS.

355
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,660
What a jerk.

356
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:15,220
That rarely Jewish.

357
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,810
Why would,

358
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,360
why would it,

359
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,650
why?

360
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,190
Like I'm just,

361
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:18,431
Hey,

362
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:19,010
I want to make.

363
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,170
We're not as fun.

364
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,700
Instead of doing cancer research,

365
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm just gonna ruin
everybody's fucking life.

366
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,641
Well,

367
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:25,280
the idea,

368
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,750
Brian,

369
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,021
is it.

370
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:28,000
Some people just want to
be healed from cancer,

371
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,870
they don't want to get high,

372
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,670
so you're like,

373
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,050
you'll be getting high is more
important than your cancer.

374
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:32,884
Silly,

375
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,940
but that's not true.

376
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,631
For some people.

377
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:35,830
They don't want to get the paranoia.

378
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:37,060
They just want to cure their diseases.

379
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,710
Combined.

380
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,280
Combined,

381
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,550
it combats nausea and lowers
interocular pressure while coma.

382
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,030
That's why glaucoma patients ticket,

383
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,953
is that right?

384
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,060
Anyway,

385
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,751
that Hampshire,

386
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,800
we've got to get it from Canada.

387
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:48,401
It's not cheap,

388
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:49,720
but if you buy a Blendtec blender,

389
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:50,554
you get a free one.

390
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,903
Boom.

391
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,880
Codename Rogan saves you 10 percent
off any and all supplements.

392
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,141
This weekend.

393
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,040
Balboa theater,

394
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,420
Joey Diaz and me,

395
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,130
that is this Saturday night.

396
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,020
Fucking very fired up about that.

397
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:02,830
I can't wait.

398
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,000
San Diego's shit.

399
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,640
I will be able to tell him this weekend,

400
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,990
Friday,

401
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,180
Portland really?

402
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,030
You can get your tickets
at helium comedy club,

403
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,520
that fucking club crackles clubs ever.

404
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,301
If you're in Philly,

405
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:16,940
come see me.

406
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,370
Helium,

407
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,030
philly.

408
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,770
Philly is one of the greatest cities
ever because it's the perfect combination

409
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:22,990
of smart people who
will fucking punch you.

410
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,480
Yeah,

411
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:23,910
yeah,

412
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,550
yeah.

413
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,920
There's always a palpable
aggression in the air.

414
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,220
Yeah,

415
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,240
that's very Boston.

416
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,880
Like every was a football
player like Michael Irvin.

417
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,390
I go,

418
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:31,661
what?

419
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:32,500
What were the worst fans?

420
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,393
Philly,

421
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:33,971
philly.

422
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:35,080
He hurt his neck in Philly.

423
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:35,680
They booed him.

424
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:35,960
They're like,

425
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,341
Beau.

426
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,020
Usually they clapped and I gotta get off.

427
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,110
Do you remember that?

428
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,420
If I can start the commercial,

429
00:10:40,421 --> 00:10:41,060
Brian,

430
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,530
stop it.

431
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,730
Stopped the commercial over.

432
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,170
Start the podcast.

433
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,850
We're going to just do it.

434
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,770
There's nothing else to talk about.

435
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,120
Death Squad dot TV.

436
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,680
Go Get yourself a kitty cat tee shirt.

437
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,290
You're Fox experience.

438
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,041
We always do this.

439
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,600
Do we have these conversations?

440
00:11:03,601 --> 00:11:04,434
And they go from,

441
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,670
I have a just a shitty.

442
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,170
I'm married to this method
of doing commercials.

443
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:08,820
Like,

444
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,450
yeah,

445
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,470
well sometimes it's okay,

446
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,281
but other times I'm like,

447
00:11:11,281 --> 00:11:11,640
wait,

448
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,550
this is 20 minutes of a
commercial that we're not always.

449
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:14,890
It's

450
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:15,850
conversations to.

451
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,290
Yeah.

452
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,180
It would be nice if I could
figure out how short net,

453
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,600
but the problem is then it weaves itself
into conversations that would make like

454
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:23,434
great podcasts.

455
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,980
We should just do commercials
in the middle of the podcast.

456
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,770
Yeah,

457
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,940
I think it's great the way you do it.

458
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,260
Does anybody else do?

459
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,153
Most guys,

460
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,650
they stop and read it in the
middle of their podcasts.

461
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,630
I just people doing it.

462
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,661
I like the way you do it,

463
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:38,710
which is organically get into it and the
problem is sometimes it goes into other

464
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:39,461
conversations.

465
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:41,230
You don't want it to be
a part of the commercial.

466
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,720
Here's what I liked that you believe
in every product you endorsed.

467
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,880
Well that's where we're lucky as shit.

468
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,590
Not like an advertisement is what I mean.

469
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,610
The only things that we're we're being
advertised by right now is all like,

470
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,420
like ting,

471
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,830
which was an awesome company.

472
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,030
No contracts the way we went
with them because they're like,

473
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,871
they use sprints,

474
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,530
backbone,

475
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,060
so they have like really good service,

476
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,710
but you can just cancel.

477
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,410
You couldn't make joint accounts like
you and I could share an account which

478
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,244
share minutes.

479
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,660
If you don't use your minutes,

480
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:12,040
like say if you use like what a lower
priced thing would be instead of what you

481
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,820
paid for.

482
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,890
Well then you get discounted
on your next bill.

483
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,710
It's like they are like
super ethical and fair,

484
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,700
so that's why we went with them.

485
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,860
But when you,

486
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,380
when you're involved in a wow,

487
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,720
like the podcast is weird enough as it is,

488
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:28,810
so it's like big companies probably
wouldn't want to get involved with it.

489
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,020
So it allows you to choose from people
that are like taking chances like the

490
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,910
ting people or the people or.

491
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,640
I think what's really unique
about it is the fact that you can,

492
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,700
you can pinpoint exactly who your niche
audiences if you're talking to very

493
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,410
specific people that are gonna
that are interested in it.

494
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,221
Yeah.

495
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,010
Well you know,

496
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,843
and it,

497
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,230
it,

498
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,380
it changes that audience a little bit
too as they see the excitement and other

499
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:50,651
shit.

500
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:50,920
I mean,

501
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,390
one of the cool things about hovering
cool friends is that you get to find out

502
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:57,220
about cool things and they're into that.

503
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,240
Maybe you didn't know.

504
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,800
When you talk to somebody,

505
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:01,780
like if you say like if you did not talk,

506
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,550
if you never knew about Jujitsu and you
were hanging out with Eddie Bravo and

507
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,384
then you just,

508
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,330
you really had no idea and you're talking
to this guy and then all of a sudden

509
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,520
he starts telling you about Jujitsu
and when it's like you'd be like,

510
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
there's a whole thing I
didn't even know about.

511
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,394
That's awesome.

512
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,960
Holy Shit like it.

513
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,420
It invigorates you and fires you up.

514
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,600
You know?

515
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,660
I think that's the biggest thing is like
the one of the problems with staying in

516
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,560
one place your whole life is
you limit your exposure to,

517
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,463
to everything.

518
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,853
Nowadays though,

519
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,320
the good news is you can be in one place
and expose yourself to everything if

520
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:33,190
you know where to look.

521
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,910
You know?

522
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,990
That never used to be the case.

523
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,620
The world is so much different now than
when we were like getting out of high

524
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:41,090
school.

525
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:41,710
It's so.

526
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,850
I mean it's not even.

527
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,200
It's like we were living in the dark age.

528
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,310
It really is because you're
constantly exposed a little bit.

529
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:52,690
Like if you look at how wrestling was be
in the eighties and then when the wall

530
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,010
came down in the eastern Europeans,

531
00:13:54,011 --> 00:13:56,290
the Russians and they came over
and shared all their secrets.

532
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,520
Wrestling even at that high school
level was so completely different.

533
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:02,110
A lot of ways than it was way back.

534
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:02,261
I mean,

535
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,980
as in certain things just didn't work
or they had answers to so many different

536
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:08,860
things and wrestling
technique and for that matter,

537
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:13,120
look at Jujitsu as everybody starts
experimenting and stuff and there's direct

538
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:13,990
access to it.

539
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,210
Things grow exponentially.

540
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:16,570
They get,

541
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,291
they seem to,

542
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:17,680
um,

543
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,420
become more,

544
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:18,580
uh,

545
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,900
exponentially complex.

546
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:20,351
I don't know,

547
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:21,190
it makes our life better,

548
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,600
but I think it does well.

549
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:24,010
I just think it's unavoidable.

550
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,810
Just seems to be that's the way
it just goes with everything.

551
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,710
And there's great from the
past and all endeavors,

552
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:32,920
but it standup comedy in fighting.

553
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,190
I don't think anybody from
the past truly holds up.

554
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,350
I know if I look at like a Joe Lewis,

555
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,750
and I imagine what would happen
if Joe Lewis had a flight?

556
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,950
Vladimir Klitschko,

557
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,460
I'd be like,

558
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,293
Jesus,

559
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,240
that's not.

560
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,020
Even though he's Klitschkos
barely a human right,

561
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,410
and he's totally new species of humans,

562
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:49,720
right?

563
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,010
Six foot seven,

564
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,650
250 pounds of shredded muscle.

565
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,590
Who's got a doctorate maybe to,

566
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,420
you know,

567
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,050
like smart as shit.

568
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,890
Overachiever,

569
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,160
man.

570
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,200
Just completely boxing your face in,

571
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,010
you know,

572
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,570
it doesn't take any stupid chances.

573
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,060
Just keeps fucking punching you in
the face and you can't punch him.

574
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,583
Good Luck Joe.

575
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,510
Get out there and do it for America.

576
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,440
He's a Nazi.

577
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,274
That Klitschko.

578
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,240
Go get them.

579
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,074
Joe Lewis.

580
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,030
Joe Lewis will get fucked up,

581
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:17,750
dude.

582
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,261
The only guy.

583
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,780
I think there's a few guys like Ali of
course would have been great in error.

584
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,693
Any error,

585
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,930
but I always said that.

586
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,460
Put it Mike Tyson against Ali.

587
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:26,900
Mike Tyson would have stormed them.

588
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,321
Well yeah,

589
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,310
but what he said is this,

590
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,320
Ali said boxing.

591
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:30,771
People will say,

592
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:31,604
yeah,

593
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,870
Tyson would have gotten,

594
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,390
would a storm to maybe the first
time because he's so powerful.

595
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,290
And guess what?

596
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,550
When they fought the second time,

597
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,030
Ali would have figured
them out that maybe,

598
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,820
maybe,

599
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,400
maybe the way by the way he'd be.

600
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,960
Remember Ali took,

601
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,220
it was 220 pounds,

602
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,700
right?

603
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,920
Which is a big man
without lifting a big man.

604
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:49,611
Oh,

605
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:50,360
and by the way,

606
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,140
he also fought I think nine rounds
against frazier with a broken jaw.

607
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,260
The dude could take punish.

608
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:57,140
That was Ken Norton.

609
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,580
I'm sorry.

610
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,413
But if you watch,

611
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,610
if you watch what frazier didn't,

612
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,640
those amazing fights.

613
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:02,120
Yeah.

614
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,421
And,

615
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,810
and the hooks and just landing in his
face and he just kept fighting and he took

616
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,400
into such incredible punishment and I
think his ability to kind of rope and,

617
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,780
and move with shots with a
huge part of it for sure.

618
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,790
Smarter than anybody
and got into your head,

619
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,480
you know,

620
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,470
look what he did to Sonny Liston.

621
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,570
He realized something listened was
the strongest man in the world.

622
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,700
They said the one thing sending listens,

623
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,330
afraid of is a crazy person.

624
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
Sonny's afraid of gravel,

625
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,611
crazy person.

626
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,041
And when,

627
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,410
when he did that weigh in,

628
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,740
sunny actually said,

629
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,441
keep them away from me.

630
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,490
I think he's going to bite me.

631
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,260
He was afraid he was going to get bit.

632
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,790
I just think skill wise,

633
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,930
I think Ali was great,

634
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,930
but if you look at the Ali from
like the Joe Frazier fight on,

635
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,490
if you compare that guy to Tyson when
he was against like say Michael spinks

636
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,710
when he was just the ultimate destroyer,

637
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,310
he was just too.

638
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,920
He was too blindingly fast
and a really good box,

639
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:50,180
unbelievably fast.

640
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:52,990
That was the thing that people missed and
the whole thing and they were like his

641
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,391
power.

642
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,530
Of course he had great power,

643
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,450
but it was the way he delivered it.

644
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,490
He delivered it like half as fast,

645
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,391
like really?

646
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:04,030
Like he was twice as fast as like the
Tony tubs is of the world of the Pink

647
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,040
Lynn.

648
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,670
Tom.

649
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,121
He fought,

650
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:05,661
raised her run.

651
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:07,760
I can raise a Ruckus is the biggest,

652
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,460
strongest looking man.

653
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,090
Dude,

654
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:10,610
man.

655
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,200
He was hitting him in the forehead with,

656
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,480
with hooks and sending him like,

657
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,120
like for sitting down in the air,

658
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,680
like fool now now run a got back up.

659
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:20,630
But finding the ref was like,

660
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,560
I'm stopping this because somebody's
going to lose their brain.

661
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,041
Yeah.

662
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:30,041
He was like a few years where
he was just unbelievably good.

663
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,810
But I think that's the
case with basketball.

664
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:35,150
I think that's the case with baseball.

665
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:38,650
I think it's the case with all sports
that everything just gets better and it's

666
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,810
really fascinating and
training techniques,

667
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,640
not just steroids.

668
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,460
Yeah,

669
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,680
that's the big designer drugs
when they can jean dope,

670
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:46,720
you wonder what you're.

671
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,950
You know you're going to have 400
pound Predator nationally athletes,

672
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,500
so then it becomes 100 percent.

673
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,101
It's on the way.

674
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:53,910
I can't wait.

675
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,050
They're going to keep getting bigger.

676
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,940
Like if you ever met like a real giant
pro football player and say I saw a real

677
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,160
law who was really rowdy and he
was like at this club in Phoenix,

678
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,970
and it was like a guy who's around
a bunch of kids who will just like,

679
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:06,331
all right,

680
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:07,200
settle down,

681
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,831
settle down,

682
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,690
let me throw.

683
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:09,960
It's exactly how it was.

684
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:11,480
Almost like a silver back on that.

685
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:11,730
Boom.

686
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,560
He was gigantic.

687
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,550
The dude was at least 400 pounds
and he wasn't fat athletic.

688
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:17,821
Yeah.

689
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,330
I was like,

690
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,520
I can't believe that's a fucking man.

691
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,380
Rich incognito.

692
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,610
I met at the playboy mansion,

693
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,810
six foot four,

694
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,711
300,

695
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,670
five pounds.

696
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,370
All Blonde.

697
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,170
Silverback,

698
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,320
she belonged to get and literally
doesn't even look like he lifts his says

699
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,210
everything is proportioned.

700
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:33,960
His head,

701
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,830
his shoulders,

702
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:35,690
his hips.

703
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:35,900
No.

704
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,720
Who was one of the scariest
guys that didn't get his duke.

705
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,010
He came on with the wrong time.

706
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,450
Do you remember Tom Erickson?

707
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,160
Who?

708
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Tom Big Cat Erickson fighter
fucking wrestler was 300 pounds now.

709
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,364
Natural.

710
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,720
Gigantic.

711
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:53,410
No,

712
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:53,570
no,

713
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,910
that was Paul varlands.

714
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,410
What did they call Tom?

715
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,360
I don't remember what they're called,

716
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,690
but he was a peace dude.

717
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,070
This guy rich on cognitive.

718
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,340
I said,

719
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,671
what are you?

720
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:03,480
What do you squat?

721
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:03,781
He goes,

722
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:04,321
I don't know.

723
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,670
I mean in the eights,

724
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:08,130
I think a big cats.

725
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,830
That's what it was.

726
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,590
Big Name nickname.

727
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,130
Big Cat.

728
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,110
Because he was a big dude.

729
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,060
He moved like a cat.

730
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,740
That's ridiculous.

731
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,960
He was Tom Erickson,

732
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:15,880
who was just speaking a big

733
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,821
Russian guy.

734
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm the wolf man.

735
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,870
Carolyn.

736
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,190
No,

737
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,380
no,

738
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:21,491
no,

739
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:21,660
no,

740
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:21,811
no.

741
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:22,644
Forget him.

742
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,760
That guy's legendary.

743
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,160
The last time we lost,

744
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,890
he was 16 years old and then a rulon
gardner beat him by based on one of the

745
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:29,461
mistakes you've made.

746
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,480
I saw the match.

747
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:30,701
Well,

748
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:31,230
it's funny.

749
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,500
That was like a new rule when you
get a guy to separate their hands.

750
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,800
It's one point when he won
the Olympic gold against,

751
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,270
uh,

752
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,500
uh,

753
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,590
with the Persian American,

754
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,810
a wrestler who was that who
would wrestle him 19 times.

755
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:43,644
I've never beat him.

756
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,120
And as he was winning the gold,

757
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,970
he had him and he was
whispering in his ear,

758
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,080
he was whispering and
essentially English saying,

759
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,520
you can never beat me.

760
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,560
It's not possible for
you to beat me to saying,

761
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:57,770
yeah.

762
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,610
So something like that.

763
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,130
And if you see when,

764
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,490
when they are awesome,

765
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,300
when he's,

766
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,920
when he had the silver medal and he did
meet and he had a silver medal in the

767
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:09,380
Olympics and he's up there
and somebody gave me,

768
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,010
gave me his name and he's crying.

769
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,520
He's crying because he just
realizes that no matter what he did,

770
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,990
no matter how hard he trains,

771
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,340
there is that man named corral
and that he will never beat.

772
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,520
He was born.

773
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,400
He was 15 pounds six for 305 pounds.

774
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,840
That's how much you weighed.

775
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,290
He trained

776
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,850
in Siberia.

777
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:31,380
The fuck is that.

778
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,590
While he was 15 pounds when he
was born and he has small parents,

779
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,580
his parents were splitting,

780
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,440
I think his grandfather or someone was a,

781
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,191
was a bear,

782
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:38,461
you know,

783
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,330
some giant guy.

784
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,640
Carolyn was also me and a very,

785
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,870
very serious competitor.

786
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:45,630
Like a main competitor would not lose.

787
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:45,831
No,

788
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:46,021
no.

789
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,520
And would play games you and talk to you.

790
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,080
And by the way,

791
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,200
you know why he got really why he got
really famous and we started hearing about

792
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:55,870
him is he would suplex
people and break their necks.

793
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,020
He'd suplex you and drop you on your
neck and that's where people were just so

794
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:03,520
afraid of him and he was just too strong.

795
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,780
He would get guys.

796
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,340
They would literally completely flattened
themselves out on the mat to try to

797
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,720
resist being taken down.

798
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,290
They didn't even try to scramble because
if he scrambled and he caught you in

799
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:14,771
the scramble,

800
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,890
he'd have you elevated and just
fucking pile drive you on your head.

801
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,640
It's crazy.

802
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,350
He would pick them up as
they were flattening up and
he was 300 plus pound men

803
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,680
and from like a lying down 300 pound man
to be able to pick him up with a gable

804
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,600
grip and hoist him up in the air.

805
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,460
Most people have no idea how
strong you'd have to be so weird.

806
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,520
Like you would have a hard time
doing that with a small child.

807
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,220
Like most people would have a hard time,

808
00:21:41,221 --> 00:21:42,790
but he was also very flexible.

809
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,490
He was also like,

810
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,340
he was just a huge mongoose.

811
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,001
Exactly.

812
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:49,390
He wasn't like a big stupid like
power lifter looking due to.

813
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,224
Couldn't move.

814
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:50,861
No,

815
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,480
he was like a big giant was all back
back and traps in relation to his chest.

816
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,470
It wasn't bodybuilder,

817
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,930
his knees and his hips and his.

818
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,040
There's a famous photo of him hoisting
a guy up in the air and he's just got

819
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,570
this look of rage and he.

820
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,910
He's so terrible.

821
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,130
It just like embodied those Cold War
Olympics where everybody was afraid of the

822
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,303
Russian

823
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,393
champagne.

824
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,281
Shut it down.

825
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:17,560
He was like the real draco but better.

826
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,700
That's exactly right.

827
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,300
There's a fault.

828
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,650
I got to pull up this photo.

829
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:21,510
I think our boy,

830
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:22,011
uh,

831
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:22,340
um,

832
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,780
uh,

833
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,280
Oh God,

834
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,113
um,

835
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,330
the Russian,

836
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,830
the great Russian MMA fighter.

837
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,210
I'm a fit fit or this or
he has a little of that,

838
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,530
but he's like a little bit more.

839
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,180
He's not as.

840
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,013
Or is it different?

841
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,913
It's a different thing.

842
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,411
Brian.

843
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,230
Pull.

844
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,090
Pull this up,

845
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,280
pull up Alexander Curl,

846
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,330
pull up Carolyn,

847
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:43,270
and there's a photo of him
with a teacher's going,

848
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,420
oh dude.

849
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,550
It's just is.

850
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,440
I can look at that photo.

851
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:51,071
See that photo?

852
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,030
That's the one we're looking for.

853
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:52,451
I see that.

854
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:52,780
Let me see.

855
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:52,901
Oh,

856
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,010
I haven't actually seen that one.

857
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,530
K A r e l l I n.

858
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,040
Oh my God.

859
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,821
It's so fucking.

860
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:01,180
Oh my God.

861
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,500
He's got this photo of him.

862
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,510
About to throw this guy for the air.

863
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,573
Look at him and me.

864
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,611
He's the hulk.

865
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:07,660
Come one 70.

866
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,830
That's the real hulk.

867
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,843
He's like the real hockey.

868
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,450
Doesn't even have a mouthpiece in sending
even wearing a mouthpiece as fucking

869
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:14,284
animal horse.

870
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,050
He's wrestling children.

871
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,350
What are they going to do?

872
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:21,190
Fat in his live fucking
wrestling shoulder.

873
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,361
He's wrestling.

874
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:22,650
Chill.

875
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,230
We're to be that much better at something
and everybody else that's just that

876
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,064
much bigger than.

877
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,950
I mean it's better,

878
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:27,790
but not much bigger.

879
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,920
Like that guy was ridiculously busy.

880
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,690
Arguably in some ways the toughest,

881
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:32,530
strongest man in the world.

882
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,430
I mean if you get a photo of it,

883
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,500
it's got to be somebody fucking windows.

884
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,041
Oh,

885
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:36,840
it crashed.

886
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,080
Why are we still using the

887
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,760
picture?

888
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,300
Who is a terrifying dude?

889
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,100
Who is so God damn.

890
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,253
Yeah.

891
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,520
You went to a guy that have done it.

892
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,460
I should have pinged it.

893
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,490
Look at all these heroin dogs.

894
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,770
Fighting is different to those.

895
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,350
I mean.

896
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:55,830
Yeah.

897
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,320
Well whenever strikes.

898
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:58,820
Yeah,

899
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,470
it's a different.

900
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,290
It neutralizes a lot of stuff.

901
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,540
This is not the guy you're looking for.

902
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:03,871
No,

903
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:04,021
no,

904
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:04,201
no,

905
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:04,381
no,

906
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:04,950
no.

907
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,270
It's spelled K,

908
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,510
r e l I n his name is Alexander Alexander.

909
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:10,344
Corella.

910
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,493
Okay.

911
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:13,560
Yes.

912
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,393
It's awful.

913
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,320
What Bang edits.

914
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,871
Dog Change.

915
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,051
No,

916
00:24:16,051 --> 00:24:16,700
I don't want to bring.

917
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,640
It was just kidding.

918
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:18,474
I would never do that.

919
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,311
Yeah,

920
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:20,144
that's the dude.

921
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,290
Go to images

922
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,450
and no one down with him and the
tank top gritting his teeth to that.

923
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,453
On that shit man.

924
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,510
What the fuck did at the arms on him?

925
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,383
This was.

926
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,843
Are you kidding?

927
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:33,841
That is.

928
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:35,110
So look at that.

929
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,430
Oh,

930
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,110
that's so weird.

931
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,210
It's so scary.

932
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,720
His forearms and his.

933
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,530
Oh,

934
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,071
look at his.

935
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,840
The ferocity and his eyes.

936
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:45,630
Looking at this joker face joker face.

937
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,820
Craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.

938
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,690
That was the real deal.

939
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,540
Now that is a naked gorilla.

940
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,560
That was the real deal.

941
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,210
There's a full photo of that too.

942
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:55,440
Where you get to see his full body.

943
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:56,280
It's even spookier.

944
00:24:56,281 --> 00:24:57,550
Brian pulled up,

945
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,860
got back to the,

946
00:24:58,861 --> 00:24:58,981
uh,

947
00:24:58,981 --> 00:24:59,820
there's a full photo.

948
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,530
You see his fucking legs go,

949
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,280
scroll up,

950
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,761
scroll up.

951
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:03,240
Were there.

952
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,770
I would always know that son is always
where a single let in that this is an

953
00:25:07,771 --> 00:25:11,070
even better one way is the
whole entire body up there.

954
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:11,451
Then yeah,

955
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:11,820
that's it.

956
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,653
Click on this.

957
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,553
Look at this shit.

958
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,321
This,

959
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:15,180
this is big.

960
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,340
This is completely ridiculous.

961
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,300
When you see the actual full image
and you get his fucking legs,

962
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,193
look at that.

963
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,210
What the fuck man?

964
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,530
What is he saying?

965
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,423
Lord,

966
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,291
Lord,

967
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,990
I'm producing estrogens are insane.

968
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,060
That's insane how big his legs guys.

969
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,410
But Dude,

970
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,300
that poor guy is going to a ragdoll mid,

971
00:25:39,301 --> 00:25:40,140
poor that poor guy.

972
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:40,410
So.

973
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:40,830
Okay.

974
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,820
So here's the question,

975
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,690
what is he a 100 percent roids like
there's something going on there.

976
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,920
I think I would suggest that it's genetic.

977
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:53,940
If you're born at 15 pounds and if you
look at our proportion is body is and the

978
00:25:53,941 --> 00:25:55,110
amount of training he does.

979
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,260
There are people out there that are
genetic freaks that don't need steroids.

980
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:58,560
Yeah.

981
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,011
But you know what?

982
00:25:59,011 --> 00:25:59,641
I bet it is.

983
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,920
I bet it's both because this was Russia.

984
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,780
Russia was not fucking around back then.

985
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,090
That's,

986
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:04,500
you know,

987
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,320
we had victor content on the podcast and
one of the things that he was talking

988
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:11,370
about is that the elephant in the room
when it comes to women's track and field

989
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:14,580
is that there was a period of time
where before they were testing were they

990
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:18,390
still cannot achieve the results
that these eastern bloc women got.

991
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:18,901
Really?

992
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:19,141
Yeah.

993
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:22,980
Like this world records and no one comes
close when they win the Olympics every

994
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:23,280
year.

995
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,113
And he's like,

996
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,421
well,

997
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:25,141
they just can't.

998
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,120
They can't achieve what these men,

999
00:26:27,121 --> 00:26:27,930
women did.

1000
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,430
So because they just a matter of
record or it's just what their times,

1001
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:32,530
their ties to the top.

1002
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:32,860
No,

1003
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,693
the Times they,

1004
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,940
the Times that they had from 10,

1005
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,300
20 years ago from whatever it was were
they weren't testing with these women

1006
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,390
that times were stronger than they are
today in the Olympics that they are

1007
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,100
behind

1008
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,220
the gold metal or behind the world.

1009
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,740
Brexit,

1010
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,610
no idea about that.

1011
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,121
Well,

1012
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:50,220
he said it's 100 percent because
they were taking steroids.

1013
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,330
He was a fascinating guy to have on
because he fucking saw the whole thing

1014
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:55,650
happened from the ground up.

1015
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,191
You know,

1016
00:26:56,191 --> 00:27:00,240
he saw people like experimenting with
all these different supplements and you

1017
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:00,421
know,

1018
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:00,611
he,

1019
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:01,940
he saw and he,

1020
00:27:01,941 --> 00:27:06,870
and he's seen track and field athletes
like all the sudden get unbelievably

1021
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:07,201
good.

1022
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:08,040
Like within a year.

1023
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,360
And everybody was suspicious.

1024
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:09,930
Yeah.

1025
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,980
She's a perfect example,

1026
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,490
but he's a,

1027
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:12,850
you know,

1028
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,760
he's of the opinion that they all do it.

1029
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,050
Especially track and field.

1030
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,760
He said all those guys are on something.

1031
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,270
Yeah.

1032
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,451
Well,

1033
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:18,561
the,

1034
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:18,931
you know,

1035
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:20,460
one of the raises the question too,

1036
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:23,460
because they took two of the
top fastest guys in the world,

1037
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,770
I think it was Justin Gatlin
and then Maurice Greene.

1038
00:27:25,771 --> 00:27:26,604
I think those are.

1039
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,070
And what they found was that he was
talking about steroids and he said,

1040
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:29,860
look,

1041
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,410
the Maurice Greene naturally has
800 grams or 600 grams of protein,

1042
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,490
would not grams a 600,

1043
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:37,220
uh,

1044
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,860
uh,

1045
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,860
whatever that measurement per per gram
of blood at 800 you're testosterone at.

1046
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,980
Whereas someone like
Justin Gatlin has 400,

1047
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,460
so naturally occurring,

1048
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,620
some people have just more testosterone
and usually guys were faster and stuff

1049
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,390
stronger.

1050
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:51,711
Well,

1051
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,081
we'll then,

1052
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,070
what does that say about.

1053
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,330
So if that's the case,

1054
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,080
is it a fair competition or can this
other guy take hormone replacement therapy

1055
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,990
and bring his up to $800 right there.

1056
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,650
There's where you get into these weird,

1057
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,100
weird questions that the,

1058
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:05,340
the argument for steroids,

1059
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,040
you can eat foods that
increase your testosterone.

1060
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,390
So,

1061
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,080
so they do it very marginally.

1062
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:10,680
Maybe,

1063
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,750
but so where do we draw the line?

1064
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,940
Like if the technology exists,

1065
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,350
it's,

1066
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,590
it's,

1067
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,470
it's a murky,

1068
00:28:16,471 --> 00:28:17,370
it's a murky issue,

1069
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:17,880
right?

1070
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,780
It does get murky.

1071
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,670
If you want to consider
a level playing field,

1072
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,310
there is no level playing field
because we have ectomorphs,

1073
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,340
endomorphs and Meza more's being the
body types of ectomorphs are ones who are

1074
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:28,861
really skinny.

1075
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,530
You can't gain any weight endomorph,

1076
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,900
so the really fat ones have a hard time
losing weight or Mesomorphs are those

1077
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:35,250
Wesley Snipes looking dudes?

1078
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,000
Just look.

1079
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,890
Just ripped and muscular.

1080
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,580
You look at Mike Tyson,

1081
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:42,900
classic Mesomorph,

1082
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,260
you know,

1083
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,320
classically muscular.

1084
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:44,850
Yeah.

1085
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,270
That certain people that just
Bruno Shapes for Cheick Kongo,

1086
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,210
the extreme force,

1087
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:51,780
you,

1088
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,201
you know,

1089
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:52,451
you,

1090
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:53,071
you can't.

1091
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:55,590
Some people can never
achieve that physical frame.

1092
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:56,011
They just,

1093
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:57,090
they can't naturally.

1094
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,360
So what is the what if a pill came along
and all of a sudden you turn some dude

1095
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:03,594
who's got

1096
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,100
Ralphie may's genetics and all of a sudden

1097
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,570
the problem then becomes that competition
is all about the best chemist.

1098
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,290
I can understand the argument steroids
because total now that we all know that

1099
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:16,891
human beings,

1100
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:17,750
if they want to win something,

1101
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,020
they'll do everything including sacrifice
their own health to get to a point in

1102
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:21,390
time,

1103
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,620
but then there's a guy like chlorella
and it doesn't matter what the fuck you

1104
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,961
do.

1105
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:28,230
It's like there's certain dudes where
there's so much of a physical gift.

1106
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,630
It's almost impossible
for you to overcome it.

1107
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,540
There's that.

1108
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,811
There's a level,

1109
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:36,060
like the idea is that if a
person is super athletic,

1110
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:37,260
that can't be smart as well.

1111
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,250
That's not true,

1112
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,263
unfortunately.

1113
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,090
Unfortunately that guy can fuck
you and probably beat you in chess.

1114
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,790
Chess,

1115
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,170
yeah.

1116
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,320
It's just because someone
is big and athletic,

1117
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:48,810
like that's a terrifying
thing for someone.

1118
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Someone who's intellectually dual them
and still kick their ass and named Mark

1119
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,370
Court told me that GSP
is a great chess player,

1120
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,050
like a phenomenal chess player.

1121
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,390
GSP is an unusual human being.

1122
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,260
He's very,

1123
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,280
very bright guy.

1124
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,110
He's very open and honest.

1125
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,240
Like he's one of the rare fighters.

1126
00:30:06,241 --> 00:30:08,860
It talks about being scared and you
know what went through his head.

1127
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,400
Yeah.

1128
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:09,640
Yeah.

1129
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:09,941
He's,

1130
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,230
uh,

1131
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,460
you know,

1132
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,230
like about what makes them insecure and
apparently he's got this crazy thing

1133
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,160
about aliens.

1134
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,150
Oh No.

1135
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,870
Yeah,

1136
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,171
yeah.

1137
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,004
He's uh,

1138
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,320
he's terrified about aliens.

1139
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,110
I'm finding him in the middle
of the night and abducting him,

1140
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,300
but there are other things to worry about.

1141
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:30,301
Georgia has a path to get out of his
house in case of the len come to my house.

1142
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,250
He's got to be kidding.

1143
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,521
No,

1144
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:33,731
no.

1145
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,320
He really is obsessed with aliens.

1146
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:35,900
Really?

1147
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,110
Yeah.

1148
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,281
Yeah,

1149
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:36,551
yeah.

1150
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,190
It's so much so that they filmed a lot
of shit and they wouldn't even use it in

1151
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:39,851
the countdown show.

1152
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,200
I don't know who didn't like it.

1153
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,030
Dana or someone,

1154
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,580
you know,

1155
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,010
someone made a joke

1156
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,900
about it and it tell you about everything.

1157
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:50,560
I think it's ridiculous to not leave it
in because I think it's another little

1158
00:30:50,561 --> 00:30:51,610
layer and the guy's cake.

1159
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,750
The guys that used to look,

1160
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,920
he is a bonafide bad motherfucker
and anybody who thinks he isn't a bad

1161
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,110
motherfucker because
he is scared to death.

1162
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,900
It's so silly.

1163
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,090
He's George fucking cop.

1164
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,360
I let him tell his story.

1165
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,560
It's probably interesting.

1166
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,500
The aliens come from me in
the middle of the night,

1167
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,180
you know,

1168
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,980
I've had my acl repair.

1169
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:12,120
Hey,

1170
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,341
I'm.

1171
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:14,470
I hear through the
grapevine that Mr Nick Diaz,

1172
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:15,130
who I love,

1173
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,330
but my favorite fighter and a lot of
ways he wants to fight Mr Anderson Silva.

1174
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,081
Yeah,

1175
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:20,450
he'll fight.

1176
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,890
Anybody fight fate or he'll fight
anybody who doesn't give a fuck.

1177
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,900
He's a real fighter sting match.

1178
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:27,080
I think that

1179
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,920
Anderson would kick it,

1180
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,090
kick him in the face and all that,

1181
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:31,940
but it did.

1182
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,370
He's not afraid of his boxing.

1183
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,780
I mean he boxes a lot and I.

1184
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,820
It seems like he would be a guy who could
certainly stand and trade as opposed

1185
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:45,070
to him Damien Maia and and or
forest griffin doing with Anderson.

1186
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,930
I think that if anybody could actually,

1187
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,470
who's a pure boxer who trains with
real boxers and is a pretty good boxer,

1188
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,221
he might.

1189
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:54,040
He might be able to
answer ideas first of all,

1190
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,950
takes an unbelievable shot and
he could take a hell of a shot.

1191
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,510
He's super determined.

1192
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,531
No one's got wind.

1193
00:31:59,531 --> 00:31:59,951
Liked him.

1194
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:02,080
His endurance is preposterous.

1195
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,060
Endurance is completely preposterous.

1196
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,680
His,

1197
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,080
his endurance is preposterous.

1198
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,650
It is flip your swims back
from Alcatraz for like a Goof,

1199
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,210
so we're getting the ocean
and swims from Alcatraz,

1200
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,680
like his endurance is freakish
and that's one of his,

1201
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,010
one of his strengths and everybody's
got to be scared of that shit.

1202
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,960
But Anderson's never
showed endurance problems.

1203
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,690
He tapped Chilson in the
fifth round of a fight.

1204
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:28,900
He was getting his ass kicked in so
he's never had insurance problems.

1205
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:31,750
But I think that Nick Diaz is,

1206
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,780
he's a difficult to do to crack.

1207
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,201
You know,

1208
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:37,780
like you look at like really good
start because like Paul Daley,

1209
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,470
Paul Dale is a dangerous fucking strike.

1210
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,760
Decided to stand and trade with him.

1211
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,500
He's a much better rest.

1212
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,620
I haven't standard trade on.

1213
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:43,610
By the way you hit me with a left.

1214
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:44,210
Watch this.

1215
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,740
He goes down,

1216
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,060
gets up,

1217
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,740
Bang with the left will not only that,

1218
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,390
such a true fighter and I'm on the ground
and nick is so good at wrapping you up

1219
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,860
and you have to look
after that armbar man.

1220
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:52,700
That shit comes quick.

1221
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,710
He caught Cyborg and an Armbar Cyborg.

1222
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,221
Never saw that.

1223
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,620
Common Cyborg was blast
and him would lead.

1224
00:32:57,621 --> 00:32:58,080
Kicks to,

1225
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,913
but it didn't matter.

1226
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,450
It was like,

1227
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,940
it was almost like he was
just holding off the charge.

1228
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,990
Who just holding off the time.

1229
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:03,531
We'll get you.

1230
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:04,364
I'm gonna get.

1231
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,660
I'm gonna.

1232
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,500
Get some finally Cyborg.

1233
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,780
Like the pressure of
constantly coming at him.

1234
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,741
So I've walked into,

1235
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:10,340
and by the way,

1236
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,400
Kim down in nick had
them arm barred and like,

1237
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,243
no time.

1238
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,760
Yeah,

1239
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,660
he's an interesting dude.

1240
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,523
Physically,

1241
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,310
he's,

1242
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,600
he's smaller than Anderson,

1243
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:18,434
that's for sure.

1244
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:18,771
You know,

1245
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,540
he's fought at 55.

1246
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,891
He's got to walk around.

1247
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:22,724
What is it about six one?

1248
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,950
Dick is at least six feet tall.

1249
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:25,810
Six 1:10.

1250
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,620
Anyway,

1251
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,110
he ways he walks around.

1252
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,270
And what do you think?

1253
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,751
I don't know.

1254
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:30,710
He's pretty healthy,

1255
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:33,450
so he's not the type of dude
that would gain a lot of ways.

1256
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,060
He definitely never gets fat.

1257
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,760
He's like very strict.

1258
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,613
This diet.

1259
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,410
I think he's mostly Vegan.

1260
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:42,430
He's drinking Kombucha all
the time telling me that.

1261
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,210
Now I'm going to start
doing the Nick Diaz Diet.

1262
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,991
Well listen man,

1263
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:48,380
if you talk to guys like rich roll or
any of these like ultra endurance guys

1264
00:33:48,381 --> 00:33:49,020
like you know there's,

1265
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,760
there's no better way to keep your body
energized and constantly eating fresh

1266
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:53,421
vegetables,

1267
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:53,751
high,

1268
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:54,021
high,

1269
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:54,920
high carbohydrate,

1270
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,630
complex carbide.

1271
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:57,600
Yeah.

1272
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,850
I don't think for ultimate
performance though,

1273
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:01,670
for especially explosive performance,

1274
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:04,910
I don't think you get the same
results according to scientists.

1275
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:05,481
You know,

1276
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,480
the people that have actually done
studies shows that there really are some

1277
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,650
benefits to a complete.

1278
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,600
It's a complete protein.

1279
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,563
Yeah.

1280
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,760
The thing about being a Vegan
as you can get your protein,

1281
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:15,594
but it,

1282
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,310
I think the proteins at the end of the
day or whenever they start to cohesion,

1283
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,570
they sort of can't.

1284
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,910
They pick up where the
other ones left off.

1285
00:34:23,911 --> 00:34:27,600
So beans are one nuts have protein in
and you had enough of that you'll get a

1286
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:28,351
complete protein,

1287
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:31,980
but meat is a very calorie
dense energy dense,

1288
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,600
a complete protein.

1289
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,550
It's just better and most.

1290
00:34:35,551 --> 00:34:35,881
By the way,

1291
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:37,080
most most cultures,

1292
00:34:37,081 --> 00:34:38,760
and you know this from the guy you had on,

1293
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,470
I'm sure he talked about
it with the Paleo Diet,

1294
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,820
most hunter gatherer cultures,

1295
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:42,720
the way we came up,

1296
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,430
we were strictly carnivores.

1297
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,080
I mean,

1298
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,320
if you look at where we went hunting,

1299
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,850
try planting anything there,

1300
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:52,020
you would have had to
live off animal protein

1301
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,913
for the most part.

1302
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,970
There's a lot of parts.

1303
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,530
We were in Montana,

1304
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:56,520
we went hunting for this,

1305
00:34:56,521 --> 00:34:56,660
uh,

1306
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,780
Steven Rinella show.

1307
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,700
It's called the mediator.

1308
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,580
And the mediator is his second show.

1309
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:04,080
He had this other show that was on,

1310
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,143
um,

1311
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,200
I think it was on the travel channel.

1312
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,370
It's called the wild within.

1313
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:08,971
It was really cool.

1314
00:35:08,971 --> 00:35:09,751
Show where you go,

1315
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:12,480
like he went where Lewis
and Clark went and the,

1316
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:12,840
uh,

1317
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,200
a shot a moose and made a boat out of
the Moose and fucking shot loose with a

1318
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,210
musket and made a boat out of the Moose.

1319
00:35:18,211 --> 00:35:18,491
Yeah,

1320
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:18,601
yeah,

1321
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:18,851
yeah.

1322
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,010
I like the way they would have done it.

1323
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,910
It was really interesting.

1324
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,290
I make a bone out of a moose.

1325
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,060
So Brian and I went hunting with them.

1326
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,190
We went to a,

1327
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,270
I talked about it with
Ari Shaffir already,

1328
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,350
but we went to Montana to what used
to be the great inland Western,

1329
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,750
see the Great Western inland sea,

1330
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:35,280
which is fast willing to a part where he

1331
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,480
lewis and Clark said they,

1332
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,590
they as went through it,

1333
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:38,100
they were like,

1334
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,350
we think we saw some
signs of native Americans.

1335
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
I mean not even the native
Americans lived there,

1336
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:43,300
but it was a hunting role,

1337
00:35:43,301 --> 00:35:44,820
but you couldn't live there
because you could grow.

1338
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,080
Nothing crazy.

1339
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,240
I use also weird how
much ground we covered,

1340
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:51,300
like wake up really early in
the morning and then we'd,

1341
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,530
you'd go,

1342
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:52,921
he'd be like,

1343
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:53,850
we'll go over that ridge.

1344
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,240
I was like,

1345
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,950
that rich has a mountain range.

1346
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,240
Is it shit as far right.

1347
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,510
But you could actually climb it because
it was made a clay and it stuck to your

1348
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:00,890
feet,

1349
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,210
you know?

1350
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,620
Well it was really difficult when you're
on the edges because it was just so

1351
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,850
slippery and your feet would
waste so much because the,

1352
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:09,060
the bottoms would be caked with this shit.

1353
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,070
And I remember when I glassed the field,

1354
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:15,610
I'd take my binoculars and look out
for game glassing the field is a,

1355
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,220
as a hunting terminology,

1356
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,054
don't worry about it.

1357
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,590
And I'd be so out of breath,

1358
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:19,801
man,

1359
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,030
because we were high elevation.

1360
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,900
It was just like,

1361
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,820
it was a lot of hiking that.

1362
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,140
So you've got to be in fucking cheap,

1363
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:25,651
you know,

1364
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,810
I've watched this show and I've seen them,

1365
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,050
you know,

1366
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,790
what they do is stalking after the game.

1367
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,770
But I never really considered
how much actual walkers involved.

1368
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,990
He just,

1369
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:34,830
he doesn't get tired.

1370
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:35,431
I know,

1371
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:35,980
dude,

1372
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,190
I was fucking super impressed because uh,

1373
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,760
we were me and the camera
guys fucking out of breath.

1374
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,970
And Steve rebel is up their
truck and you're walking forever.

1375
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,511
Yeah.

1376
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:47,340
When you're walking up some serious hills.

1377
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,580
It's really interesting though.

1378
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,411
We were talking about this,

1379
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,580
that anything you do,

1380
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:51,900
even like hiking,

1381
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:52,770
if you're like,

1382
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:54,360
he's doing this every week.

1383
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:56,010
Every year he does it all year round.

1384
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:56,844
That's how he hunts.

1385
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,370
So he's like constantly hiking.

1386
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,730
The central nervous system learns how
to use your muscles more efficiently.

1387
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,540
Yeah,

1388
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,500
that's what we're talking about.

1389
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:05,101
Like every,

1390
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,300
anything you do with
martial arts or wrestling,

1391
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,600
why they tell you if
you want a bodybuilder,

1392
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:12,300
you gotta change it up because you confuse
your central nervous system so your

1393
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:14,820
body doesn't learn to use the
same muscles over and over again.

1394
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:15,320
Right?

1395
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,010
So now your body's like
confused and it goes,

1396
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:17,131
well,

1397
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:20,420
we got to use these muscles now and
you keep tearing the muscles down and I

1398
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:20,670
just,

1399
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,503
that's what I want.

1400
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,950
Can you just don't like the crossfit?

1401
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:24,210
People believe in that as well.

1402
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:24,841
That's like their,

1403
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,420
their ideas.

1404
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,390
You do some fitness fitness so
your body gets to a comprehensive,

1405
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,920
a strength,

1406
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,700
you know,

1407
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,190
sort of a all around kind
of controversial too though.

1408
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:39,170
The controversy behind the crossfit people
is that some people like steven that

1409
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,670
you should ever be doing power lifting
exercises with great reputations like

1410
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:42,800
that.

1411
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,100
It's like there's no way
they're designed for.

1412
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,470
They're designed for
big explosive movements,

1413
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:50,730
moving heavy things with correct form
and building up your core and your

1414
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,600
explosive power.

1415
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,000
Most of the people I know
did crossfit and get hurt.

1416
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:54,840
They get hurt.

1417
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,480
There's a lot of injuries and in fact a
lot of pro athletes that I've talked to

1418
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:59,850
don't do it as much because
first of all it's a little bit,

1419
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,320
it's so much.

1420
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:04,440
It's so much on your body that a lot
of times they weren't having energy for

1421
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,830
their practices or their games
and it keeps you torn down.

1422
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,550
Now there are some ridiculously fit
athletes and I think it's a great program,

1423
00:38:11,551 --> 00:38:13,530
but I try to do it as much as possible,

1424
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:17,820
but I do think that the athletes I've
talked to the fighters and even the

1425
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,720
football players are like,

1426
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:22,710
well you gotta you gotta you gotta
move at your own pace with that stuff.

1427
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,041
Yeah,

1428
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:23,401
you do.

1429
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,790
You can't try to keep up with those dudes
because those extreme crossfit dudes

1430
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:27,360
they get.

1431
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,100
They get like a deep,

1432
00:38:29,101 --> 00:38:29,401
deep,

1433
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:34,401
deep into the game to the point where
they can do just ridiculous sets with 225.

1434
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:39,360
They're clean and jerking for 20 reps and
then they're doing 20 chin ups grants.

1435
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,050
Yeah.

1436
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,020
They can do some sport.

1437
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,230
It's not like,

1438
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,063
you know,

1439
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,320
I'm sure that it's a test of will man.

1440
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,870
That is a test of will
at crossfits humbling.

1441
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:50,704
Every time you do it.

1442
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,850
Like if you do Fran,

1443
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:52,421
you know what Fran,

1444
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,890
his friend never gets easy.

1445
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,641
Like if I think about it,

1446
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:55,660
my heart starts beating fast.

1447
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:57,130
Where you got 95 pounds,

1448
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:58,420
you go into a squat thrust,

1449
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,283
you go squat,

1450
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,191
thrust her.

1451
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:01,840
So you go down in a squat position,

1452
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,580
throw it up over your head.

1453
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,870
You do that 21 times,

1454
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,280
go at 21 pull ups,

1455
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,750
15 thrusters,

1456
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:08,650
15 pull ups,

1457
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,640
nine thrusters,

1458
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:10,523
nine pull ups.

1459
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,291
And you know,

1460
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,670
the idea is if you could do a sub,

1461
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,950
if you it under three minutes
here in ridiculous shape,

1462
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,580
uh,

1463
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,660
but even doing it,

1464
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,080
try doing it in under seven or
eight and you'll be on the ground.

1465
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,040
It's just never.

1466
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:21,970
It never gets easy.

1467
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,240
They have so many of those things that
never get easy to so much you could do

1468
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:26,530
out there for exercise.

1469
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,423
It's amazing.

1470
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,870
You see most people at the gym,

1471
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,590
they're like,

1472
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,270
you're barely working out.

1473
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,690
You know,

1474
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,020
you might be doing curls.

1475
00:39:33,021 --> 00:39:34,570
Are doing some sets that you do though.

1476
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:34,990
What's your,

1477
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,920
how long is your workout?

1478
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:36,430
If you're lifting,

1479
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,190
it depends.

1480
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,410
Depends on what I'm doing.

1481
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,410
Depends on I started when I hurt my back,

1482
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:45,070
I started doing more isolation stuff
like rows and stuff like that just to

1483
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:48,280
really strengthen up my back so
that day is like an easy day.

1484
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,410
The the fullback day that I do,

1485
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:54,640
I do one full back day that's only
like 30 minutes quick workout,

1486
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,850
but just the whole idea is just to
blow it out and make it really hard.

1487
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:58,500
You know?

1488
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,180
I just,

1489
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,013
I want,

1490
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,270
I just want to have,

1491
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,340
be able to build up muscle and to have
explosive power so your body's got to be

1492
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:09,440
conditioned all the time
to be doing explosive shit,

1493
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,400
building up tissue exploding.

1494
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,030
And if you don't do that all the time,

1495
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,380
it doesn't want to do all the time.

1496
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:17,170
You'll have no situation in
life in which to explode.

1497
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,220
And we all know that.

1498
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:19,430
We use that every day.

1499
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,633
Funny,

1500
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,881
like I do all this stuff.

1501
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:22,121
I'm like,

1502
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,470
when am I ever going
to do doing kettlebell?

1503
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,430
Until I can't walk.

1504
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,580
Like what am I going to not.

1505
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,320
I'm not.

1506
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,670
I'm not bringing huge bells,

1507
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:28,360
but it doesn't matter.

1508
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,880
I like being in shape in
case the shit hits the fan.

1509
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,171
I wasn't in shape,

1510
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:33,190
but when we went on a hunting trip,

1511
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,750
we've assured I would have been fucked.

1512
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,320
Oh my God.

1513
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,250
Because that was.

1514
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,390
That was a series.

1515
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,570
We would hike at least
three miles in the morning.

1516
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,490
So funny dude.

1517
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,150
It was raining the first night we were
freezing and the sleeping bags they gave

1518
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,860
us didn't work and as I'm getting,

1519
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,790
I'm shivering and putting like
seven layers to down jackets.

1520
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:53,050
Literally I'm shivering.

1521
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,350
I just hear Jonas in his tank.

1522
00:40:55,351 --> 00:40:56,710
Go camping.

1523
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,580
Fucking laughed so hard
and somebody shoot.

1524
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:00,851
You did.

1525
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:01,684
I don't know why.

1526
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,740
He just goes camping below.

1527
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,440
We had a great fucking time.

1528
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,620
How about me pulling fucking
quilts out of your ass and legs?

1529
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:09,510
I think we have on tape.

1530
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,040
We still have these red marks
all over my ass and legs.

1531
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,250
I laid down on a cactus and Brian had
a pull them out in the camp for the

1532
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:18,680
campfire with all the guys.

1533
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,781
All the guys were like,

1534
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,291
what are you doing?

1535
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:20,501
I'm like,

1536
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,510
I don't waste my fucking,

1537
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,061
my best friend.

1538
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:22,894
I got to pull out.

1539
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,760
I'll take out your fucking thorns.

1540
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,210
When I went to to drop
down to kill the deer,

1541
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,580
I sat down right in the cactus

1542
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,980
pat covered and

1543
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,540
you see your first year,

1544
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,460
you want to kill that thing so badly.

1545
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,091
I literally,

1546
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:41,960
I had a bucket in my crosshairs that
that third day when you got yours,

1547
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,943
I couldn't.

1548
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,600
I had talked about buck fever.

1549
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,660
The scope was bleeding.

1550
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,030
He jumping all over the place.

1551
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,540
I was like,

1552
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,373
this is my breathing.

1553
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:53,590
The first time I couldn't
get them into focus.

1554
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,880
The first time I went to shoot it because
in my I was too close to the scope and

1555
00:41:57,881 --> 00:41:59,350
then I realized what I was doing wrong.

1556
00:41:59,351 --> 00:41:59,770
I was like,

1557
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,011
oh,

1558
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:00,970
what am I doing over there?

1559
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:02,240
Stupid like what?

1560
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,101
What am I doing?

1561
00:42:03,101 --> 00:42:04,090
Like I was panicking.

1562
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,280
I just got too close to
the scope and it was like,

1563
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,740
it's weird when you're looking
at something through a scope,

1564
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:09,880
it's very hard to describe,

1565
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:13,670
but it's like almost like you're,

1566
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,020
you're,

1567
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,610
you see like black,

1568
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,910
like half moons over everything.

1569
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,150
Like you can't like close
in on the actual image,

1570
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,800
the outside of his all black.

1571
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,130
Did you keep your eye from a scope and
you stay and you start to be good at

1572
00:42:27,131 --> 00:42:27,341
that.

1573
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:30,550
When you and I backed
up just a hair and boom,

1574
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:31,331
it was in perfect,

1575
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:31,961
clear focus.

1576
00:42:31,961 --> 00:42:32,290
I was like,

1577
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:32,711
oh,

1578
00:42:32,711 --> 00:42:33,281
that's it.

1579
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:36,430
I was too close and then the
fucker went behind a cliff.

1580
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,623
The deer

1581
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,410
by the way,

1582
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:39,610
hunting deer hunting.

1583
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:42,540
Mule deer in a place where
they know they're being
hunted a lot like hunting and

1584
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,374
Mirage.

1585
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,760
They'll just show up and
then they just disappeared.

1586
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:46,061
And you're like,

1587
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:48,340
but how did it didn't
go into the mountain?

1588
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,090
Where is it?

1589
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:49,241
Well,

1590
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:49,900
they're so.

1591
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,310
They're so well camouflaged.

1592
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,680
They look exactly like the mountainside.

1593
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,070
Yeah.

1594
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,490
You don't see them until you see like
a little white tuft where their assets.

1595
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:57,751
Yeah,

1596
00:42:57,751 --> 00:42:59,550
I'm fine chasing for all morning.

1597
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,540
I finally,

1598
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,860
I got him on a stretcher,

1599
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:02,694
got him and I'm like,

1600
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,110
now we're this ridiculous.

1601
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:05,220
There's no way they
could have disappeared.

1602
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,450
Then I see ducks and I'm like,

1603
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:06,781
what are those?

1604
00:43:06,781 --> 00:43:07,770
Ducks have huge ears.

1605
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,790
Oh,

1606
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,770
those fuckers are
swimming across the river.

1607
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,040
I spent all morning chasing you assholes
and now you're across the river and I

1608
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,000
got no shot and uh,

1609
00:43:15,001 --> 00:43:15,270
yeah,

1610
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:16,590
I didn't even know they can swim.

1611
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,550
I didn't either.

1612
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,383
They swabbed,

1613
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,500
literally like swimming,

1614
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:19,741
like,

1615
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:20,270
you know,

1616
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,720
like covering serious ground.

1617
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:23,540
Where we went was so strange.

1618
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,220
It was such a bizarre,

1619
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,240
bizarre place.

1620
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,020
Cold,

1621
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,860
cold as fuck.

1622
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:28,723
And it was,

1623
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:33,170
it was just so unlike anything that you
never ever do in your normal life is a

1624
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:34,190
comedian in la.

1625
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,483
It's so true.

1626
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,920
We didn't have cell phones,

1627
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,290
we didn't have text messages.

1628
00:43:38,291 --> 00:43:40,640
I haven't done that in a long time man.

1629
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,740
And the crazy thing was.

1630
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,321
Oh we will.

1631
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:45,710
We'll talk about how
you have energy all day.

1632
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,410
Like even though you're
not eating the best food.

1633
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,580
I mean we had good food.

1634
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,660
We had to like camp food,

1635
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,730
like apples and we had like beef jerky
and we had freeze dried meals that we

1636
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:56,690
would have for dinner and
protein bars and stuff like that.

1637
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:57,860
It wasn't like we were malnourished.

1638
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,160
No,

1639
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,010
but we were talking about how
you get there and it's so quiet.

1640
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,330
You don't have access to your cell phone,

1641
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,180
no Internet,

1642
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:03,921
no nothing,

1643
00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:04,754
and I think,

1644
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,260
I think you're not spending
any time taking in stimulus.

1645
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:11,750
You just take your spending time
listening to your own breathing,

1646
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,050
you know,

1647
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,620
and responding and connecting with people.

1648
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,790
And somehow I had such clarity of
focus and energy on that whole time.

1649
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,170
It,

1650
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,030
it will.

1651
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,950
I definitely don't
think we're designed to,

1652
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,410
to live the way we live.

1653
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,041
You know,

1654
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:29,700
we're trying to adapt and I think future
generations will probably have some

1655
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:32,310
physical capabilities that we don't have.

1656
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,001
You know,

1657
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:38,001
because one thing about autism is that
fact that we are now you had these hyper

1658
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,090
hyper like autistic people who are
high functioning that can take in a

1659
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:43,050
tremendous amount of stimulus,

1660
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,690
see a room and count like you know,

1661
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,770
everything in it that fast on one of this,

1662
00:44:47,771 --> 00:44:50,340
this guy won and requests
was saying on Ted Dot Com.

1663
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:53,550
He's a venture capitalist
scientist and he said,

1664
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,810
you know,

1665
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,370
it may be that our brains,

1666
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,180
because we're exposed in such a short
period of time to 500 times a stimulus

1667
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:04,890
that are we see more in one day than our
ancestors saw on a you in a lifetime as

1668
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:06,330
far as just the amount of stimulus,

1669
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,560
the amount of sounds,

1670
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,270
the thoughts that are crammed into our
brains just through visual stimuli and

1671
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:15,660
auditory stimuli said
our brand is very well,

1672
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,720
may already be evolving to match and
coordinate with this ever changing

1673
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,580
exponentially growing environment.

1674
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,791
Well,

1675
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:25,020
that's what I'm wondering about.

1676
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:26,910
Like with Wifi Signal,

1677
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,490
cellular signals and all the different.

1678
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,580
There's like I don't understand signals,

1679
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,031
you know,

1680
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,770
I kind of know that they're there.

1681
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:36,090
I know that there's radio.

1682
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:37,350
I know that just television.

1683
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,900
I know that there's stuff that's
being sent out in somewhere.

1684
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:40,860
Someone's receiving it,

1685
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,600
but I don't understand it.

1686
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,630
And so I don't understand like
what is it doing to biology.

1687
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:48,210
They know that it's
having an effect on bees,

1688
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:49,650
especially cell phone signals.

1689
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,630
They think that it might be like a steady,

1690
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:54,420
like jackhammer sort of
thing that's affecting bees,

1691
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,950
like just an interference,

1692
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,360
like all member aliens is air,

1693
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,240
so it's,

1694
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,670
it's,

1695
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,030
that's what the Wifi signal.

1696
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,410
We talked about it yesterday.

1697
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:08,470
I honestly think all this stuff is edging
toward becoming one with the machines

1698
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,540
for real and then
ultimately to that effect,

1699
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,790
creating this sort of
universal connectedness.

1700
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,130
I wonder if it's biological for very long.

1701
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,300
I wonder if we're ever going to evolve.

1702
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:19,260
Wait,

1703
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,420
some ability to tune into these,

1704
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,360
these signals without adding
something to the body Audi

1705
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:25,830
without adding like a chip.

1706
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,840
Like how fucked would
it be if the healing.

1707
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:31,200
We are going to have chips way
before that question arises.

1708
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,910
I think things are moving so quickly.

1709
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:33,710
We have synthetic,

1710
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,543
uh,

1711
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,670
we're working on synthetic,

1712
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,953
biological,

1713
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,540
synthetically biological computer chips,

1714
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,373
faces.

1715
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,340
We're going to have like a google face.

1716
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:45,480
You're going to get a new face.

1717
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:46,681
I bet.

1718
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,540
I bet you could probably do that some day.

1719
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:49,880
Well,

1720
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,120
that's what Ray Kurzweil says.

1721
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,043
Yeah.

1722
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,890
I mean we're,

1723
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,520
we're going to be,

1724
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,810
we're going to mesh with machines.

1725
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:59,580
Why in the world if you had an eye that
could see a mile away and in the dark,

1726
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,730
why wouldn't you get an an artificial lie?

1727
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:03,953
Why wouldn't you?

1728
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:06,870
That's exactly what I'm old school.

1729
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,950
I don't need my leg.

1730
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,500
I'm going to sit here on my
porch until everything stops.

1731
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:15,510
Yeah.

1732
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:16,140
Why would you?

1733
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,891
But maybe you know,

1734
00:47:16,891 --> 00:47:18,150
maybe the next life is better.

1735
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,820
Maybe the better.

1736
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,050
I don't even know if there is.

1737
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:26,490
Maybe the afterlife is the notion that
you live on is a computer as a computer

1738
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:27,324
program.

1739
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:28,561
I mean,

1740
00:47:28,561 --> 00:47:28,930
right.

1741
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,201
That's.

1742
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:29,411
Look,

1743
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:29,840
it's not opposite.

1744
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,120
Look,

1745
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:30,953
if I can download,

1746
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,140
I can download your brain.

1747
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,610
Everything that goes onto your brain.

1748
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,260
I can download all the content.

1749
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,380
Right?

1750
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:36,630
Which,

1751
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,280
which computer science you're
talking about a matter of when?

1752
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:41,620
Not if like numb my brain.

1753
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:42,740
Like maybe you're not here,

1754
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,830
you're a brand new car.

1755
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,330
He's a huge mainframe.

1756
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,240
Too much going,

1757
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,660
but then I take that brand
and I put everything,

1758
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:52,240
all your memories and everything
to think about into a computer.

1759
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,550
I can put it into a robot maybe.

1760
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:55,380
Well,

1761
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,400
what does that say about your mortality?

1762
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,440
Well,

1763
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:58,810
no,

1764
00:47:58,810 --> 00:47:59,600
I don't know the answer.

1765
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,690
It's we only accepted if it's,

1766
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:02,860
if it's legit,

1767
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,180
if it's natural,

1768
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,250
that's when we accept
things when they're natural,

1769
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,593
you know,

1770
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,370
if you hate it.

1771
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:09,940
We,

1772
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,391
we've been,

1773
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:10,931
for example,

1774
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,130
genetically modifying

1775
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,550
crops like corn and things that you
would never recognize what corn was 200,

1776
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:19,390
300 years ago.

1777
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,530
It's a different,

1778
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:20,990
you know,

1779
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,191
it's,

1780
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:21,570
it's,

1781
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,870
it's everything you eat,

1782
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:27,550
everything including the animals you
eat has been genetically fucked with to

1783
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:31,930
become more productive in their
output and isn't ultimately.

1784
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,730
I mean we're calling it natural.

1785
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:37,270
What's natural and not natural but isn't
everything that human beings do natural

1786
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,590
because we're part of nature.

1787
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,160
Absolutely.

1788
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,380
Just as natural as the
process of making honey.

1789
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,610
But the other question,

1790
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,200
the other issue is that yes,

1791
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,700
the idea of the very idea of natural
and biology is going to change when we

1792
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:49,750
realize that this,

1793
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:53,320
this human being that I'm looking
at is a machine like anything else.

1794
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:53,891
In fact,

1795
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:58,210
a rather rudimentary machine maybe 300
years from now or 200 years from now or

1796
00:48:58,211 --> 00:48:59,044
50 years from now.

1797
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,050
It may very well be that we,

1798
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,330
once we figured out exactly
how the machine works with
the genome and all these

1799
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:05,530
other ideas,

1800
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:09,640
well I guess I could make now
even a more complex machine,

1801
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,260
so in the end of the day,

1802
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:16,480
if that machine is just as biological
but more complex than this rusty old

1803
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,970
machine that breaks down
after 90 years or whatever.

1804
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,050
Well,

1805
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:20,650
I don't know.

1806
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:22,330
I don't know what biology means anymore.

1807
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:26,500
What happens to the bacteria that exists
in the biological organism because

1808
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:27,334
that's like our,

1809
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,120
our tenants.

1810
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,241
Well,

1811
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:28,661
first of all,

1812
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:30,580
we're already well,

1813
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,930
but already what we're doing,

1814
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,520
what science is doing is trying
to learn how to harvest and,

1815
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,110
and,

1816
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:35,620
uh,

1817
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,620
the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria
and manage the body like an ecosystem,

1818
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,380
a mini ecosystem and science.

1819
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,880
More and more scientists are,

1820
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,580
are talking that the microbes
that make up our body are,

1821
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,410
are,

1822
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:54,700
are exactly why we are the way we are.

1823
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,320
They control everything from the,

1824
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:01,720
the natural moisture in our skin
to the way we smell to personality.

1825
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:02,551
Let's say the,

1826
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:02,950
yeah,

1827
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:04,840
it might have an effect on intelligence.

1828
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:06,730
Autism may be connected,

1829
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,500
certain types of autism spectrum
disorders might be connected to having an

1830
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:14,260
imbalanced flora.

1831
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:14,900
It's.

1832
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,970
It's fascinating,

1833
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:16,271
man.

1834
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:18,760
It's the human body's a host for life.

1835
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,840
There's billions and billions of
organisms living inside your body.

1836
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,703
That's right.

1837
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:23,981
Yeah.

1838
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:24,191
It's,

1839
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:24,520
it's,

1840
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,370
it's hard for us to really imagine
that we're not an individual.

1841
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:28,600
You know?

1842
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,350
It's hard for us to imagine
that we're a walking ecosystem.

1843
00:50:31,351 --> 00:50:31,500
Yeah.

1844
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,420
That's also the idea that,

1845
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:33,690
you know,

1846
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,400
it's maybe hard to imagine that we are,

1847
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,920
we are being nudged in
a certain direction.

1848
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,900
It's not this not chaos.

1849
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:40,170
There's,

1850
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:44,160
there's a direction we're being moved
in and its complexity always from,

1851
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,540
from the beginning of humans.

1852
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,420
True to the moment they figured
out how to roll things on logs.

1853
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,200
They have made it more and
more and more and more complex.

1854
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:52,830
Yeah.

1855
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:57,330
That's just what the only thing that's
not as complex as our stone work know,

1856
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,000
like ancient Egyptian stonework.

1857
00:50:59,070 --> 00:50:59,881
We had a guy in yesterday,

1858
00:50:59,881 --> 00:51:00,740
Philip Copans,

1859
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:01,260
who's this,

1860
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,140
wrote this great book
on lost civilization,

1861
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:04,800
enigma.

1862
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:05,361
It's all on,

1863
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:05,650
you know,

1864
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,810
like the ancient constructions of the
past and that's the only thing like today

1865
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:10,800
that we still go,

1866
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,390
God damn,

1867
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:15,870
these motherfuckers had some crazy
technology and some crazy insight that the

1868
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:16,704
Egyptians,

1869
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,700
the Egyptians,

1870
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:18,360
I mean even the,

1871
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,650
the Romans and a lot of other people
who have made some incredible pieces of

1872
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:23,484
architecture.

1873
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,500
It doesn't mean we couldn't do it today.

1874
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:25,920
Well,

1875
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,850
we are doing it today,

1876
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:27,684
but I think on a,

1877
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:30,150
on a subatomic level or a national level,

1878
00:51:30,151 --> 00:51:30,361
right?

1879
00:51:30,361 --> 00:51:30,571
Oh,

1880
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:30,930
sure,

1881
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:31,410
sure.

1882
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:31,710
Now,

1883
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:35,670
now most of the innovation is going
toward creating robotics and tissue

1884
00:51:35,671 --> 00:51:36,331
regeneration.

1885
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:37,440
Growing new limbs,

1886
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:40,200
we were talking about it that
we think that change that light.

1887
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:41,034
Hold on the idea.

1888
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:41,923
Change a light.

1889
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,233
What's in your eyes?

1890
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,393
This thing back here.

1891
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,790
Are Your eyes sensitive?

1892
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:47,624
My friend

1893
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,440
that they did call you.

1894
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:51,383
I,

1895
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,280
you know what a game I,

1896
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:55,671
his folks.

1897
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:58,160
So it's when you're in the
canoe and you're rowing,

1898
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,560
you look up in the hills
and if you see the aim,

1899
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:00,841
you're,

1900
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:01,591
you got the game.

1901
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:02,390
I,

1902
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:03,270
we saw a lot of,

1903
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:03,771
they called him.

1904
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:08,400
He came by the cashmere killer because
I was wearing three layers of cashmere

1905
00:52:08,401 --> 00:52:11,190
hunting deer and freezing
my fucking tail off.

1906
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,100
Still Fun.

1907
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:13,560
It was really fun.

1908
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,770
I'm so glad you went with me,

1909
00:52:14,771 --> 00:52:15,000
man.

1910
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,780
It would have made it.

1911
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,980
It made it a hundred times better.

1912
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,211
We did.

1913
00:52:17,211 --> 00:52:18,240
Was laugh the whole time.

1914
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:19,390
It was just great time.

1915
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,601
There was a time,

1916
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:23,940
I mean it's such a disrespectful moment
because we're actually butchering the

1917
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:24,750
deer,

1918
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,580
but as we were butchering this deer,

1919
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,680
we're cutting into sections and
I don't know what possessed him,

1920
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:35,760
but he got it to this thing of
jerking off into the ravine.

1921
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,950
My character was the ravine cut,

1922
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,060
so he starts doing this character where
he's angry about stuff with its tongue

1923
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:45,360
sticking out side of his mouth that he's
just jerked off into the ravine and it

1924
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,420
was so preposterous for
what was happening mean.

1925
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,440
Here we are like skinning this animal
and hocking chopping it couldn't take the

1926
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:53,970
sections off of him.

1927
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,710
It was really weird skinning an
animal and gutting it and skinning it,

1928
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:01,140
and so I know the problem is if
you put me in a sacred place,

1929
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,120
I start to freak out and do something,

1930
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,200
but you should've seen me at church.

1931
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:05,610
I went to church like
four times in my life.

1932
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:06,511
I couldn't do it.

1933
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:06,661
Dude,

1934
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:08,030
I'd start doing crazy shit.

1935
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:08,670
Well,

1936
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,481
that's what I told him.

1937
00:53:09,481 --> 00:53:11,250
I was like listening to
having this guy with this.

1938
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:13,410
It's gonna make the whole
thing 100 times funnier.

1939
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:13,891
Trust me.

1940
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:14,880
We're going to have a great time.

1941
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:16,410
Especially you and I together.

1942
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:17,380
You and I had together have a.

1943
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:17,840
We have,

1944
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,230
uh,

1945
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,670
you're one of my longest running
friends in La and we have a.

1946
00:53:21,671 --> 00:53:22,050
yeah,

1947
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:23,370
we know each other so well.

1948
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:24,420
We've been through so much shit.

1949
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,040
Brian,

1950
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,250
I,

1951
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,320
I sent my,

1952
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,760
uh,

1953
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,660
I've sent Brian to fuck my ex girlfriend
was because I had a girlfriend at the

1954
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:31,980
time and I didn't want to cheat.

1955
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:32,311
She's like,

1956
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:32,460
God,

1957
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,071
I'm so horny.

1958
00:53:33,071 --> 00:53:33,250
And like,

1959
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,083
like I'll hook you up.

1960
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:34,740
I'll go,

1961
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:34,861
hey,

1962
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:35,870
go even looks like me.

1963
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,890
Played my brother on news radio.

1964
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:38,724
Remember that?

1965
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,260
That was great.

1966
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:43,320
She was fantastic when
I was at fucking dirty,

1967
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,154
dirty girls

1968
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,310
dated this girl

1969
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:49,550
for a while.

1970
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:50,610
I think like,

1971
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:51,180
Hey,

1972
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,080
I want my friend to fuck my head.

1973
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,870
Shit.

1974
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:55,270
Let's.

1975
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:58,140
First of all I knew me and that girl
will never get them back together again.

1976
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,150
No disrespect to her nice personnel.

1977
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:00,451
That kid,

1978
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:02,820
but I knew it was never
happened again and he's my boy.

1979
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:03,723
He doesn't care.

1980
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,800
Give a fuck.

1981
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,740
She needed some Dick to Brian,

1982
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,430
give you a hunting trip.

1983
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,571
She's my friend.

1984
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:10,590
She needed some Dick.

1985
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,400
You know,

1986
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,300
what am I supposed to do?

1987
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,070
Say you know,

1988
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,381
you're,

1989
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:14,940
you know I can't help you.

1990
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,720
I can help her.

1991
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,990
I had the fucking solution called me up.

1992
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,161
I'm setting.

1993
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:19,300
Yeah.

1994
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,133
What are you doing tomorrow?

1995
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,340
I don't know that I said
you're going to go fuck my ex.

1996
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,993
I think

1997
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:32,550
he fucked her behind a car and shot a
load into her and she calls me the next

1998
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,551
day.

1999
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:34,320
Your fucking friend came inside me.

2000
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,043
I was,

2001
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:37,903
what am I supposed to do?

2002
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,620
Laughing so hard.

2003
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:42,540
I was crying.

2004
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:44,200
I was holding back because
I know you so well.

2005
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:47,520
You're so fucking crazy and that could
believe that we did it in the first

2006
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:47,881
place.

2007
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:48,241
I said,

2008
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:48,631
you have to go.

2009
00:54:48,631 --> 00:54:49,260
Fuck her.

2010
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,320
I'm not even just laughing while you.

2011
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,290
She's telling me fucking friend Kate with.

2012
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,750
I get very few ex-girlfriends,

2013
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,140
whoever called me up complaining

2014
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:01,850
not to.

2015
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:03,630
I was younger having sex.

2016
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:04,441
Aren't I supposed to do that?

2017
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:05,110
I don't know.

2018
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,130
That's funny thing.

2019
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:07,740
I.

2020
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:07,931
Yeah.

2021
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:10,620
You think about how fucking what a
numbskull I was when I was younger,

2022
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,780
just I didn't understand
girls were different.

2023
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:13,830
I didn't really understand

2024
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:19,320
why they were just like me and then I
dated a girl who'd be like looking back on

2025
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:19,381
it.

2026
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:21,000
They were all great and I'd be like,

2027
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:21,480
why am I.

2028
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:21,681
Why?

2029
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:22,170
Why?

2030
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,000
Why is she not behaving like my friends?

2031
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,080
She's a fucking girl.

2032
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:25,914
You idiot.

2033
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:29,190
It takes a while to understand
that I was just a fucking idiot.

2034
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:30,600
Were those poor girls were like,

2035
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:31,643
what is with this,

2036
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:31,921
this,

2037
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:32,900
this caveman?

2038
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:33,690
You know,

2039
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:36,030
I'm not gonna fuck you in the elevator.

2040
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:37,480
This is whenever it was.

2041
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,813
I bought.

2042
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,200
Well you should be more into.

2043
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,960
I broke up with a girl because she
fell asleep during raging bull.

2044
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,720
That's not fair to a girl.

2045
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,690
It's a great movie,

2046
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:47,490
but it's a fucking movie about a boxer.

2047
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:49,050
The guys like girls aren't supposed to.

2048
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:49,610
You know.

2049
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,240
It's not fair for me to be mad.

2050
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:51,691
I was like,

2051
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:52,351
this is one of the great.

2052
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:54,750
This is my favorite movie of all
time and you fell asleep in it.

2053
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,490
I'm afraid I have nothing
in common with you.

2054
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,361
I didn't say that,

2055
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:58,590
but I made that choice in my head.

2056
00:55:58,591 --> 00:55:58,980
I was like,

2057
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,111
well,

2058
00:55:59,111 --> 00:55:59,910
she hot.

2059
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:00,421
Yes,

2060
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:01,020
but I was like,

2061
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,853
I don't know

2062
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,113
what is.

2063
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,280
One of the things that I pride myself
in is I've never tried to make someone

2064
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:15,950
that I've dated any
different than who they are.

2065
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,240
You are always good to learn.

2066
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,530
I was a fucking idiot.

2067
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:19,981
Well,

2068
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:20,440
I just know.

2069
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,151
Is it more for me,

2070
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:21,540
it was just like,

2071
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,020
how can we bring someone,

2072
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,130
tell them they have

2073
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:24,963
to read it.

2074
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:25,631
I was like,

2075
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:26,640
how can you not be interested in this?

2076
00:56:26,641 --> 00:56:27,371
This is amazing.

2077
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:27,501
Well,

2078
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:28,910
they were fucking thing.

2079
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:29,813
They got their own thing.

2080
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,100
They were smarter than I was.

2081
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:31,901
I looked back on it,

2082
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,790
they knew if I had listened
to them I would have,

2083
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:35,260
I would've been better off.

2084
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:40,480
There's a lot of things that people I
like really love and I could not care less

2085
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,350
if it existed,

2086
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:45,460
whether it's sports or certain types
of music and I could love these person,

2087
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,820
these people to death and
whatever their opinion is.

2088
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,210
I just like Eddie Bravo was always trying
to turn me onto some new electronic

2089
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:55,690
band and like four out of five
of them are pretty decent,

2090
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,980
but every now and then there's,

2091
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:57,390
you know,

2092
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:57,670
he's,

2093
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:01,160
he's into some shit that
I'm not into a fiery series.

2094
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,130
Those are pretty high odds.

2095
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,330
I bet it's less than that.

2096
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:04,591
Yeah,

2097
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:05,121
you're probably right.

2098
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:05,954
It's about three,

2099
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:06,970
three out of five.

2100
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,310
So nice being nice because I love Eddie.

2101
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,000
Three of it,

2102
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,840
but it's not luck.

2103
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,010
It's just taste in music.

2104
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,900
Like he really loves smashing pumpkins.

2105
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,480
He really loves Leonard Skinner Guy.

2106
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:17,620
I'm a led Zeppelin guy.

2107
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,230
I love like hearing the fucking
guitar scratching on the pit.

2108
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:22,241
You know what I mean?

2109
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:22,601
I want,

2110
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:24,340
I want to hear like the black keys,

2111
00:57:24,341 --> 00:57:25,240
like that's my cousin.

2112
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,320
Also musicians,

2113
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,680
a lot of times we're listening
to something different
than we are here more than

2114
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:34,360
we do or they're just more in tune with
something innovative or Eddie has a very

2115
00:57:34,361 --> 00:57:37,260
specific style that he
fucking loves and you know,

2116
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,990
and he's very creative man.

2117
00:57:38,991 --> 00:57:40,000
I mean his own music.

2118
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,631
He's like,

2119
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:40,991
if you're,

2120
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:42,700
if you're into that style of music,

2121
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,150
like Eddie does some really topnotch
shit and now he does it with this dude

2122
00:57:46,151 --> 00:57:46,730
compel a.

2123
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,050
They have this band called smoke serpent
and like compel who's a really good

2124
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,540
rapper like wraps over
it and it plays like,

2125
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:53,010
you know,

2126
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:56,150
Eddie puts his music on the background
and his thing has always been that like

2127
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,620
he always loved hip hop but he didn't
like the kind of music that was in the

2128
00:57:59,621 --> 00:58:00,580
background of hip hop.

2129
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:03,460
He didn't like that whole sampling
fan and thought it would be,

2130
00:58:03,461 --> 00:58:04,090
you know,

2131
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:04,810
he liked,

2132
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,090
he's got like that sort of electronic,

2133
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:08,440
a smashing Pumpkin,

2134
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:09,820
sort of a vibe of music.

2135
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:10,654
He's really into that.

2136
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:11,831
Everybody's different.

2137
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:14,020
Why that is everybody's fucking different.

2138
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:14,621
Wiring right,

2139
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:14,950
yeah,

2140
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:15,521
for sure.

2141
00:58:15,521 --> 00:58:15,821
I mean,

2142
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:16,121
look,

2143
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:19,090
there's some people who hate
violence and hate violence sports.

2144
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:19,451
They don't.

2145
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:20,680
I mean they just don't like it,

2146
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:23,530
but I can have great conversations
with them about other stuff.

2147
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:24,221
You know,

2148
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:24,490
there's.

2149
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:25,240
Listen man,

2150
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,110
I just thought it was so funny the minute
I saw that dear and I had one shot to

2151
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:29,801
get this to you because you,

2152
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:33,340
you go all day looking for deer and
you don't see what it was so cold.

2153
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:33,730
I,

2154
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,930
the minute I saw that book,

2155
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,820
My hat came off everything.

2156
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,020
I didn't feel anything.

2157
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:39,070
I was just literally like,

2158
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,810
I'm going to kill that fucking book.

2159
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,760
I,

2160
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,020
I'm not a hunter and I don't
really necessarily want to kill.

2161
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,280
So we were on a mission.

2162
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:45,910
You know what?

2163
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:49,390
We were doing something that was very
unusual for two guys that are in their

2164
00:58:49,391 --> 00:58:51,790
forties with kids living in La,

2165
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,530
in the entertainment business,

2166
00:58:53,531 --> 00:58:55,640
sort of sort of still in
entertainment business.

2167
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,370
I do comedy shows,

2168
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,170
I guess the there on my own,

2169
00:58:59,171 --> 00:58:59,590
but I mean,

2170
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,350
I guess,

2171
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:00,910
but you know,

2172
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,050
those guys were a great audience,

2173
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:02,884
weren't they?

2174
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,943
Are Guides.

2175
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:04,720
Stanford,

2176
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,553
Ella and Ryan,

2177
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,701
what's his last name?

2178
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:06,970
Ryan.

2179
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:07,840
Ryan Callahan,

2180
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,280
who's a great guy.

2181
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,611
Was My,

2182
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:09,870
uh,

2183
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:10,080
my,

2184
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:10,930
my guide ride,

2185
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:12,400
mow the director.

2186
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:15,180
God I can't wait to do.

2187
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:17,860
They were all great guys and
these guys are solid as fuck man.

2188
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:18,940
They were a great audience.

2189
00:59:18,941 --> 00:59:19,361
Loved that.

2190
00:59:19,361 --> 00:59:21,710
He just laughed at us
fucking around all the time.

2191
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:22,603
Well,

2192
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,770
I don't think they'd probably
ever done a show like that.

2193
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,633
You know,

2194
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,490
Brian went like,

2195
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,610
from the moment we got there where I was
full tilt from the moment we got there,

2196
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:32,180
he was,

2197
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,260
this is all mining.

2198
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,981
See this,

2199
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:36,140
this is a longterm strip mining.

2200
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:36,621
And I go,

2201
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:36,921
no,

2202
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:37,131
I go,

2203
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:38,210
this is the Missouri River.

2204
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:39,410
You fucked this cut through this.

2205
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:42,040
It used to be the great
western indigency no,

2206
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,111
no,

2207
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:42,231
no.

2208
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:42,900
This is mine.

2209
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,790
I was talking to Steve Right now.

2210
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,040
It's been there and I grew up there like,

2211
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:47,541
yeah,

2212
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:48,160
this is my,

2213
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,620
this is not.

2214
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,251
This is all natural.

2215
00:59:49,251 --> 00:59:49,910
I go,

2216
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:50,743
you're wrong about that.

2217
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,793
But anyway,

2218
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,980
right away he gets into his ridiculous
character and then it gets gay or queer

2219
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,283
cracking.

2220
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,330
I'm cracking jokes.

2221
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:00,320
So as long as cracking job,

2222
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,640
that's all I'm living for at that point.

2223
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:02,271
So I'm like,

2224
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:04,130
if I got an audience I
can just see Joe's eyes.

2225
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:05,030
They're slits and he's like,

2226
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,790
oh my God,

2227
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,630
that's fucking it.

2228
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:08,463
It was like,

2229
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,040
it was seriously no bullshit.

2230
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:14,390
Like going on a five day comedy show
where inbetween you took breaks to go.

2231
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,640
We have a lot on camera.

2232
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:16,940
We got it.

2233
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,620
We got to steal it and
put it on the fucking.

2234
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,580
Well there's certain things like they
said that they were going to give it to us

2235
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,230
because they could never
put it on their show,

2236
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:25,560
but he a

2237
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,360
lot of control on this show.

2238
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,970
I think it's on the sportsmans channel,

2239
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,950
one of those channels
towards hunting shows,

2240
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:32,701
which by the way,

2241
01:00:32,701 --> 01:00:34,560
I watch now and watch
all these hunting shows.

2242
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:37,410
Now I'm fucking recording them and
watching hunting channels that you do it.

2243
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:38,680
It's so fast and you know what it's like,

2244
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,900
I didn't get it.

2245
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,130
You're in the middle of nowhere.

2246
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,890
You never going to see this
topography and then you see a deer,

2247
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,810
you see like something that
you could actually get.

2248
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:46,610
And I,

2249
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,850
I love deer meat by the way,

2250
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,000
but,

2251
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,320
but you know,

2252
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,070
you see it and you're like everything.

2253
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:51,120
It's like winning the lottery.

2254
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,230
It's like almost sudden you're like,

2255
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,100
Whoa,

2256
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,150
this whole rush,

2257
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,540
you know,

2258
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,980
of discovering something new.

2259
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:56,700
Well,

2260
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,050
you're in their world.

2261
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,390
That's the weirdest
thing about what it is,

2262
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:03,810
is when you do this sort of what
they call immersion hunting.

2263
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:04,590
We,

2264
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,140
we basically went into the wild,

2265
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,300
like the real legitimate wild.

2266
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,640
It's not a road that's untraveled.

2267
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:12,930
People travel it every year,

2268
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:14,340
but it's not that many.

2269
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,740
And the people that are traveling
are all doing what you're doing.

2270
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:18,900
They're all sneaking up on
deers and shooting them.

2271
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:20,640
And while we were there,

2272
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:21,870
we were there for five days.

2273
01:01:21,871 --> 01:01:23,760
We saw three other canoes.

2274
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,120
So that was it to two other campsites.

2275
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,190
So what it is,

2276
01:01:29,191 --> 01:01:33,990
is this really inhospitable
terrain that occasionally,

2277
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:34,231
you know,

2278
01:01:34,231 --> 01:01:36,810
every couple of days or so a
new person will venture into.

2279
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,790
And it's that crazy.

2280
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,500
It's another world.

2281
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,360
This world doesn't have
any cell phone signal.

2282
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,680
You don't see a building anywhere.

2283
01:01:43,681 --> 01:01:47,610
You get on top of the mountain
and you climb up for hours,

2284
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:52,620
you get to the top and you look out and
it's Kinda scary because you don't see

2285
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,500
shit for anywhere to the
left or to the right.

2286
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:57,660
It's more of these hills and valleys,

2287
01:01:57,661 --> 01:01:59,520
hills and valleys and no help.

2288
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,570
No stores,

2289
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,523
no nothing.

2290
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:05,340
So you got what you brought with you
and what you can kill here and cook.

2291
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:06,203
That's right.

2292
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:06,961
That's exactly right.

2293
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:11,850
And so when you creep up on a deer and
wind up shooting that deer and killing

2294
01:02:11,851 --> 01:02:11,971
it,

2295
01:02:11,971 --> 01:02:13,320
like you like entered into a,

2296
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:15,150
like a different reality,

2297
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,920
you like plugged into this
different reality of hunting also.

2298
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,220
Like I thought the most profound part
of it was butchering my own deer.

2299
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:23,401
Yeah.

2300
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:25,480
And I'll tell you why it was we,

2301
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,600
we have a real disconnect
to the food we'd right.

2302
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:32,010
So you go to Mcdonald's and you're
eating a steer that was maybe killed,

2303
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:32,970
I don't know how many months ago,

2304
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:33,320
you know,

2305
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:33,610
and,

2306
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:33,990
and,

2307
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:38,200
and then the skin by some stranger and
then quartered and put together and grind

2308
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:40,650
in process with other beef cows.

2309
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:41,610
And it's a mixture of shit,

2310
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:42,960
maybe some of the cows came from China,

2311
01:02:42,961 --> 01:02:45,360
so I'm guessing it's the same thing with
chicken and stuff and you see there's a

2312
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,500
real disconnect with the kind of the
animal protein that we don't know how it's

2313
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:49,861
lived.

2314
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:50,790
We don't know how it's suffered.

2315
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,630
We don't know anything about it.

2316
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,130
And that's always bothered me.

2317
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,190
And one of the things I thought was
there were two things I found profound

2318
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:56,640
about,

2319
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:59,820
about not only killing
a deer with that rifle,

2320
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:00,010
the,

2321
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:01,500
the force and the feeling of it,

2322
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,070
you know,

2323
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:02,850
but also,

2324
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,210
um,

2325
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,260
then butchering the meat,

2326
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,400
the,

2327
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:05,661
the,

2328
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,710
the intimate process of,

2329
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:12,830
of gutting a deer and harvesting
the liver and the heart.

2330
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,000
And then,

2331
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,720
and then cutting a skinning
it and cutting into that,

2332
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:18,270
that meat that you're going to eat,

2333
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:19,560
the heat,

2334
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:22,350
the heat from the inside of its body
because you got to get in there,

2335
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:22,881
you know.

2336
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:23,080
Um,

2337
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:23,730
I had blood,

2338
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:24,380
we both had blood.

2339
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,340
I had passed my wrists.

2340
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,610
And the intimate process of doing that,

2341
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:32,760
the smell and the feel
and the temperature,

2342
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:35,020
you really get a sense of the,

2343
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:40,040
the vast discrepancy between life and
death and our own biology and how fragile,

2344
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:40,890
you know,

2345
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:42,000
we are like,

2346
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:43,460
you see what a scalpel,

2347
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:47,370
what a small knife can do to
muscle and skin and sinew.

2348
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,720
It's frightening.

2349
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:51,420
It's frightening how
easy it is to gut a deer,

2350
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:53,100
which is much stronger animal than I am.

2351
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,850
You know,

2352
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,030
it's,

2353
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,590
it's just frightening to think about.

2354
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,370
So it creates in your,

2355
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:02,390
in your own sort of visceral sense of
true vulnerability and more importantly,

2356
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,310
our own biology and I,

2357
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,200
I then had a very strong understanding
that idea of how easy it was for hunter

2358
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:14,670
gatherer or even our very recent
ancestors to kill another human being.

2359
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:19,170
Because when you kill an animal and you
butcher it and you get that close to its

2360
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,710
body and its heart and its life
force and then you see it go away.

2361
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,450
Killing a human being would be exactly
the same thing and a lot of ways because

2362
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:28,710
it's just another animal.

2363
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:31,620
Now obviously we have different
motifs on what a human being is.

2364
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:33,000
They have a conscience
and all that and blah,

2365
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:33,151
blah,

2366
01:04:33,151 --> 01:04:33,330
blah,

2367
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:38,040
but I'm just saying that I can understand
how a hunter would make a very good

2368
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,290
and ready warrior.

2369
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:39,740
There's A.

2370
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:40,573
There's a very,

2371
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:45,650
very thin divide and most of us as men
in today's world don't ever experience

2372
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:47,364
either one.

2373
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,880
We don't have experienced
death that that intimately.

2374
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:54,210
We don't experience even
fighting that intimately.

2375
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,590
Everything has to be simulation.

2376
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:59,190
It has to be either a fucking
video game or a legitimate.

2377
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,820
Yeah,

2378
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,840
but not even that.

2379
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,390
You're saying a Jujitsu match.

2380
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,540
That's the rarest of the rare.

2381
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,250
Usually it's an argument in traffic.

2382
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:05,671
Oh,

2383
01:05:05,671 --> 01:05:05,870
I'm.

2384
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,750
That's virtually no testing yourself.

2385
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:09,603
Like right.

2386
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,850
No connection to life and death like that.

2387
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,390
Yeah,

2388
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,750
I mean that's one of the grateful.

2389
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:15,300
It made me warm,

2390
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,280
respectful of deer of the being

2391
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,470
up being with a hunter like Ryan or Steve.

2392
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:24,730
What you realize actually is at
hunters to be an effective hunter,

2393
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:27,160
the irony is you have to have a deep,

2394
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:28,030
deep respect,

2395
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:31,360
love and understanding of the animal.

2396
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:36,280
It's behavior and of the environment
in which you are now a guest in.

2397
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:36,431
No,

2398
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:36,731
listen,

2399
01:05:36,731 --> 01:05:37,564
it's not easy.

2400
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:38,471
It's not easy.

2401
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:38,680
I mean,

2402
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:41,500
people think you're just going out
there and shooting defenseless animals.

2403
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:41,790
No,

2404
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:42,100
you're.

2405
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,940
What you're doing is you're going out
and getting your own meat and it's a

2406
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,290
difficult fucking process.

2407
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,810
It's very difficult and you
guys were really good at it.

2408
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,270
Those guys love every aspect of it.

2409
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:53,620
The ryans and the Steve,

2410
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:55,030
Steve Rainelle and Ryan Callahan.

2411
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:56,140
Those guys that took us out there.

2412
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,050
They love every aspect of
their conservationists.

2413
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,053
Yeah,

2414
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:01,510
true conservationist.

2415
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:03,330
They follow the rules to a t.

2416
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:06,460
They know every rule for
every area of their hunting.

2417
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:07,930
The pay attention to all of it.

2418
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:09,030
Like where we were at,

2419
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,050
we couldn't use two way communication
so no one could say like,

2420
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:12,251
hey,

2421
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:12,971
we saw some deer,

2422
01:06:12,971 --> 01:06:13,201
this one,

2423
01:06:13,201 --> 01:06:14,890
and you can't say that over the radio.

2424
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:15,590
It's illegal.

2425
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:16,880
Do you know what happened
to me when I was hunting?

2426
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,490
It changed my political
point of view a little bit.

2427
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,120
Really?

2428
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,361
Yeah.

2429
01:06:19,361 --> 01:06:20,010
You know why?

2430
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:20,530
Why?

2431
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:20,950
Well,

2432
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,470
this is weird because I was talking
about being a libertarian and everything

2433
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:23,651
else,

2434
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:28,651
but then I realized the value and the
importance of having strong regulation and

2435
01:06:29,021 --> 01:06:33,040
rules for because if you talk to hunters
and people are really know without

2436
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,020
really strong anti poaching laws,

2437
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:35,650
for example,

2438
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:38,470
are really strong regulation
by the fish and game service,

2439
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:43,060
you would have everybody
that I've talked to a grace,

2440
01:06:43,061 --> 01:06:45,580
you'd have major abuses by assholes,

2441
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:50,410
just machine gunning the whole fucking
side of that Ridge when they saw rams and

2442
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:55,060
you'd have no game left and in fact
American history and history in the Middle

2443
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,893
East certainly that I know of,

2444
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,730
but bears that out,

2445
01:06:57,731 --> 01:06:58,211
that that,

2446
01:06:58,211 --> 01:07:00,220
that people always over hunted,

2447
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:03,430
they always overfished and
they continued to do that.

2448
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:05,590
People are concerned that they wouldn't.

2449
01:07:05,591 --> 01:07:05,840
When,

2450
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,070
when our ancestors figured out that you
could run woolly mammoths off a cliff,

2451
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,740
guess what?

2452
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:10,930
William man has disappeared.

2453
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,920
You know,

2454
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:12,491
and they start.

2455
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:12,980
I mean that.

2456
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,950
That's the,

2457
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:15,400
this is what happens.

2458
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:20,430
So human beings actually can be very
short sighted and can like kind of not do

2459
01:07:20,891 --> 01:07:21,850
what's in their best interest.

2460
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:22,720
Sometimes you need,

2461
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:23,081
you need,

2462
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:23,471
you need,

2463
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:24,430
you need some regulation.

2464
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:24,791
Well,

2465
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:25,330
you didn't.

2466
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,520
You didn't think that the fishing game,

2467
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:28,810
that was a good idea,

2468
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,710
but I didn't know.

2469
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,970
I didn't know about it.

2470
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:34,060
I just always have a visceral reaction
to any government organization and I go,

2471
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:34,360
well,

2472
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,470
are they making it worse or better?

2473
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:36,010
No,

2474
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,810
there are some very good and important.

2475
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:40,060
They're the probably
government regulation.

2476
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,710
It's all done by hunters.

2477
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:43,660
It's all done by people
who will hopefully.

2478
01:07:43,661 --> 01:07:46,570
I think there was some dispute about
who was going to be in charge of it.

2479
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:49,840
Now it's like people who are
more animal rights oriented.

2480
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:50,081
No,

2481
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:54,880
I don't trust her neighbor and Ela and
guys like Ryan have are huge believers in

2482
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:55,000
the.

2483
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,530
A huge lovers of animals.

2484
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:56,860
Yeah,

2485
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:57,611
and the other thing is,

2486
01:07:57,611 --> 01:07:58,444
man,

2487
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:02,980
the people can't deny that it needs to
be done because there's only two options.

2488
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:06,550
Either you hunt the animals
or you reintroduce predators,

2489
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,230
and when you reintroduce predators,

2490
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:09,700
you've got a whole new set of problems.

2491
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:10,241
First of all,

2492
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:12,550
you've cut down on some eat free meat.

2493
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,470
So unless you're saying that
people should stop eating meat.

2494
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,220
Totally.

2495
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:17,980
You've cut down on the
amount of meat you've,

2496
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:18,240
you've,

2497
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:23,080
you've cut down on the most humane
way of ever harvesting an animal,

2498
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:26,960
letting the animal live his entire life
wild and normal and undisturbed until

2499
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:27,794
you take it,

2500
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,310
so literally as a free animal and you
go and earn it and get that animal.

2501
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:34,880
It's an animal trapped in a pen that
you forced into a corralled area.

2502
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:36,350
Then it gets a piston through the brain.

2503
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:40,190
It's like it's the main plot,

2504
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,580
so I don't understand why you
would want people to stop doing it.

2505
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:48,980
Is it the idea that people are upset at
the idea of someone actually taking the

2506
01:08:49,221 --> 01:08:50,210
life themselves?

2507
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:50,451
I mean,

2508
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:51,350
that must be.

2509
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:53,330
That's the only argument I can see.

2510
01:08:53,331 --> 01:08:53,810
You know,

2511
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:54,481
maybe it's stayed.

2512
01:08:54,481 --> 01:08:58,100
They recognize that that connection
between taking that animal and you,

2513
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,400
that animals is very close to the
connection of taking a human life.

2514
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:03,110
My issue with hunting is like I would.

2515
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:06,230
I would not hunt a bear or a lion or
something that I'm not going to eat.

2516
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:07,161
I don't believe in that.

2517
01:09:07,161 --> 01:09:08,300
I don't like hunting.

2518
01:09:08,301 --> 01:09:09,530
Mountain lions stays good.

2519
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:12,380
Steven Ellis said that mountain
lion steak is delicious.

2520
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:12,531
Yeah,

2521
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:13,081
I read it.

2522
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:14,120
He talks about it in the book.

2523
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:15,820
He's got tasting notes on mountain lions.

2524
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,700
Pretty funny on the media,

2525
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:17,631
but I,

2526
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:18,110
I,

2527
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,500
um,

2528
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:19,071
it's actually,

2529
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:19,291
it's,

2530
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:22,490
it's hit or miss with mountain lions
sometimes it's so string you can't even

2531
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,080
literally can't even chew into it.

2532
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:28,550
Then other times you gotta if you
roast it for a long time in a stew,

2533
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,410
like a slow cooker,

2534
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,860
it's kind of a pale meat in it.

2535
01:09:30,861 --> 01:09:31,450
It's got,

2536
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:32,360
it's got an okay taste.

2537
01:09:32,361 --> 01:09:33,410
But in fact,

2538
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:33,870
in fact,

2539
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:37,270
eating predators that eat that
live on animal protein is,

2540
01:09:37,271 --> 01:09:40,060
is not such a good idea
except fish except for fish.

2541
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:41,210
Fish are all delicious.

2542
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:42,044
Lead fish.

2543
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:42,351
Yeah,

2544
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:42,980
that's a good point.

2545
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,330
That's why you catch them with lures.

2546
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:44,870
But um,

2547
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:46,920
but fucks with a,

2548
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,350
it's like throwing a robot in front of
you that you think you could fuck it.

2549
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,580
Dive on an Prong,

2550
01:09:51,581 --> 01:09:54,050
sticking your ass hole and you get
dragged into another dimension.

2551
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,090
It's like so rude about what you say.

2552
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:58,970
It's like rude things to eat.

2553
01:09:58,971 --> 01:09:59,870
Things with their face.

2554
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,351
Yeah.

2555
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:01,640
You catch them by the face?

2556
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,540
Yeah.

2557
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:02,970
Well,

2558
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:03,910
the dive sites,

2559
01:10:03,911 --> 01:10:04,840
so afraid of the ocean.

2560
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:05,120
It's.

2561
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,350
It's shouldn't be.

2562
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,610
Have you seen the ocean at night?

2563
01:10:07,611 --> 01:10:08,480
Dark when it's dark.

2564
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:08,950
Pitch Five.

2565
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,040
I've been on it in a boat before.

2566
01:10:10,041 --> 01:10:10,761
It was terrifying.

2567
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:11,300
Me Too.

2568
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,940
My parents lived on a sailboat
for a couple of years.

2569
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:14,660
Oh my God.

2570
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:14,811
Yeah.

2571
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:19,000
My parents got a wild hair across the
ass and they decided to retire and kicked

2572
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:22,220
back for Awhile and my dad just
stopped working for a few years.

2573
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,110
He went back to work afterwards,

2574
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:27,700
but he stopped working for a few years
and just sailed around the world.

2575
01:10:27,740 --> 01:10:29,270
They lived in the Bahamas for awhile.

2576
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,950
They looking for and they
get stuck in a hurricane.

2577
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:31,661
Once you have it,

2578
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,350
then I always worry
about pirates and things.

2579
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,243
Yes,

2580
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:35,120
I need.

2581
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,190
I mean if I can have a
turret gun and if I can,

2582
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:42,170
50 caliber sniper rifle and a seal
team following me until we address the

2583
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,250
imbalance of the world.

2584
01:10:43,251 --> 01:10:45,320
Brian calendar is always
going to be pirates.

2585
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:46,830
It's,

2586
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,570
you know,

2587
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:48,210
we always,

2588
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:48,800
you know,

2589
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,140
we're always concerned with
fattening up our own pockets,

2590
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:53,930
but unless we feed those
poor people of Somalia,

2591
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:55,370
they're going to keep
doing what they want to do.

2592
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:56,780
I agree.

2593
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:57,950
How do you fix that?

2594
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,910
Like the Somalia thing,

2595
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:03,130
so it's literally an area
the size of Texas are known.

2596
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:04,011
The Western Europe.

2597
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:04,700
I mean that,

2598
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,060
that area that they talk
about is so vast and yes,

2599
01:11:08,061 --> 01:11:10,880
you're going to have very poor
people who come in and go,

2600
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:11,180
let's,

2601
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,180
let's hijack that very big
boat and take whatever.

2602
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,690
You don't even,

2603
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:14,940
you know,

2604
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:15,521
how it started.

2605
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,760
Do you know the Somalian thing started,

2606
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,450
they call themselves the
volunteer coastguard of
Somalia because what happened

2607
01:11:21,451 --> 01:11:26,451
was the Somalian people were essentially
fishermen and European started dumping

2608
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:28,860
toxic waste off their and fishing.

2609
01:11:28,861 --> 01:11:29,694
They're shorts,

2610
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,661
overfishing,

2611
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,100
their shores with nets and shit and using,

2612
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:34,540
uh,

2613
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,373
did you hear that?

2614
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,720
Or was it just made you hear that pop?

2615
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:42,230
I didn't hear you and polluting it with
all sorts of toxic waste and just fucked

2616
01:11:44,371 --> 01:11:45,310
up their whole ecosystem.

2617
01:11:45,311 --> 01:11:46,980
So all of a sudden these
people can't fish anymore.

2618
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,960
So they started holding
these people captive,

2619
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:52,350
they would catch one of these fishing
boat or when these boats dumping shit off

2620
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:52,771
their coast,

2621
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:55,500
they would kidnap them and they would
demand a ransom because you guys are

2622
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:56,430
fucked up our fishing,

2623
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,264
we want some money,

2624
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,111
and then they realize,

2625
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:58,411
you know what,

2626
01:11:58,411 --> 01:11:59,071
fuck fishing,

2627
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:00,010
let's just start jacking.

2628
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,320
Do It's all these people are in boats.

2629
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:02,060
They all want.

2630
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,120
Everybody's going to want them back.

2631
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,530
And so they just started
taking over boats.

2632
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,140
So it was total chaos.

2633
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:07,680
Yeah.

2634
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,980
I always think about that navy seal
guy that actually on a boat as it was

2635
01:12:10,981 --> 01:12:14,400
bobbing up and down shot
that dude with a headshot.

2636
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,030
It's incredible.

2637
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,620
It's his boat was bobbing up and down.

2638
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,660
What you call good marksmanship.

2639
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,490
If I used a mag 300,

2640
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,710
apparently the guy dropped
that deer with it was what?

2641
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:23,430
The seal team.

2642
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:24,930
Some of the seal teams and I produce.

2643
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:26,070
That was a sick gun.

2644
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:27,930
The gun was pretty awesome.

2645
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:29,010
It was really accurate.

2646
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:29,421
You,

2647
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:31,680
you shot really well till you
dropped your deer at what?

2648
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,630
Two hundred yards and then
they said it was a great shot.

2649
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,580
It was a,

2650
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:35,640
it's hard to stay calm,

2651
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,623
but like I said,

2652
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,510
I'm so used to doing
things when I'm nervous.

2653
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:42,810
I think it helped me to like knowing
how to stay calm once I went,

2654
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:47,040
once I remembered to just control my
breathing and just focus on my trigger

2655
01:12:47,041 --> 01:12:47,421
finger.

2656
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:48,254
It was everything stopped.

2657
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,800
It's so easy to say,

2658
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:51,360
but it's so hard to get a calm,

2659
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,790
relaxing because you're,

2660
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,170
you're also trying to calm yourself down
with a breath to begin with usually in

2661
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:00,480
seconds because it's fucking
thing is not going to stay still.

2662
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:04,530
It's not because things moving so as
it's trying to be on your belly and you

2663
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:06,330
know he had quills in your fucking leg.

2664
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:07,170
Steven Nyla blue,

2665
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:08,340
a little horn that like,

2666
01:13:08,341 --> 01:13:09,440
it sounds like a fun,

2667
01:13:09,441 --> 01:13:09,940
like,

2668
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,980
like a little thing and the deer
won't like this and then boom,

2669
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:15,360
he just shot him.

2670
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:15,960
Yeah,

2671
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:16,980
it's fucked up man.

2672
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,900
The whole process of it was fascinating.

2673
01:13:18,901 --> 01:13:20,040
Then eating it that night.

2674
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:20,880
Well,

2675
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,220
you had gotten a deer and I was so
worried I wasn't going to get a deer

2676
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:25,500
and then I was like,

2677
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,311
we're going for a buck,

2678
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:29,560
and then I found out we could actually
shoot bucks her dose and and he turns out

2679
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:29,851
and he goes,

2680
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:30,500
do you want to shoot a doe?

2681
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,170
I go,

2682
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,040
fuck,

2683
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:32,371
yeah,

2684
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,204
I want to shoot.

2685
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:35,950
I'll shoot out a.

2686
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,660
that's a big issue for a lot of
people are gonna shoot a girl.

2687
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:39,841
Well,

2688
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:41,970
you know what else is interesting about
where we were hunting as they were

2689
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:43,590
talking about the huge winter kills.

2690
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,140
Most of those mule dealer don't
make it through the winter

2691
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:49,650
cold more than predators.

2692
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,530
Although we did find
some mountain line shits.

2693
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,330
We found some big fat,

2694
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:56,400
thick shit feeling filled with hair.

2695
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:56,851
Really?

2696
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:57,360
Yeah.

2697
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:57,631
Yeah.

2698
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:58,201
He was like,

2699
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:58,531
man,

2700
01:13:58,531 --> 01:14:01,170
he goes out to either one hell
of a coyote or a mountain lion.

2701
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,520
It goes most likely amount line.

2702
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:03,840
It's pretty big piece of shit.

2703
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:04,770
Wow.

2704
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:09,690
Big Fat Mountain Lion Asshole was as
big as the shift that you took of me.

2705
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,530
Uh,

2706
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,290
no.

2707
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,280
Was different than your shit.

2708
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,410
It was more like Midi.

2709
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:14,110
Yeah,

2710
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,570
they don't have any fucking
vegetables or oatmeal in there.

2711
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:17,380
Yeah,

2712
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:17,800
that's true.

2713
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:20,860
I took a photo of Brian
Shit and we played a flag.

2714
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,840
He made a tin foil flag,

2715
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,660
posted planet it next to my shit,

2716
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,583
but I did this.

2717
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:29,800
I did a launch and presented it
to him and he took a picture.

2718
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,460
Hey Buddy.

2719
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,720
Well I was gonna say on twitter that
Brian took the shit off the Missouri River

2720
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:38,010
and we put a flag next to it.

2721
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:39,220
If you can go find it,

2722
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,890
I'll give you a thousand dollars.

2723
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,420
And I was going to have a twitter
contest to find brands shit.

2724
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:45,190
But you have to use these,

2725
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,360
these waste bags.

2726
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:48,790
You can't just leave your shit
laying around on the Missouri River.

2727
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:49,760
It's foul.

2728
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:54,590
You have to dig it up and put it in these
waste bags or shit in the bag itself.

2729
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:58,120
And the bag has like some
powdered chemical in it
that kills the smell and use

2730
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,110
zip it up and seal it.

2731
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:02,340
So we had to essentially carry
five days worth of shits with us.

2732
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:04,023
The whole thing was,

2733
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,000
is living like that
was really fascinating.

2734
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:07,541
And Man,

2735
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:10,060
when we got back to that
hotel room on the fifth day,

2736
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:10,441
we,

2737
01:15:10,441 --> 01:15:10,840
we,

2738
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,201
we,

2739
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:11,740
uh,

2740
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:12,050
we,

2741
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:12,940
we landed our boats.

2742
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:16,350
We traveled like 40 something
miles by canoe and you know,

2743
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:18,640
everyday it was like six miles hiking.

2744
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,830
And when we got back stunk,

2745
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,030
stunk,

2746
01:15:22,030 --> 01:15:22,690
terrible.

2747
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,370
But when I got in that shower,

2748
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:25,151
oh my God,

2749
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:26,190
I was so appreciative.

2750
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,880
We had a great meal with the wine.

2751
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,023
It was great.

2752
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,520
What was the name of
that place we went to?

2753
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,010
I think,

2754
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,660
what was it called?

2755
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,291
It's really good.

2756
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,680
It was Walter.

2757
01:15:33,740 --> 01:15:34,370
Walter's.

2758
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:35,380
No walkers,

2759
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,273
walkers.

2760
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,370
Really Nice people too.

2761
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:38,430
Great play built,

2762
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:39,221
built like billings.

2763
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:40,220
Montana is like,

2764
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,250
surprisingly like diverse.

2765
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,050
We saw a black guy there,

2766
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:47,700
a couple of black guys
saw several gay general,

2767
01:15:47,701 --> 01:15:49,150
a lot of gay jumping at the,

2768
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:49,570
uh,

2769
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,650
who are sitting at our table in fact at
one point and sound more working at a as

2770
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:54,100
waiters.

2771
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,400
And I felt at home I was like this,

2772
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,580
it looks like la or New York.

2773
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,660
It was a gay guy.

2774
01:15:58,661 --> 01:16:00,090
Was swabbing gossip with me.

2775
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:00,830
It was awesome.

2776
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:01,510
It was telling him,

2777
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:02,350
Oh yes,

2778
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,270
he was telling me about
this one and that one,

2779
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:07,780
and then there was the guy that we met
that had a stroke because he did too much

2780
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:08,520
math.

2781
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,220
I remember him,

2782
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:09,911
handsome guy,

2783
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:10,800
but he just had a stroke.

2784
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:12,520
Fucking meth is bad.

2785
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:14,280
Folks never did math and went,

2786
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:14,591
you know,

2787
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:15,401
when everything worked out,

2788
01:16:15,401 --> 01:16:18,550
I feel that this dude got a stroke
from Matthew was 23 years old.

2789
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:20,020
He had a fucking meth stroke.

2790
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:21,281
Like whoa.

2791
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:22,114
So he's a,

2792
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:23,920
he's a recovering from that.

2793
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:24,280
But,

2794
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,810
but like the kitchen is like,

2795
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,200
you know,

2796
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,640
they were all like hipsters working there.

2797
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:30,340
The chef at this big knife
tattoo on his forearm,

2798
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:30,900
you know,

2799
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:31,230
it's like,

2800
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:32,230
it's really interesting.

2801
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:32,711
Like you're here,

2802
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:35,710
you are in this what used to
be thought of as a cow town,

2803
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,270
like a classic cowtown in billings,

2804
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:37,930
Montana.

2805
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,270
But in fact it's like
really kind of a cool town.

2806
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:41,850
A lot of cool and interesting Peter,

2807
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,581

2808
01:16:42,581 --> 01:16:44,110
hidden gems like that in this country.

2809
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,060

unbelievable little town.

01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:24,480

Who owns it?

2843
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah.

2844
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,140
Gotham is a great club.

2845
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:31,970
It's another one of the best clubs.

2846
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,250
Took one of the best clubs.

2847
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,360
I think my favorite place
to play in New York.

2848
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:37,430
I used to do caroline's
when I came into town,

2849
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,330
but caroline's has that stage.

2850
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,730
It's so small.

2851
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:45,110
I'm actually hosting on Thursday the
15th I'm hosting got live at Gotham,

2852
01:17:45,111 --> 01:17:46,100

01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:47,053
Oh yeah,

2854
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:47,541

2855
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:48,500

2860
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:56,391
It was fun.

2861
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:57,030
I did.

2862
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,200
Yeah,

2863
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,561
you did it.

2864
01:17:57,561 --> 01:17:57,921
In fact,

2865
01:17:57,921 --> 01:17:59,540
I was with you when you.

2866
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,900
I wasn't even doing standup and you got
up and did a sat there a long time ago.

2867
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,113
Yeah,

2868
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:04,731
he killed it.

2869
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:05,630
It was me and patty.

2870
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:07,690
We watched you and a profit patty,

2871
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,300
powerful batteries and you
should get her on that podcast.

2872
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,253
She's fucking.

2873
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,320
Would love to talk about
the afterlife on my podcast.

2874
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,030
She was so fucking good.

2875
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:22,090
Patty's Patty's Brian's a ex girlfriend
who's also a brilliant director.

2876
01:18:22,371 --> 01:18:23,580
Just a fascinating trip.

2877
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:26,060
She is so rare because she's very.

2878
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,230
She's so very dude.

2879
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:28,000
Like,

2880
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,660
like when you're having
conversations with her,

2881
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,470
like yeah,

2882
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:31,380
she's very dude.

2883
01:18:31,381 --> 01:18:31,760
Like,

2884
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,250
like what she was describing to me like,

2885
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:34,460
like situations,

2886
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:37,150
like actress breakdowns
and craziness and you know,

2887
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:37,580
her,

2888
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:40,640
the kind of stuff that she has
to manage being a director.

2889
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:42,170
Like sometimes it's like babysitting,

2890
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:42,800
you know,

2891
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:47,660
like we always hear like Kevin pollock
was on Opie and Anthony yesterday and was

2892
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:51,440
talking about some instances he had on
a set with Michael Clarke Duncan being a

2893
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:54,890
diva and he told the whole story about
it and even after the guy was dead,

2894
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:55,580
you know,

2895
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:58,730
but it's like they all
have these fucking stories.

2896
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,020
Like every director,

2897
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,520
every person who works a set,

2898
01:19:01,521 --> 01:19:03,430
they all have these nutty stories of some.

2899
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:07,520
David just told me that he
interviewed me on his podcast.

2900
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,630
Lorenzo Lamas,

2901
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:08,901

2902
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:10,370

2904
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,890
which I'm posting today.

2905
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,990
You guys might of like how he talks.

2906
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,960
He went to a psychiatrist of and you
know what the psychiatrist said after 20

2907
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:18,171
minutes.

2908
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:18,650
He goes,

2909
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:18,910
ah,

2910
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:19,950
I see what's going on here.

2911
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:20,510
He goes,

2912
01:19:20,510 --> 01:19:21,150
what?

2913
01:19:21,150 --> 01:19:21,770
He goes,

2914
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,900
you actually don't think
you have a right to be born.

2915
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,340
I mean,

2916
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:24,710
you don't,

2917
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:26,240
you don't think you have a right to exist.

2918
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:27,080
Is that how you feel?

2919
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,953
That was like,

2920
01:19:28,580 --> 01:19:28,761
yeah,

2921
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:29,840
that's exactly how I feel.

2922
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:30,200
Yeah.

2923
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,020
Yeah.

2924
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:31,850
Really?

2925
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:32,031
Yeah.

2926
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:33,650
We talked about it in a fucking podcast.

2927
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,490
Davidoff doesn't feel like
he should have the right to,

2928
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:37,360
you know,

2929
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,270
how he grew up at the very.

2930
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:38,481
It's,

2931
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,610
it's his fucking life.

2932
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,090
I mean,

2933
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,390
Renee Zellweger starring and
directing the movie of his life.

2934
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,000
She's playing,

2935
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
just playing the girl that likes him.

2936
01:19:47,001 --> 01:19:47,360
Love Him.

2937
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:47,921
She's playing dumb.

2938
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:48,880

Or as he,

2953
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:05,390
he,

2954
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:05,821
he,

2955
01:20:05,821 --> 01:20:07,320
it was initially his thing and he can't.

2956
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:10,950
And I put them together with Anthony Tan
back is my buddy wrote warrior and then

2957
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,420
he was saying,

2958
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:11,590
hey,

2959
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:15,030
anthony is such a bad ass writer mean
he fucking every drafted come up with.

2960
01:20:15,031 --> 01:20:15,391
You'd be like,

2961
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:16,770
how the fuck do you write?

2962
01:20:16,771 --> 01:20:20,940
This warrior was a strange movie because
it didn't get the attention that I

2963
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:21,774
thought it deserved.

2964
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:22,720
I saw them moving.

2965
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:23,011
I was like,

2966
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:23,251
wow,

2967
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:23,940
that's going to be a,

2968
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,380
that's going to be a big hit movie.

2969
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,990
The only problem with that movie
was the two day fighting thing.

2970
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:28,190
They,

2971
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:29,310
they fought two days in a row.

2972
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:29,911
I was like,

2973
01:20:29,911 --> 01:20:30,181
man,

2974
01:20:30,181 --> 01:20:31,650
I felt like he could have got around that,

2975
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:32,070
you know,

2976
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,320
like had everything up to that.

2977
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,520
I mean it was really,

2978
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:39,810
there was some cliched
topics and cliched angles,

2979
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,710
but it was done so fucking.

2980
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,170
Well.

2981
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,230
Everybody from Nick naulty
down to the two brothers.

2982
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:46,501
I mean,

2983
01:20:46,501 --> 01:20:47,940
it was really done well.

2984
01:20:47,941 --> 01:20:49,320
It was a great fucking movie.

2985
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:50,580
I enjoyed the shit out of it,

2986
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:51,060
man.

2987
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:52,290
And my wife enjoyed it.

2988
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:55,590
She doesn't really like even like tested
higher with women than it did with men.

2989
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:56,041
It's good.

2990
01:20:56,041 --> 01:20:58,470
Fucking movie was good fucking movie,

2991
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:00,330
but for whatever reason
it just disappeared.

2992
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,140
Like I didn't get it.

2993
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:01,400
I was,

2994
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:02,580
I was confused.

2995
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:04,650
There's a lot of times that happens man,

2996
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:07,710
where a movie like this
will just slip through.

2997
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:08,620
And a movie like that too.

2998
01:21:08,621 --> 01:21:11,940
It was so epic and so much was put into
it and I made $6,000,000 or something

2999
01:21:11,941 --> 01:21:12,774
until the weekend.

3000
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,340
It's just such a heartbreak,

3001
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:14,880
you know?

3002
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:16,200
It's too bad I don't get it.

3003
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:17,011
I would have,

3004
01:21:17,011 --> 01:21:18,690
I would've thought that
movie would have taken off.

3005
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,100
Maybe it's just people were just like,

3006
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:21,863
Whoa,

3007
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:22,690
we got a problem.

3008
01:21:22,690 --> 01:21:23,280
Brian.

3009
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,180
The thing just popped.

3010
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:25,890
Really launched as the headphone Jack.

3011
01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:28,110
I think it is actually.

3012
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:28,944
That's what it really.

3013
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:29,911
Brian,

3014
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:30,744
how do you know?

3015
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,920
Oh you fuck you're moving things.

3016
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:35,970
That's why it's popping.

3017
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,360
Ha solved the problem.

3018
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:40,920
Son of a bitch.

3019
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:42,420
This is a new thing actually that we got.

3020
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,430
I ordered one of those studio.

3021
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:47,791
Anyway.

3022
01:21:47,791 --> 01:21:48,624
Where were we?

3023
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:51,630
I'm talking about

3024
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,070
the movie only made $6,000,000
and it's heartbreak.

3025
01:21:56,071 --> 01:21:58,620
It's either writing anything in life and,

3026
01:21:58,621 --> 01:21:59,281
and you know,

3027
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:02,490
doing a movie or I didn't and it
takes a long time building a business.

3028
01:22:02,491 --> 01:22:03,900
It's all an act of faith man.

3029
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:04,501
And guess what?

3030
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:06,390
Sometimes it just doesn't fucking work.

3031
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:10,530
You just also problem is you're dealing
with a giant group of people and trying

3032
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:11,790
to everybody's vision,

3033
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:16,560
trying to funnel them into one
sort of cohesive laser beam.

3034
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,360
Listen man.

3035
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,390
It's like I told you I had to sit
down with Mr Arnold Schwarzenegger.

3036
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,840
Just just me,

3037
01:22:21,841 --> 01:22:22,674
him,

3038
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:24,083
John,

3039
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,260
John Leguizamo.

3040
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,180
You had a good time,

3041
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:27,540
Huh?

3042
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,600
Well now what was the reason I bring
it up as he was talking about being

3043
01:22:30,601 --> 01:22:34,980
governor for eight years and how
fucking getting anything done.

3044
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,470
It was basically impossible,

3045
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,300
so he'd have a really
common sense measure,

3046
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:44,280
let's say measuring the groundwater for
farmers because we can use more of that

3047
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:45,480
water to go,

3048
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:45,961
you know,

3049
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:46,910
we can use the.

3050
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,000
We don't need all this water,

3051
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:51,390
let's measure the ground you and we'll
siphon the rest off and La and the

3052
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:52,290
farmers look at him and go,

3053
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,310
oh,

3054
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,530
that's not going to happen.

3055
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:55,330
It's like,

3056
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:55,980
what do you mean?

3057
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,380
It's common sense will be right back.

3058
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:03,010
Three hours later at seven Republican
senators up in his office got Mr. Ms Dot

3059
01:23:03,011 --> 01:23:03,300
Gov.

3060
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,710
You can't tell you we're not
going to the ground water.

3061
01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:05,980
It's not

3062
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,311
going to happen,

3063
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:09,640
but here's what we'll do you you call
for a measuring of the groundwater and

3064
01:23:09,641 --> 01:23:13,690
we'll act like a basically when and then
the farmers won't let us on the land.

3065
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,860
Everybody went down and you get it.

3066
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,461
You get it now.

3067
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:15,841
How's that?

3068
01:23:15,841 --> 01:23:16,510
Ha Ha.

3069
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:17,370
He's literally saying it's.

3070
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:20,380
You're dealing with such
powerful special interests.

3071
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,900
He said the only thing I could
do as a governor was Vito Shit,

3072
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:23,441
you know,

3073
01:23:23,441 --> 01:23:23,911
and he.

3074
01:23:23,911 --> 01:23:25,060
So by the way,

3075
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:25,900
talking to him,

3076
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,850
he's so socially liberal.

3077
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:28,211
He's,

3078
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,350
I mean I'm right down the,

3079
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,330
this guy he's talking about,

3080
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,710
he's just fiscally conservative.

3081
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:36,490
He's talking about the insanity of the
pull yourself up by the seat of your

3082
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:37,210
pants,

3083
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,770
but he's also very socially liberal.

3084
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:39,521
He believes in like,

3085
01:23:39,521 --> 01:23:39,760
you know,

3086
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:40,541
marriage and.

3087
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:40,841
Yeah.

3088
01:23:40,841 --> 01:23:43,420
And also like he believes that we should
do something about global warming.

3089
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:44,470
He's got regulations.

3090
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,681
He's a,

3091
01:23:44,681 --> 01:23:45,470
he's a very.

3092
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:46,181
I'm right there.

3093
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:47,770
I'm right with them on practically.

3094
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:50,760
And as he was speaking he
was just so fair minded and,

3095
01:23:50,761 --> 01:23:53,350
and but common sense measures,

3096
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:57,340
common sense farming policy in this
country where you don't subsidize huge

3097
01:23:57,341 --> 01:23:58,240
factory farms.

3098
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,770
Try doing that sometime.

3099
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:00,670
Try getting elected.

3100
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,950
They just,

3101
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,150
this shit is the,

3102
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,020
these people spend all day.

3103
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:06,970
Do they spend all day
down in Capital Hill?

3104
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,500
When's the last time you were petitioning?

3105
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,450
Capitalist system is stupid.

3106
01:24:10,570 --> 01:24:11,500
It's really stupid.

3107
01:24:11,501 --> 01:24:11,891
But you got,

3108
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:14,740
you got big labor unions that
can make or break your election.

3109
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:15,300
You have.

3110
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,400
Obama's had been talking about special
interest groups who's been talking about

3111
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:19,510
getting where the lobbyists,

3112
01:24:19,910 --> 01:24:20,500
you know,

3113
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:20,760
it's,

3114
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,140
it's hard though because constitutionally
you're allowed to petition your

3115
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:23,561
government.

3116
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:24,640
So how do you get around that?

3117
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:25,240
I don't know.

3118
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:30,240
I mean there is a way constitutionally
the bill of rights used to also have a

3119
01:24:30,761 --> 01:24:35,280
lot of shit and it's not there
anymore because of Patriot Act Nda.

3120
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,030
You could easily fix that too.

3121
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:37,960
You could just,

3122
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,360
it seems like the idea of a lobbyist,

3123
01:24:40,370 --> 01:24:41,830
it should be completely illegal.

3124
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:44,860
It should be completely illegal that you
can have something wrong with the fact

3125
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:47,800
that all those counties around capital
hill or the wealthiest counties and they

3126
01:24:47,801 --> 01:24:50,230
don't produce a goddamn thing
just as lawyers and lobbyists,

3127
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,640
they don't produce anything.

3128
01:24:51,910 --> 01:24:53,020
What they do is they go,

3129
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:56,080
they and holding up the various
companies and they go and say,

3130
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:56,351
Hey,

3131
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:56,890
Mr,

3132
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:57,661
Mr Sen,

3133
01:24:57,661 --> 01:24:58,180
uh,

3134
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,000
you need to vote for this because
it'll bring a lot of jobs also to your

3135
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:01,834
constituency.

3136
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:05,710
We need a new airplane and
Boeing happens to have a plant.

3137
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:06,430
There you will,

3138
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:07,900
you'll hire 1100 people.

3139
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,030
Just vote for it.

3140
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:09,700
Yeah.

3141
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,370
They don't look weak on defense system,

3142
01:25:12,371 --> 01:25:13,204
gangsters,

3143
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:17,560
they find a system and they exploit
the weaknesses in the system and that's

3144
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:18,520
where we're at.

3145
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,070
So we have to deal with all
these weaknesses and he can't.

3146
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:22,240
He can't just say,

3147
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:22,691
well,

3148
01:25:22,691 --> 01:25:23,141
you know,

3149
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:24,040
this is fine.

3150
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:27,100
We just need to add
some more laws and the,

3151
01:25:27,230 --> 01:25:27,551
no,

3152
01:25:27,551 --> 01:25:27,791
no,

3153
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,001
no,

3154
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:28,190
no.

3155
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:30,490
You gotta do it shouldn't
be the whole thing.

3156
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,473
Should be.

3157
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,620
It shouldn't be parsed down to some
really simple language and you need to get

3158
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:40,180
all outside influence out of it.

3159
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:44,700
It has to completely be the will of the
people and if people choose to act like

3160
01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:45,700
in groups as far as like,

3161
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:46,040
you know,

3162
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:48,770
religious groups on a
boycott things or you know,

3163
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,690
certain people,

3164
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:53,560
gay and lesbian people want to support
things so they support gay marriage.

3165
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:54,131
That's fine,

3166
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:55,150
that's all good organized,

3167
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:56,200
do whatever the fuck you want to do,

3168
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:01,440
but the idea that you can get to the
actual politicians get special favors.

3169
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:03,920
Yeah.

3170
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,370
That's

3171
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,840
database to make money.

3172
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:06,231
That's great.

3173
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:06,831
You make money.

3174
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:07,664
That's crazy.

3175
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,690
That doesn't make any sense.

3176
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:08,891
That's,

3177
01:26:08,891 --> 01:26:09,724
that's ridiculous.

3178
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:10,580
It should be illegal.

3179
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:11,990
How is that not legal,

3180
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:13,790
but yet insider trading is.

3181
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:15,170
That doesn't make any sense.

3182
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:17,120
That's not illegal,

3183
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,250
but not illegal.

3184
01:26:19,251 --> 01:26:19,570
I met.

3185
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:20,020
How is that?

3186
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,260
Not only was I should've said,

3187
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:24,390
how is that because you're legal
and insider trading is illegal.

3188
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:25,071
I mean it's,

3189
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:26,370
it's essentially you're,

3190
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,650
it's all stealing.

3191
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,600
It's finding all these numbers and pulling
them out of the system and sticking

3192
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:33,440
them into your account.

3193
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:35,450
It's like you're doing some crazy shit.

3194
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:38,870
You're influencing the way America runs.

3195
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,790
Like literally democracy means freedom.

3196
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:42,800
You're influencing
personal freedom for sure,

3197
01:26:42,801 --> 01:26:47,210
but how many people are in private
prisons right now due to nonviolent drug

3198
01:26:47,211 --> 01:26:51,260
offenses that are a direct result of
lobbyists pushing for certain things to

3199
01:26:51,261 --> 01:26:53,480
remain illegal that is clear,

3200
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:58,481
that is money influencing people's freedom
that is literally shifting in degrees

3201
01:26:59,061 --> 01:27:00,230
left or to the right,

3202
01:27:00,231 --> 01:27:00,501
you know,

3203
01:27:00,501 --> 01:27:03,740
as far as plus or minus how
many people are incarcerated.

3204
01:27:03,770 --> 01:27:04,581
That strikes me,

3205
01:27:04,581 --> 01:27:04,911
what you're,

3206
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:08,300
what you're saying strikes
me as the most important.

3207
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:13,540
I believe that.

3208
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:13,811
And,

3209
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:14,201
and,

3210
01:27:14,201 --> 01:27:14,480
uh,

3211
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:14,820
you know,

3212
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,590
I think it was James Madison said
that special interest groups are,

3213
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:20,110
have always been the threat to
this form of system of government.

3214
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:20,501
However,

3215
01:27:20,501 --> 01:27:21,670
they'll cancel each other out,

3216
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:22,511
but you know,

3217
01:27:22,511 --> 01:27:26,350
it's not happening in the
group that has the strongest,

3218
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:27,430
you know,

3219
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,731
look at,

3220
01:27:27,731 --> 01:27:29,080
look at what organized labor.

3221
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:29,891
I'm part of a union,

3222
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:31,120
so I understand unions,

3223
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:32,500
but some of these,

3224
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:35,110
some of these fucking
labor unions are just in.

3225
01:27:35,111 --> 01:27:36,340
I was talking to
Schwarzenegger about this.

3226
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,360
They're,

3227
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:37,820
they're,

3228
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,440
they're literally lobbying and they,

3229
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:40,151
and they get it.

3230
01:27:40,151 --> 01:27:42,670
They lobby for when they retire after 15,

3231
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:43,504
20 years.

3232
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:46,570
They get 95 percent of their salary or
whatever it is for the rest of their

3233
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:47,020
lives.

3234
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:47,710
Now that,

3235
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:48,520
who says,

3236
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,520
we can't afford that
if bankrupt the state,

3237
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:53,920
they have bankrupt the state.

3238
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:55,000
It's not just,

3239
01:27:55,001 --> 01:27:55,161
it's,

3240
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:59,110
it's all different kinds of organized
groups of labor who look at the,

3241
01:27:59,111 --> 01:28:01,720
look at what the auto united
auto workers union did to itself.

3242
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:02,180
You,

3243
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:05,530
you could retire with 95 percent of your
pension for the rest of your life and

3244
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:07,750
your whole family had benefits
for the rest of their lives.

3245
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,613
What are you talking about?

3246
01:28:08,770 --> 01:28:09,011
No,

3247
01:28:09,011 --> 01:28:09,730
you can't afford.

3248
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:14,730
You couldn't sell enough cars to support
your pension plan states the truth.

3249
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:16,570
That's exactly what,

3250
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:16,641
how,

3251
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:17,120
what happened?

3252
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:17,900
The five percent,

3253
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,210
95 percent of your salary.

3254
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:19,271
You.

3255
01:28:19,271 --> 01:28:21,160
So are you going to go out
and look for another job?

3256
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,113
Of course not.

3257
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:22,640
And,

3258
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:22,851
and,

3259
01:28:22,851 --> 01:28:24,220
and this is exactly what,

3260
01:28:24,221 --> 01:28:25,054
what happened with

3261
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,390
these big Dildo in their point of view,

3262
01:28:27,420 --> 01:28:30,810
they're busting their ass for 20 years
making millions of dollars for Chevrolet

3263
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:31,320
the point,

3264
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,850
because give me my money,

3265
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:33,990
I couldn't afford it.

3266
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,220
They bankrupted the company.

3267
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,190
Sons of bitches should have
made some better cars to what?

3268
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:38,500
What I was talking about,

3269
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,333
what?

3270
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:42,780
They should have thrown all this other
shit boxes out and everybody would have

3271
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:43,890
had corvettes just

3272
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,380
more cheaper.

3273
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,500
Even that their product was so bad and
they're making really good products now

3274
01:28:48,501 --> 01:28:51,770
is that they can't afford
their retirement pool.

3275
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,550
So it just,

3276
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:53,180
by the way,

3277
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:54,013
by the way,

3278
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:57,430
the same thing goes for almost every
county in this fucking great state of

3279
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,490
California.

3280
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:02,070
California economically
looks a lot like grease

3281
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:02,611
and you know,

3282
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:04,230
told me that Arnold Schwarzenegger.

3283
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:04,810
But you know,

3284
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:05,430
I,

3285
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,330
I also read that.

3286
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:07,680
I also read that Michael Lewis's book.

3287
01:29:07,681 --> 01:29:09,030
We did an exhaustive study on it,

3288
01:29:09,270 --> 01:29:10,290
California.

3289
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,760
Do you think Michael Lewis gets any pussy?

3290
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,510
I was just a cell phone number.

3291
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,370
So smart.

3292
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,190
Just looking at kind of a
cool app from what I eat.

3293
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:17,151
I've seen pictures.

3294
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:18,660
It's kind of like a regular looking,

3295
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:19,660
pretty cool looking dude.

3296
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:20,120
I mean,

3297
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:20,760
yeah,

3298
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,390
some people,

3299
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:23,970
some people write huge books
and get laid all the time.

3300
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:24,750
That's ridiculous.

3301
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:25,270
I hate them.

3302
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:26,460
Sons of bitches funnier.

3303
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:28,860
You hope you never know.

3304
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:31,050
It's always good to be
around people who are.

3305
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,040
You're a little in awe of who just are
better at supporting to be around people

3306
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:35,900
that are good at shit too.

3307
01:29:36,350 --> 01:29:36,661
You know?

3308
01:29:36,661 --> 01:29:36,871
Uh,

3309
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,630
I did San Francisco and
Seattle this past weekend.

3310
01:29:39,631 --> 01:29:41,610
We did it with Brian and Greg Fitzsimmons.

3311
01:29:41,611 --> 01:29:43,690
Greg Fitzsimmons is fucking funny.

3312
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:44,310
Funny.

3313
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,143
He's always been.

3314
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:46,111
He's always been funny,

3315
01:29:46,111 --> 01:29:48,090
but he's got this new level of,

3316
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:49,500
I don't give a fuck that,

3317
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,040
you know,

3318
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:51,900
I haven't seen from him before.

3319
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:52,231
He,

3320
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:54,390
he took it to the next level this weekend.

3321
01:29:54,391 --> 01:29:55,224
He's great.

3322
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,580
This past weekend was awesome.

3323
01:29:56,581 --> 01:30:00,540
He was really funny in Seattle
to do like a half hour.

3324
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:01,200
That's great.

3325
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:01,411
Yeah,

3326
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:02,244
it was awesome.

3327
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:02,821
Killer.

3328
01:30:02,821 --> 01:30:03,660
It's just like my.

3329
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,420
It's like my style of comedy
that I enjoy watching.

3330
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:09,480
Just like really ridiculous of rude,

3331
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:10,250
honest,

3332
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:10,760
hilarious,

3333
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:11,710
descriptive.

3334
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,560
It was really fun.

3335
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:14,070
It's like,

3336
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,341
you know,

3337
01:30:14,341 --> 01:30:17,220
like there's certain types of music,

3338
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:17,461
you know,

3339
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:19,470
like if you go to a club to see music,

3340
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:22,470
it's never just live music and you take
a guess is whether or not it's going to

3341
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:24,000
be hip hop or country western,

3342
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:25,680
but what standup comedy is like?

3343
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:27,810
We don't really have genres,

3344
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:28,361
you know,

3345
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:30,810
you like you could call
someone to shop comic,

3346
01:30:30,811 --> 01:30:31,261
which is,

3347
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:31,950
you know,

3348
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:34,560
derogatory really to a lot of folks.

3349
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,330
But me,

3350
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:35,600
mom,

3351
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:37,980
my favorite comics would
be classified in the shock,

3352
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:38,940
comma category.

3353
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,170
Like dice clay,

3354
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:41,970
like you call them a shock comic.

3355
01:30:41,971 --> 01:30:46,971
I think he creates ridiculous scenarios
that are disgusting and Hilarious.

3356
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,421
A lot of us think,

3357
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,254
but don't say,

3358
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:49,660
uh,

3359
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:50,220
by the blade.

3360
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,840
It's a fucking work of art.

3361
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:52,051
Okay.

3362
01:30:52,051 --> 01:30:53,040
He's a character.

3363
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:54,540
His name isn't even Andrew dice clay.

3364
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:55,650
He's made a character.

3365
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:56,310
He's,

3366
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,150
he does it onstage.

3367
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:01,500
He's got giant glasses on and he
says ridiculous shit like that.

3368
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,850
You can't just diminish that by calling
it shock comedy because to me it's not,

3369
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:06,930
it's a style of comedy.

3370
01:31:06,931 --> 01:31:07,980
It's a legit style.

3371
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:08,400
Yeah.

3372
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,900
But we don't have labels,

3373
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:10,130
you know,

3374
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:12,720
it's like there's certain
types of comedy where,

3375
01:31:12,721 --> 01:31:13,090
you know,

3376
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:15,000
you and I were talking also about how,

3377
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:19,290
what a privilege it is to feel it to be
a headliner and to be somebody who gets

3378
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:20,520
to perform all over the country.

3379
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,250
And like sometimes I look at,

3380
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:23,010
I was in Miami,

3381
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,030
Fort Lauderdale and I just,

3382
01:31:24,170 --> 01:31:24,380
you know,

3383
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:24,900
it was,

3384
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,670
I did at one point,

3385
01:31:26,671 --> 01:31:29,200
I just had them going pretty
strong and I just looked at,

3386
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:29,461
I was like,

3387
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:31,890
I felt like the luckiest human
being in the fucking world.

3388
01:31:31,891 --> 01:31:32,724
That's why when I watch

3389
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:33,740
at Makani,

3390
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,760
he fucking magic mike and his fucking
leather chest girdle and it's fucking hot

3391
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:43,700
pants and any and he's coming off say,

3392
01:31:46,270 --> 01:31:47,390
hey yoker boy,

3393
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,381
come flocking.

3394
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:49,730
Do 10 minutes of stand up.

3395
01:31:49,731 --> 01:31:50,600
You fucking idiot.

3396
01:31:50,601 --> 01:31:54,080
I don't jump off stage like I just did
an hour and a half and crossing somebody

3397
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:55,700
hugged me hard so I can kiss your mouth.

3398
01:31:55,720 --> 01:31:56,553
This animosity

3399
01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:59,410
attracted him.

3400
01:31:59,411 --> 01:31:59,840
Alright.

3401
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:00,673
Expressed.

3402
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:01,421
I hate them.

3403
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:02,140
I mean I hate him.

3404
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:02,973
I hate him.

3405
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:04,340
No,

3406
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,910
I was just thinking about how you're.

3407
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:09,160
You're an actor and you have five
scenes in a movie and be like,

3408
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:09,491
Whoa.

3409
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:09,851
You were great.

3410
01:32:09,851 --> 01:32:11,170
In that movie it,

3411
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,850
you collectively are probably doing
10 or 15 minutes of actual activity.

3412
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:17,140
Whereas when you do stand up,

3413
01:32:17,141 --> 01:32:17,830
you're out there for.

3414
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:18,250
You know,

3415
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:19,240
it's just a different.

3416
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:20,410
It's just a different thing.

3417
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,660
Feels it feels a little.

3418
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,160
Why would you care though
that he wants to be because

3419
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,060
it was a matter what's going on now.

3420
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,350
I just saw the movie and I was just.

3421
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:30,310
I was just looking at him going,

3422
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:30,790
you're just,

3423
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:33,100
you took this movie just so
you could wear those outfits.

3424
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,360
He gave you the biggest boner.

3425
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,000
Did he?

3426
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,100
He did.

3427
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:36,610
If I was,

3428
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:37,540
if I was gay,

3429
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,351
I would definitely.

3430
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:39,880
He's a very attractive one.

3431
01:32:39,881 --> 01:32:42,640
Would you choose I Mike channing tatum.

3432
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:43,060
Really?

3433
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:43,893
My boyfriend.

3434
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,210
You kidneys got full mouth.

3435
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,090
Best genetics.

3436
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:47,450
He's got sick lips.

3437
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:50,230
The eyes out of the cat eyes.

3438
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:51,550
Seems confident too.

3439
01:32:51,610 --> 01:32:52,421
He's a great guy.

3440
01:32:52,421 --> 01:32:54,160
He's got a big cost sense of humor.

3441
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:57,690
We're both really something
Joe Rogan a bronc allocate.

3442
01:32:57,730 --> 01:32:59,730
It gets talking about channing tatum cost.

3443
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:00,613
So

3444
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:02,850
that just came out of here.

3445
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:03,650
Here's my bet.

3446
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,530
He's got a big truck.

3447
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:08,170
Did you watch the uh,

3448
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,500
the actual whole moving because I
wanted to annoy myself more and more.

3449
01:33:11,710 --> 01:33:13,650
Although I thought the movie
was good and I liked it.

3450
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:14,260
I liked,

3451
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,160
I liked channing tatum.

3452
01:33:15,530 --> 01:33:16,930
I mean I had my hands.

3453
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,410
That movie looks so gig channels.

3454
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:23,950
I was flipping through the channels
and I saw it popped up and I went whoa.

3455
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:25,740
Change a quick like you know,

3456
01:33:25,741 --> 01:33:30,430
how you flipping through like you have
previewing next preview at a hotel,

3457
01:33:30,431 --> 01:33:33,150
what was checking into a
hotel and like I was like,

3458
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:33,890
this is so gay.

3459
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:34,723
I got to get it off.

3460
01:33:34,870 --> 01:33:37,810
Like dudes were like
gyrating back and forth.

3461
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:38,600
Which by the way,

3462
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,630
I think women like that.

3463
01:33:40,631 --> 01:33:43,150
I think that motion is
really just isolated.

3464
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:44,290
Someone Riding Dick's.

3465
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:45,490
I don't think that.

3466
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:48,300
I know gyrating like the
way a guy's doing it.

3467
01:33:48,490 --> 01:33:51,010
Women like the rusting
they like to get fucked.

3468
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:51,500
They don't.

3469
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,333
They want you,

3470
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,930
your Dick Riding circled man.

3471
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,551
Dick Riding,

3472
01:33:57,551 --> 01:33:58,384
sweaty circle.

3473
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,401
Connie's too.

3474
01:33:59,401 --> 01:34:03,940
And he's got a fucking a leather thong
and he's doing back bends and shit and,

3475
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:04,301
and,

3476
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:05,530
but the character I was watching,

3477
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:06,850
what bothered me was I was watching.

3478
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,300
I go,

3479
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:08,133
you know,

3480
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:08,973
as an actor,

3481
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,180
if I took that role,

3482
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,770
there's a lot I do with that role.

3483
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:12,131
May Be,

3484
01:34:12,131 --> 01:34:14,140
but I wouldn't because
there's not a lot to do.

3485
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:14,740
Like he played it.

3486
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:15,460
Just one note,

3487
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,520
shut the fuck up bitch.

3488
01:34:16,521 --> 01:34:21,521
She would take that role at a God damn
heartbeat tatum and your underwear can be

3489
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:22,481
your boyfriend.

3490
01:34:22,481 --> 01:34:26,070
He'd be carrying them around like he
was crossing the wedding nuptials.

3491
01:34:26,071 --> 01:34:28,380
I would look like I have fucking
rickets next to that guy.

3492
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:30,100
So he would do the movie with them though.

3493
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:30,460
Dude,

3494
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,090
you would do it.

3495
01:34:31,090 --> 01:34:31,990
So shut the fuck up.

3496
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:33,800
Matthew mcconaughey.

3497
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:35,470
A hard time and you're doing the movie.

3498
01:34:35,471 --> 01:34:37,040
Maybe he just wanted to
meet Jenny channel to

3499
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:39,623
Matthew.

3500
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:39,990
Sorry.

3501
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,450
Rather than.

3502
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,240
I don't mean to put you down enough guy.

3503
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:44,170
I hear,

3504
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:44,531
I hear.

3505
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:45,460
He's a very nice guy.

3506
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:45,760
Yeah.

3507
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,300
Here's a nice car.

3508
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,520
Testing me and he's not really
vain and not an annoying.

3509
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,601
Well listen man,

3510
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,410
he's playing a part.

3511
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:52,840
How could you like if you
judged me based on the movies?

3512
01:34:52,841 --> 01:34:53,510
Zookeeper.

3513
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:57,710
You fucking dance in Malibu.

3514
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,220
Who Does?

3515
01:34:58,220 --> 01:34:58,730
Yeah.

3516
01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,563
With the shirt off.

3517
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:00,891
Yay.

3518
01:35:00,891 --> 01:35:01,380
Does.

3519
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:04,370
If I see you and you're doing pushups
in front of the pavilion in Malibu,

3520
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:05,420
I'm going to take your back.

3521
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,240
We're going to take you back and I'm
going to get their hooks in my French,

3522
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:10,093
kick him in the ribs.

3523
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:10,520
Just gonna.

3524
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:10,761
Hold it.

3525
01:35:10,761 --> 01:35:11,690
He can scream all you want.

3526
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:15,170
You shouldn't have been doing pushups
that a lot to do with a knapsack on,

3527
01:35:15,171 --> 01:35:18,320
with a knapsack on a Bandana was
while tourists take pictures of you,

3528
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:19,213
is that what he was doing?

3529
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:20,690
That annoys me.

3530
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:22,430
He wanted to be really fit for this movie.

3531
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:24,570
Maybe it was like something
he was working on,

3532
01:35:24,571 --> 01:35:28,670
like what kind of exhibitionist could he
become because he was playing a part in

3533
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:29,420
a movie man.

3534
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,060
Did you murder?

3535
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:31,160
He look,

3536
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:31,551
think about,

3537
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:31,930
look what,

3538
01:35:31,930 --> 01:35:32,090
what,

3539
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:33,740
what's his name does when he does.

3540
01:35:33,741 --> 01:35:34,340
Um,

3541
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:34,490
uh,

3542
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:35,151
Daniel Day Lewis,

3543
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:36,530
when he gets immersed in a role,

3544
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:36,881
he's,

3545
01:35:36,881 --> 01:35:37,220
I mean,

3546
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:38,330
he's unbelievably immersive.

3547
01:35:38,331 --> 01:35:39,680
Maybe that's what Matthew
mcconaughey was done.

3548
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:40,760
It was just being a douchebag.

3549
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:42,920
He's playing a Douche
bag in the movie man.

3550
01:35:42,921 --> 01:35:45,650
And that's douchebag activity at the
role was in so much of a Douche bag.

3551
01:35:45,651 --> 01:35:46,431
The role was more of a,

3552
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:47,870
just think he's supposed
to be the club owner,

3553
01:35:47,871 --> 01:35:48,830
but you'll see what I mean.

3554
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,520
Would it be okay if he did pushups in a
weird place where nobody could say like

3555
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:53,810
say if there was like his.

3556
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,110
There was like some grass in front of
his car and nobody could see any dropdown

3557
01:35:57,140 --> 01:35:57,830
for a quick 15.

3558
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:58,663
Here's what Bob.

3559
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:59,391
It bothers me.

3560
01:35:59,391 --> 01:35:59,840
Yes,

3561
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:00,380
there I am.

3562
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:01,213
Here's what bothers me.

3563
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:05,460
If you work out just for the sake
of vanity to and then and then it,

3564
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:05,930
I,

3565
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,520
when I see what you're doing is just,

3566
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:09,560
you're just sculpting for,

3567
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:10,700
for it to be a peacock.

3568
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:11,021
I,

3569
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:11,740
I understand.

3570
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:12,321
I get,

3571
01:36:12,321 --> 01:36:13,190
I get staying in shape.

3572
01:36:13,490 --> 01:36:14,390
There's something about it.

3573
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:16,160
If it's not for something functional,

3574
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,750
it was not for something like that.

3575
01:36:17,751 --> 01:36:18,584
You're doing.

3576
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:19,610
I immediately.

3577
01:36:19,670 --> 01:36:21,110
I'm just saying you can do it.

3578
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:22,033
You're not my friend.

3579
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,873
That's all I'm saying.

3580
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:25,970
Why is that?

3581
01:36:25,971 --> 01:36:28,640
What about a guy who's just doing
like bench presses and curls?

3582
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:29,870
Never touches the legs.

3583
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:31,580
Just wants to look good in a tight shirt,

3584
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:31,901
but he,

3585
01:36:31,901 --> 01:36:32,271
he's doing it.

3586
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:32,930
You know what you know.

3587
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:33,830
You know why I like that?

3588
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:33,951
Well,

3589
01:36:33,951 --> 01:36:34,790
I've got no problem with that.

3590
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:37,490
He's doing it so he can go out
and get laid on a Saturday night.

3591
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,170
Fucking a bless you.

3592
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,510
What do you think Matthew mcconaughey
is doing when he's wearing leather

3593
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:41,870
underwear?

3594
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:46,870
Doing that so he can fucking get
the dailies and checkoff self.

3595
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,830
That's why he's fucking doing
it and there's a difference.

3596
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,620
I see Matt Maconomy to
want a role like that.

3597
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:55,790
Magic Mike All.

3598
01:36:55,791 --> 01:36:57,560
I'm seeing something masturbatory.

3599
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:58,820
I watched channing tatum.

3600
01:36:58,850 --> 01:36:59,840
He's trying to do something.

3601
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:02,570
He's actually playing a character who's
fucking conflicted about being a 30 year

3602
01:37:02,571 --> 01:37:03,950
old stripper and it's fucking great.

3603
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,870
Makani he is is.

3604
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:08,150
It's a masturbatory performance.

3605
01:37:08,151 --> 01:37:09,620
He's watching himself.

3606
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:11,210
He's not trying to do anything.

3607
01:37:11,330 --> 01:37:12,620
He's not trying to express anything.

3608
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,500
He's trying to play.

3609
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:15,891
I mean,

3610
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:20,891
the guy has shown a pretty broad range
of angry in the world of television.

3611
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:21,800
Merriam.

3612
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:22,760
I don't want to marry him,

3613
01:37:22,761 --> 01:37:25,860
but it was really good and
contact the hell's going on.

3614
01:37:25,861 --> 01:37:26,600
It was all right.

3615
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:27,830
He was good in contact.

3616
01:37:27,831 --> 01:37:28,431
I enjoyed him.

3617
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:30,110
I thought he was sensitive about that.

3618
01:37:30,870 --> 01:37:33,590
Seemed like the type of guy that
would fall in love with Jodie foster.

3619
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:34,820
That was a long time ago.

3620
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:35,280
He listened.

3621
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,410
I can't believe you just brought that.

3622
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:37,191
He was great.

3623
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:38,780
It's amazing that even
after all those years,

3624
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:39,860
they still have such a great body.

3625
01:37:39,861 --> 01:37:40,201
He looks,

3626
01:37:40,201 --> 01:37:41,390
he looks freak you out.

3627
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,440
He looks phenomenal.

3628
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:43,161
I mean,

3629
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:44,090
he's got his hair.

3630
01:37:44,091 --> 01:37:45,720
His skin is really youthful hair probably.

3631
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:47,280
Did you probably clues from here on?

3632
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:48,560
Maybe there's a lot that's fake

3633
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,020
magic Mike,

3634
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:51,591
but this isn't.

3635
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:52,540
This isn't Makani.

3636
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,243
Watch him

3637
01:37:56,110 --> 01:37:56,943
because I do.

3638
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,020
There's your boy.

3639
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:04,833
He's awesome.

3640
01:38:09,310 --> 01:38:10,800
He's got a great sense of humor to

3641
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:15,903
Mike.

3642
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:19,220
Mike has fans watch him dance.

3643
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:21,503
Doing

3644
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:26,140
that dreamboat guy that never came along.

3645
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:32,923
That's

3646
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:35,040
actually the idea.

3647
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:38,370
Like

3648
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:40,963
how do you know my brother?

3649
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:42,080
I'm an entrepreneur.

3650
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,770
I manage a few business
trying to hit on my system.

3651
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,993
Okay.

3652
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,271
Good.

3653
01:38:46,271 --> 01:38:48,190
Top entrepreneurs.

3654
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:48,620
Super.

3655
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:49,500
Super Entrepreneur.

3656
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:50,663
Either one.

3657
01:38:50,770 --> 01:38:51,603
I was hoping

3658
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:54,670
it was pretty funny.

3659
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,150
I'm just trying to figure out
why women money and a good time.

3660
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:06,860
Just trying to forget about the people
who existed in the [inaudible] right?

3661
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:07,743
Are we fighting?

3662
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:09,400
This is our first place.

3663
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:12,750
Wait,

3664
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:17,120
when is he a stripper with a heart of
gold because I think that's what's going

3665
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:17,954
on here,

3666
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:18,261
man.

3667
01:39:18,261 --> 01:39:18,560
Dude,

3668
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,060
is that much.

3669
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:19,930
Is that channing tatum?

3670
01:39:19,931 --> 01:39:20,764
I was Joe Rogan.

3671
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,653
That was so weird.

3672
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:23,160
I just can't be around your lifestyle.

3673
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,211
Am I magic Mike?

3674
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:25,110
Right now talking to you,

3675
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:29,190
am I imagining this
might be a great season?

3676
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:32,060
Might be roadhouse is
actually an okay movie,

3677
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,903
man.

3678
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,460
You just turned gay.

3679
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:36,630
Then this whole movie did you
just weren't gay or there's.

3680
01:39:36,930 --> 01:39:37,590
There's Matt.

3681
01:39:37,590 --> 01:39:38,420
Let me see.

3682
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:39,253
Are there is.

3683
01:39:39,650 --> 01:39:40,161
Oh my God.

3684
01:39:40,161 --> 01:39:41,210
He doesn't kiss me song.

3685
01:39:41,211 --> 01:39:42,044
Really.

3686
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:45,790
That's it.

3687
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:46,623
I want to see more.

3688
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,660
Uh,

3689
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:49,480
you don't want to know
what I have to do for 20.

3690
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:51,041
Oh,

3691
01:39:51,041 --> 01:39:51,490
I get it.

3692
01:39:51,490 --> 01:39:53,440
You suck a cock show.

3693
01:39:53,441 --> 01:39:55,480
That's what really goes on with this kid.

3694
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:58,190
He's about six [inaudible],

3695
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:01,550
two trapping beast of a man played.

3696
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:02,730
He played college football.

3697
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:03,370
Shrink wrapping.

3698
01:40:03,370 --> 01:40:04,270
Fucking athletes.

3699
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:05,950
Who the fuck?

3700
01:40:05,950 --> 01:40:06,910
Why didn't you watch that?

3701
01:40:06,911 --> 01:40:07,990
I don't know what happened to you.

3702
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:09,323
I was robbed on your

3703
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:11,823
calender.

3704
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:12,960
Mrs. Calender to watch.

3705
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,080
He's.

3706
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,913
He's blaming.

3707
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:15,450
Wow.

3708
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:15,670
Oh,

3709
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:17,380
I might have to get high and watch it,

3710
01:40:17,381 --> 01:40:18,790
but I'll probably get really scared.

3711
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:20,230
I'll probably have to get my blankie.

3712
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:21,280
You get a little jealous.

3713
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,950
You better be inside of a
pussy when you watch it.

3714
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:24,813
Really a time.

3715
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:29,220
I don't have that kind
of stamina or desire for.

3716
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:29,770
Well,

3717
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:32,680
that's why I got tricked early on in life,

3718
01:40:32,681 --> 01:40:34,810
but I figured it out now I'm fine.

3719
01:40:34,811 --> 01:40:36,820
Just beaten off and then
going about my business.

3720
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:39,820
So you got to take one of these pills.

3721
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:39,931
Yeah.

3722
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:40,571
What is this stuff?

3723
01:40:40,571 --> 01:40:41,980
He took a hot rod.

3724
01:40:42,010 --> 01:40:42,843
5,000.

3725
01:40:42,890 --> 01:40:46,570
Throw that shit over here and I
took one last night when I got home.

3726
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:47,261
What's in it?

3727
01:40:47,261 --> 01:40:48,094
I can't read this.

3728
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:50,290
It's something extracted from aunt.

3729
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:51,124
So I guess.

3730
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:52,540
Well I don't know.

3731
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,910
Something aunt's maker.

3732
01:40:54,911 --> 01:40:58,750
You have hard ons and I maybe just don't
know that ants have rock hard boners

3733
01:40:58,751 --> 01:40:59,260
the whole time.

3734
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,190
Look at this label.

3735
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:00,880
Look at this.

3736
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:01,391
What it is.

3737
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:05,140
I guarantee you there's probably
some fucking prescription drugs.

3738
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:06,300
I was going to say just my.

3739
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:09,040
It's marketed towards the gay community.

3740
01:41:09,041 --> 01:41:09,550
I heard that.

3741
01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:10,383
I bet you could give.

3742
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:11,380
I'm not saying it is,

3743
01:41:11,381 --> 01:41:11,641
but if.

3744
01:41:11,641 --> 01:41:12,490
What if it was.

3745
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:16,120
Is it possible that you could
get viagara like bulk Viagra,

3746
01:41:16,121 --> 01:41:19,480
like because they have generic
or whatever it's called,

3747
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,640
would it modafinil or whatever the fuck.

3748
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:25,780
The actual chemicals that the label is
so tiny that you can't even read it.

3749
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:26,980
You can read what the fuck's in there.

3750
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:29,280
There's some kind of
prescription thing in their life

3751
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:36,260
that they definitely found that with a
athletic supplements that there's been a

3752
01:41:36,791 --> 01:41:40,120
lot of athletic tainting where you
take some shit and then actually have

3753
01:41:40,121 --> 01:41:40,954
steroids in it.

3754
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,170
There was some stuff that they
used to sell that's illegal now.

3755
01:41:44,171 --> 01:41:45,400
That essentially is.

3756
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:46,060
Yeah,

3757
01:41:46,060 --> 01:41:49,600
well there was a thing called
Mag 10 that I took and holy shit,

3758
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:52,780
it was unbelievably strong
and you could get it at GNC.

3759
01:41:52,781 --> 01:41:54,940
I was fucking soul strong
when I was taking that stuff.

3760
01:41:54,941 --> 01:41:55,600
It was amazing.

3761
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:58,750
It was just deck animal or something
or I don't know what the fuck it was,

3762
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:01,270
but it was essentially
it was an oral steroid.

3763
01:42:01,320 --> 01:42:06,280
I mean it had an effect of a steroid and
you can get a GNC for a little while.

3764
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,470
These have ghb it at GNC.

3765
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:10,810
I remember seeing that shit.

3766
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:12,400
It was in a fridge refrigerator.

3767
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:13,750
That's Hilarious,

3768
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:14,650
but it was the biggest.

3769
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:16,330
I mean it just wouldn't go away.

3770
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:20,000
Like I would mess up and then just
to be another boner that had been

3771
01:42:20,001 --> 01:42:20,834
masturbating again.

3772
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,750
It was just crazy.

3773
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:26,020
That sounds like it's just as
good as Viagra watching magic.

3774
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:27,023
No,

3775
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:30,790
it was just a coincidence.

3776
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:31,440
I was,

3777
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,920
it was odd that a boner.

3778
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:33,481
Well,

3779
01:42:33,481 --> 01:42:34,090
I mean,

3780
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:35,880
the only thing that
they could be doing is,

3781
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:35,951
uh,

3782
01:42:35,951 --> 01:42:38,980
maybe maybe it has some
nitric oxide effect.

3783
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:39,191
I mean,

3784
01:42:39,191 --> 01:42:40,740
that's the idea behind a.

3785
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:43,840
like those opens up
your m and o two pills.

3786
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,833
Capillaries.

3787
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:46,690
He said that gave him crazy boners.

3788
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:49,750
It gives you a bonus that has
a very viagra like effect.

3789
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,330
What's that?

3790
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:50,751
Those,

3791
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:52,990
a nitric oxide drinks.

3792
01:42:52,991 --> 01:42:53,201
You know,

3793
01:42:53,201 --> 01:42:55,380
those drinks like eno to explode and shit,

3794
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:57,610
which might be illegal now explode.

3795
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:00,040
Yeah.

3796
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,650
Maybe that's it loads.

3797
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:05,170
There was some other stuff
called Jack Three Day.

3798
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:06,520
One of those is off the market now.

3799
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:06,911
One of them,

3800
01:43:06,911 --> 01:43:09,150
they yanked jacked

3801
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:11,471
dude.

3802
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:14,500
I used to take that stuff before I
lifted and I just fucking just start

3803
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:15,101
sweating.

3804
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:17,410
Like immediately your heart's pounding,

3805
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,840
sweating or I'm waiting for them to.

3806
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:20,201
I want to.

3807
01:43:20,201 --> 01:43:22,120
I want them to block
the Myostatin my fuck.

3808
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:23,200
You don't want to do that,

3809
01:43:23,201 --> 01:43:23,411
man.

3810
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:23,670
You,

3811
01:43:23,670 --> 01:43:26,590
you'll look like that artificial
you that they used for your,

3812
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:26,860
uh,

3813
01:43:26,860 --> 01:43:29,230
your ad for special.

3814
01:43:29,440 --> 01:43:33,880
You holding the mic up my arms and
they looked like dean listers be bigger

3815
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,120
because more stupid because they're like,

3816
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:37,954
we can't look.

3817
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:38,741
It doesn't make any sense.

3818
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:39,420
Look at your head.

3819
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:42,610
Exactly how the framework
for this narrow head.

3820
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:46,060
It's weird when you see people that have
like big parts of their bodies and then

3821
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,170
everything else was normal.

3822
01:43:47,880 --> 01:43:49,210
Brennan shops a little bit like that.

3823
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:50,440
Like Brendan's got a small,

3824
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:51,080
like,

3825
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,170
like he's got a headline

3826
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:55,970
for that fits on me and he's 65 to
50 and I was looking at his head.

3827
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:56,121
I go,

3828
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:56,331
dude,

3829
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:57,164
you have a fucking.

3830
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,390
His hands and his head are not very big.

3831
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:00,313
What did he say?

3832
01:44:00,820 --> 01:44:01,011
He,

3833
01:44:01,011 --> 01:44:01,401
yeah,

3834
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:01,821
he was like,

3835
01:44:01,821 --> 01:44:02,031
yeah,

3836
01:44:02,031 --> 01:44:02,271
I know.

3837
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:03,980
I've got a small fucking
head and I got to smile.

3838
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:04,640
I've got small hands.

3839
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,240
I was like,

3840
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:07,040
because the rest of his body is retarded.

3841
01:44:07,041 --> 01:44:08,750
Like he's so fucking strong.

3842
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,840
It's weird when people
get looked at the worst,

3843
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:14,070
the biggest head when you have
a big head and a little bond.

3844
01:44:14,071 --> 01:44:14,904
He said the worst.

3845
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:16,240
A lot of starters.

3846
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,400
A lot of stars have that
big of little bottles.

3847
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:18,690
Yeah.

3848
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:19,760
Mick Jagger and shit.

3849
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:20,020
Yeah.

3850
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:20,853
He had a big,

3851
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:21,883
huge head,

3852
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,070
giant head.

3853
01:44:23,070 --> 01:44:24,130
He's 130 pounds,

3854
01:44:24,131 --> 01:44:25,160
but your head keeps growing.

3855
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:26,690
Keeps growing,

3856
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:27,201
keeps growing.

3857
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:30,170
That's the weirdest thing that you see
old people when they have gigantic ears.

3858
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,250
It was like,

3859
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:31,791
Whoa,

3860
01:44:31,791 --> 01:44:33,020
what is going on with your ears?

3861
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:38,021
Man knows a large nose though for some
reason is not as disturbing because some

3862
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:39,620
people like from the get go,

3863
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:40,540
they have a large nose.

3864
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:40,941
It's just to.

3865
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:41,211
No,

3866
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:43,220
it's a masculine trait to the ears though.

3867
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:43,700
It's like,

3868
01:44:43,700 --> 01:44:45,260
what is happening to your ears?

3869
01:44:45,740 --> 01:44:46,460
Can you.

3870
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,900
Can you stop those with your guards?

3871
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,040
Because that shit is worse.

3872
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:50,110
Can you bind your ears?

3873
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:52,760
What if you're an old
dude with cauliflower ear?

3874
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:53,410
I mean,

3875
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,950
it looks like a Jean labelle.

3876
01:44:54,980 --> 01:44:55,620
He ever seen.

3877
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:57,680
Both sides are so big at the sun.

3878
01:44:57,681 --> 01:44:58,461
Never hits his face.

3879
01:44:58,461 --> 01:44:59,031
I was like,

3880
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:00,320
what the fuck is with those ears?

3881
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:01,780
He's got a giant.

3882
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:02,810
He's got a giant head.

3883
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:03,644
He's 80.

3884
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:04,610
He's an older gentleman.

3885
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:06,980
I wouldn't want him to get me
in a fucking double risk law.

3886
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:08,210
Yeah,

3887
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:09,050
we had 80.

3888
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:10,040
He'll break your fucking.

3889
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:13,420
There was a story with some kids breaking
into a car in this neighborhood just

3890
01:45:13,610 --> 01:45:18,290
fucking 10 years ago or whatever when
he's 70 years old and he went out to stop

3891
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:19,460
them and they gave him a hard time.

3892
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:20,061
We put one of them,

3893
01:45:20,061 --> 01:45:20,540
the sleep,

3894
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:21,770
the other one who flips on his head.

3895
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:25,341
He's no joke,

3896
01:45:25,341 --> 01:45:25,750
dude.

3897
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:28,610
Now certain old men who
can't fuck with man.

3898
01:45:28,611 --> 01:45:30,550
I didn't fuck with him when
he was young and he was.

3899
01:45:30,600 --> 01:45:32,360
He was a stunt guy on my on death valley,

3900
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:33,990
the TV show I did and I'm sitting in,

3901
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:35,090
I'm in the makeup chair.

3902
01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:39,110
I'm pontificating about fighting
like I liked fucking makeup,

3903
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:40,130
chipping the belt in Jujitsu.

3904
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:41,023
I'm talking about.

3905
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:41,450
I got.

3906
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:45,170
Well the guy that's going to beat him
in this UFC fight and I'm like going on

3907
01:45:45,171 --> 01:45:47,420
and on and basically Joe Rogan
lightened the fucking trailer.

3908
01:45:47,421 --> 01:45:47,631
Right.

3909
01:45:47,631 --> 01:45:51,160
But I don't know as much and I'm
like fucking being a fucking you.

3910
01:45:51,210 --> 01:45:54,020
If you'd heard me talk a little bit like
this is going to fight in the octagon,

3911
01:45:54,021 --> 01:45:54,500
you know,

3912
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,670
little knowledge goes a long way.

3913
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:56,481
Fucking gene.

3914
01:45:56,481 --> 01:45:57,530
The bell starts piping in,

3915
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,230
but he's got Zombie makeup on and I go,

3916
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:01,860
you seem to know fighting
a little bit and,

3917
01:46:01,861 --> 01:46:04,090
and the mangoes says Sheila Bell,

3918
01:46:04,091 --> 01:46:04,520
Bro.

3919
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,353
And I go,

3920
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:06,170
Holy Shit,

3921
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:06,750
Mr Bell.

3922
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,750
So sorry I haven't talked
about fighting this whole time.

3923
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:09,531
And I spent,

3924
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:11,550
I was glued to his side for three days,

3925
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:12,403
a little puppy.

3926
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:16,070
Puppy dog asked him questions
and everything and he's a
sweetheart of a guy too.

3927
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,060
He judges does a lot of judging here.

3928
01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:22,580
You see him at a MMA events and
he's always with Ronda Rousey,

3929
01:46:23,070 --> 01:46:23,903
you know,

3930
01:46:24,310 --> 01:46:24,980
he's a.

3931
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:28,580
He worked a lot of those guys that
she worked out with him or something.

3932
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:28,730
Well,

3933
01:46:28,730 --> 01:46:29,563
he worked with,

3934
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:30,470
I'm sure the sheer.

3935
01:46:30,471 --> 01:46:32,510
He's done some work with her.

3936
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,400
He's worked with a lot of those.

3937
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:37,040
The Armenian dudes go cars guys.

3938
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,620
Like there's what?

3939
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:40,290
A group of fucking animals are they?

3940
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:41,060
Oh yeah.

3941
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:43,770
Car Row strong shit.

3942
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,873
Cairo Cairo's.

3943
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:45,460
Ridiculous.

3944
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:46,100
Strong.

3945
01:46:46,100 --> 01:46:47,300
Karl Pribram was back when,

3946
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:50,060
I think it was a blue belt or a
purple belt and just ragdolled

3947
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:50,730
me.

3948
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:51,031
Really?

3949
01:46:51,031 --> 01:46:51,251
Yeah.

3950
01:46:51,251 --> 01:46:51,391
Yeah.

3951
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:52,200
He throwed me around.

3952
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:53,220
He throwed me around.

3953
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:54,660
He's strongly shit.

3954
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:54,911
Well,

3955
01:46:54,911 --> 01:46:55,290
you know,

3956
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:56,190
Caro beat,

3957
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:59,130
so could you in a fucking
judo match when he was a kid,

3958
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,031
so could you.

3959
01:47:00,031 --> 01:47:01,680
Is so much bigger than Carl.

3960
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,670
And they had an open way.

3961
01:47:02,671 --> 01:47:03,960
Judo match and Carl beat up.

3962
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,771
That's weird.

3963
01:47:04,771 --> 01:47:05,580
Strong that way.

3964
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,530
Carl was a super talented a judo too.

3965
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,660
He had a real bad injury though
when he was training for the Matt.

3966
01:47:09,661 --> 01:47:10,220
He fine,

3967
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:10,650
you know,

3968
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:11,483
Carl was a.

3969
01:47:11,850 --> 01:47:12,683
had a bunch of.

3970
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:15,540
He's another dude that had not budget
per prescription pill problems.

3971
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:20,541
And what happened was he tore his leg
when he was training for a title shot back

3972
01:47:20,761 --> 01:47:23,400
when Matt Hughes was
champion and he tore it bad.

3973
01:47:23,580 --> 01:47:25,020
He flexes it when he flexes it.

3974
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:26,250
Now it looks like a shark.

3975
01:47:26,251 --> 01:47:28,650
Took a bite out of his leg
and I'm not exaggerating,

3976
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:30,600
his hamstring just disappeared.

3977
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,291
Exploded.

3978
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:32,790
And he never got it surgically repaired.

3979
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:37,250
So he's got this big concave area and
his leg and it took most of the power out

3980
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:39,840
of his leg and he got him on pain pills.

3981
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:41,770
So I that,

3982
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,860
that guy health insurance.

3983
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:44,871
Well,

3984
01:47:44,871 --> 01:47:47,640
I mean I don't know what
it was and I'm sure that's.

3985
01:47:47,870 --> 01:47:48,320
Yeah,

3986
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:51,250
I'm sure he didn't have health insurance
or maybe tried to like rehab it.

3987
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:52,890
I'm pretty sure he didn't have insurance.

3988
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:53,800
So you know,

3989
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,710
now I don't know if there's
anything they can do about it.

3990
01:47:55,711 --> 01:47:59,160
I think once the muscle like
slides back and rolls up,

3991
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,230
I think it's really hard to reattach it.

3992
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,720
I think they have to do
it right after the injury.

3993
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:05,130
I know that's the case with biceps.

3994
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,211
Like a lot of dudes,

3995
01:48:06,211 --> 01:48:09,690
they blow their bicep out and then they
have like no bicep if you seen that

3996
01:48:09,691 --> 01:48:10,070
before.

3997
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,560
Yes.

3998
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:14,010
A lot of fighters have that where it
curls up and it's like the top of their

3999
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:17,310
bicep was like a little knot and
then below it there's nothing left.

4000
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,031
Yeah,

4001
01:48:18,031 --> 01:48:19,280
that's what it's like with his leg.

4002
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:21,300
So it kind of fucked his career up.

4003
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:24,240
You know when you're making
your living off your body.

4004
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:25,860
Well then the other thing about training,

4005
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:26,310
you know,

4006
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:31,310
as you get older and a lot of guys were
training a long time that you want to go

4007
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:33,030
in and blow yourself to bits in the gym.

4008
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:36,180
Actually what happens is
by the time you're 40,

4009
01:48:36,181 --> 01:48:37,310
a lot of times you're,

4010
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:41,220
you're having major problems with your
hips or your knees and stuff like that.

4011
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:45,570
So a huge part of exercise is knowing
when to stop and doing just enough a body.

4012
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:47,820
If you look at people's bodies
like athletes and stuff,

4013
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:49,650
you realize no matter how strong they are,

4014
01:48:49,651 --> 01:48:51,180
we are fucking fragile man.

4015
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:54,180
Bone and cartilage doesn't
really do well under duress.

4016
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:54,991
Yeah,

4017
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:57,750
well there's certain parts
of your body that break,

4018
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:58,130
you know,

4019
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:59,340
there was nothing he could do about it.

4020
01:48:59,341 --> 01:48:59,971
And they hips,

4021
01:48:59,971 --> 01:49:00,271
hips,

4022
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:01,104
ankles,

4023
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:01,440
you know,

4024
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:02,910
certain shit that just breaks down.

4025
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:03,590
Man.

4026
01:49:03,590 --> 01:49:05,130
I see a lot of people with hip surgery.

4027
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:05,401
Man,

4028
01:49:05,401 --> 01:49:05,941
that's scary.

4029
01:49:05,941 --> 01:49:06,840
Fucking shit.

4030
01:49:06,841 --> 01:49:09,330
Hip Surgery Sucks because
when you get a fake hip,

4031
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:10,440
it's good for 10 years.

4032
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:12,050
That's ridiculous.

4033
01:49:12,051 --> 01:49:13,410
And you're not doing sports anymore.

4034
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:14,393
And by the way,

4035
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:17,730
if they come out with some shit
that grows you a better hip joint,

4036
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,240
now you can't do it anymore because
you've hacked your shit off and put an

4037
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:22,230
artificial one in there.

4038
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:22,861
Well,

4039
01:49:22,861 --> 01:49:24,360
they're going to have artificial bones.

4040
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:24,970
Artificial ever.

4041
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:25,110
I mean,

4042
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:27,960
haven't they already replaced
like femurs and stuff or.

4043
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:28,980
I don't know if it was a Femur,

4044
01:49:28,981 --> 01:49:29,810
but I believe they,

4045
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,020
they've replaced part.

4046
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:31,854
Maybe it.

4047
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,770
What's the Big One?

4048
01:49:32,771 --> 01:49:36,550
There's a fibia and that there
are a number of people who have,

4049
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:39,680
who have rebuilt.

4050
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:43,170
Literally they trachea's and bladders.

4051
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:48,190
They take the cartilage from a
cadaver and then they sponsor

4052
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,643
cricket.

4053
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:51,480
Cricket,

4054
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:51,890
cricket.

4055
01:49:51,890 --> 01:49:52,450
Yeah.

4056
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:53,010
That's funny.

4057
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,101
Oh,

4058
01:49:53,101 --> 01:49:53,934
that's hilarious.

4059
01:49:54,170 --> 01:49:55,003
Let me to try find.

4060
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:55,893
I'll try.

4061
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,090
I won't find it.

4062
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:58,331
Bridal tell you.

4063
01:49:58,331 --> 01:49:58,730
Well it was.

4064
01:49:58,730 --> 01:50:00,040
I was in the desert.

4065
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:01,540
As soon as you get up,

4066
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,240
you stopped some real
hamburger and let it go rank.

4067
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:05,643
Um,

4068
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:06,993
but uh,

4069
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:07,953
what was I talking about?

4070
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:08,910
Something really important.

4071
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:11,350
What were you talking about?

4072
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:14,140
Like it now you're looking
for it and it shot 20 cricket

4073
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:17,913
injuries.

4074
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,830
The body they take,

4075
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:23,170
they took a trachea as women had a tricky.

4076
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:24,910
I had to be removed
because of tuberculosis,

4077
01:50:24,911 --> 01:50:28,000
and then they took a trachea from a
cadaver and they sprayed it with her stem

4078
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:32,050
cells and she grew a trachea
and now she has it in her body.

4079
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,041
What happens is,

4080
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:37,180
I believe that the cartilage then is
taken over by the stem cells and they grow

4081
01:50:37,181 --> 01:50:37,750
their own cartilage.

4082
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:38,090
So yeah,

4083
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,360
she grew her own tracheas.

4084
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,120
That's incredible.

4085
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:42,370
And they did the same
thing with the bladders.

4086
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:42,781
Well,

4087
01:50:42,781 --> 01:50:43,021
you know,

4088
01:50:43,021 --> 01:50:43,854
when you grow,

4089
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,700
when you have an acl surgery
and you use a cadaver acl graft,

4090
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,240
it basically just acts
as a scaffold and right.

4091
01:50:50,490 --> 01:50:52,960
And then your body
develops to build over it,

4092
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:54,690
a real acl over it.

4093
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,620
So as you do your rehab
and your exercises,

4094
01:50:57,630 --> 01:50:59,770
your body is assimilating that,

4095
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,370
that tissue and taking over with its own.

4096
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:03,120
Right.

4097
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:03,721
So in the first,

4098
01:51:03,721 --> 01:51:04,111
you know,

4099
01:51:04,111 --> 01:51:05,130
in the beginning it's just like,

4100
01:51:05,131 --> 01:51:07,270
it's not really wanting to
grow new scaffolding stuff,

4101
01:51:07,280 --> 01:51:09,940
new fucking legs for people
that lose their fucking land.

4102
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:11,490
People think that it was replaced.

4103
01:51:11,491 --> 01:51:11,791
They think,

4104
01:51:11,791 --> 01:51:11,911
well,

4105
01:51:11,911 --> 01:51:13,410
now I got this new ligament,

4106
01:51:13,411 --> 01:51:14,430
it's in place.

4107
01:51:14,670 --> 01:51:15,370
And uh,

4108
01:51:15,370 --> 01:51:15,630
you know,

4109
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:16,860
I just got to strengthen it like,

4110
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:17,091
no,

4111
01:51:17,091 --> 01:51:17,280
no,

4112
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:17,451
no,

4113
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:17,671
no.

4114
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:18,091
It's like,

4115
01:51:18,091 --> 01:51:18,811
it's got to grow.

4116
01:51:18,811 --> 01:51:21,680
There will have to talk about his acl,

4117
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:21,990
you know,

4118
01:51:21,990 --> 01:51:22,310
you,

4119
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:23,520
you feel 100 percent.

4120
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:23,910
But the,

4121
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:24,840
he didn't do it that way.

4122
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:25,860
He did a different thing.

4123
01:51:26,160 --> 01:51:27,120
He did a different thing.

4124
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:31,800
He did what's called a Patella tendon
graft and that I did on my left leg.

4125
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:32,873
And what that is,

4126
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:34,770
you know that tendon in
the front of your knee,

4127
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:36,570
and this is one of the
arguments for doing this.

4128
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,700
The tenant in front of
your knee is really big.

4129
01:51:38,701 --> 01:51:39,331
It's really fat.

4130
01:51:39,331 --> 01:51:40,111
You don't need all of it.

4131
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:44,040
So they take like a third of it and
they have a piece of bone from your Shin

4132
01:51:44,041 --> 01:51:47,370
where it attaches and a piece of bone
from your knee cap where it attaches

4133
01:51:47,371 --> 01:51:47,820
there.

4134
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:52,380
And then they open you up like a fish
and then they screw it into the bottom of

4135
01:51:52,381 --> 01:51:53,214
your leg.

4136
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,620
They screwed into the top,

4137
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:57,383
scrolling,

4138
01:51:57,690 --> 01:52:00,480
scrolling through the bone into your.

4139
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:04,950
They drill a hole in your leg and
then they screw the bone into place.

4140
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:08,640
I have screws in the bottom of my knee
and in the top of my knee and the left

4141
01:52:08,641 --> 01:52:10,710
side that show up and x rays to amazing.

4142
01:52:10,920 --> 01:52:11,280
Yeah.

4143
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,840
And then it's just a matter of getting
circulation to that tissue and letting

4144
01:52:15,841 --> 01:52:16,860
that tissue heal up.

4145
01:52:16,861 --> 01:52:17,780
And he was talking about,

4146
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:21,180
he said he had to wait for a
circulation of capital or is it,

4147
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,680
it's a use a long process.

4148
01:52:22,681 --> 01:52:26,400
And you also have to make sure that
during that process you don't reinjury

4149
01:52:26,401 --> 01:52:28,740
yourself because you still
essentially have no acl on that side.

4150
01:52:28,741 --> 01:52:30,360
This is wobbly piece of flesh.

4151
01:52:30,650 --> 01:52:32,460
When was the last time he fought George?

4152
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:33,294
It's been awhile.

4153
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:33,661
He,

4154
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:34,080
uh,

4155
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:36,390
he injured his leg at
least nine months ago.

4156
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:36,960
And uh,

4157
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:37,260
you know,

4158
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:37,590
he's,

4159
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:39,380
he's ready for November and

4160
01:52:40,890 --> 01:52:41,723
know

4161
01:52:42,710 --> 01:52:45,530
a performance enhancing drug.

4162
01:52:45,531 --> 01:52:47,090
I know it's an important test.

4163
01:52:47,091 --> 01:52:48,290
Positive for weed man.

4164
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:49,830
He tested po man.

4165
01:52:50,270 --> 01:52:51,081
He didn't listen,

4166
01:52:51,081 --> 01:52:51,914
man.

4167
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:54,500
Fucking Po,

4168
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:56,270
Po is on his ass.

4169
01:52:56,930 --> 01:53:00,020
He tested positive for
a marijuana metabolite,

4170
01:53:00,021 --> 01:53:01,580
which is non psychoactive.

4171
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:04,100
So what he had in his system,

4172
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:06,440
like say if he only took
this marijuana metabolite,

4173
01:53:06,441 --> 01:53:07,640
like took it into pill form,

4174
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,170
it wouldn't do anything.

4175
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:09,920
It does.

4176
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,870
It literally is non psychoactive.

4177
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:12,800
You can't get high from it.

4178
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:16,510
So the idea of marijuana as a
performance enhancing drug with this non

4179
01:53:16,511 --> 01:53:19,160
psychoactive trace
element inside your body,

4180
01:53:19,161 --> 01:53:20,630
it's just silly because he wasn't in.

4181
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:24,230
It's one thing is if he
tested that he was tested,

4182
01:53:24,231 --> 01:53:25,670
that he was high when he was fighting.

4183
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:26,181
Okay.

4184
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:26,871
And by the way,

4185
01:53:26,871 --> 01:53:28,880
that has happened when he fought Gomi,

4186
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:29,901
they did a test.

4187
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:31,780
I don't know if he was actually
high when he fought gummy,

4188
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:33,710
but he probably got
high of the day before.

4189
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:35,360
Amazing.

4190
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:36,193
Fucking great.

4191
01:53:36,980 --> 01:53:39,550
That was a great fight to
going in that Gogo blog.

4192
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:40,160
Oh,

4193
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,030
that was so sweet.

4194
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:42,351
He was like,

4195
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,000
he's so calm under fire,

4196
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:44,470
man.

4197
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:44,940
He,

4198
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:47,490
he sets that shit up and slapped it on me.

4199
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,960
That was a.

4200
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:48,561
That was a big,

4201
01:53:48,561 --> 01:53:49,240
big victory.

4202
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:50,420
That was some anger.

4203
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:51,650
But that controlled anger,

4204
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:53,570
like somehow he can keep it.

4205
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:54,890
The thing is about is pace.

4206
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:57,290
Nick Diaz has this crazy
pace that he can keep going,

4207
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:00,440
so other dudes like as you were
in this wild dog fight with him,

4208
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:02,720
they were out and he just keeps going.

4209
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,450
Well that's kind of
why I'd like to see it.

4210
01:54:04,451 --> 01:54:07,400
Cain Valasquez fight fucking John Jones.

4211
01:54:07,490 --> 01:54:07,701
Well,

4212
01:54:07,701 --> 01:54:08,570
Keynes gonna Fight Junior.

4213
01:54:08,571 --> 01:54:09,404
Dos Santos.

4214
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,693
That's the next one.

4215
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:11,660
Start the first time,

4216
01:54:11,661 --> 01:54:11,960
right?

4217
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:12,201
Yes,

4218
01:54:12,201 --> 01:54:12,531
he did.

4219
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:14,260
They're fighting in July.

4220
01:54:15,570 --> 01:54:16,580
The better boxer.

4221
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:17,590
Well,

4222
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:21,080
well I dunno when Jr Kratos
and it's just what it is.

4223
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:22,760
I mean they said that
junior had a knee injury.

4224
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:24,200
Cane definitely had a knee injury.

4225
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:28,670
They fall on Fox and know cain stood
up with them a little bit too long and

4226
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:30,560
junior just winged the bomb.

4227
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:34,040
Adam and caught him right in the
town wearing gloves and those guys.

4228
01:54:34,041 --> 01:54:35,570
When you guys guys who hit that hard,

4229
01:54:35,610 --> 01:54:37,010
I don't care what your head looks like.

4230
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:37,873
You're going out.

4231
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:38,211
Yeah.

4232
01:54:38,211 --> 01:54:38,840
Well Junior,

4233
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,160
junior punches fucking hard.

4234
01:54:40,210 --> 01:54:40,430
You know,

4235
01:54:40,430 --> 01:54:42,800
he punches hard and he swung that one.

4236
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:43,701
They're fighting again.

4237
01:54:43,701 --> 01:54:47,360
January the January first weekend.

4238
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,590
I think it's December 29th.

4239
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:50,360
The big event in Vegas.

4240
01:54:50,361 --> 01:54:51,380
It should be fucking crazy.

4241
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:54,530
And that's the rematch because
everybody thought before that fight,

4242
01:54:54,531 --> 01:54:56,120
the junior dos Santos was going to be,

4243
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,130
you know,

4244
01:54:57,130 --> 01:54:58,400
a top fighter,

4245
01:54:58,620 --> 01:54:59,020
you know,

4246
01:54:59,020 --> 01:54:59,140
they,

4247
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:02,240
they definitely thought that he
had a chance of winning that fight.

4248
01:55:02,241 --> 01:55:03,740
But king was the favorite,

4249
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:04,190
you know,

4250
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:06,840
Cain was the guy that everybody felt
like after he destroyed brock Lesnar,

4251
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,320
every Goddamn Cain Velasquez
might be the best ever.

4252
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:11,150
What a fucking heavyweight destroyer.

4253
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:15,530
But junior just changed the whole course
of the heavyweight title picture with

4254
01:55:15,531 --> 01:55:16,364
one punch,

4255
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:16,881
you know.

4256
01:55:16,881 --> 01:55:19,340
And now everybody's scared of junior.

4257
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:20,690
He's so hard to take down.

4258
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:21,860
He's so hard to take down.

4259
01:55:21,861 --> 01:55:22,880
His hands are so good.

4260
01:55:22,970 --> 01:55:23,301
Didn't he?

4261
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:23,511
Didn't,

4262
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:23,631
he?

4263
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:23,990
Uh,

4264
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:26,390
he took care of a Carl and as well,

4265
01:55:26,391 --> 01:55:26,720
right?

4266
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:28,400
It'd beat the fuck other Shankar one man.

4267
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:32,960
Shane when took that fight to coming off
of injuries chain has had a succession

4268
01:55:32,961 --> 01:55:33,794
of injuries,

4269
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,900
mostly related to electrical engineer.

4270
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:38,240
Super Nice Guy.

4271
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,690
Super Smart Couples.

4272
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:40,430
SMART,

4273
01:55:40,430 --> 01:55:41,180
great guy.

4274
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:42,730
He's strong,

4275
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:44,100
strong.

4276
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,660
He picked me up in a bear hug and
started squeezing me and Andy and I.

4277
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:48,543
and I was like,

4278
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:49,770
because I always fuck with them,

4279
01:55:49,771 --> 01:55:50,341
I'm grabbing them.

4280
01:55:50,341 --> 01:55:50,630
I'm like,

4281
01:55:50,630 --> 01:55:51,051
I'll fucking,

4282
01:55:51,051 --> 01:55:52,780
I'm dragging and pepper
your ribs or whatever.

4283
01:55:53,480 --> 01:55:53,890
I'm always,

4284
01:55:53,890 --> 01:55:54,770
he's such a giant.

4285
01:55:54,780 --> 01:55:55,680
We tried to arm wrestle.

4286
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:56,490
He picks me up,

4287
01:55:56,490 --> 01:56:00,240
he starts squeezing me and I started
immediately tapping and he goes,

4288
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:02,220
that's 40 percent bro.

4289
01:56:02,730 --> 01:56:04,560
And I look at nate markers right there.

4290
01:56:04,561 --> 01:56:05,190
And I go,

4291
01:56:05,190 --> 01:56:06,150
could he do that to you?

4292
01:56:06,151 --> 01:56:06,750
And it goes,

4293
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,501
if I let him,

4294
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:07,771
yes.

4295
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:08,604
He goes,

4296
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:08,971
yeah,

4297
01:56:08,971 --> 01:56:09,840
he's a spooky dude.

4298
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:10,980
He's got some serious strength.

4299
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:15,330
He had a long series of injuries
that he got from football.

4300
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:16,400
Quite a few.

4301
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,990
And he's had some surgeries to sort
of clear up some of the issues,

4302
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:21,270
but when that stuff
starts fucking with you,

4303
01:56:21,271 --> 01:56:21,630
man,

4304
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:21,870
you know,

4305
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:23,460
especially back in nerve issues.

4306
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:24,293
He's had a lot of that.

4307
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,950
That yeah.

4308
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,880
Well I think he's probably smart
to keep that full time job,

4309
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:30,150
you know?

4310
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,910
I mean he likes working
till he says it separates.

4311
01:56:32,911 --> 01:56:37,110
His family likes work and he says it's
the work sort of separates him from the

4312
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:40,470
gym time and let them to completely
relax and get into his work.

4313
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:42,780
And he allows him not to dwell on it,

4314
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:45,660
like some fighters just have
the whole data themselves.

4315
01:56:45,661 --> 01:56:47,070
You said he's got such
a good sense of humor.

4316
01:56:47,071 --> 01:56:52,071
I did little guest spot on on the ultimate
fighter and I came in at one point I

4317
01:56:52,291 --> 01:56:52,380
had,

4318
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:53,131
when I first met him,

4319
01:56:53,131 --> 01:56:53,341
I go,

4320
01:56:53,341 --> 01:56:53,731
fuck.

4321
01:56:53,731 --> 01:56:54,210
I go,

4322
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:55,050
I don't know what I do.

4323
01:56:55,080 --> 01:56:58,350
Like what would I do with you if
you were my roommate in prison?

4324
01:56:58,351 --> 01:56:59,070
Like what would I.

4325
01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:00,120
What would I do against you?

4326
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:00,900
And he goes,

4327
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:03,850
you'd suck my cock with those eyes.

4328
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,010
He just did nothing blinking.

4329
01:57:05,011 --> 01:57:05,844
He just looked at him.

4330
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:07,230
You'd suck my cock.

4331
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:07,951
I was like,

4332
01:57:07,951 --> 01:57:08,784
Jesus Christ.

4333
01:57:08,830 --> 01:57:09,050
Yes.

4334
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:10,710
I was trying to talk him out of it.

4335
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:12,600
I'd have to figure out a
way to make a six foot one,

4336
01:57:12,601 --> 01:57:14,370
285 pound fighter my tight.

4337
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,390
Just talk them out of it.

4338
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,130
Yeah,

4339
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:18,120
just sucking cock.

4340
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:19,260
How bad your breath smells.

4341
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:20,103
Exactly.

4342
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:21,030
Yeah.

4343
01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:25,200
What if you just took a pool in your
hand and rubbed it all over your mouth?

4344
01:57:25,250 --> 01:57:26,060
Still want some of this?

4345
01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:26,640
What I would do,

4346
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,473
bitch,

4347
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,231
you want me to suck you?

4348
01:57:28,231 --> 01:57:30,100
Would you rather eat or suck her?

4349
01:57:30,140 --> 01:57:31,050
Suck Shane Collins.

4350
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:31,580
Dick.

4351
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:31,860
Well,

4352
01:57:31,860 --> 01:57:33,240
you probably use the celebrity.

4353
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:34,890
Probably healthier to suck his dick.

4354
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,430
Think of like eating
poo is really dangerous,

4355
01:57:37,431 --> 01:57:38,760
but hepatitis from one and just,

4356
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:38,910
you know,

4357
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:39,451
a Shitty,

4358
01:57:39,451 --> 01:57:40,880
shitty self esteem from the O'brian.

4359
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,030
We're going to have to hire someone
to kill that fucking crooked.

4360
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:44,550
I'll just bring my cat over here.

4361
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:46,560
You calves not good
enough with that cricket.

4362
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:47,550
The cricket is a gangster.

4363
01:57:47,551 --> 01:57:48,750
He's a Pasadena cricket.

4364
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:52,190
Don't make fake noises to fuck.

4365
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:55,830
She make you feel like you
guys are camping again?

4366
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:56,701
No.

4367
01:57:56,701 --> 01:57:58,950
There was no bugs too cold for bugs,

4368
01:57:58,951 --> 01:57:59,430
man.

4369
01:57:59,430 --> 01:57:59,641
Yeah.

4370
01:57:59,641 --> 01:58:00,720
There was no bugs at all.

4371
01:58:00,721 --> 01:58:01,910
We were out in the middle of nowhere.

4372
01:58:01,911 --> 01:58:02,491
We go to.

4373
01:58:02,491 --> 01:58:03,080
I was thinking about this.

4374
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:07,170
If we go in August to
Alaska and hunted Caribou.

4375
01:58:07,680 --> 01:58:09,000
What about grizzly bears?

4376
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:10,740
I don't find possibility.

4377
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:11,670
They encountered,

4378
01:58:11,690 --> 01:58:11,850
um,

4379
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:12,361
this last.

4380
01:58:12,361 --> 01:58:13,650
They went hunting with Tim Ferris,

4381
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,320
who by the way was
returning to the podcast,

4382
01:58:16,321 --> 01:58:20,100
I believe on the 18th
powerful Tim Ferriss podcast.

4383
01:58:20,130 --> 01:58:21,600
He's not available.

4384
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:22,530
He's doing mine though.

4385
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:23,364
And the 18th.

4386
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:24,323
Sorry.

4387
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:24,901
Sorry.

4388
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:26,650
It's only about Brian's
going to bring it back.

4389
01:58:27,410 --> 01:58:28,243
Get

4390
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:30,460
back in.

4391
01:58:30,460 --> 01:58:30,931
Your Day.

4392
01:58:30,931 --> 01:58:32,190
Went in August.

4393
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:33,330
They when a Caribou hunting,

4394
01:58:33,331 --> 01:58:35,010
he went with Rinella
and they shot a Caribou,

4395
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:39,090
but apparently they had a chase grizzly
bears out of camp because the care.

4396
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:39,390
Yeah,

4397
01:58:39,390 --> 01:58:41,100
because what was
happening was the Caribou,

4398
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:41,651
they,

4399
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:43,870
you find them when they
run in these big herds.

4400
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:44,171
Okay.

4401
01:58:44,171 --> 01:58:45,520
You go out and stock when you find them.

4402
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:45,761
Well,

4403
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:50,320
there's camp grounds and some of the
Caribou had gone through the places where

4404
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:51,154
people were camping.

4405
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:56,290
So the folks that were there before them
had shot Caribou in that camp grounds

4406
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:59,500
in the campground smelled
like butchered flesh.

4407
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:00,040
Fuck.

4408
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,330
They had gut piles.

4409
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:03,610
They had animals hanging from me.

4410
01:59:03,611 --> 01:59:05,380
So when they got there that night,

4411
01:59:05,410 --> 01:59:06,640
the grizzly bears came.

4412
01:59:06,910 --> 01:59:07,990
So they had a scare him off.

4413
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:09,340
They had a run at them and shoot at him.

4414
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:10,383
Jesus.

4415
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:11,380
Yes.

4416
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,011
I don't like that.

4417
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:13,060
I don't like that.

4418
01:59:13,090 --> 01:59:15,040
That's one of the first
things that I talked about.

4419
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:18,100
Dog Fuck that before we were so
apprehensive about this trip,

4420
01:59:18,130 --> 01:59:20,600
both Brian and I were both like
fucking what about bears duty?

4421
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:21,221
Worried about bears?

4422
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:21,760
Yes,

4423
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:22,271
I called him up,

4424
01:59:22,271 --> 01:59:22,461
he was,

4425
01:59:22,461 --> 01:59:26,110
I was just fucking thinking about bears
because as it got down to like the last

4426
01:59:26,111 --> 01:59:27,490
couple of weeks we were like,

4427
01:59:27,491 --> 01:59:30,010
we're really going to go camping with
these crazy animals and the middle of

4428
01:59:30,011 --> 01:59:30,500
nowhere.

4429
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,333
No,

4430
01:59:34,020 --> 01:59:36,130
you're in a tent and you
can't protect yourself.

4431
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:37,030
You can't see a common.

4432
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:38,890
Especially for the first
night was freezing rain.

4433
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,300
The first night was 35 degrees
outside and we were sleeping in.

4434
01:59:42,301 --> 01:59:47,301
It's pouring rain and twelfth grades
on that boat on a canoe for four hours.

4435
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:49,661
I had,

4436
01:59:49,661 --> 01:59:51,310
I was literally wearing a sleeping bag.

4437
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:52,150
I was fucking cold.

4438
01:59:52,330 --> 01:59:53,200
It was cold as shit.

4439
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,030
But uh,

4440
01:59:54,030 --> 01:59:54,280
I,

4441
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,690
I'll use it as an exercise.

4442
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:57,280
The rowing part,

4443
01:59:57,281 --> 01:59:59,920
I just rode as hard as I
could use it as a workout.

4444
01:59:59,921 --> 02:00:00,731
And then the hiking,

4445
02:00:00,731 --> 02:00:01,470
I just thought of,

4446
02:00:01,470 --> 02:00:01,870
you know,

4447
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:05,200
control my breathing and use
the hiking is just moving up.

4448
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:07,210
There's no promise promise
when you weren't moving,

4449
02:00:07,211 --> 02:00:07,720
you know,

4450
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:11,410
I almost did a workout
the day before we left.

4451
02:00:11,530 --> 02:00:12,850
I was sitting around the house.

4452
02:00:12,851 --> 02:00:13,800
I was packing up all my shit.

4453
02:00:13,801 --> 02:00:14,021
I was like,

4454
02:00:14,021 --> 02:00:17,290
maybe I should just go lift to do a
crazy kettlebell workout or something.

4455
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:18,191
If I did that,

4456
02:00:18,191 --> 02:00:19,660
I would have been so fucked.

4457
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:22,440
I had no idea it was going to
be so physically demanding.

4458
02:00:23,320 --> 02:00:24,010
Those guys have.

4459
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:27,970
You have to be in serious shit canoeing
and then you're hiking and you got to

4460
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:29,930
pack on your back of pack
in that meat out pack,

4461
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:32,160
net 45 pounds of meat or whatever it was.

4462
02:00:32,350 --> 02:00:34,300
That was not easy and we
only had to walk a mile.

4463
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:36,670
He talked about an elk that
they shot where they had.

4464
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,740
They got up for four days in a row.

4465
02:00:38,890 --> 02:00:43,890
They got up before it was light and they
got back when it was dark out and all

4466
02:00:44,681 --> 02:00:48,130
they did was caught and
pack this fucking animal.

4467
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:48,910
Bring.

4468
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:52,900
It was so bad that you were looking for
nine miles out of yourself or something.

4469
02:00:52,901 --> 02:00:53,140
You know?

4470
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:55,520
They walk nine miles both ways everyday,

4471
02:00:55,570 --> 02:00:59,500
so they walked 18 miles and brought back,

4472
02:00:59,501 --> 02:01:04,501
meet every day over the
hills and craggy bluffs.

4473
02:01:06,041 --> 02:01:06,874
Is that a real thing?

4474
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,013
Sounds good.

4475
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:09,340
Sounds good.

4476
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:10,210
Dry Creek road.

4477
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:15,220
The sre with all sorts of following them
as they went left into the right at the

4478
02:01:17,260 --> 02:01:17,621
show.

4479
02:01:17,621 --> 02:01:18,221
I got his.

4480
02:01:18,221 --> 02:01:18,660
By the way,

4481
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:20,460
when are you gonna you
have to listen to just,

4482
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,460
if you get a chance.

4483
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:22,280
We're posting it.

4484
02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:23,470
I don't know why I'm thinking about this.

4485
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:25,010
Are you advertising when your podcasts?

4486
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:25,450
I swear to God.

4487
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:27,220
I'll shut your fucking life
because you're going like this.

4488
02:01:27,221 --> 02:01:30,580
You're going and you're talking
about for some reason character.

4489
02:01:30,581 --> 02:01:31,750
And he used to do a Mike Tyson.

4490
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:33,493
And uh,

4491
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:33,971
we do.

4492
02:01:33,971 --> 02:01:34,670
Uh,

4493
02:01:34,670 --> 02:01:37,600
we do a little interview with Mike Tyson.

4494
02:01:37,601 --> 02:01:38,620
I'm a 10 minute podcast.

4495
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:39,710
You might want to check it out.

4496
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:42,260
Who you interview
actually interviewed him.

4497
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,370
What'd you catch them?

4498
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:43,971
Don't worry about it.

4499
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:45,010
Just fucking listen to it.

4500
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:45,660
It's only 10 minutes.

4501
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:45,830
Oh,

4502
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:47,300
it's will sasso doing a Mike Tyson.

4503
02:01:47,330 --> 02:01:49,070
I don't do that to me.

4504
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:50,410
You fucking lying to me.

4505
02:01:50,411 --> 02:01:51,440
I looked in your eyes.

4506
02:01:51,441 --> 02:01:52,280
I saw deception.

4507
02:01:52,570 --> 02:01:53,381
I'm not a girl,

4508
02:01:53,381 --> 02:01:53,920
Brian.

4509
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,141
I was like,

4510
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:54,231
oh,

4511
02:01:54,231 --> 02:01:55,330
I can't do this to me.

4512
02:01:56,020 --> 02:01:58,900
Trying to advertise your podcasts
and you figure in the way

4513
02:02:01,450 --> 02:02:03,460
that you really had Mike Tyson,

4514
02:02:03,610 --> 02:02:05,290
but you didn't get son of a bitch.

4515
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:08,380
Fucking impressionists
used to do Mike Tyson.

4516
02:02:08,381 --> 02:02:08,890
Can you do it?

4517
02:02:08,890 --> 02:02:09,723
It's not that good.

4518
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:10,600
It's pretty good.

4519
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:11,770
I'd have to listen to them talk.

4520
02:02:11,870 --> 02:02:12,810
If I listen to him talk,

4521
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:13,663
you could do it.

4522
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:14,130
I can,

4523
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:14,980
I can imitate people.

4524
02:02:14,981 --> 02:02:16,270
Want to hear them talk a bunch of times,

4525
02:02:16,271 --> 02:02:17,340
but I don't practice like,

4526
02:02:17,341 --> 02:02:18,120
I'm not like,

4527
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:19,760
I'm not like a real impressionist.

4528
02:02:19,770 --> 02:02:20,120
Like,

4529
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,240
like they had a.

4530
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,970
and Anthony had was his face.

4531
02:02:22,971 --> 02:02:24,880
So that was talking about earlier.

4532
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:26,570
Uh,

4533
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,490
Kevin Pollack,

4534
02:02:27,490 --> 02:02:28,660
who's brilliant,

4535
02:02:28,780 --> 02:02:30,700
his fucking impressions are ridiculous.

4536
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:32,210
Like have you heard is Christopher Walken?

4537
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:34,720
That thing just popped
and nobody would know.

4538
02:02:35,020 --> 02:02:35,980
I don't know what's going on.

4539
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:37,540
You might have to take this bitch apart.

4540
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:38,100
We've gotten,

4541
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:39,040
got electrical problems.

4542
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:42,430
So the government scanning equipment
interfering with our fucking microphones.

4543
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:44,200
Those sons of bitches,

4544
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:44,801
right?

4545
02:02:44,801 --> 02:02:45,700
Your own Dick Jokes.

4546
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:46,713
Feds.

4547
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,630
Gumshoe strange.

4548
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:51,033
Yeah.

4549
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:53,200
It's funny that we think the government
listening to us when they could just

4550
02:02:53,201 --> 02:02:54,040
download it on the Internet.

4551
02:02:54,041 --> 02:02:54,874
That's how stupid we are.

4552
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:57,500
They're spying on the show like this.

4553
02:02:57,501 --> 02:02:58,334
If the kid just.

4554
02:02:58,610 --> 02:03:01,570
They're getting it before it's on.

4555
02:03:01,571 --> 02:03:03,770
USTREAM is not.

4556
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:06,790
There's not enough fucking
people guys have a computer.

4557
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:08,320
This elections close.

4558
02:03:08,570 --> 02:03:11,980
Is he looking at the fucking
tweets and stuff now?

4559
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,630
It's almost half and half.

4560
02:03:13,690 --> 02:03:14,510
It seems like.

4561
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:14,900
Of course.

4562
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:16,780
That's what makes the fucking.

4563
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:18,430
That's what makes the plot sounds better.

4564
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:20,380
It makes the give it more drama.

4565
02:03:20,460 --> 02:03:22,190
Even while they're both
working for the same people.

4566
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:24,000
Actually there's a lot
more romney than I thought.

4567
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:24,671
Well,

4568
02:03:24,671 --> 02:03:25,510
white people are mad.

4569
02:03:25,680 --> 02:03:26,520
When we were in Montana,

4570
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:28,660
we actually encountered a
douchebag at a restaurant.

4571
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:31,090
There was a like berating us,

4572
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:35,080
you know about Obama as if he
knew we were voting for Obama.

4573
02:03:35,081 --> 02:03:37,120
It wasn't just that he
wanted us to vote for Romney.

4574
02:03:37,121 --> 02:03:38,470
He was going to intimidate us.

4575
02:03:38,850 --> 02:03:41,020
He was such a fucking yogurt.

4576
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:41,410
Yeah.

4577
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:42,243
He was like,

4578
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,870
it was really funny when you go.

4579
02:03:43,950 --> 02:03:45,100
It was a cool little diner.

4580
02:03:45,220 --> 02:03:46,090
It was too bad.

4581
02:03:46,091 --> 02:03:50,590
This guy ruined the experience by being
the owner because the waitress was real

4582
02:03:50,591 --> 02:03:51,190
nice.

4583
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:53,310
The food was great and
we're sitting there.

4584
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:54,580
God put him in his place though.

4585
02:03:54,670 --> 02:03:55,270
Yeah.

4586
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,491
Yeah,

4587
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:55,731
it was.

4588
02:03:55,731 --> 02:03:56,411
It was interesting.

4589
02:03:56,411 --> 02:03:58,180
We were still dirty from the road.

4590
02:03:58,181 --> 02:03:58,481
Okay.

4591
02:03:58,481 --> 02:03:59,950
We had hadn't shaved.

4592
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,000
We hadn't washed.

4593
02:04:01,001 --> 02:04:05,590
We hadn't bathed in five days and we
were driving from the river to billings,

4594
02:04:05,591 --> 02:04:08,890
which is about two and a half hours and
we stopped and got some food at this

4595
02:04:08,891 --> 02:04:10,690
diner in the middle of fucking nowhere and

4596
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:12,241
walks up and goes,

4597
02:04:12,241 --> 02:04:13,660
you ain't voting for Obama?

4598
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:14,130
Yeah,

4599
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:15,750
he killed two of my boys.

4600
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:16,081
I was like,

4601
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:17,630
now I am yet two of my boys that we.

4602
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:22,320
They got to have a to of mine seal
team and he had a marine hat on,

4603
02:04:22,790 --> 02:04:23,700
had a shrine in the marines.

4604
02:04:23,701 --> 02:04:24,900
He never did a day in combat.

4605
02:04:24,901 --> 02:04:25,651
You can see those guys.

4606
02:04:25,651 --> 02:04:25,921
You're like,

4607
02:04:25,921 --> 02:04:26,401
oh you.

4608
02:04:26,401 --> 02:04:30,570
You were the guy who who fucking fake
an injury when all the other guys were

4609
02:04:30,571 --> 02:04:31,980
going out and that's what I think.

4610
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:34,240
Who knows what he did that
might've been a smart move.

4611
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:36,480
Faking injuries given that much.

4612
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:39,900
My fucking put a desk.

4613
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:42,030
Romney's that projected winner in Georgia.

4614
02:04:42,031 --> 02:04:42,870
That's shocking,

4615
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:44,530
is a really hot land.

4616
02:04:45,110 --> 02:04:46,290
A lot of white people in Georgia,

4617
02:04:46,291 --> 02:04:46,471
dude,

4618
02:04:46,471 --> 02:04:47,161
don't kill yourself,

4619
02:04:47,161 --> 02:04:47,994
don't kid yourself.

4620
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:51,270
George has got some money
to Atlanta specialist.

4621
02:04:51,290 --> 02:04:54,510
It's kind of calmed down there now and
there are a lot of black professionals in

4622
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:55,081
Atlanta,

4623
02:04:55,081 --> 02:04:57,700
like it's really interesting
to kind of a cool thing to see.

4624
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:59,790
Like the hotel I'm staying at his,

4625
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:00,361
you know,

4626
02:05:00,361 --> 02:05:00,681
all,

4627
02:05:00,681 --> 02:05:01,001
all,

4628
02:05:01,001 --> 02:05:04,090
like just kind of mostly
professional black people and,

4629
02:05:04,100 --> 02:05:04,490
and uh,

4630
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:04,630
it's,

4631
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:04,831
it's,

4632
02:05:04,831 --> 02:05:05,030
it's,

4633
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,241
it's,

4634
02:05:05,241 --> 02:05:05,530
it's,

4635
02:05:05,530 --> 02:05:05,610
uh,

4636
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:06,443
there was a lot of,

4637
02:05:06,860 --> 02:05:07,681
I think a lot of middle class,

4638
02:05:07,681 --> 02:05:10,070
upper class black people went down to
it and let Atlanta because there was,

4639
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:12,420
the economy was there and
stuff for them at the time.

4640
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:13,830
And it's pretty cool,

4641
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:14,041
man.

4642
02:05:14,041 --> 02:05:14,301
It's a,

4643
02:05:14,301 --> 02:05:14,760
it's a,

4644
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:16,200
it looks like a town primarily.

4645
02:05:16,201 --> 02:05:18,900
You see a lot of black people
in positions of authority and,

4646
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:20,093
and uh,

4647
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:23,310
and the movie I'm doing right now is
all that and it's really refreshing,

4648
02:05:23,311 --> 02:05:23,491
man.

4649
02:05:23,491 --> 02:05:24,310
It's kind of a cool idea.

4650
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,990
I haven't seen it.

4651
02:05:24,990 --> 02:05:26,580
You see that more in
Atlanta than anywhere.

4652
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,730
Atlanta is a very fascinating in that way.

4653
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:30,730
It's,

4654
02:05:30,730 --> 02:05:31,210
you know,

4655
02:05:31,210 --> 02:05:31,440
to,

4656
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:34,230
to be a young black
person in this country.

4657
02:05:34,231 --> 02:05:35,310
And look for role models,

4658
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:38,010
it's got to be unbelievably hard,

4659
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:39,090
you know,

4660
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:44,090
and to see like a guy like Obama get into
office and have everybody's so fucking

4661
02:05:44,581 --> 02:05:45,930
mad at them and everybody,

4662
02:05:45,931 --> 02:05:49,070
like all these white people
just having said that though,

4663
02:05:49,071 --> 02:05:50,270
the people that did elect him,

4664
02:05:50,271 --> 02:05:51,300
we're at where white people.

4665
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:51,581
Sure.

4666
02:05:51,581 --> 02:05:51,900
No,

4667
02:05:51,900 --> 02:05:52,900
I mean I voted for him.

4668
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:53,551
Yeah,

4669
02:05:53,551 --> 02:05:55,770
like right people read books.

4670
02:05:55,890 --> 02:05:57,480
But the white people don't read books.

4671
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:58,860
Those white people hate him.

4672
02:05:59,310 --> 02:06:01,470
It's interesting when
they listened to like,

4673
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:04,260
I'm not saying that Obama was a saint
and I'm not saying that I'm a supporter

4674
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:06,930
because I certainly wasn't
supportive before he got into office.

4675
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:09,120
But then I think I liked
them as a human being.

4676
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:10,800
Like when I listened to him talk,

4677
02:06:10,801 --> 02:06:12,850
it doesn't sound good Dick Guy.

4678
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,390
I liked him because he strikes
me as eminently sensible.

4679
02:06:15,750 --> 02:06:17,220
I don't think the socialist,

4680
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,240
the one thing he said,

4681
02:06:18,241 --> 02:06:18,660
he said,

4682
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:19,090
he said,

4683
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:20,760
what is the one thing
we don't know about you?

4684
02:06:20,761 --> 02:06:21,540
And he said,

4685
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:24,810
I believe the free enterprise
system is the most important,

4686
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:25,980
uh,

4687
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:26,430
you know,

4688
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:29,560
something to the effect of it's the
most important thing for a high standard

4689
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,130
you're living.

4690
02:06:30,130 --> 02:06:30,851
He said there's but,

4691
02:06:30,851 --> 02:06:31,061
but,

4692
02:06:31,061 --> 02:06:31,300
but,

4693
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,140
but with,

4694
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:33,890
with checks and balances.

4695
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:34,910
And so I think he's,

4696
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:38,600
I don't think he is this far left guy.

4697
02:06:38,601 --> 02:06:41,660
I actually think he's very much in
the middle in a very sensible guy.

4698
02:06:41,661 --> 02:06:43,640
And I think the more I
read about his policies,

4699
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,770
I happen to agree with his foreign policy,

4700
02:06:45,771 --> 02:06:48,350
visa vi Iran and other places
more than I do with Rami.

4701
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:50,120
I just think he's more reasonable.

4702
02:06:50,121 --> 02:06:50,954
Man.

4703
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,010
He's a very smart guy.

4704
02:06:52,040 --> 02:06:54,020
But the issue is that I can't really,

4705
02:06:54,380 --> 02:06:58,550
I don't really see him being
able to do what anybody.

4706
02:06:58,970 --> 02:07:02,240
I don't think there's any one
person that has any real say,

4707
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:02,700
oh,

4708
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:04,190
there never has been in our government.

4709
02:07:04,191 --> 02:07:04,851
You're not supposed to,

4710
02:07:04,851 --> 02:07:05,960
but I know what you're saying.

4711
02:07:05,961 --> 02:07:08,810
But I'm saying it's like all the different
things that he wanted to do before he

4712
02:07:08,811 --> 02:07:09,441
got into office,

4713
02:07:09,441 --> 02:07:10,700
closed Guantanamo Bay,

4714
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,820
you know when he said
he would veto the NDA,

4715
02:07:13,821 --> 02:07:15,170
the all the different things.

4716
02:07:15,171 --> 02:07:19,730
It's so blatantly obvious that the
position is not what we envisioned.

4717
02:07:19,731 --> 02:07:21,020
That was when we were kids.

4718
02:07:21,021 --> 02:07:23,540
We thought of being the president and
this is one guy who was going to figure it

4719
02:07:23,541 --> 02:07:24,050
all out.

4720
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:25,280
Everybody get in line,

4721
02:07:25,281 --> 02:07:26,510
we're going to do this the right way,

4722
02:07:26,511 --> 02:07:28,520
and he leads us to victory like this.

4723
02:07:28,521 --> 02:07:30,920
This system is a fucking complicated.

4724
02:07:31,210 --> 02:07:33,120
Just know maybe what you said.

4725
02:07:33,270 --> 02:07:36,250
What you said is that the biggest thing
is most people don't feel represented.

4726
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:37,170
It's like you know,

4727
02:07:37,180 --> 02:07:37,341
you,

4728
02:07:37,341 --> 02:07:37,631
you,

4729
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:37,901
you,

4730
02:07:37,901 --> 02:07:41,530
you feel like if you vote for Romney or
you vote for Obama is not going to make

4731
02:07:41,590 --> 02:07:44,440
that much of a difference because you're
kind of voting for the same guy in some

4732
02:07:44,441 --> 02:07:44,660
way.

4733
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:44,940
Yeah.

4734
02:07:44,940 --> 02:07:49,940
The that moved into the position of
power that is clearly stronger and more

4735
02:07:50,241 --> 02:07:53,000
influential than the
people can have a big,

4736
02:07:53,030 --> 02:07:57,610
big effect on who gets elected to the
supreme court and socially they have

4737
02:07:57,660 --> 02:07:59,370
an impact on an agenda.

4738
02:07:59,400 --> 02:07:59,731
Right.

4739
02:07:59,731 --> 02:08:00,091
So,

4740
02:08:00,091 --> 02:08:00,810
and I have,

4741
02:08:00,810 --> 02:08:05,490
I actually think that Romney in Obama's
foreign policy or different enough,

4742
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,790
I think that romney is
rattling his sword in Iran.

4743
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:09,510
You know?

4744
02:08:09,510 --> 02:08:10,181
I don't know.

4745
02:08:10,181 --> 02:08:11,580
I just don't agree with.

4746
02:08:12,090 --> 02:08:15,430
I don't think anybody who's a governor
could ever possibly know what it's like

4747
02:08:15,431 --> 02:08:18,850
to be a president at the same way when
Obama was running for office and he said

4748
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:21,400
he would do this about
Afghanistan and mccain went,

4749
02:08:21,401 --> 02:08:21,611
Whoa,

4750
02:08:21,611 --> 02:08:21,821
Whoa,

4751
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:22,470
whoa.

4752
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:23,530
Like you don't you know,

4753
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:23,770
you,

4754
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:25,300
you can't say this is some shit.

4755
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:29,530
When Mccain and Romney and Obama
were campaigning where it was clearly

4756
02:08:29,800 --> 02:08:31,240
campaigning talk,

4757
02:08:31,241 --> 02:08:32,830
it was clearly like speeches,

4758
02:08:33,010 --> 02:08:36,760
but there was a moment when Obama was
talking about Afghanistan and Mccain went

4759
02:08:36,870 --> 02:08:37,210
like,

4760
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:39,160
you don't even know what
you're talking about.

4761
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:43,510
Like you're describing an area that
hasn't changed much since the time of

4762
02:08:43,511 --> 02:08:44,820
Alexander the Great,

4763
02:08:45,090 --> 02:08:48,070
like this idea that you're going to go
in there and just take over the land.

4764
02:08:48,080 --> 02:08:48,913
Like you're,

4765
02:08:48,940 --> 02:08:49,751
that's crazy.

4766
02:08:49,751 --> 02:08:50,530
Talk like,

4767
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:50,861
you know,

4768
02:08:50,861 --> 02:08:51,401
and Mccain,

4769
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,234
the way he did it,

4770
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:52,721
it was like,

4771
02:08:52,721 --> 02:08:52,991
Whoa,

4772
02:08:52,991 --> 02:08:53,231
Whoa,

4773
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:53,500
Whoa,

4774
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:54,010
son.

4775
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:54,520
It was like,

4776
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:55,840
this was a serious topic.

4777
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:58,660
All that fucking campaign
and bullshit aside.

4778
02:08:58,661 --> 02:08:58,811
Like,

4779
02:08:58,811 --> 02:08:59,070
you're,

4780
02:08:59,070 --> 02:08:59,380
you're,

4781
02:08:59,380 --> 02:09:01,020
you're talking about
what I did for a living.

4782
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:02,410
You're talking crazy.

4783
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:05,500
Like you don't know what the with
it's what happens to presidents

4784
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:06,340
realizing it.

4785
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,910
Certainly I got that impression from,

4786
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:09,680
from our scenario where,

4787
02:09:09,810 --> 02:09:10,643
you know,

4788
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:11,820
the impression I got from him,

4789
02:09:11,821 --> 02:09:13,320
what he's saying is that
you don't have any power.

4790
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:13,561
I mean,

4791
02:09:13,561 --> 02:09:13,681
you,

4792
02:09:13,681 --> 02:09:13,861
you,

4793
02:09:13,861 --> 02:09:16,080
you can set an agenda
and you can veto things,

4794
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:16,980
but at the end of the day,

4795
02:09:16,981 --> 02:09:19,710
you're not doing much without congress.

4796
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:20,783
If anything.

4797
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,120
Uh,

4798
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:21,390
and,

4799
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:22,021
and by the way,

4800
02:09:22,021 --> 02:09:23,220
you're dealing with a lot of different,

4801
02:09:23,270 --> 02:09:23,710
you know,

4802
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:24,750
a vested interest

4803
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,110
in the congressional
choices coming up this,

4804
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:27,961
this election,

4805
02:09:27,961 --> 02:09:31,770
it might be more important even than
what's going on with residents because

4806
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:37,100
there's so much fucking waste and so
many dumb people that have gotten into

4807
02:09:37,681 --> 02:09:38,670
elected offices.

4808
02:09:38,820 --> 02:09:42,690
There's so much bullshit there and
slowly but surely it gets exposed,

4809
02:09:42,691 --> 02:09:46,250
but it's still the key
problem never gets addressed.

4810
02:09:46,251 --> 02:09:49,800
The key problem of special interest
groups and funny money there that none of

4811
02:09:49,801 --> 02:09:50,760
that stuff gets addressed.

4812
02:09:51,060 --> 02:09:52,020
So it all stays.

4813
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:53,640
Question also becomes this

4814
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:53,940
though,

4815
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,410
you know,

4816
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:54,801
if,

4817
02:09:54,801 --> 02:09:55,040
if,

4818
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:55,400
if,

4819
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,720
if indeed you have special interest in,

4820
02:09:57,721 --> 02:10:00,080
you're always going to have smart people
that figure out a way to manipulate the

4821
02:10:00,081 --> 02:10:00,441
machine.

4822
02:10:00,441 --> 02:10:00,920
Yeah.

4823
02:10:00,920 --> 02:10:04,370
Then then then is the answer to
make the machine less influential?

4824
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:06,650
Meaning do you make the machine smaller?

4825
02:10:06,830 --> 02:10:08,570
That may be the only way to do it.

4826
02:10:08,571 --> 02:10:10,880
I think that's kind of
the conservative argument,

4827
02:10:11,720 --> 02:10:14,470
but that's the real conservative argument.

4828
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:16,070
Real conservative.

4829
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:18,410
But when you say the
word conserve you though,

4830
02:10:18,411 --> 02:10:18,621
well,

4831
02:10:18,621 --> 02:10:20,210
I don't want queers getting married.

4832
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:21,760
That's the first thing that people think.

4833
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:22,660
I think

4834
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:23,180
I'm not,

4835
02:10:23,180 --> 02:10:24,013
I'm not a,

4836
02:10:24,140 --> 02:10:24,461
I,

4837
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:24,850
I,

4838
02:10:24,850 --> 02:10:25,683
I am.

4839
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:27,020
When I say conservative,

4840
02:10:27,140 --> 02:10:31,550
I just believe that the state shouldn't
be involved in who I choose to marry,

4841
02:10:31,551 --> 02:10:32,600
whether it's channing tatum,

4842
02:10:32,601 --> 02:10:33,434
matthew,

4843
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:33,990
or,

4844
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,280
you know,

4845
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:35,090
a girl.

4846
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:35,421
Sorry,

4847
02:10:35,421 --> 02:10:35,930
I use those.

4848
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:36,700
Sorry.

4849
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:36,890
Uh,

4850
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:37,221
you know,

4851
02:10:37,221 --> 02:10:37,491
or,

4852
02:10:37,491 --> 02:10:37,731
or,

4853
02:10:37,731 --> 02:10:38,930
or the fact that I can't get,

4854
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:40,340
I can't smoke cannabis.

4855
02:10:40,590 --> 02:10:43,340
I'm not saying I'm going to get into
a car and drive to tons of fast moving

4856
02:10:43,341 --> 02:10:44,121
steel if I get caught.

4857
02:10:44,121 --> 02:10:45,290
There are laws for that but,

4858
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:48,470
but let me make my own
choices and my own mistakes,

4859
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:49,770
you know?

4860
02:10:49,770 --> 02:10:51,320
And then when I say conservative,

4861
02:10:51,321 --> 02:10:54,200
I mean I think I'm just talking
about being fiscally conservative.

4862
02:10:54,201 --> 02:10:56,390
I think I'm talking about not
spending what we don't make.

4863
02:10:56,630 --> 02:10:58,070
I lived that way myself.

4864
02:10:58,071 --> 02:10:59,170
I don't know why the government can't.

4865
02:10:59,570 --> 02:10:59,940
It,

4866
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:00,590
it's,

4867
02:11:00,590 --> 02:11:01,251
I don't know why.

4868
02:11:01,251 --> 02:11:02,810
I always have to get why.

4869
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:06,380
The minute I'm at a dinner party in
Los Angeles and I started talking about

4870
02:11:06,440 --> 02:11:07,760
small government or,

4871
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,580
or a conservative idea,

4872
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:15,820
I get labeled immediately as somebody
who is against gay marriage against

4873
02:11:15,831 --> 02:11:16,520
abortion.

4874
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:16,971
No,

4875
02:11:16,971 --> 02:11:18,110
well you're racist.

4876
02:11:18,170 --> 02:11:18,381
Yeah,

4877
02:11:18,381 --> 02:11:19,071
I reject.

4878
02:11:19,071 --> 02:11:22,640
I reject a lot of the republican platform
in that sense because it's just as

4879
02:11:22,641 --> 02:11:24,740
controlling as the other side.

4880
02:11:24,770 --> 02:11:26,210
What about a woman's
right to choose Brian?

4881
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:27,163
I believe in it.

4882
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,120
What if you called it killing babies?

4883
02:11:29,121 --> 02:11:30,320
This is the killing babycenter.

4884
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:30,951
Well,

4885
02:11:30,951 --> 02:11:31,401
that's fine,

4886
02:11:31,401 --> 02:11:33,770
but the problem is we put a
price on human life all the time.

4887
02:11:33,771 --> 02:11:34,670
If you want to save lives,

4888
02:11:34,671 --> 02:11:36,710
how come you're not out petitioning
to make the speed limit on the,

4889
02:11:36,711 --> 02:11:38,240
on the highway 30 miles an hour.

4890
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:38,660
It'll,

4891
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:39,740
it'll fucking save lives.

4892
02:11:39,741 --> 02:11:44,210
You know why we don't do that because
it would be grossly inconvenient and it

4893
02:11:44,211 --> 02:11:46,550
would stall the economy
and our standard of living.

4894
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:47,181
So guess what?

4895
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:48,890
We do put a price on
human life all the time.

4896
02:11:48,891 --> 02:11:51,440
And I happen to believe that if
a woman's for harboring a life,

4897
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:55,130
you can biologically make the case
that it is murder because it's a life.

4898
02:11:55,131 --> 02:11:56,810
It just happens to be on life support.

4899
02:11:57,080 --> 02:11:57,651
Uh,

4900
02:11:57,651 --> 02:11:58,300
that's fine.

4901
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:58,400
Uh,

4902
02:11:58,400 --> 02:11:58,680
I,

4903
02:11:58,680 --> 02:11:59,060
I,

4904
02:11:59,060 --> 02:11:59,720
I still,

4905
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:02,180
I still think a woman's choice to make,

4906
02:12:02,210 --> 02:12:04,970
to do with her body what she
chooses is paramount over that.

4907
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,070
It's not consistent with
the Judaeo Christian ethic,

4908
02:12:07,071 --> 02:12:07,820
but that's.

4909
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:08,720
I don't go to church.

4910
02:12:09,080 --> 02:12:09,261
Yeah.

4911
02:12:09,261 --> 02:12:09,590
But what,

4912
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,640
do you have those times?

4913
02:12:10,670 --> 02:12:13,700
Do you have a timeline where you
think it's a very good question?

4914
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:14,130
I've,

4915
02:12:14,130 --> 02:12:16,610
I've kind of tried to avoid this very,

4916
02:12:16,611 --> 02:12:17,960
very complicated question,

4917
02:12:17,961 --> 02:12:19,040
but we do have timelines.

4918
02:12:19,041 --> 02:12:19,521
First of all,

4919
02:12:19,521 --> 02:12:20,000
right?

4920
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,661
For the most part,

4921
02:12:20,661 --> 02:12:21,620
after the third trimester,

4922
02:12:21,621 --> 02:12:25,100
it becomes very dangerous for the
woman and 48 days in this one,

4923
02:12:25,101 --> 02:12:27,380
the whatever religion thought the,

4924
02:12:27,381 --> 02:12:27,650
uh,

4925
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:28,940
the soul entered the body.

4926
02:12:29,930 --> 02:12:30,450
Well,

4927
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:31,070
the Hindus,

4928
02:12:31,070 --> 02:12:31,550
well,

4929
02:12:31,550 --> 02:12:32,071
if you,

4930
02:12:32,071 --> 02:12:32,360
if you,

4931
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:32,781
let's take,

4932
02:12:32,781 --> 02:12:35,060
let's take a couple of
ethical arguments about it.

4933
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:36,410
So let's take up severely,

4934
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:38,510
severely retarded human being.

4935
02:12:38,511 --> 02:12:39,920
Somebody who can't feed themselves,

4936
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:41,810
somebody who can't even
breathe on their own.

4937
02:12:42,160 --> 02:12:42,740
Um,

4938
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:45,050
and if you were to kill that person,

4939
02:12:45,051 --> 02:12:45,771
if I were to go into some other,

4940
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:46,580
that person with a pillow,

4941
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:50,270
even though they don't have any feeling
and parts they can't communicate,

4942
02:12:50,690 --> 02:12:53,180
then then what would happen
is I'd go to jail for murder.

4943
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:58,840
You take a fetus that is not yet
even developed with its hands ahead,

4944
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:00,320
however reacts to pain.

4945
02:13:00,640 --> 02:13:04,430
We know it is on its way to becoming a
human being and in a lot of aspects of

4946
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:05,001
the human being,

4947
02:13:05,001 --> 02:13:07,190
just a severely
underdeveloped human being.

4948
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:07,420
It's,

4949
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:09,350
it's a very similar thing to kill that.

4950
02:13:09,380 --> 02:13:12,200
That very small creature that is living,

4951
02:13:12,380 --> 02:13:14,180
that does respond to stimuli does it,

4952
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:18,020
does respond to pain and continues to do
so and more and more of a what we would

4953
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:20,030
consider independent human fashion.

4954
02:13:20,510 --> 02:13:23,080
That is that not why is that not murder?

4955
02:13:23,081 --> 02:13:24,500
That would be where the argument is.

4956
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:26,900
It's very hard to actually
get out of that argument.

4957
02:13:27,170 --> 02:13:27,841
It's very hard.

4958
02:13:27,841 --> 02:13:31,410
It's why I have a lot of respect for the
notion that people who say religiously,

4959
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,580
I believe it's murder.

4960
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:33,511
I have to,

4961
02:13:33,511 --> 02:13:35,100
I have to be pro pro life.

4962
02:13:35,270 --> 02:13:35,480
I,

4963
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:40,080
I do respect that because you could make
a very strong biological argument that,

4964
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:43,020
that human being is just as human
as you are in a lot of ways.

4965
02:13:43,050 --> 02:13:45,030
You just have to be independent,

4966
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:46,650
more independent.

4967
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:47,521
Uh,

4968
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:50,100
you're not relying on a human
being to keep you alive.

4969
02:13:50,240 --> 02:13:50,390
Well,

4970
02:13:50,390 --> 02:13:55,110
we're never going to figure out how to
fix that until we figured out how to fix

4971
02:13:55,111 --> 02:14:00,111
the dirty trick of fucking equals making
people that is a dirty God damn trick

4972
02:14:00,571 --> 02:14:01,590
that we need to address.

4973
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:02,010
Well,

4974
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:02,843
because it's so.

4975
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:03,360
I have this

4976
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:07,200
unbelievable desire to fuck
but yet fucking makes people.

4977
02:14:07,201 --> 02:14:08,850
And you can fuck when you're like 13,

4978
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:12,300
but we don't have to run from Jaguars
everyday when we know we're not getting

4979
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:13,860
chased down by crocodiles.

4980
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:15,540
We don't need this many people.

4981
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:15,721
Well,

4982
02:14:15,721 --> 02:14:17,110
not only do you not need this many people,

4983
02:14:17,111 --> 02:14:19,750
as my other argument for
being pro choice and is,

4984
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,960
is that you're going to
take care of that kid.

4985
02:14:22,050 --> 02:14:24,180
You're going to take care of that
child who just got pregnant by,

4986
02:14:24,181 --> 02:14:24,480
by,

4987
02:14:24,480 --> 02:14:25,590
by a woman who has no money.

4988
02:14:25,591 --> 02:14:26,610
Who doesn't want that baby?

4989
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:27,720
She can't take care of it.

4990
02:14:27,870 --> 02:14:30,840
Are you going to or you can have another
ward of the state or somebody who

4991
02:14:30,841 --> 02:14:32,940
doesn't get any attention or
somebody doesn't have any resources.

4992
02:14:32,970 --> 02:14:34,890
We've got to separate the
fact that fucking makes a.

4993
02:14:35,070 --> 02:14:35,881
makes a person.

4994
02:14:35,881 --> 02:14:36,780
You're getting crazy.

4995
02:14:36,990 --> 02:14:38,100
We've got to get to the heart of this.

4996
02:14:38,450 --> 02:14:40,080
We gotta we gotta figure out a way.

4997
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:43,420
So you make a person through
a very complicated process.

4998
02:14:43,580 --> 02:14:44,580
What about birth control?

4999
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:45,481
Well,

5000
02:14:45,481 --> 02:14:46,680
that could fuck up your body.

5001
02:14:47,080 --> 02:14:47,461
You know,

5002
02:14:47,461 --> 02:14:48,001
for women,

5003
02:14:48,001 --> 02:14:51,150
they take pills that essentially trick
their body and thinking they're pregnant

5004
02:14:51,151 --> 02:14:51,511
all the time.

5005
02:14:51,511 --> 02:14:52,151
That can't be good.

5006
02:14:52,151 --> 02:14:52,800
Yeah.

5007
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,630
That condoms also real
real and everything.

5008
02:14:54,990 --> 02:14:55,381
Gross,

5009
02:14:55,381 --> 02:14:58,050
disgusting things such stupid thing.

5010
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,960
Tomorrow I'm having that Peter
Duesberg guy on the podcast.

5011
02:15:00,961 --> 02:15:03,660
He's the guy that believes
that a HIV doesn't cause aids.

5012
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:06,420
It's all people that are doing drugs.

5013
02:15:06,910 --> 02:15:07,743
He said this,

5014
02:15:07,890 --> 02:15:10,200
it's really almost untenable.

5015
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:12,500
Science would be like,

5016
02:15:12,501 --> 02:15:12,880
wow.

5017
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:13,080
Yeah,

5018
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:14,850
well that's why I'm
interested to see how he,

5019
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:15,580
how you,

5020
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,413
you know,

5021
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:18,330
figures that end to.

5022
02:15:18,331 --> 02:15:21,630
The problem is that they're not doing
drugs and there wasting away of HIV.

5023
02:15:21,631 --> 02:15:23,460
So I think the Africa thing though,

5024
02:15:23,461 --> 02:15:25,590
apparently they're not even
getting tested for HIV,

5025
02:15:25,610 --> 02:15:26,070
they're there,

5026
02:15:26,070 --> 02:15:30,150
they have aids and that could be a variety
of things including poor nutrition.

5027
02:15:30,180 --> 02:15:34,560
I think that's the argument there is
that the actual testing and this guy is

5028
02:15:34,590 --> 02:15:36,360
ignoring a lot of the data on that.

5029
02:15:36,370 --> 02:15:37,051
We're gonna find out,

5030
02:15:37,051 --> 02:15:37,620
I don't know,

5031
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:40,560
like you want to do it with me
going to do it when really tomorrow,

5032
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:43,260
tomorrow at 3:00 here.

5033
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:44,153
Yeah.

5034
02:15:44,420 --> 02:15:45,253
Um,

5035
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:47,460
I'd like to come and
listen to them but to 2:00,

5036
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:48,100
2:00,

5037
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:48,933
come and listen.

5038
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:50,520
Please do come and listen to and sit in.

5039
02:15:50,830 --> 02:15:51,030
Right?

5040
02:15:51,030 --> 02:15:51,480
You too,

5041
02:15:51,480 --> 02:15:52,040
please.

5042
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:52,261
All right.

5043
02:15:52,261 --> 02:15:52,771
I mean who knows,

5044
02:15:52,771 --> 02:15:53,604
cause my,

5045
02:15:53,660 --> 02:15:54,493
this is just uh,

5046
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:54,781
look,

5047
02:15:54,781 --> 02:15:55,091
I,

5048
02:15:55,091 --> 02:15:59,100
I read about this guy's position a
long time ago and I thought it was

5049
02:15:59,101 --> 02:15:59,551
fascinating.

5050
02:15:59,551 --> 02:16:00,750
I've read a bunch of articles,

5051
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:04,050
but what bothers me about a guy like this
is very simple and I'll bring it up to

5052
02:16:04,060 --> 02:16:04,893
them.

5053
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:06,900
I watched a lot of people die in New York.

5054
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:09,630
I watched them have it with my
own eyes without medication.

5055
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,190
This is before they had magic medication.

5056
02:16:12,191 --> 02:16:12,860
This is one where they had,

5057
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,670
they had act and I watched them all dot.

5058
02:16:14,671 --> 02:16:14,881
Yeah,

5059
02:16:14,881 --> 02:16:18,270
that was one of the main and I watched
him die in a very humiliating and a very

5060
02:16:18,271 --> 02:16:19,104
terrible way.

5061
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:22,500
Do you know that act is a
cancer medication that they
stopped giving the chemo

5062
02:16:22,501 --> 02:16:24,780
patients because it was killing
them quicker than not having.

5063
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:25,020
Well,

5064
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:25,651
I don't know,

5065
02:16:25,651 --> 02:16:28,980
but I do know that a lot of these
people went the alternative route and

5066
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:29,561
everything else.

5067
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:34,090
I know a couple of people that stopped
doing it and then along came a guy I

5068
02:16:34,091 --> 02:16:38,200
believe by the name of David Ho who was
a scientist who was man of the year Time

5069
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:40,660
Magazine's man of the year who invented
a little something called protease

5070
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:41,523
inhibitors.

5071
02:16:41,920 --> 02:16:45,910
Protease inhibitors make the cell wall
the the I guess the helper t cell,

5072
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:46,690
very slick.

5073
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:51,690
They covered coated with a teflon so that
the virus cannot latch onto that sail.

5074
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:57,730
It's gooey and so what happens is with
protease inhibitors now you have people

5075
02:16:57,731 --> 02:17:00,040
who are HIV positive and
used to be a death sentence.

5076
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:00,933
Right?

5077
02:17:01,420 --> 02:17:04,840
I can remember it like it was yesterday
and I watched it happen and now you get

5078
02:17:04,841 --> 02:17:06,100
people who are HIV positive.

5079
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:11,101
I know several who treat it like it's
diabetes and in fact now when you get HIV,

5080
02:17:11,441 --> 02:17:12,490
a lot of doctors will say,

5081
02:17:12,491 --> 02:17:12,701
hey,

5082
02:17:12,701 --> 02:17:13,534
good news.

5083
02:17:13,540 --> 02:17:14,980
This could be diabetes,

5084
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:18,250
will keep you alive for the next
30 years on protease inhibitors.

5085
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:19,540
That's a miracle.

5086
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:22,360
These people that got HIV,

5087
02:17:22,390 --> 02:17:25,270
do any of them engage in illicit drug use?

5088
02:17:25,390 --> 02:17:26,223
Some of them do.

5089
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:26,830
Some of them.

5090
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:27,663
Some of them do.

5091
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:28,661
I believe.

5092
02:17:28,661 --> 02:17:33,370
What duesberg point is that the only
reason why the HIV wasn't fought off by

5093
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:37,780
their immune system was that their
immune system was destroyed by the use of

5094
02:17:37,870 --> 02:17:38,703
drugs,

5095
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:39,370
meth,

5096
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:40,240
emile nitrates,

5097
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:40,910
bunch of different things.

5098
02:17:40,910 --> 02:17:44,860
I'm going to ask him about why wanting
rica is talks about and the bulk of the

5099
02:17:44,861 --> 02:17:49,510
science is that the reason that it
never became a white European disease.

5100
02:17:49,511 --> 02:17:49,811
Why?

5101
02:17:49,811 --> 02:17:51,550
Why didn't white men,

5102
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,050
straight men get it,

5103
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,940
but a lot of them got in Africa.

5104
02:17:54,941 --> 02:17:57,400
Why was it a heterosexual
disease in Africa?

5105
02:17:57,401 --> 02:18:01,810
Why was it not a heterosexual disease
in the Middle East and in Europe and in

5106
02:18:01,811 --> 02:18:02,261
America?

5107
02:18:02,261 --> 02:18:03,094
Why?

5108
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:03,760
Well,

5109
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,090
they just isolated a gene that you,

5110
02:18:07,091 --> 02:18:08,650
if you are of northern European,

5111
02:18:08,651 --> 02:18:09,484
Middle Eastern,

5112
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:12,550
north African heritage,

5113
02:18:13,060 --> 02:18:18,060
you have a gene that saved you from the
black plagues of that hit Europe enroll

5114
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:19,670
to all,

5115
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:20,680
all the Fertile Crescent.

5116
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:22,240
You have a gene.

5117
02:18:22,241 --> 02:18:23,500
I can't remember the name of the gene.

5118
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:28,740
That gene makes you very resistant to
the HIV virus to contracting it through

5119
02:18:30,431 --> 02:18:31,510
regular sex.

5120
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:33,850
The only straight men for the most part,

5121
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:35,560
if you look at the army
statistics and stuff,

5122
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:40,510
who ca who got HIV were guys who were
intravenous drug users using infected

5123
02:18:40,511 --> 02:18:43,210
needles and they were putting it
into directly into their bloodstream.

5124
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:46,930
The gay men that survived the epidemic.

5125
02:18:46,960 --> 02:18:49,600
We're men who are doing the
fucking not getting fucked.

5126
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:52,860
Those were the men that survived
the epidemic because it was a.

5127
02:18:53,590 --> 02:18:54,161
let me tell you,

5128
02:18:54,161 --> 02:18:58,180
it aids in the eighties and the early
nineties devastated the gay community,

5129
02:18:58,300 --> 02:18:59,330
devastated it.

5130
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:00,280
It was a war zone.

5131
02:19:00,281 --> 02:19:02,200
I walked those men walk around.

5132
02:19:02,410 --> 02:19:03,240
I've watched listening.

5133
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:03,761
What you're saying,

5134
02:19:03,761 --> 02:19:05,680
you're essentially
supporting this guy's theory.

5135
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:05,981
No,

5136
02:19:05,981 --> 02:19:08,980
I'm not saying that the people that
got at world intravenous drug users.

5137
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:09,340
No,

5138
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:10,173
I'm not saying that.

5139
02:19:10,870 --> 02:19:13,420
I'm saying that to get to get to get you.

5140
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:17,650
You ain't mainly intruded with
the people that were very.

5141
02:19:17,750 --> 02:19:20,830
They're very resilient physically because
they had excellent genes that they've

5142
02:19:20,860 --> 02:19:23,470
gotten from surviving
from the black plague.

5143
02:19:23,500 --> 02:19:24,100
The black plague.

5144
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:24,431
Yes,

5145
02:19:24,431 --> 02:19:26,950
but it would be very strong unless.

5146
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:27,890
Unless you were getting.

5147
02:19:28,330 --> 02:19:32,070
You were getting injected into your
body directly through the semen,

5148
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:35,400
through your anus or or through.

5149
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:37,320
Yes,

5150
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:41,000
I did because I just think it's funny
that I'm saying I sound like a scientist,

5151
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:42,030
so I'm so,

5152
02:19:42,210 --> 02:19:46,490
so about this guy who was the
University of California biologist,

5153
02:19:46,491 --> 02:19:47,490
a tenured professor.

5154
02:19:47,550 --> 02:19:51,070
Why would he he not know this that
you're telling what your title.

5155
02:19:51,090 --> 02:19:52,070
I don't know if he knows it,

5156
02:19:52,071 --> 02:19:54,260
but I'm going to bring it up to him and
the other thing that I'm going to ask

5157
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:55,190
Duesberg as this,

5158
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:55,610
hey,

5159
02:19:55,610 --> 02:20:00,610
how come the majority of scientists all
over the world and all the money that

5160
02:20:00,801 --> 02:20:02,750
goes into these protease inhibitors,

5161
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:03,981
protease inhibitors,

5162
02:20:03,981 --> 02:20:04,790
work,

5163
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:08,840
they seem to work and why are people
staying alive when I remember them dying?

5164
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:09,061
Well,

5165
02:20:09,061 --> 02:20:09,970
what's in that tool?

5166
02:20:09,990 --> 02:20:11,630
Let's let him let him answer.

5167
02:20:11,631 --> 02:20:15,950
Those were fucking proposing seems
every time I meet with these guys,

5168
02:20:15,951 --> 02:20:18,410
they're the only guy I've
every other scientists must be,

5169
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,010
you know,

5170
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:19,550
I don't know.

5171
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:23,570
Have you ever looked up like how many
scientists don't believe HIV causes AIDS?

5172
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:24,610
Because.

5173
02:20:24,610 --> 02:20:25,490
Let's go with that right now.

5174
02:20:25,750 --> 02:20:26,461
Let's take a guest.

5175
02:20:26,461 --> 02:20:27,280
Seven.

5176
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:28,113
Okay.

5177
02:20:28,390 --> 02:20:30,390
How many scientists to this?

5178
02:20:30,620 --> 02:20:32,540
I just know that the credible,

5179
02:20:32,541 --> 02:20:36,320
credible journalists and people
who really follow this stuff.

5180
02:20:36,840 --> 02:20:40,430
I'm including people like
Clinton and and like that.

5181
02:20:40,431 --> 02:20:41,060
Clinton.

5182
02:20:41,060 --> 02:20:41,893
Yeah.

5183
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:44,870
Bill Clinton and Linda did a
lot of work for AIDS in Africa.

5184
02:20:44,871 --> 02:20:49,871
A great deal of sort of George go over
there and fuck up a storm water to be all

5185
02:20:50,121 --> 02:20:51,060
dirty,

5186
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:52,220
dirty,

5187
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:53,060
slick willie.

5188
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,840
I'm going to help you out.

5189
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:57,830
Will you go to a aids and
how many scientists don't
believe HIV causes aids and

5190
02:20:57,831 --> 02:21:00,320
it's Duesberg on aids article in spin.

5191
02:21:00,321 --> 02:21:02,270
That's the first fucking
thing that comes up.

5192
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:02,931
Yeah.

5193
02:21:02,931 --> 02:21:03,230
Well,

5194
02:21:03,230 --> 02:21:03,910
um,

5195
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:04,743
I don't really.

5196
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:07,910
My Endo an HIV and aids,

5197
02:21:08,570 --> 02:21:10,460
I have a feeling my room
would be a lot fuller.

5198
02:21:10,700 --> 02:21:11,840
Kary Mullis

5199
02:21:13,230 --> 02:21:13,900
hm.

5200
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:14,733
I think.

5201
02:21:16,030 --> 02:21:16,863
Hm.

5202
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:21,290
Either way if you get HIV,

5203
02:21:21,291 --> 02:21:23,090
it's a very serious diagnosis.

5204
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:23,721
This is what Carrie.

5205
02:21:23,721 --> 02:21:24,560
Carrie Moss is a,

5206
02:21:24,561 --> 02:21:27,240
a Nobel prize winning scientist and uh,

5207
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:28,130
he's um,

5208
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:30,620
he's also always an Lsd user.

5209
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:31,580
He created a,

5210
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:33,350
the invention of PCR test.

5211
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,453
You know,

5212
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:40,250
he won the prize for chemistry and
a crazy smart people out there.

5213
02:21:40,630 --> 02:21:41,463
Yeah,

5214
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:42,470
absolutely.

5215
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:45,650
But what he says is everyone in the
field knows that there's at least some

5216
02:21:45,651 --> 02:21:50,090
dissension over whether there's evidence
that HIV is the probable cause of aids.

5217
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,140
There somewhere in the literature that
there scientific evidence presented that

5218
02:21:54,141 --> 02:21:55,700
HIV is the probable cause of aids.

5219
02:21:55,701 --> 02:21:56,750
And if there is,

5220
02:21:56,751 --> 02:21:57,584
where is it?

5221
02:21:58,130 --> 02:22:02,240
Who should be attributed
with the scientific evidence
supporting that statement.

5222
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:04,610
HIV is a probable cause of a tasting.

5223
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:05,420
This guy,

5224
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:06,770
the fact that he just said that,

5225
02:22:06,771 --> 02:22:07,604
if that's,

5226
02:22:07,640 --> 02:22:08,750
if that's what you did,

5227
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:08,990
say.

5228
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:09,231
Okay.

5229
02:22:09,231 --> 02:22:10,010
By the way,

5230
02:22:10,010 --> 02:22:10,281
stop.

5231
02:22:10,281 --> 02:22:10,461
Stop,

5232
02:22:10,461 --> 02:22:10,671
stop,

5233
02:22:10,671 --> 02:22:10,881
stop.

5234
02:22:10,881 --> 02:22:11,420
Stop.

5235
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:12,253
Nineteen 94.

5236
02:22:12,340 --> 02:22:12,520
Oh,

5237
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:12,830
okay.

5238
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:13,220
Okay.

5239
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:13,720
Thank you.

5240
02:22:13,720 --> 02:22:14,270
I was like,

5241
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:15,590
I had to scroll up to the top.

5242
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:18,590
We're going to shit all over the guy
looking at it like I already figured it,

5243
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:19,424
but meanwhile he's dead.

5244
02:22:19,470 --> 02:22:19,950
He's like,

5245
02:22:19,950 --> 02:22:21,170
he can't even defend himself.

5246
02:22:21,530 --> 02:22:23,600
Does HIV really cause aids if you just.

5247
02:22:23,601 --> 02:22:24,650
Google does HIV.

5248
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:29,100
Really it and most people
think that argument's been
put to put to rest in 2012.

5249
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:29,401
Well,

5250
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:29,611
yeah.

5251
02:22:29,611 --> 02:22:30,990
This is 1994.

5252
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:34,080
It seems like a lot of people
had some questions about it.

5253
02:22:34,610 --> 02:22:35,443
I'll make their names.

5254
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:39,450
I remember somebody they
thought age was in mosquitoes.

5255
02:22:39,451 --> 02:22:42,010
It was about the same time period
isn't somebody will make their name by

5256
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:44,260
basically being controversial.

5257
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:44,820
Well,

5258
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:45,040
I'm,

5259
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:45,751
I'm curious,

5260
02:22:45,751 --> 02:22:46,071
cynical,

5261
02:22:46,071 --> 02:22:48,390
but I'm curious if there's any,

5262
02:22:48,750 --> 02:22:52,470
anything that he's going to say that's
gonna Rattle that opinion of yours.

5263
02:22:52,820 --> 02:22:53,090
Uh,

5264
02:22:53,090 --> 02:22:54,390
obviously this guy has,

5265
02:22:55,140 --> 02:22:57,390
he's been pushing this for a long,

5266
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:58,224
long time.

5267
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:01,290
I don't know if he's the only
one we'll find out from him,

5268
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:05,280
but in 1993 he had an
article in Spin magazine.

5269
02:23:05,281 --> 02:23:08,880
That was the first one that I read that
addressed the whole age thing and that

5270
02:23:08,881 --> 02:23:10,070
was right after my first aids.

5271
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:12,840
You get anybody on the entire
science on the other side,

5272
02:23:12,841 --> 02:23:13,674
on the phone?

5273
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:14,490
No,

5274
02:23:14,490 --> 02:23:15,241
but you know what,

5275
02:23:15,241 --> 02:23:15,511
we'll,

5276
02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:15,811
we'll,

5277
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:16,644
we'll eventually.

5278
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:18,690
It was hard getting him in
here in the first place.

5279
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:20,190
I didn't bring him in here for a debate,

5280
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:20,581
you know,

5281
02:23:20,581 --> 02:23:24,200
so we kind of to the tricky
thing when people said,

5282
02:23:24,201 --> 02:23:27,090
why don't you go after people when they
were to show you something stupid first

5283
02:23:27,091 --> 02:23:27,211
of all,

5284
02:23:27,211 --> 02:23:28,290
because I don't want to be mean.

5285
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,041
And second of all,

5286
02:23:29,041 --> 02:23:32,550
I want them to express themselves to the
fullest extent of their possibilities.

5287
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,211
I don't,

5288
02:23:33,211 --> 02:23:34,480
I don't want to suppress.

5289
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:35,180
I don't,

5290
02:23:35,180 --> 02:23:35,730
you know,

5291
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:39,870
I may disagree with someone on some
things and we may disagree and argue about

5292
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:41,130
stuff on the podcast,

5293
02:23:41,131 --> 02:23:45,030
but in order to find out what someone
really believes about something,

5294
02:23:45,031 --> 02:23:48,990
sometimes you have to not question
it so much as just sort of probe and,

5295
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:51,000
and let them keep going
and people are like,

5296
02:23:51,001 --> 02:23:51,990
why don't you call them out on that?

5297
02:23:51,990 --> 02:23:52,350
I'm like,

5298
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:52,801
you know,

5299
02:23:52,801 --> 02:23:53,281
that's bullshit.

5300
02:23:53,281 --> 02:23:55,410
And like I want to hear
what their logic is.

5301
02:23:55,411 --> 02:23:59,310
I want to hear what their thought process
when I have such strong political.

5302
02:23:59,311 --> 02:23:59,820
Like I'll get,

5303
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:02,520
I'll get heated if you
start talking about how,

5304
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:02,730
you know,

5305
02:24:02,730 --> 02:24:05,970
you can start giving me left wing
solutions to like economic solutions to

5306
02:24:05,971 --> 02:24:06,240
things.

5307
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:07,620
I get overheated and bunched up,

5308
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:09,650
but if we had socialism but,

5309
02:24:09,651 --> 02:24:11,310
but at the same time it
just helped everybody.

5310
02:24:11,890 --> 02:24:13,800
I went hunting and going hunting.

5311
02:24:13,801 --> 02:24:17,490
I had no idea that hunting with have
a political effect on me politically.

5312
02:24:17,491 --> 02:24:18,360
Like it was very interesting.

5313
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,880
What were you go if you,

5314
02:24:19,881 --> 02:24:20,310
if you.

5315
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:21,810
Sometimes I have to check myself and go,

5316
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:26,811
how much of this is attitude and how
I've been raised to actually really

5317
02:24:27,690 --> 02:24:29,310
stopping and looking at fat.

5318
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,770
You have to always check
yourself because you know,

5319
02:24:31,771 --> 02:24:32,730
if you're a change,

5320
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:34,320
what's the hunting thing that changed?

5321
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:35,071
Like I just,

5322
02:24:35,071 --> 02:24:35,940
I just have,

5323
02:24:35,941 --> 02:24:36,660
I have,

5324
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:38,490
I have a new found respect for,

5325
02:24:38,520 --> 02:24:43,520
for that aspect of regulation and strong
laws that make it very clear that you

5326
02:24:44,131 --> 02:24:45,690
can't and not you.

5327
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:50,010
You can't trust hunters to be
libertarian about their hunting practices

5328
02:24:50,011 --> 02:24:53,610
necessarily because you get a lot of
people out there in this world that a lot

5329
02:24:53,611 --> 02:24:54,870
of hunters are vastly.

5330
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:55,530
Vast.

5331
02:24:55,530 --> 02:24:57,480
Majority of real hunters
are very responsible,

5332
02:24:57,481 --> 02:25:00,400
but you get a lot of jerk offs who go
out there and just want a machine gun.

5333
02:25:00,401 --> 02:25:02,190
And I think that the hunters,

5334
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:02,730
um,

5335
02:25:02,730 --> 02:25:06,660
I think the anti hunting people
ultimately the sentiment,

5336
02:25:06,661 --> 02:25:09,180
the idea behind what they're saying,

5337
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:11,640
what offends them about hunting is noble.

5338
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,300
Cause I think what they're trying to do
is protect animals from ruthless people.

5339
02:25:15,301 --> 02:25:19,830
And I think that there are of the mind
that we can get along in harmony with

5340
02:25:19,831 --> 02:25:20,610
nature.

5341
02:25:20,610 --> 02:25:23,010
And that they know that in
their own personal experiences,

5342
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,780
they've had beautiful moments that they've
seen wildlife and they didn't have to

5343
02:25:25,781 --> 02:25:26,614
kill it.

5344
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,830
So I think ultimately know,

5345
02:25:30,190 --> 02:25:33,690
like when you trap an animal and you're
making a fur coat and that animal

5346
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:34,390
writhing in a,

5347
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:35,223
in a trap,

5348
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:36,580
I wouldn't want to fucking see that.

5349
02:25:36,581 --> 02:25:38,500
I went to Portugal and
walks to both fight.

5350
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:39,430
I was,

5351
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:42,160
I've never rooted for a
fucking human being to die so,

5352
02:25:42,350 --> 02:25:43,181
so hard in my life.

5353
02:25:43,181 --> 02:25:43,601
They were like,

5354
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:44,650
spearing this bull.

5355
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:45,730
He was in pain.

5356
02:25:45,731 --> 02:25:48,640
They rub its eyes with a
hot peppers so it can't see.

5357
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,650
And every time they had
to pick a piccadilly would
stick those fucking spirits

5358
02:25:51,651 --> 02:25:52,330
and it's back.

5359
02:25:52,330 --> 02:25:54,430
The thing would jump and ride and pain.

5360
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:55,473
And I was like,

5361
02:25:55,630 --> 02:25:56,291
can some.

5362
02:25:56,291 --> 02:25:58,480
I hope one of these humans fucking dies.

5363
02:25:58,481 --> 02:25:59,920
And this ring that I had done,

5364
02:25:59,921 --> 02:26:01,320
I watched these guys fucking like,

5365
02:26:01,360 --> 02:26:02,490
let themselves get Gordon.

5366
02:26:02,490 --> 02:26:06,740
There were the toughest motherfuckers on
the planet that's not gone to the bull.

5367
02:26:06,741 --> 02:26:08,440
Didn't have a sharp horns.

5368
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:11,170
And they'd let these bullets just fucking
hit them and throw them over their

5369
02:26:11,171 --> 02:26:11,561
backs.

5370
02:26:11,561 --> 02:26:12,550
And they do flips in there.

5371
02:26:12,551 --> 02:26:13,660
There were a total bad asses,

5372
02:26:13,661 --> 02:26:14,430
but,

5373
02:26:14,430 --> 02:26:15,041
but either way,

5374
02:26:15,041 --> 02:26:18,970
I just didn't want to see an animal
suffering aspect of human nature.

5375
02:26:18,980 --> 02:26:23,230
I didn't want to see a fucking a fucking
a defenseless animal rive in pain.

5376
02:26:23,231 --> 02:26:24,160
I didn't like that shit.

5377
02:26:24,280 --> 02:26:24,521
No,

5378
02:26:24,521 --> 02:26:25,290
it's disgusting.

5379
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:26,630
But you know,

5380
02:26:26,640 --> 02:26:27,880
so we have to then.

5381
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:29,290
Then the argument is like,

5382
02:26:29,291 --> 02:26:29,561
okay,

5383
02:26:29,561 --> 02:26:32,920
well then you gotta look at the
vegetarian or Vegan argument,

5384
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:33,431
you know,

5385
02:26:33,431 --> 02:26:34,011
will there,

5386
02:26:34,011 --> 02:26:38,670
they're trying to be as free of
this negative Karma of murdering.

5387
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:41,560
Shouldn't say murder because he gets
murdered was only prism as a form of

5388
02:26:41,561 --> 02:26:42,520
religion in some ways.

5389
02:26:42,521 --> 02:26:42,701
Right?

5390
02:26:42,701 --> 02:26:43,960
I mean it seems to be sort of.

5391
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,280
I mean it's a philosophy,

5392
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:47,080
but the,

5393
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:49,180
my point is like how does,

5394
02:26:49,360 --> 02:26:50,920
how does one manage the animals done?

5395
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:54,740
If we get to that point where
no one's eating any animals,

5396
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:56,170
what are you going to do?

5397
02:26:56,170 --> 02:26:57,070
You're going to castrate them.

5398
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:58,660
What are you going to do
about the deer and the wild,

5399
02:26:58,690 --> 02:26:59,410
what are you going to do?

5400
02:26:59,410 --> 02:27:03,370
We're going to have a real
issue and that's something
that no one needs to mean.

5401
02:27:03,550 --> 02:27:06,460
We have to grow as much
animal protein first of all,

5402
02:27:06,461 --> 02:27:06,731
right.

5403
02:27:06,731 --> 02:27:06,910
You,

5404
02:27:06,910 --> 02:27:07,481
it doesn't matter.

5405
02:27:07,481 --> 02:27:09,330
What are you going to do with the feed?

5406
02:27:09,340 --> 02:27:11,020
I don't think you'd be able
to feed as many people.

5407
02:27:11,021 --> 02:27:14,260
So would you just let the cows
starve to death and cows go extinct?

5408
02:27:14,261 --> 02:27:17,740
Or would you manage a population
of them that you never bred?

5409
02:27:17,741 --> 02:27:20,830
Are you suppose you'd stopped
breathing when she let them go wild.

5410
02:27:20,830 --> 02:27:21,431
And if you did,

5411
02:27:21,431 --> 02:27:22,810
they wouldn't have any natural predators.

5412
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:24,530
They did the big question that like,

5413
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:25,930
like fucking awesome.

5414
02:27:25,960 --> 02:27:26,793
Uh,

5415
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:27,850
Ray Kurzweil says,

5416
02:27:28,120 --> 02:27:28,570
listen,

5417
02:27:28,570 --> 02:27:29,381
we're very,

5418
02:27:29,381 --> 02:27:30,730
very soon you're going to be,

5419
02:27:30,731 --> 02:27:34,030
we're going to be cloning a meat
that has no animal suffering.

5420
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:35,260
We're going to be cloning,

5421
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:36,580
meet with no central nervous system.

5422
02:27:36,581 --> 02:27:37,570
Kind of taste like shit.

5423
02:27:37,630 --> 02:27:37,871
Well,

5424
02:27:37,871 --> 02:27:38,201
no,

5425
02:27:38,201 --> 02:27:41,680
because we can clone the best tasting
meat in the world if you've got in a

5426
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:42,341
factory.

5427
02:27:42,341 --> 02:27:46,210
So I'm just saying the future is
going to be a far a meat farm.

5428
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:50,230
You ever see like salmon that you
buy that hasn't been dyed pink.

5429
02:27:50,450 --> 02:27:50,860
Really?

5430
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:51,770
See what those.

5431
02:27:51,771 --> 02:27:52,050
Yes.

5432
02:27:52,050 --> 02:27:54,070
Weak ass prison bitch salmon.

5433
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,401
Yeah.

5434
02:27:54,401 --> 02:27:56,500
But what what I'm saying is
that at the end of the day,

5435
02:27:56,501 --> 02:27:59,170
I think technology is going to
give you the greatest tasting,

5436
02:27:59,171 --> 02:28:02,680
everything without animal suffering and
meat's going to be just like anything

5437
02:28:02,681 --> 02:28:03,010
else.

5438
02:28:03,010 --> 02:28:06,220
It's going to be you're gonna buy a
meat ball that was grown in some fucking

5439
02:28:06,221 --> 02:28:07,054
farm.

5440
02:28:07,430 --> 02:28:11,260
Wonder if it's possible to get the
subtle nuances of legere good grass fed

5441
02:28:11,261 --> 02:28:12,010
steak.

5442
02:28:12,010 --> 02:28:12,341
I one,

5443
02:28:12,341 --> 02:28:15,940
if you can get that or for wonder if it's
going to be like sorta like grape gum

5444
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:17,860
where it's not really grape gum,

5445
02:28:17,861 --> 02:28:19,850
but you call it grape gum flavors.

5446
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:20,250
Grape.

5447
02:28:20,250 --> 02:28:20,451
Oh,

5448
02:28:20,451 --> 02:28:21,090
I love group.

5449
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:21,923
It doesn't say anything.

5450
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:24,230
That's why I like game meat so much.

5451
02:28:24,231 --> 02:28:26,690
You can't compete with that fucking game.

5452
02:28:26,830 --> 02:28:27,610
Not Game Me.

5453
02:28:27,610 --> 02:28:28,980
Brian Endgame.

5454
02:28:29,610 --> 02:28:30,620
I'm like grape soda?

5455
02:28:30,621 --> 02:28:31,251
There's grape soda.

5456
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:32,540
Taste anything like a grape?

5457
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:32,990
No,

5458
02:28:32,990 --> 02:28:33,640
not at all.

5459
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:34,520
It's like the color,

5460
02:28:34,750 --> 02:28:36,290
maybe Welch's grape juice.

5461
02:28:36,291 --> 02:28:36,720
It's about us.

5462
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:37,940
That's real grape juice.

5463
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:40,820
They're like sweet.

5464
02:28:40,821 --> 02:28:41,570
But yeah,

5465
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:42,740
but like think about like,

5466
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,480
what's the difference
between like grape Hubba,

5467
02:28:44,481 --> 02:28:46,640
bubba bubble gum and like an actual great.

5468
02:28:46,641 --> 02:28:48,200
But how do you even know
that that's a great.

5469
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:48,981
You know,

5470
02:28:48,981 --> 02:28:52,580
it's a great because you've accepted
this as the substitute grape flavor,

5471
02:28:52,581 --> 02:28:54,950
even though it's not nothing
great blank about it.

5472
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:55,790
You call it.

5473
02:28:55,790 --> 02:28:56,930
That's great flavor.

5474
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:57,610
You know,

5475
02:28:57,610 --> 02:28:58,940
that's what stakes going to be like.

5476
02:28:58,941 --> 02:29:00,020
We're going to get used to that.

5477
02:29:00,070 --> 02:29:02,570
We're going to use this artificial non,

5478
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:03,140
you know,

5479
02:29:03,140 --> 02:29:07,220
non biological or they'll be able to
figure out a way to put all those nuances

5480
02:29:07,221 --> 02:29:09,810
and when they do the first people that
either they're going to get cancer the

5481
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:11,090
like immediately

5482
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,610
I wonder.

5483
02:29:13,610 --> 02:29:16,730
It seems like how long can
you keep tricking the system?

5484
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:16,911
Well,

5485
02:29:16,911 --> 02:29:20,150
the only way we're going to feed
as many people as we do with as we,

5486
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:20,990
as we get into nine,

5487
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,370
10 billion people in the century
is with genetically modified foods.

5488
02:29:25,371 --> 02:29:27,070
You're not doing any other 10 billion.

5489
02:29:27,110 --> 02:29:29,330
You have to figure out a way
to make rice more nutritious.

5490
02:29:29,331 --> 02:29:30,420
That's what golden rice product,

5491
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:32,090
that golden rice project is all about.

5492
02:29:32,330 --> 02:29:34,500
I guess getting more
vitamin a into rice and,

5493
02:29:34,810 --> 02:29:35,110
and,

5494
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:38,690
and making it way more nutritious
to make sure that more people breed.

5495
02:29:38,691 --> 02:29:39,920
So we have even more people.

5496
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:40,890
Well,

5497
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:41,840
that's very important,

5498
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:46,990
isn't the most important thing to figure
out how to make these places less poor,

5499
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:48,400
you know,

5500
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:52,100
like when you look at all the poverty in
the world and all of these people that

5501
02:29:52,101 --> 02:29:57,101
are in these incredibly over populated
areas like how does one ever managed the

5502
02:29:57,741 --> 02:29:59,840
human animal,

5503
02:29:59,841 --> 02:30:01,760
the human race from the ground up,

5504
02:30:01,970 --> 02:30:06,680
the lowest form growing far more
food per hectare than we ever have,

5505
02:30:06,681 --> 02:30:06,891
right?

5506
02:30:06,891 --> 02:30:09,470
With technology and making
it more nutrient dense.

5507
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:14,090
So the idea is like if you create
staples of crops like rice,

5508
02:30:14,091 --> 02:30:14,690
that is,

5509
02:30:14,690 --> 02:30:16,760
that is as nutritious as a root vegetable,

5510
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:17,660
like a sweet potato.

5511
02:30:17,810 --> 02:30:18,290
So your,

5512
02:30:18,290 --> 02:30:20,900
your thing is to take these people that
live in these poor places and make them

5513
02:30:20,901 --> 02:30:21,734
farmers.

5514
02:30:21,910 --> 02:30:22,360
No,

5515
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:25,550
actually you'll need less farmers and
you'll need less pesticides because what

5516
02:30:25,551 --> 02:30:28,310
you'll do is you're genetically modified
these foods too and they're already

5517
02:30:28,311 --> 02:30:30,930
doing this to resist a,

5518
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:34,910
the need for artificial pesticides because
they have built in resistance to the

5519
02:30:34,911 --> 02:30:36,710
pests that are indigenous to that area.

5520
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:37,671
And that's what.

5521
02:30:37,671 --> 02:30:39,020
That's what this is all about.

5522
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:42,170
Genetically modified
foods gets such a bad rap,

5523
02:30:42,171 --> 02:30:43,220
but that's the future.

5524
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:45,470
We're not gonna feed
people without it really.

5525
02:30:45,490 --> 02:30:47,370
Do you think that the thing with a,

5526
02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:52,190
with taking these genetically modified
foods and copywriting them and making

5527
02:30:52,191 --> 02:30:54,920
sure that people have that,

5528
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:55,820
you know,

5529
02:30:55,820 --> 02:30:59,630
making sure the seeds can't grow
suicide's not the answer to that.

5530
02:30:59,690 --> 02:31:01,580
When it starts becoming a commodity,

5531
02:31:01,581 --> 02:31:02,650
it gets a little weird.

5532
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:03,870
You know?

5533
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:04,281
It has been.

5534
02:31:04,281 --> 02:31:05,750
I think it's just
becoming more complicated.

5535
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:06,650
Trademark life.

5536
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:09,200
It's a really interesting question
though because like you're right if you,

5537
02:31:09,210 --> 02:31:09,561
if you.

5538
02:31:09,561 --> 02:31:11,990
But if you spend a lot of time
in a laboratory and you create a,

5539
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:16,250
the most nutritious rice kernel in the
world that people can live on just rice.

5540
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:19,590
Well then if that was all your hard work,

5541
02:31:19,770 --> 02:31:21,630
I guess you should own
the rights to the seed.

5542
02:31:21,631 --> 02:31:22,170
Right?

5543
02:31:22,170 --> 02:31:24,600
Well maybe you should
just get a cut forever.

5544
02:31:24,620 --> 02:31:24,790
Yeah,

5545
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:27,900
because because otherwise people wouldn't
be the incentive to develop that is

5546
02:31:27,901 --> 02:31:29,190
not only just a humanitarian one,

5547
02:31:29,191 --> 02:31:30,510
but it's also a profit motive.

5548
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:31,950
Senator Incentive.

5549
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:34,650
That's why you've put billions of
dollars into research to recoup it.

5550
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:36,870
Cross pollination and shit like that,

5551
02:31:36,871 --> 02:31:41,430
like the issues that they deal with with
farmers living in nearby communities

5552
02:31:41,431 --> 02:31:42,980
that don't have to.

5553
02:31:43,250 --> 02:31:44,083
I them.

5554
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:46,110
I'd say it's an issue becoming.

5555
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:49,050
I don't know how you fight the
inevitable rise of technology though.

5556
02:31:49,051 --> 02:31:50,310
You and I talk about it all the time.

5557
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:51,000
You can.

5558
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:51,151
I,

5559
02:31:51,151 --> 02:31:53,640
I just don't think that we're going to,

5560
02:31:54,120 --> 02:31:54,721
like I said,

5561
02:31:54,721 --> 02:31:57,840
I think that the crops have continued.

5562
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:01,350
Farmers from the beginning of time have
done everything they can to make their

5563
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:03,710
particular crop more nutritious,

5564
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:04,740
more calorie rich,

5565
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:05,371
more dense,

5566
02:32:05,371 --> 02:32:09,600
more energy efficient and also lasts
longer last longer and need less water.

5567
02:32:09,720 --> 02:32:11,820
Need less taste the sides all that.

5568
02:32:11,870 --> 02:32:12,180
Well,

5569
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:12,451
yeah.

5570
02:32:12,451 --> 02:32:13,290
I mean whatever we can,

5571
02:32:13,291 --> 02:32:13,681
whatever.

5572
02:32:13,681 --> 02:32:14,191
It doesn't matter.

5573
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:18,460
They just trying to engineer
and durability and who
knows like as far as like

5574
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:22,000
the vitamin content of one of those
payless tomatoes at the marketplace.

5575
02:32:22,030 --> 02:32:22,630
So like you,

5576
02:32:22,630 --> 02:32:22,931
you know,

5577
02:32:22,931 --> 02:32:25,830
the are people in the marketplace that
want a tomato that's going to taste good

5578
02:32:25,831 --> 02:32:26,190
as well.

5579
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:28,410
So there's an incentive to
create a good tasting tomato.

5580
02:32:28,440 --> 02:32:29,273
You know?

5581
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:31,050
Have you ever really had
a real tomato though?

5582
02:32:31,051 --> 02:32:31,591
Like a jersey.

5583
02:32:31,591 --> 02:32:32,850
They so good.

5584
02:32:33,660 --> 02:32:34,500
That's why it's a fruit.

5585
02:32:34,610 --> 02:32:38,040
Like when you went to La and you see
the fruits that are grown in manure than

5586
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:38,640
tomatoes.

5587
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:39,600
Forget it.

5588
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:42,860
That's why I eat organically
because I'm such a great.

5589
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:44,250
Even organically.

5590
02:32:44,251 --> 02:32:45,630
I mean the only thing that comes closest,

5591
02:32:45,650 --> 02:32:46,680
like heirloom tomatoes,

5592
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:48,180
you know what they say the best lamb is,

5593
02:32:48,181 --> 02:32:48,990
you know where it comes from?

5594
02:32:48,990 --> 02:32:50,130
Where Iraq.

5595
02:32:50,280 --> 02:32:50,910
Really?

5596
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:51,151
Yeah.

5597
02:32:51,151 --> 02:32:51,590
Iraq,

5598
02:32:51,590 --> 02:32:55,140
it they say is the sweetest tasting
land because they eat a certain kind of

5599
02:32:55,141 --> 02:32:56,850
grass there and it's,

5600
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:57,160
you know,

5601
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:58,230
it's Mesopotamia.

5602
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:00,570
They've been eaten goat and land
there from the beginning of time.

5603
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,810
You know?

5604
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:02,010
It's supposed to be insanely good.

5605
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:03,600
Yak Really?

5606
02:33:03,640 --> 02:33:04,560
Supposed to be delicious too.

5607
02:33:04,650 --> 02:33:05,483
Fattening.

5608
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:06,990
I bet it apparently.

5609
02:33:06,991 --> 02:33:07,430
What Ma,

5610
02:33:07,430 --> 02:33:09,390
what they eat to make it taste so good.

5611
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:13,050
Some moss that grows way the fuck up
there that you can't even grow down here,

5612
02:33:13,170 --> 02:33:14,940
so you can't make them in a farm.

5613
02:33:14,941 --> 02:33:17,010
You can't like make a yak farm
and have them eat this shit.

5614
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:18,070
Dirty animal,

5615
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:18,340
man.

5616
02:33:18,340 --> 02:33:19,290
They can go problem.

5617
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:20,550
They don't need sleeping bags.

5618
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:21,840
It's supposed to be delicious.

5619
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:22,530
Wow.

5620
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:23,363
Yak,

5621
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:24,503
Yak,

5622
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:25,180
Yak.

5623
02:33:25,180 --> 02:33:26,340
You'll eat the shit out of a Yak.

5624
02:33:26,420 --> 02:33:27,090
I will.

5625
02:33:27,090 --> 02:33:28,140
I'll jerk it too.

5626
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,080
I was watching Rinella show.

5627
02:33:31,081 --> 02:33:32,220
They went hunting for,

5628
02:33:32,221 --> 02:33:33,620
I think it's called a tarp.

5629
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:38,840
Some some fucking crazy looking at
wookie animal or something or some horn

5630
02:33:39,330 --> 02:33:40,050
wookie.

5631
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:40,470
Goat.

5632
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:42,810
Demon thing in New Zealand.

5633
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:43,921
It was nuts.

5634
02:33:43,921 --> 02:33:47,700
They were up in the middle of this fucking
like they have to cross this glacial

5635
02:33:47,701 --> 02:33:48,490
river.

5636
02:33:48,490 --> 02:33:50,760
We're a though the
runoff from the glacier.

5637
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:54,540
They had to shot an animal and the other
side so they had to cross it like what

5638
02:33:54,541 --> 02:33:57,330
we did is like a really
safe hunt for that guy.

5639
02:33:58,080 --> 02:33:58,550
Like he,

5640
02:33:58,550 --> 02:33:58,750
he,

5641
02:33:58,750 --> 02:34:00,660
he does some wild shit.

5642
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:02,970
Man Rinella.

5643
02:34:04,280 --> 02:34:05,440
Stabbing pigs.

5644
02:34:05,450 --> 02:34:07,560
Ed had a episode,

5645
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:12,060
the same place in New Zealand where they
hold the pigs down with a dog and then

5646
02:34:12,061 --> 02:34:13,440
they stab it with a knife to kill it.

5647
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:15,390
Do you want to know what
might the history on my phone,

5648
02:34:15,391 --> 02:34:16,300
my mobile phone as you want.

5649
02:34:16,390 --> 02:34:17,320
You want to to the district.

5650
02:34:17,470 --> 02:34:18,760
This is so fucking ridiculous.

5651
02:34:18,910 --> 02:34:20,200
It starts with ostrich.

5652
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:21,100
Chuck Taylors,

02:34:21,100 --> 02:34:21,933

Andy cause l comedian.

5671
02:34:40,571 --> 02:34:41,281
I want to know who he was.

5672
02:34:41,281 --> 02:34:42,040
I heard his name.

5673
02:34:42,040 --> 02:34:42,371
Cool.

5674
02:34:42,371 --> 02:34:45,880
T shirt design and best
breakfast in Fort Lauderdale.

5675
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:46,351
Yeah,

5676
02:34:46,351 --> 02:34:46,540
no.

5677
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:51,090
If you were working as a
ceo of an important company
and they found that the big

5678
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:51,641
white Dick,

5679
02:34:51,641 --> 02:34:52,031
they'd be like,

5680
02:34:52,031 --> 02:34:52,541
wait a minute,

5681
02:34:52,541 --> 02:34:53,374
what the fuck is this?

5682
02:34:53,490 --> 02:34:55,350
But I wanted to send a big
white Dick to a friend of mine.

5683
02:34:55,380 --> 02:34:56,213
I was like,

5684
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,430
hope you're having a great day.

5685
02:34:57,431 --> 02:34:59,410
And I just said that because I'm fucking.

5686
02:34:59,550 --> 02:35:00,160
I'm 12.

5687
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:02,800
You can't have that kind of sense of
humor if you work in corporate America.

5688
02:35:02,970 --> 02:35:03,803
No,

5689
02:35:03,850 --> 02:35:04,900
that's the thing to poisons.

5690
02:35:04,901 --> 02:35:05,381
Most people,

5691
02:35:05,381 --> 02:35:06,450
men suppression,

5692
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:09,310
daily suppression all
day having to fit a mold,

5693
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:13,890
work in some fucking stupid office
somewhere that's got to be life sapping.

5694
02:35:14,080 --> 02:35:15,460
I would agree.

5695
02:35:15,790 --> 02:35:19,690
The idea that one of the problems with
government is that there's no passion in

5696
02:35:19,790 --> 02:35:20,950
most levels of government.

5697
02:35:21,130 --> 02:35:22,180
They're just jobs,

5698
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:22,780
you know,

5699
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:25,480
and the real problem with jobs as people
want to get them and they want that

5700
02:35:25,481 --> 02:35:27,100
money and they want to keep
them and they never say,

5701
02:35:27,101 --> 02:35:27,491
you know what?

5702
02:35:27,491 --> 02:35:31,120
This job is just not really necessary
and that the way to best serve the

5703
02:35:31,121 --> 02:35:34,390
American people would be to
fucking get rid of this job,

5704
02:35:34,391 --> 02:35:35,320
but this is what I need.

5705
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:40,800
It becomes a personal issue that sort of
gets in the way of the greater good of

5706
02:35:40,841 --> 02:35:41,621
what you're trying to achieve.

5707
02:35:41,621 --> 02:35:43,130
You're not getting rid of a foot when you.

5708
02:35:43,150 --> 02:35:44,830
That's the problem with passing a law.

5709
02:35:45,130 --> 02:35:47,110
You're going to get a lot of
vested interests around that law.

5710
02:35:47,111 --> 02:35:49,690
You're not getting rid of that law
because then people lose their jobs.

5711
02:35:49,691 --> 02:35:50,320
Okay,

5712
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:51,640
so that's the other thing.

5713
02:35:51,641 --> 02:35:52,710
Remember when you pass a law,

5714
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:54,280
cottage industry grows up around it.

5715
02:35:54,281 --> 02:35:55,010
That's why.

5716
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:56,870
That's why Washington never gets rid of.

5717
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:57,820
Once they pass a law,

5718
02:35:57,821 --> 02:35:58,580
like the,

5719
02:35:58,580 --> 02:36:02,910
the anti marijuana laws you get,

5720
02:36:02,990 --> 02:36:06,220
you make illegal and you're going to
have a lot of people out of a job.

5721
02:36:06,221 --> 02:36:07,950
So yeah,

5722
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:12,960
there's a lot of money behind trying
to marijuana illegal and there was

5723
02:36:14,110 --> 02:36:15,350
something that I retweeted,

5724
02:36:15,720 --> 02:36:20,720
I think yesterday that was listing all
the different people that are involved in

5725
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,940
working hard to keep marijuana illegal.

5726
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,470
It's so annoying.

5727
02:36:26,920 --> 02:36:27,701
Read that Shit.

5728
02:36:27,701 --> 02:36:29,320
It just just makes you nuts.

5729
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:29,620
God.

5730
02:36:29,620 --> 02:36:30,131
Check this out.

5731
02:36:30,131 --> 02:36:33,310
There's already been a
voter machines going crazy.

5732
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:34,330
Look at this video.

5733
02:36:34,331 --> 02:36:39,331
It's switching people's votes from
Obama to seeing that switches it.

5734
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:43,060
I'm not surprised that they,

5735
02:36:43,061 --> 02:36:43,300
you know,

5736
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:44,440
they never fixed that shit.

5737
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,710
These fucking Republicans on
all these voting machines,

5738
02:36:47,970 --> 02:36:48,430
they,

5739
02:36:48,430 --> 02:36:52,870
they showed in that hacking democracy
documentary that you could fix them so

5740
02:36:52,871 --> 02:36:54,130
that they could change the vote.

5741
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:55,950
That's where it's ridiculous.

5742
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:56,950
Fucking scan.

5743
02:36:56,951 --> 02:36:58,300
This isn't a real life we're living.

5744
02:36:58,301 --> 02:36:59,170
It's all fake.

5745
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:03,100
We're living in a goddamn simulation.

5746
02:37:03,101 --> 02:37:05,170
Problem is you've got to kind of
care and you got to be informed.

5747
02:37:05,171 --> 02:37:07,780
Otherwise sources will take
your freedom away from it.

5748
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:09,890
If they're already taking
it with differences them.

5749
02:37:10,070 --> 02:37:11,560
You got to figure out a way to fight back,

5750
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:12,250
you know?

5751
02:37:12,250 --> 02:37:13,780
Have you seen these this way?

5752
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:15,123
Have you seen the,

5753
02:37:15,830 --> 02:37:20,360
the Chinese practice of eating eggs
boiled in the urine of young boys?

5754
02:37:20,361 --> 02:37:20,571
Sure.

5755
02:37:20,571 --> 02:37:21,110
Haven't.

5756
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:22,520
I sure haven't seen that.

5757
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:24,860
But please google that.

5758
02:37:26,990 --> 02:37:30,950
Chinese people eat eggs boiled
in the urine of Virgin Boys.

5759
02:37:30,951 --> 02:37:31,091
No,

5760
02:37:31,091 --> 02:37:33,110
he didn't look at this yesterday.

5761
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:34,970
I found that someone tweeted this out,

5762
02:37:35,070 --> 02:37:36,050
my twitter timeline,

5763
02:37:36,100 --> 02:37:37,030
pocus horseshoe.

5764
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:38,480
If you look at my twitter timeline,

5765
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:39,081
they,

5766
02:37:39,081 --> 02:37:39,261
uh,

5767
02:37:39,261 --> 02:37:39,650
they,

5768
02:37:39,650 --> 02:37:41,060
they have young boys,

5769
02:37:41,061 --> 02:37:45,840
they have them pee and then they
boil eggs in this young boy p and a.

5770
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:46,611
They eat it all day.

5771
02:37:46,611 --> 02:37:49,610
They say it keeps them healthy
and it's great for the skin.

5772
02:37:49,970 --> 02:37:51,080
It's like a super,

5773
02:37:51,081 --> 02:37:51,891
like common,

5774
02:37:51,891 --> 02:37:52,701
delicate shrink.

5775
02:37:52,701 --> 02:37:53,534
The actual urine.

5776
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:53,691
No,

5777
02:37:53,691 --> 02:37:56,630
they eat the eggs after it's
been boiled and little kid pis,

5778
02:37:56,840 --> 02:38:00,680
but it has to be like virgin boys I
guess once to start fucking becomes

5779
02:38:00,681 --> 02:38:01,514
problematic.

5780
02:38:01,550 --> 02:38:02,840
Do they boiled their hard,

5781
02:38:02,841 --> 02:38:06,290
boil it and they actually
crack the egg shell.

5782
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:09,020
So the urine seeps into the egg itself.

5783
02:38:09,260 --> 02:38:11,060
Not just heats it up from the outside,

5784
02:38:11,061 --> 02:38:16,061
seeps in and simmers for hours and hours
and piss would say post human beings 22

5785
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:18,554
hours ago.

5786
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:19,490
Humans are dumb.

5787
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:19,821
Hey,

5788
02:38:19,821 --> 02:38:20,670
do you have a guy?

5789
02:38:20,710 --> 02:38:21,270
You know,

5790
02:38:21,270 --> 02:38:22,280
I retweeted it.

5791
02:38:22,281 --> 02:38:25,310
A dude named Adrian frigidaire
refrigerator over there.

5792
02:38:26,390 --> 02:38:26,940
Don't get it.

5793
02:38:26,940 --> 02:38:30,280
We're going to wrap this up
soon and grabbed me one to um,

5794
02:38:30,350 --> 02:38:31,220
I don't think there's anything in there.

5795
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:31,940
Dude.

5796
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:34,380
There's nothing in your fridge up.

5797
02:38:34,640 --> 02:38:35,473
Mountain dew,

5798
02:38:35,960 --> 02:38:37,290
whatever it is in Cannes.

5799
02:38:38,480 --> 02:38:39,950
We should stop at Costco,

5800
02:38:39,980 --> 02:38:41,810
which is fucking stock this place full.

5801
02:38:42,020 --> 02:38:43,010
Want to go to Cosco letter?

5802
02:38:43,490 --> 02:38:44,301
I do all the time.

5803
02:38:44,301 --> 02:38:45,500
It just goes really fast.

5804
02:38:46,010 --> 02:38:46,251
Yeah,

5805
02:38:46,251 --> 02:38:49,100
but because you bring in slots in here
and they get thirsty sucking cock.

5806
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:51,290
So it's what it is.

5807
02:38:51,510 --> 02:38:52,343
That's what I heard.

5808
02:38:52,860 --> 02:38:53,590
So true.

5809
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:55,190
I'm not finding this
because you're retarded.

5810
02:38:55,210 --> 02:38:55,701
Come on dude.

5811
02:38:55,701 --> 02:38:56,510
Sitting there from.

5812
02:38:56,510 --> 02:38:57,230
I told you,

5813
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:57,980
retweet.

5814
02:38:57,980 --> 02:39:01,610
Retweet from a dude named
Adrian a fifth of November.

5815
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,340
I got 24 hours ago now.

5816
02:39:06,530 --> 02:39:07,363
Yeah.

5817
02:39:10,100 --> 02:39:14,240
What I love about you is that you
have used your influence for nothing,

5818
02:39:14,241 --> 02:39:14,841
but I'm sorry.

5819
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:15,591
It's Wilford Lee.

5820
02:39:15,591 --> 02:39:16,424
That's the guy's name.

5821
02:39:16,580 --> 02:39:17,400
Sorry.

5822
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:19,940
Wilford Lee is the guy tweeted
it to me on November fifth.

5823
02:39:20,090 --> 02:39:20,391
No,

5824
02:39:20,391 --> 02:39:21,440
it was 22 hours ago.

5825
02:39:21,441 --> 02:39:22,460
I was looking at something else.

5826
02:39:22,700 --> 02:39:22,970
Alright,

5827
02:39:22,970 --> 02:39:23,803
here we go.

5828
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,950
You see it?

5829
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:25,640
Yeah.

5830
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:26,180
Pull this up.

5831
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,890
This is going to be so ridiculous.

5832
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:28,550
So what we're saying,

5833
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:29,383
where were you thinking before?

5834
02:39:29,390 --> 02:39:30,380
I love that you have,

5835
02:39:30,470 --> 02:39:31,520
as your influence has grown,

5836
02:39:31,521 --> 02:39:31,780
you've,

5837
02:39:31,780 --> 02:39:34,640
you've done nothing but take care of
your friends and people around you and

5838
02:39:34,641 --> 02:39:35,810
trying to make the world a better place.

5839
02:39:35,930 --> 02:39:36,171
Well,

5840
02:39:36,171 --> 02:39:37,004
you know what?

5841
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:40,340
That world a better place thing
I'd done or know about that.

5842
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:40,821
Well,

5843
02:39:40,821 --> 02:39:41,080
no,

5844
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:44,030
you try to look at that.

5845
02:39:44,060 --> 02:39:44,241
Oh,

5846
02:39:44,241 --> 02:39:46,130
there we go and boil

5847
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:49,700
urine of young boys.

5848
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:51,890
Preferably those below the age of 10.

5849
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:55,180
Hence the name virgin boy eggs,

5850
02:39:56,130 --> 02:40:00,560
popular springtime snacking
touted for its health benefits.

5851
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:04,790
We have to be very careful about
going to war with these people.

5852
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:08,890
It's like somebody came up with
a gimmick to sell eggs and,

5853
02:40:09,080 --> 02:40:09,913
and uh,

5854
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:11,720
it's just a smart entrepreneur.

5855
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:14,070
Some guy in the corner 100,000 years ago,

5856
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:16,670
teaching them what's.

5857
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:19,520
It takes a full day to prepare the snacks,

5858
02:40:19,550 --> 02:40:22,670
starting off with collecting
urine from boys' toilets.

5859
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:27,500
Then the extra soaked and boiled in
pots of urine after which the shells are

5860
02:40:27,501 --> 02:40:31,400
cracked and the extra simmered
in the same urine for hours.

5861
02:40:32,300 --> 02:40:34,050
Those who snack on the exit,

5862
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:37,880
they helped decrease body heat and
promote better blood circulation.

5863
02:40:38,090 --> 02:40:40,340
That can make one feel reinvigorated.

5864
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:41,510
No.

5865
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:42,630
Well my God,

5866
02:40:43,380 --> 02:40:46,700
I already do this by eating.

5867
02:40:46,701 --> 02:40:51,680
These eggs will not have any
pain or waist legs and joints.

5868
02:40:52,340 --> 02:40:57,340
Also you'll have more energy when you do
work on what is the folks in Don young

5869
02:40:58,970 --> 02:40:59,960
are convinced.

5870
02:41:00,110 --> 02:41:04,760
What would you like eating these people
like it because they have this tradition

5871
02:41:04,761 --> 02:41:05,594
in Dong Yang.

5872
02:41:05,640 --> 02:41:08,690
Did these eggs and nourishment for our
health and that it would help prevent

5873
02:41:08,691 --> 02:41:09,860
things like getting a code.

5874
02:41:10,310 --> 02:41:11,840
I don't believe in this at all.

5875
02:41:12,110 --> 02:41:12,943
I don't eat.

5876
02:41:14,140 --> 02:41:18,730
Medical experts have mixed reviews about
the health benefits and some worn of

5877
02:41:18,740 --> 02:41:21,280
sanitary issues in this unique delicacy

5878
02:41:22,780 --> 02:41:24,220
in the doctor world.

5879
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:29,230
Declaring the virgin boy x as
an intangible cultural heritage.

5880
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:30,153
Huh?

5881
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:30,821
You know what's so funny?

5882
02:41:30,821 --> 02:41:32,440
This is probably a huge troll.

5883
02:41:33,310 --> 02:41:35,260
Like somebody put that
on your message board.

5884
02:41:35,370 --> 02:41:39,040
Like what if it's just
like the onion for China.

5885
02:41:39,330 --> 02:41:39,811
It could be,

5886
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:39,991
yeah,

5887
02:41:39,991 --> 02:41:42,990
they could have just had a picture of
simmering eggs and had a picture of the

5888
02:41:42,991 --> 02:41:44,920
stalls and pretended they pitched this.

5889
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:45,931
Go to Venice,

5890
02:41:45,931 --> 02:41:49,080
California right now and find a group
of people that are boiling eggs and

5891
02:41:49,081 --> 02:41:51,380
fucking young boy piss you think so.

5892
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:54,570
Our old man piss because
somebody came up with this idea.

5893
02:41:54,571 --> 02:41:55,350
Yeah.

5894
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:57,180
I think we've always boiled shit and piss

5895
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:00,690
and at the same reason,

5896
02:42:00,691 --> 02:42:00,961
you know,

5897
02:42:00,961 --> 02:42:02,330
you people would eat like,

5898
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:04,110
I don't like it.

5899
02:42:04,220 --> 02:42:08,460
They like why virgins are so prized as
your Chinese people do a lot of freaky

5900
02:42:08,461 --> 02:42:09,294
shit with eggs.

5901
02:42:09,360 --> 02:42:13,110
Like one of the things I'm
fearful or 100 year old eggs.

5902
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:14,940
Eggs.

5903
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:15,201
Yeah.

5904
02:42:15,201 --> 02:42:16,034
Baloo guys.

5905
02:42:18,230 --> 02:42:18,780
It's um,

5906
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:22,520
an egg that's like fermented and
black and it looks like Jelly.

5907
02:42:22,760 --> 02:42:23,090
Yeah.

5908
02:42:23,090 --> 02:42:25,260
We used to serve them to
people on fear factor.

5909
02:42:25,261 --> 02:42:26,220
Like it's disgusting,

5910
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:28,770
but they were like a
real delicacy in Chinese.

5911
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:30,120
When I was 14 years old,

5912
02:42:30,121 --> 02:42:31,260
back when China was comments,

5913
02:42:31,261 --> 02:42:32,100
I went to the mainland,

5914
02:42:32,101 --> 02:42:33,330
I spoke two weeks.

5915
02:42:33,410 --> 02:42:35,010
Their family.

5916
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,860
When you look at the bus,

5917
02:42:37,861 --> 02:42:38,551
all you saw,

5918
02:42:38,551 --> 02:42:38,851
I looked,

5919
02:42:38,851 --> 02:42:39,320
turned around.

5920
02:42:39,320 --> 02:42:43,740
I saw back then most people
in blue uniforms on bicycles,

5921
02:42:44,340 --> 02:42:46,400
Beijing was just one ballou.

5922
02:42:46,410 --> 02:42:47,243
See,

5923
02:42:48,370 --> 02:42:48,540
oh,

5924
02:42:48,540 --> 02:42:49,680
it was just a communist country.

5925
02:42:49,681 --> 02:42:51,360
Everybody wore the exact same blue outfit.

5926
02:42:51,970 --> 02:42:53,730
I wore a rode bicycles.

5927
02:42:53,770 --> 02:42:54,450
Was it freaky?

5928
02:42:54,450 --> 02:42:56,070
It was the freakiest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

5929
02:42:56,071 --> 02:42:56,904
No advertisements.

5930
02:42:56,910 --> 02:42:57,630
Think about that.

5931
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:58,141
No advertising,

5932
02:42:58,141 --> 02:42:58,681
no billboards,

5933
02:42:58,681 --> 02:42:59,520
no advertisements.

5934
02:42:59,610 --> 02:43:00,540
And Russia was the same way.

5935
02:43:00,541 --> 02:43:01,620
I went to Russia when it was communist.

5936
02:43:01,621 --> 02:43:02,210
There was no,

5937
02:43:02,210 --> 02:43:03,043
no advertising.

5938
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:04,320
So you go and you go,

5939
02:43:04,321 --> 02:43:05,670
why is everything so gray?

5940
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:06,181
Well,

5941
02:43:06,181 --> 02:43:07,110
there's no advertising.

5942
02:43:07,440 --> 02:43:08,041
There is no,

5943
02:43:08,041 --> 02:43:09,350
there is no color.

5944
02:43:09,360 --> 02:43:12,220
So you don't have people saying by this
that you weren't allowed to do that.

5945
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:13,690
Everything was run by the state.

5946
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:14,860
Uh,

5947
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:16,570
restaurants were these huge communal,

5948
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:19,120
sort of a huge communal affairs.

5949
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:20,260
So when you go to a restaurant,

5950
02:43:20,261 --> 02:43:21,340
do you have to pay anything?

5951
02:43:21,341 --> 02:43:22,041
Like how that were?

5952
02:43:22,041 --> 02:43:22,331
Very,

5953
02:43:22,331 --> 02:43:22,930
very little.

5954
02:43:22,930 --> 02:43:24,100
Everybody pays the same.

5955
02:43:24,670 --> 02:43:24,941
Right?

5956
02:43:24,941 --> 02:43:26,920
But when you pay like one beer,

5957
02:43:26,921 --> 02:43:28,150
that was one national beer,

5958
02:43:28,151 --> 02:43:28,901
there was one,

5959
02:43:28,901 --> 02:43:29,610
you know,

5960
02:43:29,610 --> 02:43:30,080
uh,

5961
02:43:30,080 --> 02:43:30,790
it was,

5962
02:43:30,790 --> 02:43:32,020
everything was so uniform.

5963
02:43:32,021 --> 02:43:33,610
I went to the pecan pagodas.

5964
02:43:33,611 --> 02:43:34,241
I went to the,

5965
02:43:34,241 --> 02:43:34,830
you know the,

5966
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:38,020
there are very few Buddhist shrines
that were really survived the communist

5967
02:43:38,021 --> 02:43:38,770
revolution.

5968
02:43:38,770 --> 02:43:39,850
Have you been back since?

5969
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:40,480
No,

5970
02:43:40,480 --> 02:43:40,871
no.

5971
02:43:40,871 --> 02:43:43,810
I mean chat Beijing now
is completely different,

5972
02:43:44,100 --> 02:43:44,561
but I went.

5973
02:43:44,561 --> 02:43:46,480
I was in Russia in 1985

5974
02:43:48,230 --> 02:43:48,990
in China.

5975
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:51,490
China has more billionaires
than anywhere else in the world.

5976
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:52,530
They buy buicks.

5977
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:53,110
Yeah.

5978
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:56,170
They really liked buicks and yet they
still have a very various oppressive

5979
02:43:56,200 --> 02:43:56,681
government,

5980
02:43:56,681 --> 02:43:57,200
but they,

5981
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:58,300
the Chinese have always.

5982
02:43:58,660 --> 02:44:03,460
The one thing that's that really is
really unique to China is that a huge area

5983
02:44:03,461 --> 02:44:04,600
of land speaks one language,

5984
02:44:04,601 --> 02:44:05,051
mandarin,

5985
02:44:05,051 --> 02:44:07,930
Chinese and that there's almost no
other example like that in the world.

5986
02:44:07,931 --> 02:44:08,764
However,

5987
02:44:08,890 --> 02:44:11,800
that's because the Yangtze
and the Yellow River,

5988
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:17,100
we're able to bring ideas and commerce
and language to all different parts of

5989
02:44:17,231 --> 02:44:21,380
China and so China became this
uniform powerhouses result of that.

5990
02:44:21,460 --> 02:44:24,280
What's more fascinating to me
is how they all look Chinese.

5991
02:44:24,940 --> 02:44:25,920
That's the credit.

5992
02:44:26,020 --> 02:44:27,820
That's the other thing that
you want to talk about,

5993
02:44:27,821 --> 02:44:29,440
like a really fast area,

5994
02:44:29,460 --> 02:44:31,510
a credible size place,

5995
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:34,990
and they all share a
very similar gene pool.

5996
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:38,290
I mean at least visually cause
of the anxiety and Yellow River,

5997
02:44:38,590 --> 02:44:41,320
there was so much trade knew
you were able to get in.

5998
02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:42,243
We were able to.

5999
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:43,300
Food production,

6000
02:44:43,301 --> 02:44:48,301
domestication of animals created huge
city centers and it concentrated a great

6001
02:44:48,551 --> 02:44:49,720
deal of people in one area.

6002
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:52,840
I love how when you see
northern Russia and Siberia,

6003
02:44:52,841 --> 02:44:54,400
it gets really Chinese looking.

6004
02:44:54,550 --> 02:44:55,061
While I was in.

6005
02:44:55,061 --> 02:45:00,010
I was focused on and if you talk to
people from Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan,

6006
02:45:00,280 --> 02:45:01,660
which are the areas that kind of like,

6007
02:45:01,661 --> 02:45:01,920
right.

6008
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:03,190
We're part of Russia used to be.

6009
02:45:03,400 --> 02:45:03,810
They're all,

6010
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:04,170
they're all,

6011
02:45:04,170 --> 02:45:04,961
they look very,

6012
02:45:04,961 --> 02:45:05,840
very high cheekbones,

6013
02:45:05,890 --> 02:45:06,730
very Asian.

6014
02:45:06,990 --> 02:45:08,170
They look more Mongol.

6015
02:45:08,410 --> 02:45:09,370
They're tall,

6016
02:45:09,550 --> 02:45:11,080
usually strong looking,

6017
02:45:11,110 --> 02:45:11,860
you know,

6018
02:45:11,860 --> 02:45:14,000
broad people with these high cheekbones.

6019
02:45:14,110 --> 02:45:15,370
If you see something like that,

6020
02:45:15,371 --> 02:45:17,800
doesn't it kind of like put
you in touch with history?

6021
02:45:17,980 --> 02:45:19,870
Like you start thinking
about like the gang is gone,

6022
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:21,070
Eric yourself out.

6023
02:45:21,071 --> 02:45:24,790
If you really want to freak out and you
want to see specimens of human beings,

6024
02:45:25,240 --> 02:45:26,710
go to the fucking Sudan,

6025
02:45:27,250 --> 02:45:30,220
go to Kenya and go take a
look at the Maasai warriors.

6026
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:31,390
Just go take a look.

6027
02:45:31,660 --> 02:45:35,230
If you want to know where the fuck guys
like Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan

6028
02:45:35,231 --> 02:45:36,064
come from,

6029
02:45:36,220 --> 02:45:36,611
I don't care.

6030
02:45:36,611 --> 02:45:37,770
To me it says they are the,

6031
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:39,010
they are these beautiful,

6032
02:45:39,011 --> 02:45:41,170
these fucking six foot seven,

6033
02:45:41,260 --> 02:45:43,240
seven foot people in the span.

6034
02:45:43,241 --> 02:45:43,481
These,

6035
02:45:43,481 --> 02:45:43,720
these,

6036
02:45:43,720 --> 02:45:44,050
these,

6037
02:45:44,050 --> 02:45:44,410
these,

6038
02:45:44,410 --> 02:45:45,820
they live a nomadic lifestyle.

6039
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:46,713
Seven feet,

6040
02:45:46,720 --> 02:45:47,553
no problem.

6041
02:45:48,310 --> 02:45:53,310
Athletic is all fucking get out wide
and big head's the size of basketballs.

6042
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,001
You're like,

6043
02:45:55,001 --> 02:45:56,410
where the fuck did you come from?

6044
02:45:56,680 --> 02:45:58,450
It is a different gene pool.

6045
02:45:58,510 --> 02:46:00,610
And how did that one gene pool rise?

6046
02:46:00,670 --> 02:46:01,420
How did the,

6047
02:46:01,420 --> 02:46:03,670
how did the pygmies in the Congo arise?

6048
02:46:03,780 --> 02:46:04,300
You know,

6049
02:46:04,300 --> 02:46:04,540
there,

6050
02:46:04,540 --> 02:46:05,170
there,

6051
02:46:05,170 --> 02:46:08,050
there are a lot of theories on
the biology of why people do it,

6052
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:10,830
but a lot of it had to do with um,

6053
02:46:11,050 --> 02:46:13,930
like how isolated that gene pool was at.

6054
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:14,391
For example,

6055
02:46:14,391 --> 02:46:15,410
Paul Pan Asian people,

6056
02:46:15,420 --> 02:46:17,840
very isolated for a long period of time.

6057
02:46:18,370 --> 02:46:19,030
Uh,

6058
02:46:19,030 --> 02:46:19,820
you know,

6059
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:20,501
Hawaii and,

6060
02:46:20,501 --> 02:46:20,701
and,

6061
02:46:20,701 --> 02:46:22,610
and especially Tonga and Samoa,

6062
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:23,570
I mean,

6063
02:46:23,570 --> 02:46:26,420
up until I think it was the late 17,

6064
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:27,590
early 18 hundreds,

6065
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:29,570
they'd never been
contacted by white people.

6066
02:46:29,870 --> 02:46:34,310
You know what's interesting about
islands is that animals tend to dwarf on

6067
02:46:34,311 --> 02:46:35,060
islands,

6068
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:37,940
but lizards tend to grow towards giant.

6069
02:46:37,941 --> 02:46:38,990
So yeah,

6070
02:46:38,991 --> 02:46:42,230
that's why the Komodo dragons
became like enormous lizard.

6071
02:46:42,231 --> 02:46:43,820
They were isolated to the Komodo islands,

6072
02:46:44,060 --> 02:46:46,220
but like pygmy elephants
and shit like that,

6073
02:46:46,440 --> 02:46:46,880
or they.

6074
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:47,370
Yeah,

6075
02:46:47,370 --> 02:46:48,400
in the sense that,

6076
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:48,740
yeah,

6077
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:49,820
the I'm not enough.

6078
02:46:49,880 --> 02:46:50,990
The hobbit people,

6079
02:46:50,991 --> 02:46:51,351
those,

6080
02:46:51,351 --> 02:46:52,790
a Homo Floresiensis,

6081
02:46:53,180 --> 02:46:55,730
those little tiny human beings
that lived alongside people.

6082
02:46:55,731 --> 02:46:58,670
That's also like an
episode of like an island.

6083
02:46:58,671 --> 02:46:59,420
Dwarfism.

6084
02:46:59,420 --> 02:46:59,991
I don't know.

6085
02:46:59,991 --> 02:47:00,291
Yeah,

6086
02:47:00,291 --> 02:47:01,700
I wonder though why,

6087
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:05,210
why was it a form of natural
selection where they grow so tall?

6088
02:47:05,211 --> 02:47:09,290
People like me because Sudans ridiculous
fight off lines and shit and the big

6089
02:47:09,291 --> 02:47:10,124
ones survived.

6090
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:15,520
And the Masai Mara are fucking tall
athletic that the Masa just broke the

6091
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:18,030
fucking half mile record
in the Olympics this year.

6092
02:47:18,050 --> 02:47:20,660
World record ran like fucking destroyed.

6093
02:47:20,661 --> 02:47:21,230
Everybody.

6094
02:47:21,230 --> 02:47:22,010
Well that guy,

6095
02:47:22,010 --> 02:47:22,371
you know,

6096
02:47:22,371 --> 02:47:22,920
comparing them.

6097
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:26,480
That's the conversation we were having
earlier with like some fucking fat Doughy

6098
02:47:26,481 --> 02:47:27,314
Guy,

6099
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:29,860
Gabriel Iglesias guy and you know,

6100
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:31,940
like physically if they're
going to get an MMA fight,

6101
02:47:31,941 --> 02:47:33,120
one of them is cheating already.

6102
02:47:33,150 --> 02:47:33,960
I got a shitty.

6103
02:47:33,960 --> 02:47:34,640
I got,

6104
02:47:34,640 --> 02:47:38,000
I didn't win the genetic
lottery and I'm okay to fail.

6105
02:47:38,030 --> 02:47:38,930
I didn't fail either.

6106
02:47:39,050 --> 02:47:39,651
I'm all right,

6107
02:47:39,651 --> 02:47:40,940
but when I look at fucking.

6108
02:47:41,990 --> 02:47:42,260
Yeah,

6109
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:43,093
I got to 70.

6110
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:46,400
You look at these fucking Simone's
with their back of their arms,

6111
02:47:46,401 --> 02:47:48,640
those big elbows and their knees.

6112
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:50,271
Mark Hunt,

6113
02:47:50,271 --> 02:47:51,104
looking legs,

6114
02:47:51,120 --> 02:47:51,953
command

6115
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:54,380
five minutes the.

6116
02:47:54,381 --> 02:47:55,640
Have you ever seen relentless enemies?

6117
02:47:55,900 --> 02:47:56,320
No.

6118
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:59,390
It's a documentary on
this one area of Africa.

6119
02:47:59,391 --> 02:48:00,380
We're a 100 years,

6120
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:04,720
no relentless enemy and this the lines,

6121
02:48:04,730 --> 02:48:05,630
the giant lines.

6122
02:48:05,900 --> 02:48:10,900
There's an area where the river changed
course 100 years ago and it's stranded

6123
02:48:11,451 --> 02:48:15,320
all these lions and water
buffalo in this one area,

6124
02:48:15,500 --> 02:48:19,550
and because the lines don't have any
other way other than water buffalo,

6125
02:48:19,730 --> 02:48:20,510
pull that up Brian.

6126
02:48:20,510 --> 02:48:22,070
Just pull up a video will end with this.

6127
02:48:22,340 --> 02:48:23,690
Blow your fucking socks off.

6128
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:25,550
They become hoke sized lines.

6129
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:28,140
The female lions are as
large as regular mail,

6130
02:48:28,260 --> 02:48:28,930
500 pound.

6131
02:48:28,930 --> 02:48:31,970
They're enormous muscular,

6132
02:48:32,120 --> 02:48:35,480
unbelievably muscular because
all they eat is water buffalo.

6133
02:48:35,660 --> 02:48:39,740
These giant fucking buffaloes that they
need like seven or eight of them to take

6134
02:48:39,741 --> 02:48:40,280
on,

6135
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:43,820
so they jump on their back and one of
them goes underneath and they try to drag

6136
02:48:43,821 --> 02:48:44,654
this thing down.

6137
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:49,960
The water buffaloes to search for a
relentless enemies lion versus water

6138
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:50,834
buffalo.

6139
02:48:50,990 --> 02:48:52,370
It's fucking incredible.

6140
02:48:52,371 --> 02:48:54,110
And they look like CGI lions.

6141
02:48:54,111 --> 02:48:55,010
They looked like the hulk,

6142
02:48:55,210 --> 02:48:56,900
like they have giant muscles.

6143
02:48:56,901 --> 02:48:57,950
I can't believe you don't know about this.

6144
02:48:57,970 --> 02:48:58,310
No.

6145
02:48:58,310 --> 02:48:59,400
How do I not know about this?

6146
02:48:59,401 --> 02:49:02,300
You're gonna Jack off to this
night is going to end your night.

6147
02:49:02,470 --> 02:49:02,651
Do you?

6148
02:49:02,651 --> 02:49:03,860
Have you seen the eye of the sparrow,

6149
02:49:03,861 --> 02:49:05,810
the bad lip sinking of
the presidential debate?

6150
02:49:06,050 --> 02:49:06,883
What does that.

6151
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:07,783
This.

6152
02:49:07,990 --> 02:49:08,520
You can't.

6153
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:08,940
You have to.

6154
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:10,200
We have to watch that before you take off.

6155
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:11,093
The

6156
02:49:12,370 --> 02:49:13,051
higher the speed,

6157
02:49:13,051 --> 02:49:15,780
you do relentless enemy's relentless.

6158
02:49:16,450 --> 02:49:17,460
Relentless enemies.

6159
02:49:19,960 --> 02:49:21,910
Did you just write whether Buffalo,

6160
02:49:21,940 --> 02:49:22,751
what the fuck did you?

6161
02:49:22,751 --> 02:49:23,584
Oh,

6162
02:49:23,770 --> 02:49:24,610
it's so hard to see.

6163
02:49:24,611 --> 02:49:25,444
It's so blurry.

6164
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:26,711
Why does it?

6165
02:49:26,711 --> 02:49:26,861
They,

6166
02:49:26,861 --> 02:49:27,110
they.

6167
02:49:27,110 --> 02:49:28,210
They can't make one of those things.

6168
02:49:28,211 --> 02:49:29,170
It looks like a monitor.

6169
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:31,380
What'd you say about water?

6170
02:49:31,390 --> 02:49:32,180
Buffalo?

6171
02:49:32,180 --> 02:49:34,570
Just relentless enemies.

6172
02:49:34,571 --> 02:49:34,960
That's it.

6173
02:49:34,960 --> 02:49:35,793
Click on that.

6174
02:49:36,550 --> 02:49:37,900
These fucking things.

6175
02:49:37,960 --> 02:49:39,820
You got wait till you
see what they look like.

6176
02:49:44,700 --> 02:49:46,290
I think this is the trailer for the movie.

6177
02:49:50,230 --> 02:49:51,063
What happened?

6178
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:52,750
Fucking windows.

6179
02:49:53,050 --> 02:49:53,770
That's cool.

6180
02:49:53,770 --> 02:49:54,400
That's good.

6181
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:55,240
Good resolution.

6182
02:49:57,810 --> 02:49:59,440
They bribed me to buy a flat screen TV.

6183
02:49:59,441 --> 02:50:00,021
We get this water.

6184
02:50:00,021 --> 02:50:01,490
Buffalo Jesus Christ.

6185
02:50:01,780 --> 02:50:03,320
Imagine having to eat that thing.

6186
02:50:03,560 --> 02:50:08,210
That's all you can eat and wait
till you sweat these fucking lions.

6187
02:50:08,211 --> 02:50:09,044
Dude,

6188
02:50:11,810 --> 02:50:13,450
is this over a course of 100 years,

6189
02:50:13,510 --> 02:50:17,140
so it's really changing the way they
look about how animals and tapped.

6190
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:17,500
Okay.

6191
02:50:17,500 --> 02:50:18,333
These things.

6192
02:50:18,980 --> 02:50:19,813
That's death.

6193
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,540
Look at the muscles on the way to use
the muscles in the fucking females,

6194
02:50:24,541 --> 02:50:26,630
man mean you never seen
anything like that.

6195
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:29,310
They're swimming out to
get this water buffalo.

6196
02:50:29,311 --> 02:50:29,800
They can't

6197
02:50:29,800 --> 02:50:30,633
look at that.

6198
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:33,230
All predators pray.

6199
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:35,193
Jeremy Irons.

6200
02:50:36,550 --> 02:50:38,530
We'll get the size of these fucking lines.

6201
02:50:38,550 --> 02:50:39,580
That's a smaller one.

6202
02:50:41,210 --> 02:50:43,670
Shit.

6203
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:50,460
Oh my God.

6204
02:50:52,980 --> 02:50:53,251
This.

6205
02:50:53,251 --> 02:50:54,084
Kiss me.

6206
02:50:55,050 --> 02:50:55,591
What are you doing,

6207
02:50:55,591 --> 02:50:56,424
Brian?

6208
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:57,960
Subtler bitch.

6209
02:50:59,150 --> 02:51:00,600
Look at how they have
to fight these things.

6210
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:05,213
There's several.

6211
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:06,441
There's several.

6212
02:51:06,441 --> 02:51:06,480
Several

6213
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:10,140
different prides on this island
and not all of them are oversized.

6214
02:51:10,141 --> 02:51:10,681
It's interesting.

6215
02:51:10,681 --> 02:51:12,310
If we saw that some of
them are regular sized.

6216
02:51:12,460 --> 02:51:14,910
Can I see that relentless
enemies get it on Netflix.

6217
02:51:14,911 --> 02:51:15,451
I'm sure.

6218
02:51:15,451 --> 02:51:16,950
I'm sure it's available on Amazon.

6219
02:51:16,951 --> 02:51:17,371
Go Buy.

6220
02:51:17,371 --> 02:51:20,160
Go to [inaudible] dot com
and buy it from there.

6221
02:51:20,161 --> 02:51:20,994
And Brian makes money.

6222
02:51:21,730 --> 02:51:22,563
We use

6223
02:51:23,910 --> 02:51:27,010
quickly so I can show Joe just sparrow.

6224
02:51:27,130 --> 02:51:29,010
Podcast is almost over time.

6225
02:51:29,250 --> 02:51:30,600
We turn into a pumpkin and two minutes,

6226
02:51:30,601 --> 02:51:31,434
two seconds.

6227
02:51:32,170 --> 02:51:33,630
Come see me at helium Gemelli.

6228
02:51:33,870 --> 02:51:38,190
Go see him or come see me and joey ideas
in San Diego at the elbow with theater.

6229
02:51:38,260 --> 02:51:38,700
Boom.

6230
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:39,533
Hold on.

6231
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:41,160
Saturday night.

6232
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:41,970
This Saturday night.

6233
02:51:41,970 --> 02:51:42,410
Oh Man,

6234
02:51:42,410 --> 02:51:43,980
I'm in fucking dead punch.

6235
02:51:43,981 --> 02:51:44,701
Ladies and gentlemen,

6236
02:51:44,701 --> 02:51:45,511
you're on the east coast.

6237
02:51:45,511 --> 02:51:48,070
Come see me and helium and I'll
tell you all about joe wrote.

6238
02:51:48,071 --> 02:51:49,800
I got loose in San Francisco,

6239
02:51:50,010 --> 02:51:53,050
knocked the Dixon to the
dirt and Seattle spirit.

6240
02:51:53,740 --> 02:51:54,630
Eyes of the sparrow.

6241
02:51:54,830 --> 02:51:56,340
Can I have the sparrow?

6242
02:51:56,350 --> 02:51:56,731
Seattle.

6243
02:51:56,731 --> 02:51:58,350
So fun that Seattle's great.

6244
02:51:58,351 --> 02:52:00,720
So you just didn't see how I just did.

6245
02:52:00,721 --> 02:52:01,980
The more smart people,

6246
02:52:01,981 --> 02:52:03,720
they get it and love it.

6247
02:52:03,810 --> 02:52:04,643
I love it.

6248
02:52:04,730 --> 02:52:06,010
It's just dreary as fuck

6249
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:06,700
up there,

6250
02:52:06,700 --> 02:52:08,380
but they enjoy the shit out of a show.

6251
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:09,850
So dreary though.

6252
02:52:09,880 --> 02:52:10,661
Sos Canada.

6253
02:52:10,661 --> 02:52:11,030
But if they,

6254
02:52:11,030 --> 02:52:12,400
they're the greatest audiences.

6255
02:52:12,460 --> 02:52:15,930
Vancouver's not as dreary
scooper and can't wait.

6256
02:52:15,940 --> 02:52:16,751
What are you doing in Vancouver?

6257
02:52:16,751 --> 02:52:17,584
You do theaters.

6258
02:52:17,950 --> 02:52:18,761
I love Vancouver.

6259
02:52:18,761 --> 02:52:19,211
What are you going to do?

6260
02:52:19,211 --> 02:52:19,830
Comedy Mix.

6261
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:21,610
I'm going to do comedy
and that place is great.

6262
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,290
Duncan trussell just sold that out.

6263
02:52:23,291 --> 02:52:26,560
We tweeted about it and he sold it out
in one day so that the whole weekend.

6264
02:52:26,561 --> 02:52:27,310
It's great.

6265
02:52:27,310 --> 02:52:28,190
What are we watching here?

6266
02:52:28,940 --> 02:52:29,250
No,

6267
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:29,440
no,

6268
02:52:29,440 --> 02:52:29,590
no,

6269
02:52:29,590 --> 02:52:29,761
no,

6270
02:52:29,761 --> 02:52:29,961
no,

6271
02:52:29,961 --> 02:52:30,400
no,

6272
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:30,581
no,

6273
02:52:30,581 --> 02:52:30,860
no.

6274
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:31,161
What do you.

6275
02:52:31,161 --> 02:52:32,480
Don't let him Google on its own.

6276
02:52:32,481 --> 02:52:33,111
You've got to tell him.

6277
02:52:33,111 --> 02:52:36,620
What the fuck are you going
to see a castle sparrow.

6278
02:52:36,940 --> 02:52:37,773
Bad.

6279
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:40,260
Bad lip sinking that lives there.

6280
02:52:40,261 --> 02:52:40,790
They're right there.

6281
02:52:40,790 --> 02:52:41,780
The second one,

6282
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:42,790
watch this.

6283
02:52:42,790 --> 02:52:43,623
Wash that say,

6284
02:52:43,660 --> 02:52:44,800
this is so fucking funny.

6285
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:45,960
We were watching this.

6286
02:52:45,960 --> 02:52:46,350
This is.

6287
02:52:46,350 --> 02:52:47,100
This is.

6288
02:52:47,100 --> 02:52:47,933
This is.

6289
02:52:47,950 --> 02:52:49,140
This is the president's debate,

6290
02:52:49,150 --> 02:52:49,720
and they they,

6291
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:52,720
they redubbed their voices because they
walked their mouths and they could be

6292
02:52:52,721 --> 02:52:53,554
saying something else.

6293
02:52:53,920 --> 02:52:54,521
Watch this.

6294
02:52:54,521 --> 02:52:55,354
This is so wild

6295
02:52:57,790 --> 02:52:58,620
on.

6296
02:52:58,620 --> 02:52:59,500
This is the one.

6297
02:53:01,940 --> 02:53:02,120
No,

6298
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:02,751
the hot tub.

6299
02:53:02,751 --> 02:53:05,310
It's cool now poisoning.

6300
02:53:05,390 --> 02:53:05,961
I know,

6301
02:53:05,961 --> 02:53:06,580
right?

6302
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:07,413
I know.

6303
02:53:07,500 --> 02:53:09,120
Sing me some harmonies.

6304
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:14,220
It's a small picture in a shop
somewhere and I know who it is.

6305
02:53:14,310 --> 02:53:15,121
It's Mormon,

6306
02:53:15,121 --> 02:53:17,330
judy and cow people.

6307
02:53:17,370 --> 02:53:20,220
Little pitchy but good stuff.

6308
02:53:20,910 --> 02:53:21,960
Governor Romney's black.

6309
02:53:23,310 --> 02:53:25,140
I think black can be judged.

6310
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:26,220
How do I do this?

6311
02:53:26,580 --> 02:53:26,911
Dude?

6312
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:28,170
I don't have a jet ski.

6313
02:53:28,260 --> 02:53:29,790
Not the kind you're talking about.

6314
02:53:30,170 --> 02:53:32,610
Plus everyone can see that I'm not black.

6315
02:53:33,210 --> 02:53:35,260
You have to enjoy the civic stuff.

6316
02:53:36,330 --> 02:53:38,130
These guys to laugh at this.

6317
02:53:38,131 --> 02:53:38,431
I mean,

6318
02:53:38,431 --> 02:53:41,160
I do want you to support me and be my man.

6319
02:53:41,700 --> 02:53:42,600
That's beautiful.

6320
02:53:42,930 --> 02:53:43,860
I know he's black.

6321
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:45,600
Ahmed,

6322
02:53:45,600 --> 02:53:48,800
how did you know about
who done it in the lounge?

6323
02:53:49,670 --> 02:53:50,170
Didn't know.

6324
02:53:50,170 --> 02:53:50,291
Well,

6325
02:53:50,291 --> 02:53:55,291
you didn't study clapping for the
mad cow until someone sold him.

6326
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:57,570
Who is that creepy old

6327
02:53:59,120 --> 02:53:59,953
debates?

6328
02:54:00,180 --> 02:54:01,710
Boy Stuff.

6329
02:54:02,830 --> 02:54:04,090
That dude's the sickest.

6330
02:54:04,210 --> 02:54:07,300
We hate him because he
had eggs for a bath.

6331
02:54:07,440 --> 02:54:08,770
I'm gonna throw up tonight,

6332
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:13,750
but if you throw up and
it's as a jealous on that,

6333
02:54:16,520 --> 02:54:19,390
you have to see this stupid.

6334
02:54:19,690 --> 02:54:20,830
Governor Romney won't do that.

6335
02:54:20,831 --> 02:54:21,220
Okay.

6336
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:22,540
Audio is not doing.

6337
02:54:22,541 --> 02:54:22,661
This.

6338
02:54:22,661 --> 02:54:23,800
Just got me thinking.

6339
02:54:25,560 --> 02:54:30,560
I see a purple idiot speaks German with
a big spunky Irish labradoodle puppy.

6340
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:31,561
Oh,

6341
02:54:31,561 --> 02:54:36,260
he got me and I want you to
feel bad because I've got
funny radiation coming up.

6342
02:54:36,261 --> 02:54:36,540
I'm like,

6343
02:54:36,540 --> 02:54:36,991
come on,

6344
02:54:36,991 --> 02:54:37,890
I'm not a robot.

6345
02:54:37,891 --> 02:54:38,610
Okay.

6346
02:54:38,610 --> 02:54:43,080
I wish I could go higher and you could
rotate my arm and send me wishing into

6347
02:54:43,081 --> 02:54:43,914
space.

6348
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:45,180
Hear me on that

6349
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:48,170
shot is so fucking cool.

6350
02:54:48,440 --> 02:54:49,273
Right off.

6351
02:54:49,610 --> 02:54:50,443
17.

6352
02:54:50,750 --> 02:54:51,360
Stupid.

6353
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:52,380
You got to see it firsthand.

6354
02:54:52,430 --> 02:54:54,030
When is it over folks?

6355
02:54:54,031 --> 02:54:55,080
Who the fuck is the price?

6356
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:56,250
This is election day.

6357
02:54:56,251 --> 02:54:57,031
Two thousand 12.

6358
02:54:57,031 --> 02:54:57,864
Ladies and gentlemen.

6359
02:54:57,930 --> 02:55:00,060
Vote a month before the apocalypse.

6360
02:55:00,360 --> 02:55:01,193
Right now.

6361
02:55:01,520 --> 02:55:02,353
Whoa.

6362
02:55:02,690 --> 02:55:03,050
You Ready?

6363
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:03,883
This what?

6364
02:55:03,940 --> 02:55:04,730
I'm

6365
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:07,580
Mitt Romney's in the lead right now.

6366
02:55:07,581 --> 02:55:10,730
He has 152 electoral
votes to 23 for Obama.

6367
02:55:11,120 --> 02:55:15,170
Obama has a 48 percent

People were just going to watch
