1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
The tuna,
it keeps getting bigger.

2
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,500
Married.
His hips are this wife.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,450
Oh,
I hate to tell you.

4
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:04,740
You're 35.
You guys are like,

5
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,090
oh,
it's awful.

6
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,830
You guys are alive right now.
Don't say anything.

7
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:10,390
Fucked up.
This episode.

8
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,310
We're talking about Brian's cousin.
Great for you.

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Don't tell him.
Don't say anything fucked up by your 

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:18,500
cousin.
He's.

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:18,500
He's just a kid.
Jesus.

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,250
I though I will.
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience

13
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:21,740
is brought to you.
Buy naturebox.

14
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,930
Brian,
have you ever had delicious and 

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:26,930
nutritious nature,
but not only that,

16
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:27,320
they sponsor the 10 minute podcast.
Sure.

17
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,610
Box.
It's actually pretty good.

18
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,570
It's great.
I,

19
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,580
I order you can order.
What I like about naturebox is that you 

20
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,840
can order a specific stuff,
like I have them send me all gluten free

21
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,170
stuff,
so I got like the Serratia cashews.

22
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,790
Oh,
they're devastating.

23
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,820
And then there's almonds.
These blueberry almonds.

24
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,860
Holy Shit.
And they're fucking guilt free.

25
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,830
There's a lot of stuff that you can get 
that you know,

26
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:52,920
it's more like pretzely stuff that 
probably isn't the best for you,

27
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,580
but what they always have is no 
hydrogenated oils,

28
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,850
no artificial colors,
no artificial flavors,

29
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,440
no artificial preservatives,
no transfats,

30
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,700
no transfats,
and it's really healthy stuff as far as 

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,570
snacks go and depending on how you 
choose,

32
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,020
you can get it very healthy.
Big Island pineapples.

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,790
Another great one I love.
It's their dried pineapple.

34
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,160
That's it.
It's just slices of delicious,

35
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,620
dried pineapple,
basically guilt free,

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,210
delicious,
awesome stuff.

37
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,000
And uh,
they also,

38
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:29,001
they'll ship anywhere,
free shipping anywhere in the United 

39
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:29,001
States.
A naturebox is a,

40
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:33,470
just a great alternative to like if 
you're working in an office and you 

41
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,250
don't want to be forced to deal with the
vending machine food,

42
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,720
it's not that expensive either.
I think you can get,

43
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:41,721
like,
you can get 20 bags for 40 bucks or 

44
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:41,721
something or whatever it is.

45
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,630
You can get 50 percent off your first 
box by going to naturebox.com

46
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,810
forward slash rogen.
That's naturebox.com

47
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:54,050
forward slash rogen.
They also have these chocolate almond 

48
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,410
things are just fucking deadly.
I ate them all.

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,250
I eat everything.
I have a new package that just came.

50
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,120
I just get the ethos.
Those are naturebox.

51
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,930
Naturebox.com/Rogan.
Go there and save 50 percent off your 

52
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,610
first box.
We're also brought to you by legalzoom.

53
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,680
Legalzoom is a way of handling all sorts
of things online that you would normally

54
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:21,681
have to go to a law office and meet with
a lawyer and pay a fuck load of money.

55
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,600
Most likely.
Instead you could do it at home,

56
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,630
drunk and naked.
You can be having sex and you could do 

57
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,541
it with a laptop.
You could be giving head if you're so 

58
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,540
inclined.
You could give head and then come up for

59
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,670
air every now and then and fill out some
forms.

60
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,760
I heard about legal zoom after they 
sponsored my podcasts and I,

61
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,680
but way too late because I set up an 
LLC.

62
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:45,681
It costs me $1,300
where you could have done it for like 

63
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:45,681
100 bucks,
100 bucks.

64
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:47,360
I mean you can do it for 99 bucks.
You can set it,

65
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:50,520
you can incorporate or set up an llc for
99 bucks.

66
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,550
Someone told me you could do that free 
online or that is like a bunch of steps 

67
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:58,800
that you have to go through.
Legal Zoom makes it way more convenient.

68
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:00,820
It's just a hundred bucks.
Fucking Weirdos.

69
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,920
I get it.
I get it.

70
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:07,921
It's a lot of money,
but it's way better than going to a a 

71
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:07,921
law office.
Also.

72
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,310
I'll law and by the way,
I don't think that's.

73
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,230
I don't think it's true.
I don't think you can do it for free.

74
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,880
I think you have to do a bunch of 
different things.

75
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,470
The way legal zoom has it set up.
It's way easier.

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,070
Fortunate they got,
first of all,

77
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,860
they got an a plus from the better 
business bureau.

78
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,560
I love Shit like that so you don't have 
to worry about it.

79
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:25,480
Plus I know a bunch of dudes,
Aubrey,

80
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,860
um,
formed on it,

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,100
the first llc for on it.
That was all done through legalzoom.

82
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,070
Brian,
when incorporated desk won,

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
that was done through legal zoom.
Not Add 10 customers would recommend 

84
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
legalzoom after they used it.
But you know what that means,

85
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,550
that means it's awesome because we all 
know one of 10 people are just whiny 

86
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,830
cunt.
That's complained about everything.

87
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,230
So if you get nine out of 10,
that's beautiful.

88
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,220
If you really can make 90 percent.
Everybody on the Internet loves to,

89
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,710
loves to find anything to talk anything.
God.

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,820
If the aliens come and read our youtube 
comments,

91
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:58,020
they're going to get right back in there
fucking spaceship and fly away like this

92
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,840
is just tough.

93
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,090
Called sucks is a cauldron of cunt.
Anyway,

94
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:06,810
with legal zoom,
you can get a last will for 69 bucks.

95
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,210
But.
And also they can provide you with the 

96
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,390
third party attorney if you panic.
That's a big one.

97
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,900
So if you're in the middle of filling 
all this stuff,

98
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:15,670
it was like,
oh yeah,

99
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,610
if I can do it,
they can hook you up with an independent

100
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:22,440
attorney so someone can figure it out 
for you.

101
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,250
Cool.
Yeah.

102
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,350
Legalzoom is not a law firm,
but they can connect you with a third 

103
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,550
party attorney and provide you with self
help services.

104
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,660
Anyway.
Go there.

105
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,930
Use the Codeword Rogan in the referral 
box at checkout and save yourself some 

106
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,510
cash son.
Get it all together.

107
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,400
Bitch.
Last well for $69.

108
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:44,401
That's so depressing.
It's all the pressing death is 

109
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:44,401
depressing,
but yet inevitable.

110
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:49,010
And so the stunt,
the sun itself has a billion years left 

111
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:49,010
and then we're fucked anyway.

112
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,240
Whatever,
whatever on it.com.

113
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,340
Oh,
and it,

114
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,610
if you've never have you used any of the
onnit shit and we sent you anything.

115
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,790
I don't know.
My primal bell.

116
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,410
Give me an address.
I'll have it all sent to you.

117
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,610
Men.
Men.

118
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,450
Yeah,
please.

119
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,210
Give me the dress.
We have this new things,

120
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,260
warrior bars there.
Um,

121
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,330
by the same people that made the Tonka 
Bar,

122
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:11,350
which is a native American recipe of 
without any preservatives whatsoever.

123
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:16,351
Mixing cranberries and buffalo meat.
Each one of them has 14 grams of 

124
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:18,220
protein.
It's no nitrates,

125
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,190
no artificial flavors,
no antibiotics,

126
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,950
no nonsense.
I'll be honest with four grams of fat.

127
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,240
I hate it.
And it was so good.

128
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,950
It's fucking delicious.
I gotta be honest.

129
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,630
I feel like I'm in the Truman show right
now.

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Was that?
Have you ever seen that with Jim k 

131
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,520
product placement,
but this isn't product place with him 

132
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:35,520
and you guys love this stuff.

133
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,300
It's fucking delicious.
What was the.

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,820
What happened in the Truman show with 
product?

135
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,620
The Truman show where the whole world's 
watching Jim Carrey.

136
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,770
Yeah.
That's what the one where he is.

137
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,480
She's like,
try the nestle.

138
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:51,481
Quik.
It's delicious and refreshing and he's 

139
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:51,481
like,
all right,

140
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:51,481
matt it to the store.
Well that was like,

141
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,080
he didn't know.
Right?

142
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,480
He had no idea that he was the show 
since.

143
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,410
Since a baby.
I didn't see that.

144
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,600
It's a mind for man.
It's a mind.

145
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:04,601
Fuck.
You remember that Matthew mcconaughey 

146
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,431
show?
It was a movie where they followed him 

147
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,981
around with a camera and he became 
really famous and we became like this 

148
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:08,981
huge disaster.
It was called.

149
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,370
Was it called?
What?

150
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,900
It was called MTV,
MTV,

151
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,080
MTV.
That standard operational procedure on 

152
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,550
reality shows now like those are real 
and I watch every one of them.

153
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
This was before any of that.

154
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,060
Tell them your favorite show.
I mean,

155
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:24,800
I don't know where to begin.
Naked.

156
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,590
Love naked and afraid.
Let me just get through this audit thing

157
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,880
real quick.
Sorry.

158
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:29,960
I'll send you some shit,
man.

159
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,990
I'll send you some shit.
I'll send you a and I'll send you some 

160
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,750
primal belts with the bulletproof coffee
because I make it myself.

161
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,050
You know what I'm saying?
Yourself and that's what I've been 

162
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,050
doing.
What do you.

163
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,050
What do you mean,
like hookup with what?

164
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,440
With the kind of coffee?
Yes.

165
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,420
See we found out this is a.
We actually talked about the fungus came

166
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,360
out some bullshit.
Yeah.

167
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,750
Well this is the deal.
All right.

168
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,640
I don't know.
I can never.

169
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:57,641
I don't.
I don't want to speculate anybody's 

170
00:06:57,641 --> 00:06:59,141
intention.
So what I'll just tell you is the 

171
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:00,941
absolute facts.
There have been cases where mycotoxins 

172
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,270
became an issue with coffee.

173
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,740
Those cases,
most of them have been resolved by going

174
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:11,741
through these mycotoxin issues and then 
rigorous testing and then figuring out 

175
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,671
ways to not provide an environment where
mycotoxins are toxins and hopefully 

176
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,870
heard that and took it and ran with it.
Good for you.

177
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,710
Here's the issue here,
but he stopped.

178
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,420
He brought me.
Unfortunately,

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,450
he brought me in,
unfortunately me because he was,

180
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,490
you know,
saying it on my podcast and I repeated 

181
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,821
it without any research.
It used to be an issue and it can be an 

182
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,290
issue still if someone is not preparing 
coffee correctly,

183
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,380
but it's like when you buy really good 
coffee,

184
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:42,740
like there's a company called Rusty's 
Hawaiian delicious,

185
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:47,741
delicious coffee.
Their bags are rated by like coffee 

186
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:50,831
connoisseur,
sores were professional coffee graders 

187
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:53,920
that will taste the coffee and check out
various various beans and different 

188
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,870
roasts and then they grade it,
but they also tested for mycotoxins.

189
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,440
Like if you have fungus in your fucking 
coffee,

190
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,220
you get a really low score.
Fungus on my roast.

191
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,070
They figured out a long time ago.
First of all,

192
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:12,071
this is where it gets really weird.
That coffee was originally established 

193
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:15,461
in Ethiopia,
which is a dry climate and all these 

194
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,210
mycotoxin issues happened when they 
started moving them out at Ethiopia,

195
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,070
put them in other places where there's 
moisture.

196
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:19,880
Yeah,
exactly.

197
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,620
Growing them in different places.
In California,

198
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:25,910
wines have very few microtoxins,
especially Okra toxin a,

199
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,190
which is the big one because it's so 
dry,

200
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,620
so they actually have very,
very little of that.

201
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,600
A very little issues with that.
Yeah.

202
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,460
Isn't that interesting?
And corn as well.

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,750
Corn,
you know there's.

204
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,740
There's a bunch of different mycotoxins.
That's the point.

205
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,190
If you buy really good coffee,
which is most of you,

206
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,220
what you buy,
most likely you're not gonna have any 

207
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,220
issues whatsoever.

208
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,330
If you do have issues.
According to Dr Rhonda Patrick,

209
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,750
she was saying that even like above 
threshold doses of these mycotoxins even

210
00:08:55,801 --> 00:09:00,801
provide a beneficial reaction by your 
body that your body reacting to these 

211
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:05,430
mycotoxins that aren't necessarily like 
really bad for you in small doses,

212
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,610
that your body might actually energize 
it's immune system in response so it 

213
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,120
might have some sort of a corresponding 
positive effect.

214
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,280
This is obviously layman's terms.
I'm a retard.

215
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,600
I don't really even know what I just 
said.

216
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,420
According to her,
these things make sense.

217
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,930
So what I'm saying is you can make that 
style of coffee like coffee with grass 

218
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,431
fed butter and mct oil.
You can make that with almost any good 

219
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:31,400
and you're blending it or you're just.
You're just stuff that you're drinking 

220
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,400
right here.
Is that delicious?

221
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,670
I don't ever plan.
I just.

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
Black coffee scoop of butter.

223
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,150
That's cool to t and start.
That's fine too.

224
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:41,151
I mean it's a little more.
A little Stevia can use the packets 

225
00:09:41,151 --> 00:09:41,220
though.
This bottle.

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,500
Oh yeah.
A little too much in Jack.

227
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,410
You if you only let,
like a mist of Stevia is a plant extract

228
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,760
zero.
Zero sugar.

229
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,210
You don't have to worry about it.
No,

230
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,570
not at all.
I mean,

231
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,230
it's probably like all things not great 
if you ate it all day,

232
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,670
you know,
even plants,

233
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,100
I eat it all day.
I feel great.

234
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,710
Nine plants.
Our plants are toxic.

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I mean quite a lot of their own tie.
They keep people from eating them 

236
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,290
discouraged when people are like juicing
lots and lots of leafy Greens.

237
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,570
We'll do that.
We'll do that again.

238
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,520
About the rest of the commercial was 
just keep going.

239
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,140
We don't have to play music.
Fuck it.

240
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,590
Just.
I liked throwing one out like that over 

241
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,590
on a.com.

242
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,590
Use the code word.
Rogan saves money.

243
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,340
Yep.
Yeah.

244
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,020
Um,
so this is the point is that this,

245
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,050
this,
these toxins may or may not be an issue 

246
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,980
in some coffee today.
They were at one point in time,

247
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,350
but the coffee experts aren't worried 
about that.

248
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,410
When you talked to coffee experts,
they're all worried about taste and 

249
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,440
flavor and where they're grown and 
they're also worried about the fact that

250
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:45,441
the climate in Ethiopia apparently is 
deteriorating because of global warming 

251
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:49,850
and they think within the next 50 years,
like a good percentage of the species 

252
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,360
that only exists in Ethiopia will be 
extinct.

253
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,350
Wow.
Yeah.

254
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,770
Because there's all of the coffee in the
world comes from Ethiopia.

255
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:58,200
Originally my brother told me about this
and I was like,

256
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:03,201
Hey,
you realize in 50 years coffee is going 

257
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:03,480
to be no longer freaked out.
I freaked out.

258
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,860
Well,
will start storing comp.

259
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,450
It'll be in Latin America,
Costa Rica.

260
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,460
Right.
That doesn't also matter like when you 

261
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,021
roast them versus when you drink.
That's another thing that issue that 

262
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:18,021
people have with this,
uh,

263
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:18,360
upgraded coffee.
Although it's,

264
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:23,361
you know,
he's very successful at sells very well 

265
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:23,361
for whatever reasons.
Um,

266
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,070
so it's hard to keep on the shelf so 
it's constantly moving.

267
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,930
So you're getting fresh coffee when you 
buying it.

268
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,660
Caveman coffee roasts it when you order 
it,

269
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,150
if you order caveman coffee when you're 
playing right?

270
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,730
Tate Fletcher and really good coffee and
tested mycotoxin free 100 percent.

271
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,200
They tested it.
They went through.

272
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,780
They're getting everything single source
from a grower.

273
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:47,781
They know the guy,
the guy's family lives in South America 

274
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:51,590
and he lives in Albuquerque,
so they traveled back and forth to the 

275
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,590
farm.
They know exactly where it comes from.

276
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,040
It's as legit single source is.
You can get keith

277
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,650
guardians a bad ass coffee,
sweetie.

278
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,650
He's just a great guy and he was a hell 
of a fighter,

279
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,120
you know,
and he still wants to go out and again,

280
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:06,121
he's thinking one more time,
one more time for Albuquerque when 

281
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,121
they're trained with them for a long 
time.

282
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,121
Right on time.
Yeah.

283
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,360
Really good friend.
He's an awesome guy.

284
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,450
Just couldn't be a cooler guy and he's 
doing really well with this.

285
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,700
This caveman coffee company.
It's just they,

286
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,270
uh,
you know,

287
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:18,271
him and tate are big coffee,
banana and coffee take never goes 

288
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,870
anywhere without a fucking container of 
coffee.

289
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,030
Like everyone else carries a thermos of 
coffee.

290
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,080
He loves it.
Always has.

291
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:25,570
Ever since I've known him,
I had a guy on my podcast,

292
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,100
a what the hell?
I can't remember.

293
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,880
Sorry.
Hey,

294
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,470
he wrote a book called what?
White people?

295
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:30,720
No.
And uh,

296
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,870
and what white people do.

297
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,450
He started as a blog and he said one 
thing about white people,

298
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,060
they are into their coffee man.
Like,

299
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,200
I love it.
My coach Tony Jeffries was like,

300
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:43,900
you're the only guy I know who drinks 
coffee in between rounds.

301
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,170
I'll get a big,
a big cup of coffee and drinking in 

302
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,170
between.
Right.

303
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:49,410
That's hilarious.
You know,

304
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,060
Tito told me that the coffee fucks with 
your cardio.

305
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,370
He says he doesn't drink any.
It doesn't take any caffeine.

306
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,280
So Cardio fucks with your cardio.
I've heard different.

307
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,980
Now if your favorite says,
I'm going to listen.

308
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,040
No Shit.
Tito Ortiz tells me that I was with Tito

309
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,360
two days ago in a bar in by accident.
Lori sat and he,

310
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,180
it was his cheat day and he was drinking
a Shirley temple,

311
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,100
like literally in this really girly 
glass,

312
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,840
so here's this giant to drinking a very,
very pink drink.

313
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,520
I was like,
that's Hilarious,

314
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,930
man.
He had tremendous cardio.

315
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,340
Tito's cargill to take Abbott Strength 
Coach tells me not to drink caffeine.

316
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm going to list.
You know what I'm saying?

317
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,880
There's,
there's certain people you need to 

318
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,780
listen to what works for you man.
His Cardio is insane.

319
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,140
Crazy.
That fight where,

320
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,560
who was the fight where the guy got on 
his back?

321
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:43,561
Well,
within the first minute of the first 

322
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:43,561
round,
like there was like solid,

323
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:46,300
reliable,
ramble able to Hilo,

324
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:49,200
but that's obviously not him because 
apple tree hill is the bad ass.

325
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,430
A welterweight that,
that name stuck in my head.

326
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,470
Well,
let's just look it up.

327
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,180
The Guy got right away.
Right?

328
00:13:55,181 --> 00:14:00,181
And they're like,
just exactly where your ride doesn't 

329
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:00,181
want to be tough.
He's,

330
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:01,270
he's been,
he's been done it right.

331
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,580
You know,
like did you see that able to Hilo,

332
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,210
Jamie varner fight.
That was fucking insane.

333
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,780
What a crazy slugfest slobber docker.
Oh my God.

334
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I don't know why I thought why able to 
Hilo was my name was coming into my 

335
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,991
mind.
I got to pull up the student's name to 

336
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:21,991
find out why that was.
Oh,

337
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,550
Uriel Contra.
So it was just another cool name.

338
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah.
Brian Callen isn't it really?

339
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:32,260
It's too much about,
but the pace that uriah put on that.

340
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:33,460
Uri,
I'll contract guy.

341
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,990
That's.
I wish I was a little guy.

342
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,430
If I was little.
I mean I feel like I should be a member 

343
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:40,430
of team Alpha male.
I love long distance running.

344
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,130
I love eating healthy.
I love dieting.

345
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,510
I want to be a small guy.
Well,

346
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:48,511
you're very fit to for heavyweight.
You have like some pretty extreme 

347
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:51,680
endurance for for a heavyweight.
Do you say that like what's going today?

348
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:51,980
Like with

349
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,490
a guy like Travis Brown or with guys 
like John Jones or yourself,

350
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,820
you getting a lot of people that were 
athletes in other sports that were like 

351
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,170
high level athletes and then 
transitioned over into fighting.

352
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,020
So in the beginning you're seeing like 
they're learning.

353
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,770
They're really good athletes so they 
move quicker than most people.

354
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
They usually have a little bit more 
physical explosion power than most 

355
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,020
people,
but then it takes them awhile to get all

356
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:20,021
the techniques down.
Now we're seeing like a lot of those 

357
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,901
dudes,
but this is that we're seeing Osp is 

358
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:22,901
another one opens.
I would say a lot.

359
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:24,890
I think we're seeing a number of them 
starting to transition,

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,850
but the thing is,
I know I've done with tons of nfl guys,

361
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,910
Mba,
when someone's trying to hit you in the 

362
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,950
face and you're just not.
That's why it takes so long.

363
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:38,951
I think for these athletes to adapt a 
fighting because getting hit in the 

364
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:38,951
face,
it's just,

365
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:38,951
it's just not either.

366
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,400
You were born where you're like,
yeah,

367
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,140
this is cool.
I can live with this.

368
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:47,141
I can learn.
Learn to get out of the way and you 

369
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:47,141
know,
put my life on the line.

370
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:49,040
And then usually when guys are that good
of athletes,

371
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:49,970
like,
forget this,

372
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,340
forget this man,
forget this,

373
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,270
isn't it?
I think,

374
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,750
I think you look like at the UFC and 
guys starting to come around,

375
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,310
but people think to me,
you know,

376
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,500
in 10 years we have all these freak 
athletes.

377
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,540
You're not man,
because he's freak athletes.

378
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,000
It's very rare you get a freak athlete 
who's like,

379
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,120
yeah,
I'm going to go fight another killer in 

380
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,460
a steel cage.
That's a very interesting point.

381
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,770
It's a very interesting point when 
there's options to write,

382
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:17,771
especially,
especially when you're that good of an 

383
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:17,771
athlete and you're making way more 
money.

384
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:17,771
Well,
not necessarily.

385
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:17,900
Not necessarily.

386
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,000
You know,
it depends on what level you're fighting

387
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:21,110
in the UFC,
you know?

388
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,140
I mean,
if you're a guy will say about this all 

389
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,140
the time,
like,

390
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,140
oh,
you guys don't get paid yet.

391
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,600
I make a great living man.
Yeah.

392
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:30,070
It's not true.
The first one.

393
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,310
No,
no,

394
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,450
no.
Hold up.

395
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,440
You're talking about the.
You're talking about the exception.

396
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,130
I make more than a Lotta yes.
Well,

397
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:39,290
here's what you have to understand.
When you look at pay,

398
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,160
okay.
Like there's pay that's listed like a.

399
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,190
As far as like the purse that you get 
admission,

400
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,250
they list out what your staff does not.
That doesn't take into account a lot of 

401
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,521
factors.
There's a lot of things that they want 

402
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,171
to remain private so you're.
You're not just getting paid that 

403
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:56,171
amount.
Some people are,

404
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,830
some people are just getting paid that 
amount,

405
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,480
but guys you don't know that probably 
should begin paid that amount,

406
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,870
but when a guy is selling tickets,
you know someone is a big name fighter.

407
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:10,820
There's a lot of factors in there is 
there's well incentives.

408
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,910
Paperview pieces of paper for sure.
Like George St Pierre was making 

409
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:15,910
$5,000,000
a fight.

410
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,400
That's pretty good.
Yeah.

411
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,380
Let's make it a lot of fucking money and
you know,

412
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,000
he's got sponsors.
You said Gatorade,

413
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:25,001
all this other stuff.
All this other revenue coming in and 

414
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:26,960
George St Pierre made a load of money 
fighting so maybe maybe it didn't make 

415
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:29,480
as much as floyd mayweather,
but guess what?

416
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Floyd Mayweather.
Floyd mayweather is one a bigger star to

417
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,680
a better promoter.
He's a fucking.

418
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,580
That doesn't matter what a guide and 
there's that.

419
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:45,581
Well,
social UFC now use is pretty worldwide 

420
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:45,581
now,
but it doesn't.

421
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,640
You could be.
There could be a spectacular fight in 

422
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,041
the UFC,
a crazy epic fight that everybody wants 

423
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:51,041
to see.
That could do one and

424
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,020
a half million,
2 million pay per view buys.

425
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,250
That's what floyd mayweather is done.
It is possible.

426
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,280
That could happen.
When you think about before Floyd Floyd 

427
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Mayweather,
it was.

428
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,210
It's hard to find like a guy since Oscar
de la Hoya,

429
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:02,310
maybe manny Pacquiao a guy who can do 
like.

430
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,860
There's only a few of those guys,
like everybody wants to say,

431
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,560
oh,
in boxing they make so much more money.

432
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,840
No,
there's about five of.

433
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,680
You have those guys.
You're talking about the exception.

434
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,420
People always refer to the exception 
mayweather Pacquiao or the exception.

435
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,510
Look at the.
If you watch this,

436
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,900
this last fight with Bradley,
look at the undercard.

437
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,440
It was pure shit.
It was horrible.

438
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,140
Those guys are scrapping.
I thought it was a good fight.

439
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,340
I thought.
I thought the undercard was pack.

440
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,070
Y'all Bradley's pack your bag.
That was good.

441
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:37,071
That was a really good.
There were some good fights in the 

442
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:37,071
undercard.

443
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:37,071
It wasn't bad.
I enjoyed it.

444
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:38,590
Who was your favorite on the undercard?
Uh,

445
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,320
I'd have to look at it.
Exactly.

446
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,760
That's my.
That's my,

447
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,880
that's my point.
That's the problem with lots of no one 

448
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
gives a flying hoot about the underdog.
No one just no one gives a shit because 

449
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,260
you don't know him.
These guys are super talented and 

450
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,170
they're not making any money on time.
You okay?

451
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:57,060
Here it is.
At a certain point in time,

452
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:02,090
there's only so many fucking room room 
for so many fighters you can keep in 

453
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,580
your head.
Put boxing,

454
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,490
boxing.
I mean,

455
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:06,160
let's go.
I mean,

456
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,960
at heavyweight especially,
you got clear.

457
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:14,030
Listen,
Klitschko could probably deliver pizza 

458
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,030
next door and no one's going to ask for 
an autograph.

459
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,280
Isn't that weird?
That's crazy,

460
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:19,281
right?
That's was so dominant that your 

461
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:19,281
heavyweight champ.
No one gives a shit.

462
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:19,281
That's so weird.

463
00:19:19,281 --> 00:19:21,600
I find people were tweeting about the 
under under crowd.

464
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,450
They were tweeting,
being defensive about the,

465
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,440
that the,
uh,

466
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,860
the uh,
hbo commentators were being defensive 

467
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,130
about the quality of the undercard.
So maybe you're right,

468
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,120
I just tuned in and I may or may not 
have been high as fuck.

469
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,600
So I had a good time.
I was white boxing fall by the wayside.

470
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,570
This isn't really.
It hasn't.

471
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,870
That's a misconception.
It hasn't fallen by the wayside.

472
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,820
It's just there's only a few guys that 
can sell big pay per view.

473
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,910
Right.
Like maybe you know,

474
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,330
there's maybe like four or five guys 
that can sell.

475
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,600
They don't.
Tell me one story.

476
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:56,790
Look at the UFC.
There's a countdown.

477
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,090
Every damn Tuesday.
Wednesday on billy.

478
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,770
Billy Billy's mom passed away and he 
decided to turn to fighting the UFC does

479
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,230
the best job of marketing.
It's guys.

480
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,760
There was one fight that was actually 
really good vargas versus that.

481
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,940
A Russian cat.
Yeah.

482
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,980
That was a good fight.
Yeah.

483
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,430
They were both on the feeding.
Yeah.

484
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,750
That was good for.
I was a very good.

485
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Again though,
we're talking about that dude versus 

486
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:20,820
Russian.
Do these motherfuckers,

487
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,420
man,
beast Russians that are making their way

488
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,820
into mma now,
making their way into boxing now.

489
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,480
It's really fascinating how many bad ass
Russians.

490
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,170
It's just living in the area.
Animals.

491
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,090
Scary really well,
it's also the epigenetics,

492
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,070
you know,
they're.

493
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,010
They're saying that now that people who 
have had family members,

494
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,200
this was something that's passed down 
through sperm.

495
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:48,470
They believe traumatic events through 
your ancestry or passed down through 

496
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,191
sperm and people who are children,
people who were the children's children 

497
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:58,651
and children of people who have survived
traumatic disorders or traumatic 

498
00:20:58,651 --> 00:21:02,821
incidents were more likely to develop 
all sorts of mental problems were more 

499
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:05,380
likely to be like schizophrenia,
like all these,

500
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,530
all these issues,
mental issues that they could directly 

501
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,460
correlate possibly to the trauma that 
their ancestors have established.

502
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,110
Now think about how rude you are.
If you're little,

503
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,480
if your little kenny grown up in Malibu 
and you want to be a fighter,

504
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,120
good luck competing with those guys over
in Siberia.

505
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:22,620
Yeah,
no,

506
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,590
I'm going to turn them back now.
You're fucked man.

507
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,140
Just forget it.
We're just hungry.

508
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,770
They have different jaws.
They're just different.

509
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,420
Look in there and playing.
Grab ass with fricking Bruce Jenner.

510
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,380
Meanwhile,
this Guy Barry,

511
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,490
a fricking wrestling.
That is hilarious.

512
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,320
Who's that?
Who's that?

513
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,380
Golovkin Khaled can congest triple g.
he's the next big star.

514
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,780
He's big,
he's a fucking animal.

515
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,820
He really is.
Body shots.

516
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,560
No one wants to fight them.
I'll tell you what,

517
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm excited for the Sergio Martinez and 
Miguel.

518
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,330
Miguel cotto has been looking very good 
and his last few fights and Martinez is 

519
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,990
almost 40 at a certain point and with 
his style,

520
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:03,850
very different style than Bernard 
Hopkins.

521
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,900
You know,
Bernard Hopkins,

522
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,840
Forty Eight fucking years old.
Crazy.

523
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Still out boxing the shit out of Sergio 
is all about footwork and some point 

524
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:15,280
during that footwork goes away.
He's gonna get in trouble and his left,

525
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:17,550
he's got a brutal,
brutal lefthand and it's.

526
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,880
He mean he comes in with everything.
He's so good at his movement and his is 

527
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,850
in and out movement.
He uses that same in and out movement to

528
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,920
land but devastating.
This is what we're talking about.

529
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,540
Fear.
So He's almost 40.

530
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,710
He played soccer almost all his life and
then got into boxing I think at 28.

531
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,010
Twenty nine.
No.

532
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,770
Yeah,
multi-time world champ.

533
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,930
No matter when you start with your Tito 
Ortiz or veto for starting at 18,

534
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:44,440
19 year old or your Sergio Martinez 
started at 30,

535
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,200
no matter when you start,
your clock is ticking.

536
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,270
You have this amount of fights in you.

537
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,950
No matter when.
I mean,

538
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,840
yeah guys drag it on,
you know,

539
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,170
via a fade or a cro.
Cop guys are drag it on,

540
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,350
but you're only going to be in your 
prime and you're going to have these 

541
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,350
many great fights in there.
It doesn't matter when you start talking

542
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,310
to eve Edwards about that.
He's 37 now and he's,

543
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:08,311
he's.
He was saying one of the frustrating 

544
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:08,311
things for fighters I think is that you 
learn the art.

545
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:09,130
You,
you continue to learn.

546
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
There's so much to learn,
but you continue to learn and then you 

547
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,341
get to be 37,
38 and you may be a step slower but you 

548
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:17,650
know so much more so you just want to 
try it out.

549
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:20,890
But the game is also timing and speed.
And guess what?

550
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:24,220
That's why it came about because those 
37,

551
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:25,660
38 year olds are like,
Dang,

552
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:28,720
I know so much man,
but my body's not the same.

553
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,270
Let me talk this doctor over here.
Now we have epic.

554
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,730
Dammit.
Now we've got big data.

555
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,960
It's not an episodic.
It's an epic.

556
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,640
No,
you're right though.

557
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,970
In Brazil,
spinning back,

558
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:45,540
kick in,
people's faces off in Brazil.

559
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,840
All T are teed up.
Joe Silva said it best.

560
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:53,110
He goes,
it's like [inaudible] or downloaded a 

561
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,290
taekwondo black belt.
All of a sudden thrown.

562
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,520
We'll never,
never to a wheelchair and then knocked 

563
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:58,520
out.
Luke rockhold.

564
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,340
Luke rockhold is a beast.
I mean for him to do it with ease and 

565
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,990
then bisbing what?
I think you nailed it.

566
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:11,010
What you nailed is exactly what it is,
is that these guys get older and they 

567
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,490
get so much more experienced,
so much more knowledge,

568
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:15,020
but that's the nature.
Balance.

569
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,480
Nature gives you that experience and 
knowledge so you can teach.

570
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:21,140
It's like the two old.
It's like the two old buffalo,

571
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,040
the old buffalo in the young boy and a 
cat.

572
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,750
I don't know this too on the calf.
The calf goes,

573
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,780
what is it?
Buffalo,

574
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
the young girl,
the young bomb y'all bought and the be 

575
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
buffalo.
Let's go buffalo.

576
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Yeah.
He goes,

577
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,590
he goes,
let's go down there.

578
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,160
Fuck all those.
Fuck one of those cow.

579
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,440
No,
no,

580
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,480
no.
You fucked it up already.

581
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,900
Listen,
this is what he says.

582
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,990
Listen.
He goes,

583
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:45,040
let's run down there and fuck one of 
those cat.

584
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,960
And the old bull says,
let's walk down there and fuck them.

585
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,390
All right.
All right.

586
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,600
This is the other thing though.
When when these I get it to me and you 

587
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:00,020
were still going to fuck it up.
Fuck,

588
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,470
this is the thing though.
Or bell form those guys.

589
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:06,380
The sport wasn't as big when they were 
when they were superstars.

590
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,700
Right?
And now they're like,

591
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,380
whoa,
the sports huge.

592
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:13,820
I can stick around and take this stuff 
and make all this money and be relevant.

593
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,550
You know what I'm saying is there's 
vituro show that again,

594
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:19,010
Jamie,
look at this.

595
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,110
Look at this.
Oh,

596
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,900
that's not just doing that.
It's doing that to luke rockhold.

597
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,360
Who's better looking in Brendan Shop?
Maybe easy.

598
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,420
Now,
let me tell you some muscles on his 

599
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:31,420
teeth really does.
Let me tell you this though.

600
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,520
Luke rockhold flew for 17 hours from San
Jose,

601
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:39,410
California,
showed up on a Saturday night.

602
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,100
Got We'll kicked in the face and jump 
back on a plane.

603
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,590
That's got to suck.
It does suck.

604
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,370
I thought.
No.

605
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,400
Garren Brazil.
Can you tell Joe to the story about the 

606
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,800
other stuff?
Are you allowed to about which one?

607
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,630
What other stuff?
Money Jersey.

608
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,580
Oh yeah,
for sure.

609
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,090
Tell us why,
but they're secret.

610
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,440
They're not really for sure.
Quit eating those nuts because that's 

611
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,440
fucking fucked up my whole game.
Yeah,

612
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,600
stop all that.
Before we tell any story,

613
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,050
I want to go back to this trt thing 
because we can't just gloss over it like

614
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:09,210
that.

615
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:09,660
No,
no.

616
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,560
It's a huge subject.
I think you nailed it though too,

617
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:17,561
and you did too.
Talking about Eve Edwards feelings of 

618
00:26:17,561 --> 00:26:18,080
all the knowledge he's acquired these.
That is.

619
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,660
That does seem to be like nature's 
balancing act,

620
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:21,090
right?
Yeah.

621
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:26,410
Like nature doesn't want you to have all
that knowledge and all that and live 

622
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,170
forever.
It's like God saying,

623
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,220
no,
you got it cool.

624
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:29,120
Oh,
your body sucks.

625
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,080
You can't do it anymore.
Well,

626
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,410
it's sort of like the beauty of 
everything is that it's temporary.

627
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,820
Like what's,
what's our favorite thing?

628
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:36,260
Let's be realistic.
Sex.

629
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,180
Most people's favorite thing.
It's sex.

630
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:43,390
When you're really horny and you're 
having sex with someone who you really 

631
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,331
like having sex with,
it's one of the greatest things on 

632
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:46,331
earth.
One of the great things about,

633
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:47,210
as you know,
it's not gonna last you got,

634
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,630
look,
if you're a seller,

635
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,090
did you're great.

636
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,040
You'd be bored of it.
That's why guys do drugs and stuff.

637
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:58,041
See,
this is the people are freaks and 

638
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,991
they're just fucking.
Their pupils are this big and then they 

639
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:02,130
never opened the fucking curtain.
Those people are taking the same concept

640
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:02,790
with sex.
He's like,

641
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,920
man,
Yo would make this even better if we did

642
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:06,270
molly on this.
Yeah,

643
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,940
well those same differences like 
fighting,

644
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,070
but you know,
it'd be better if I did steroids,

645
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:12,930
so this is a good point because the 
molly thing,

646
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,300
if you do it on molly when all that 
stuff wears off,

647
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:20,301
which it will wear off eventually you 
are because you,

648
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,520
you're in debt,
you're like a kid with a student loan.

649
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,790
Like you started out of the gate,
like you're not belonging to us on 

650
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,241
sesame street.
Just super dally paid way more than you 

651
00:27:32,241 --> 00:27:32,700
have.
It's like seeing what you see.

652
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,700
Those people who are just like,
they're now they're 53 hanging around a 

653
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,530
coffee shop with a ponytail and really 
have a job to try and try and get things

654
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:42,060
out and you're like,
oh,

655
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:47,061
you had a really good time for 15 years.
That's the same with fighting some 

656
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,580
fighters.
I'll meet some fighters who are so 

657
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,490
punchy and there may be 40,
45 for 15 years.

658
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:56,280
This guy was the man I wanted to be him.
Now I look.

659
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:56,820
I'm like,
dude,

660
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:59,340
you make me never want to fight again.
What were you doing?

661
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,210
Do you have a number in your head where 
like you're,

662
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:07,211
you're,
or a place in your head where you're 

663
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:07,211
going to reach,
where you're like,

664
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:10,731
that's it,
whether it's an age number or whether 

665
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:13,491
it's a physical number,
does a gut feeling that you're gonna 

666
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:13,491
have when you know,
when the hanging out?

667
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:13,491
I think,
you know,

668
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,931
I think you know,
but do you know the problem people ask 

669
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:17,980
me this now,
people you know,

670
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,020
when do you think,
you know,

671
00:28:19,021 --> 00:28:20,970
I probably say I have a good five years 
left,

672
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,460
especially the way I train.
Right?

673
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,650
Brian,
you know I don't have an off season.

674
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm in shape year round.
I trained nonstop around year round.

675
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,130
Do you do that to continue with your 
improvement or do you also do that in 

676
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,341
case someone calls,
like in case you get a last minute 

677
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:37,341
justice just to get it,
just to get better,

678
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,000
just to get better.
Continuing to improve.

679
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:42,490
The only reason he's always dressed 
well,

680
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
amen.
If that's the right attitude to have in 

681
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:47,900
the hurt business,
you know you can't be casual about their

682
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,640
monsters out there.
And that's Mark Hunt.

683
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,940
I just called out Mark Hunt,
you try and listen to this.

684
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,700
He talks shit to me on twitter at 10:00
at night,

685
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,040
which is whatever time in New Zealand,
it's 10:00

686
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:04,041
and I read it like a whatever.
I'm watching naked and afraid or teen 

687
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:04,041
mom or some bullshit,
right?

688
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:04,590
I'm like,
whatever.

689
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,330
Sitting there,
it's just killing me.

690
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:08,790
I'm like,
fuck this guy back on that.

691
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,010
I talked to him.
He bikes,

692
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:14,280
we're going back and forth.
Finally it was almost like,

693
00:29:14,281 --> 00:29:15,210
you know,
like butter.

694
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,540
It just Bam.
Next thing I know I had him agree to a 

695
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,201
winner.
Takes all fight and will fight in an 

696
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:24,201
August winner takes all market,
Brenden's shop main event.

697
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,560
You're having a winner.
Takes all fine.

698
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,630
It was my idea.
So how does that work?

699
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:30,210
Like financially?
Like as far as like with the UFC,

700
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,870
the UFC won't sanction it.
Okay.

701
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,650
So him your purse when he's going to pay
me his porsche perse,

702
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:38,360
but.
Oh okay.

703
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,390
Yeah,
that's what I meant.

704
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,250
I was just say like Mike

705
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,140
and I,
you know,

706
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:47,680
it's just a proper way.
But the thing is you get all hyped up.

707
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:52,681
I had done with that sitting in bed,
my heart's going a million miles an 

708
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:53,680
hour.
I just called out the whatever,

709
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:56,080
number five,
six heavyweight in the world,

710
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,410
the hardest hitter in the division,
and it's a winner.

711
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:01,790
Takes all fight,
not announced asleep.

712
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,120
You know what I'm saying?
Seven am went to practice.

713
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,470
No pressure.
No pressure.

714
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,330
That that was a Wednesday night and you 
want to be a UFC fighter?

715
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Fuck yeah.
The pressure's probably alien to most 

716
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,230
people couldn't even fight week.
What?

717
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,460
Fight Week.
Depression.

718
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:23,520
You think about all the other avenues 
you could have gone down to avoid 

719
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,451
jumping into that cage for sure.
When you add everything goes through 

720
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:27,451
your mind when all the other avenues in 
life like,

721
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:27,670
yeah,
for sure.

722
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,790
I should be married with kids.
I can be wearing a suit and tie.

723
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,340
Got I got.
I'm a double major from history.

724
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,320
Colorado could be doing this.
I should've done this.

725
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:37,230
I could've done this blending.
Is that.

726
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:39,610
When does that go away?
When does that go away?

727
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,360
A man pray,
right?

728
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,180
Right,
right.

729
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,040
When I get in the cage,
when I hit the Kratom cool.

730
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,720
In the back I'm like,
Hey,

731
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,310
what are we doing?
So once you hit the crowd then you like,

732
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,320
it's on your load and your body can 
relax and at least it's going to get a 

733
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,640
release from all this tension.
Yeah,

734
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,230
isn't that what it is?
It's like once the first round starts,

735
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,370
people would think like,
God,

736
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:03,820
it must be scary to fight,
but I would imagine that the most brutal

737
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:06,870
thing is just getting the buildup.
This building.

738
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,410
Oh,
when?

739
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,410
When?
When you're fighting.

740
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:13,411
You know,
in my last fight I was the Komen men or 

741
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:13,411
second,
third fight.

742
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:15,430
In Toronto you'll see one 65 million 
summitry own.

743
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,550
I mean we didn't fight till 9:00
at night.

744
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,580
You're waiting around all day thinking 
about the fight and when do you eat?

745
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,380
It's tough for me because my nerves.
That's why everyone's like go shop.

746
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:25,960
She got two,
two.

747
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:28,360
Oh,
five lists on 252 pounds.

748
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,210
Right now the only reason I weigh in so 
lights because I can't eat,

749
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,390
I can't eat.
So that's why.

750
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,220
Wow,
that's crazy.

751
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,380
I love reading because he gets,
he's so honest about it.

752
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:40,690
He calls out Alistair overeem on twitter
at [inaudible] and he's like,

753
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,040
he's like,
he stops and he goes,

754
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,420
hey,
God told him that.

755
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:48,421
He was like,
I gotta go try and hit the ground 

756
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:48,421
running,
man.

757
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:50,110
Well,
that's good though,

758
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:50,890
isn't it?
Yeah.

759
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,840
So it was honesty,
honesty,

760
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:53,590
fear.
Oh,

761
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:54,250
people,
uh,

762
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,900
people all the time like,
Oh man,

763
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:57,870
you,
chuck Ladell is not like that Broccoli.

764
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,490
I hate to tell you my man,
your favorite fighters.

765
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:03,140
Just scared to admit it.
I'm not scared to admit you.

766
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:05,080
You know,
people are terrified back there.

767
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,010
You're going to fight another train 
killer inside the octagon.

768
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:12,130
Basically in your underwear in front of 
millions of people,

769
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,890
millions of people.
You can be a little scared.

770
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,330
I hate to tell you that.
I hate to tell you that man.

771
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:23,331
I hate to tell her.
How could you think to you when you're 

772
00:32:23,331 --> 00:32:26,310
fucking cool hand?
Luke was a good actor and he said,

773
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,490
there's a very,
there's a close relationship between 

774
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:31,490
fear and intelligence.
He said,

775
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:32,770
anybody who's not,
who's not afraid at all,

776
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,900
as is,
I always go shake my head.

777
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:36,720
I got that guy's not very smart.
I'll tell you what,

778
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,070
Ken Kenny told me this,
tough fighters don't laughs.

779
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
Last smart

780
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,330
fighters do,
and he's right,

781
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,770
man.
That's totally right.

782
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,200
He's so.
He's so not hopkins.

783
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,280
Back to Barnard hop,
right?

784
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,570
Forty eight years old in boxing and he 
talks clear.

785
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,900
You know,
I mean he doesn't have any insurance.

786
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,150
Very rarely gets hit clean.
Very rarely.

787
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,460
He might get hit cleaned two or three 
times the same way,

788
00:32:58,461 --> 00:32:59,820
right?
Very rarely use it.

789
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,570
Last guy to hit him clean with sugar.
Shane Mosley,

790
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,360
sugar Shane Mosley rocked with a right 
hand and covered up,

791
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:07,880
recovered them boxes.
That instagram of sugar.

792
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,290
Shane,
between you and Tim Teebo,

793
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:12,100
he looked like you guys want them in 
something like he's tiny.

794
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,580
Tell you what he was.
He was a tad punchy.

795
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:17,050
I'm not gonna lie to you a little bit 
punchy floyd.

796
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,380
No sugar.
Shane.

797
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,580
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

798
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,770
No.
Yeah,

799
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:21,410
I'm sure.
Sugar.

800
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,840
Shane's a little,
little hunches.

801
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,390
He sees Bradley is going to be punching.

802
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,400
I've never seen anybody.
I've never seen him a take that kind of 

803
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:31,400
punishment.
And do you think it's worth it?

804
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,100
Joe,
what about the prevent knockoff fights?

805
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,970
Did you see that thing I've ever seen?
He fought a fucking way.

806
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,730
Max Kellerman described it.
You took a Siberian caveman,

807
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,540
thought them out and then put boxing 
gloves on them.

808
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,510
That's what that guy had slurred speech 
for at least a month after.

809
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,950
Yeah.
He talked about it after the fact.

810
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,420
So you guys have kids.
Your kid wants to fight and they,

811
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,620
you know,
most likely there's going to be some 

812
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,620
trouble down the road with his brain.
If he's a fighter,

813
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:54,620
you say,
cool.

814
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,680
You say you do whatever you want to do,
but that's what you want to do.

815
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,960
You have to be.
You can't have asset.

816
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,850
You can't have.
I don't want my kid to happen.

817
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,710
I didn't say lazy.
Muggy here.

818
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,080
If you want to do it,
if that's what you want to do,

819
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,140
that's what you should do.
I don't think anyone should do anything 

820
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,050
other than that's gets to a certain 
point until,

821
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,080
look,
that's what I wanted to do when I was 

822
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,080
young.
I wanted to fight.

823
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,080
When I first figured out at a certain 
point in time,

824
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,890
there was no future.
That's when I stopped doing it.

825
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:23,950
Well,
I'm worried about bringing made you 

826
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:23,950
realize there is no fuel,
nothing in 1989 when my hand,

827
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,580
my last kickboxing match,
there was nothing.

828
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:27,650
There was no kickboxing,
taekwondo.

829
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,050
I couldn't respect it the way I used to 
respect it because I started kickboxing 

830
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,410
and I realized kickboxing,
you start eating it.

831
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:41,470
I fought above the waist pka style and 
then I started training more and then I 

832
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:46,990
realized like there was even more holes 
in the above the waist time,

833
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,950
but above the waist pk style.

834
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,210
The.
The real problem was the boxing there.

835
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,840
I had done taekwondo for so long,
like my,

836
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:58,890
my hands were shit and my ability to 
like move and throw kicks and punches 

837
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,620
together.
It was all disjointed.

838
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:02,300
It just wasn't the right way to do 
things.

839
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,200
Then when did you get into Jujitsu?
Ninety six.

840
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,090
It was,
yeah,

841
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,040
it was.
Y'All caught me at it.

842
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,740
So I,
I went through this period where I was 

843
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,740
training like all the time in a martial 
art that had all these holes in it,

844
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,840
so I wasn't ever going to go back and 
compete,

845
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,960
like try to make the US Olympic team or 
anything like that because I didn't feel

846
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:25,961
the same way about taekwondo.
I didn't want to just do it anymore 

847
00:35:25,961 --> 00:35:28,720
because I knew how easy it is for a guy 
just cover up and walk you down and 

848
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,161
corner you in a,
in a ring and fuck you up because you 

849
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:33,830
don't know how to deal with hands.
It's just there was so many holes in it.

850
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,920
So it's so much easier to punch you in 
the face when a guys were

851
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,430
throwing kicks and punches together and 
you didn't understand like the rhythm 

852
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,500
and the distance of punches.
So when I went from that,

853
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:49,110
like I had no choice,
there was no options.

854
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,020
But if there was an option,
like if kickboxing paid,

855
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:56,820
like what boxing does,
if there was a UFC option at that time I

856
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:01,821
would have had to learn grappling.
So I probably still wouldn't have 

857
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:01,821
competed in the UFC.
If there was something like that,

858
00:36:01,821 --> 00:36:02,920
like when I first started,
uh,

859
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,280
grappling when I first started Jujitsu 
in [inaudible] 96,

860
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,210
I was amazed at how easy it was for 
mended,

861
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,460
just raped me.
Just ragdoll me,

862
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,430
choked me,
Armbar me at will because I had,

863
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,910
they looked the same size as me.
Like they look pretty similar.

864
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:19,740
I looked at these people and I'd be 
like,

865
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:21,090
well,
you're not bigger than me.

866
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,740
Like if I realize how vulnerable you 
are.

867
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,060
Oh,
it's disturbing.

868
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,210
I think fighting,
like even learning a little bit of fun 

869
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:29,210
and makes you more afraid.
Not less for more humble for sure.

870
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,430
So also don't you feel like at all the 
pro athletes fighters are probably the 

871
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,060
most approachable in the most down to 
earth,

872
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,980
easy,
easy shot.

873
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,940
There's a reason why when a UFC fighter 
goes into an event,

874
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:43,830
whether it's the sps,
whatever it is,

875
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,990
all sorts of stuff,
right?

876
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,640
There can be NBA,
Nhl,

877
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,870
nfl,
the WHO's who,

878
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,430
actors.
The room wants.

879
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,450
Talk to the finer because guess what?
No one was willing to do what a fighter 

880
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:59,601
does.
So when a famous fighter walks in the 

881
00:36:59,601 --> 00:36:59,601
room,
he's the center of attention.

882
00:36:59,601 --> 00:36:59,601
Every time,
man,

883
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:00,030
that's fast.
And every time when,

884
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,520
if there's Michael Jordan and like Uriah
Faber,

885
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,550
different store in Michael Jordan,
Michael Jordan's lithium now Muhammad 

886
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,170
Ali.
Michael Jordan.

887
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:13,110
I bet you Muhammad Ali's going to get 
some Jordan's mom.

888
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,840
I'll leave right now.
Who's on whatever when he was young.

889
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:16,740
Yeah.
How about.

890
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,640
Okay,
let's prep Mike.

891
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,020
Mike Tyson,
86.

892
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:19,920
Mike Tyson.
Mike doing.

893
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,810
I bet you more people go up to Mike 
Tyson,

894
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Mike Tyson and 86 taps into the street 
and people would call their friends to 

895
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,230
the fact that there's a man in the room 
that can kill everybody with his bare 

896
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,230
hands.
Yeah,

897
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,230
and that.
That's,

898
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,690
that's fascinating to met.
That's the John l Sullivan.

899
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:35,560
I can lick any man in this room,
but everyone.

900
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,470
When you're a kid,
everyone wants to be a fighter.

901
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:38,830
You're fighting your brother,
your kid.

902
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,970
The neighborhood.
Right?

903
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,960
What sports boiled down to the raw 
element.

904
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,510
It's like the game you're playing is 
let's play,

905
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,060
kill you.
Let's try.

906
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,700
You try to kill me.
I tried to kill you in.

907
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,300
Some of them are the game,
right?

908
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,640
Like football's a game.
Basketball is a game.

909
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,410
Listen,
if if Lebron James,

910
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,050
Mrs Jumpshot.
Hey listen,

911
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:02,060
he's going to go tomorrow.
If I missed the timing of Mark Hunt's 

912
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,150
left hook,
listen,

913
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,880
my jaws will be shattered in 30 
different spots.

914
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,380
I'm not fighting for probably a year and
a half.

915
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,750
That's the difference.
That's the stakes are a lot higher.

916
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,210
Way Higher.
Not even comparable.

917
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:17,211
It not comparable at all.
You could lose 20 basketball games in a 

918
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,721
row and still go to the movies.
You imagine if you lost 20 fights in a 

919
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:20,721
row,
not going to have a job.

920
00:38:20,721 --> 00:38:22,020
It'd be impossible when you're 
physically.

921
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,680
Well,
you know,

922
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:27,681
I was trying to.
Eddie Bravo and I were talking about 

923
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:27,681
this.
This is a perfect way to describe.

924
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:31,491
One of the great things about Hugh Jitsu
is think about how many times you've 

925
00:38:31,491 --> 00:38:32,460
been tapped in your life in,
in Jujitsu.

926
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,980
I probably been tapped a 100 times.
Now.

927
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,190
What if I had been head

928
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,970
kick,
knocked out 100 times?

929
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,500
What if 100 times I got.
We'll kick like Luke rockhold.

930
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,520
Could you imagine a person who's been 
wheelchair?

931
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,340
I'd be dead.
I don't think you could take full meal.

932
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,880
Kicks it back to those in your life to 
have some problems.

933
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,340
You'd have nothing left.
You'd have literally nothing left,

934
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:59,520
but you can do that.
You can get rid of naked choked 100 

935
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,500
times in a month and you're okay.
True.

936
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,650
You're going to be sore,
you're really sore,

937
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,990
but you're going to be okay.
And there's a big difference between the

938
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,770
teeth move,
but this is the difference in striking.

939
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,810
If someone's about to blast me with the 
right hand,

940
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:12,160
I can't tap out and be like,
Nah,

941
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:12,700
we're good,
man.

942
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,330
Yeah,
you got that.

943
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,810
You got that.
That's good too.

944
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,530
If listen,
if you're going to get the guy who's 

945
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:20,530
like,
if I get a of some,

946
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:20,530
I'm going to rip your arm up.

947
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,870
You're gonna be in trouble.
Some times,

948
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,630
you're not going to be able to roll 
everyday.

949
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:24,880
Yeah,
that's the difference.

950
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:26,560
That's true too.
That's true too.

951
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,080
There's a way out.
You just do.

952
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,580
There's a white flag in boxing,
you know,

953
00:39:30,581 --> 00:39:32,200
and these other sports.
There's no white flat.

954
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,380
That's why it's so crazy when someone 
doesn't use that white flag and you 

955
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:37,630
marched.
Her shit gets snapped like hands.

956
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,770
You're out for a long watch.
Sakharova break his arm.

957
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,920
Well,
that fight was over though.

958
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:46,240
How about tim?
Tim Silvia and Frank Mir.

959
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,800
Frank Mir snapped his forearm and half 
earlier,

960
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,160
Tim Silvia's trying to punch him with 
the left.

961
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,510
He knew something was wrong,
but he was like,

962
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:56,710
you know what?
Fuck it.

963
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:59,050
I'm just going to hit him with my hand.
I didn't see that.

964
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,850
Oh my God.
It's snapped.

965
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,040
Like the forearm was to stop.
No,

966
00:40:04,041 --> 00:40:04,390
no,
no.

967
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,960
See,
pull that.

968
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:10,660
Frank Mir breaks the audience.
Didn't know what was going on.

969
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,930
So the audience was yelling and I had 
explained to the audience.

970
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,130
Yeah,
I had to explain it.

971
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,290
I go watch it right here.
And the audience went,

972
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,780
Oh,
you've seen so much.

973
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,890
Watch this.
Watch this.

974
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:21,640
Watch this.
Watch this.

975
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,820
Watch the forums.
Yeah,

976
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,980
baby.
That's how powerful herb dean is.

977
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:28,220
A bad motherfucker.
He.

978
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,960
Yeah,
let's stop.

979
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:29,500
Stop,
stop,

980
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,100
stop,
stop.

981
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,350
He separates it and he's like,
Yo,

982
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:33,460
dude,
your arm is broken.

983
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:37,030
This fight is over.
You're doing the replay.

984
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,160
The audience was booing.
They were really pissed off.

985
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:41,410
I go.
Watch this right here.

986
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,380
Oh my God.
Frank Mir was one of my favorites.

987
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,640
Yeah,
my God,

988
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:49,990
that was incredible.
Arm Bar.

989
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,030
He's the only guy in the UFC,
by the way,

990
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:57,031
who's broken?
Two guys arms to high level world 

991
00:40:57,031 --> 00:40:58,240
champions arms and insane.
No,

992
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:01,870
Garrett and Frank Mir.
He almost ripped lesnar's leg apart.

993
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,970
Legs or last.
I had a normal size leg.

994
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,700
You know Masa Gotti fucked up,
man.

995
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,540
That was a bad listener.
Was tapping and they tapped again.

996
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:13,420
He taps some more and then finally the 
referee stopped it.

997
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,130
Paula [inaudible] style for sure.
Oh,

998
00:41:15,131 --> 00:41:17,020
if Paul Harvest got ahold of that,
he's.

999
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,860
Well,
he doesn't do the straight leg locks.

1000
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,250
Cool.
Locked,

1001
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,180
which is way more trouble.
Well,

1002
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:23,980
he's doing insight helix.
That's his favorite.

1003
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,440
He loves that inside.
He'll get it again to somebody.

1004
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,940
Well,
he let go.

1005
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,930
He let go.
You see?

1006
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,460
Everybody is saying that he doesn't let 
go.

1007
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,380
They're going to jump on them.
No matter what he does.

1008
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,040
If he gets submission,
they're jumping on him.

1009
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,250
He absolutely is held submissions for 
too long ago.

1010
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,870
Absolute,
not just once,

1011
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:44,140
many times.
There's fights of his in Brazil where 

1012
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,040
he's got a lock on a guy and he will not
let go in the referees.

1013
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:48,020
Prior Anatomy.
He will not let go and I don't remember.

1014
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:51,560
It was a choke or was a leg lock,
but he fucked that guy up.

1015
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,410
I heard in training.
He's the exact same way.

1016
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,760
You don't really only trains with his 
brother,

1017
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,740
his brother.
He doesn't do that with everyone else.

1018
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:58,070
Like,
no,

1019
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,740
I'm good man.
He hangs onto stuff that's so crazy.

1020
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,260
That's so scary.
A guy who does that ridiculous.

1021
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,630
Especially a guy who's built like that.
I mean she.

1022
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:10,631
It's crazy how he is the biggest hundred
and 70 pounder I've ever seen anywhere.

1023
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,070
Here's a smaller forehead than me.
Have you ever seen him?

1024
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Does we both have like my,
like my eyebrows are about to run into 

1025
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:18,960
the side here.

1026
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,750
It's very similar.
Cro-Magnon,

1027
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,060
so yeah.
Yeah.

1028
00:42:23,061 --> 00:42:25,760
He's.
That guy has the best leg locks man.

1029
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,400
His leg locks were so finishing.
You know,

1030
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:33,401
he grabs a hold of one.
It's like nine out of 10 someone's 

1031
00:42:33,401 --> 00:42:36,400
tapping for,
except Alan Belcher beat the brakes off 

1032
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,640
belts or beat the British.
Totally.

1033
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,650
Did he do it?
He he like willingly went into because 

1034
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,510
he worked in all of it and just post 
them in the face to face.

1035
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,310
Sat on top,
punch pass.

1036
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:51,670
I should ask Alan and give props to 
whoever coached him on his leg locks 

1037
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,201
there,
but Alan Belcher is a wizard at that 

1038
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,571
shit now because he prepared for that 
fight and did everything every step of 

1039
00:42:58,571 --> 00:42:58,940
the way,
like everything blocked.

1040
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:02,100
Everything knew exactly what to expect 
and you can see Paul,

1041
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:05,330
her was just so flustered.
He really didn't know what to do because

1042
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:10,331
Alan was like in right where he wanted 
in this spiderweb defending everything 

1043
00:43:10,331 --> 00:43:11,060
and then punching him in his face.

1044
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,410
He says a little bit of an issue like do
there nate Marquardt when?

1045
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,620
Yeah,
when they pulled out the leg submission.

1046
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,540
He's like,
what?

1047
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,740
What?
And then Bam blasted in the face while 

1048
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,070
he was accusing native greasing.
Leave that nate got out of his.

1049
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:26,930
Well,
nate,

1050
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,000
nate was pretty honest about what he 
did.

1051
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:33,350
He said I warmed up a lot because I knew
the guy was a really good at leg locks.

1052
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:35,510
I want it to be nice and slippery,
so I sweat a lot.

1053
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,610
You're allowed to do that for sure.
Yeah.

1054
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,650
I mean there's no issue with that,
but he's like,

1055
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,490
yeah,
he's like,

1056
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,720
what?
And as he's pointing,

1057
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:44,900
Nico's just dove on it.
It was great.

1058
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:49,901
What do you remember that fight?
He fought Dan Miller and jumped up on 

1059
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:53,741
the catch and hit him and rocked him and
for whatever reason decided to fight was

1060
00:43:53,901 --> 00:43:54,290
over.

1061
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,560
So he starts celebrating Pars case.
They pull them down from the cage.

1062
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,940
The referees,
the fight still on like you have to keep

1063
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:03,560
fighting like,
wow,

1064
00:44:03,561 --> 00:44:05,360
what are you doing?
Like did he end up winning?

1065
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,870
Well,
I think you want to sit decision,

1066
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,150
but it was one of the weirdest things 
that embarrassing.

1067
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:16,180
It's like he just decided to referee 
stop real mccastle jumping up on the 

1068
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,130
cage.
Oh,

1069
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,740
they're literally grabbing his shorts.
Were like,

1070
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:19,190
Hey,
you owe me.

1071
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,170
You're still going.
Paul hired.

1072
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,330
Pull that up.
Paul Harris versus Dan Miller.

1073
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:25,510
Um,
well if you could find it,

1074
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,220
find the,
the,

1075
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,940
the exchange because it's so bizarre.
Sweep.

1076
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:34,140
He has an issue.
Obviously if you hear you read about 

1077
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,140
that guys,

1078
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,100
childhood,
it was one of the most horrific 

1079
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,100
childhoods.
Oh,

1080
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,100
that's it,
right.

1081
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,270
That's it.
Is that look like he walks away.

1082
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,190
He's on the cage.
You have to tear them down.

1083
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,040
Yeah.
Let's look at the finish again.

1084
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Watch how muscular he is.
Dan Miller going to do it all the way 

1085
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,210
back to the beginning so we can see what
happened before.

1086
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:53,190
So he hits him.
He had some boom,

1087
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,840
boom.
And he just got,

1088
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,220
he just decided.
He just decided,

1089
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:01,730
look,
I live out.

1090
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:04,260
Dan Miller's rushing over to them to 
grab him on the cage.

1091
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,900
What was he going to do?
Just those arms are.

1092
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,480
So what does he weigh in there?
What?

1093
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:10,350
80 five.
Well,

1094
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:12,270
he weighed in at one 85.
He's probably,

1095
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:13,350
you know,
two plus.

1096
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,520
His nickname means tree stump.
Yeah.

1097
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,860
And this one,
but it's terrible.

1098
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,090
Carl and.
Oh,

1099
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,180
his childhood.
Yeah,

1100
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:21,550
his trial.

1101
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,570
It was unbelievably horrific when he was
working.

1102
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:29,571
Yeah.
He's working on a farm when he was a 

1103
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:29,571
little boy,
they eat pig slop,

1104
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:30,550
like he literally had a pig slop,
like to stay alive.

1105
00:45:30,551 --> 00:45:32,850
We had no food when he first started 
training,

1106
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,120
he was just dirt poor,
as poor as can be.

1107
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,780
This big scar on his chest.
Like they couldn't afford to take them 

1108
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,050
to a hospital.
So they glued it it like a giant gash on

1109
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:45,950
his chest and they glued it together,
you know,

1110
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,730
and when he was a little kid,
I mean he,

1111
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,760
he lived a hard,
hard life probably filled with trauma 

1112
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,961
that people like us that grew up in a 
nice neighborhood probably could never 

1113
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:57,360
understand again.
Kenny and Malibu,

1114
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:58,250
who wants to fight?
No.

1115
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,280
Macklin screwed bud.
Paul Harvey's is Super Glue in his ankle

1116
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,880
walking pigs when he was eight years 
old.

1117
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,090
Yeah,
well we're talking.

1118
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,100
We might've been talking about that.
Was that before the podcast or was it 

1119
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,100
during the commercial?
So we were saying that,

1120
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,670
but it's the epigenetics thing that 
scientists have proven that fear and 

1121
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,690
memory can be inherited via sperm and 
know that when did that,

1122
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:19,590
when did they,
when did they.

1123
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:21,180
It's been a while,
but um,

1124
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:26,210
there's,
there's papers that have been published 

1125
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,401
on it now.
Apparently researches began testing the 

1126
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:31,581
pups of traumatized dad's for a startle 
response to different smells.

1127
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,160
The assetto Fino don't settle.
Fino and stimulus had a big effect which

1128
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:41,430
was not seen in the controls to 
emphasize here.

1129
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:46,431
These pups never actually learned any 
previous foot shock trials to the set of

1130
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:51,100
phone that the phone was bad news.
I guess that was evolutionarily though,

1131
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,470
because remember Steve?
Yeah,

1132
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:57,471
because Steven Rinella said you start 
hunting and area the animals like the 

1133
00:46:57,471 --> 00:46:59,060
elk in yellowstone because the wolves 
are just introduced.

1134
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:01,770
Their generation to generations have not
had to deal with wolves.

1135
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,730
So what happens is they don't really 
know how to defend against wolves.

1136
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:10,731
They don't,
they don't have the built in several 

1137
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:10,731
responses,
etc.

1138
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:11,670
But as they start getting killed by 
wolves,

1139
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:14,670
more and more,
their offspring will learn and it.

1140
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,770
So it makes total sense.
So this is what happened.

1141
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,800
They,
they use the smell of this chemical 

1142
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,261
which has a citrusy smell.
It's called a cdot finos and it was 

1143
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:28,680
paired with a slightly discomforting 
electric shock to their feet.

1144
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,040
So that's what they did to

1145
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,040
the dads.
Then they gave the children of the dads 

1146
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,900
this set of fino and spray and they 
panicked.

1147
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,840
This is rats.
Mice,

1148
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,410
mice.
Yeah.

1149
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,690
I mean that's,
that's some insane shit,

1150
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:48,691
man.
It's just joB is that whose job was 

1151
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:48,920
like,
hey,

1152
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:50,830
you get the rats grabbed their feet,
man.

1153
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,410
Who was doing that?
Well,

1154
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,960
that's given these rat that.
That makes sense.

1155
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,890
Evolution from an evolutionary 
standpoint,

1156
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:57,420
you know,
you,

1157
00:47:57,421 --> 00:48:02,421
you,
if you continue to be haunted by lions 

1158
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:02,650
the first time at gazelle seas alliance,
it's running.

1159
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:03,910
It's not,
it doesn't have to say,

1160
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:04,810
hey,
what is that thing?

1161
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,010
So my kids going to love coffee and 
fricking thick chicks or whatever.

1162
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,560
I think every healthy,
healthy boy likes thick chicks.

1163
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,620
I was having this conversation with 
women about,

1164
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:18,130
um,
oh,

1165
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:21,320
with the amy schumer about models like 
the idea of a model,

1166
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:22,600
like no one likes that.

1167
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,120
No one likes that.
That's kinda what I mean.

1168
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,240
It's not awful.
I don't want anybody who's really skinny

1169
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,470
to feel bad.
No,

1170
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,220
don't starve yourself to look like that.
I'm not doing anybody any favors,

1171
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,650
but it's very rarely find a guy who was 
like,

1172
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,750
dang,
look at that girl.

1173
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,751
I can see every rib.
It's like trying to take a nap in a 

1174
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:42,751
wooden chair.
Like,

1175
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:42,770
no,
I,

1176
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,360
I've never met a guy who just signed me 
up for that skinny ass model.

1177
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,100
Yeah,
yeah.

1178
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:52,240
The girls have this idea where they need
to be that skinny guys don't like that.

1179
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,730
Well,
it's gay guys who are fashion designers.

1180
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,500
I'm not saying this trait cars aren't,
but a lot of them are gay.

1181
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:58,600
Let's be real.
it's not homophobic to be honest.

1182
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:01,570
There's a lot of gay guys that,
you know,

1183
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,120
obviously they're not looking for hips 
to weight ratio.

1184
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,650
Waist ratio asked to waist ratio because
they're not thinking about fucking them,

1185
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,770
you know,
so they like sledding,

1186
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:14,360
but also,
but also go that cool looks,

1187
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,720
that dress looks cool on that coat 
hanger.

1188
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,840
If we could get a chick to be that 
skinny and thin so it'll look just like 

1189
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,770
that and then toss the blonde wig.
You know what I'm saying?

1190
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,790
Yeah.
So the clothes.

1191
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:26,200
Look the same.
Yeah,

1192
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:28,150
so that's why I couldn't address,
but women,

1193
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,820
they need models with blotter acid.
Women decide that.

1194
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:32,620
Women who looked like that look good 
though.

1195
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,770
That gets weird for other.
Yeah.

1196
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,420
Yeah.
They're told culturally,

1197
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:39,460
you can be told like some tribes in 
africa,

1198
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,840
like are they in Burma?
Those women with a really long necks was

1199
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,980
the women in africa that put the plates 
in their face.

1200
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,110
Yeah.
The bigger the playtime cattle,

1201
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:49,630
you're worth foot binding in China,
you're,

1202
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:49,860
you're.

1203
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,880
You can learn cultures.
Learn what to track.

1204
00:49:52,881 --> 00:49:57,881
Yeah.
I'm just talking about like how weird 

1205
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:57,881
boobs and ask siri.
Yeah,

1206
00:49:57,881 --> 00:49:59,470
well that's the normal route.
That's the dna genetic,

1207
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,260
but there's the cultural route.
What do you think it is?

1208
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,960
What do you think it is?
Why guys are attracted to a bigger butts

1209
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:09,100
and bigger animals?
That's a fact that they breed better.

1210
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,630
Sure.
Larger breast,

1211
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:12,730
larger asked me and she's going to have 
more fat on her body.

1212
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:17,731
She'll be,
she'll be healthier to take care of the 

1213
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:19,411
baby.
The is going to burn off a tremendous 

1214
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:21,481
amount of calories.
You want a healthy woman on a sickly 

1215
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:21,481
person.
You See her ribs,

1216
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:23,200
that'll be unattractive because that 
means she's starving already.

1217
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,970
Cnn saying fricking eating amy

1218
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,480
over here and then thick amy,
but there's a reason why guys like,

1219
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:33,870
ooh,
look at those big ass titties.

1220
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,190
Little ass too.
why is the healthy even animals,

1221
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,910
male animals are attracted.
Round surface,

1222
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:47,290
muscular.
You're also attracted to like a big ass 

1223
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,291
is like the sign of great genetics.
So it's just a reward speed.

1224
00:50:50,301 --> 00:50:53,420
But that power and everything,
but then even more than when a girl gets

1225
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,510
surgery done and gets implants.
I'm sTill cool.

1226
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:57,260
I'm game.
Yeah.

1227
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:58,190
Cool.
Yeah.

1228
00:50:58,191 --> 00:51:00,200
you're letting your system get checked.
Tricked,

1229
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,860
checked.
You're letting your system get tricked.

1230
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,150
Like fake tits.
Yeah.

1231
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:07,640
That's the thing with guys,
fake tits and fake gases.

1232
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,890
They actually do work,
you know,

1233
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,140
we're,
we're so pathetic.

1234
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,360
Like our desire to just analyze it and 
just get our loads out.

1235
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,030
I know we're dealing with like,
um,

1236
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,410
like pretend you were a ship and the 
ship only had so much room for bullets 

1237
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:27,290
on it.
You know,

1238
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:30,080
if you have too many bullets on it,
the fucking ship's going to sink.

1239
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,380
Well,
every day a new shipment of bullets 

1240
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:35,380
arrives and you know what,
alright,

1241
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:37,040
we're just gonna have to fucking be a 
little less choosy with our targets.

1242
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,730
Started shooting into the water in the 
sky.

1243
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,520
You got to get rid of bullets.
That's what it's like being a man.

1244
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:48,680
Being a man is like being on a fuck 
battleship that's constantly receiving a

1245
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:51,230
new ship and uh,
bullets and you're looking at books,

1246
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:53,130
they're looking at the fucking notebook 
and you're like,

1247
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,270
oh,

1248
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:57,340
look at all those bullets we already 
have.

1249
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:58,070
Oh,
alright,

1250
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:03,330
alright everybody on deck,
we've got to start fucking shoot in the 

1251
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:03,330
ocean again.
Everybody on deck,

1252
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:05,230
all hands on deck.
All hands on deck.

1253
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,960
People who don't fire off the rounds on 
their own,

1254
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:11,610
they're not judicious about that.
What happens to them though?

1255
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,630
They get hoodwinked and some shitbag 
relationship with some woman who 

1256
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,630
controls how they come.
You know,

1257
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:21,281
I've,
I've had friends with her girlfriend 

1258
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:21,281
won't let them jerk off,
are you?

1259
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,810
That's crazy.
I'll tell you right now,

1260
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:26,430
my friend comes out and say,
have a good day,

1261
00:52:26,431 --> 00:52:31,431
sir.
We're no longer friends or race my 

1262
00:52:31,431 --> 00:52:34,410
number.
Never call me ever again.

1263
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,740
I went to Alaska and we came across so 
boring with fishing.

1264
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:41,450
Me and my dad lasted one day by the way.
Fishing.

1265
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,960
Why?
Because I don't know how to fish.

1266
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,110
We lost.
We lost every lawyer.

1267
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,640
Every lawyer in one hour the guy goes,
we'll just put an alarm.

1268
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:50,580
Will go,
oh no,

1269
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:52,170
we don't have any more because you lost 
them all.

1270
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,220
Anyway,
I told this story of my past three 

1271
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:57,660
different point I'm making is that we 
found a guy who had an arsenal he had an

1272
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,290
art show have to do with chicks and 
shooting about shooting gun.

1273
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:06,291
Same thing when you have a lot of ammo.
He had crazy amounts of ammo and all 

1274
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:08,390
kinds of machine guns and I said I 
couldn't.

1275
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,830
I couldn't squeeze off enough rounds 
like day after day kick,

1276
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:12,240
kick,
kick,

1277
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:14,100
kick.
I became completely desensitized.

1278
00:53:14,101 --> 00:53:15,240
I was trying to shoot everything.
I was like,

1279
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,280
what's that thing in the water?
Is that an otter?

1280
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,230
That's very different than what we were 
talking about,

1281
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,510
but I see why you can see what you're 
saying.

1282
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,590
See what type of bad correlation you 
were talking about.

1283
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,090
I,
I saw

1284
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,240
a report where they say some guys.
Jesus,

1285
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:29,910
what is that?
Who is that is?

1286
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,160
I can sign me up.
Okay.

1287
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,770
Is that a real ass?
Are you sure?

1288
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:37,410
Are you sure you showed that hasn't been
pumped up.

1289
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:38,550
Yay.
Hey,

1290
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,870
guess what?
I don't care.

1291
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,140
I do not care.
Okay.

1292
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,180
This is my.
So yeah,

1293
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,640
whatever.
Why is welby?

1294
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,500
Let's make it.
She's probably not even real.

1295
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,310
Life is probably a gigantic 
hallucination in the first place.

1296
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,040
Hologram?
Yeah.

1297
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,060
Some sort of mathematical program from 
space where we're on some computer 

1298
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,490
simulation,
but if that is the case,

1299
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:04,491
you creating essentially everything with
your imagination that exists all around 

1300
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,401
you.
It's like you're literally live the 

1301
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:07,730
point I was a.
I saw,

1302
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,770
I saw a report where it says you can 
test trail where some guys are wired 

1303
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,000
where they just can't be faithful.
They're just not wired to be monogamous.

1304
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I wonder if that has anything to do with
the same thing that they're talking 

1305
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,061
about in this,
this story with a sperm being 

1306
00:54:23,061 --> 00:54:26,541
transferred from father to son.
I wonder if that's the case with um,

1307
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,300
because there's some things that they 
say like the children of racists are 

1308
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,440
almost inherently racist,
not inherently racist,

1309
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:36,630
like unavoidably so,
or they can't learn,

1310
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,780
but they will tend to show racist 
tendencies more likely than someone who 

1311
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,380
was an adopted child.
If someone who wasn't racist,

1312
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,670
that's crazy.
Well,

1313
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:49,671
I think they're trying now to figure out
exactly what makeS a human being.

1314
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,680
We don't know yet.
So when you see something like this with

1315
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:57,681
mice and you gotta think what's more 
complex and mice or person or persons 

1316
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:01,910
way more fucking complex.
But if the underlying mechanisms like 

1317
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:05,691
this,
like what they're talking about in mice 

1318
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:05,691
does nothing for me,
but it doesn't because it would.

1319
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:09,980
If you were a guy and you got mugged by 
a black guy and a black guy beat the 

1320
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,551
shit out of you and took your wallet and
then you had a kid and your kid just 

1321
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:14,220
fucking shrieks every time it sees black
people.

1322
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,180
I mean That is real.
That's the same mechanism that would 

1323
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:24,050
keep a look.
There's a reason why rupert sheldrake 

1324
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:24,630
had this analogy about a kids and 
monsters,

1325
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,030
like,
why is every kid afraid of a monster?

1326
00:55:27,031 --> 00:55:32,031
Even a kid who grows up in New York city
like you should be afraid of car 

1327
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:32,031
accidents,
right?

1328
00:55:32,031 --> 00:55:35,870
You should be afraid of floods.
You should be afraid of shit that's 

1329
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,151
real,
but kids are afraid of a monster in the 

1330
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:38,151
dark.
Why?

1331
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:38,910
Because our ancestors get eaten by 
jaguars.

1332
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:40,530
Alright,
we saw way,

1333
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:43,230
way back in the day before they figured 
out houses and spears,

1334
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,160
all that come made the people of today 
and all that stuff's in there.

1335
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,140
That's why some people have a video 
phobia.

1336
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:54,350
Some people have arachnophobia they're 
afraid of snakes or they're aFraid of 

1337
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:54,420
spiders,
and it is fucking paralyzing.

1338
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:57,120
If you've ever seen from an evolutionary
point of view of the state in this book,

1339
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,000
why evolution is true,
why are people afraid of snakes?

1340
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,390
And a lot of people inherently from all,
all over the place,

1341
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:05,450
are afraid of snakes.
you take a fake snake on.

1342
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:09,390
They've done these experiments right?
Where people are killed by cars way more

1343
00:56:09,391 --> 00:56:10,560
often.
Why?

1344
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,970
Well,
primates,

1345
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,910
when they see a snake will climb a tree,
almost like they're afraid of snakes,

1346
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,830
so they think it's.
They think it's.

1347
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:19,230
That's why they're still here.
They think it's an evolutionary memory.

1348
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,220
Yeah.
that,

1349
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,730
that,
that human beings have carried from when

1350
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,650
you know back back,

1351
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,250
really.
They did a whole fucking research where 

1352
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,640
a guy listened.
Snakes are scary as share reason though.

1353
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:40,360
I know he's panicking for a car wreck.
No.

1354
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,480
You got into this thing where you're 
trying to anti intellectualize the whole

1355
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:45,710
situation and you like this is your 
watch.

1356
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,200
Esco.
No,

1357
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,050
not at all,
Man.

1358
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:51,710
Not at all.
No,

1359
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,760
not at all.
There's a reason because a rattle snake 

1360
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:56,760
will bite you.
correct.

1361
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:56,950
Shake his sale,
bite you.

1362
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:01,840
How often have you seen ralph not even 
know that I don't even know that name.

1363
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:02,650
Date.
Declamatory.

1364
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,620
Almost immediately they see when they 
bite you.

1365
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,680
Right?
But they don't know that we're talking 

1366
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:10,680
about things that have never been 
exposed to snakes.

1367
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,040
They don't have a book to read.
People that don't have videos to watch.

1368
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:13,330
Just see us,
man.

1369
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,930
I saY see a snake with these huge things
and they don't know what that thing is.

1370
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:22,870
It looks like a stick that people have.
You don't touch a snake.

1371
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:30,160
monkey of common sense.
Brennan one sense reminiscences most 

1372
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,110
likely rented common sense was be,
uh,

1373
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:36,120
be.
Be afraid way more afraid of cars 

1374
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,120
because they kill way more people a 
year.

1375
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:36,120
Then do snakes.
Right?

1376
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,590
But people we know,
we know cars.

1377
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,520
People.
No snakes.

1378
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,520
Not really what I'm saying.
That's why we're terrifying.

1379
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,830
What are you talking about?
People don't know.

1380
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:45,880
Snakes.
No,

1381
00:57:45,881 --> 00:57:47,290
they don't.
Wait a minute.

1382
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,020
Come on man.
People don't know what a snake is.

1383
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:53,950
Saw snakes taking my yard two days ago.
Well,

1384
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,470
good for you joe.
You around rattle snakes all the time,

1385
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,080
but everybody has an la la.
if you have a yard,

1386
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:03,500
it's very possible that snakes are.
They don't know how many routes.

1387
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:08,510
Thanks sir.
Zero rattle snake in your car.

1388
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,750
Trust me.
You might not see a rattlesnake,

1389
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:16,770
but they're out there,
but that's probably a very small 

1390
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:16,770
population in your neighborhood there.

1391
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:17,860
The poInt I'm making is you're missing 
the point.

1392
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,390
Evolutionary scientists have to say,
I've,

1393
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:22,450
I've,
I've realized that we have a natural and

1394
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:27,510
a human being seemed to have universally
have a phobia of snakes and things.

1395
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:29,160
Hold on,
hold on,

1396
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,320
hold on,
hold on,

1397
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,520
hold on.
They have a natural phobia of snakes and

1398
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:36,040
what that is probably as an evolutionary
memory,

1399
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:41,041
and I'm talking,
joe was talking about how you have you 

1400
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:43,930
create fear memory through generations 
and that is an example of that.

1401
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,040
Whether or not you know you're afraid.
Snakes.

1402
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:49,360
What the point is is that there are 
other things in life you could be.

1403
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:54,480
You should be way more afraid of him.
People are not because we don't have as 

1404
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,181
long a memory of it,
and that's the argument from the 

1405
00:58:57,181 --> 00:58:57,370
argument.
I get both arguments then.

1406
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,800
Why are people scared of aliens?
Well,

1407
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:04,801
because they're scared of the unknown.
We're not just only scared of things 

1408
00:59:04,801 --> 00:59:06,580
that we see that are scary because our 
grandfathers got bitten by one.

1409
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:09,340
We're also scared of the unknown.
We're scared of the dark period.

1410
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:11,530
I think it's a good theory for sure,
and it makes sense,

1411
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:12,910
but I think there's also some things 
where,

1412
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:13,960
listen,
you know,

1413
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,300
if a predator walks in my room,
I'm be like,

1414
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:17,230
hey man,
what's up?

1415
00:59:17,231 --> 00:59:18,280
Let's hang out.
No,

1416
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:18,610
no,
no.

1417
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:21,590
My children,
when you go like this to children,

1418
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,800
they start crying little babies.
That scared me.

1419
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:29,890
Why though?
Because it's a memory of being eaten to 

1420
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:29,890
memory,
of being eaten.

1421
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:30,830
So what they found is even infants,
when you go,

1422
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:33,140
when you bury your teeth and go like 
this with your hands,

1423
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,560
you go and grout,
low noises for infants.

1424
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:39,560
That's why when men come into a room,
a lot of times children when they hear a

1425
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:44,561
low voice,
especially when the person's talking 

1426
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,631
loud man,
they immediately are way more afraid of 

1427
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:47,390
that than they are of of a woman with a 
high voice.

1428
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:49,430
Why is that?
Why did they start crying?

1429
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:50,800
It's strange men.
That is a.

1430
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,600
That is according to a lot of 
evolutionary biologist.

1431
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,960
That is a memory that you were actually 
born with.

1432
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,370
Not in.
What's that called?

1433
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,480
Instinct,
right?

1434
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:04,481
I mean it's the type of incident or the 
babies are scared because the giant do 

1435
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:04,481
talking all loud.

1436
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,020
You just chalk it up to that.
They're not afraid of teenagers.

1437
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:10,850
Why?
babies are afraid of a lot of shit.

1438
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:12,080
They're afraid of things don't make 
sense.

1439
01:00:12,081 --> 01:00:14,240
Like a ladies hat.
The fucking giant feathers.

1440
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,940
They freak out because it's to get the 
point you're making and I think it's 

1441
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,290
true,
but I also think sometimes you just know

1442
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,100
I.
You know what I think?

1443
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:24,350
I think it's not either or.
I think it's both,

1444
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:29,510
but what they're saying in this study 
and memorize what's been proven in this 

1445
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,460
study though is pretty unavoidable.
if they're.

1446
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:36,461
They're detecting this stress response 
to a very specific smell that they've 

1447
01:00:36,461 --> 01:00:39,941
created that they associated with 
electric shocks and then the the 

1448
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:42,110
children have that same reaction.
That's pretty much proof,

1449
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,700
but then how's this go back?
The guy being faithful was saying is the

1450
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:51,701
same thing with racism.
I was saying that there's things that 

1451
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:52,370
are even useless.

1452
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:57,370
Things that are passed on from 
generation to generation and I think at 

1453
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:01,541
least at one point in time there was a 
time where the human race has probably 

1454
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:06,701
in jeopardy and it was probably 
ridiculous for one guy to have sex with 

1455
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:09,890
one woman and hope that the race was 
going to keep going.

1456
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:15,190
Everybody fucked as much as they could 
because half the babies got eaten by 

1457
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,350
jaguars.
I mean,

1458
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:20,351
what are the odds of a fleshy little 
fucking shitty designed human disease?

1459
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:24,320
Survive animals,
wolves,

1460
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:27,950
fucking everything you until you figure 
out weapons.

1461
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:30,710
Then you have to band together and that 
doesn't work out.

1462
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:35,980
Look,
it's a hard road for a long time for 

1463
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,981
people to make it this far.
Now it's so out of control that we're 

1464
01:01:38,981 --> 01:01:42,851
overwhelming.
The population is overwhelming the 

1465
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:44,870
resources of the planet and will 
continue to grow at this rate or have an

1466
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,660
exponential rate,
but a long time ago,

1467
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:49,550
man,
it was tough to keep people alive.

1468
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,970
During the roman times.
It was a 50 percent infant mortality 

1469
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:54,970
rate.
Fifty percent.

1470
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,830
If you had two kids,
one of them was going to die for sure,

1471
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,130
and you just had to deal with that.
They're just having sex with whoever it 

1472
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:03,130
was.
Cool.

1473
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:04,880
They were mad dog in it because they 
were trying to keep the race alive.

1474
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:10,060
You know,
one of the things that they found when 

1475
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:10,130
they were going over the dead sea 
scrolls was that they,

1476
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,600
the dead sea scrolls is the most,
the oldest stories of the bible that are

1477
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:19,601
known.
It's the only form of the bible that's 

1478
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,001
written in aramaic,
and they found that in these scrolls in 

1479
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:25,300
Iran,
it was written on animal skins and left 

1480
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,700
in these caves and these,
these ceramic pots.

1481
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,120
They found that a big part of What they 
were concerned with was fertility 

1482
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,561
rituals.
They were concerned with making sure 

1483
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:37,260
that they breed,
making sure that they carry on.

1484
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:38,010
I mean,
this is,

1485
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:40,590
we're talking like thousands and 
thousands of years ago.

1486
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,750
We.
That's nothing though.

1487
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:47,751
When you think about the fact that 
humans in this form of essentially been 

1488
01:02:47,751 --> 01:02:50,601
around for close to a million years,
so for a long time it was a hard 

1489
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:54,491
scrabble life where we might not,
might not fucking make it and the only 

1490
01:02:54,491 --> 01:02:58,101
way we could make it is if we protect 
our territory and fuck every chick we 

1491
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:00,480
can,
which is shooting and to everybody.

1492
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:02,190
So miguel was like,
let's do this.

1493
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,980
Those are the men that made it,
the men that made it,

1494
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,460
the humans that made it were the ones 
that had this evolutionary trait.

1495
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:09,990
And it conversely,
by the way,

1496
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:11,610
and you're saying that trades carried 
on.

1497
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,500
Yes.
Well that trade exists in primates,

1498
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:15,870
but not.
I don't think it'll all.

1499
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:20,930
I don't think to all.
I guess some still have it know it 

1500
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:20,930
exists in all primates.

1501
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:24,860
Every single primary,
the only primate that it's ever been 

1502
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,220
observed to even try to be monogamous as
a human being.

1503
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:31,430
All the monkeys,
the gorillas have harems and the 

1504
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,750
gorillas have such a domination over the
females that the females never cheat.

1505
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,340
So because of this,
the grills,

1506
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:38,820
dicks have shrunk the size of an inch.
Gorillas have tiny,

1507
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,960
tiny little ball and the little chimp 
pitches or whole ours chimps are sluts.

1508
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:48,180
So chimps have giant balls and giant 
eagle,

1509
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,230
but not as big as humans.
Human beings are the most promiscuous.

1510
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:57,260
And there's a direct correlation between
female promiscuity and male testicular 

1511
01:03:57,260 --> 01:03:58,260
size.
Really?

1512
01:03:58,261 --> 01:04:00,360
Yes.
The bigger the balls,

1513
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,000
the more likely the male is surrounded 
by a bunch of hula.

1514
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:10,360
The dick.
So your body recognizes this and the 

1515
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,320
the.
The competition builds up so you,

1516
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:13,650
you come more,
you build up more.

1517
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:18,790
There Was a bunch of faulty conclusion 
reached by a book called sperm wars and 

1518
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:22,881
this book is basically,
there's a lot of junk science attached 

1519
01:04:22,881 --> 01:04:25,941
to it and a lot of it was about these 
killer sperm that attacks sperm and 

1520
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:29,931
killed them,
but they've never been able to 

1521
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:31,581
conclusively prove that sperm have any 
properties other than trying to get 

1522
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:31,590
someone pregnant.

1523
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:36,740
There's never been proven that their 
sperm that are attacking other sperm or 

1524
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,580
any mechanism which they kill the sperm.
But what it has been proven is your dick

1525
01:04:38,581 --> 01:04:40,830
is shaped a certain way.
Okay.

1526
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:44,500
And the big fat head at the end is a 
goddamn plunger.

1527
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,220
and like the evolutionary design,
a dude has got a little dickhead,

1528
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,360
ever see a porn and the guy's got a 
little head is poor bastard.

1529
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,500
WhaT are you going to do with that 
thing?

1530
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,140
Exactly.
Because evolutionary,

1531
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:58,920
we look at that the same way we look at 
a big ass or big tits.

1532
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:01,350
Like that's not a good design.
Like look at that little fat,

1533
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:03,570
fat dick with a little head.
You're a mess.

1534
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:06,110
You're not plunging a can.
My,

1535
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:06,950
my,
my girl,

1536
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,980
I'm not,
I'm not jealous.

1537
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:11,680
You're plunging.
You'rE using this big fat dick head.

1538
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:16,730
The bigger,
the better to squirt out all the other 

1539
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:17,100
dudes sperm.
And then with the hood of the books.

1540
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,240
Hooker.
Yeah.

1541
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:21,820
It pulls it out and then you shoot.
Your own is intense.

1542
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:26,850
It's intense.
But that's the design of the human is 

1543
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:26,980
the plunger.
Yeah.

1544
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:28,880
Everyone's book.
And that's,

1545
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,050
that's really.
Are there any anteaters in here?

1546
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,810
Do you want to have a hood hanging over 
me?

1547
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:38,320
no,
believe it is as well and tortured,

1548
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:40,450
but in england most of them have the 
hood.

1549
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:41,260
I didn't know that.
Well,

1550
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:46,261
it should be because it's gentlemen 
mutation really is because my coach tony

1551
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:49,270
jeffries in santa monica,
he's having a baby.

1552
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:49,960
I said,
man,

1553
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:51,640
if it's a boy,
you're going to cut the hood off,

1554
01:05:51,641 --> 01:05:53,150
right?
Like it's weird to leave it on.

1555
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:54,820
And he goes,
no.

1556
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,360
He goes,
who kissed her hood?

1557
01:05:56,430 --> 01:05:57,640
Off I go,
uh,

1558
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:02,940
everybody.
Haven't you ever seen the scene that 

1559
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,790
you're better at it can't.
No studies,

1560
01:06:03,791 --> 01:06:08,460
no studies whatsoever.
All junk science shit under the,

1561
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,210
you know,
a lot of religious thing,

1562
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:10,480
right?

1563
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,070
They taught it a little bit of a 
religious thing,

1564
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:17,071
but it's also,
I believe that they're preparing for a 

1565
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:19,561
giant backlash of babies have had their 
dick sliced because if circumcision was 

1566
01:06:19,561 --> 01:06:21,910
proven to be genital mutilation and 
stopped,

1567
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,840
then guess what?
You opened the door for suits.

1568
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,960
If everybody just decides to go ape shit
on the american medical association or 

1569
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,280
anybody who allowed essentially a non 
beneficial genital mutilation to norm to

1570
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:40,050
be the norm or real.
Do you know what kind of backlash?

1571
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,610
I mean,
this is not a propaganda or rather a,

1572
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,090
a,
um,

1573
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,950
a,
a conspiracy theory,

1574
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,540
sort of a,
an idea.

1575
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,720
This is the reality of what's going on.
Genital mutilation on a wide scale 

1576
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,600
that's completely unnecessary,
that has no health benefits.

1577
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,660
What,
what's weird is in a locked room,

1578
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:57,810
nfl college locker room,
if you got a hood,

1579
01:06:57,811 --> 01:06:58,720
you were the outcast.

1580
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,060
He made fun of your fund.
Your dick.

1581
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:02,950
Yeah,
but tony was saying england,

1582
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,290
if you didn't have a hood,
you got made fun of.

1583
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:06,670
I bet it's weird,
right?

1584
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,750
Well,
one's natural hair.

1585
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:08,890
That's not right.
Yeah.

1586
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:13,891
Well,
it's also about with the plates in the 

1587
01:07:13,891 --> 01:07:16,951
lip and all that shit.
It's just whatever the culture decides 

1588
01:07:16,951 --> 01:07:19,681
is the norm and the culture's decided 
that cutting your dick to her house to 

1589
01:07:19,681 --> 01:07:24,410
her of course.
So you have a better chance of not 

1590
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:25,760
contacting like a gonorrhea and things.
I think that's.

1591
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:30,400
I think that's all.
There is no medical society in the world

1592
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:34,630
that has recognized any real health 
benefits to circumcision.

1593
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,540
It's all bullshit.
Not only that,

1594
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:39,850
the risks include infection,
hemorrhage,

1595
01:07:39,851 --> 01:07:41,860
scarring,
difficulty urinating,

1596
01:07:41,861 --> 01:07:45,130
loss of part or all of the penis,
and even death.

1597
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:50,430
Circumcision complications can also and 
do occur even if the best in the best 

1598
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:55,141
clinical settings.
Early producers back in a little too 

1599
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:55,141
smiley.
Oh,

1600
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:58,050
there,
you got some hoods that more than maybe 

1601
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:02,430
this decade has more than one baby has.
This decade has died in New York because

1602
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,070
the rabbis who,
uh,

1603
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:10,090
these really heavy religious jewish 
dudes insist on using the moyle who uses

1604
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:15,091
the traditional method of circumcision 
where they circumcise the baby and then 

1605
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,010
suck his penis to stop the

1606
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,010
bleeding.
And these rabbis have had herpes and 

1607
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:24,311
given her [inaudible] to the babies,
they refused to stop this because this 

1608
01:08:24,311 --> 01:08:28,760
is a religious procedure.
There's moyles online rabbis online.

1609
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:33,761
they're doinG these videos on like the 
jewish name for what that procedure is 

1610
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:39,010
and how it's written in the torah.
And this is why you should do it that 

1611
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:39,080
way.
And this is why it's a traditional way.

1612
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:40,460
Yeah.
Could you imagine?

1613
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:42,800
Here's the task that the universe has 
given you.

1614
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:46,010
Like we're on a,
we're all following different patterns.

1615
01:08:46,011 --> 01:08:47,900
Mean brian,
you've got a nice golf shirt on.

1616
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:50,210
I have converse all stars well following
patterns,

1617
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:51,560
right?
Here's the pattern.

1618
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:56,830
The pattern is there's a fucking ancient
religion that was written back when 

1619
01:08:56,830 --> 01:09:00,671
people thought the world was flat.
All the fucking rules are written down 

1620
01:09:00,671 --> 01:09:02,270
on animal skins and fucking chicken 
scratch that you can't even read today,

1621
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,490
and it says you could suck baby dicks.

1622
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:09,670
You cut their dicks and then you suck 
them in humanity if that didn't exist 

1623
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:12,380
and you try.
Does that true?

1624
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:17,820
Absolutely.
I will show you a video you want to see 

1625
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:21,341
a video.
Is that in the video with spraying 

1626
01:09:21,341 --> 01:09:24,050
explains about a sucking a penis after 
circumcision?

1627
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:27,740
It's one of the most thing.
The internet or this is a no,

1628
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:28,160
no,
no,

1629
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:28,520
no,
no.

1630
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,620
He told me to.
I talked to rob about it.

1631
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:35,621
Who was raised incredibly religious.
Are he studied the torah 12 hours a day 

1632
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,490
and he was.
He watched all this shit and he said,

1633
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:39,410
yeah,
what the guy is saying is true.

1634
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:44,870
I don't know that it happened in the 
things that John Duran who wrote the 

1635
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:45,440
paleo manifesto,
did my podcast,

1636
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:48,500
talked about was the old testament with 
the obsession of washing.

1637
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:54,200
You know,
he calls moses the first 

1638
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:54,200
microbiologists,
the idea of a guy who they were obsessed

1639
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,400
with keeping things clean.

1640
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:00,550
I don't know.
Find out if the guys have been talking 

1641
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:00,550
about it being read the descriptions or 
listened to it.

1642
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:04,780
We got to talking about sucking on a 
penis to up circumcision.

1643
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:07,070
Rabbi sucking penis.
I bet you'll doctor.

1644
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,080
I don't have any kids.
If I did and dr touching my kid's a 

1645
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,080
dick.
He's getting.

1646
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,180
Well dr jack his dick to make sure 
everything's okay.

1647
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,280
This guy,
first of all,

1648
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:19,130
he's not a doctor.
He's a religious nut.

1649
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,590
He's a cult member.
That's what that guy is.

1650
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,320
I mean,
if,

1651
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:26,000
if there was no religious extreme,
not extreme at all.

1652
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:31,060
If there was no religion,
if religion didn't exist and some guy 

1653
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,391
came along and dressed like a fucking 
spaceman and wanting to suck baby 

1654
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:34,391
dick's,
he'd be like,

1655
01:10:34,391 --> 01:10:35,360
well,
that guy's in a cult,

1656
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,310
but because it's around for a thousand 
years,

1657
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,120
it's not a cult.
Oh,

1658
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,110
it's a religion.

1659
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:44,290
Needs a fucking cult.
Anytime you can get people to adhere to 

1660
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:47,741
an ideology that you have to look to the
stars to find your fucking answers in 

1661
01:10:47,741 --> 01:10:52,340
some magical man who has rules like not 
mixing meat with milk and coupled with a

1662
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,740
lot of those rules.
John duran,

1663
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,770
who just wrote this book,
a lot of those rules were we're very 

1664
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,731
practical backnet not eating sugar 
because because you didn't want to kiss 

1665
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:06,151
the kenosis exact sexual laws were know 
the restrictions on sex where just 

1666
01:11:06,151 --> 01:11:07,160
because you didn't want to catch 
syphilis and things back in the day.

1667
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:10,130
So there's no cutting and baby dick 
sense.

1668
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,460
I don't know anything about cutting,
cutting,

1669
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,950
sucking baby dick,
all that.

1670
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:14,120
Does

1671
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:19,120
he know that comes from moses when he 
cut his own penis to show his serbians 

1672
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,611
to god in the old testament.
That's a very weird way to show your 

1673
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:23,430
speaking.
So you haven't had a friend breakup.

1674
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:28,450
Dick moses.
I heard of that before I've ever had to 

1675
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,240
rush into the emergency room.
Does it ever get fixed?

1676
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:32,360
Totally.
Or is it always kind of hooked it kinda.

1677
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,870
Yeah.
Curves to the left a little bit.

1678
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:38,900
Wow.
His balls literally internal bleeding 

1679
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:38,900
filled up.
Oh look.

1680
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,590
Like purple gecko skin.
That's why you've got to be careful with

1681
01:11:40,591 --> 01:11:45,591
crazy bitches.
You got to get double under hooks on 

1682
01:11:45,591 --> 01:11:45,591
crazy bitch.
Crazy bitches riding you.

1683
01:11:45,591 --> 01:11:46,710
You gotta,
you gotta hold their ass.

1684
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:47,300
But like,
uh,

1685
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,560
from,
you know how you got to go?

1686
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,980
You can't just do this because if you do
this,

1687
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:57,110
there's too much lateral.
There's room for doubt.

1688
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:00,150
Gable grip.
The lower hips.

1689
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,040
My buddy is huge.
You've met this guy.

1690
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:04,290
No,
you can say his name on there.

1691
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,970
These guys.
Sixty six to 70 shred runaways.

1692
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:08,690
Wait.
People are gonna.

1693
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:10,160
Figure out who they are.
They will figure it out.

1694
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,390
So he's like,
he tells me,

1695
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:12,900
he goes,
bro,

1696
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,910
this girl wants it so hard.
He was,

1697
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:16,860
I don't know what to do.
I knew how hard he goes,

1698
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:21,890
I'm going to film it next time.
So he films it and it's one of the most 

1699
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:24,750
disturbing videos I've ever seen.
I mean,

1700
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:29,751
he's getting ear like why am like dang,
week later he calls me up,

1701
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,310
dude,
get over here.

1702
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,220
I rush over.
What's the.

1703
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,820
He's on the ground,
but button naked.

1704
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:36,540
What's the matter?
He goes,

1705
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:39,060
that video I showed you.
I was backing up,

1706
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:41,360
missed my penis,
hit her ass,

1707
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,390
broke his dick.
Oh my god.

1708
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,890
So thIs is what I tell them.
I go,

1709
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,570
this is an easy fix,
right?

1710
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:49,180
I,
I've,

1711
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,120
I'm,
I have no idea how to hand this.

1712
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,200
Dr schaub.
Yeah,

1713
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,220
dr.
Schaub in the house.

1714
01:12:53,221 --> 01:12:54,450
Big brown.shop
in the house.

1715
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,880
I know this is easy fix.
I'm going to step out of the room.

1716
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,920
You put a little porno on,
you get a wreck.

1717
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,170
We're just going to line it right back.
Right back up.

1718
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:05,730
Just like you fix a broken nose.
That's a great strategy,

1719
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,840
right?
Right.

1720
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,850
Makes sense.
That's a great room.

1721
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:12,660
Ten minutes later I hear,
I'm like,

1722
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:14,580
oh shit.
So I called my doctor buddy.

1723
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,360
I'm like,

1724
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:20,770

1725
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:20,770

1728
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:27,350
Let me see your goes man.

1729
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:28,230
grapefruit and it looks like ghetto 
purple dotted.

1730
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:29,840
Oh,

bleeding.

1733
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:36,160
And uh,
people thought we were just to gays.

1734
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,280
Gay men.
Big dudes.

1735
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:44,760
I'm not making this up.
I wish I could make this up.

1736
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:47,460
He straddled in a gurney like this,
right?

1737
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,000
He's like this things hanging down.
It's filling up,

1738
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:53,220

I'm cool with that,
right?

1742
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:02,670
Legs up and straub if this is his broken
penis.

1743
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,090
This dude's like this.

1744
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,760

1752
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:23,980
Or yeah,

1753
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:25,600

1754
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:28,000
he's grabbing a man.
It's insane how badly it goes.

1755
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:28,620
Whoa,

1756
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:28,950

1757
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:36,050
Nurse physically touched his penis,

1759

And he goes,

1760
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:49,410
wow,
I need to get the name of that guy 

1761
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:50,761
because that is not code here that the 
white jacket,

1762
01:14:56,530 --> 01:15:01,530
$500.
My wife has got an app on his phone and 

1763
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:01,530
when anybody gets administered in the 
hospital with a broken dick,

1764
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,520
you fucking shows up,
puts on his lap,

1765
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,250
dances.
This urologist comes in.

1766
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,690
I go,
I gotta be honest,

1767
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:12,691
man.
How did you get into basically majoring 

1768
01:15:12,691 --> 01:15:15,571
in dick's?
Like what role did you go down and he 

1769
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:16,450
Said in Egypt or someplace in Egypt 
where um,

1770
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,430
there's a religion,
they might be muslim,

1771
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:19,840
I'm not sure,
but they get erections.

1772
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:22,830
They think it's dealt the sentence work 
and they break their debts.

1773
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,060
Not in,
that's not muslim religion.

1774
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:26,050
There might be.
Well no,

1775
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:29,890
it's an extremist muslim.
He was saying it just sounds like a dumb

1776
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:33,340
person who,
whatever it is,

1777
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:36,760
it's another crazy cause he was saying 
he and these guys need help,

1778
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:38,980
so he got into it because he was exposed
to it.

1779
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,040
So these guys think it's satan's work.
The devil's work,

1780
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,030
they get erections.
Snap their day.

1781
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,510
A lot of them died from internal 
bleeding.

1782
01:15:46,511 --> 01:15:48,130
He had,
they brushed doctors down there.

1783
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,740
So most urologists go down to this part 
of the world.

1784
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:52,870
That's a fix it guy.
Anyways,

1785
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:55,330
my buddy,
my buddy got a break.

1786
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:57,190
He's all good now.
The updated my friend.

1787
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:02,200
All good.
They give him pills so he couldn't get 

1788
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:02,200
an erection for six weeks and his dick 
was in a splint.

1789
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,090
Really?
A splints.

1790
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,380
Splints.
It just has a hook.

1791
01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:08,710
Yeah.
So I'd hook or a big one a.

1792
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,510
Oh,
it's definitely knows.

1793
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,880
What's that operation.
You can cut the tendon and it makes your

1794
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,920
dick,
but it's nice Florida around your 

1795
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:17,920
tickets.
harden.

1796
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:18,610
it goes straight down.
Sometimes.

1797
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,060
That was the complication that.
How much longer could it make you got to

1798
01:16:22,061 --> 01:16:23,120
jerk off downward.

1799
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:28,140
Huh?
How much longer could it make that 

1800
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,140
small?
Yeah,

1801
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,360
and institutions,
you can cut the tendon that will 

1802
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:32,360
actually create more length here,
dick,

1803
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,510
but the problem was that the,
for whatever reason,

1804
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:38,210
the tenant is one of the instrumental 
tenants and keeping it very hot,

1805
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,320
you know,
rec.

1806
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:42,070
You would thInk they would build some 
sort of implant for that.

1807
01:16:42,071 --> 01:16:43,780
By now they have implants,
root thing else.

1808
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:48,810
People are so fucking weird.
You're so weird that we'd be willing to 

1809
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:49,170
cut or a dick to stretch it out and you 
know guys,

1810
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,180
if you could get fake.
Dick's is like the way we're going to 

1811
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:54,180
get fake tits guys will be walking 
around with fit 15 inch dick.

1812
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:58,620
No,
they wouldn't because women wouldn't 

1813
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:58,620
want it.
See,

1814
01:16:58,620 --> 01:16:58,620
there's a big difference.
That's why guys aren't allowed to wear a

1815
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,910
pays and guys and girls wore wigs.
We don't give a fuck.

1816
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:04,540
Girls can have fake tits.
Who cares if a guy has fake shoulders?

1817
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:08,830
That guy was walking around with fucking
fake shoulders and you're like,

1818
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:09,920
oh my god,
I love your shoulders.

1819
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:10,080
anyway,

1820
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:15,190
scorned scorns.
They're like fucking fake taste like 

1821
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:15,190
that.
They sell shirts like that.

1822
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:15,190
Yeah,
they do.

1823
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:19,500
They sell shares.
You have looked into it.

1824
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:25,390
I did a world's dumbest and they had and
it was one of the inventions that they 

1825
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,681
sell them and well that's theirs.
They have pants that women wear that 

1826
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:29,660
like suck everything tight to their ass 
banks.

1827
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:30,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1828
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:33,350
That's what made me millions,
but in that crazy,

1829
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:38,351
like wilmington have fake tits when we 
can have a lot of fake things are 

1830
01:17:38,351 --> 01:17:38,351
extensions,
but it does not bother me at all.

1831
01:17:38,351 --> 01:17:41,570
We don't care because we're trying to 
fuck as many of them as possible.

1832
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:45,020
That's what the monkey dna wants to do.
So when the,

1833
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,970
when the monkey has no problem wIth the 
fake tits,

1834
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,380
the like,
that's great for now let's go.

1835
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,650
Whether they like it sticks out the way.
I like it.

1836
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:53,700
But you know,
like your,

1837
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,080
your dna so scrambled.
Whereas the woman looks at you with your

1838
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:59,510
fake shoulders like,
oh this week,

1839
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:04,540
shit,
mother fucker can't even grow a shallow 

1840
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:04,540
women.
Oh,

1841
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,810
you're not coming in.
Make women want you to get the job done.

1842
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:11,510
They want utility.
Men likes things that are static,

1843
01:18:11,511 --> 01:18:13,370
that look good,
that we can grab and fuck,

1844
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:15,000
but women need to.
I mean,

1845
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:17,370
I'm saying evolutionarily you,
I would imagine women need.

1846
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:22,570
You got to go out there and actually 
hunt something while I'm taking care of 

1847
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,241
the kids and if you've got fake 
shoulders are going to help you catch 

1848
01:18:25,241 --> 01:18:26,180
that deer.
You're like a weak person is not able to

1849
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:31,780
completely look at reality,
but you can see a hot chick with a 

1850
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:33,650
pretty crappy dude.
You know what I'm saying?

1851
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:37,340
You never get to see red plate looking 
dude with a real fat,

1852
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,270
ugly girl.

1853
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,230
That's true,
but you will.

1854
01:18:39,231 --> 01:18:41,750
You do if he's gay,
but you do see you.

1855
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:46,751
You also see like these guys that are 
with these girls and the girl is like 

1856
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:51,490
way better looking than the guy younger.
Probably sugar daddy.

1857
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:56,540
Yeah.
You see that a lot of times women are 

1858
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:59,021
attracted.
I would never date to go to something 

1859
01:18:59,021 --> 01:19:01,300
like guys,
we're really good at something and he's 

1860
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:01,300
not that good.
Looking.

1861
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,820
Women find that very attractive.
So you get a guy who someone's older and

1862
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:06,510
older.
No,

1863
01:19:06,511 --> 01:19:09,030
I mean if you're like really funny,
you got really good skill,

1864
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:14,031
man,
you can still get those young girls 

1865
01:19:14,031 --> 01:19:16,160
there are wrong because billy who works 
at the arcade,

1866
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:21,161
who's jack has no skill,
she's going to take billy that works at 

1867
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:22,400
the Arcade over you as a skill.
You say that,

1868
01:19:22,401 --> 01:19:24,980
but then you see david spade with a 
dime.

1869
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,160
yeah.
You know,

1870
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,320
becauSe he's funny and he's also rich 
and famous and rich,

1871
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:31,500
you know,
good at some famous,

1872
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,690
tough,
famous,

1873
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:35,770
different names,
different chicken head there.

1874
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:37,610
A lot of guys.
Chicken heads coming there.

1875
01:19:37,611 --> 01:19:40,040
A lot of guys.
Not chicken heads.

1876
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,960
What's that mean?
Chicken heads like girls,

1877
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:43,310
just fame.
You know girl,

1878
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,560
there's been beaus you know what I'm 
saying?

1879
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:46,610
Like oh,
chicken,

1880
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:51,760
chicken heads.
But you said that as if we would know 

1881
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:51,760
what you mean.
Oh yeah.

1882
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,620
I thought you would do.
I said ma'am,

1883
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:54,410
chicken and I've heard him use the 
expression before,

1884
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:57,860
but it fresh chicken head is a female 
who likes cock,

1885
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:02,120
a female as giving head bobbing.
this is in the urban dictionary,

1886
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,510
a dancing up and down like a chicken and
it's a dance move.

1887
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:10,810
Well,
brendan shops got his own definition of 

1888
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:10,810
chicken heads.
I get it,

1889
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:12,510
but if a guy can play the guitar really 
well and he's not that good looking,

1890
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:13,230
he's getting laid.

1891
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,380
Amy schumer had a strange thing we were 
talking about last night,

1892
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:21,381
being a girl like she was talking about 
how being a girl sucks because you have 

1893
01:20:21,381 --> 01:20:24,190
an expiration date on the time where 
people want to fuck you for sure,

1894
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,720
and it's running through a clock that's 
running from the moment you realize that

1895
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:30,610
sex is important til nobody wants to 
fuck you anymore.

1896
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:31,290
Ready?
Go.

1897
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:32,190
Tick tock,
tick tock,

1898
01:20:32,191 --> 01:20:34,350
tick tock.
I heard my grandmother talking about how

1899
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:39,351
devastating it was.
The first time she realized men stopped 

1900
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:39,630
looking at her.
she said she.

1901
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:44,660
She realized she was finally old when 
she walked by a group of construction 

1902
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:48,060
workers.
One of them looked up and she said that 

1903
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,020
was when she was with other older women 
and they all went,

1904
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:50,670
yep,
I remember that day too.

1905
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,290
My heart broke heartbrokeN.
I was about 15 or 16.

1906
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,640
Man,
that's a tough.

1907
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:00,720
That's a tough day at some girl.
Tell me.

1908
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:05,721
Still don't,
don't waste my time because I'm in my 

1909
01:21:05,721 --> 01:21:07,980
prime.
I have three more years left in my time.

1910
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,160
I had a girl tell me a wasted wasted a 
year of my life with you when I didn't 

1911
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:13,920
want to keep dating and was like,
okay,

1912
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,920
now I got you.
Just totally let me know that I made the

1913
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:21,921
right to say that I thought we dated and
went to dinner and had a lot of fun and 

1914
01:21:22,081 --> 01:21:24,750
I thought like all my other friends,
I enjoyed your company.

1915
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,920
I didn'T know that you were investing.
We're fucking their twenties,

1916
01:21:28,921 --> 01:21:31,590
you Know,
I was like 23 or something like that.

1917
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,060
Jesus christ,
this is crazy.

1918
01:21:34,061 --> 01:21:36,680
A lot of girls are raised to think,
you know,

1919
01:21:36,681 --> 01:21:41,681
you've got it.
I'm even my own mother who's a really 

1920
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:41,681
smart woman,
said to my,

1921
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:41,700
my sister,
when she went to get her mba,

1922
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,110
she went,
hey lIsten,

1923
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:44,370
you're going to get your mba.

1924
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,160
That's great.
Work on your mrs as well.

1925
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,280
You know what's on your mItten,
mrs.

1926
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:54,400
Oh god.
I tell brian all the what we talked 

1927
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,341
about this,
talking about relationships all the 

1928
01:21:58,341 --> 01:21:58,341
time.
I'll talk to brian like,

1929
01:21:58,341 --> 01:21:58,341
man,
I'm a little stressed out.

1930
01:21:58,341 --> 01:22:00,690
Should I be having kids are doing 
something here,

1931
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:02,970
showing me coming home and a life making
food and stuff,

1932
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,080
and he goes,
no man.

1933
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:06,960
That's what society wants you to do.
That's the norm.

1934
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:11,961
That's what everyone wants you to have 
this conversation with people who asked 

1935
01:22:11,961 --> 01:22:14,100
me because they know I love having kids 
and they'd go,

1936
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,660
do you think that everyone should have a
kid?

1937
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:17,370
If I didn't have a kid,
would I still be happy?

1938
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:18,990
And I said,
absolutely not.

1939
01:22:18,991 --> 01:22:20,340
Everybody shouldn't have a kId.
I go,

1940
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,950
you can be a great person.
Have a great life,

1941
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:24,750
infect a great amount of people around 
you.

1942
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:28,530
Be a joy to be around.
Contribute every step of the way.

1943
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:32,010
Be a a great example.
Inspire people and never have kids.

1944
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,400
Hundred percent.
You don't have to hunt.

1945
01:22:33,401 --> 01:22:38,401
It doesn't make you better and,
but people take this goddamn self 

1946
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:40,980
righteous attitude when they do have 
kids and I resent it and I have kids and

1947
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:42,690
I love.
I love my kids.

1948
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,810
I would never trade being a father for 
anything.

1949
01:22:45,811 --> 01:22:49,260
It's a fantastic experience.
Have a kid when you are ready and have a

1950
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:54,261
kid.
If you feel something from it or don't 

1951
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:54,261
or don't eat it,
it doesn't matter like it.

1952
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,160
It's a great thing for me.
I enjoy,

1953
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,800
but you don't have to.
I know a lot like my friend chris ryan,

1954
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:02,640
dr chris ryan who wrote sex at dawn.
He made a conscious decision.

1955
01:23:02,641 --> 01:23:04,020
We as younger,
no kids.

1956
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,410
He wanted to travel the world.

1957
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,810
He lived in barcelona.
I mean he wrote books.

1958
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:11,160
He decided he had a life that he wanted 
to live for.

1959
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,660
This pisses me off when people don't 
want kids.

1960
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:18,720
really.
My brother don't let kids and drives me 

1961
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:18,720
nuts because he loves them.
Give something back,

1962
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:20,860
man.
You're pulling this earth to procreate.

1963
01:23:20,861 --> 01:23:22,060
Give something back.
Oh,

1964
01:23:22,061 --> 01:23:24,370
I don't know about all that.
Why you put on this earth to procreate.

1965
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,400
Okay.
for the same reason,

1966
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:31,090
homeboy before they're all dying.
Not everybody has that much to offer.

1967
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,770
So some people,
some people may like,

1968
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:38,110
how about somebody who is basically 
unhappy with their life and they have 

1969
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,750
kids or if they don't have too much 
stevie again,

1970
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:41,290
that's.
Yeah,

1971
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,570
watch how I do bro.
This is the stuff.

1972
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,600
That's what I do.
There's more of these grabbiNg a whole 

1973
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:48,600
form towns and grab another one.
Man county.

1974
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:48,700
Can I drink all this?

1975
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,120
He doesn't even drink it.
He gave up already falling asleep.

1976
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:53,410
I'll get them over there and I'm all 
like sensitive.

1977
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:54,730
I have one cup.
I'm like,

1978
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:55,570
well,
I feel shaky.

1979
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,070
I.
I know what you're saying.

1980
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,920
You don't think that there's a good 
thing to do.

1981
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,010
When I like clothes,
I like shopping.

1982
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:04,720
I like my vacations.
I don't want kids.

1983
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:05,860
Why is that?
You know what?

1984
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:07,150
Lose my number.
You're not my friend anymore.

1985
01:24:07,820 --> 01:24:10,030
How dare you,
but why is that bad?

1986
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:13,120
Why do you care what other people?
I don't know.

1987
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,160
That doesn't make any sense.
Especially if they're close to me.

1988
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,330
You know what drives me?
Nuts,

1989
01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:21,331
man.
If people hate kids and something about 

1990
01:24:21,331 --> 01:24:22,660
women hating kids.
I wrote this on twitter once that I view

1991
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:27,661
women who don't like kids the same way 
of your dogs like to eat their own shit 

1992
01:24:27,661 --> 01:24:29,850
and then the cis male feminist guy wrote
this huge blog.

1993
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,770
I should have said hate.
I said,

1994
01:24:32,771 --> 01:24:37,771
don't like,
so he connected it to the only reason 

1995
01:24:37,771 --> 01:24:39,691
why women exist in his world is to have 
children like they added a bunch of 

1996
01:24:39,691 --> 01:24:42,460
stupid shit that I don't believe at all.
To reInforce this idiotic point.

1997
01:24:42,461 --> 01:24:44,650
You're writing a blog about a tweet.
You fucking idiot.

1998
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:45,430
True.
You know,

1999
01:24:45,431 --> 01:24:46,440
that's,
that's what you're doing.

2000
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:49,630
And by the way,
he's an academic to first of all,

2001
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,580
for you singles out there,
red flags.

2002
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:53,860
If a girl likes cat,
doesn't like dogs,

2003
01:24:53,861 --> 01:24:55,540
and then like kids.
Yeah,

2004
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:59,230
I'll read,
carry on in some people's lives,

2005
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:04,231
in some people's lives,
it's a good thing if you want to check 

2006
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:04,231
the doesn't like kids and you don't like
kids.

2007
01:25:04,231 --> 01:25:05,200
She don't like kids.
She's probably pretty selfish.

2008
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,760
My man could be.
you're right.

2009
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,210
No,
no.

2010
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,410
Most likely,
most likely your she's into something or

2011
01:25:11,411 --> 01:25:12,420
she's just in tip.

2012
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:17,140
She could be and makes $8 a day.
I mean,

2013
01:25:17,141 --> 01:25:20,080
who looks well?
Everybody has to want children,

2014
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:25,230
but yeah,
it couldn't be some sort of a really 

2015
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:27,721
demanding occupation.
She handles really bad childhood or she 

2016
01:25:28,301 --> 01:25:29,850
had a really bad childhood.
Okay.

2017
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:32,440
And again,
you guys are talking about the exception

2018
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:37,740
in general in general,
she doesn't like someone who has a 

2019
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,910
really good career or demanding career 
today.

2020
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:41,470
That's not really the exception that 
much.

2021
01:25:41,471 --> 01:25:43,810
There's a lot of women who have very 
demanding careers today.

2022
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,130
Yeah.
And very fulfilling.

2023
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:48,070
You don't run into them.
I do look at brendan just made the like,

2024
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:49,420
I just farted.
You know what?

2025
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:50,140
In la.
Yeah,

2026
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:52,570
they're everywhere.
I meet a model actress.

2027
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:57,571
I mean what you just said right there 
from regular women.

2028
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:04,680
I understand what you're saying.
Let's broaden our horizons and try even 

2029
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:09,641
though with three.
I'm talking from brendan shot in marina 

2030
01:26:09,641 --> 01:26:09,641
del rey.

2031
01:26:09,641 --> 01:26:11,560
I'm not talking about finished the world
and brennan shop.

2032
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:13,970
Marina del rey.
People that don't want to have kids.

2033
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:15,170
Like,
fuck you.

2034
01:26:15,230 --> 01:26:16,550
Here's my number.
There you go.

2035
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:17,840
There you go.
There you go.

2036
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,450
She goes,
hey,

2037
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:22,620
I'm kelly.
I love cats.

2038
01:26:22,621 --> 01:26:25,370
I've had cats.
I hate kids and I hate dogs.

2039
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:25,940
I'm like,
cool.

2040
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:27,690
Over red flag.
Well that's.

2041
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:31,130
That's how that lack of not liking dogs 
thing.

2042
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:36,131
It's a weird thing because it's like,
unless you're allergic to them that I 

2043
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:36,131
understand,
but if it's like a,

2044
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:40,750
like a nurture thing,
like you don't like animals that like 

2045
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:44,321
you or need you.
I'm I like my cat because I can push it 

2046
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:45,720
away and never cries.
I can leave food that's in a weekend.

2047
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,100
That's a personality trait.
Like I love dogs.

2048
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:54,280
What?
Somebody one time explain to me what a 

2049
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,651
dog is and they were talking.
I read this article about how dogs are 

2050
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:58,670
evolved to be really friendly and that's
how they manipulate the cosmos cosmos.

2051
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,990
when I read that I went.
I was like,

2052
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,180
maybe I Don't like my dog as much as I 
used to.

2053
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:04,580
I used to really like be like my dogs,
like a human.

2054
01:27:04,581 --> 01:27:05,970
I talked to them now I'm like,
yeah,

2055
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:07,430
you're a dog here.
Manipulating me.

2056
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:14,270
Know the circumstances.
Why I lost a little of my affection.

2057
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:19,930
I love dogs.
I love them and I'll never not have 

2058
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:19,930
dogs.
My wife's allergic dogs.

2059
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:19,930
I'm like,
tough shit.

2060
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,570
Dog will have dogs,
but she takes medication shot.

2061
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:25,070
She just doesn't like hug them as long 
as she doesn't hug them.

2062
01:27:25,071 --> 01:27:26,420
It's fine.
It's not severe really.

2063
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,650
Yeah.
But if she hugs him,

2064
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:29,900
she's gets red marks on her arms.
It's very common.

2065
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:31,730
But some people,
man,

2066
01:27:31,731 --> 01:27:34,280
like I'm Gary Valentine,
a buddy of mine,

2067
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:37,250
you know gary comic,
he couldn't come over my house because I

2068
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:40,130
have cats.
I have cats and dogs.

2069
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,840
Dang dog.
I love animals.

2070
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,540
I do too,
but not cat.

2071
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:46,390
I'm allergic to them.
Never had a cap.

2072
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,740
Gary couldn't even walk in the house.
He was his voice with his,

2073
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:49,310
uh,
his,

2074
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:51,860
his pipe start shrinking up.
Couldn't breathe.

2075
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:57,870
He would make them whIstle if I,
if I came with the house,

2076
01:27:57,890 --> 01:27:59,510
can't touch my face.
My eyes swollen.

2077
01:27:59,511 --> 01:28:00,400
Shut.
Wow.

2078
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:01,850
Allergic.
I'm allergic to nothing.

2079
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:04,430
How about think about that.
What a weird response that is.

2080
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:09,610
Normal shit for other people.
Like a bag of peanuts given to some 

2081
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,430
people and it's death.
Well,

2082
01:28:10,431 --> 01:28:15,431
well,
how about I was eating a lot of Brazil 

2083
01:28:15,431 --> 01:28:16,150
nuts and then for whatever reason,
but the my mouth.

2084
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:16,950
No.
Well yeah.

2085
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,900
No,
not me.

2086
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:19,100
Not me.
Get this.

2087
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,740
The inside of my mouth would swell up to
the point where I was like,

2088
01:28:21,770 --> 01:28:23,390
why?
Why is he inside of mouth?

2089
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:24,400
Literally I was like,
whoa,

2090
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:24,760
whoa.

2091
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,530
And it got worse and worse,
and then I was like,

2092
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:31,100
what the hell is going on?
So my mother comes over and she goes,

2093
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,870
those are Brazil nuts.
I go,

2094
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:33,530
yeah.
She goes,

2095
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,390
do you know if I eat one,
I would die.

2096
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:37,640
And I went,
what do you mean?

2097
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,850
She goes,
I can't even eat.

2098
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,640
I said,
no,

2099
01:28:40,641 --> 01:28:45,641
she,
she ate half a Brazil nut that was in a 

2100
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:45,641
salad long time ago and she had to be 
rushed to the hospital.

2101
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:46,040
Why didn't this bitch tell you?
Right.

2102
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:51,190
So what does that really mean?
I'm clearly alerted to Brazil nuts and I

2103
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:57,140
was the wolfing down.
I mean wolfing down at least partially.

2104
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,150
You probably don't have it as bad as 
her,

2105
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:00,650
but.
But when you lack,

2106
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:02,130
I guess an enzyme for certain

2107
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:05,040
nuts or whatever you.
Brazil nuts are high in zinc.

2108
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:10,041
I have you.
Have you ever had your bLood tested for 

2109
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:10,041
what you're allergic to?
I want to do my genome.

2110
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:15,200
I did a whole diet where they test your 
blood type to see what your lieutenants 

2111
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:15,780
that I'm allergic to egg yolk and that's
really it.

2112
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:17,460
Yeah,
nuts.

2113
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,560
That's crazy,
bruh,

2114
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:23,580
bro.
Brazil nuts actually can increase your 

2115
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:23,580
testosterone.
That's why I was eating them.

2116
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,440
My trainer told me to take them in my 
shake.

2117
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:30,500
Really,
mass amount of them are lIke super 

2118
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,941
fucking healthy for you.
It says a salinium apparently.

2119
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,580
Also it helps lower your ldl or bad 
cholesterol,

2120
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:41,250
reduces the Incidence of blood clots in 
heart disease.

2121
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:45,060
If I eat a shitload of brazilian nuts or
they need a lot of nuts,

2122
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:49,290
brendan tested positive for Brazil.
Says here they actually caution limiting

2123
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:54,291
yourself to no more than two Brazil nuts
per day because they are so loaded and 

2124
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:56,640
concentrated with millennium that you 
don't want to overdose.

2125
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:59,370
Copper and selenium are very important 
minerals,

2126
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:04,371
but with minerals like balance is really
key because you've got to be real 

2127
01:30:04,371 --> 01:30:06,480
careful with like overdosing and certain
minerals.

2128
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:10,490
There was cross a brazilian nuts.
I'll take this into account from dose to

2129
01:30:10,491 --> 01:30:12,870
dose daily.
They were selling these mega vitamins,

2130
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:13,260
these,
uh,

2131
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,780
these kind of talking about how they 
were selling vitamin d tablets,

2132
01:30:15,781 --> 01:30:19,510
gel caps,
and it was 3000 over 3000 milligrams and

2133
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:24,710
the guy said to get,
you'd have to eat 1500 almonds to get 

2134
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:26,070
that much vitamin e.
It's too much.

2135
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:27,920
It's just too much.
You got a lot of vitamins,

2136
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,730
you gotta you gotta.
Be careful.

2137
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,510
You can't be an idiot.
Yeah,

2138
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:33,840
that's pretty basic,
but it's easy to be an idiot.

2139
01:30:33,841 --> 01:30:35,310
Yeah.
It's easy to be an idiot,

2140
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,520
you know.
That's what's really weird about this 

2141
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:40,520
supplement.
The supplement business like uh,

2142
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,460
it's,
it's very tricky.

2143
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,670
Like what effects certain people doesn't
affect other people.

2144
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:48,360
Like with alpha brain for instance,
when we first put alpha brain now we had

2145
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:53,190
slightly different ingredients because 
some people had an adverse reaction.

2146
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:54,930
They would get like a headache when they
would take.

2147
01:30:54,931 --> 01:30:56,840
It wasn't a dangerous thing,
but it was enough for like,

2148
01:30:56,870 --> 01:30:57,960
hm,
this is,

2149
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,120
we got to back this down a little bit.
And so you,

2150
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,810
you got to be careful with like certain 
reactions that some people have.

2151
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,410
You know like you with cats like you 
with peanuts,

2152
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,790
like that's the thing when it comes to 
vaccinations,

2153
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:13,791
like everybody talks about vaccinations,
like you're either in the camp of you 

2154
01:31:13,791 --> 01:31:18,050
believe that vaccinations are evil and 
they cause autism or you're in the camp 

2155
01:31:18,050 --> 01:31:22,701
that those people are idiots and they're
dangerous and then these anti vaccine 

2156
01:31:22,701 --> 01:31:26,151
people are really making all these 
diseases like measles show up in New 

2157
01:31:26,151 --> 01:31:29,600
York city again,
but the reality is that the truth lies 

2158
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,400
somewhere in the middle because yes,
vaccines are super important.

2159
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:37,400
They're the reason why we don't have a 
lot of infectious diseases that wrecked 

2160
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,870
havoc and there's science behind them 
and it's fascinating.

2161
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:44,871
The human beings have figured out how to
create these things that have fight off 

2162
01:31:44,871 --> 01:31:48,081
diseases,
but some people are going to have 

2163
01:31:48,081 --> 01:31:48,140
adverse reactions to everYthing.
Yep.

2164
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:51,780
That's the reality of medication.
That's the reality of foods.

2165
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:55,820
That's the reality to environment.
There's some people that can't small.

2166
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:58,380
You're right,
you're right on with the masses,

2167
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:03,410
but you're.
But you're dealing with 300 million 

2168
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:03,650
people for sure,
but when you're trying to get people,

2169
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,460
but what I'm saying is when you have 
those small amount of people,

2170
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:08,770
if you have 300 million people and all 
of them get vaccinated,

2171
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,180
you're going to have 100 people,
a thousand people.

2172
01:32:11,181 --> 01:32:16,181
You can have all These examples of 
things that went wrong and people look 

2173
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:16,181
at that and go,
well look,

2174
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:18,310
there's so many people where things are 
going wrong,

2175
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:23,311
but what you're not thinking about is 
the just sheer numbers of people that 

2176
01:32:23,311 --> 01:32:26,410
kept from being diseased,
sheer numbers of people that we.

2177
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,140
How we contain polio.
We contain anything.

2178
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:32,310
Smallpox probably killed $500,
million people throughout history,

2179
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:37,610
unbelievable.
And we squashed it out through 

2180
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:40,771
vaccination.
All put so many children in on iron 

2181
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:42,700
lungs and in wheelchairs,
and not only that,

2182
01:32:42,701 --> 01:32:44,350
they did it in our grandparents' 
lifetime.

2183
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,100
Know incredible,
incredible discoveries have been made by

2184
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:53,101
science,
but it doesn't mean that some people 

2185
01:32:53,101 --> 01:32:53,101
have adverse reactions.
Some people are going to eat peanuts and

2186
01:32:53,101 --> 01:32:53,980
they shouldn't.
They're going to die.

2187
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,870
It's going to happen every year,
every year,

2188
01:32:55,900 --> 01:32:58,000
more than a thousand people die from 
aspirin.

2189
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:00,220
They take aspirin.
When you take supplements,

2190
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:04,360
make sure you look into the data because
a lot of this stuff is not regulated,

2191
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:06,970
so if you're going to take massive doses
of whatever it might be,

2192
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:10,840
make sure you take a look at the data.
Take a look at the double blind studies,

2193
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:13,250
see if it bears out well.

2194
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:15,810
not only that,
it's also when you get,

2195
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:20,880
when you get a supplement,
like say if you're running a supplement 

2196
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:21,220
company and you're buying vitamin b 12,
okay,

2197
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:26,280
yeah,
you got to fucking task the vitamin b 

2198
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:26,280
12.
You get from the source,

2199
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:27,900
whatever it is,
vitamin d,

2200
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:31,030
whatever you're you're getting.
You have to test it.

2201
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:36,300
You have to test it independently 
because with alpha brain we've had to 

2202
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,721
make sure we had in the past we had 
problems with manufacturers having like 

2203
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:45,390
bad mixtures like when you,
so calcium from bone meal has a great 

2204
01:33:45,390 --> 01:33:46,880
deal of lead in it or some.
Something like that.

2205
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:51,890
Think is What is crazy amounts of lead 
in bone meal for whatever reason.

2206
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,560
I can't remember if that's the exact 
thing,

2207
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:54,880
but it was,
it was like a metal,

2208
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:56,890
it was a case,
a lawsuit,

2209
01:33:57,370 --> 01:34:02,370
and the vitamin company has brought up 
on charges because the source of where 

2210
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:03,580
they were getting their calcium was very
heavy in.

2211
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,160
Uh,
I believe it was lead metal.

2212
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:11,260
Yeah.
So you got to know where it's sourced 

2213
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:11,590
from and you've got to know what your 
body's life.

2214
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:13,720
It's so hard to tell what the fuck's 
going on your body.

2215
01:34:13,721 --> 01:34:15,330
I told you I was having that problem 
with a.

2216
01:34:15,331 --> 01:34:18,040
I had arsenic in my blood.
It turned out it was from sardines.

2217
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:22,150
Hey,
you're spending a shitload of every.

2218
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:27,320
Every science I've had,
like I've talked to about podcasts and 

2219
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:27,320
stuff,
says they always come down to one thing.

2220
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,920
None of them say meat's bad for you.
Can I take,

2221
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:30,700
take them off?
Take.

2222
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,620
I'd take four.
Yeah.

2223
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,190
I'm going to get you some of the shrimp 
tech through texts and fascinating shit.

2224
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:37,570
Shroom tech sport.
Yeah.

2225
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:38,860
It's all quarter steps.
Mushroom.

2226
01:34:38,861 --> 01:34:43,720
It's all a oxygen utilization.
I'll show you all the data behind it and

2227
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:48,721
send it to you.
It was all a developed for the chinese 

2228
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:48,721
olympic team.
Really?

2229
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:48,760
Yeah.
Fascinating stuff.

2230
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:54,060
They found it in high altitude.
Hurting populations is animals that 

2231
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:54,060
would eat these,
uh,

2232
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,500
these mushrooms would be more active.
And so the people started it and then 

2233
01:34:58,500 --> 01:34:58,500
they started

2234
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:03,280
cultivating it.
You started using from hearing you guys 

2235
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:06,011
talk.
It sounds like it should hire you as my 

2236
01:35:06,011 --> 01:35:06,011
nutritionist.
I told you about this lady.

2237
01:35:06,011 --> 01:35:07,840
I have a good nutritionist.
A no,

2238
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:08,800
joe.
No.

2239
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,880
I know this story.
I was recommended to this late.

2240
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:17,780
I'm not going to say her name or where 
she was recommended this lady.

2241
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:18,530
She goes,
yeah,

2242
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:19,730
so this is what we do.
And she goes,

2243
01:35:19,731 --> 01:35:20,750
what are you looking to do?
I go,

2244
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,220
I love,
I love to eat clean.

2245
01:35:22,221 --> 01:35:25,370
I feel goody and clean looking to lose 
weight,

2246
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:26,540
you know,
I want to stay the same way.

2247
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:28,760
Just like eat healthy.
Perfect.

2248
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:33,800
Ideal.
I deal with a lot of high level 

2249
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:33,800
athletes.
I got you.

2250
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:37,840
I'm not making this shit up.
I showed brian this bitch gave me chili 

2251
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,980
cheese fries for breakfast,
chili cheese,

2252
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:42,200
fries,
and rice was for my breakfast.

2253
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,210
I took a picture of it,
emailed her.

2254
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,280
I said,
I think,

2255
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:48,200
I think my order got messed up because 
you said you got to pick up your meals.

2256
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:48,790
Right?
Right.

2257
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:53,800
I think the order got messed up.
There's cheese and chili all over some 

2258
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:56,420
fries for my breakfast.
She goes,

2259
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,990
you have a busy day of training.
You're going to need the calories.

2260
01:36:00,170 --> 01:36:02,450
Yeah.
She lasted for a week on brian.

2261
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,220
Why don't you keep it for.
What about the meeting?

2262
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:07,000
What was that meeting like?
I can watch all the meal.

2263
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:11,180
Eat cheese fries,
chili cheese fries and crazy mail in the

2264
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:13,120
mail.
My chili cheese fries better be fresh.

2265
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:15,230
I want him in the mail.
They don't put them in the mail.

2266
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:20,030
They delivered earlier in meals.
Delivered.

2267
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,650
Unfair.
No,

2268
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,190
I use a private company,
a small company.

2269
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:26,690
So the woman who runs,
she runs it.

2270
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:29,950
She was um,
she had a job as a um,

2271
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,570
I forgot what it was,
but she,

2272
01:36:31,571 --> 01:36:33,410
she got fired or what have you.

2273
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:36,560
And she starts her own food business.
WeLl,

2274
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:38,180
yeah,
I got chili,

2275
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:38,900
cheese,
fries.

2276
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:40,820
I fired her.
And then,

2277
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,020
um,
it,

2278
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:44,030
it didn't go.
We didn't mix right from the start,

2279
01:36:44,031 --> 01:36:46,130
right when I was in a rush,
right?

2280
01:36:46,131 --> 01:36:46,480
I'm like,
yeah,

2281
01:36:46,481 --> 01:36:47,680
I'm here to pick up my meals,
blah,

2282
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:48,050
blah,
blah.

2283
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:48,620
She's like,
well,

2284
01:36:48,621 --> 01:36:49,910
can we just sit down for a while?
I'm like,

2285
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:51,590
sure.
So she's like,

2286
01:36:51,591 --> 01:36:52,730
well,
you gotta sign this contract.

2287
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:53,690
I'm going over it.
It's like,

2288
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:58,990
oh,
hi brendan schaub for the next 30 slash 

2289
01:36:58,990 --> 01:36:59,360
77 days will not eat junk food.
I'm like,

2290
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:00,140
yeah,
whatever.

2291
01:37:00,141 --> 01:37:02,540
I will not drink soda.
I don't drink soda.

2292
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:06,860
Third one down will not drink coffee.
I will skip that one.

2293
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,090
Keep going.
Well,

2294
01:37:08,091 --> 01:37:09,200
not well,
not cool.

2295
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,810
And she's looking at it,
going through the page.

2296
01:37:11,811 --> 01:37:12,630
She goes,
okay,

2297
01:37:12,631 --> 01:37:13,400
we're good.
Oh,

2298
01:37:13,401 --> 01:37:14,630
you missed one right here.
And I go,

2299
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:16,230
yeah,
you're talking about the coffee one.

2300
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:16,580
She goes,
yeah,

2301
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,720
yo,
that ain't happening.

2302
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,070
She goes,
skews mega.

2303
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,290
I mean,
we can get into this if you want,

2304
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:23,840
but there's clinical studies that show 
coffee,

2305
01:37:23,870 --> 01:37:28,870
helps out with workouts and I mean it's 
not bad for you if you do it in 

2306
01:37:28,870 --> 01:37:28,870
moderation.
She goes,

2307
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:30,230
well then I don't know.
I go,

2308
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:31,190
well,
I'll tell you right now.

2309
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,950
It's not going to work out.
I'll walk ouT right now.

2310
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,670
She goes,
all right,

2311
01:37:34,671 --> 01:37:37,040
I'll make one exception and then just 
right then I was like,

2312
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,300
god,
this is not going good.

2313
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,930
Yeah,
I don't work with her anymore.

2314
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:43,400
Long story short,
she got fired.

2315
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:44,990
Chili cheese fries should have fired 
her.

2316
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:49,991
That shit's ridiculous.
You should be eating fruit and 

2317
01:37:49,991 --> 01:37:49,991
vegetables,
not chili fries.

2318
01:37:49,991 --> 01:37:52,670
Chili cheese fries with rice.
And she said the calories.

2319
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:54,500
Oh my god,
she's so retarded.

2320
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,010
This is pre workout.
Did she ever

2321
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:59,190
worked out hard a day in her life?
Do you know what kinda throw up and shit

2322
01:37:59,191 --> 01:38:01,470
would come out of your body if you eat 
chili cheese,

2323
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:03,960
fries and that did like a strength and 
conditioning workout.

2324
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:06,870
Did box jumps and kettle bells and 
battle ropes.

2325
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,720
Chili running through your bowels.
You ready for this?

2326
01:38:09,730 --> 01:38:10,380
I,
I,

2327
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:14,010
I'm going to launch at the bell.
The only heavy weighting.

2328
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,800
Who's on a diet like this?
It's called the alpha diet.

2329
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:22,580
I don't eat breakfast.
I do bulletproof coffee and the mct oil 

2330
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:22,880
and I hit the ground running.
Well,

2331
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,680
that is about don't you juice in the 
morning?

2332
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:26,520
Vegetable juice?
Yeah,

2333
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:31,540
yeah.
Oh well that's something too and you'd 

2334
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:31,890
be amazed at how much butter and mct oil
you're dealing.

2335
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:37,130
The reason why this bulletproof blend 
works is because you have the healthy 

2336
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:39,210
fats connected to the caffeine.
It's a slow burn of the caffeine,

2337
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,430
but you can't get over the actual 
calories.

2338
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:46,430
I mean someone should take one of these 
things and find out how much like a 

2339
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:50,331
thermos of this bitch is calorically 
with that much butter and that much mct 

2340
01:38:50,331 --> 01:38:51,390
oil.
I bet it's quite a bit.

2341
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:56,410
Oh yeah.
Eating a funk on hunk of butter takes a 

2342
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:56,410
while for your body to digest those 
fats,

2343
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:58,070
but it's.
I'm it though.

2344
01:38:58,130 --> 01:39:00,630
You could burn.
It's a great way to work out,

2345
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:03,540
like to drink that stuff in the morning 
because you feel full,

2346
01:39:03,541 --> 01:39:07,050
you have energy and yet you still get a 
good workout and drinking.

2347
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,960
What about eating a sugar source before 
you work out?

2348
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:13,080
like a,
like what would it be good.

2349
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,620
Like they say nothing's better than 
fruits.

2350
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:17,280
So not pancakes or.
No,

2351
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:17,910
no,
no,

2352
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:18,330
no,
no.

2353
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:21,240
That's terrible for you.
Pick some chili cheese fries.

2354
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:24,900
If you're doing endurance sports.
Gluten is a tricky thing,

2355
01:39:24,901 --> 01:39:29,901
man,
because if you have a bad reaction to 

2356
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:29,901
gluten,
um,

2357
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:30,870
you're,
you're going to have all sorts of issues

2358
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:33,450
and even if you don't have a bad 
reaction to gluten,

2359
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:38,720
the studies are showing pretty clearly 
that it causes inflammation and it may 

2360
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,290
be fine,
but with a lot of people,

2361
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,970
you get this bloated appearance.

2362
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:45,470
Like I've seen people go from wheat to 
no wheat and then they're,

2363
01:39:45,471 --> 01:39:48,090
the face shrinks in their body,
looks different.

2364
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:53,150
It's like your body's inflamed and it's 
a lot of weird calories.

2365
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:56,010
It's calories where your body's breaking
down glue,

2366
01:39:56,270 --> 01:39:57,690
you know?
I mean taste great.

2367
01:39:57,810 --> 01:39:59,250
I mean,
I love lasagna,

2368
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:01,830
I love pasta,
I love delicious bread.

2369
01:40:02,020 --> 01:40:02,820
Don't.
It's great.

2370
01:40:02,821 --> 01:40:04,320
You go to a restaurant,
italian restaurant,

2371
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,070
they bring over that pregnant,
smell it and yes,

2372
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,480
I'll put some butter on that and me and 
brian like a nice cheese plate,

2373
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:11,520
little cheese plates,
these plates.

2374
01:40:11,521 --> 01:40:12,480
Nice.
It is.

2375
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:15,240
The problem is gluten is just not a 
smart choice.

2376
01:40:15,241 --> 01:40:17,310
If you thinking about what you're going 
to put in your body,

2377
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:22,850
why fuck around with that?
You could have lettuce and you can have 

2378
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:23,700
all sorts of delicious greens and you 
could have fresh meats.

2379
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,390
You're going to have a good.
Your body's going to get good nutrients,

2380
01:40:27,391 --> 01:40:32,391
can have What it needs when you're 
having gluten or pasta or anything like 

2381
01:40:32,391 --> 01:40:35,451
that.
You're just giving it a nice delicious 

2382
01:40:35,451 --> 01:40:35,451
taste,
and if that's where you're cool with,

2383
01:40:35,451 --> 01:40:36,420
that's cool.
You know you're just out on a date,

2384
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:41,421
one to have a delicious meal,
but if you want performance food for 

2385
01:40:41,421 --> 01:40:44,151
your body,
you really shouldn't fuck with anything 

2386
01:40:44,151 --> 01:40:44,151
that's complicated.
Exactly.

2387
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:45,890
Sweet potato,
chicken breasts,

2388
01:40:45,891 --> 01:40:48,180
sweet potatoes and yams.
Fish.

2389
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:50,560
You know,
if you can get some game,

2390
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:52,770
get some deer.
buffalo.

2391
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,020
Yeah.
You know what else

2392
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:54,910
is good?
Lamb.

2393
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:56,700
Ryan.
What'd?

2394
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:58,740
What'd you guys hunt?
Deer.

2395
01:40:58,880 --> 01:40:59,950
Deer.
Good,

2396
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:06,110
good.
So rich in nutrients and vitamins ever 

2397
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:06,170
had it.
So low in cholesterol roasted.

2398
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:11,230
I'll make a roast steak.
A 12 ounce elk stake has less 

2399
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:14,440
cholesterol than a 12 ounce chicken 
breast to shit on that sticker.

2400
01:41:14,441 --> 01:41:17,080
There's nothing better than elk.
So good for you too.

2401
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:22,081
It tastes so good.
It's like almost got a sweet taste to 

2402
01:41:22,081 --> 01:41:22,081
it.
It's a dark red meat.

2403
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,810
Oh,
elk tenderloin grill.

2404
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,050
It's so stupid.
I was eating every meal,

2405
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:30,640
every meet including mountain lion,
and he goes,

2406
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:32,560
ah,
and he goes,

2407
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:33,550
yeah.
He said,

2408
01:41:33,551 --> 01:41:35,410
if I had the one meeting every day,
it'd be out.

2409
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:40,560
Yeah.
A lot of people think that giant animal 

2410
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:40,560
never had elk.
You should be hunter.

2411
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:41,910
You'd love it.
Hate.

2412
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:46,970
I hate.
I sent a picture of the deer and we 

2413
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:46,970
could use bone marrow.

2414
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:46,970
I'd be telling,
man,

2415
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:47,860
we'd be down for that.
Oh yeah,

2416
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,360
let's do it.
I said the three of us,

2417
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:52,000
deer hunting to hone ranch would be down
for that.

2418
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:53,920
I bet you would be down for naked and 
afraid.

2419
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:56,110
I'm doing this thing.
Doing his thing.

2420
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:56,560
No,
no.

2421
01:41:56,561 --> 01:42:01,561
We're gonna wear.
I'm gonna wear extra clothes just 

2422
01:42:01,561 --> 01:42:03,601
because I love it.
I think I would wreck shop on that show.

2423
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,330
I think you do find until you got your 
dick bit by a spider and then you cry.

2424
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:11,560
There you go.
Because I'm telling you to own ranch,

2425
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:14,350
hour and a half north of here.
We stay for a weekend.

2426
01:42:14,351 --> 01:42:19,351
We film it.
We go pig hunting with bows and arrows 

2427
01:42:19,351 --> 01:42:19,351
to it.
I'm so down for two days though,

2428
01:42:19,351 --> 01:42:19,900
right?
Two days.

2429
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:22,780
Saturday and sunday,
and then we say,

2430
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,630
hey,
and then we spot on sunday.

2431
01:42:25,650 --> 01:42:28,620
I'll fill his spot,
spot each other lifting spot,

2432
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,170
spa,
spa,

2433
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:31,630
hot tub,
facials.

2434
01:42:31,810 --> 01:42:32,890
I got confused.
I was like,

2435
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:35,050
he's a prima donna.
They'll be like,

2436
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:40,080
what if he.
If he got the toughest one of the 

2437
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,080
toughest guys in the planet,
he misses a meal.

2438
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,980
If he's a half hour late to him,
you know,

2439
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:43,270
he's like this,
I'm lightheaded man.

2440
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:48,540
I'm starving.
But you gotta think of what he's doing 

2441
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:48,540
with his body all day.
You can't even imagine.

2442
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,230
I'm chilly.
I'm cold.

2443
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:50,770
You guys.

2444
01:42:53,290 --> 01:42:56,140
Imagine how fucking much he works out.
I know you don't.

2445
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,720
You don't take that into consideration.
No,

2446
01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:02,730
I don't.
Brian who I work out all the time once a

2447
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:07,740
week,
he might get in a workout once a week 

2448
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:08,830
and he probably instagrams that to just 
work out moderately.

2449
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:11,380
You might work out once a week.
You might go a month.

2450
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:15,910
He's the guy on was the longest day.
How many days have you gone?

2451
01:43:15,911 --> 01:43:17,950
The longest without anyone at work.
Every single day.

2452
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:20,890
The fuck away from that question.
I'll come to your house and find you not

2453
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:24,850
working out.
How about this box?

2454
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,220
Twice a week,
but I work out too.

2455
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:29,800
I don't work out.
I don't ever work out everyday.

2456
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:31,690
Nobody works out every day.
You need days off.

2457
01:43:31,790 --> 01:43:34,790
I take sunday off.
Oh,

2458
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:35,500
well,
almost now.

2459
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,840
It's almost used to be.
I workout everyday.

2460
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:40,180
I'll tell you what though.
Brian's footwork is impressive.

2461
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:44,440
It's impressive.
When I saw pres.

2462
01:43:44,590 --> 01:43:48,250
Thank you buddy is a dancer.
I'm going to teach them different moves.

2463
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,350
Move his feet around it.
He's got an aldi.

2464
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:52,820
Tony's a good teacher,
man.

2465
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,730
Trying to try to move around that guy.
My god the best.

2466
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:57,140
Oh,
by the way,

2467
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:59,330
I am when I'm.
By the way,

2468
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:01,460
and by the way again,
I am definitely not.

2469
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:06,470
As you get more tired boxing,
just try to just try to move around and 

2470
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:08,150
you're exhausted.
Focus right now.

2471
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:09,860
Can we?
Can you pull in your cock?

2472
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:14,480
Kelsey's tight ass peter.
Pan green jeans on peace and it's peace.

2473
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:17,300
It's just bulging out.
What are you doing?

2474
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:20,020
I'm an american.
Rather than your crocodile?

2475
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,520
No,
but whenever I'm around brendan,

2476
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,150
a little extra blood flows in.
Well,

2477
01:44:23,151 --> 01:44:28,151
you know what it is.
It's that same thing that causes men 

2478
01:44:28,151 --> 01:44:29,090
chimps to have bigger balls.
It's like you're around a an alpha male,

2479
01:44:29,091 --> 01:44:30,290
and he's like,
well,

2480
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:32,060
I'm trying to compete and your dick is 
like,

2481
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:33,350
we better get bigger for sure.

2482
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:35,240
Get your dick out of my face.
Yeah.

2483
01:44:35,241 --> 01:44:37,930
That's not the way to compete for sure.
It very.

2484
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,520
Obviously you're mixing it up.
You get confused.

2485
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:42,350
They'll get these chimps.
Paul's looking at that.

2486
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,410
Yeah.
That's it.

2487
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:46,130
The muscles on that chance.
Jesus christ.

2488
01:44:46,250 --> 01:44:47,310
Good luck with that.
No,

2489
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:52,410
it's cancer or brutality,
but totally different tendonous 

2490
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:52,410
structure.
Everything's bigger and thicker.

2491
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:54,210
Everything's ridiculous.
God,

2492
01:44:54,290 --> 01:44:59,290
that thing weighs 150 pounds and they 
can throw itself through the air with 

2493
01:44:59,290 --> 01:45:02,891
its arms.
Let's imagine that they grab a branch 

2494
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:03,890
and just throw themselves through the 
air.

2495
01:45:03,891 --> 01:45:08,230
It's that other one like it's velcro and
just hang and fucking.

2496
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:11,030
They could be a thousand feet off the 
ground hanging from a branch.

2497
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,830
Do you,
joe?

2498
01:45:12,831 --> 01:45:15,530
Do you think you could tear it up on 
naked and afraid?

2499
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:17,750
Me and brian,
you wouldn't do well.

2500
01:45:17,860 --> 01:45:19,310
No one days.
Nope.

2501
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:24,400
First of all,
the stupidity of it all would insult me 

2502
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:28,031
as a human being so dumb that I was 
willing to be on a show that was 

2503
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:28,820
exploiting me to the point of making me 
naked.

2504
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:30,980
Go through the fucking jungle.
I'd be like,

2505
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,660
after one day I'd be like,
oh my god,

2506
01:45:32,661 --> 01:45:34,300
I'm an asshole.
I am such an that.

2507
01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:36,230
This is who I am.
I'm not spiderman.

2508
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:40,860
I'm not fucking herschel walker talker 
too.

2509
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:44,180
He'd be like,
this pillow was my with dirt on my balls

2510
01:45:44,181 --> 01:45:45,530
and I'm like,
this is so stupid.

2511
01:45:45,531 --> 01:45:48,530
I'm sleeping on dirt.
There's spiders everywhere.

2512
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:51,140
I just like the challenge.
I'm not outdoors.

2513
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:56,141
Guy had hunting gear like joe and I did 
with gear with tense.

2514
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,400
That's a bitch.
That sounds super boring.

2515
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,350
It wasn't boring at all.
It was very exciting.

2516
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:06,170
Brian in Montana,
I was scary.

2517
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:08,750
That was fun.
It was really fun.

2518
01:46:08,780 --> 01:46:13,780
We went rafting 40 miles down the 
Missouri river place where there's 

2519
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:15,920
nobody.
I mean we saw five people in five days.

2520
01:46:16,140 --> 01:46:18,980
I'm down to kill animals with a bow gun 
does nothing for me.

2521
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:24,040
Just super boring guns is a great way to
do it because you definitely kill them 

2522
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,050
and you also can get them at a large 
distance so you can get many more shots.

2523
01:46:27,290 --> 01:46:29,740
Like getting up on some animals is super
problematic.

2524
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:32,800
Problematic with a bone arrow,
like what we did kind of hunting.

2525
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:33,860
We did,
yeah.

2526
01:46:33,861 --> 01:46:36,320
They started a lot too.
They also,

2527
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,640
you know,
they.

2528
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:40,970
They had been doing.
they did okay and did pretty well.

2529
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:45,971
There's a lot more buffalo back then 
they didn't have the long range rifle 

2530
01:46:45,971 --> 01:46:46,610
capabilities of wait,
so they got in the water.

2531
01:46:46,611 --> 01:46:47,470
A lot of times they went to,
they,

2532
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:49,450
they crossed the river and then they we 
to do that.

2533
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:49,980
That could

2534
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,950
be the three of us.
We wait until they get in the water.

2535
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:54,730
We start just bam,
bam,

2536
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:58,650
bam.
Whenever I have a 90 pound draw,

2537
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:03,050
it shoots a 475 green arrow,
which is pretty heavy.

2538
01:47:03,070 --> 01:47:07,260
Three hundred and two feet per second.
It blows through everything.

2539
01:47:07,590 --> 01:47:10,580
It'll blow through a buffalo and elk 
there.

2540
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,640
Everything.
Boom,

2541
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:13,230
right through bone.
Everything.

2542
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:14,130
Boom.
It's gone right?

2543
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:16,110
It goes through trees.
I shoot it.

2544
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:21,111
If I,
if I missed the target and it hit like 

2545
01:47:21,111 --> 01:47:21,111
it hit the,
um,

2546
01:47:21,111 --> 01:47:23,100
I had the target set up on this a fence 
post.

2547
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,280
It blew right through the fence post,
like a big hey by four of would blew 

2548
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:29,640
right through and out the other side,
a two by four.

2549
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:32,550
Think about what it would do to a body.
Wow.

2550
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:34,500
Yeah.
And so one of those,

2551
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:40,100
you might as well have a gun,
but you're going to have to be close 

2552
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:41,160
enough to hit it and shooting anything 
20 yards away,

2553
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:41,850
it's tough.

2554
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:45,300
Forty yards away is really tough.
Like the difference between when I shoot

2555
01:47:45,301 --> 01:47:47,940
a target that's 20 yards away and 40 
yards away,

2556
01:47:48,090 --> 01:47:51,290
like the amount of movement that you 
could do before you release the arrow,

2557
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:56,300
a 20,
you got a little bit of wiggle room and 

2558
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:58,191
then you can release it,
but you get to 40 and it's so minute 

2559
01:47:58,191 --> 01:48:01,761
because you're looking at something 
that's not magnified your site and 

2560
01:48:01,761 --> 01:48:05,331
you're looking at target that's so small
because it's so far away and you just 

2561
01:48:05,331 --> 01:48:06,690
keeping that motherfucker right there 
and then letting it go.

2562
01:48:06,810 --> 01:48:09,830
Don't you find that more exciting than 
having this done?

2563
01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:12,640
That basically does it all itself.
It's like a video games.

2564
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:17,660
Definitely more exciting.
Animal comes walking through your 

2565
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,541
fricking.
Here's the problem with that logic 

2566
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:20,541
though.
Here's a problem with that logic.

2567
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:20,541
That poor animal will definitely get 
killed.

2568
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:21,150
If you have a rifle with a scope.

2569
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,590
If you have a rifle,
a scope,

2570
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:24,450
you're looking at that animal from 200 
yards away.

2571
01:48:24,451 --> 01:48:25,830
That's a dead animal.
Boom.

2572
01:48:25,831 --> 01:48:27,270
You're blowing a hole through that thing
clean.

2573
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:32,420
If that deer is sitting there,
it's all in you not fucking up or your 

2574
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:33,440
your gear being off.
You could I.

2575
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:35,580
I fucked up in Wisconsin.
I dropped my rifle.

2576
01:48:35,581 --> 01:48:39,600
I fell on a hill and my rifle scope.
Then when they installed the scope,

2577
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:45,170
changed the scope.
When we got to Wisconsin and the guY 

2578
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:45,170
when he put the scope on,
didn't have it tight and when we fail,

2579
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:50,130
it was like you could lose it where you 
can move it with your fingers and it 

2580
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:50,430
caused an animal.
Get wounded you.

2581
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:55,450
You don't want that and you have a way 
more of a chance of that with a bow and 

2582
01:48:55,450 --> 01:48:59,730
arrow way hard to shoot an animal with a
rifle.

2583
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:03,370
Shooting an animal with a bow and arrow 
is really good.

2584
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,020
All this technology now that's hard.
When I saw the video of you,

2585
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,260
the three of you just chilling like this
one sleeping bag,

2586
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:15,261
telling jokes and then this little like 
reindeer came prancing around and 

2587
01:49:15,261 --> 01:49:15,870
caribou.
They live in Alaska.

2588
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:18,690
You had like a bazooka and it came a 
bazooka.

2589
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:19,300
No,
it wasn't a.

2590
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:24,360
It was a canon light.
We had a helicopter gunshIp greater than

2591
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:25,740
me while you eat me,
dude,

2592
01:49:25,741 --> 01:49:30,741
what are you talking about?
You're just getting something that's 

2593
01:49:30,741 --> 01:49:32,810
tortured all its life and then shoved 
into a fucking vice and they put a 

2594
01:49:32,810 --> 01:49:33,150
piston.
I'm not against it.

2595
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,060
I'm just saying it doesn't seem very 
exciting.

2596
01:49:36,090 --> 01:49:41,090
It's very exciting when that animal 
comes out of the woods and it's looking 

2597
01:49:41,090 --> 01:49:41,300
around.
When you get an animal in your sites,

2598
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,530
first of all,
you've been tracking it for three days,

2599
01:49:43,531 --> 01:49:46,050
four days and you haven't seen and it's 
a wild animal.

2600
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,000
I'm just saying if you were it with,
with,

2601
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,110
with bows and arrows,
technology,

2602
01:49:50,111 --> 01:49:51,100
it'd be a lot cooler.
Well,

2603
01:49:51,101 --> 01:49:53,080
here's the thing.
In Montana where we were,

2604
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:54,610
if you were bow hunting,
you're fucked.

2605
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:56,200
You're not going to get it close enough.
Shot.

2606
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:59,770
The closest shot I got was 200 yards.
Those the only shot that I got,

2607
01:49:59,771 --> 01:50:02,530
I got one deer shot it at 200 yards.
There's a long way.

2608
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,800
The you can't even see that far with a 
bow and arrow site.

2609
01:50:05,801 --> 01:50:10,801
I mean the idea that you're going to 
hold that dear and it's gonna look so 

2610
01:50:10,801 --> 01:50:14,890
small when you're looking at it with not
even harder.

2611
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:15,490
It's not.
I mean,

2612
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:17,920
I don't think anybody's ever done it.
I mean maybe a few people have done it,

2613
01:50:17,921 --> 01:50:22,921
but you have to be like expert archers 
to shoot a deer at 210 to 20 yards.

2614
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:25,510
But with a rifle that's,
that's common.

2615
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:26,540
Super common.
Yeah.

2616
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,970
You know,
you line it up,

2617
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:30,520
it's a magnifying rifle,
you see the deer really clearly.

2618
01:50:30,521 --> 01:50:32,650
You locked the cross on his heart and 
boom,

2619
01:50:32,651 --> 01:50:37,651
it's over.
I think hundred would be a lot more 

2620
01:50:37,651 --> 01:50:38,560
cooler if if you were hunting like 
something that could sneak up on you and

2621
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:40,920
kill you,
it'd be a lot cooler.

2622
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:42,660
The problem like that,
like dear.

2623
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,830
Oh no,
I missed it goes prance and away.

2624
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:46,030
You know what I'm saying?
Like who cares?

2625
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:48,400
So it would be cooler if Your life was 
in danger.

2626
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:51,190
That deere hat,
like salim was like waterways,

2627
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:53,770
water buffalo when you,
when you should have water buffalo.

2628
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:57,490
A lot of timeS they disappear into the 
tall grass and you must go into that.

2629
01:50:57,491 --> 01:50:59,350
Tallgrass and,
and finish them off.

2630
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:01,900
Now the video of cameron hanes shooting 
a water bugs.

2631
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:05,530
He's waiting for you.
My friend cameron hanes,

2632
01:51:05,531 --> 01:51:10,531
who uh,
is the guy who got me hooked up with 

2633
01:51:10,531 --> 01:51:13,231
hoyt and he's the guy who got me the 90 
pound bow is the same boat that he 

2634
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:13,231
shoots.

2635
01:51:13,231 --> 01:51:14,950
So I shot it at my house and it's so 
accurate.

2636
01:51:14,951 --> 01:51:16,030
I like,
I gotta get one of these things.

2637
01:51:16,031 --> 01:51:17,710
It's incredibLe.
It's so accurate.

2638
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,100
It makes me more confident to shoot 
because I know that if it hits something

2639
01:51:21,101 --> 01:51:22,570
it's because it's got sites that are 
really,

2640
01:51:22,571 --> 01:51:23,180
really.
Yes,

2641
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:24,520
and it's just.
So look at this.

2642
01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:29,670
He,
he snuck up on this 2000 pound water 

2643
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:31,180
buffalo in Australia.
They are dangerous.

2644
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:36,210
Fuck yeah they are.
We'll try running first of all runs 

2645
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:36,210
faster than you and it weighs 2000 
pounds.

2646
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:37,660
That's crazy.
So it only sees movement.

2647
01:51:37,661 --> 01:51:42,661
So You see how he's not moving.
The reason why he's not moving is 

2648
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:42,661
because it's stopped because it's sense 
movement.

2649
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:45,490
So then when it goes back to eating,
he starts creeping in.

2650
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:48,880
This whole process is taking him along 
to this guy.

2651
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:52,660
This guy I'm going hunting with shape 
two.

2652
01:51:52,690 --> 01:51:53,680
he's in very good shape.

2653
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,680
He does 20 eIght chin ups.
That's one of the reasons why he does 

2654
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:01,381
it.
So you could pull back this monster bow 

2655
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:01,381
because that beau is most human beings.
I mean you can pull it back.

2656
01:52:01,381 --> 01:52:03,560
Brian can't.
I'm so I'll do 28.

2657
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:06,820
So eight pounds.
So how did he get this?

2658
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:09,340
So this is a friend of his.
Behind him is filming this.

2659
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:14,550
See,
obviously there's a guy who was holding 

2660
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:14,550
the camera,
so he's is a long,

2661
01:52:14,550 --> 01:52:15,520
slow process.
You don't have to speed it up,

2662
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:16,130
leave it alone.
Jamie,

2663
01:52:16,450 --> 01:52:21,450
this was a long,
slow process where he has to wait for 

2664
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,530
this animal to give him a broadside shot
and when the animal's facing him,

2665
01:52:23,531 --> 01:52:26,140
he can't move at all.
This guy doesn't hunt with rifles.

2666
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:31,290
All you hunt with bows and arrows.
I liked this 60 pound ball and it was 

2667
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:36,691
really hard.
You're such a bitch going to shoot this 

2668
01:52:36,691 --> 01:52:36,691
thing at the day and it takes a long 
time bro,

2669
01:52:36,691 --> 01:52:39,190
because if you fuck up the thing knows 
you're there and it's running at you.

2670
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:43,690
Essentially it can't jump behind.
The chair goes,

2671
01:52:43,810 --> 01:52:48,810
here it goes,
so now the thing is going to give him a 

2672
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:48,810
broadside shot.
It's close enough.

2673
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:50,180
He's down to about 30 yards with a shot.
With an animal like this,

2674
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:53,450
you want to ensure that you shoot that 
thing through the fucking heart standing

2675
01:52:55,030 --> 01:53:00,030
faced the wrong way.
It has to go sideways totally because 

2676
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:00,680
right now it's quartering away,
so you're only going to hit the shoulder

2677
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:03,800
and it might not hit a vital organ.
So then you've got an angry buffalo with

2678
01:53:03,801 --> 01:53:08,801
a stick in his arm and then it's running
at you and it weighs 2000 pounds and it 

2679
01:53:08,801 --> 01:53:09,650
runs 40 miles an hour.
Good luck.

2680
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:11,420
I'm for sure.
Hi mohan.

2681
01:53:11,421 --> 01:53:12,470
Those trees.
But look,

2682
01:53:12,471 --> 01:53:14,900
this thing is waiting and so he doesn't 
move man,

2683
01:53:14,901 --> 01:53:16,640
because it's looking at it.
Look at this dude.

2684
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:21,820
So this is a long fucking stock man.
This is like a 20 minute stock or he's 

2685
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:26,120
standing there with his 90 pound fucking
bones man and he's not moving left.

2686
01:53:26,260 --> 01:53:29,690
So noW it goes back to eating.
It's decided that he's not.

2687
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:32,660
He's nothing to be ashamed or to be 
concerned with.

2688
01:53:32,690 --> 01:53:34,190
Ashamed of.
And I saved up.

2689
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:36,770
So now look,
now he sees it and he pulls it back.

2690
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:44,720
Good.

2691
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:55,270
I think runs off.
It's got to fucking grow through.

2692
01:53:55,271 --> 01:54:00,271
It goes through.
It's the side of its arm and right into 

2693
01:54:00,271 --> 01:54:00,271
its heart.
That's Why there's so much blood pouring

2694
01:54:00,271 --> 01:54:01,690
out of it.
That's why he hit it there.

2695
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:03,360
Yeah.
Well those animals,

2696
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:08,510
you have to.
You have to know the anatomy of each 

2697
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:09,420
individual animal because animals have 
their vitals in different areas.

2698
01:54:09,421 --> 01:54:10,470
So it's got.
It's got an arrow.

2699
01:54:10,471 --> 01:54:12,140
It's heart right now.
Yeah.

2700
01:54:12,270 --> 01:54:17,270
So it's going to sit there for a couple 
seconds then realize it's done that 

2701
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,520
shit.
Unlike that.

2702
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:23,240
There it is.
It's going to figure it out any second 

2703
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,391
now it just drops.
I mean when you're dealing with an 

2704
01:54:26,391 --> 01:54:31,161
animal that's that big.
Any other animal like a north american 

2705
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:31,920
animal would be dead.
A bear would be dead.

2706
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:33,720
A deer would be dead.
Anything that's.

2707
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,170
But this is just an enormous gigantic 
animal.

2708
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,450
Kidding me right now.
Look at this.

2709
01:54:40,050 --> 01:54:41,730
Yeah,
and it sort of takes awhile.

2710
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:44,910
It's just sort of bleed out and it 
wanders off and collapses.

2711
01:54:46,170 --> 01:54:51,170
He said he ate it and wayne,
he put one piece in his mouth and he 

2712
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:53,010
chewed it for half an hour before he 
could swallow it.

2713
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:54,570
That's some,
that's some dense muscle.

2714
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:55,890
Not only that,
when they were there,

2715
01:54:55,891 --> 01:55:00,891
they didn't bring any food.
they brought just enough snacks to get 

2716
01:55:00,891 --> 01:55:01,170
them through like a day and they didn't 
bring any water,

2717
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:06,230
so they had a boil.
All This water and the water all had 

2718
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:07,620
buffalo piss in it.
So every drank,

2719
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:10,020
every sip of water they drank was 
buffalo pissed.

2720
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:11,940
There's the thing fell.
It's done.

2721
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,610
wait,
now this was in um,

2722
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:15,240
in Australia.
Yeah.

2723
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:20,330
Australia.
I didn't know water buffaloes were in 

2724
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,330
Australia.
Well,

2725
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,330
they're not native.
Oh,

2726
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:20,330
okay.
This is what happened.

2727
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:24,870
One of the reasons why they encourage 
people to go over there and shoot them 

2728
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:24,870
there.
A non native invasive species,

2729
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:29,781
theY brought him over there,
but they don't have any natural 

2730
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:29,781
predators.
There's some things that can eat them,

2731
01:55:29,781 --> 01:55:34,210
like when they're babies,
like a crocodile I the size of that 

2732
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:34,210
thing,
man.

2733
01:55:34,210 --> 01:55:35,470
Jesus fucking christ.
Um,

2734
01:55:35,770 --> 01:55:37,950
some things can eat them when theY're 
babies.

2735
01:55:37,951 --> 01:55:39,260
Yeah.
Crocodiles mosTly.

2736
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,830
he's jacked.
He's in shape.

2737
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,880
yeah.
He's in very good shape.

2738
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,040
But like I said,
he all this shit

2739
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:45,270
just stick.
Trained for hunting.

2740
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:46,110
Yep.
This guy,

2741
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:47,780
um,
he runs ultra marathons,

2742
01:55:47,870 --> 01:55:49,630
so living hunt down.
He's a,

2743
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:54,860
he's got a television show and he's 
sponsored by a bunch of different 

2744
01:55:54,860 --> 01:55:55,480
companies like under armor.
He's a famous bonner,

2745
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:59,700
but this guy like he,
he does ultra marathons.

2746
01:55:59,701 --> 01:56:02,430
He ran a 100 mile marathon beast.
He's an animal.

2747
01:56:02,431 --> 01:56:07,431
He's just,
that's what he does and he just does it 

2748
01:56:07,431 --> 01:56:07,431
all.
Bow and arrow style.

2749
01:56:07,431 --> 01:56:08,300
That's my.
That's the shop.

2750
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:13,560
After you retire,
you're going to need an outlet for all 

2751
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:13,560
this savage aggression you got inside 
your body.

2752
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:13,920
So I'll tell you what,
I'm not doing what?

2753
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:16,020
Waiting six hours and shooting a water 
buffalo.

2754
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:20,700
Say you're not man,
not iron man.

2755
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:27,000
You like to hang out with you guys.
I'll drink beers and stuff.

2756
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:30,540
You'll do a lot of jujitsu.
I feel like when you retire.

2757
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:32,070
Retire for fighting.
Yeah.

2758
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:37,360
Do you have any?
I'm going to do the world's actually in 

2759
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:37,360
may.
Are you really an ag?

2760
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:37,860
Not geeky.
Whoa.

2761
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,010
Wow.
You training with the gate?

2762
01:56:40,011 --> 01:56:45,011
Do you feel like that?
Do you feel like it helps you in any 

2763
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:45,011
way?
Would I do?

2764
01:56:45,011 --> 01:56:48,351
because if I have a 250 pound black 
built on top of me and I can escape his 

2765
01:56:49,021 --> 01:56:53,580
site controller or I can control them 
when you take off the tee and these guys

2766
01:56:53,581 --> 01:56:54,690
are trying to punch me.
Man,

2767
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,090
it's,
it's easy for me really.

2768
01:56:57,091 --> 01:56:58,350
That's interesting.
So,

2769
01:56:58,351 --> 01:56:59,240
um,
it's uh,

2770
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:03,210
easier to defend because when you're 
defending with the ge you're more,

2771
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,870
you hAve to be more technical with the 
gif.

2772
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:07,200
So much to worry about.

2773
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,230
I have to worry about color chokes.
The guy can grab me and control me 

2774
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:12,780
through my age,
you know what I'm saying?

2775
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:14,810
So you feel like it's cross training?
Yes.

2776
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:19,820
It takes away my explosiveness and my 
athleticism and it forces me to use 

2777
01:57:19,820 --> 01:57:21,990
technique.
I found that with defense for sure.

2778
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:26,991
I get caught in a lot of arm bars with 
the key that I would have never got 

2779
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:29,721
crushed.
But also my in my defense goes through 

2780
01:57:29,721 --> 01:57:29,721
the roof.
Really?

2781
01:57:29,721 --> 01:57:33,860
Yeah.
So you play a different game when you 

2782
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:35,631
start doing that,
you just become much more technical and 

2783
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:35,631
much more aware of where the positions 
are.

2784
01:57:35,631 --> 01:57:36,240
Yeah.
How flexible are you,

2785
01:57:36,241 --> 01:57:37,620
man?
Uh,

2786
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:40,080
in cerTain areas like my hamstrings are 
really tight,

2787
01:57:40,420 --> 01:57:42,220
but pretty flexible.
Yeah.

2788
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,830
Do you have a.
Well,

2789
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:45,660
I shouldn't ask you this because someone
fight.

2790
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:47,790
You might try to exploit it.
what do you work your guard?

2791
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:49,800
Yeah,
some guys are like,

2792
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,450
fuck it,
I ain't going to be on my back.

2793
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,500
That's stupid.
No,

2794
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,000
listen,
when,

2795
01:57:54,010 --> 01:57:56,910
when I get taken down a little bit and 
taken down twice in the octagon.

2796
01:57:56,911 --> 01:57:59,070
But um,
I do not care.

2797
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:04,220
Like if hunt was the whole game plan,
if he trained all this wrestling still 

2798
01:58:04,220 --> 01:58:08,841
have a tough time taking me down.
But if you trained all this wrestling 

2799
01:58:08,841 --> 01:58:08,841
and decided to put me on my back,
cool,

2800
01:58:08,841 --> 01:58:10,380
let's do it.
I'm all game for that.

2801
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:12,570
I don't panic down.
I'm very comfortable down there.

2802
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,350
I spent because you gotta remember my 
daycare was shane carlin on top of me.

2803
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:18,090
I wasn't,
I wasn't getting a lot of take downs.

2804
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:23,091
I was on my back all the time.
That's a crazy way to start your 

2805
01:58:23,091 --> 01:58:23,340
training in mma.
It was horrible.

2806
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:28,910
Horrible mess.
So credit is it like everyday just beat 

2807
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,100
me up.
Trevor whitman seems like a crazy dude,

2808
01:58:29,101 --> 01:58:30,120
man.
He's A good dude.

2809
01:58:30,130 --> 01:58:31,860
I mean like a very good dude.
Good guy.

2810
01:58:31,861 --> 01:58:36,861
I haven't been there in years.
A maniac like he had shane car when I'm 

2811
01:58:36,861 --> 01:58:41,380
like why they wanted to have shankar 
wind sport spar with gsp and gsp was 

2812
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:41,380
like,
what?

2813
01:58:41,380 --> 01:58:42,100
Yeah,
why

2814
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,900
would I,
why?

2815
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,610
Why would I spar him?
Like what are you talking about?

2816
01:58:45,611 --> 01:58:49,180
You and I think like trevor's a genius 
when comes straight and stuff like that.

2817
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:54,181
But I think back on it and there's this 
thing where I felt like I had to prove 

2818
01:58:54,181 --> 01:58:58,690
day everyone I could hang with shane 
carlin and no matter when we were 

2819
01:58:58,690 --> 01:59:01,950
sparring,
that's how my footwork got so good 

2820
01:59:01,950 --> 01:59:03,631
because I'm used to this giant water 
buffalo mad water buffalo chasing me 

2821
01:59:03,631 --> 01:59:08,281
around the octagon.
So I was trying to get out of the way 

2822
01:59:08,281 --> 01:59:08,680
because he landed right hand.
It was a short and he was not good man.

2823
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,320
Yeah,
that's trouble.

2824
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:10,630
He hits so hard.
He's got.

2825
01:59:10,670 --> 01:59:13,360
So I got used to that right.
And I'm moving nonstop.

2826
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:16,780
And then when the bell go dinging with 
30 seconds left,

2827
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:22,110
literally no matter what we're doing,
me and shane would stop walk to the 

2828
01:59:22,110 --> 01:59:24,880
middle of the cage and just rock 'em 
sock 'em robots.

2829
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:30,430
I did that for three years.
And then finally a part of me was like a

2830
01:59:30,580 --> 01:59:35,580
how about no.
And I shot a double bag on them and 

2831
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:35,580
we've never done that again.
Yeah.

2832
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,270
But I think back on my training,
I'm like,

2833
01:59:37,271 --> 01:59:38,200
god,
that was stupid.

2834
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,820
Even taking them down.
I mean,

2835
01:59:39,821 --> 01:59:41,980
he's so strong.
He's a big guY.

2836
01:59:41,981 --> 01:59:44,560
This guy ever is a big fucking guy,
man.

2837
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:49,620
Strong.
A lot stronger than you and your strong 

2838
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:49,620
shane is 100 percent stronger than me.
NoT even close.

2839
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:52,930
he's ridiculously strong.
bone structure is just.

2840
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:54,960
He's bigger than me.
He's bigger than lesnar.

2841
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:56,920
Legs are thick,
thick ass.

2842
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:59,050
Huge shoulders.
His hands,

2843
01:59:59,051 --> 02:00:00,950
man,
before they did the,

2844
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:03,370
they redid the ufc glove to fit over his
hands.

2845
02:00:03,371 --> 02:00:04,450
Shane's.
Shane's.

2846
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:07,480
The reason why they changed the glove.
Shane had a five xl gloves.

2847
02:00:07,490 --> 02:00:10,990
You have to cut the glove just to get 
over to his hands are so ridiculous when

2848
02:00:10,991 --> 02:00:11,470
you shake them.

2849
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:14,170
It's like holding onto a hand.
So what was frustrating to me is,

2850
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:16,040
you know,
I've always been in love with jujitsu.

2851
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:18,700
I would spend,
shane would get injured or you'd have to

2852
02:00:18,701 --> 02:00:23,701
work at a regular job and I was just 
trained full time and I would think I 

2853
02:00:23,701 --> 02:00:26,641
was being so good at jujitsu and shane 
would come in off a nine to five shift 

2854
02:00:26,641 --> 02:00:28,050
walk in.
But jujitsu hunt,

2855
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:28,870
let's do it.
I'm like,

2856
02:00:28,871 --> 02:00:31,870
I'm going roll this big dude.
you just shut.

2857
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,900
Shut it all down.
When I was training at a mall,

2858
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:35,230
he came by and uh,
and,

2859
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:37,840
and trained one day and uh,
I didn't get to roll with them,

2860
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:43,020
but uh,
I watched people roll with them and it 

2861
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:45,481
was,
it was like a child playing with his 

2862
02:00:45,481 --> 02:00:47,530
daddy.
Bear with me just like rolling over.

2863
02:00:47,531 --> 02:00:51,220
And I go with big guys,
all the big guys all the time,

2864
02:00:51,221 --> 02:00:53,830
but none like shane when he doesn't even
look real.

2865
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:55,830
when he walked in the door,
if I didn't know him,

2866
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:56,900
I was like,
what's up shane?

2867
02:00:57,160 --> 02:01:02,160
But if I didn't know him,
I would say to look at this 

2868
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:05,290
motherfucker.
He's got legs grown out of his 

2869
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:05,290
shoulders.
This is how it happened.

2870
02:01:05,290 --> 02:01:05,320
I was like,
oh,

2871
02:01:05,321 --> 02:01:07,450
I want to be a fighter.
I knew neymar cart.

2872
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,610
I looked him up online,
found out.

2873
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:11,530
Whereas cademy was in aurora,
my hometown.

2874
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:13,660
I show up there.
Nate's a great guy,

2875
02:01:13,661 --> 02:01:14,050
right?
He's like,

2876
02:01:14,051 --> 02:01:15,270
yeah man,
well we Can do.

2877
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:16,960
We can do this.
We'll figure it out.

2878
02:01:17,140 --> 02:01:18,790
Come tomorrow.
There's another big guy.

2879
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:20,620
He just,
he only has like one fight.

2880
02:01:20,621 --> 02:01:23,140
He just started fighting and he played 
football too.

2881
02:01:23,260 --> 02:01:24,040
Like,
oh cool.

2882
02:01:24,250 --> 02:01:25,780
I show up.
It's sparring,

2883
02:01:25,781 --> 02:01:30,781
right?
I show up and in blockchain current at 

2884
02:01:30,781 --> 02:01:33,280
the time is 315 lbs.
Fighting the wec just jacked,

2885
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:38,340
looked like a silver back gorilla that 
just found the weight room and does 

2886
02:01:38,340 --> 02:01:41,371
nothing else.
Just remember when he was really that 

2887
02:01:41,371 --> 02:01:41,371
big.
There's a picture of him that doesn't

2888
02:01:41,371 --> 02:01:41,810
even look real.
It's insane.

2889
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:44,300
And nicos nicos,
oh hey,

2890
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:48,160
here's the guy wanted to do is introduce
you to in a.

2891
02:01:48,230 --> 02:01:51,080
Since then me and shane and we just 
stood toe to toe.

2892
02:01:51,081 --> 02:01:52,460
Neither one of us knew what we were 
doing,

2893
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:57,670
blasting each other and you rolled with 
that mean you had the biggest and the 

2894
02:01:57,670 --> 02:01:59,860
baddest as a training partner forever.
The best man was.

2895
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:05,000
He was like a little brother.
I couldn't afford private training with 

2896
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:05,780
trevor whitman and chain blue to me.
So much.

2897
02:02:05,781 --> 02:02:10,781
He paid for my training with trevor.
For a guy like shane having a guy like 

2898
02:02:10,781 --> 02:02:11,450
you around invaluable,
you know,

2899
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:14,770
trying to find a giant picture of me and
him in emilia.

2900
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:17,210
I think one or two fights at the time 
had zero.

2901
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:19,220
That's amazing.
Yeah.

2902
02:02:19,221 --> 02:02:21,500
And he was a really good wrestler as 
well.

2903
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,570
And his,
his issue reallY.

2904
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:25,580
He had a lot of issues from football 
health,

2905
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:28,640
brought a always neck injuries and back 
injuries.

2906
02:02:28,641 --> 02:02:31,490
He had a lot of um,
a lot of problems with his back man.

2907
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,820
You know,
the body's just not designed to have 300

2908
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:37,160
pound dudes running out.
You full clips as well.

2909
02:02:37,161 --> 02:02:40,220
It's also not designed to be 300 pounds 
and shredded muscle.

2910
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:42,770
It's just not.
That's true to anyone.

2911
02:02:42,771 --> 02:02:47,771
I know anyone,
and I know a lot of athletes like high 

2912
02:02:47,771 --> 02:02:47,771
level athletes,
anyone who's that big,

2913
02:02:47,771 --> 02:02:51,530
that lean and whether natural,
not they're always hurt,

2914
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,370
they're always heard or they always,
they're always sick for whatever reason.

2915
02:02:55,371 --> 02:02:58,330
They just have bad immune systems or 
they're fighting.

2916
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:03,400
So yeah,
that's the most ridicuLous thing I've 

2917
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:08,051
ever seen him.
That's when he was at his biggest 

2918
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:08,051
saving.
You'd find that picture.

2919
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:08,051
Jamie looks like,
hey,

2920
02:03:08,051 --> 02:03:08,870
uh,
just a bodybuilder.

2921
02:03:08,871 --> 02:03:13,871
So I googled shane carwyn huge bro.
I sparring sparring days.

2922
02:03:14,901 --> 02:03:19,670
I used to sit in my car outside the gym 
and I was so nervous,

2923
02:03:19,671 --> 02:03:20,300
man,
like,

2924
02:03:20,360 --> 02:03:21,650
dang,
I don't want to do this.

2925
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:22,850
Look at that picture.
Look at him.

2926
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,650
Get the fuck outta here.
First of all,

2927
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:26,670
does not look like a gaY porn picture.

2928
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:33,770
Pull out,
pull out his hairless car and stuff,

2929
02:03:33,771 --> 02:03:35,750
and write in your button all shaved 
down.

2930
02:03:36,970 --> 02:03:41,970
ThIs is no way.
That guy's not going to put such a 

2931
02:03:41,970 --> 02:03:43,040
monster.
It doesn't even look real.

2932
02:03:43,041 --> 02:03:44,750
That looks photoshop,
he not gabriel.

2933
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:49,751
Gonzaga was just just her.
Here's one thing I noticed about him is 

2934
02:03:50,301 --> 02:03:53,570
he's got super long arms,
a little news flash when he fought frank

2935
02:03:53,571 --> 02:03:55,340
mir,
he might've hit myths,

2936
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:56,960
I don't know,
three times.

2937
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:58,400
I really,
really just.

2938
02:03:58,430 --> 02:03:59,450
Yeah,
he was hurt.

2939
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:00,710
What was wrong with him?
Uh,

2940
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:03,050
his back is going to prom so he couldn't
train a lot.

2941
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:07,350
That's why I went after him so quick.
Maybe got that under hook,

2942
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,820
got that under hook and those upper cuts
won't drop them in.

2943
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:12,670
And he was hitting him with left to 
right.

2944
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:13,190
Yeah.
Left.

2945
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,480
Get that under hook.
Yeah.

2946
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:19,481
And he's known for his right hand and 
meanwhile he starts to him with the 

2947
02:04:19,481 --> 02:04:19,481
left.

2948
02:04:19,481 --> 02:04:22,250
He was just such a gorilla.
The poor health problems.

2949
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:23,780
Late man.
Yeah.

2950
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:26,640
But it's also just the football,
all that football.

2951
02:04:26,641 --> 02:04:28,760
I mean he had a lot of injuries from 
wrestling.

2952
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:33,761
He's just a rugged dude.
You make a real good point though about 

2953
02:04:33,761 --> 02:04:34,370
guys there are that big because 
everyone.

2954
02:04:34,371 --> 02:04:36,180
I know everyone.
I'm telling you,

2955
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,190
one of my best friends,
he was in the nfl.

2956
02:04:38,191 --> 02:04:40,120
Not anymore.
A six,

2957
02:04:40,121 --> 02:04:41,550
seven,
two 65.

2958
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:42,300
Shredded.
Right.

2959
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:44,490
He's just always been that way.
Never been on drugs,

2960
02:04:44,491 --> 02:04:46,190
nothing always hurt,
man.

2961
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,610
He had to retire because he was always 
hurt.

2962
02:04:47,910 --> 02:04:51,670
Had surgeries that kind of weight on 
your body and they're alwayS sick.

2963
02:04:51,671 --> 02:04:54,390
They're like shane was always sick.
His immune sYstem was shit,

2964
02:04:54,391 --> 02:04:56,040
man.
Shane also worked.

2965
02:04:56,100 --> 02:05:01,100
That's a hard fucking propagation of 
time job and be a professional mma 

2966
02:05:01,171 --> 02:05:03,300
fighter fighting for titles,
fighting,

2967
02:05:03,301 --> 02:05:04,620
check,
check has contended.

2968
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:06,830
Shane and I first started.
He worked you not.

2969
02:05:06,831 --> 02:05:09,660
We both worked nine to five jobs at the 
time when we very first started,

2970
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,430
nine to five jobs.
We'd both get off.

2971
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:14,190
We'd go drive straight to the gym.
He would drive an hour.

2972
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:19,300
I'd drive like 15 minutes.
You drive an hour to the gym and we 

2973
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:20,580
would be at the gym from six to 10:30
at night.

2974
02:05:20,581 --> 02:05:22,410
We'd do four classes back to back,
back.

2975
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,930
Hey,
we should do a podcast like this.

2976
02:05:24,931 --> 02:05:26,140
Like afTer ufc.
Yes,

2977
02:05:26,160 --> 02:05:28,230
we should do like one will commit to 
like one a month.

2978
02:05:28,250 --> 02:05:30,640
It's three shit man.
Let's Do it.

2979
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:33,630
This is for the.
I figured we could talk mma for days,

2980
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:37,620
throwiNg crocodiles And fucking terror 
birds,

2981
02:05:38,530 --> 02:05:43,530
joint fighter,
and the kid will do joint fighter and 

2982
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:43,530
the kid like,
this'll be one of our episodes.

2983
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:44,530
Yeah,
whatever man we can do.

2984
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:49,640
You know,
we could record it and both released 

2985
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:49,640
them simultaneously.

2986
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:49,650
We do anything.
We do whatever we want and we don't,

2987
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:52,090
but that would be really fun to break 
down fights.

2988
02:05:52,210 --> 02:05:54,570
I'm fucking pumped about tim kennedy and
michael bisping.

2989
02:05:55,260 --> 02:06:00,260
This other thing with this.
The other thing with carla and what's 

2990
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,530
weird is there's the days of carwyn 
lesnar who you just have these dudes who

2991
02:06:01,531 --> 02:06:04,430
are grill us cutting from 300 pounds of 
[inaudible].

2992
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:07,590
Sixty five [inaudible] not that way 
anymore at the big boys are gone now.

2993
02:06:07,591 --> 02:06:10,920
You guys got like cain to 40 junior dos 
santos to 40,

2994
02:06:11,420 --> 02:06:14,940
big brown to 40.
Everyone's kind of the more athletic.

2995
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,880
I agree and I think that there's a point
of diminishing return,

2996
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:18,810
right?
When you get too big,

2997
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:21,970
your body just can't keep it up.
It's just like When you saw kane.

2998
02:06:22,060 --> 02:06:25,470
I'm just running all over brock,
like the pace that he put on brock.

2999
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:30,830
First of all,
you're dealing with a brock that was 

3000
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:32,151
sick,
so it's hard to look at that like you 

3001
02:06:32,151 --> 02:06:33,030
when now that we know that the dude had 
that serious diverticulitis issue,

3002
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:35,190
but it doesn't mean you turn away from 
punches.

3003
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:37,170
Go carry on.
That's very good point.

3004
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:42,320
There's also the issue of trying to deal
with a guy who's been striking for a 

3005
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:43,630
long fucking time and you are 
essentially anonymously,

3006
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,500
right?
You knoW,

3007
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:46,500
and you can't take the guy down if you 
do take.

3008
02:06:46,501 --> 02:06:47,710
the guy did take it,
took,

3009
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:48,480
came down,
it came,

3010
02:06:48,481 --> 02:06:51,780
pops right back up to his feet.
Now you have to deal with that pace.

3011
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:53,430
Well that,
but also mentally for him,

3012
02:06:53,431 --> 02:06:55,110
he gets guys down,
they're screwed.

3013
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:56,220
Exactly.
Came down,

3014
02:06:56,221 --> 02:06:58,500
can got double risk and popped up.
Yeah.

3015
02:06:58,501 --> 02:07:00,150
And you and lazlo was like,
damn.

3016
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:02,100
You can see in his face like,
holy shit.

3017
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:03,690
That's why when he fought shane,
I was like,

3018
02:07:03,691 --> 02:07:06,390
this fights over.
This fight's over.

3019
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:09,490
And then they didn't stop at sec around 
shane just kind of get.

3020
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:11,400
Shane was dealing with some problems,
gases out.

3021
02:07:11,401 --> 02:07:13,800
Basically his body shut down on,
gets choked out.

3022
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,630
I fought on the same night,
right?

3023
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,850
Fought brock lesnar's best friend 
training partner.

3024
02:07:17,851 --> 02:07:22,851
That Was the thing,
right lesnar carwyn training partners 

3025
02:07:22,851 --> 02:07:23,430
find each other on spike the main card 
on spike.

3026
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,310
I'm not.
Chris touched her out and 50 seconds.

3027
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:28,530
I'm like,
he's a big fat slob and he's 21 though.

3028
02:07:28,531 --> 02:07:32,820
Tough dude.
Twenty one second.

3029
02:07:33,300 --> 02:07:36,430
A nice guy,
man.

3030
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:38,930
He was 20 in one though.
Yeah,

3031
02:07:39,100 --> 02:07:42,250
but I'm all excited.
I'm all excited.

3032
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:44,560
I come running back.
I'm not touching that.

3033
02:07:45,370 --> 02:07:50,370
I come back.
I come back to the locker room and then 

3034
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:51,100
shane's turned to get ready.
He's getting ready.

3035
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:53,500
I thought he was the fight one.
I was crunk right?

3036
02:07:53,501 --> 02:07:58,501
Because I want my fight.
I've never been so sad in my life when 

3037
02:07:58,501 --> 02:07:58,570
shane lost that fight because we did 
training camps together.

3038
02:07:58,571 --> 02:08:00,520
He's like a brother heavyweight 
champion.

3039
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:03,040
It didn't happen.
We're both crying,

3040
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:03,310
right?

3041
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:05,200
Both crying her eyes out in the locker 
room.

3042
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:07,660
Dana white comes in because everyone 
leaves the room.

3043
02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,840
I'm all really sharp.
You can stay like,

3044
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:12,700
thanks dana.
Shane,

3045
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:15,150
shane's literally on the floor with ice 
on his heart,

3046
02:08:15,510 --> 02:08:17,470
ice on his heart because his body's gone
crazy.

3047
02:08:17,500 --> 02:08:20,940
She's laying on the floor.
It looks like a giant gorilla.

3048
02:08:22,060 --> 02:08:23,980
And sweating,
sweating,

3049
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:26,410
ice on his heart,
on his hands all over.

3050
02:08:26,411 --> 02:08:28,300
Right.
Dana makes everyone leave the room.

3051
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:30,280
He give shane a check.
That was like,

3052
02:08:30,550 --> 02:08:31,510
what is it,
man?

3053
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:32,920
I look.
I'm like,

3054
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,690
oh shit.
Wow.

3055
02:08:34,691 --> 02:08:36,850
I popped up.
Fuck it man.

3056
02:08:36,851 --> 02:08:39,250
Let's do this.
It was a lot of money.

3057
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:40,750
I stopped crying.
So did shane.

3058
02:08:41,940 --> 02:08:43,110
Wow.
The ice bags.

3059
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,820
No,
that's real money.

3060
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:46,780
Yeah.
Wow.

3061
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:51,070
Well that was a crazy first round man.
If he pays himself and picked his shot's

3062
02:08:51,071 --> 02:08:52,600
better,
why would he though?

3063
02:08:52,601 --> 02:08:53,830
They should've stopped the fight.

3064
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:58,860
He's been to break up the fight.
I've seen fights stop for a lot less 

3065
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:01,420
cable.
When you were out that to be stopped,

3066
02:09:01,421 --> 02:09:03,520
that was you and you were okay.
Like brock was.

3067
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,710
Brock got back to his corner and he was 
all right.

3068
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:07,840
I mean he got hit with some big shots.
I agree,

3069
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:08,930
but he defended.
You know what?

3070
02:09:09,010 --> 02:09:10,990
That's when I got a lot of respect for 
brock.

3071
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:11,830
After that fight,
I was like,

3072
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:12,600
right,
he's legit.

3073
02:09:12,850 --> 02:09:13,990
He's legit.
Then I was like,

3074
02:09:13,991 --> 02:09:15,730
now sign me up.
He got rocked.

3075
02:09:15,731 --> 02:09:17,950
He got cut.
He had plenty of time to give up.

3076
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:19,900
Plenty of time to give up.
That's when you were like,

3077
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:22,480
I legit just didn't know how to deal 
with canes hands.

3078
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:25,000
Well came was just too much.
And also he was.

3079
02:09:25,690 --> 02:09:27,190
He.
He's operating in history.

3080
02:09:27,310 --> 02:09:30,640
His estimation at 40 percent.
What does that mean in the real world?

3081
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:33,130
Only he knows,
buT he definitely had diverticulitis.

3082
02:09:33,131 --> 02:09:36,060
Then even if you have 100 percent,
I agree with you.

3083
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,950
An a plus.
A plus brock.

3084
02:09:39,310 --> 02:09:44,310
Horrible matchup for.
But I think it would be a great fight 

3085
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:44,310
though.
Fun fight while it lasted,

3086
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:45,280
but I don't think they really don't 
think so.

3087
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:47,030
I don't know why because.
Because.

3088
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:49,900
Because candy canes a lot smarter,
has more tools.

3089
02:09:50,030 --> 02:09:53,800
His gas tank so much better.
I think after awhile it take its toll on

3090
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:55,570
brock and he tko them.
Time after time.

3091
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:57,880
Junior dos santos will never be the same
again.

3092
02:09:57,970 --> 02:09:59,170
I don't think so either.
No,

3093
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:03,280
never ever be the same again.
Those two fights were fucking insane.

3094
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:04,840
The corners should have threw in the 
towel.

3095
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:06,100
yeah,
well,

3096
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:07,960
you know when,
when it ended too.

3097
02:10:07,961 --> 02:10:10,660
It's crazy because it ended from him 
falling on his head.

3098
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:11,920
He,
you know,

3099
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:14,260
he got,
he got a,

3100
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:17,080
he tried to do like a power,
good teen on,

3101
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:22,140
on cain and cain ducked under and junior
was so tired and he'd taken such a 

3102
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:26,581
beating that he's holding onto this team
and he literally falls forward right 

3103
02:10:26,581 --> 02:10:27,950
onto his head and like stuns himself.

3104
02:10:27,960 --> 02:10:32,960
Then they Stopped the fight,
but the beating that he took up until 

3105
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:35,971
that,
there was three st pete times were herb 

3106
02:10:35,971 --> 02:10:38,771
dean was like moving close to stop the 
fight and then juniors heart pulled 

3107
02:10:38,771 --> 02:10:40,070
through.
It was insane.

3108
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:42,440
Junior dos santos does not fucking give 
up.

3109
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:47,470
That's one.
He had as many opportunities to give up 

3110
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:48,410
as a human being ever gets in Life and 
he will not give up.

3111
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:49,130
It's tough.
right?

3112
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:50,660
And I think about this,
it,

3113
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:54,140
it's tough because if junior came five 
years ago,

3114
02:10:54,141 --> 02:10:56,450
he's not dealing with,
he's the champ for a long time,

3115
02:10:56,750 --> 02:11:00,920
but because there's this group of guys 
and it's about matchups.

3116
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:04,100
Ufc is about matchups cain velasquez,
junior.

3117
02:11:04,101 --> 02:11:06,230
Dos santos junior will never beat them.
right.

3118
02:11:06,231 --> 02:11:07,910
He got that one lucky shot.
Other than that,

3119
02:11:08,150 --> 02:11:11,270
those guys fight 100 times.
Canes went in [inaudible] 99.

3120
02:11:11,271 --> 02:11:12,590
Usually he just,
he just.

3121
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:15,800
However,
if junior fights verdugo,

3122
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:17,390
travis brown,
he's probably gonna win.

3123
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:21,050
It's just matchups man who is a better 
match up for you for doom or,

3124
02:11:21,051 --> 02:11:21,980
or,
or um,

3125
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:23,240
uh,
alice drove,

3126
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:25,640
I mean,
that's random as hell.

3127
02:11:25,730 --> 02:11:28,010
But uh,
or who's,

3128
02:11:28,090 --> 02:11:29,030
it's just,
it's,

3129
02:11:29,070 --> 02:11:34,070
it's.
So you see a guy like allister that was 

3130
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:34,700
at a very high level and kickboxing came
over,

3131
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:36,710
fought lesnar,
looked fantastic,

3132
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:40,730
but then you see him in the big foot 
fight post getting popped.

3133
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:43,730
He got popped for testosterone.
You seem in the bigfoot fight.

3134
02:11:43,731 --> 02:11:45,140
and then you see him in the travis brown
fight.

3135
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:48,110
How much do you think he's lost from not
having?

3136
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:51,320
This is the thing though,
like he's destroying these guys,

3137
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:56,370
right,
and then you don't want to be that guy 

3138
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:56,370
in the first two minutes fighting 
alistair overeem.

3139
02:11:56,370 --> 02:12:00,530
It is a nightmare,
but he didn't fight that way against me 

3140
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:00,860
or against me or he was very controlled.

3141
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:03,140
Thanks for that fight.
They mirror.

3142
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,440
What the fuck are we doing?
What did you do?

3143
02:12:06,441 --> 02:12:08,690
All training camp.
What are we doing?

3144
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:11,450
I don't think you did nothing.
What do you say?

3145
02:12:11,470 --> 02:12:13,130
Nothing.
He didn't throw a punch.

3146
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,820
I don't think he could hit him.
I mean,

3147
02:12:14,821 --> 02:12:17,700
I think he was having a real problem.
Do something,

3148
02:12:17,720 --> 02:12:20,030
man.
I wonder what the game plan was.

3149
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:21,310
I would love to hear it.
I bet.

3150
02:12:21,410 --> 02:12:24,380
I bet the game plan was figured out how 
to tire him out and get them down to the

3151
02:12:24,381 --> 02:12:25,930
ground.
I bet that was probably the game plan.

3152
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:29,210
Stay on the outside was be very 
conservative.

3153
02:12:29,260 --> 02:12:34,260
Don't gas out.
And [inaudible] is also controlling on 

3154
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:34,260
the ground.
You know,

3155
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,150
he wasn't afraid of going to the 
controller the heck out of them,

3156
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,590
which is pretty shocking,
you know,

3157
02:12:36,591 --> 02:12:39,650
ran frank's a hell of a grappler and 
really good off his back.

3158
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:41,040
People forget that.
Alister one,

3159
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:42,170
the uh,
abu dhabi,

3160
02:12:42,171 --> 02:12:46,110
a european trials though alastair can 
the nasty canteen.

3161
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:51,180
Yeah.
He admitted vitara submitted veto with 

3162
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:51,180
geese submitted.
Mark hunt via camera.

3163
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:52,100
Yeah,
that's right.

3164
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:54,510
And a weird one too.
I told him if he needed,

3165
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:56,750
I would open up a jujitsu school farm in
New Zealand.

3166
02:12:56,810 --> 02:12:58,940
So yeah.
So we had an idea what's going on on the

3167
02:12:58,941 --> 02:12:59,810
ground.
Well,

3168
02:12:59,811 --> 02:13:04,811
didn't you guys make some sort of a bet 
like you would try to knock him out and 

3169
02:13:04,811 --> 02:13:05,180
he would try to submit you wasn't there 
something along those lines.

3170
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:10,350
We need him.
We're talking smack on twitter and then 

3171
02:13:10,350 --> 02:13:12,641
we got into this winner takes all and he
started clowning and how he's getting 

3172
02:13:12,641 --> 02:13:13,760
knocked me out and stand up.
Fighter and the kid.

3173
02:13:14,300 --> 02:13:15,820
Come on,
stand on your big letters.

3174
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:17,610
I was like,
what's wrong with your list?

3175
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,990
Your leg to stand on your big lips and 
knock you out.

3176
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:22,850
I think kids.
Could you talk a lot?

3177
02:13:24,110 --> 02:13:25,460
That's probably.
I have big lips,

3178
02:13:25,461 --> 02:13:29,090
so it's confusing.
You have a good day.

3179
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:31,510
I wouldn't say that like really big.
I met a lot of black.

3180
02:13:34,530 --> 02:13:37,170
I wouldn't describe you that way.
Like would describe brenden's shop.

3181
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:37,980
Oh,
The lips.

3182
02:13:39,410 --> 02:13:41,250
Big lips.
Describe ms dot big brown.

3183
02:13:41,530 --> 02:13:44,100
Me and him got on it on twitter.
Trying to get his name and trying to get

3184
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:45,910
his nickname change from hybrid to big 
brown.

3185
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:47,880
This guy starts with big brown,
big brown.

3186
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:49,950
He's big brown.
He's just big and brown.

3187
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:51,730
That's why everybody calls him big 
brown.

3188
02:13:51,731 --> 02:13:54,690
Now he's walking with nationality.
What's your nationality?

3189
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:58,140
My mom's full blooded english.
It's bullshit.

3190
02:13:58,170 --> 02:14:00,630
Born and raised in a patchy.
Born and raised in jewish,

3191
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:02,580
german.
A little bit of talent.

3192
02:14:02,581 --> 02:14:04,920
French native american and jewish.
100 percent.

3193
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,230
I don't care what anybody says.
You got some.

3194
02:14:07,270 --> 02:14:09,900
Do you ever do you genome test to see if
anybody's lying?

3195
02:14:09,990 --> 02:14:13,920
No.
I need to know.

3196
02:14:15,250 --> 02:14:20,250
Your dad looks exactly like the crying 
indian from those commercials in the 

3197
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:24,951
seventies and even got watery eyes by 
the way.

3198
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:27,930
Going missing is,
is the braids and the long hair.

3199
02:14:27,940 --> 02:14:32,940
Well,
here's something to consider when 

3200
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:34,071
someone talks about someone being german
or someone being italian or something 

3201
02:14:34,071 --> 02:14:34,071
being anYthing,
um,

3202
02:14:34,071 --> 02:14:34,920
yeah,
maybe,

3203
02:14:34,950 --> 02:14:37,350
but who knows how they got to Germany or
Italy,

3204
02:14:37,351 --> 02:14:42,351
17 generations before.
Who knows where any of those people came

3205
02:14:42,751 --> 02:14:47,751
from.
All lead back to like some africans you 

3206
02:14:47,751 --> 02:14:52,460
did not.
You didn't tell them what to tell a 

3207
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:52,460
story about.
Well,

3208
02:14:52,460 --> 02:14:52,650
from about Cuba,
kimbo slice,

3209
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:56,070
kimbo slice on ultimate fighter guys for
doing that.

3210
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:59,010
Even show this on the air.
So this guy,

3211
02:14:59,011 --> 02:15:00,570
I'm not going to mention his name on the
show.

3212
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:03,150
He lost and you can drink all that 
alcohol you want in the house.

3213
02:15:03,360 --> 02:15:05,550
And there's only at the time there's 
only four of us left.

3214
02:15:05,551 --> 02:15:07,710
Still fighting.
Roy marcus jones.

3215
02:15:07,890 --> 02:15:11,260
I'm mitch,
mitch mitrione and uh,

3216
02:15:11,370 --> 02:15:12,780
myself.
That's the for fighting,

3217
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:13,020
right?

3218
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:15,780
So one of the guys,
one of the other guys just hammered,

3219
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,070
hammered.
He's lost,

3220
02:15:17,071 --> 02:15:17,850
right?
Hammered,

3221
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:23,060
wasted.
All of a sudden this guy gets super 

3222
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:24,060
racist in the house and there's a whole 
bunch of black guys in the house.

3223
02:15:24,290 --> 02:15:29,290
Starts talking out how his wife loves 
them because the korean nation and 

3224
02:15:29,290 --> 02:15:31,050
starts throwing up racial slurs and 
throwing up these,

3225
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:34,560
you know the hey hitler stuff heil 
hitler started his name on this piece of

3226
02:15:34,561 --> 02:15:37,000
paper for me.
All right dude.

3227
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,520
Dude,
this isn't getting out though,

3228
02:15:38,521 --> 02:15:41,250
right?
I need to know for my own edification.

3229
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:43,800
So he starts doing all this stuff.
I'm sleeping.

3230
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,650
I've the biggest fight of mY life.
The next day.

3231
02:15:46,710 --> 02:15:49,140
Dana white literally stops us in the 
condos.

3232
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:52,080
Listen,
if whoever makes the finale,

3233
02:15:52,090 --> 02:15:53,250

02:15:56,310 --> 02:15:57,540
You guys want to win this fight?

3237
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:58,710
Thank you.
No pressure.

3238
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:04,010
So I'm sleeping and I'm sleeping and uh,

3239
02:16:09,460 --> 02:16:11,790

3246
02:16:26,721 --> 02:16:26,721

We're about to jack them up.

3249
02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:33,940
I literally thought it was in,

3250
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:35,650
it's talking about our people.
Dog.

3251
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:39,010
Let's go f this dude up and like,

3252
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:40,560

3253
02:16:40,590 --> 02:16:45,590
I said I'm,
I'm told I'm not down with the race 

3254
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:45,590
thing.
I'm totally down to fuck this dude up,

3255
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:45,590
but you realize I'm not black.
Right?

3256
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:48,810
Kim goes,
he goes,

3257
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:50,770
damn,
that's crazy.

3258
02:16:51,210 --> 02:16:54,040
Turn around leaving out here.
That's why I locked shop.

3259
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:55,270
You can't tell what the hell he is.

3260
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,420
My I.
Hey kimbo,

3261
02:17:01,690 --> 02:17:06,690
that's racist dog while you're just 
because I'm athletic and can file you 

3262
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:06,690
gotta be black.
He goes,

3263
02:17:06,690 --> 02:17:11,100
you could be.
Wow.

3264
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:16,110
That's interesting man.
That's crazy weird situation to be in to

3265
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:19,240
what a trained seller is also an area 
nation guy.

3266
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:21,610
Or is he miked up?
All this is going on to.

3267
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:26,110
He's miked up and they have to ask why 
didn't they put that on the show?

3268
02:17:26,530 --> 02:17:27,820
Oh,
that's not good for rating.

3269
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:28,810
Fuck yeah,
it is.

3270
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:30,130
No,
are you kidding me?

3271
02:17:30,310 --> 02:17:31,870
Oh wait,
didn't show any of it,

3272
02:17:31,871 --> 02:17:33,550
man.
That guy never fight again.

3273
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:35,180
Diddy,
diddy?

3274
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:37,030
No.
Hm.

3275
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,560
Interesting.
Too many clues.

3276
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:40,630
We know people gonna know who this is.
They'll figure it out.

3277
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:43,090
Tough shirt.
That's fascinating.

3278
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:45,490
Bad news six years ago.
Yeah.

3279
02:17:45,491 --> 02:17:46,690
They have to make a deCisioN,
right?

3280
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:49,390
Whether you put that oN the tv or not,
we didn't need it though.

3281
02:17:49,390 --> 02:17:53,050
The ratings were so high and then you 
want to toss some highest ratings ever.

3282
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,010
By the way.
Tough 10.

3283
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:56,050
Woo.
Was it really the highest ratings ever?

3284
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:58,960
Nothing's even kimbo slice.
Slice and that crazy.

3285
02:17:58,961 --> 02:18:00,210
I'll never forget man,
when you,

3286
02:18:00,380 --> 02:18:02,200
when we walked in the house,
right?

3287
02:18:02,440 --> 02:18:03,830
Or walk whacking the gym,
you're staring.

3288
02:18:03,831 --> 02:18:04,320
And I'm like,
oh,

3289
02:18:04,330 --> 02:18:06,820
I don't know.
I don't know any of these guys in wax.

3290
02:18:06,821 --> 02:18:08,760
Roy nelson on their for matt mitrione 
goes,

3291
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:11,440
we'll look at the fat ass.
I'm off bro.

3292
02:18:11,441 --> 02:18:13,030
That's Roy Nelson.
He was suicidal.

3293
02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:15,420
He was winning a world champion.
And I have.

3294
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:17,860
It was like 30 fights.
What the fuck?

3295
02:18:18,100 --> 02:18:20,350
And roy and matt's like,
that's nothing man.

3296
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:23,050
And then dana was hyping up everyone 
going,

3297
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:28,090
do you realize there's 15 guys here?
There's 16 total though.

3298
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:31,390
So we're bringing a special guests.
They hype this thing up.

3299
02:18:31,391 --> 02:18:32,290
Everyone's wondering everyone.

3300
02:18:32,710 --> 02:18:34,150
I leaned over to roy go,
bro,

3301
02:18:34,240 --> 02:18:39,240
you know what?
The route to bring you in and there's 

3302
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:39,240
big talks at the time.
Can you imagine if they did this?

3303
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:39,860
I said fear doors to walk through that 
motherfucker.

3304
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:41,860
Ross screwed.
I have three fights,

3305
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:47,070
the three fatal disaster and that's why.
That's why when they bring them in and 

3306
02:18:49,031 --> 02:18:54,031
in watts,
kimbo slice I thought was me fade or 

3307
02:18:54,031 --> 02:18:54,520
that's why I looked over at manly.
Oh fuck.

3308
02:18:54,521 --> 02:18:59,521
Kimbo slice and that's the very first 
way people saw me on national tv is me 

3309
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:00,730
saying,
fuck kimbo slice.

3310
02:19:00,880 --> 02:19:03,820
That's hilarious.
I thought it was gonna be feared or man,

3311
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:05,390
I was all nervous.
I really thought I was going,

3312
02:19:06,280 --> 02:19:08,320
oh my god,
somebody needs to talk to you.

3313
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:10,600
why would feed or do the ultimate 
fighter?

3314
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:15,690
I don't know.
Maybe they pay them like a million 

3315
02:19:15,690 --> 02:19:17,940
dollars and he's like,
can you just tear up these kids with 

3316
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:17,940
three fights?
you know what's crazy?

3317
02:19:17,940 --> 02:19:18,100
Which really see.
That'd be funny.

3318
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:23,760
Crazy though.
is there kimbo slice would get more 

3319
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:23,760
readings at where?
Here it's weird.

3320
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,650
More people know who kimbo slice was 
back then because of youtube,

3321
02:19:25,651 --> 02:19:28,040
like the casual persOn then knew who

3322
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:29,360
fader was.
I'll tell you what,

3323
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:32,000
kimbo one of the nicest people have a 
very nice guy.

3324
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,560
So cool.
Yeah.

3325
02:19:33,620 --> 02:19:37,910
Tommy out a fight with a shank.
What damage it rules?

3326
02:19:38,150 --> 02:19:43,150
Well,
you leave this arm so they can scrape 

3327
02:19:43,150 --> 02:19:44,801
that.
I'm going to get the knife and this one 

3328
02:19:44,801 --> 02:19:44,801
man,
that's dope.

3329
02:19:44,801 --> 02:19:44,801
While he was barbecuing,
he needs,

3330
02:19:45,250 --> 02:19:46,610
if he's listening,
he needs to open up.

3331
02:19:46,611 --> 02:19:49,540
Is a barbecue restaurant.
Kimbos man.

3332
02:19:49,541 --> 02:19:51,200
Like I could grill like no one's 
business.

3333
02:19:51,560 --> 02:19:54,530
He'd make this barbecue sauce and he'd 
make his own sauce,

3334
02:19:54,830 --> 02:19:57,560
but we put in it.
You have the honey mustard,

3335
02:19:57,561 --> 02:19:59,150
all sorts of stuff.
So you just knew it.

3336
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:01,490
He knew what he was doing.
What kind of.

3337
02:20:01,491 --> 02:20:04,100
What did he barbecue ribs,
ribs.

3338
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:06,210
I mean cakes.
Oh dude,

3339
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:07,820
he's a chemist.
A chemist.

3340
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,490
He was.
He was so cooL,

3341
02:20:09,500 --> 02:20:10,670
man.
He was so cool.

3342
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:11,660
Good eaten.
Yeah,

3343
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:12,200
he is.

3344
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:15,170
He is just a natural athlete.
I mean he's just big strong guy.

3345
02:20:15,171 --> 02:20:16,820
He's got some serious knee problems,
man.

3346
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,010
I Wouldn't come with that.
yeah,

3347
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:19,760
yeah.
I will say he's a natural athlete.

3348
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:21,020
Well,
he's a tough guy.

3349
02:20:21,290 --> 02:20:24,200
Tough guy.
Real real knee problems are bone on bone

3350
02:20:24,201 --> 02:20:26,720
arthritis in his knees.
That's why I left mma.

3351
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:29,080
Do you try to do some boxing and he 
renting?

3352
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:32,000
We wasn't winning,
but he made some improvement.

3353
02:20:32,001 --> 02:20:34,670
He definitely made some improvement,
but it was the knees.

3354
02:20:34,730 --> 02:20:37,290
His knees were fucked.
You weren't going to get better.

3355
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,380
They made some money.
He made some money.

3356
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:42,740
He makes a ton of money as security for 
ic mc and reality.

3357
02:20:42,750 --> 02:20:44,930
Kings porno,
his best friend is ic.

3358
02:20:44,931 --> 02:20:47,900
mc reality kings.
Holla at your boy.

3359
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,430
I wonder if they're making any money 
more.

3360
02:20:49,610 --> 02:20:51,930
is it tough to make money in the world 
now,

3361
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:53,210
right?
Like you.

3362
02:20:53,270 --> 02:20:58,270
You porn.
Why am I going to pay us the 

3363
02:20:58,270 --> 02:20:58,270
subscription reality kings?
Yeah,

3364
02:20:58,270 --> 02:21:01,601
that's the thing.
You have to be like a real fan to pay a 

3365
02:21:01,601 --> 02:21:05,660
real cycle.
I think they make money and you went 

3366
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:07,220
with a real cycle jacket off about 10 
times a day,

3367
02:21:07,540 --> 02:21:12,540
your membership,
but there are dudes that become like 

3368
02:21:12,540 --> 02:21:13,460
fans of a girl just like they become 
fans of a band.

3369
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:18,490
Again,
if you'Re my friend and you're a fan of 

3370
02:21:18,490 --> 02:21:18,590
a girl and you pay for a membership,
lose my number.

3371
02:21:19,950 --> 02:21:24,950
If you don't make kids or if you're fan 
of girls whose know if you pay for a 

3372
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:28,250
membership because you liked one certain
porno star,

3373
02:21:28,280 --> 02:21:33,280
you're a psycho.
Where there's some guys that have very 

3374
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:33,280
specific tastes like they only like 
asian broads.

3375
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:38,030
That's it.
Asian girls only like porno asian and 

3376
02:21:38,030 --> 02:21:38,410
opportunity employer.
Me too.

3377
02:21:38,411 --> 02:21:39,600
I hate.
Yeah.

3378
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:44,610
I encourage everybody.
How about guYs who say they never jerk 

3379
02:21:44,610 --> 02:21:45,920
off to porn?
Ever lie.

3380
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:49,730
They don't use porn and if they jerk off
it's to their imagination.

3381
02:21:50,300 --> 02:21:51,230
Again,
lose my number.

3382
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:56,300
They're lying for sure.
I don't know.

3383
02:21:56,301 --> 02:22:00,470
I think some people actually do have a 
problem with porn.

3384
02:22:00,471 --> 02:22:02,510
They don't like it.
They don't like the fact that they think

3385
02:22:02,511 --> 02:22:05,270
that people being victimized in some way
that you know.

3386
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:07,280
I've never met her guys making a lot of 
money.

3387
02:22:07,281 --> 02:22:08,150
I have.
I definitely.

3388
02:22:08,151 --> 02:22:08,670
Really?
Yeah.

3389
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,520
Yeah.
I've met people.

3390
02:22:10,030 --> 02:22:11,480
Hate said this,
but I watched.

3391
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:13,310
I hate to say this.
I watched.

3392
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:18,400
I watched him lecture.
Please sit dotcom called why I stopped 

3393
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:19,910
watching porn and it's really,
really eloquent.

3394
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,590
Dude was talking about why it's damaging
and ever since I listened,

3395
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:26,250
it's almost like now that I know 
football causes head injuries,

3396
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:31,430
it's literally don't be so well known 
and the reason why cast is so good.

3397
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:39,210
You guys balance each other out so well.
I was telling brian,

3398
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:44,360
someone needs to be in the room with him
to let him be him because if you leave 

3399
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:44,940
him by himself,
he goes,

3400
02:22:45,210 --> 02:22:47,280
by the way,
throw once,

3401
02:22:47,281 --> 02:22:52,000
theorized that the reason why this 
passion exists.

3402
02:22:52,001 --> 02:22:57,001
No,
he called me up because he heard the 

3403
02:22:57,001 --> 02:22:57,001
year and me doing the elliot health 
thing and he goes,

3404
02:22:57,001 --> 02:22:57,001
hey bro.
He goes,

3405
02:22:57,001 --> 02:23:01,521
let me ask you one of the funniest 
people I know so many should show you 

3406
02:23:01,521 --> 02:23:03,060
for ms dot represent who you really are 
on your podcast.

3407
02:23:04,770 --> 02:23:07,290
You should see yourself.
Just be funny,

3408
02:23:07,291 --> 02:23:08,940
brian.
I hate when you're serious.

3409
02:23:08,941 --> 02:23:11,940
Brian.
I didn't say hate when you're serious,

3410
02:23:11,941 --> 02:23:12,450
brian.
I said,

3411
02:23:12,451 --> 02:23:14,280
you're two different people.
I said,

3412
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:18,000
there's you who's really you and there's
you and it goes into lecture mode.

3413
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:20,100
Why am I doing that?
I don't even know why.

3414
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:20,910
Why don't know.
I mean,

3415
02:23:20,911 --> 02:23:24,540
I guess probably everybody does it.
I'm sure I'd do it to a certain extent,

3416
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:29,310
but you do it smart people.
You don't know what he did it.

3417
02:23:29,360 --> 02:23:31,680
You know what?
He did it on our biggest podcasts when I

3418
02:23:31,681 --> 02:23:33,540
resigned my new ufc contract.
I go,

3419
02:23:33,541 --> 02:23:35,490
dana,
I'm going to come and sign my contract.

3420
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:40,580
You mind if you're on my podcast?
You did that with dana white in his 

3421
02:23:40,580 --> 02:23:40,680
office and his office.
Brian.

3422
02:23:40,840 --> 02:23:42,240
He goes,
Mr.

3423
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,580
White,
where did you get your inspiration from?

3424
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:47,550
Michael?
Let's call him mr wang.

3425
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:50,010
First of all,
I just didn't know him.

3426
02:23:50,050 --> 02:23:55,050
No I didn't,
but I didn't know his story for the 

3427
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:55,050
story.
I did,

3428
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:58,100
but I didn't know him so I didn't know 
whether he had a son to him with me 

3429
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:58,100
before.
You're not really like,

3430
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:59,610
you know,
talk to them and now.

3431
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,100
Now I know he loves.
He's.

3432
02:24:01,370 --> 02:24:06,370
He's gone.
It's gone back to the porno stars 

3433
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:09,261
though.
I got a buddy who'S dating what he did 

3434
02:24:09,261 --> 02:24:10,620
during the podcast,
so like made you a fighter and a kid.

3435
02:24:11,970 --> 02:24:16,480
Did you ever talk a little bit?
It was just so like the reason,

3436
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:18,900
the reason why the fighter and the kid 
works.

3437
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:20,390
You fuck it up?
No,

3438
02:24:20,391 --> 02:24:20,680
no,
no.

3439
02:24:20,681 --> 02:24:25,681
I just.
The reason why the fire code works is 

3440
02:24:25,681 --> 02:24:25,681
because we get serious people,
right?

3441
02:24:25,681 --> 02:24:25,681
And we're clowns,
man.

3442
02:24:25,710 --> 02:24:27,840
We get them out of the elements.
We make things fun.

3443
02:24:27,850 --> 02:24:29,850
We tell him we did a great one.
Ronda rousey recently,

3444
02:24:29,870 --> 02:24:32,070
we.
We tell stories with dana.

3445
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:35,460
He was like,
where do you see yourself in 10 years?

3446
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:38,630
No way.
You really don't know what I'm saying.

3447
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:40,680
Questions like that.
What are you at chick?

3448
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:45,740
We have really good arguments that on 
the podcast we have serious arguments 

3449
02:24:45,740 --> 02:24:48,660
about like whether or not ron should 
take me or him on this abi apocalypse,

3450
02:24:48,661 --> 02:24:49,510
all kinds of stuff.

3451
02:24:49,620 --> 02:24:51,990
She's stating the obvious.
That wasn't much of an argument.

3452
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:53,960
I don't want to have a conversation when
you going to provide.

3453
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:54,620
I said,
I said,

3454
02:24:55,250 --> 02:25:00,250
I said I would take a tim kennedy's,
you know the poisonous mushrooms or 

3455
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:00,250
something.
I do.

3456
02:25:00,250 --> 02:25:02,250
I know a lot of stuff,
but you would take tim kennedy.

3457
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:07,310
I said,
tim kennedy and I immediately regretted 

3458
02:25:07,310 --> 02:25:09,581
saying as soon as that,
because they gave a scenario where all 

3459
02:25:09,581 --> 02:25:10,050
the zombies,
everyone's a zombie,

3460
02:25:10,051 --> 02:25:12,780
so it's only you and one other person,
so we couldn't procreate.

3461
02:25:12,781 --> 02:25:13,050
Right,
right.

3462
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:15,480
You don't want to take him.
I'm pregnant.

3463
02:25:15,510 --> 02:25:16,160
Rhonda.
Saturday.

3464
02:25:16,161 --> 02:25:16,800
Yeah.
Rhonda goes,

3465
02:25:16,801 --> 02:25:18,330
I'd be a good breeding.
She said,

3466
02:25:19,380 --> 02:25:20,910
your army,
you need a breeding.

3467
02:25:20,911 --> 02:25:22,770
That's true.
You'd be breeding warriors.

3468
02:25:22,790 --> 02:25:24,010
Yeah.
That's a good move.

3469
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:29,040
Yeah.
She's the only choice there a couple of 

3470
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:29,040
other choices,
but for you,

3471
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:29,040
that's the only choice.
You can't take.

3472
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:32,110
Tim kennedy can't get them pregnant.
If you were the only two people on earth

3473
02:25:32,111 --> 02:25:34,790
and yet to fucking die and leave your 
kids to fend for themselves again,

3474
02:25:34,791 --> 02:25:39,791
zombies.
You might want to take everybody out in 

3475
02:25:39,791 --> 02:25:41,671
their sleep and then do yourself.
You might want to fucking end it for 

3476
02:25:41,671 --> 02:25:45,990
real.
If you're the last two people on earth 

3477
02:25:45,990 --> 02:25:47,731
and the world is not drown,
swim out as far as you can go.

3478
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,490
That's what I say.
just call it out.

3479
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:52,590
Fuck that last person on earth being a 
human being.

3480
02:25:52,600 --> 02:25:55,240
I know I'm not taking a foxhole.
Youtube.

3481
02:25:55,420 --> 02:25:58,250
As soon as things get a little shady,
that's a foxhole.

3482
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:03,910
He shot himself foxholes a war.
We're talking about everybody being dead

3483
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:05,530
except for you in this one chick.

3484
02:26:05,830 --> 02:26:08,150
What kind of life is that?
Your baby behind.

3485
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:10,630
You're going to have to fuck your kids.
Do you understand that?

3486
02:26:10,631 --> 02:26:15,631
How procreation works.
Someone's going to have to fuck your 

3487
02:26:15,631 --> 02:26:15,631
kids.
Your kids are gonna.

3488
02:26:15,631 --> 02:26:15,631
Have to fuck each other.
No,

3489
02:26:15,850 --> 02:26:20,850
that'd Be the garden.
They're going to have to try to survive 

3490
02:26:20,850 --> 02:26:20,850
and they still might get eaten by 
zombies.

3491
02:26:20,850 --> 02:26:21,940
Will you guys were given up,
but what are you gonna do?

3492
02:26:21,970 --> 02:26:26,970
You're gonna fuck your kids.
You got to keep the reader in a way for 

3493
02:26:26,970 --> 02:26:27,520
other people.
Okay.

3494
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:29,770
That's what I'm saying.
If you know for sure,

3495
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:32,890
you'd have to know for sure.
Kelly,

3496
02:26:32,900 --> 02:26:35,140
yourself or you just figure out what 
this is.

3497
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:36,790
I'm here for a reason.
What is it?

3498
02:26:36,970 --> 02:26:38,520
Maybe I can figure something out point 
though.

3499
02:26:38,530 --> 02:26:43,530
You wouldn't really know if you know,
but you two are given up like I am 

3500
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:43,530
legend.

3501
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:43,530
No,
I am.

3502
02:26:43,530 --> 02:26:44,940
Legend was really like the walking dead,
right,

3503
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:47,830
the camp at the end and everybody was 
safe,

3504
02:26:48,400 --> 02:26:50,440
but those monsters is way scarier than 
the walking dead.

3505
02:26:51,010 --> 02:26:52,300
Dead.
Sign me up.

3506
02:26:52,301 --> 02:26:54,360
I'm just going to run everywhere they 
walk in.

3507
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:57,820
I'm going to run it my mind.
I'm going to cut down to about one 70.

3508
02:26:57,910 --> 02:27:02,910
I'm gonna.
have a nice pair of kicks and I'm just 

3509
02:27:02,910 --> 02:27:02,910
going to run every cardio,
cardio,

3510
02:27:04,470 --> 02:27:07,720
cardio.
That shows a little too moody for me.

3511
02:27:08,080 --> 02:27:10,000
It's getting ridiculous.
They're eating people now.

3512
02:27:10,001 --> 02:27:12,700
It's like they've found a cannibal 
fucking colony.

3513
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:16,330
it makes sense I guess,
but there's plenty of deer left to.

3514
02:27:16,331 --> 02:27:18,680
It's not like the zombies are eating 
deer or they eat a few of them,

3515
02:27:18,681 --> 02:27:23,681
but they can't catch him.
I don't understand why everybody gets 

3516
02:27:23,681 --> 02:27:24,250
guns when he could have a sword.
I mean it's good to have guns,

3517
02:27:24,251 --> 02:27:27,350
but that chick never gets fucked with 
jacks.

3518
02:27:27,560 --> 02:27:29,860
Everything will you run out of bullets 
with a sword.

3519
02:27:29,861 --> 02:27:31,170
You're just chopping heads off.
Yeah.

3520
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:32,930
You can get a reload.
The rifle.

3521
02:27:33,370 --> 02:27:38,370
It takes a couple of seconds.
You gotta fucking 100 zombies coming at 

3522
02:27:38,370 --> 02:27:41,611
you.
It takes a long time to put 100 bullets 

3523
02:27:41,611 --> 02:27:43,621
in the chamber.
100 zombies are coming into may take a 

3524
02:27:43,621 --> 02:27:44,350
sword and start to swing it around.
Fuck yeah.

3525
02:27:44,351 --> 02:27:49,351
You take a couple at a tIme and you do 
it for about an hour and you got 100 

3526
02:27:49,351 --> 02:27:49,351
dead until you get,
until you get the zombie.

3527
02:27:49,351 --> 02:27:54,121
Like shane carlin,
who knows single legs sambisa don't 

3528
02:27:54,121 --> 02:27:54,121
learn anything.
They don't even know how to use doors.

3529
02:27:54,121 --> 02:27:55,780
You don't pay attention.
You don't even watch that show.

3530
02:27:55,781 --> 02:28:00,781
You can't be in this conference.
Please exit the conversation so they 

3531
02:28:00,781 --> 02:28:02,650
don't even know unscrewed doors in world
war ii,

3532
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:05,110
world war z,
little different.

3533
02:28:06,530 --> 02:28:08,300
Those are the scary fast zombie.

3534
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:09,790
Yes.
that's where we're all screwed.

3535
02:28:09,791 --> 02:28:12,730
The scary zombies of all time with the 
28 days later zombies.

3536
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:14,320
You remember that?
Not only that,

3537
02:28:14,321 --> 02:28:18,580
because that's the most likely scenario.
It was z.

3538
02:28:18,580 --> 02:28:21,890
They called it rage.
A genetIcally created disease,

3539
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:27,040
modify disease.
A weaponized disease escapes from the 

3540
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,520
chimps and gets into people and then 
spreads like wildfire.

3541
02:28:28,750 --> 02:28:32,780
When you think about what rabies does to
to animals and people and people,

3542
02:28:32,840 --> 02:28:37,840
people,
if somebody has rabies and you get them 

3543
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:37,840
near a body of water,
if they get near a body of water,

3544
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,620
they get so hysterical.
You have to chain them down.

3545
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:41,060
Really allude.
That will go.

3546
02:28:41,061 --> 02:28:42,380
Why water?
I don't know.

3547
02:28:42,470 --> 02:28:43,820
Are you making this up?
Water.

3548
02:28:43,821 --> 02:28:45,820
Water.
They get crazy.

3549
02:28:45,910 --> 02:28:48,850
Like a huge water phobia from.
Oh,

3550
02:28:48,851 --> 02:28:52,250
they get afraid of the water.
When's the last time someone got rabies?

3551
02:28:52,640 --> 02:28:56,030
Rabies vaccines.
Rabies was,

3552
02:28:56,060 --> 02:28:57,420
You know,
I'm talking to now.

3553
02:28:58,040 --> 02:29:00,260
People have gotten it really recently.
Been bit by animals.

3554
02:29:00,270 --> 02:29:05,270
Yeah.
I wonder if rabies Comes from an animal 

3555
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:05,270
and that animal has memories of 
drowning.

3556
02:29:05,270 --> 02:29:05,900
Look it up.
Look up.

3557
02:29:05,930 --> 02:29:07,760
Imagine that shit like we,
we're talking about the,

3558
02:29:07,761 --> 02:29:08,450
the,
with the,

3559
02:29:08,451 --> 02:29:09,260
uh,
the mice,

3560
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:14,380
the mice giving the,
the remembering the smell with the shop 

3561
02:29:14,380 --> 02:29:15,410
part of Your brain where you actually go
crazy.

3562
02:29:15,411 --> 02:29:16,730
First of all,
you crazy.

3563
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:19,070
That's why the animal will bite you.
TheY go crazy.

3564
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:21,920
They start to drool and they're just 
very aggressive.

3565
02:29:22,050 --> 02:29:23,240
I'm not,
I'm not making this up.

3566
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:26,210
I had a dog bite me in the ass chicken 
had rabies when I was a kid.

3567
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:31,300
Really?
You to get a bunch of shots and guess 

3568
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:31,300
what?
I'm not scared of dogs.

3569
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:33,140
you had to get shots in the stomach.
The right dog.

3570
02:29:33,141 --> 02:29:35,130
she'd be scared of snakes.
you ever put a.

3571
02:29:35,131 --> 02:29:39,730
I put a bite suit on and Afghanistan.
It had dogs and I've done enough.

3572
02:29:39,740 --> 02:29:41,560
God,
I hate it too.

3573
02:29:42,110 --> 02:29:45,950
Honestly.
Switches it up to see if he's around.

3574
02:29:46,160 --> 02:29:48,800
By the way,
if he's around like real military guys,

3575
02:29:48,801 --> 02:29:52,830
he takes that shit down.
A few doesn't go up.

3576
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:55,050
Then they'll go,
what do you like?

3577
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:57,230
Silence.
They think I'm a plant.

3578
02:29:57,410 --> 02:29:58,620
They think I'm about keto plan.
Like,

3579
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:00,740
no,
they don't think you're a plant.

3580
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:02,180
They think you're a fraud.

3581
02:30:04,410 --> 02:30:07,540
You're a plant.
They put a plant on match day.

3582
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:09,140
I lived in the middle east eight years 
of my life.

3583
02:30:09,141 --> 02:30:10,650
Don't blame me,
but um,

3584
02:30:10,690 --> 02:30:15,690
it's done.
Do they release these hydrophobia fear 

3585
02:30:15,690 --> 02:30:15,690
of water.
Historic name for rabies.

3586
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:18,950
Wow.
It's the historic name for rabies refers

3587
02:30:18,951 --> 02:30:23,951
to a set of symptoms.
The later stages of an infection with 

3588
02:30:23,951 --> 02:30:27,011
the victims has difficulty swallowing.
Shows panic when presented with liquids 

3589
02:30:27,011 --> 02:30:29,270
to drink and can't quench thirst.
Wow.

3590
02:30:29,271 --> 02:30:34,271
So I guess that's what it is.
Like they're scared of water because 

3591
02:30:34,271 --> 02:30:34,271
they know that they got it in their 
mouth.

3592
02:30:34,271 --> 02:30:36,440
To suggest I'm drinking may cause 
excruciating,

3593
02:30:36,441 --> 02:30:39,020
painful spasms of the muscles in the 
throat and learn.

3594
02:30:39,050 --> 02:30:44,050
Wow.
Suggestion of drinking may cause 

3595
02:30:44,050 --> 02:30:44,240
excrutiatingly painful spasms and you're
really thirsty.

3596
02:30:44,241 --> 02:30:45,770
Yet you're really thirsty.
Great disease,

3597
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:48,650
vaccines,
vaccines.

3598
02:30:48,651 --> 02:30:49,370
Yeah,
thank you.

3599
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:54,400
The effect they can shoot you when you 
get a bit horrible needles in their 

3600
02:30:54,400 --> 02:30:54,840
stomach.
You know,

3601
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:56,810
a big giant needles in your fucking 
stomach.

3602
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:59,720
This is another reallY bad,
you know the symptoms of tetanus.

3603
02:31:00,380 --> 02:31:02,480
Look those up.
Look up the symptoms of tetanus.

3604
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:06,620
That is the worst.
Your whole body seizes up and before you

3605
02:31:06,621 --> 02:31:11,621
die,
you're very acutely aware of all the 

3606
02:31:11,621 --> 02:31:13,211
pain that he didn't.
You see this shit where a jon jones is 

3607
02:31:13,211 --> 02:31:13,670
requesting that glover to share,
get drug tested?

3608
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:16,640
Oh no.
It's kind of fascinating.

3609
02:31:16,970 --> 02:31:17,750
He says,
uh,

3610
02:31:17,751 --> 02:31:19,890
agree to a lot of testing.
Well,

3611
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,070
this is what he says.
This is exact quote is some fighters you

3612
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:25,530
just know they're not on anything just 
by looking at them.

3613
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:30,800
I kind of disagree with that because 
like guys like that look like Jeremy 

3614
02:31:30,800 --> 02:31:33,120
Horn who doesn't look like he's on 
anything who have tested positive,

3615
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:38,270
like just because a guy has like a 
certain body type doesn't mean that he 

3616
02:31:38,270 --> 02:31:39,180
can't be on something like got a lot of 
guys have tested positive.

3617
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:43,260
I think you're taLking about the 
exception there again perhaps,

3618
02:31:43,380 --> 02:31:45,900
but those are often the guys that wand 
up taking it like,

3619
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,070
okay,
here's a perfect example,

3620
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:49,780
tim silvia.
There's tips a lot of folks don't know,

3621
02:31:49,781 --> 02:31:53,370
like tim silvia tested hot and before 
tim silvia tested hot.

3622
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:55,680
Like look at what he looked like when he
fought rico rodriguez.

3623
02:31:56,010 --> 02:32:01,010
I think that tim silvia that beat rico 
rodriguez is one of the scariest 

3624
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:01,170
heavYweights ever.

3625
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,230
I agree.
Tim silvia takedown defense,

3626
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:06,430
great strategies to righthand monster.
They just,

3627
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:11,480
you know,
he couldn't keep that fucking hanging 

3628
02:32:11,480 --> 02:32:15,060
off the side and I think he was getting 
criticized for it and I feel like that's

3629
02:32:15,061 --> 02:32:17,130
why I did steroid.
I think you're right.

3630
02:32:17,220 --> 02:32:18,090
I think you're right.
I mean,

3631
02:32:18,091 --> 02:32:19,930
he,
he'd always wanted to sell it to me.

3632
02:32:20,170 --> 02:32:25,170
he wanted to look the part,
a little embarrassed of his body a 

3633
02:32:25,170 --> 02:32:26,130
little bit,
but I also think that it benefited him.

3634
02:32:26,190 --> 02:32:30,150
It benefited him physically the way he 
would pull up a pull up.

3635
02:32:30,151 --> 02:32:35,151
Tim silvia versus rico rodriguez.
That's tim when he was retired from the 

3636
02:32:36,181 --> 02:32:38,730
ufc.
Now that's tim versus rico rodriguez.

3637
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:40,590
you see that?
That image.

3638
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:44,460
Look how fucking leni wasn't big.
He was dangerous motherfucker and he was

3639
02:32:44,461 --> 02:32:46,890
eating rico's leg kicks and dropping 
right hands on.

3640
02:32:47,250 --> 02:32:49,080
Plus the video.
If you could find the video.

3641
02:32:49,350 --> 02:32:51,090
He.
He was a scary guy because he.

3642
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:56,120
Oh,
he also struggled to get down to two 65 

3643
02:32:56,120 --> 02:32:56,730
for that fight.
He was drawing to get down to,

3644
02:32:56,731 --> 02:32:58,760
to see ms dot wait.
He missed wait the first time.

3645
02:32:58,810 --> 02:33:01,380
Walked around that I don't know him,
but he was big.

3646
02:33:01,381 --> 02:33:03,680
So john saying,
not religious big,

3647
02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:06,210
not fat,
but big shoulders and neck.

3648
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:07,380
Such a monster.
Yeah,

3649
02:33:08,210 --> 02:33:11,130
exactly.
Clover is on stuff.

3650
02:33:11,190 --> 02:33:15,810
Part of glover to share as mystique is 
his amazing physical strength and I just

3651
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:20,811
questioned it.
I have no reason to think he's on 

3652
02:33:20,811 --> 02:33:23,301
steroids,
but I do wonder how someone can be so 

3653
02:33:23,301 --> 02:33:23,301
strong.
He says,

3654
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:27,030
I'm sure I have fought guys in the past 
that were on steroids.

3655
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:32,031
I Think it's pretty well documented.
a lot of people haven't really argued 

3656
02:33:32,031 --> 02:33:33,780
with it because they know it's true 
statement.

3657
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:35,100
I know it's a true statement.

3658
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:40,100
I called dana white and said,
I want glover to take steroid tests for 

3659
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:40,290
this fight.
He asked me,

3660
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:42,000
what do you think?
He's on steroids,

3661
02:33:42,060 --> 02:33:43,830
and I told him,
I don't know.

3662
02:33:43,831 --> 02:33:46,140
I have no reason to accuse him of 
anything,

3663
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:50,100
but I would like to be sure.
How can you be mad at that?

3664
02:33:50,190 --> 02:33:53,880
You can't be mad at that.
I'm not mad at that at all,

3665
02:33:53,980 --> 02:33:55,260
and if he came out and was like,
hey,

3666
02:33:55,261 --> 02:33:56,730
glover's on stuff,
there's,

3667
02:33:57,220 --> 02:33:57,990
there's tim,
sylvia,

3668
02:33:57,991 --> 02:34:00,960
when he fought rico.
Wow.

3669
02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:05,990
Look at that big motherfucker to rico.
Had a good guard to man are legitimate 

3670
02:34:06,061 --> 02:34:09,720
shadow black belt for sure.
Tim silvia was scary back then,

3671
02:34:09,721 --> 02:34:12,510
man.
Super scary and he knocked a lot of guys

3672
02:34:12,511 --> 02:34:12,870
out.
Man.

3673
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:18,040
A lot of people sleep on tim silvia.
He never gets brought up because he had 

3674
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:18,040
sort of a dispute with ufc,
but

3675
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:23,040
head kick,
trade telemann knocked him out and tim 

3676
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:23,170
silvia was not a natural athlete by the 
way.

3677
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:26,590
This is all from toughness in training 
mean pigeon toed.

3678
02:34:26,591 --> 02:34:31,591
In fact,
his feet like naturally went towards 

3679
02:34:31,591 --> 02:34:31,750
each other and here he stuffs to take 
down again,

3680
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:36,310
rough sum up on the ground and tim 
silvia back then,

3681
02:34:36,520 --> 02:34:37,210
you know,
I mean,

3682
02:34:37,211 --> 02:34:42,211
you're dealing with a guy who really.
And this is good fucking high guard has 

3683
02:34:42,211 --> 02:34:42,400
to gun.
Yeah.

3684
02:34:42,401 --> 02:34:45,280
And it's like I said,
legit brazilian jiu jitsu,

3685
02:34:45,281 --> 02:34:46,690
black belt,
very high level.

3686
02:34:47,230 --> 02:34:49,180
Especially at the time,
you know,

3687
02:34:49,181 --> 02:34:54,181
at the time,
rico was one of very few brazilian 

3688
02:34:54,181 --> 02:34:54,430
jujitsu,
black belts in the heavyweight division.

3689
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:59,640
There wasn't a lot of guys.
You see them sitting noguera's guard 

3690
02:34:59,640 --> 02:34:59,640
risk control.
Yup.

3691
02:34:59,640 --> 02:34:59,860
Yeah,
yeah.

3692
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:00,940
He,
uh,

3693
02:35:00,970 --> 02:35:04,360
tim silvia at this time I think was one 
of the scariest guys.

3694
02:35:04,361 --> 02:35:05,920
I agree with you,
but what,

3695
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:10,940
you know,
who knows how much of it was hard 

3696
02:35:10,940 --> 02:35:11,830
training first of all,
for sure it was definitely some steroids

3697
02:35:11,831 --> 02:35:12,370
and fall to me.

3698
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:13,420
He took a look at that,
look at that,

3699
02:35:13,450 --> 02:35:15,580
whipped over for that arm bar.
That was pretty fucking sweet.

3700
02:35:15,581 --> 02:35:19,210
Have that was pretty fucking sweet.
Spike some gets out of it.

3701
02:35:19,230 --> 02:35:21,630
That was a god damn sweet.
Armbar rico had a nest.

3702
02:35:21,631 --> 02:35:23,020
The arm bar.
I'Ll tell you what.

3703
02:35:23,140 --> 02:35:26,110
Rico had a nice little appearance on a 
slow rehab too.

3704
02:35:26,111 --> 02:35:27,130
I watched it.
All of it.

3705
02:35:27,160 --> 02:35:28,300
Oh no.
With dr.

3706
02:35:28,410 --> 02:35:30,280
Drew,
what was he doing?

3707
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:33,310
Drugs.
He likes a little booger.

3708
02:35:33,311 --> 02:35:38,311
Sugar.
He likes to have a good time and 

3709
02:35:38,311 --> 02:35:38,311
partying.
Yeah.

3710
02:35:38,311 --> 02:35:38,530
Well,
you know what he likes.

3711
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:42,770
He likes to have a good time.
That tim sylvia rodriguez.

3712
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:44,410
I'm not mad.
Was a fun guy man.

3713
02:35:44,411 --> 02:35:48,280
He's a fun guy to hang around with and 
there's the righthand he starts.

3714
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:50,800
He's keeping the fight standing.
I'll tell you what,

3715
02:35:50,801 --> 02:35:53,620
my only experience with rico,
only time I ever met him,

3716
02:35:53,650 --> 02:35:55,300
he was calling in tito ortiz.

3717
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:57,330
We're on the same card.
And uh,

3718
02:35:58,270 --> 02:36:00,640
he's looking at the,
at the corner and he goes,

3719
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:02,740
who in the health?
Schwab.

3720
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:04,660
Schwab bank,
gonzaga.

3721
02:36:04,840 --> 02:36:06,760
I go right behind you man.
He goes,

3722
02:36:06,840 --> 02:36:07,620
your shower?
Yeah.

3723
02:36:07,630 --> 02:36:09,670
He goes,
good luck man.

3724
02:36:09,700 --> 02:36:11,740
And walks away and I was all,
wow,

3725
02:36:11,800 --> 02:36:13,170
thanks man.
Went in there.

3726
02:36:13,171 --> 02:36:15,610
I beat the brakes off gonzaga for three 
rounds,

3727
02:36:15,611 --> 02:36:17,680
striking clinic.
Walked back and he's like,

3728
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,000
damn,
great job,

3729
02:36:19,001 --> 02:36:19,690
man.
He gave me a hug,

3730
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:27,060
let addict to say that's a fucking 
mindfuck former ufc heavyweight 

3731
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:27,610
champion.
And I was a fan.

3732
02:36:27,611 --> 02:36:28,400
I was like,
oh,

3733
02:36:28,401 --> 02:36:29,720
thanks bro.
Who said?

3734
02:36:30,930 --> 02:36:33,430
Oh yeah,
that's hilarious.

3735
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:35,480
That's hilarious.
That's really funny.

3736
02:36:35,850 --> 02:36:36,280
Funny,
right?

3737
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:41,540
It made me feel like shit.
It's a fucking bad time to feel like 

3738
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:41,920
shit.
Did you see this thing?

3739
02:36:41,921 --> 02:36:44,680
And tim kennedy fucking tim kennedy,
uh,

3740
02:36:44,681 --> 02:36:47,020
at the press conference.
Bisping was swearing at him,

3741
02:36:47,021 --> 02:36:47,570
fuck you.

3742
02:36:47,570 --> 02:36:48,730
You fuck you.
Fuck this.

3743
02:36:49,190 --> 02:36:54,190
We're talking about this.
Bisping legitimately gently makes a 

3744
02:36:54,190 --> 02:36:54,190
reason to hate you to get ready for the 
fight.

3745
02:36:54,310 --> 02:36:55,030
Yeah.
Look at this.

3746
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:57,490
Meanwhile,
you know,

3747
02:36:57,550 --> 02:37:02,550
who do you have in that fight?
He's trying to scare tim kennedy who's 

3748
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:02,550
been to war.
I mean,

3749
02:37:05,040 --> 02:37:07,820
brennan man.
He's killed a lot of bad guys.

3750
02:37:07,821 --> 02:37:12,821
Like the difference between the fear 
that he's experienced and the fear of 

3751
02:37:12,821 --> 02:37:13,090
like a fight and the preparation for 
fight.

3752
02:37:13,091 --> 02:37:16,550
This is like a vacation for him.
It really is a rough,

3753
02:37:16,570 --> 02:37:20,240
is his mental toughness is not messing.
Listen,

3754
02:37:20,270 --> 02:37:25,270
he as as tough as a human being that 
gracie had his back,

3755
02:37:25,551 --> 02:37:27,870
that was cool,
like was chill on the pitch,

3756
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:31,250
did not care.
Double risk and a lot of combat.

3757
02:37:31,251 --> 02:37:36,251
It's a different world man.
That world of firefights in firefights 

3758
02:37:36,251 --> 02:37:37,760
killed bad guys.
You know,

3759
02:37:37,761 --> 02:37:38,840
that's his thing.

3760
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:41,720
Fighting [inaudible] probably not that 
much for life and death.

3761
02:37:42,500 --> 02:37:47,500
Life and death.
I mean there's some of the stories that 

3762
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:48,020
he tells about his firefights and the 
things that he can't remember.

3763
02:37:48,021 --> 02:37:50,170
How many firefights he's been with that.
Yeah.

3764
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:53,000
And then who do you have in that fight?
A good fight.

3765
02:37:53,240 --> 02:37:56,690
A good fight.
Michael bisping has a fucking tremendous

3766
02:37:56,691 --> 02:38:01,691
pace that he can keep.
Michael bisping has a fucking 34 hearts 

3767
02:38:01,691 --> 02:38:04,541
beat per minute.
Resting heart rate that's got some 

3768
02:38:04,541 --> 02:38:04,541
credits like the shame he is fit as 
fuck.

3769
02:38:04,541 --> 02:38:08,720
It's the opposite came because cain is a
freak of nature,

3770
02:38:08,721 --> 02:38:13,721
man.
He really is a freak of nature when it 

3771
02:38:13,721 --> 02:38:13,721
comes to his cardio.
You talked to bob cook,

3772
02:38:13,721 --> 02:38:14,000
he says it came will take like a month 
off.

3773
02:38:14,001 --> 02:38:15,530
Get injured.
Come back in,

3774
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:17,360
outwork everybody,
like it doesn't make any sense,

3775
02:38:17,370 --> 02:38:22,370
like he doesn't have these like breaking
periods where he has to get back in 

3776
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:22,590
shape and some of that is just genetic 
slips,

3777
02:38:22,650 --> 02:38:25,400
just like some people have incredible 
fast twitch muscle fiber.

3778
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:27,350
We've met guys that have never lifted 
weights in there.

3779
02:38:27,351 --> 02:38:30,690
Fucking gigantic pick cafs and shit like
that doesn't even a.

3780
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:33,950
But look at cane I w I wouldn't say 
canes really explosive.

3781
02:38:33,951 --> 02:38:38,951
He kinda has that softer body.
Whereas the insurance is going to be 

3782
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:38,951
higher.
It's 100 percent genetics.

3783
02:38:38,951 --> 02:38:41,150
Yeah.
Well he definitely doesn't have the same

3784
02:38:41,151 --> 02:38:43,300
kind of.
You guys like hector lumbar,

3785
02:38:43,330 --> 02:38:45,740
right?
Who's just jack to the gills.

3786
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:47,800
His ears have fricking traps.
You know,

3787
02:38:47,801 --> 02:38:50,840
you just like swole.
All explosiveness.

3788
02:38:51,080 --> 02:38:53,030
Nolan's more explosive than hector.
I agree.

3789
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:56,510
He's the most explosive guy that's ever 
fought in mma right up there with melvin

3790
02:38:56,560 --> 02:39:01,560
manhoef.
I think he's even more exposed to the 

3791
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:01,560
melbourne.
I think so too,

3792
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:01,910
because of the judo and they said,
hector,

3793
02:39:01,940 --> 02:39:06,770
your giant swole muscles.
Let's give you the vegan jake shields.

3794
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:10,860
Let's see how this goes.
Fight and fight.

3795
02:39:10,990 --> 02:39:13,430
Well,
jagan steroids on its neck.

3796
02:39:13,480 --> 02:39:17,330
Jake caught his neck with the last 
remaining second fight was hanging on.

3797
02:39:17,331 --> 02:39:21,230
Jake's got a god damn vice for a grip.
When he gets that good team,

3798
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:26,231
man,
he tightened that shit up on robbie 

3799
02:39:26,231 --> 02:39:27,641
lawler.
He tightens that shit up on everybody 

3800
02:39:27,641 --> 02:39:27,641
and you don't think he's going to be 
able to get it.

3801
02:39:27,641 --> 02:39:28,660
Like there's a lot of guys think they 
can get out of that.

3802
02:39:28,670 --> 02:39:29,820
Yeah.
Jake jacobs strong.

3803
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:32,300
Going to train with them on friday and 
san francisco.

3804
02:39:32,610 --> 02:39:37,610
I'm hector lombard.
Motherfucker hit some judo throws in 

3805
02:39:37,610 --> 02:39:41,470
this light against jake shields that you
just like a ragdoll them.

3806
02:39:41,480 --> 02:39:43,280
If ever there's a reason why.
Hey dad,

3807
02:39:43,281 --> 02:39:45,020
why can't I look at this?
Boom,

3808
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:50,200
why watch that again,
just back that up again and just back 

3809
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:53,991
that up to that judo toss to back it up 
all the way to do this in a world class 

3810
02:39:54,291 --> 02:39:57,800
grappler like jake shields is just 
insane.

3811
02:39:57,830 --> 02:40:01,550
Watch this.
He does it so beautifully.

3812
02:40:01,551 --> 02:40:06,551
Perfect technique and speed and he's one
of those storms of like athleticism and 

3813
02:40:07,821 --> 02:40:12,821
technique and really started striking 
once he was already an olympic judo.

3814
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:19,320
That's when he started striking,
so he prefers to keep fight standing 

3815
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:21,580
just because he's such a fucking 
specimen.

3816
02:40:21,610 --> 02:40:22,560
Oh,
you won't be a vegan.

3817
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:24,030
I'm going,
I'm going to play that tape for you,

3818
02:40:24,240 --> 02:40:26,250
but be here.
Watch this fight.

3819
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:31,360
Like in all fairness,
when you talk about a style like jake 

3820
02:40:31,360 --> 02:40:31,360
shields is kinda like what we were 
talking about could be a worse match up.

3821
02:40:31,630 --> 02:40:33,180
Yeah.
They were trying to get rid of them.

3822
02:40:33,270 --> 02:40:38,270
Well I don't think so.
They were just trying to give him a 

3823
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:38,270
fight that was going to be a really 
tough fight.

3824
02:40:38,270 --> 02:40:38,850
I mean look,
they just,

3825
02:40:38,940 --> 02:40:41,400
it's like if you want to be in the top 
10 and he wanted a title shot,

3826
02:40:41,401 --> 02:40:44,400
like if he beat book,
what if he caught him with that team the

3827
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:46,380
first round and finished it.
You know,

3828
02:40:46,530 --> 02:40:49,020
he's likely in the short list for a 
title shot.

3829
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:52,570
If he could finish a guy basically five,
that'd be $500.

3830
02:40:52,571 --> 02:40:56,670
You see a guy like hector lumbar,
that style of fucking sprinting.

3831
02:40:56,790 --> 02:41:00,860
You can't do it for three rounds.
Can do it for five rounds.

3832
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:03,260
Fight tyron woodley,
woodley.

3833
02:41:03,880 --> 02:41:08,880
He's fighting rory.
Rory mcdonald versus willie's a 

3834
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:12,321
fantastic fight,
especially if the rory that beat damien 

3835
02:41:12,321 --> 02:41:14,340
maia shows up.
If rory is motivated and aggressive,

3836
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:16,470
he's gotta.
Get the fuck away from woodland.

3837
02:41:16,471 --> 02:41:19,530
That first round though,
buddy and woodley.

3838
02:41:19,531 --> 02:41:20,160
It's,
you know,

3839
02:41:20,250 --> 02:41:24,420
woodley can move as fast as any fucking 
human being in the ufc.

3840
02:41:24,421 --> 02:41:27,180
I don't care if the 135 pounds at one 
70,

3841
02:41:27,181 --> 02:41:29,460
that fucking dude can move like a fast 
one.

3842
02:41:29,461 --> 02:41:31,200
30 five is that,
that explosive.

3843
02:41:31,201 --> 02:41:36,201
He's as big as you can ever get and be a
world class hundred and 70 pounder.

3844
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:38,760
And it's an interesting situation 
because,

3845
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:39,970
you know,
there's,

3846
02:41:40,030 --> 02:41:41,290
there's a lot of like,
uh,

3847
02:41:41,310 --> 02:41:43,650
there was debate after I talked about it
on the,

3848
02:41:43,651 --> 02:41:46,440
uh,
on the broadcast about this body type.

3849
02:41:46,650 --> 02:41:49,380
It has its benefits for sure as far as 
explosion and speed,

3850
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:53,520
but it also has a lot of requirements 
like for oxygen.

3851
02:41:53,521 --> 02:41:54,360
Yeah.
And it's like,

3852
02:41:54,361 --> 02:41:59,361
can a guy take it deep into the rounds?
What happens if a guy survives fourth 

3853
02:41:59,361 --> 02:42:00,630
and fifth?
Because when nate beat them,

3854
02:42:00,631 --> 02:42:05,631
they beat him in the fourth round.
Marquardt stopped him in strikeforce 

3855
02:42:05,631 --> 02:42:09,170
welterweight title fight.
And that's what happened is nate caught 

3856
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:12,440
him slowing down and nate,
nate then was before he's had a couple 

3857
02:42:12,440 --> 02:42:14,610
of these bad knockouts,
like the knockout against hector,

3858
02:42:14,611 --> 02:42:19,611
lumbar toughest to get knocked out.
He was when he fought tyron woodley.

3859
02:42:19,681 --> 02:42:24,681
You're talking about nate marquardt who 
was at his best and but it's back 

3860
02:42:24,681 --> 02:42:25,130
against the wall too because he had been
kicked out of the ufc,

3861
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:30,650
finally gets back into strikeforce and 
he gets a shot at the title at 

3862
02:42:30,650 --> 02:42:31,230
strikeforce.
It's a big fight and you know,

3863
02:42:31,231 --> 02:42:32,370
nate was primed.

3864
02:42:32,400 --> 02:42:33,810
It was in his prime.
But you know,

3865
02:42:33,811 --> 02:42:38,811
look,
a guy like tyron woodley who is a 

3866
02:42:38,811 --> 02:42:38,811
superior athlete,
he's just an elite athlete,

3867
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:42,600
is still learning the mma skills.
But it's like what we were talking about

3868
02:42:42,601 --> 02:42:47,190
before is that what you're seeing now is
guys who are on an athletic level,

3869
02:42:47,250 --> 02:42:51,270
like you've never had the ufc before,
but go back to ufc one and you know,

3870
02:42:51,271 --> 02:42:53,100
you watched like,
you know,

3871
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:56,310
some of these guys who as decent 
athletes,

3872
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:57,510
good athletes,
you know,

3873
02:42:57,511 --> 02:43:01,260
tough guys and had incredible balls to 
get into the ufc at that time.

3874
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:04,410
Put tyron woodley and ufc one crazy,
crazy,

3875
02:43:04,650 --> 02:43:09,650
crazy.
Ain't taking that dude down now there's 

3876
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:09,650
no,
that's not happening at the top.

3877
02:43:09,650 --> 02:43:09,960
There's nothing happening.
Evolution of the sport.

3878
02:43:09,990 --> 02:43:12,250
Yeah.
I mean if you watch when tyron woodley

3879
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:17,250
beat like jay hiran know one existed 
that could move that fast until 

3880
02:43:17,250 --> 02:43:21,571
recently.
No one existed in the ufc like within 

3881
02:43:21,571 --> 02:43:21,571
the last five,
six years.

3882
02:43:21,571 --> 02:43:25,381
You're starting to see these guys 
trickle in that have that kind of 

3883
02:43:25,381 --> 02:43:25,480
explosion of that kind of athleticism,
that kind of speed.

3884
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:27,460
And hector is right up there.
Heck,

3885
02:43:27,490 --> 02:43:32,490
it's like hector entirely.
So it's like as someone who analyzes 

3886
02:43:32,490 --> 02:43:34,630
fights and it analyzes like there's a 
point of diminishing returns,

3887
02:43:34,631 --> 02:43:39,631
like what's the best body type?
Is it super muscular like hector 

3888
02:43:39,631 --> 02:43:41,050
lombard?
Or is it like a carlos condit guy that's

3889
02:43:41,051 --> 02:43:43,960
super durable and king last round after 
round,

3890
02:43:44,210 --> 02:43:45,220
you know,
and the woodley fight,

3891
02:43:45,221 --> 02:43:48,430
we saw woodley one me,
he fucked up tyrons knee.

3892
02:43:48,431 --> 02:43:49,480
It's a.
But look,

3893
02:43:49,630 --> 02:43:51,640
it wasn't really a fight.
His leg fell off,

3894
02:43:51,670 --> 02:43:56,670
his leg got hurt in the take down and 
then he heard it again when he led 

3895
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:56,670
kitchen.

3896
02:43:56,670 --> 02:43:59,170
It's not the same as him beating him,
like with no injuries,

3897
02:43:59,171 --> 02:44:02,280
but the bottom line is he wins.
He wins j.

3898
02:44:02,310 --> 02:44:03,070
You know what I mean?
You can't,

3899
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:04,720
you can't really.
You know what I mean?

3900
02:44:04,721 --> 02:44:08,410
Like you can't quantify it the same way 
as a knockout or submission.

3901
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:11,230
It's similar to cane versus brock 
lesnar.

3902
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:14,450
One guy's just swole to the gills.
The other guy,

3903
02:44:14,620 --> 02:44:16,060
if you,
if you saw him with his shirt off,

3904
02:44:16,061 --> 02:44:21,061
you're like,
there's no way you're the best except 

3905
02:44:21,061 --> 02:44:21,061
the fact that,
you know,

3906
02:44:21,061 --> 02:44:21,370
would they was still there in the second
round,

3907
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:23,260
you know,
and he's still going at it in the second

3908
02:44:23,261 --> 02:44:23,800
round,
you know?

3909
02:44:23,801 --> 02:44:24,340
And that's,
you're right,

3910
02:44:24,341 --> 02:44:29,341
you're right about that.
There's gotta be a balance like too 

3911
02:44:29,341 --> 02:44:29,790
muscular has its liabilities and there's
a.

3912
02:44:29,890 --> 02:44:34,890
It's like they had that debate about 
what's the perfect way for the 

3913
02:44:34,890 --> 02:44:34,890
heavyweight boxer?

3914
02:44:34,890 --> 02:44:36,370
When you get to a certain weight,
you start losing speed and power.

3915
02:44:37,050 --> 02:44:38,770
So is it 2:30,
2:40

3916
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:40,240
2:35?
It depends on the body.

3917
02:44:40,270 --> 02:44:42,030
You know,
I think bo jackson tell you what number.

3918
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:44,270
Bo jackson at 2:45.
That freaky ashlyn.

3919
02:44:44,670 --> 02:44:49,480
He would have,
he would have been probably the,

3920
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,360
that's probably the optimal,
the optimal.

3921
02:44:52,361 --> 02:44:53,870
And you know what he does now?
Bow hunts.

3922
02:44:54,240 --> 02:44:54,900
Yeah,
he does.

3923
02:44:54,910 --> 02:44:57,040
That's his shit.
Talked to him about hunting for.

3924
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,810
Oh,
I don't know.

3925
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:02,710
About two hours.
Did you live in jackson?

3926
02:45:02,711 --> 02:45:07,711
That's what you talked about.
Hunting and he talks about he wants to 

3927
02:45:07,711 --> 02:45:07,711
talk about.
That's what,

3928
02:45:07,711 --> 02:45:08,790
uh,
that's what he wants to talk about.

3929
02:45:09,060 --> 02:45:12,160
Like he's obsessed with the way we 
talked about football and baseball too.

3930
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:15,780
You better auburn football.
Been winning.

3931
02:45:15,790 --> 02:45:16,900
And I said about football.
He said,

3932
02:45:16,901 --> 02:45:17,710
he said,
he said,

3933
02:45:17,860 --> 02:45:18,480
well,
I never left the.

3934
02:45:18,510 --> 02:45:19,150
And I played football.

3935
02:45:19,150 --> 02:45:20,890
He was six.
He was about six to 2:45

3936
02:45:20,920 --> 02:45:21,670
then.
And,

3937
02:45:21,671 --> 02:45:22,660
and,
and I said,

3938
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:24,450
why?
He goes,

3939
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:29,610
he goes,
I just scrapped it all and I just go in 

3940
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:29,610
there and I'd hear them whispering,
posted the game post in the game.

3941
02:45:29,610 --> 02:45:30,840
He was just run through to.
He said,

3942
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:32,620
baseball is way harder than he thought 
it was.

3943
02:45:32,621 --> 02:45:35,710
As he thought of it as a very,
very cerebral game.

3944
02:45:35,711 --> 02:45:37,440
Way more.
So here's bowhunting.

3945
02:45:37,620 --> 02:45:42,620
Here's bono's hunting in a tree myself.
Not only enjoys hunting big bucks,

3946
02:45:46,130 --> 02:45:48,310
but he loves to shoot a few arrows in 
between.

3947
02:45:48,640 --> 02:45:53,640
Shoot a few arrows.
How bad are these narrators and these 

3948
02:45:53,640 --> 02:45:55,000
fucking hunting shows?
Can we get better production?

3949
02:45:55,030 --> 02:45:56,320
No,
no.

3950
02:45:56,380 --> 02:46:01,380
They get a dollar an episode put 
together which you to pay for your 

3951
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:02,050
flight on southwest.
You get out there.

3952
02:46:02,051 --> 02:46:03,820
The film.
This shit with fucking handycams.

3953
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:07,390
Oh my god.
Fast forward to this so we don't have to

3954
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:12,391
hear it.
Just get to the part where both shoots 

3955
02:46:12,391 --> 02:46:12,391
it.
Here it is.

3956
02:46:12,391 --> 02:46:15,360
Wonder if he can pull back on that pump 
after she doesn't feel it.

3957
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:18,700
He's moving nice and slow.
Straight up.

3958
02:46:18,701 --> 02:46:19,480
Killer.
Look at boats.

3959
02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:20,980
yeah,
that's a light bulb because he's pulling

3960
02:46:20,981 --> 02:46:23,110
it back at night.
There's about an inch high.

3961
02:46:24,050 --> 02:46:24,410
Oh,
he's in.

3962
02:46:24,490 --> 02:46:29,490
Isn't a tree.
Boom.

3963
02:46:30,190 --> 02:46:31,720
Yeah.
Hey,

3964
02:46:31,721 --> 02:46:34,270
I got an idea.
Next time you bring bo jackson up,

3965
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:37,630
let's show some highlights of him 
destroying guys on the football field.

3966
02:46:38,150 --> 02:46:39,520
Killing.
That's what he likes.

3967
02:46:39,521 --> 02:46:44,521
Now he likes doing that and I'm like bow
jackson anymore because both jackson bow

3968
02:46:45,821 --> 02:46:47,420
hunts,
you know jackson,

3969
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:49,660
super boring.
You know what I find is fascinating.

3970
02:46:49,740 --> 02:46:51,400
Herschel.
mother fucking walker,

3971
02:46:51,401 --> 02:46:56,401
almost 50 years.
Jack his last fight when he was like 49.

3972
02:46:58,630 --> 02:47:00,370
It's st by the way.
Take a look at his body,

3973
02:47:00,850 --> 02:47:04,150
man against the broncos doing work 
shredded.

3974
02:47:04,360 --> 02:47:05,540
You don't want to see him sitting in a 
tree.

3975
02:47:05,541 --> 02:47:08,230
He's a super athlete shooting,
shooting a deer with walkers.

3976
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:10,510
Ridiculous.
He started when he was young.

3977
02:47:10,930 --> 02:47:12,970
We'd all,
we'd all be no shit.

3978
02:47:12,971 --> 02:47:14,740
Right?
He'd rip people's faces of.

3979
02:47:14,890 --> 02:47:19,890
Is that hershel walker?
It's incredible that he had mma fights 

3980
02:47:19,890 --> 02:47:19,890
in strikeforce.
Deep into.

3981
02:47:19,890 --> 02:47:24,271
It's so crazY.
Give you pull up at herschel walker mma 

3982
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:24,271
fight.
Get crazy.

3983
02:47:24,271 --> 02:47:24,440
Look at that.
Look at that.

3984
02:47:25,270 --> 02:47:28,360
Let's thanking god.
He know he's shredded,

3985
02:47:28,361 --> 02:47:33,220
but he's fighting billy billy from 
kinko's who best to the arena and tossed

3986
02:47:33,221 --> 02:47:37,540
on the mouthpiece and whooped his ass.
He was fighting notch guys.

3987
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:39,370
Fight.
Chad griggs.

3988
02:47:40,140 --> 02:47:41,670
Who did.
Who did herschel walker fight

3989
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:44,140
you?
I mean,

3990
02:47:44,530 --> 02:47:46,150
what are you saying?
Chad?

3991
02:47:46,151 --> 02:47:48,460
Greeks is world class,
but I know that's what I'm saying.

3992
02:47:48,461 --> 02:47:49,930
He's a very good fighter.
The jet fighter.

3993
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:52,900
Chet griggs is legit.
Don't you?

3994
02:47:52,901 --> 02:47:54,070
Shit on him.
You son of a bitch.

3995
02:47:54,100 --> 02:47:56,350
I'm not shitting on anybody who's he 
fighting here?

3996
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:58,810
Some pretty good guard,
man.

3997
02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:05,430
Oh yeah.
That was the dam.

3998
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:09,730
He was big.

3999
02:48:10,210 --> 02:48:13,560
Forty eight years old here.
Just completely shredded.

4000
02:48:13,570 --> 02:48:16,630
It's just there's a difference in 
athleticism,

4001
02:48:16,631 --> 02:48:18,010
man.
When you get to this level,

4002
02:48:18,370 --> 02:48:22,460
when you get to like a herschel walker,
you're dealing in a hundred first.

4003
02:48:22,560 --> 02:48:26,680
All I talked about this in jujitsu,
there's black belts and then there's the

4004
02:48:26,681 --> 02:48:31,681
one percent black belts who like booze 
shesha haji and yes,

4005
02:48:31,960 --> 02:48:35,770
those guys.
So he was to make it to the nfl.

4006
02:48:35,771 --> 02:48:37,660
You're the one percent of all football 
players.

4007
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,880
He was the one percent of one 
percenters.

4008
02:48:40,210 --> 02:48:41,920
Nfl.
That's insane.

4009
02:48:41,921 --> 02:48:44,030
Insane.
And one percent of one percent or one at

4010
02:48:44,060 --> 02:48:46,000
a time.
And right now all we watch them on,

4011
02:48:46,001 --> 02:48:51,001
strikeforce beat up some poor white guy 
who has no business being in the scarf 

4012
02:48:51,001 --> 02:48:54,830
cars.
Scott carson and greg nagy are the guys 

4013
02:48:54,830 --> 02:48:55,340
that he fought and he never.
He never followed Chad.

4014
02:48:55,360 --> 02:48:56,400
Greg.
So my apologies.

4015
02:48:57,040 --> 02:48:58,540
Can you calm down and you over there?

4016
02:48:59,670 --> 02:49:03,040
I'll take brian or you didn't.
You didn't.

4017
02:49:03,041 --> 02:49:06,220
You fight like some guys that maybe 
didn't have the base 52.

4018
02:49:06,470 --> 02:49:07,370
Yeah.
No,

4019
02:49:07,410 --> 02:49:09,170
he is a monster.
Don't get me wrong.

4020
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:10,650
Still looks great.
Yes.

4021
02:49:11,090 --> 02:49:14,410
I would take his bottles of wine,
tea,

4022
02:49:14,440 --> 02:49:15,570
our tea.
It doesn't take that.

4023
02:49:15,610 --> 02:49:20,610
You sure?
He also says he's surprised also says 

4024
02:49:20,610 --> 02:49:22,170
that he only eats a bowl of soup and a 
salad at dinner as well.

4025
02:49:22,171 --> 02:49:23,910
But he eats other stuff.
Oh no.

4026
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:26,550
Somebody says exercise is always been a 
religion to him.

4027
02:49:26,551 --> 02:49:26,720
Like,
well,

4028
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:28,560
you know,
he also had like a,

4029
02:49:28,620 --> 02:49:33,090
an issue or trauma related issue with 
like multiple personality disorder.

4030
02:49:33,390 --> 02:49:34,800
I didn't.
Yeah,

4031
02:49:34,801 --> 02:49:37,410
he had something that was going on.
I heard about this.

4032
02:49:37,411 --> 02:49:42,411
Yeah.
It was going on before he had an mma 

4033
02:49:42,411 --> 02:49:42,411
career and everybody was like,
wait a minute.

4034
02:49:42,411 --> 02:49:44,160
If he's had a trauma related,
um,

4035
02:49:44,190 --> 02:49:47,310
multiple personality disorder here,
I'll pull that up.

4036
02:49:49,120 --> 02:49:49,930
Yeah,
yeah.

4037
02:49:49,931 --> 02:49:51,580
Mercy,
multiple personality disorder.

4038
02:49:51,581 --> 02:49:52,450
Yeah.
He,

4039
02:49:52,451 --> 02:49:53,800
um.
Then they started fighting,

4040
02:49:54,220 --> 02:49:54,660
said,
you know,

4041
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:55,900
I'm bipolar.
This is,

4042
02:49:55,960 --> 02:49:57,510
let's take punches to the face.
Yeah.

4043
02:49:57,520 --> 02:50:02,520
It's cnn Way back in.
When was this article out in 2008.

4044
02:50:03,550 --> 02:50:04,390
He,
uh,

4045
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:09,480
he put out a book about it and it was a 
book about his multiple personalities 

4046
02:50:09,480 --> 02:50:12,070
and they believe that,
I believe it's trauma related.

4047
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:13,570
I should probably google that too.

4048
02:50:14,020 --> 02:50:16,610
Um,
I don't think that,

4049
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:17,480
I mean,

4050
02:50:18,110 --> 02:50:19,820
I'll be honest,
since I've started fighting,

4051
02:50:19,821 --> 02:50:22,120
I'm a little one more serious,
little,

4052
02:50:22,130 --> 02:50:27,130
little quicker trigger for sure.
If something's getting on my nerves I'm 

4053
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:27,130
with on there with them.
I'm,

4054
02:50:27,130 --> 02:50:29,330
I used to be super more laid back,
I'd say.

4055
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:34,600
Okay.
Says usually has its roots in childhood 

4056
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:34,600
trauma.
Okay.

4057
02:50:34,600 --> 02:50:38,411
So that might not mean head injury.
It might mean like abuse child cope with

4058
02:50:39,231 --> 02:50:41,290
trauma or abuse.
hm.

4059
02:50:41,930 --> 02:50:42,620
I don't know.

4060
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:48,380
And also it has to do with ptsd,
ptsd.

4061
02:50:48,500 --> 02:50:50,760
So I guess it is talking about abuse,
about um,

4062
02:50:51,100 --> 02:50:52,120
not,
not physical,

4063
02:50:52,130 --> 02:50:52,940
not like,
hey,

4064
02:50:52,941 --> 02:50:54,230
I'm being treated,
but I mean,

4065
02:50:54,231 --> 02:50:59,231
just think about the amount of head 
trauma that you have to get playing 

4066
02:50:59,231 --> 02:50:59,231
football at a high level.
It's unavoidable.

4067
02:50:59,231 --> 02:51:00,680
There's no right,
you did it.

4068
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:02,180
It's unavoidable,
unavoidable.

4069
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:03,890
It's really,
it's practice.

4070
02:51:04,160 --> 02:51:09,160
It's the practice that does it.
How many times do you think you got 

4071
02:51:09,160 --> 02:51:09,160
concussions while playing football?

4072
02:51:09,590 --> 02:51:11,300
Oh,
five or six and not that many.

4073
02:51:11,301 --> 02:51:16,301
I was smart about it.
You're aware of this kind of crazy at 

4074
02:51:16,301 --> 02:51:19,720
five or six.
This is like a low end for and I played 

4075
02:51:19,720 --> 02:51:22,530
fullback h back where your.
See if you guys know the position,

4076
02:51:22,910 --> 02:51:25,780
you're constantly running five.
It's ridiculous now.

4077
02:51:25,781 --> 02:51:29,000
I think about five yards apart.
You run as fast as you can into that.

4078
02:51:29,001 --> 02:51:31,340
Go with your head first.
That's what I was doing nonstop.

4079
02:51:31,610 --> 02:51:33,560
She christ.
That's crazy.

4080
02:51:33,770 --> 02:51:35,210
Again,
why wouldn't someone sent me?

4081
02:51:35,211 --> 02:51:36,440
Now I'm like running.
Listen man.

4082
02:51:36,650 --> 02:51:39,110
I don't think it's beneficial for your 
life,

4083
02:51:39,160 --> 02:51:43,150
but you to that guy.
But meanwhile you had success at that.

4084
02:51:43,151 --> 02:51:45,320
That lead you to success in college?
Yeah.

4085
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:45,980
Well,
I said to him,

4086
02:51:45,981 --> 02:51:50,981
I asked him if he would have traded his 
football career and for training and 

4087
02:51:50,981 --> 02:51:53,990
man,
he said no because you could just talk 

4088
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:53,990
now.
Not back then.

4089
02:51:53,990 --> 02:51:54,250
There's just the competition level 
wasn't.

4090
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:58,100
I'm saying it taught you that you've 
learned how to be a dude.

4091
02:51:58,101 --> 02:52:00,230
I was training with killers.
You know,

4092
02:52:00,231 --> 02:52:02,690
you're talking about some of the very 
best athletes in the world day in,

4093
02:52:02,691 --> 02:52:06,730
day out competing.
We're competing on the field competing,

4094
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:11,970
so I just learned mental toughness.
You can't pay for that at the time in 

4095
02:52:12,010 --> 02:52:13,590
2001,
2000.

4096
02:52:13,610 --> 02:52:15,190
There wasn't that in mma.
You know what I'm saying?

4097
02:52:15,191 --> 02:52:16,030
Yeah.
Wow.

4098
02:52:16,870 --> 02:52:21,870
Fun times boys.
This is a fun fucking podcast and three 

4099

That's do it.

that's coming up.

4111
02:52:42,931 --> 02:52:45,680
Let's do it and how floyd mayweather.
We get tapped out by ronda rousey go.

4112
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:48,160
We didn't even talk about that.
We didn't even get into that much time.

4113
02:52:48,161 --> 02:52:49,210
We have left.
How many minutes?

4114
02:52:49,300 --> 02:52:51,100
We can talk about it for a couple.
How much minutes?

4115
02:52:51,101 --> 02:52:52,120
We have left.
Five.

4116
02:52:52,330 --> 02:52:53,410
We have five minutes.
Do this.

4117
02:52:53,650 --> 02:52:55,750
Yeah,
there was a comparison.

4118
02:52:55,780 --> 02:52:57,430
No,
it's not even a fight.

4119
02:52:57,431 --> 02:52:59,620
If you learned how to have takedown 
defense,

4120
02:52:59,800 --> 02:53:01,570
he would have to work on that for a long
time.

4121
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:02,530
But,
um,

4122
02:53:02,770 --> 02:53:05,050
the uh,
the people online are freaking out.

4123
02:53:05,070 --> 02:53:07,480
I was on sports nation today.
Great job.

4124
02:53:07,600 --> 02:53:10,120
They asked me great show max kellerman.
That's fucking awesome.

4125
02:53:10,121 --> 02:53:11,830
I love that guy.
He's such a good.

4126
02:53:12,290 --> 02:53:14,260
The best boxing channel used to be a 
rapper.

4127
02:53:14,670 --> 02:53:15,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

4128
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:16,460
Him and his brother,
right?

4129
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:17,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

4130
02:53:17,711 --> 02:53:20,180
His brother was murdered by a boxer that
they were,

4131
02:53:20,230 --> 02:53:22,600
that he was a roommate with.
Yeah.

4132
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:24,320
It's terrible story.
Yeah.

4133
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:27,790
What do you mean the guy killed them?
Killed them with like a hammer.

4134
02:53:28,490 --> 02:53:30,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

4135
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:33,340
I don't know the full story.
I read it online,

4136
02:53:34,850 --> 02:53:35,340
but,
uh,

4137
02:53:35,430 --> 02:53:38,260
rhonda deStroying floyd mayweather.
that would 100 percent happen.

4138
02:53:38,261 --> 02:53:39,730
It's again,
like we were talking about like,

4139
02:53:39,731 --> 02:53:41,770
I can't play tennis.
I don't know how to play tennis.

4140
02:53:41,771 --> 02:53:43,240
I played tennis with someone who knows 
what they're doing.

4141
02:53:43,241 --> 02:53:48,241
I'm going to get slaughtered.
If you don't know judo and if you don't 

4142
02:53:48,241 --> 02:53:48,241
know how to grapple,
you don't know.

4143
02:53:48,241 --> 02:53:49,330
Take down defense and he will let that 
grow.

4144
02:53:49,331 --> 02:53:51,900
Clench with you.
You're going flying.

4145
02:53:52,150 --> 02:53:56,290
I've seen ronnie get ahold of mma 
professional men,

4146
02:53:56,320 --> 02:53:59,530
215,
220 pounds tosses them.

4147
02:53:59,950 --> 02:54:01,870
These guys have a clue of what they're 
doing.

4148
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:03,970
Little loan.
You know what I'm saying?

4149
02:54:04,240 --> 02:54:06,430
Floyd mayweather,
who has no clue.

4150
02:54:06,431 --> 02:54:07,750
And he's tinY.
Yeah,

4151
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:09,070
he's tiny.
Yeah,

4152
02:54:09,071 --> 02:54:12,880
and she's a 150 lb.
Woman or 145 pound woman.

4153
02:54:13,170 --> 02:54:17,410
Well she was 35 when she fights.
She walks at heavier than 1:42.

4154
02:54:17,411 --> 02:54:20,440
She walks in and she never gets out of 
shape.

4155
02:54:20,470 --> 02:54:22,240
She's just shredded.
She,

4156
02:54:22,750 --> 02:54:23,890
her mom,
her mom's on it,

4157
02:54:23,920 --> 02:54:26,200
you know she.
She's on the keyboard all day.

4158
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:30,040
Reject apps.
Forearm shredded.

4159
02:54:30,070 --> 02:54:33,010
Just mom was a world champion in judo.
Man,

4160
02:54:33,180 --> 02:54:34,950
that's some dna.
That's no joke.

4161
02:54:34,990 --> 02:54:39,990
That's also some dna,
just like we're talking about those 

4162
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:39,990
mice.
That shit gets transferred,

4163
02:54:39,990 --> 02:54:41,530
but it only got transferred to her 
because they're sisters.

4164
02:54:41,531 --> 02:54:46,531
They're successful in their arenas,
but they're not successful like rhonda 

4165
02:54:46,531 --> 02:54:46,531
and combat sports.
Well,

4166
02:54:46,531 --> 02:54:51,180
maybe They have that inside them.
They just chose not to pursue it for 

4167
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:51,180
whatever reason.
Some people,

4168
02:54:51,180 --> 02:54:56,101
they get weird shit where they don't 
want to do what their parents did and 

4169
02:54:56,101 --> 02:54:56,101
they get fucking.
But you know what's weird?

4170
02:54:56,101 --> 02:54:57,290
Like we talked about jeans.
How about arms swartz,

4171
02:54:57,291 --> 02:54:58,030
sneakers,
kids?

4172
02:54:58,870 --> 02:55:00,520
What do they look like?
Shit.

4173
02:55:02,190 --> 02:55:03,130
They're all skinny.

4174
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:09,610
You think a sworn statement?
You think they're gonna?

4175
02:55:09,611 --> 02:55:11,570
Be jack.
Why aren't you doing squats?

4176
02:55:11,571 --> 02:55:13,220
You're not doing anything with your 
glutes.

4177
02:55:13,221 --> 02:55:15,740
Your hamstrings.
Your back is very narrow.

4178
02:55:16,140 --> 02:55:18,910
If you want women to be sexually 
attracted to you,

4179
02:55:19,090 --> 02:55:21,650
you want to come inside them,
deal.

4180
02:55:21,651 --> 02:55:26,651
You can live.
Your body is going to live it strongly 

4181
02:55:26,651 --> 02:55:29,681
to lift weights and you got to run.
You got to do steroids.

4182
02:55:29,900 --> 02:55:31,370
Is that his daughter started,
cutie.

4183
02:55:31,580 --> 02:55:36,580
She's a cutie pie.
Look to try and find the sons that I 

4184
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:39,540
think there are actors.
I'll tell you that on the podcast.

4185
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:42,800
I'll tell you the one who got the girl's
attractive girls.

4186
02:55:42,801 --> 02:55:43,780
Attractive hope.
It's great.

4187
02:55:43,781 --> 02:55:47,270
The one the the,
the kid who had with the made the little

4188
02:55:47,271 --> 02:55:50,480
mexican will do that.
Yeah.

4189
02:55:50,481 --> 02:55:52,100
He got the good gene.
He looks like conan,

4190
02:55:52,820 --> 02:55:56,680
comBination austrian and mexican.
geez,

4191
02:55:58,600 --> 02:55:59,450
what did I say?

4192
02:56:00,380 --> 02:56:02,440
Fuck man.
Anyway,

4193
02:56:03,690 --> 02:56:04,250
hey,
I'm,

4194
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:09,320
I'm,
I'm sure these kids are tapped for the 

4195
02:56:09,320 --> 02:56:11,891
record.
I'm sure the kids separate town shame 

4196
02:56:11,891 --> 02:56:12,320
his fucking son because he's,
I'm sure he's super talented.

4197
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:14,750
I'm just saying he's not gonna win mr 
olympia.

4198
02:56:14,780 --> 02:56:19,780
That's all I'm saying is that maybe 
would have you started lifting and 

4199
02:56:19,780 --> 02:56:20,210
taking steroids a lot of time and 
steroids.

4200
02:56:20,230 --> 02:56:20,900
Yeah.
Nobody's winning.

4201
02:56:20,901 --> 02:56:25,901
Mr m jeans jeans are okay,
but he probably doesn't work out at all 

4202
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:29,210
me.
if he's pretty jacked,

4203
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:34,420
I'll tell you what the little mexican 
guys can be in your next olympian is 

4204
02:56:34,420 --> 02:56:35,000
jack.
He probably doesn't get a chance to hang

4205
02:56:35,001 --> 02:56:40,001
out with his real dad very much either,
and that's probably a bit of a mind 

4206
02:56:40,001 --> 02:56:40,001
fuck.
He's in the weight room.

4207
02:56:40,001 --> 02:56:42,800
Angry doing dead lifts.
You know,

4208
02:56:42,870 --> 02:56:47,870
anger can go along way kettlebell 
whenever he makes those noises,

4209
02:56:52,160 --> 02:56:55,370
that's a good arsenal to lift.

4210
02:56:55,520 --> 02:57:00,520
Pumping is better than calming.
You ever hear that from pumping iron 

4211
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:03,110
pump coming.
I love that movie.

4212
02:57:04,070 --> 02:57:05,630
The fighter and the kid working with 
people.

4213
02:57:05,631 --> 02:57:07,700
Get it.
I tuned soundcloud.

4214
02:57:08,200 --> 02:57:09,320
Yep.
Fox sports.

4215
02:57:09,321 --> 02:57:14,321
One website where we need a website 
because now that we're on fox or are you

4216
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:16,630
bitches living in?
I know now we're living.

4217
02:57:16,640 --> 02:57:17,990
We had.
We do have a website,

4218
02:57:18,200 --> 02:57:23,200
but now that we were on fox sports,
fox sports one for sure to get that 

4219
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:23,920
right.
We.

4220
02:57:23,980 --> 02:57:27,170
We did not itunes find us on itunes,
find the kid,

4221
02:57:27,171 --> 02:57:32,171
fall.
Brian and I asked brendan shop at brian 

4222
02:57:32,171 --> 02:57:35,201
callen.
We post all sorts of videos on 

4223
02:57:35,201 --> 02:57:38,591
instagram.
What's up with them censoring your 

4224
02:57:38,591 --> 02:57:38,591
podcast?
That's wack as fuck.

4225
02:57:38,591 --> 02:57:38,591
You know,
this is the internet.

4226
02:57:38,591 --> 02:57:41,200
I agree.
Box is the big social.

4227
02:57:41,410 --> 02:57:44,780
Look how much fun we had today.
Look how much fun you guys had been buck

4228
02:57:44,781 --> 02:57:48,720
wild fox needs to just put a warning on 
this podcast.

4229
02:57:48,830 --> 02:57:53,030
Take the reins office.
Brian and brendan are fucking awesome.

4230
02:57:53,090 --> 02:57:55,550
They wanted to be on the internet,
but they wanted sensor.

4231
02:57:55,580 --> 02:57:58,010
That is so hilarious.
It's like we want to rate it x movie,

4232
02:57:58,011 --> 02:58:00,170
but with no fucking right.
It's dumb.

4233
02:58:00,350 --> 02:58:00,770
We're,
we're,

4234
02:58:00,771 --> 02:58:02,010
we're,
we're bringing up a lot of these

4235
02:58:02,010 --> 02:58:05,000
issues to them and drop it.
We're having a serious talk with.

4236
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:07,710
I have real sponsors that are like real 
companies.

4237
02:58:07,740 --> 02:58:09,360
You guys can have real sponsors too.
It does.

4238
02:58:09,720 --> 02:58:14,720
You can swear.
It's just words coming out of your 

4239
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:14,720
mouth.
Right?

4240
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:17,300
You know,
just don't show any pornography or 

4241
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:17,300
anything really ridiculous.
I agree.

4242
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:17,300
Come on fox.

4243
02:58:17,300 --> 02:58:22,251

Don't show they got you gone a little 

4244
02:58:22,251 --> 02:58:22,251
bit.
Don't show mr.

4245
02:58:22,251 --> 02:58:23,530
Sharp your cock,
your cat jack.

4246
02:58:23,610 --> 02:58:25,950
Get your dick in boston one time and
