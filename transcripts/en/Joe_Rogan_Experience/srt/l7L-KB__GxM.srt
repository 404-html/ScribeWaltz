1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,570
Is you're sick.
It's like those Mri,

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,980
two,
one,

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,870
Bam.
Yeah.

4
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:07,704
Dominick Cruz sitting here was looking 
at this thing called green belly meal 

5
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:11,184
meal to go.
The guy who created this is like this 

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,570
long distance hikers,
like he does those,

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,700
like do you know that trail?
What is it called?

8
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:19,840
The Appalachian trail that goes from of 
it,

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,890
you know of it?
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,083
What does it going from Georgia to Maine
or something crazy like that and these 

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,710
people walk.
It takes like six months.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah,
I'm into stuff like that.

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,390
That's like a whole different part of 
your life.

14
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,490
I feel like you get to when you do stuff
like that,

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,623
well you got to have a real commitment 
because you're not doing anything but 

16
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,780
that for six months.
Yeah.

17
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,614
It's a different lifestyle changes.
It's like a different time of your life 

18
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,400
I feel when you do something like that.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,050
Yeah.
But like being a fighter,

20
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,973
do you feel like,
like you're pretty limited as to what 

21
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,424
you can do outside of fighting your.
As far as like you're always recovering 

22
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,374
from training,
you're always involved in something 

23
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:01,830
related to either promotion or 
preparation.

24
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,420
Yeah,
agreed.

25
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,261
It's,
it's,

26
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:05,094
um,
I mean I'm not telling you anything you 

27
00:01:06,811 --> 00:01:08,890
don't know how many of these things have
you done with Delilah?

28
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,940
Lot done a lot.
You know,

29
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,813
that it's all or nothing because 
everybody's so good that if you don't 

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,240
invest every ounce of yourself into 
something,

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,030
there's somebody else to is in my 
opinion.

32
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:24,000
So it's like you have to do that or else
you get passed by.

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,070
Yeah.
And do you also feel like there's,

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,053
you have to be super objective to about 
where you stand and where your skills 

35
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,064
are at [inaudible] course you're always,
you're either at a point of constant 

36
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,340
improvement or you're at some sort of 
stagnation or decline.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,290
Yes.
Um,

38
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,243
I think sell.
But then that question always comes to 

39
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,694
mind according to win and loss ratio,
which doesn't always tell the truth 

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,223
because it's not always the fact.
It could just be a bad night and a good 

41
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:52,434
matchup and they had a game plan or you 
lost and now you're going to sit and go 

42
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,604
to the drawing board and say that 
everything was off because of one last 

43
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,430
really makes sense to me.
So it's kind of a mixture,

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,140
a,
you got to find the happy medium,

45
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,990
it comes down to trust in the people 
around you.

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,393
I'm not having nothing but yes men 
around you and I feel like as long as 

47
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:14,670
you have a good solid base of people 
that give the truth to you,

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,870
then you don't have to think with your 
emotion and you can think with logic and

49
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,704
then I think it's important to have 
those people around you so you don't 

50
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,960
steer off the course because even if 
you.

51
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,300
I mean,
even if you do have a loss,

52
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,493
it's not saying that everything is off,
but certainly something wasn't adequate 

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,433
in,
in that,

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,630
in that particular match.
Right?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,960
So you're just getting off of the second
loss ever of mixed martial arts career.

56
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,840
The first one you got caught by your 
ride with a guillotine.

57
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,160
And then the second one,
this,

58
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:44,851
uh,
cody,

59
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,180
no love fight.
And what,

60
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,670
what are your thoughts on it now having 
time to reflect and look back and I'm,

61
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,140
well my thoughts are a,
it,

62
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,530
I pretty much laid it all out

63
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,270
right away because I wanted to just do 
that at,

64
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,310
which was at the press conference,
the post fight press conference.

65
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,890
I pretty much just wanted to,
like,

66
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:09,724
I literally laid every ounce of every 
thought I had at that moment out there 

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,540
for everybody to hear in a point where 
on very vulnerable.

68
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:20,980
And I did that on purpose to show that 
we're not all,

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,870
you know,
the same.

70
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,690
Some people don't want to show their 
vulnerability.

71
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,320
Some people want to just be seen as only
perfect,

72
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,730
only tough,
only strong.

73
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,564
And really the truth of what makes the 
strongest people in the world is their 

74
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:36,400
vulnerability early until they learn how
to be tough.

75
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,900
And um,
you know,

76
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,853
losing is part of that lesson 
unfortunately for everybody and being 

77
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:46,120
unsuccessful as part of that lesson for,
for people just as much as losing.

78
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,910
So it's like you do what you can with 
it.

79
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,743
And that's how I feel now is like I do 
what I can with it and they only way to 

80
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,110
make the best of it is to accept it,
right?

81
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,180
The second it happens,
understand that,

82
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,210
um,
that's just the way it is.

83
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,690
That's the way that this has been slated
for this portion of my life.

84
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,870
And just move forward.
And as long as you embrace it,

85
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,240
don't make excuses for it.
And,

86
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,074
uh,
then you can actually look at what you 

87
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,950
did wrong and take it in the second you 
make an excuse.

88
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:15,910
The second you say,
well,

89
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,920
I was a little off here,
a little out there because of this,

90
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:18,754
this,
and this is the second you allow your 

91
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:22,180
mind to go into a path of,
um,

92
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,700
well,
it wasn't an,

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,593
it wasn't in my control,
which means you're not really dealing 

94
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:29,500
with the problems at hand,
I don't think.

95
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,990
I think you're kind of bypassing the 
problems at hand when you do that.

96
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,060
And then you can grow from the 
experience.

97
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,894
So what's the point of a loss if you're 
not going to grow from it and get the 

98
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,174
most out of it?
Now it's just useless if you don't 

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,020
accept it.
Yeah.

100
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:41,854
There's a real instinct that many 
fighters show like almost immediately 

101
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:45,994
after a loss to go right into what was 
wrong with the camp or what was wrong 

102
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,880
with an injury,
what they could've done differently,

103
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:56,881
personal problems and that that really 
can wreck havoc with your mind.

104
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,970
Correct.
I agree.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,833
I think,
I think more than wreaking havoc with 

106
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,724
your mind.
I think it just shows how long it's 

107
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,420
gonna take for them to get over the 
loss.

108
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,381
I mean,
that's the thing.

109
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,214
The second you just say it,
lay it all out there and everybody 

110
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,780
knows,
including yourself.

111
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,633
The next step is growth.
It's no longer stagnant and sitting in 

112
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,730
feeling the loss and trying to accept 
it.

113
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:20,950
I've already accepted it.
I accepted it.

114
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:25,180
The second I shook his hand in that 
octagon and and they,

115
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:26,014
they raised his hand is the winter like,
am I really going to sit here and make 

116
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:31,354
excuses because let's say on the judges'
scorecard I had some mindset that's 

117
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:37,121
like,
oh,

118
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,060
I shouldn't have lost the decision or 
maybe this,

119
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,350
maybe that.
It's like,

120
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,260
what's the point of that?
Because in the end,

121
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,570
it's already been chocked.
It's already there.

122
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,630
It's written down regardless of what 
anybody says.

123
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,420
It's not.
That's not leaving that piece of paper.

124
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,940
So what's the point of really saying all
this stuff,

125
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:56,260
letting people argue that,
well,

126
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,610
you could have one here,
you could have went,

127
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,463
what is where his argument anymore,
where's the logic and then where's the 

128
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,340
point and all that and I'm just sick and
tired of excuses.

129
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,174
I.
I've fought so many years winning so 

130
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:06,914
many years hearing so many excuses about
why I beat people and I wanted to set a 

131
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:13,010
perimeter right off the bat that I'm not
that person.

132
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,663
Now you're getting really well known as 
an MMA analysts and I think you do an 

133
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:18,594
amazing job on Fox.
I think you're one of the best guys in 

134
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:21,120
the world.
You're really,

135
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:21,954
really good at it,
but one of the things that people are 

136
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,533
getting a chance to see because of that 
is how your mind works and how much 

137
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,930
thought you put into not just fighting 
itself,

138
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:31,764
but the whole process.
The whole process of preparation and 

139
00:06:35,491 --> 00:06:38,700
mindset while the competition is going 
on.

140
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,773
And that's also being reflective right 
now and the way you express how you get 

141
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:45,660
over a loss.
Like where did,

142
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
where did wherever you learned to think 
like

143
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,720
this?
Well my mom is a big reason for that.

144
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,284
I would say early on she just always 
forced me to deal with the things I 

145
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,604
didn't want to deal with and not just 
deal with them but look at him in the 

146
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,350
eye and talk about it.
Like what kind of stuff?

147
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,540
Anything.
I'm like,

148
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,533
you still a packet of gum from the store
and you walk out with it and you're 

149
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,403
seven years old and you get home and 
you're eating a piece of gum and your 

150
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,410
mom goes,
I didn't buy that.

151
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,333
Where did you get that gum?
And we drive back with the gum in my 

152
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:15,950
mouth,
put it in the wrapper.

153
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,784
So the person at the front.
And that's not enough because I 

154
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,550
embarrassed the cash registers.
So I got to apologize to them.

155
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,920
And then I got to go to the owner of 
the,

156
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,160
of the other star,
the manager and apologize to them.

157
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,993
And then might have to go paint a wall 
forum to make up for the piece of gum 

158
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,231
that I,
I mean,

159
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,064
it goes all the way down to that,
like my mom has been that way since I 

160
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,120
can remember to where there's just 
there.

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,200
She would never ever let me make an 
excuse for anything I ever did ever.

162
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,183
And I used to get so frustrated with her
because she would also never really get 

163
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:51,230
mad.
She never raised her voice.

164
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,420
She would never really show a whole lot 
of emotion.

165
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,650
It was.
She would literally say,

166
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,750
I'm not going to yell.
I'm not going to scream.

167
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:57,710
I'm not gonna.
Get angry.

168
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,860
I'm not going to give you that power.
But that's one.

169
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,753
And that meant I was getting one 
whooping when I got home when I did 

170
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,094
something wrong.
And so now I got to sit and think about 

171
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,030
that for the next five hours until we 
get home.

172
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,560
And then she takes me into a room and 
she sits me down with no anger.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,300
Everything's understood.
And she says,

174
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,134
do you know why we're here?
And she explained to me why we're here 

175
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,164
and why I'm being,
why I'm in trouble and why I'm getting 

176
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:23,480
smacked on the ass with this breadboard.
And she just,

177
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,050
there was never any escaping anything 
ever.

178
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,033
So it's like,
it put me in this weird mindset where I 

179
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,054
just,
I don't make excuses and anybody who 

180
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:37,160
makes excuses,
I call them out on it because it's old.

181
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,330
It's annoying.
It's,

182
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,110
it's flawed in my opinion.
It's just weak.

183
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,700
That's a great lesson that that's a 
great way to be raised to your mom.

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,530
Not Perfect.
Don't get me wrong.

185
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm not saying I do this every time.
It's just something that's like made me,

186
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,050
uh,
that you asked.

187
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,470
I got that in my mind and it just,
it wired me a little different.

188
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,190
My grandma's a pretty,
pretty crazy on that too.

189
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,024
So between my grandmother and my mom who
helped raise me because my dad wasn't 

190
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,444
around so much,
those two molded me into this weird 

191
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,790
being.
Do you think they could have got through

192
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:17,660
it without beating you without a paddle?
No.

193
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:18,560
Absolutely.
No.

194
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,403
You think that wasn't part of it was me 
and my brother is too much little 

195
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,370
mutants in the trailer park.
Like we'd be.

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,473
We'd be fighting.
My Mom's at work wearing in the trailer 

197
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,734
and my.
We lived in a trailer across the street 

198
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,840
from my grandmother and it was like $400
a month,

199
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,703
you know,
to live in this trailer is one bedroom 

200
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,240
single wide.

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,073
She would come when we would fight,
we'd hear the door open and my grandma 

202
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,130
would be at the door,
me and my bro,

203
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,023
because you could hear a slamming into 
the floor because it's echoes from the 

204
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,540
bottom of the trailer.
Right.

205
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,810
And so she'd run across the street and.
Oh No,

206
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,580
we knew we were in trouble and my 
grandma came over.

207
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:52,830
It was bad news.
So I don't know.

208
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:55,160
It's just a weird upbringing,
kind of to an extending.

209
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,230
Everybody got raised by their family,
but by my mom and my grandmother,

210
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,053
it just,
it put a different mentality in me and 

211
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,380
my grandmother's very tough individual.
She'd been through a lot.

212
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,230
Now when you started fighting,
how did they approach it?

213
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,980
Yeah,
that's another odd thing is um,

214
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,460
my mom was just all support.
She,

215
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:16,710
even,
I was going to college when I started,

216
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,603
when I start just started,
I was coaching a local high school and 

217
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:21,770
one of the kids that I was coaching 
straight up,

218
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,643
I was 19 years old at this point and I 
just graduated High School and started 

219
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,130
coaching a local high school team 
because I wanted to compete wrestling.

220
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,993
Correct.
And I didn't get into college like I 

221
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,304
wanted to,
to wrestle and didn't do all these 

222
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,830
things,
so I just needed to compete.

223
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,810
So I got in the room and started 
coaching these kids.

224
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,090
Well they're my age.
I'm 18,

225
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,680
I'm 19,
I just graduated.

226
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:43,780
So we become friends.
One of these guys invites me to A.

227
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,330
Jimmy goes to jump in there and start 
training.

228
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:49,740
Right?
So during this time my mom,

229
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,350
I'm going to school,
so I'm working three jobs,

230
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,880
you know,
I'm working at Sherwin Williams,

231
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,560
I am a janitor at the gym and then I'm 
coaching this,

232
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,473
this high school wrestling team,
and then I'm going to school at night 

233
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:01,820
and I'm training in between that.
So these are,

234
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,070
this is what I'm doing in Tucson and 
during this time,

235
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,360
my,
I told my mom,

236
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,490
you know,
I'm just so tired of school.

237
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,490
I go to night school after my three 
jobs,

238
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,540
three jobs,
and then I go to night school at 8:00 PM

239
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,650
and I'm just wore out.

240
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,693
I'm sitting in Spanish class one day 
trying to learn like what I've been 

241
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,470
learning in high school and in Spanish 
class I'm like,

242
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,603
why am I paying for this school when I 
just did this class in high school and 

243
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:26,910
now I'm paying for it to get an 
associate's degree to go to another four

244
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,650
years in college and I'm going to be in 
debt for like,

245
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,690
what am I doing?
I don't want to be here.

246
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,320
I wasn't happy in school after all my 
days at work.

247
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,360
Um,
so I said,

248
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,194
you know,
the only time I felt free and happy it 

249
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,504
was in the gym.
That's the only time I could talk and 

250
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,770
laugh and smile and be myself hurting 
other people,

251
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,120
punching things,
kicking things,

252
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,520
yelling at things,
telling people how I felt.

253
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,320
And then if they had a problem,
we could fight about it.

254
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,640
I was at peace there.

255
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,550
Um,
so I,

256
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,400
I just going to school and said,
mom,

257
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,234
I'm going to start.
I'm going to start training to become a 

258
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,304
fighter.
I said they got the ultimate fighter 

259
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,280
going on.
Um,

260
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,640
it's a big thing.
It's growing.

261
00:12:00,641 --> 00:12:01,900
Now's the time.
If I'm going to do it,

262
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:03,460
I need to go all in.
She said,

263
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,294
okay,
you don't need to go to school to be 

264
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:06,730
successful.
You don't need to go to college.

265
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,603
Um,
follow your heart and you will be 

266
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,870
successful.
It's a guarantee.

267
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:13,750
And she was right.
Wow,

268
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,590
that's fascinating.
My mom has a weird spiritual,

269
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,480
emotional,
a way of talking,

270
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,660
explaining and getting through to me 
that I,

271
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,250
that can't be explained until you meet 
somebody like that will also.

272
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:28,971
It's not.
I mean,

273
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:29,804
it's,
there's no one that's ever going to be 

274
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,350
able to recreate that because she made 
you.

275
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,840
Yeah,
that's a good little.

276
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,850
I mean,
I think everybody's mom.

277
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,650
Everybody believes their mom has their.
I mean,

278
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,360
moms are special,
you know,

279
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,490
we all know that,
but every,

280
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,383
every person has their own way that they
were raised and brought up and then 

281
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,980
they,
they pass that onto their child.

282
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:49,390
My mom had a hard life,
you know,

283
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,930
so I think she just so wise that she 
passed a lot of,

284
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,173
um,
a lot of wisdom off to me young because 

285
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:58,744
she just growing up and raising us broke
like she did by herself I think just 

286
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:03,784
taught her so much that she didn't want 
us to have to live and he kind of 

287
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:06,904
struggled life like that.
So she made us learn the hard way with 

288
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,054
her instead of her taking everything and
not teaching us anything we lived at 

289
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,360
with her and grew in the experience with
her.

290
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,170
And then that got added to my life and 
what I wanted to do moving forward.

291
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,870
Now you developed a really unusual 
fighting style.

292
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,793
I mean,
I think I've said about you that one of 

293
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,034
the more unusual things about your style
is that I could watch you like as a 

294
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:34,614
silhouette.
Someone could show me a silhouette of 

295
00:13:37,071 --> 00:13:38,200
you moving around.
I go,

296
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:39,120
oh,
that's dominick Cruz.

297
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,073
There's very few people that you would 
say that about like where you would 

298
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,520
instantaneously recognize their 
movements,

299
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:49,310
like your movements are very unusual,
very difficult to pattern and a,

300
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,860
they're not really indicative of like a 
style.

301
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,280
Like you know,
there's the Thai style.

302
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,540
People have that light front leg.
There's a karate style,

303
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,450
like wonder Boy Thompson.
There's a bunch of styles where you go,

304
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:01,650
oh,
I see what this guy's doing.

305
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,270
Your style is very uniquely yours.
What,

306
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,150
what,
what sort of caused that?

307
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,170
Where'd that come from?

308
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,330
It's a mixture of things as I've been 
fighting since,

309
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,630
as long as the Diaz brothers I started 
when I was 19 years old,

310
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:21,580
back in 2005,
and I've been doing it since then.

311
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,414
So that's part of it is that just years 
and years of fighting and facing 

312
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:26,890
different people and seeing what the 
issues were,

313
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,870
but more than that,
it was built around the fact that I knew

314
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,760
whether I,
whether,

315
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,180
whether I knew I was ahead or not,
my mindset said I have to fight,

316
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,093
do something different because this is a
new sport with new rules and new 

317
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,600
different equipment than it's ever been 
seen in the history of this world.

318
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,630
So that means there's four ounce gloves 
were using kicks,

319
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:50,830
knees,
elbows and hands,

320
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,033
right?
All I,

321
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,410
uh,
all eight limbs.

322
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,970
So I said I need to make sure that I'm 
not taking damage.

323
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,873
Um,
as long as I'm not taking damage I 

324
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:02,360
should.

325
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,193
When I got to be hard to hit on my 
defense needs to be flawless with these 

326
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,130
size gloves is not going to be the same 
as boxing.

327
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:07,964
I can't just sit here and cover like 
this because my gloves or a quarter of 

328
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:14,180
the size things peak in and I learned 
that real quick and so I said,

329
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:15,800
all right,
so I need to move nonstop.

330
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,634
I can't sit still like I do in boxing or
kickboxing because you're going to get 

331
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,010
taken down as well,
so that's.

332
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,380
That's where my mind started changing 
his with the takedown.

333
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,273
That's where I knew I really had to do 
something different is in no striking 

334
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,340
sport on earth is their takedown 
involved,

335
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,910
so that means that I need to attack on a
different plane and that means I need to

336
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,470
not be down the center line as long as I
fight,

337
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:40,460
not down the center line.

338
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,293
It takes away a.
As long as I don't fight on the center 

339
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:48,830
line all the time.
It takes away my almost all weapons from

340
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:49,664
all styles.
Boxing is probably the one style that 

341
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,684
flows most off the center line,
but we're talking about Moitai or we're 

342
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,484
talking about wrestling or talking about
a judo or we're talking about it almost 

343
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:03,554
every other martial art.
They attack down a straight line and so 

344
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,483
I knew I could take away most of their 
weapons just by changing the plane that 

345
00:16:11,661 --> 00:16:12,494
I fought on.
If I fought on a different plane than 

346
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:16,340
them,
then they would not have answers for the

347
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,860
plane that I'm fighting it because 
everything they do is on that line.

348
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,870
So instead of fighting them in their 
style,

349
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:22,610
I fought the lines that they're fighting
on.

350
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,220
And then that kind of changed things 
mixed with the defense.

351
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,423
Well,
I've always enjoyed watching you fight 

352
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,254
and I've always enjoyed explaining how 
you fight the people that have never 

353
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,450
seen martial arts.
I don't understand it because for people

354
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,284
on the outside,
maybe someone who's not a fan or never 

355
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,650
did any martial arts training,
they,

356
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:40,400
they look at it like just violence,
you know?

357
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,920
They see guys just beating the shit out 
of each other and what I.

358
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,650
The way I tried to describe it to a 
friend once I said,

359
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,870
think about it this way,
it's,

360
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,580
it's a lot like a conversation and the 
more words you have at your disposal,

361
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:54,414
the more verbal memory you have,
the more you to stringing together 

362
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:58,194
sentences you are,
the more fluently the conversation is 

363
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:01,614
going to come out of your mouth,
the more it's going to flow and when 

364
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:06,900
you're watching,
and then I'll show someone like you when

365
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,590
you're trying to have call called a 
conversation,

366
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,510
you're trying to have a conversation 
with Dominic Cruz inside the octagon.

367
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,200
You don't know where the fuck he's going
like you,

368
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,034
you,
you're setting up so many weird angles 

369
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:20,250
and so much weird movements,
so many false entries,

370
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,430
and there's so much going on that you 
were in a lot of ways,

371
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:28,200
you're overloading a person's reactions.
You're overloading their mind.

372
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,120
Well,
that is partially what I'm trying to do.

373
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:31,960
Yes,
I agree.

374
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,430
Now you're starting to see that over 
time there's an answer for every style.

375
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,340
There's an answer for everything.
Yeah,

376
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,850
and that's the fun of this thing is that
it's not stagnant.

377
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,880
It's not always the same.
Um,

378
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,150
and there,
there isn't answered everything that's,

379
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,950
and then you got to adjust.
So I'm,

380
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,933
that's what I'm on his adjustments.
My whole game is built on adjustment so 

381
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,590
it can always change and always look 
different because every round I come out

382
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,780
with a different adjustment off of what 
you did to me.

383
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,440
And now you're fighting a different guy 
every round you just don't know it.

384
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,873
Um,
but that comes from fakes and seeing 

385
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,200
what they want on you.
And that comes from their game plan.

386
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,630
It's a whole mixture reads in there.
And that's a,

387
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,670
that's something that you either have or
you don't have.

388
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,503
You know,
somebody like Anderson Silva can make 

389
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:19,860
reeds extremely quickly and that's 
what's made him so successful.

390
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,380
Demetrius Johnson reads extremely 
quickly,

391
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,380
makes them successful.
The best in the world had just,

392
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,130
um,
and the best for me,

393
00:18:29,131 --> 00:18:32,820
the best in the world aren't the ones 
who just when it's someone's who win and

394
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,654
stay on top for a long period of time 
because now you don't just have a style 

395
00:18:38,231 --> 00:18:41,160
to win a fight.
You have a style to stay winning,

396
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,593
which means that your style hits so many
different avenues that you can compete 

397
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,084
with all these different styles no 
matter what they match you up against 

398
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,950
until now,
my style,

399
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,580
I built it so that no matter which style
you try to throw at me,

400
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,713
it was going to give it a problem and 
that was the basis that I wanted to 

401
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,560
create.
When I fought,

402
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,020
every single time I fought somebody,
it was,

403
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,913
it doesn't matter what your gift is,
the planes that I'm going to fight you 

404
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,424
on,
make it impossible for your gifts to be 

405
00:19:09,571 --> 00:19:10,404
your gifts anymore.

406
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,230
Now I've seen you practice no senior 
footwork drills and I've seen you know a

407
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,420
lot of your steps and the different 
various entries.

408
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:23,421
You have techniques or these moves that 
you've learned from somewhere.

409
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,160
Have you acquired them from other 
martial arts?

410
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:26,994
Have you sort of adjusted them and 
adapted them or did you figure them out 

411
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:31,430
your own?
It's been a mixture.

412
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,273
Working with Eric Tell Pharaoh was a 
huge step because I had a lot of 

413
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:36,030
naturals,
one of the best coaches in the sport and

414
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,790
one of the most underappreciated gods 
because he doesn't blow his own horn.

415
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,803
That's why I love them.
I liked the coaches that don't need the 

416
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:45,270
pats on the back for themselves.
They're about the athlete.

417
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,520
Eric is about every athlete he's ever 
coached.

418
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,370
He's not about himself.
He's great corner man too.

419
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,890
When he starts talking in the corner,
he knows what he's doing.

420
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,723
He's been in this sport 20 plus years 
and I'm the bigger thing that Eric 

421
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,124
doesn't get credit for.
It is his understanding of the 

422
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:03,720
psychology that goes into preparing 
somebody to win a fight.

423
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,120
You could have all the tools around that
person.

424
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,070
They could be the best human being on 
earth,

425
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,113
but if their mind is not pieced together
and the psychological pieces are not 

426
00:20:11,941 --> 00:20:12,774
there,
you're not going to be able to trigger 

427
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:15,390
them and get them in the fight when you 
need to.

428
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:17,520
Jeremy Stevens,
a great example of somebody like that.

429
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,563
Sometimes you gotta like get crazy with 
that dude in the corner and like even 

430
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,430
like slap him around a little bit maybe 
and he's just goes and he'll,

431
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,443
he'll kill somebody.
It's like there's a psychological thing 

432
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,320
about certain athletes that you have to 
be able to touch on.

433
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,193
Same with Greg Jackson is another guy 
who can do that and that's what makes a 

434
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,370
good coach on that night,
a good corner man on that night.

435
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,030
Not just what you did for eight weeks 
holding pads and uh,

436
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,883
you know,
patting the guy in the back and wiping 

437
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:48,520
the sweat off their shoulders and know,
know doing interviews and looking famous

438
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,181
with them.
Like,

439
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:52,000
what are you doing to make sure this 
person wins on that night?

440
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,753
Not what are you doing to make sure you 
look good in this person's corner while 

441
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:57,184
he wins.
And that's something that I've run into 

442
00:20:59,051 --> 00:20:59,884
a lot with people,
is people a lot want to associate 

443
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,980
themselves with you when you're winning 
and not actually be there for you but be

444
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,020
there so they look good in your corner 
while you win.

445
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,910
And those are the people you got to cut 
out.

446
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:11,560
Those are the yes men.
And those are,

447
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,150
those are the ones that you got to be 
careful with.

448
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:15,380
Eric is the opposite of that.
Um,

449
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,110
and he is somebody that's why I stick 
with them.

450
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,510
You someday I can trust.
He understands my psychology,

451
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:23,260
understands my emotional roller coaster 
of outside life,

452
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,210
personal life,
fight life,

453
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,103
everything makes together.
We've gone through this together and 

454
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,000
then he's an,
he's a trustworthy person.

455
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,750
They're not a lot of people you can 
trust in this industry these days are in

456
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,240
fighting in general boxing or MMA.
So it's hard.

457
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,363
He knows his stuff and he is underrated.
And I think the fact that he doesn't 

458
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,530
toot his own horn,
he doesn't get on these interviews.

459
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,520
A does hurt him a little.
Um,

460
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,550
but that was what was hurting me early 
in my career to where a lot of light and

461
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,750
I had to,
I had to say,

462
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:53,584
if I'm going to make a living,
if I'm going to really do this fight 

463
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,920
thing,
I better start stepping this media thing

464
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:57,754
up.
I better start stepping up this portion 

465
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,154
that we're doing right here and get 
figured out a way to make it because 

466
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:03,544
this is the.
This is part of the sports where you no 

467
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:08,320
longer always fighting who deserves,
who's the best in the world.

468
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:12,700
You're now fighting in this era,
the best superstar,

469
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,833
not just the best athlete and so you got
to be a happy mixture and when you can 

470
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:20,050
figure that out,
you start piecing your career together.

471
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:22,000
You look at Eric del Faro hasn't figured
that out.

472
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:22,834
He doesn't want to.
He doesn't care about it and so you 

473
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,620
don't know about them too,

474
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,160
what you showed the best people know 
about it,

475
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,000
belt mill,
about him rather now it's.

476
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,950
That's an interesting thing that you put
that up too because it seems like.

477
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,490
I mean,
it doesn't just seem like it.

478
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:40,550
It is both fighters in general and 
trainers almost all at one point in time

479
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:43,140
we're fighters or at least martial 
artists.

480
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,113
The there were a lot of them are broken.
People looking to rebuild and that's 

481
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:48,584
what martial arts Dunn's does for them.
That's what fighting and competing does 

482
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:52,160
for them.
It gives them an identity,

483
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:57,161
it gives them a sense of purpose and a 
sense of a sense of worth and that those

484
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,333
types of people oftentime get very 
selfish and it's very difficult to find 

485
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:07,880
someone that you trust enough to let 
them all in and then once they do,

486
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,220
they're intensely connected.
Correct.

487
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,143
You know,
I mean the bonds that you have with 

488
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:16,070
people that you train with and people 
that you spar with on a regular basis or

489
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,290
people that you've competed with and 
gone to places with.

490
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,573
I don't think people that don't expect,
I don't think people that have never 

491
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,444
experienced such an intense competition 
will ever truly understand that kind of 

492
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:28,280
a bomb that people share.

493
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,730
I agree.
And ironically,

494
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:32,564
just by chance,
pretty much every one of the closest 

495
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:34,904
friends in my life,
I have fought almost to a bloody death 

496
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,163
and that's what's so crazy.
I know that and then you can't lie to 

497
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:43,634
me.
There is nothing you're going to lie to 

498
00:23:44,781 --> 00:23:47,000
me because if you lie to me,
I'm going to see you on Monday,

499
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,300
80th and we're going to see what you're 
made of.

500
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,870
You'll know anyway.
I mean,

501
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,970
without even knowing what they're made 
of,

502
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,833
you'll know their lines,
but it's different when you fight 

503
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:57,830
somebody,
you literally know what they're made of.

504
00:23:57,831 --> 00:23:58,664
When you see the look in their eye and 
they say what they say and they do what 

505
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:03,254
they do and then they go and they fight 
and they don't say what they say and 

506
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:05,864
they don't do what they do and that's 
just fighting and that's what's so 

507
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,680
refreshing about it to me.

508
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,581
Yeah.
Well,

509
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,500
the psychological aspect of it.
I mean,

510
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,100
you know who.
Who was it that said this fighting is 90

511
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,220
percent mental and the other 10 percent 
in your head.

512
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,530
I forget who said that.
I remember either,

513
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:23,270
but I heard it.
That's a great quote.

514
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,270
I don't remember who said it,
but I believe it with all my heart.

515
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,163
There's so many people out there.
There's so incredibly physically 

516
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:29,684
talented.
And how many Jim assassins do you know 

517
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,310
that for whatever reason they just can't
put it together to care.

518
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,970
When the referee says,
fighter,

519
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,620
are you ready fighter?
Are you ready to go?

520
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,370
They just aren't a fraction of who they 
really are.

521
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,480
Just really break down and think about 
what happens to the ones that do make it

522
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,780
and then have to deal with the media and
uh,

523
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,050
opinions and I really feel like 
athletes,

524
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:54,963
the biggest hurdle is the fact that 
we're willing to actually just get up 

525
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,270
there and say we might,
when we might lose and just put that out

526
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:03,104
there and say,
are you willing to put yourself out 

527
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:05,894
there like that?

528
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,110
Are you willing to embarrass yourself?
If you do lose,

529
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,333
are you willing to deal with the media?
If you win for 10 years straight and 

530
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,514
then lose and then now you're the worst 
guy that's ever been seen in the sport 

531
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:21,680
or the worst female that's ever been 
seen the sport.

532
00:25:21,681 --> 00:25:24,950
You didn't even belong there.
Are you able to deal with that?

533
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,160
That's the question.
That's what being an athlete is not.

534
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,260
Well those would be an fighter.
Yeah.

535
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,780
Big Difference Between basketball game.
What's true.

536
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,673
You lose a basketball game and people 
might think you're a fucking loser or a 

537
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:36,434
scrub,
but it's nothing like the shit that I 

538
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,040
see fighters face online.
No,

539
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:40,874
I mean just look at.
I got to bring Ronda Rousey up because 

540
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,870
it's heartbreaking for me as an athlete.
I know what she's feeling,

541
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:52,640
I know what she's going through and um,
as a female it's even on another level.

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,473
I can't really imagine that just it's a 
different level of scrutiny I would 

543
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,400
imagine.
But um,

544
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,253
it's just,
it shows how hard it is to deal with 

545
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:02,654
this man,
the ups and downs because the downs hit 

546
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:07,244
hard just as hard as the upset and you 
got to be ready and there can't be any 

547
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:14,420
separation and who you are with a win 
and a loss because if there is,

548
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:15,254
it's going to show and you gotta be who 
you are and not be solely connected to 

549
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:22,610
fighting as your whole being.
Otherwise you're over when,

550
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,930
when it,
when it ends,

551
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,973
right.
There was something about the Ronda 

552
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,780
Rousey promos that I always felt like I 
didn't like hearing it.

553
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,043
Like she was like,
I gotta get back to fighting because 

554
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,900
it's the most important thing and it's a
thing that I can be best in the world.

555
00:26:37,901 --> 00:26:38,810
And I was like,
Ooh,

556
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,030
I actually like hearing that studio.

557
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,043
I do.
And the reason is it such a lesson if 

558
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:45,024
you really listening in between the 
lines to the issue of the world and 

559
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,154
that's just my opinion.
We're all putting so much into this one 

560
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:56,640
thing and we think that that is our 
everything when really if she.

561
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,623
It sounds cheesy,
but if you put all that energy towards 

562
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:01,590
loving yourself and not the fight 
career,

563
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,410
the fight career will still be there 
just as heavy as it is.

564
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,820
Right.
You know,

565
00:27:05,821 --> 00:27:06,654
so what I mean is she's using the 
fighting as her identity with that 

566
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:11,274
championship belt.
She is Ronda Rousey the Ronda Rousey 

567
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,260
without the championship belt.
We don't know who she is.

568
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:19,170
She won't come out.
So who are you?

569
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,500
Unless you're winning,
we don't know.

570
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:25,890
Do you know you're counting on that belt
to know who you are now.

571
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,930
And that's.
That was my biggest point.

572
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,750
That was a hurdle I ran into when I lost
my belt.

573
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,290
I didn't know who I was anymore.
And that's how I knew this.

574
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,140
That's how I figured out what my issues 
were is.

575
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,930
All right dom,
you're getting ready to fight brow.

576
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,741
You Ready?
Yes,

577
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,820
I'm ready.
Screw it,

578
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:43,250
let's do it.
These,

579
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,440
these,
these nice cast.

580
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,980
Tommy's injuries can blow your lawyer 
quad out.

581
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:48,900
Now you're out of that fight.
Now we're taking your belt.

582
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,293
Well,
for people that don't know what we're 

583
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:51,734
going to about to be talking about,
you had one of the most horrific injury 

584
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:58,670
streaks in the sport in your prime.
You know,

585
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:59,504
you were considered to be one of the top
pound for pound fighters in the world 

586
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,750
and then you had a series of 
catastrophic injuries and surgeries.

587
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,823
So for this is for a lot of people 
listening to podcasts and aren't really 

588
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,823
hardcore MMA that makes.
So you like to talk us through it 

589
00:28:13,731 --> 00:28:14,564
because you went through like one of the
most difficult trials in terms of 

590
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:20,000
recovery from injury?
Any?

591
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,063
No,
the most difficult I've ever seen 

592
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:26,480
anybody go through and the entire 
history of my time of colon fights

593
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,783
hiding.
I definitely agree in the sport of the 

594
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,660
score to the nfl because I researched 
him.

595
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,370
Oh,
okay.

596
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,203
These guys who went through three acl 
reconstructions came back and compete 

597
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,660
and one of them was just competing on.
They almost made it to the superbowl and

598
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,410
he had three acl reconstructions in the 
game of football and came back,

599
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,600
was still playing and he was like over 
there,

600
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:47,750
over 30.
Wow.

601
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,680
And people like that need to be around 
in this world.

602
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,560
Sure.
Just to let you know that it's possible.

603
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:56,650
You know that it can be done in and now 
it's kind of what I what gay.

604
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,340
That mindset right there,
when you make it bigger than yourself is

605
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,690
the only way you get the power to get 
through.

606
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:02,524
Stuff like that,
and that's what got me through is 

607
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:07,120
understanding that I go through this,
these knee surgeries,

608
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:07,840
I,
I,

609
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,770
I become.

610
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,410
It becomes bigger than me when I come 
back and succeed.

611
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,600
It's not just about me coming back and 
getting my belt.

612
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,390
I already had belts.
I already knew what it felt like to be a

613
00:29:16,391 --> 00:29:19,780
five time world champion by that point.
At the age of 26,

614
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,690
before I blew my knee out,
I was on top of everything.

615
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,080
I had everything that I thought I needed
in one.

616
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:28,420
It blew my knee out,
get my belt stripped,

617
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:33,190
go through three acl reconstructions.
You soon find out that you actually have

618
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:35,220
no idea who you are.
What?

619
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,000
No.
What was the initial injury?

620
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,160
Uh,
acl,

621
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:39,930
MCL.
What,

622
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,900
what,
what happened though?

623
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
I was a training while I was getting 
ready on the ultimate fighter back in 

624
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:47,524
2012 or 11 for Faber fight.
We were getting ready to compete at the 

625
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,050
end of the show and I was training with 
a guy and it was just a hard week.

626
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,130
I mean we're,
we're,

627
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,983
we were the first show that I ever went 
live and was training for the fight at 

628
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:01,444
the same time being tough.
We're the only first and only live show 

629
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,274
that they did.
So that meant that while we coached we 

630
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:11,140
were also going to compete at the same 
time.

631
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,423
So like I had to do my fight camp while 
I trained the ultimate fighter guys 

632
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,580
simultaneously.
So I was doing four practices a day,

633
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,443
two at the tough guys in tune with 
myself and that work load is just 

634
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,520
insane.
That was a hard,

635
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,430
hard training camp and ended up breaking
me down.

636
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,693
I hurt my knee just sparring.
It was aspiring day guy went for 

637
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,630
graphing transition in my and a Sagd to 
my hip,

638
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:36,810
weird and just blew my knee out a crappy
takedown,

639
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,773
you know where they sag instead of 
actually get the take down and it just 

640
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,320
blew my knee out.

641
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,020
When I blew my acl MCL I was.
I was like,

642
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:45,310
it's all right.
You'll be fine.

643
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:48,530
I fought it.
I almost literally fought injury.

644
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,660
Like,
you're too tough.

645
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:50,860
You're too strong.
You're too young.

646
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:52,690
You can do this.
Let's go for the injury.

647
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:54,880
Meaning knocked at surgery and try to 
rehab it.

648
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:58,120
You just heard what I just said,
like it didn't mentally.

649
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Right.
Did the surgery?

650
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:02,230
I did.
That wasn't the problem though.

651
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,093
That's my point.
The problem is if you're doing all the 

652
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:05,824
things right to get better,
it's understanding that it was 

653
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:12,184
understanding that I didn't need to 
fight to be better giving up on it was 

654
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:22,141
when I finally got better understanding.
I didn't need fighting to be who I was.

655
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,520
When you say get better,
you mean get better emotionally,

656
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:28,450
psychologically will physically,
even physically.

657
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,343
So physically I didn't.
I did not get better until I gave up on 

658
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,890
fighting the injury and what I mean by 
fighting the injuries saying it's,

659
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,270
you'll be fine,
you'll come back,

660
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,380
just keep training,
keep training,

661
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,220
keep training,
keep training.

662
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,420
And I and I trained but in the law,
in the logic that I was given with my,

663
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,923
uh,
what I'm allowed to do according to my 

664
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,140
physical therapist,
Gavin Mcmillan,

665
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,100
he would say,
you can do this,

666
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:52,570
this and this.
Don't push it.

667
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,610
I wouldn't push it.
I would do the things aloud,

668
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,470
but I'm telling you,
like,

669
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,423
that wasn't the issue.
The issue was surrendering to the issue 

670
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:03,490
is knowing that fighting was the only 
way I was going to be happy.

671
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:08,110
Then it was being able to compete was 
the only way I could find peace.

672
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:10,120
Being able to prove that I was as good 
as I always was,

673
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:15,121
even after the injuries became 
everything that I was trying to do it.

674
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,570
It was just a nonstop fight to just get 
healthy.

675
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:25,410
And I get through my second acl 
reconstruction on the same knee.

676
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,200
Then I blow my quad out before I was 
supposed to fight.

677
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,190
How did you blow out the second one?
You,

678
00:32:31,191 --> 00:32:33,070
you had the injury,
you had it reconstructed.

679
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,020
And then how,
how do you blow out the second one?

680
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,213
It's the same knee and I was training on
Christmas how many months after the 

681
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:43,910
initial surgery?
Six.

682
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,773
So it's real reason.
It's probably not 100 percent healed 

683
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,720
yet.
It's not 100 percent healed yet.

684
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,860
Nine months is supposed to be full,
full strength,

685
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,743
but that.
But six month is when you get to start 

686
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,503
pushing it to get ready to fall.
So now you're like six months to six 

687
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:00,824
months.
You're not allowed to do any kind of 

688
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,290
cutting.
Connie.

689
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,110
Meeting science,
lateral movements just straight down the

690
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:06,710
line.
No,

691
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,210
nothing risky.
Uh,

692
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,150
keep your brace on.
When you trained at a six month mark,

693
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,170
they're like,
take the brace off.

694
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,970
You've got to start getting the 
stabilizers strong.

695
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:16,430
You can start testing it more.
You can start doing things,

696
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:20,030
but you still got to wear a brace when 
you do live scenarios.

697
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,530
But you can drill without it.
You can,

698
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,400
you see what I'm saying?

699
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,323
So you're actually pretty strong,
but now it's supposed to be strong 

700
00:33:25,731 --> 00:33:30,110
enough that it's not going to tear.
But that's when I had a cadaver acl,

701
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,840
so it wasn't as strong as it should have
been at that,

702
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,560
at that six month point,
because it was cadaver tissue.

703
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,480
My Body did not adapt to the tissue as 
well as it could have.

704
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,863
So they,
do they do an Mri to see where it's at 

705
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,500
or do they just kind of base it on how 
it feels?

706
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,753
They base it on the endpoint and the 
stability of your knee and then 

707
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,160
manipulate it when they manipulate it at
the six month mark,

708
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:52,994
you're going in every two to three weeks
for six months to double check with the 

709
00:33:56,211 --> 00:33:57,044
dogs.
I've had to have a two week while I was 

710
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:02,090
doing that at Kerlan and jobe and they 
were good doctors and they tried to stay

711
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,924
on me,
you know?

712
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,030
Um,
so you've had two.

713
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:06,770
So you know,
and you know,

714
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:07,604
at the six month mark it's like you can 
push it but you don't want to overkill 

715
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:12,794
it,
tear it.

716
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,540
Right.
So the second one,

717
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,510
I wasn't over killing it,
but I was doing what I was allowed in my

718
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:20,660
brace and I made a,
I made a cut,

719
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,860
like a turn and it just popped it just 
like,

720
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,550
it wasn't anything like,
oh I shouldn't have been doing that.

721
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,050
It was Kinda like,
you know,

722
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,870
I was boxing in my brace.
I had it taped,

723
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,960
I warmed up,
I surprised I was uh,

724
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,190
doing drills,
boxing drills,

725
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,010
drills,
yeah,

726
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,843
boxing drills,
but you just pivot wrong then and it 

727
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:42,980
just pops and then,
you know,

728
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,080
like I remember sitting there and I'd 
just,

729
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:48,620
the pain's very specific and then it 
goes away too quick.

730
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,573
That's when,
you know,

731
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,840
because it's their real,
real,

732
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,040
real,
real hard pain.

733
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,873
And then it goes away in like two 
minutes because the ligaments that now 

734
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:56,420
you don't have pain anymore.
And I'm like,

735
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,330
oh no.
So I sit down and I go,

736
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,500
all right,
my name is torn.

737
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,130
And that was when I hit like a real bad 
rock bottom on that one.

738
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,710
That was like that one,
like,

739
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,530
oh my gosh,
when I went to the MRI and got home,

740
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:13,880
I literally like called my friend and I 
told him to come over and I just,

741
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,923
I mean I pretty much just drink as much 
of a bottle as I could because I was in 

742
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,120
pretty good shape at that point.
So it put me out.

743
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:20,954
I passed out my head was,
I woke up in my porch with my head on 

744
00:35:23,661 --> 00:35:25,370
the grill in the morning,
just a mess.

745
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,310
It was not pretty,
but I didn't even care because I was out

746
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:29,490
for nine months,
you know,

747
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,090
so everybody hits these lows,
you know,

748
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,780
what were you doing financially back 
then?

749
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,590
Because that's where it gets rough.
Right.

750
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,920
That's another part of it.
I mean,

751
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:41,130
US athletes,
we all know or you know,

752
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,180
uh,
we,

753
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,850
we only make money when we,
when we fight for the prize,

754
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,420
you know.
And um,

755
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,941
thank God,
you know,

756
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,680
Lorenzo and in the UFC they gave me a 
decent chunk of money for a good part of

757
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:53,514
time.
While I had the belt and then once they 

758
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,793
took the belt,
I stopped getting that chunk of money 

759
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:57,894
even when I was hurt.
So they were paying me a little bit a 

760
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:01,680
stipend while I was hurt and that helped
me.

761
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,873
And then when I left,
when they stripped the belt and gave it 

762
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:05,034
to broad,
they stopped with that because I'm not 

763
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,910
the champion anymore.
And then it was kinda like,

764
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,050
that's what,
that's what I mean,

765
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,910
that's when it Kinda went,
got turned reality.

766
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,810
Like you're not the champ on paper 
anymore.

767
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,550
He didn't really lose it.
But that's it.

768
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,770
So what are you going to do?
What is this it,

769
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,970
you know,
how you're going to make money,

770
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,800
how are you going to do this?
How are you going to do that?

771
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,530
And I panicked.
Um,

772
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,370
but I knew that I was gonna still come 
back and fight because I was still young

773
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,210
and I hadn't given up on fighting yet.
Still only in my second acl surgery.

774
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:36,570
So I'm still not fully admitting that 
I'm not,

775
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,420
that I'm a mess,
right.

776
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,550
I,
I'm kind of not really like admitting it

777
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:42,990
to myself yet.
And it's,

778
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:44,300
screw what you're saying,
everybody else's,

779
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,620
what I'm trying to say,
it's what you believe to yourself is all

780
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,520
that matters,
right.

781
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,230
Period.
And I was like,

782
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,700
I'll be fine.
This isn't that bad.

783
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,690
I can do this.

784
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,200
Gone through worse.
So in doing it,

785
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,170
I still hadn't really just given up yet.
And that's.

786
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:00,900
So I'm still,
I'm still competing in my mind,

787
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,400
which is the problem.
And uh,

788
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,343
that's when you just,
you're overworking and not just doing 

789
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:09,000
things you're not supposed to on your 
knee.

790
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:12,180
But just in general in life on just 
overworking.

791
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,230
I'm doing my Fox stuff now to make money
and then I'm trying to do my rehab,

792
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,083
uh,
five days a week because I have to come 

793
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,920
back and fight for the belt when I come 
back.

794
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:23,210
And that's another thing people don't 
equate as I was the champs.

795
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,480
I got to come back and fight for the 
belt.

796
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,314
When I come back after this injury,
I don't just get to come back and fight 

797
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:28,074
somebody three rounds.
I got to come back and fight five 

798
00:37:30,061 --> 00:37:32,220
rounds.
Never been done before.

799
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,200
I had nobody to bounce this thought off 
of,

800
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,870
um,
I just had to wing it man.

801
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,110
And so I was,
and that caused,

802
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:40,944
I think,
a lot of problems with me because I 

803
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:42,384
didn't have the mental capacity to deal 
with it at that point with all the 

804
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:45,894
things that I was doing.
So I just kept grinding and then I 

805
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:51,540
finally get back to health after the 
second acl,

806
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,930
six months,
nine months goes by.

807
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,700
All right,
let's take this brow fight.

808
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:59,130
So I'm ready.
I'm training in camp.

809
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,160
About a month in m I t I have like a 
weird pinch in my groin.

810
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,600
It turns out to be the exact same 
injury.

811
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:07,434
Daniel cormier just pulled out of the 
fight for it's the extensor tendon in 

812
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,240
your or?
No,

813
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:14,310
it's the um,
uh,

814
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,490
I forget the name of the.
There's a tendon in your groin area that

815
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:19,020
pulls and then you got to just rest it.

816
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I tore the mine was a little bit worse.
I tore the muscle,

817
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,500
the quad muscle off the bone,
so it's like separated from the bone,

818
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,320
but it wasn't all the way.
It was just enough that it was,

819
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,573
I could still like think I was okay,
but it would fail on me occasionally so 

820
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:38,300
I could tape it some days and it would 
be all right.

821
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,150
Shoot a bunch of Toradol,
which is a,

822
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,280
for anybody who's curious.
It's a natural.

823
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,180
It's,
um,

824
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,040
legal,
anti-inflammatory.

825
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,080
A lot of football players take it.
Um,

826
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,410
Toridol Toridol it's A.
Yeah,

827
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,340
I think that's,
yeah,

828
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,320
I think that's what it's called,
but anyways,

829
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,770
it's,
it's a natural urge to anti-inflammatory

830
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,501
now.
Natural one,

831
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,070
but it's like Ibuprofen but stronger and
I would take that and that helped.

832
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,670
Um,
but it just,

833
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,593
it wasn't right.
I remember I was sparring one day and I 

834
00:39:06,491 --> 00:39:07,324
went to throw a right hand and my leg 
just gave out and I fell on the floor 

835
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,860
and I wasn't kicking,
I wasn't shooting.

836
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,360
I just threw a right hand and the 
feeling of falling because I threw right

837
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:17,360
hand,
made me know,

838
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:18,194
like something wasn't connected.
Like it just didn't feel right because 

839
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:22,570
they just failed me.
It wasn't,

840
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,763
it wasn't like it hurt and I stopped it 
just literally there was no pain and it 

841
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,600
just failed.
And I was like,

842
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:30,730
something's way mechanically wrong with 
me.

843
00:39:30,731 --> 00:39:33,220
I can't fight mechanically wrong like 
this.

844
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:35,530
And that was about four weeks out of the
fight,

845
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:36,730
three,
four weeks out of the fight.

846
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,250
I had already done a month camp with 
this injury,

847
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,410
trying to tough it out.
So my camp was rough.

848
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,780
It was a heart camp and I didn't want to
pull out,

849
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,673
obviously naturally.
So I ended up calling Dana and in this 

850
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:50,370
one of the few phone calls I've ever had
with Dana.

851
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:51,204
Unfortunately in this,
probably one of the times you remember 

852
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,670
telling them,
I'm sorry I got to pull out.

853
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,680
But I remember not wanting to have my 
manager column this.

854
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:58,514
This goes back to what my mom,
how my mom put something in my head 

855
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:04,110
where you deal with this face to face or
talking.

856
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,080
Psychologist said,
look,

857
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,970
I don't want to do this,
but I got to pull out of this fight.

858
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,500
I need some doc.
I need.

859
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:10,540
If you've got any doctors,
you can have an Mri,

860
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,383
me whatever you want,
but I'm telling you something's wrong 

861
00:40:12,551 --> 00:40:13,930
with my leg.
So he's like,

862
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,010
okay,
I'll do it.

863
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,030
I got,
I got guys on it.

864
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:17,950
We can have pulled out now.
I'm sure you're fine.

865
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,540
Check it out.
Get the doctors,

866
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,111
check it.
Yeah.

867
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,340
Your,
your quads torn.

868
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,830
You can't fight.
So the UFC pulls me,

869
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,780
you know,
Dane is naturally pissed,

870
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,810
but then that slide's a favor in their 
favor,

871
00:40:28,811 --> 00:40:32,080
gets the shot with,
with brow ends up getting knocked out in

872
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:32,914
that match up.

873
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,680
But um,
I pull out of that fight and that's when

874
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:36,514
they stripped my belt.
And then that was the beginning of me 

875
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:39,454
giving up on fighting to an extent.
And what I mean by that is it's 

876
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,200
different than you think.
It sounds negative,

877
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,034
right?
When you say that I'm giving up on 

878
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,413
fighting,
but it was actually the building point 

879
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,190
in my life where I finally let go of 
control.

880
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,090
I always had this thing up to that point
where I wanted to control everything.

881
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,273
It's just something that I,
I always had the gift of being able to 

882
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:07,921
do this last one after the two acl 
reconstructive surgeries coming back and

883
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:11,920
then tearing my quad after that.
I said like,

884
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,180
I don't know what else you want me to 
do.

885
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,550
I've gotten through two acl 
reconstructions.

886
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,080
Uh,
my higher power is God.

887
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,900
So I'm praying at this point saying,
I don't know what you want me to do.

888
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,940
So you're talking to God.
So yeah,

889
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,470
like what are we going to do?
What do I gotta do?

890
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:23,771
Man,
I'm,

891
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:25,530
do you want,
I'm,

892
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,760
I'm in this for,
for reasons bigger than myself.

893
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:31,090
I want to come back and show people that
this can be done.

894
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,350
I'm not the only one that can do this.
Anybody can do this,

895
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:34,184
right?
I'm here for you doing bidding your 

896
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:37,700
will.
God,

897
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,690
this is my talking and no answers,
no nothing.

898
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,110
And I said,
maybe that's the answer.

899
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,303
I remember thinking,
maybe that's the answer is just you 

900
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:50,510
might not ever fight again.
Are you okay with that?

901
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,793
And now something that I never allowed 
my brain to even go to ever until all 

902
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:59,660
these injuries hit me and I would've 
never been able to unless I went through

903
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:00,494
all that.
That was literally all this stuff 

904
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,014
because I'm so stubborn and so just 
tough that I had to go through all that 

905
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:09,140
just to mentally say,
okay,

906
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,580
you might never do this again.

907
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,160
It could have been after the first one.
I could've done that,

908
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,190
but I didn't.
When I did that,

909
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,070
my health skyrocketed.
Immediately.

910
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,023
I started.
I just went to therapy everyday knowing 

911
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,163
I was trying to get better,
but I didn't care if I fought again or 

912
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:25,394
not.
I focused all my energy and Fox and 

913
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:31,810
coaching the guys at Alliance Training 
Center to make them better and uh,

914
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,330
try to make the team better so that when
and,

915
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,183
and feed off the thirst and the hunger 
that those guys had to be the champion 

916
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:40,490
that I still wanted to be.
And I and I,

917
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,563
I decided that if I focused on Fox,
focused on the positive energy of these 

918
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:47,060
guys at the gym,
kept training.

919
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,600
I kept my mind in the sport.
I'm,

920
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:54,630
my body will be there because my age is 
compliant with my body still.

921
00:42:55,161 --> 00:42:56,960
I'm still young enough that I'll be 
okay.

922
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,220
So I just needed to get my mind wrapped 
around the sport,

923
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:01,054
stay in it mentally,
but understand that if I never have it 

924
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:04,100
again,
that's okay too.

925
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,443
And when I did that,
it took away so much importance off of 

926
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:12,320
needing to fight as have the title as 
my,

927
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,580
as the person that I was,
that it allowed me to open up and say,

928
00:43:15,581 --> 00:43:17,420
if you never fight again,
you're still a great person.

929
00:43:17,421 --> 00:43:18,254
You still did great things.
You still a laid the tracks for the 

930
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,510
Bantam Weight Division and a lot of 
ways,

931
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,860
um,
you did this,

932
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:28,940
that you had a great career dome.
Like it's okay if this is it.

933
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,033
And I kept that mindset kept focusing on
the things that I could control instead 

934
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:36,560
of the things that I couldn't,
like,

935
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,483
the fact that I wasn't competing yet.
And as I did that I got healthier and 

936
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:41,150
healthier.

937
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,983
Came back,
Ms Dot Docu that set me up to fight Ms 

938
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,203
Dot Jackie then destroyed ms dot Dr. One
of your best performances over first 

939
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:50,834
round destruction.
That was the most at peace of felt in a 

940
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,194
long time walking in.
I remember interviewing you after the 

941
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:58,040
fight and you were like,
I don't even remember what happened.

942
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,350
She just went like,
you went into a trance.

943
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,213
It was weird.
It was one of the weirdest performances 

944
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,154
in my whole career,
easily because the lockout was 

945
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,160
different.
Just I was so excited.

946
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,020
I had no,
no connection.

947
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,003
I was.
I had no connection to the win or the 

948
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,260
loss.
At that point.

949
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:16,573
There was nothing.
It was just I was just there to enjoy 

950
00:44:19,611 --> 00:44:20,444
being there again.
After three and a half years and all 

951
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:24,500
these injuries like I can't believe I 
made it here.

952
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,290
I'm not injured,
and I remember thinking like,

953
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,470
just you're in front of these people.

954
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,670
Enjoy the man.
Enjoy this ride.

955
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,504
Like this is incredible.
There's people that would pay millions 

956
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,384
and trillions of dollars to get this 
walk you're about to get and go fight 

957
00:44:38,281 --> 00:44:40,920
somebody this octagon.
Just enjoy it.

958
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,290
Don't worry,
don't connect and by letting go,

959
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,030
man,
by letting go of the injuries,

960
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:47,710
by letting go of the wind,
by letting go of the loss,

961
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:50,420
by letting go of either mattered.
I was in the.

962
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,930
I was in my zone and it allowed me to 
just be free and I was.

963
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:56,610
That was the best performance in my 
career,

964
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,743
but more than anything,
it showed me a mental thing that I'd 

965
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:01,224
never opened up before and it was 
letting go of the things that you can't 

966
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,144
control will give you actually more 
peace because it disconnects you from 

967
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,763
what happens,
so you feel like that piece was a 

968
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:16,404
significant factor in your body 
recovering because the pressure and the 

969
00:45:19,561 --> 00:45:23,550
stress and the anxiety,
all that was playing.

970
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,290
It was wrecking not just your mental 
state but also your physical state.

971
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,650
One hundred percent every piece of it.
That's really interesting.

972
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,693
Every piece of it,
and that's the biggest thing I learned 

973
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,650
is that is like it wasn't my physical 
body.

974
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,870
It was my mind doing it to my physical 
body.

975
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:40,823
So it was initially a physical injury 
and then it was the cascade of 

976
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,720
psychological issues that came with the 
physical issue,

977
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,033
some more physical issues.
It was the cascade of trying to figure 

978
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,144
out why I was so sad with all these 
things that I earned around me that I 

979
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:58,770
already had.
Everything that I thought,

980
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:02,580
like when you grow up in a trailer like 
I did,

981
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,300
and then you go to winning a Gtr,
that car you wanted since you were a kid

982
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,193
in a prize fight and having a home that 
you bought with your own money that you 

983
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:14,100
never thought you'd be able to own a 
home in California because you live in a

984
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:15,690
damn trailer park in Tucson,
Arizona.

985
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,110
It kinda like,
um,

986
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,980
makes you feel like,
like that's it,

987
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:23,691
you know,
like you,

988
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:24,524
you,
you've done crazy great things and 

989
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:28,960
you've um,
I,

990
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,280
those were all dreams to me and they 
happened so quick,

991
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,080
like at 20,
you know,

992
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,610
I mean,
I didn't get my house to later,

993
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:39,300
but when I got those things it's like,
why are you.

994
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:41,760
So I was still sad is my point.
Like I was still,

995
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,670
I had my depression that was hitting me.
And,

996
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:47,670
and that's so many people in this world 
are dealing with depression.

997
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,330
Like it's a huge catastrophic problem 
across the planet.

998
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:54,930
And um,
I definitely,

999
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,730
it's in my,
it's in my blood line,

1000
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:59,520
on both sides of my family and it's 
something that everybody,

1001
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,770
not just myself deals with on a daily 
basis,

1002
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:02,604
I think in certain people's lives.
And that hit me very hard and I didn't 

1003
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:10,050
understand why it hit me so much harder 
now after I stopped competing.

1004
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,730
Like why am I,
why is,

1005
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,593
why is it so much worse now?
While the reason is my body was used to 

1006
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:18,780
the active,
the activity just go,

1007
00:47:18,781 --> 00:47:19,590
go,
go.

1008
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:20,423
And I,
what I realized is I turned off all my 

1009
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:23,244
emotional,
spiritual and mental issues with 

1010
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:29,010
exercise to where I never ever,
ever dealt with them ever.

1011
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,020
I only physically worked them out.
So my physical was perfection.

1012
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,240
I was a,
I'm a world champion,

1013
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:39,220
monster,
killer,

1014
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:42,190
whatever you want to call me in your own
respective mind,

1015
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:44,470
right?
But emotionally,

1016
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,333
physically and spiritually.
I was at cricket and I'd never 

1017
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:52,390
understood that until I was hurt,
trapped in my own body.

1018
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:54,760
Like a prison cell,
couldn't train,

1019
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,020
couldn't run,
couldn't walk,

1020
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:59,110
couldn't bend my leg,
laying on the couch,

1021
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,910
eating pain pills,
realizing,

1022
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,740
man,
unless you train,

1023
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:04,480
unless you compete,
you hate yourself,

1024
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:06,320
you hate yourself,
you're,

1025
00:48:06,321 --> 00:48:09,310
you're a piece of shit in your own mind 
without those things,

1026
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,430
without the beautiful girlfriend,
without the beautiful house,

1027
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,264
without the Nice cars,
without them big money to show people 

1028
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:17,050
you hate yourself.

1029
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,920
So what am I really doing?
Why am I doing this?

1030
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,310
I lost sight that the whole reason we're
fighting is,

1031
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,470
is it's a spiritual,
emotional,

1032
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:27,304
physical,
mental battle that helps you grow as an 

1033
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:29,884
individual and as a human being.
It's not just to have these things that 

1034
00:48:32,471 --> 00:48:33,304
you think will make you happy.
You have to learn those things through 

1035
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:36,634
the process.
And I didn't know that until I was 

1036
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:39,454
trapped in my own body and I literally 
felt like I was in a prison cell and I 

1037
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:42,724
knew that wasn't right.
We shouldn't be in our own body alone 

1038
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,243
without people around us to keep us 
company and a on a couch feeling like 

1039
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:54,370
we're in a prison cell,
should we?

1040
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:55,960
No,
definitely not.

1041
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,650
No,
we shouldn't,

1042
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,460
but I did for three years.
So how did you get yourself out of it by

1043
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,260
just accepting it and you must.

1044
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,730
There must've been some sort of a 
mechanism that caused.

1045
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:08,200
I have people that I talked to,
professionals,

1046
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:09,703
um,
obviously like sports psychologists or 

1047
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,823
sports psychologist,
and then you got to get a psychologist 

1048
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:16,810
in general to deal with the depression,
whatever.

1049
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:19,290
When you hit your lows,
like it's okay to,

1050
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,410
to get,
you know,

1051
00:49:20,411 --> 00:49:24,370
if you're bench pressing 350 pounds,
it's okay to have a little touch.

1052
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,080
It's okay to have a little spot here and
there,

1053
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:26,914
you know,
and then after you get a couple of 

1054
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,730
spots,
now after awhile you can do it yourself.

1055
00:49:30,731 --> 00:49:34,240
You don't need the spot anymore.
That's how I look at psychiatric help to

1056
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,320
an extent.
For some people,

1057
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:36,790
especially if they're battling 
depression.

1058
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,833
Sometimes you just need a floaty and you
did and then you can take the floaties 

1059
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,520
off after a year.
See what I'm saying?

1060
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,354
It's a mental,
it's a mental floaty and it's okay 

1061
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:50,200
because we all hit low part low points 
in our life where it's unbearable.

1062
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,590
And you either allow it to continue to 
be unbearable and just deny it,

1063
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,620
or you deal with the task at hand and 
say,

1064
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:57,390
I'm a little low right now.
I need the floaties.

1065
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,350
It's okay,
I'll get through this.

1066
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,393
And then when you take the is off,
you realize I only needed them for a 

1067
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,540
little bit of time and now I'm okay.
I'm here.

1068
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,673
And that's Kinda what it felt like.
It's like I just needed a little bit of 

1069
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:08,974
a push.
I needed to get through this and learn 

1070
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:11,434
some things about my own,
my own mind and understand my own 

1071
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,603
emotions and understand that I didn't 
need all these things that I was 

1072
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:21,340
thinking where it real.
It was me not being in control of my own

1073
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:23,710
emotions,
your own emotions or your choice.

1074
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,040
And I chose to feel trapped.
I chose to be sad.

1075
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:29,210
I chose to feel like I was Jack Shit.

1076
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,043
I chose all these things and it's like 
you don't need fighting to be these 

1077
00:50:32,931 --> 00:50:33,764
things.
You need to.

1078
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:37,040
You need to let go of fighting to learn 
that you are something without it.

1079
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:38,713
And that was actually a gift.
It became a gift because I learned so 

1080
00:50:42,321 --> 00:50:47,270
much in life now bigger than fighting.
I look at the things that I went through

1081
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:52,271
as a gift because I have gotten the gift
of feeling retired during my career.

1082
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:00,800
Who else gets that?
Some people retire for five years,

1083
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:01,634
lose their freaking mind,
end up in the bar and come back and try 

1084
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:05,960
to fight again.
Ten years later with a weakened body,

1085
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,390
a mess or abuse.
Why?

1086
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,493
Why?
Though?

1087
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:10,573
Why are they doing that?
They're not doing it because they're 

1088
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:12,374
physically capable.
They're doing it because they never 

1089
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:15,470
dealt with their life away from 
fighting.

1090
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,660
Fighting was there like fighting is who 
they are.

1091
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,660
Fighting is their persona.
So takeaway fighting.

1092
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,020
What are they?
They're in the bar drinking away with.

1093
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:26,690
They're not.
Instead of drinking,

1094
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:29,690
putting the booze down and knowing what 
you are without fighting,

1095
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,350
being happy with that chapter of your 
life and being able to live who you are.

1096
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,184
I've gotten to feel that and now I can 
fight with a peace of mind knowing how 

1097
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:42,110
good I am without fighting and how great
I am with it too.

1098
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,800
And um,
that's,

1099
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,220
that's what this thing's about.
All these fights,

1100
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:50,054
all these me attacking those challenges 
coming back and winning and getting my 

1101
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:54,040
belt back.
Um,

1102
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,233
that could only happen because I let go 
of control of the things I couldn't 

1103
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:01,280
control.
So you come back,

1104
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,330
you fight,
Mitsui,

1105
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,163
rocky,
you put on the performance of your 

1106
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:05,330
career,
just destroyed him.

1107
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,280
It was just a whirlwind,
wild,

1108
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,500
crazy first round stoppage.

1109
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,640
Then what happens?
Well,

1110
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,493
that was,
that was a big deal for me because he'd 

1111
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:20,060
never been stopped like that before.
Ms Dot Jackie at this point,

1112
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,670
at this point,
he was on a five fight win streak.

1113
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:26,600
He hadn't lost since the whole time I 
had been hurt and he was,

1114
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,613
he was beating the top guys.
So to beat him was going to tell me 

1115
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:32,120
you're good enough,
let's go for the title.

1116
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,470
And I beat him.
And I said,

1117
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:34,400
okay,
here I am.

1118
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,010
Let's go for that title.
And at this point,

1119
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,133
if you remember,
it was Barao was the next coming to 

1120
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:44,690
Christ.
And then Tj beat the brakes off of them.

1121
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,850
And now Tj is the next company,
crises,

1122
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:48,230
a better version of me.
He's this,

1123
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,840
he's that.
And so I said,

1124
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:51,591
yeah,
I can be him.

1125
00:52:51,591 --> 00:52:53,390
I knew I could.
I'd been watching him on,

1126
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,313
on film and for Fox and breaking down 
his fights and I knew I could beat 

1127
00:52:58,071 --> 00:52:58,670
Barao.

1128
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,790
I knew both those guys couldn't beat me 
at that point,

1129
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,103
but it didn't matter what I thought I 
had to prove it and nobody's going to 

1130
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:09,920
believe you after for injuries the way I
had them.

1131
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:10,754
So I just had to go do it.
I blew my knee out training one month 

1132
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,330
after I fought to Chi Mizzou.
Gawky.

1133
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:21,650
Now this is what's interesting about the
story is I did research later.

1134
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,800
I'm now basically a doctor to figure all
this stuff because all the injuries I've

1135
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,620
been through,
but three weeks before I fought ms dot,

1136
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,780
I had a staph infection in my right 
thumb that popped up.

1137
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,823
So I took a um,
antibiotic called Cipro as I think it's 

1138
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:41,841
with the CIP pro.
Now me trusting the doctors and me not,

1139
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,380
it's my own fault.
Not the doctor's fault.

1140
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:50,460
I should have read what was the hazards 
of the antibiotic,

1141
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,680
but you,
you kind of trust the doctors and assume

1142
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,150
why would he give me something bad?

1143
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,983
Right.
Well,

1144
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:59,990
Cipro has an after effect for six months
after you ingest it that it weakens your

1145
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:03,960
attendance so it makes them soft,
like real puddy.

1146
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,050
And so I took it three weeks before the 
fight.

1147
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,650
That made it.
About two months after I ingested the,

1148
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:14,550
the Cipro,
I was throwing a left high kick.

1149
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,340
I'd never had a problem with my right 
knee,

1150
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,560
my entire life ever,
and it just popped,

1151
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:20,394
throwing a right high kick.
I pivot on my right leg to throw the 

1152
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:23,754
left,
went up high and it just popped and I 

1153
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:28,830
knew right away obviously because I've 
done two,

1154
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,693
done it twice,
that I blew it out and I remember 

1155
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,394
literally blowing it out,
sitting on the floor of the guy that I 

1156
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:35,790
was driven with his like,
what's up?

1157
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,570
And I was like,
ah,

1158
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,830
my knee.
I just blew my knee out.

1159
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:38,880
And he's like,
what?

1160
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,713
You just,
you?

1161
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,480
Nothing happened.
Like it was crazy.

1162
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,800
It was crazy.
It was.

1163
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:44,693
It was a weird feeling and what was even
weirder was the piece I had sitting 

1164
00:54:50,191 --> 00:54:51,870
there,
not even carry.

1165
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,130
I literally was just.
I remember blowing it out and sitting on

1166
00:54:56,131 --> 00:54:59,040
the ring.
Like I told her,

1167
00:54:59,070 --> 00:54:59,641
I said,
Eric,

1168
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:00,474
come here,
and I told him to come over and I was 

1169
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:03,060
like,
you ready for another nine months?

1170
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:05,610
ACL reconstructive surgery.
And he's like,

1171
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:06,391
what?
He's like,

1172
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:07,840
what are you talking about?
Your needs fine,

1173
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:08,451
you need.
I'm like,

1174
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:09,031
no,
it's blew.

1175
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:10,200
I blew it out right now.
He's like,

1176
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:10,711
no,
you didn't.

1177
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:11,101
I said,
yes,

1178
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,290
I did.
And that was it.

1179
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,140
And so I start again.
Start again.

1180
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:16,974
So I started the Rehab,
same style of a reconstruction this 

1181
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:20,904
times better because I had the first two
practice tries and now I had the secret 

1182
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:27,240
link.

1183
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,910
What's the secret link that I didn't 
know for the first three injuries that I

1184
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:34,230
had was letting go of control.
This was the,

1185
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,093
this was my diamond,
this was to now I had a way to prove 

1186
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:38,814
that I was onto something in my own mind
and I did it and I was onto something 

1187
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:46,260
and I know it now and nobody can ever 
tell me anything different.

1188
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,600
It was.
It was just.

1189
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:50,970
I stopped right then and there.
The day I blew my knee out.

1190
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,080
I didn't train again for nine months 
other than physical therapy.

1191
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:57,300
I didn't.
I didn't shadow box,

1192
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,610
I didn't do a pushup.
I didn't do a setup.

1193
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:01,990
I didn't do a squat.
I didn't.

1194
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:02,903
I went in the gym occasionally,
but because I had learned to let go of 

1195
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:10,440
fighting from the first two injuries,
I didn't go in there panicking,

1196
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:13,290
trying to keep training because I needed
it for my health anymore.

1197
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,543
I already learned that,
that the way I find health is to not 

1198
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,890
train.
Let my body completely healed,

1199
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:20,724
don't do anything and focus on my mind.
So I spent another nine months focusing 

1200
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,630
on nothing but my mind and my tactic 
was,

1201
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,823
your body's not working right now,
so you've got to switch it over to the 

1202
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:32,770
next weapon.
That you have,

1203
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,880
which is your mind,
your will,

1204
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:37,270
your mind is the only other weapon you 
use besides your body on fight night.

1205
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:38,980
So if your body's not working,
switch it over.

1206
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:42,370
So I just focused on my mind and by 
focusing on my mind,

1207
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,204
I'm talking.
I started looking up guys like Wayne 

1208
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:46,263
Dyer.
Um,

1209
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:49,500
I started talking to a guy named Mike 
Michael Jordan,

1210
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,000
Michael t larden,
Dr Mark Michael,

1211
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:55,510
t dot larden.
I started putting in place specific,

1212
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,790
uh,
go to people for my,

1213
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,930
for my,
uh,

1214
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:02,110
to talk to that.
I looked up to a power people,

1215
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:03,070
I guess you'd put them right.

1216
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm sure you have some too.
And I focused on nothing but my mind,

1217
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:09,840
I didn't train at all.
And um,

1218
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,630
I remember I got a call.
I was out at the lake in Arizona.

1219
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:18,070
I literally hit the nine month mark on 
this weekend.

1220
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,850
I get a call from shelby to nine month 
mark.

1221
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:25,120
They knew my knee was going to be old 
and he goes,

1222
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,063
you're healthy,
right?

1223
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:27,701
And I was like,
well,

1224
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:29,830
I've done nothing but rehab it.
It's been nine months.

1225
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:31,960
So technically I'm cleared by the 
doctor,

1226
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:32,794
they know I'm cleared by the doctor 
because the UFC talks with the doctors 

1227
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,210
24 slash seven,
whether they admit it or not.

1228
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:38,343
So it's like even if the doctor 
shouldn't tell the UFC there telling 

1229
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:41,344
them everything so they know exactly 
where I'm at in Rehab exactly where I'm 

1230
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:45,184
at in therapy to the tee and that's why 
they know when to call me and put the 

1231
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:49,234
heat on me.

1232
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,640
So I'm out on the boat drinking some 
beers,

1233
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:55,990
trying to enjoy my life and I get a call
we can get you.

1234
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,853
We want to give you a title fight with 
Tj dillashaw in the beginning of the 

1235
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:00,923
year,
whatever.

1236
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:05,290
At that point I had 12 weeks when they 
called me to get ready for the fight.

1237
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,500
So three months but zero training for 
nine months.

1238
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,650
Correct.
Wow.

1239
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,680
After the misery gawky fight,
that's,

1240
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,633
that's insane.
Just to be able to get yourself into 

1241
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,310
five round performance.
Correct?

1242
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,740
Correct.
And this is,

1243
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,873
I mean,
you're hearing a story right now and I 

1244
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:20,434
haven't told anybody because I don't sit
down and talk for two hours to anybody 

1245
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:28,180
about this stuff,
so it's like,

1246
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:29,014
who would I,
who am I going to go on an interview 

1247
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,830
with and talk about this stuff?
Pretty much you're the only guy who gets

1248
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,640
into this weird stuff.

1249
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,640
So here we are and all it comes down to 
that like,

1250
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,530
yeah,
I was on zero.

1251
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:42,483
And I said again,
because of what I learned with the MS 

1252
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,420
dot docket thing,
letting go.

1253
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,400
I just kept exercising that because 
what's gonna happen is gonna happen.

1254
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:53,560
It's out of my control.
God's God has planned for me.

1255
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,890
He took me this far in my mind.
That's my higher power.

1256
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,903
And remember,
if you're listening and your higher 

1257
00:58:59,591 --> 00:59:01,930
power is not God,
it can be whatever you want it to be for

1258
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:02,764
your higher power,
like that matter of just letting a 

1259
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,660
matter of just letting go and 
understanding that there's,

1260
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,800
there's something in effect that's 
bigger than you hear in the universe and

1261
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,283
as soon as you can do that,
you're going to be who you're going to 

1262
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:17,680
be.
And then when you,

1263
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,500
when you are who you are because you're 
not worried about all these other things

1264
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,340
connected to it,
you get your,

1265
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:23,450
your fullest self.

1266
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,003
And in being that,
it allowed me to get ready for Tj 

1267
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:30,470
because I wasn't thinking about.
He's been fighting.

1268
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,150
You haven't,
he's been this,

1269
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:35,690
you haven't that I'm,
none of that mattered.

1270
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:37,610
It wasn't relevant because I was 
fighting him no matter what.

1271
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:38,863
So I just let go and said getting a tip 
top shape you can with the tools you 

1272
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:44,330
have and let's go fight him.
You know,

1273
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,440
you have the skillset,
you know,

1274
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:46,274
you have the knowledge and the movement 
and you're young enough and your body's 

1275
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,703
working.
You just proved that with ms dot 

1276
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,133
[inaudible].
So you just got to get in shape and 

1277
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:54,170
you're fine.
And that was literally my mindset.

1278
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:57,650
Well,
uh,

1279
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,060
at that eight week mark,
so it saw at 12 weeks I start training.

1280
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,390
So that's 12 weeks out,
12 weeks out I start,

1281
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,643
I stopped just physical therapy,
which I was doing three times a week 

1282
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:13,550
only and I go to flight training.

1283
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,930
I start my,
my,

1284
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,410
just my regimen,
what I do for each camp in doing that,

1285
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,830
going from off the couch,
doing nothing straight into a five round

1286
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:23,650
title fight.
Um,

1287
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,470
I learned that actually sparked what I 
had now have,

1288
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:29,750
which is plantar Fascia tendonitis in 
my,

1289
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,584
both my feet.
And so it's because going from resting 

1290
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,100
for a year,
whatever,

1291
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:36,680
three years,
and then going full bore on your feet,

1292
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:37,783
it tore all the Fascia on the bottom of 
my feet because they weren't ready for 

1293
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:40,664
the brunt of forest that I was putting 
on him when my footwork and my movement 

1294
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,460
and my sparring and my kickboxing and 
all that,

1295
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:47,294
it wasn't ready.
So I tore all the Fascia on the bottom 

1296
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,124
of my feet.
So I started feeling something weird on 

1297
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:54,320
the bottom of my left foot in that camp 
simultaneously at the,

1298
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,590
at the eight week mark,
after I had been training for 12,

1299
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:58,723
what?

1300
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,150
Four weeks I've been training for the TJ
dillashaw camp.

1301
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,150
I broke my rib so I get kicked in my 
rib.

1302
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,103
My Body's just soft.
I hadn't been getting kicked or punched 

1303
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,450
in over for three and a half years now 
because if you think about it,

1304
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:18,800
ms dot occupied doesn't even count so 
fast and he didn't even hit you.

1305
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:22,580
He didn't hit me.
He hit me one time and it was just under

1306
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:23,414
a minute long fight.
And so the only wear and tear and and 

1307
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:28,543
Callus for lack of a better term I have 
on my body is from the training camp 

1308
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,230
before Ms With Aki,
which was only a three round camp.

1309
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,620
So I have no wear and tear on my body,
no toughness.

1310
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:42,350
He kicked my rib,
breaks my rib,

1311
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:43,543
I lose right then and there.
I can't wrestle anymore and I can't 

1312
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:47,234
speak anymore.
So now I'm at eight weeks out of the 

1313
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:49,304
flight and they take away my sparring 
and they take away my wrestling because 

1314
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:52,514
I can't go live.

1315
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,443
So I'm just drilling kickboxing now.
Pad work with coach Eric dolphy around 

1316
01:01:57,211 --> 01:02:02,211
Miguel Ras and grappling a drills.
So you taping up your rib now?

1317
01:02:03,521 --> 01:02:06,920
I get this big a thing that goes over 
the top.

1318
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:09,740
It's like this weird protector and I 
wear that.

1319
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,820
Is it a protector against impact or 
protect our.

1320
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,500
Does it actually like a cast that holds 
your ribs in place or.

1321
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,483
No,
it was like I had to look it up online 

1322
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:20,940
myself or some makeshift thing that 
would work in this thing.

1323
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,500
Work the best.
I forget what it's called.

1324
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:26,010
I can text it to you and figure it out.
But it's like a picture,

1325
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:27,720
like what you were,
what the,

1326
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,280
what the coaches were when they were 
that body plane.

1327
01:02:30,281 --> 01:02:32,550
He can punch in the body and it goes all
the way up to here.

1328
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,140
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1329
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,950
It's like one of those but it's a little
smaller and it just goes here.

1330
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,880
And then you,
uh,

1331
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,240
you put it on like a shirt and it 
crosses and the cables,

1332
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,220
crocs crossing the back and then the 
whole front is kind like,

1333
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,073
squishy,
but protecting you from squeezing and 

1334
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,400
blunt force.
But I wasn't taking any anyways.

1335
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:54,360
I was just wearing that for when I would
drill.

1336
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,960
I wasn't gone live yet.
So then I finally start panicking when I

1337
01:03:00,001 --> 01:03:04,560
can't,
I can't spar or wrestle alive after four

1338
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:06,030
weeks with a busted rib,
I was like,

1339
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:06,811
oh,
it'll go away.

1340
01:03:06,811 --> 01:03:09,420
It just wasn't going away.
It was just killing me.

1341
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,170
I couldn't even breathe,
man.

1342
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,870
I couldn't sneeze.
I couldn't cough.

1343
01:03:12,871 --> 01:03:13,704
It was horrible.
So I just said I got to shoot a 

1344
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,200
cortisone and see if that helps.
So I go in,

1345
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:21,210
see the doctor,
they shoot a cortisone.

1346
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,890
Thank God it worked and numbed it within
three days a moving again,

1347
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:26,724
I'm good.
So the reason I didn't shoot it right 

1348
01:03:28,381 --> 01:03:29,214
away is because you want to give it as 
much time as you can to heal before you 

1349
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:32,154
shoot it,
to see if you can minimize the damage 

1350
01:03:33,721 --> 01:03:36,060
that you do with the cortisone.
So that makes sense.

1351
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:38,230
That's why I didn't do it right on.
Does damage it.

1352
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:41,850
It breaks down tissue like muscle and 
tendon tissue.

1353
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,820
If you overdo it,
you can do within three and one injected

1354
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,620
area,
but you don't want to do more than three

1355
01:03:47,621 --> 01:03:48,990
in one area depending on where you're 
at.

1356
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,824
Okay.
This is my first one in this particular 

1357
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:52,740
rib.
I mean I've had them all over my body,

1358
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:53,810
but this,
in this rip,

1359
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,030
when that kicks in,
I'm like,

1360
01:03:57,031 --> 01:03:58,830
sweet.
I can spar and I can wrestle now.

1361
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:01,140
I just got to wear that thing.
So the whole camp,

1362
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:05,670
I'm wearing this thing and uh,
I can't do any core workout.

1363
01:04:05,671 --> 01:04:10,530
I can't do any strength and conditioning
at all because we had to ditch those two

1364
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:11,364
things in order to focus on cardio and 
skill because we had to get my cardio 

1365
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:15,594
and skill back in my timing and my reads
back more than I needed strength and 

1366
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:22,950
conditioning.
So because I'm coming back from so much,

1367
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,813
you actually have to just cut out what's
not needed in the cans that you've had 

1368
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:27,504
in the past and take what you can use.
So what are you doing for cardios own 

1369
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,053
makeshift?
I have a sprint routine that I run that 

1370
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:37,400
solely mine that I got from a guy named 
drew fickett way back in the day.

1371
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,310
I know drew.
Oh yeah,

1372
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:39,930
you did.
As my first MMA coach.

1373
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,690
Dude,
he's a nasty,

1374
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,860
crazy,
dirty,

1375
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:44,694
filthy son of a gun.
I'll just leave it at that Heaven Don 

1376
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,920
Frye.
I started out with two of them,

1377
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:51,923
first MMA coach,
just to give you an idea of when I 

1378
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,000
started and they weren't even my coaches
because if you know them,

1379
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:57,834
they don't coach anybody.
They just yell at you slurs and then 

1380
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:00,894
maybe put you to sleep a couple of times
and Don Frye throws head kicks when 

1381
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:07,470
you're only supposed to be boxing.
So it's like they're not real coaches,

1382
01:05:07,471 --> 01:05:09,270
they're just showing you how to be a 
maniac.

1383
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,120
But anyways,
he shows me this sprint routine,

1384
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,440
which I still use to this day.
So true.

1385
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,283
Fake.
It's the man.

1386
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:20,170
I'm so and but you're still dealing with
plantar fasciitis now.

1387
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,480
Well then it starts kicking in because 
of the sprinting,

1388
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,070
sprinting,
footwork,

1389
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,820
everything else coming from nothing.
But it's only in my left foot,

1390
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:29,380
so I think I kicked an elbow.

1391
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,640
I Dunno a habit yet,
so I don't go get an Mri.

1392
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,474
I don't check anything.
I just ignore it because I'm fighting 

1393
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:37,450
either way.
I don't want to know.

1394
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,570
Sometimes it's just better not knowing,
you know,

1395
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,470
especially if you're gonna fight,
whether it's hard or not.

1396
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:42,693
So I just said screw it.
I didn't shoot it up with cortisone or 

1397
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,610
nothing.
I just ignored it.

1398
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:49,870
Kept running super painful.
If you've ever had it.

1399
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,420
Plantar Fasciitis,
it's debilitating to an extent.

1400
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,190
But um,
you know,

1401
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:59,191
thank God it was only in one foot and 
then I go into that fight with about.

1402
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:04,120
I had about a good solid four week camp 
of sparring in wrestling thing,

1403
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:05,860
god of live stuff.
But other than that,

1404
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:09,640
the first 12 weeks was basically just 
getting into shape.

1405
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,380
So my whole camp was comprised of mostly
sprints,

1406
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:19,150
pad work in about a month of sparring.
And I lost almost all rounds coming back

1407
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:24,100
because I was just so off from the year 
and the not doing anything in my body,

1408
01:06:24,101 --> 01:06:26,980
not being strong and trying to get back 
in shape.

1409
01:06:27,010 --> 01:06:27,843
And it was tough.
It was by far that camp was the worst 

1410
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,430
put together.
Most off in horrible camp.

1411
01:06:36,431 --> 01:06:40,700
I've had in my whole 24 fights by far.
You won the title and I.

1412
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,330
Yeah,
some thing.

1413
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,770
The good Lord above.
I won that title that that's how I,

1414
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,710
that's,
that's it didn't really make sense.

1415
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:50,950
But it happened and we didn't know that 
you had plantar fasciitis.

1416
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:54,430
So when you kept getting hit by leg 
kicks and your leg was giving out,

1417
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:57,520
I was thinking that your leg was giving 
out from the impact.

1418
01:06:57,521 --> 01:06:58,780
And I,
and I don't take,

1419
01:06:59,230 --> 01:07:00,500
you know,
it's hard as a.

1420
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:04,360
especially I do it with you color now.
It's hard,

1421
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:05,650
man.
This thing's hard.

1422
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:07,300
Somebody's going to get mad no matter 
what you do,

1423
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:09,880
no matter what you say eventually.
And it's like,

1424
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:10,714
how are you supposed to know?
My Foot's blown out before I get in 

1425
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:12,760
there.

1426
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,830
Well,
now I saw you in the,

1427
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:16,360
uh,
uriah faber fight,

1428
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:17,194
which happened after that,
and then I noticed your foot was taped 

1429
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:19,294
up.
Both.

1430
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:22,360
Yes,
it went into the other foot as well.

1431
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:26,800
And then the cody fight it multiplied by
two in both feet.

1432
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:29,530
So instead of just having it in one for 
Tj,

1433
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,780
I get through.
Then I have it in both.

1434
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:35,110
It just started my other foot for favor.
And then by the,

1435
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,910
by the,
by the cody fight,

1436
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:39,100
it was just,
it's been out of control.

1437
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,320
I had done a three camps and I had done 
a year,

1438
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,340
a year of nonstop work after that,
after that year off.

1439
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:46,810
And what can you.
No excuses.

1440
01:07:46,811 --> 01:07:48,790
I want to go ahead and make this this 
point right now.

1441
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:50,380
There's no excuses for that.
Um,

1442
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:55,740
I did pretty good at wrapping it.
I shot botox in the bottom of both of my

1443
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:56,320
feet.

1444
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,153
Botox,
it was the worst thing I've ever gone 

1445
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:00,130
through.
Why does Botox,

1446
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:02,770
what does that do for the,
the idea with botox as it was a,

1447
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:03,604
it was an off the wall method because 
there's no cure for plantar fascia 

1448
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:08,590
tendons.
You just improvise this?

1449
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,310
Yes,
because I was,

1450
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:11,290
well,
I heard it from other doctors.

1451
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,124
It's an underground method.
It's like I was just willing to do 

1452
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:15,410
anything.
Joe,

1453
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,730
like I was in so much pain,
dude.

1454
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:17,564
I couldn't.
I'd wake up in the morning and I'd have 

1455
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:20,474
to go on my hands and knees to the 
bathtub so I wouldn't put weight on my 

1456
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:24,074
feet.
I'm not kidding.

1457
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,300
So I wouldn't put up during fight camp.
Oh yeah.

1458
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,660
So I wouldn't put weight on my feet 
because they're are too cold,

1459
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,550
so it's like needles,
you know,

1460
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,800
so you have to warm them up first.
So.

1461
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,960
So that the fasciitis doesn't get worse.

1462
01:08:36,260 --> 01:08:41,260
So I fill up a tub with hot water and 
Epson salt and then I,

1463
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:44,303
I filled that out.
I had to fill that out by going on my 

1464
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:47,870
hands and knees because you don't want 
to put weight on it early.

1465
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:51,770
This is a method I heard from a runner 
that he used in order to heal his.

1466
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:55,190
And so I tried it for about a month.
I was going,

1467
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:57,830
I would fill it up and then I soak my 
feet every morning.

1468
01:08:57,831 --> 01:08:58,664
Then after I sold them,
I have a tape routine that I have on 

1469
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:02,060
both my feet at tape,
both my feet,

1470
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:02,894
like you would picture taping your hands
and then I wear my shoes and I warm up 

1471
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:11,060
my feet before I get there at the gym 
and then I'd go,

1472
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,630
um,
but that was for all three of the fights

1473
01:09:14,631 --> 01:09:15,464
this last year I've had to deal with 
that and I actually did a really good 

1474
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,064
job minimizing the pain and the botox 
first I shot cortisone in them and that 

1475
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,070
didn't help and numbed it a little bit,
but it didn't help.

1476
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,400
I shot it after when I fought Tj and I 
was getting kicked in the leg,

1477
01:09:28,401 --> 01:09:29,320
like you say,
and I was,

1478
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:30,883
that was my foot being toward like the 
Fascia actually completely tore off the 

1479
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:36,110
heel in that fight.
That hurt that I felt.

1480
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:39,950
I've never felt anything really in a 
fight that I felt when it popped.

1481
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,810
And that's how I knew I was,
like I said,

1482
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:42,644
I was like,
I think my foot's tour and a half or 

1483
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:45,920
something because it just,
I felt it when it,

1484
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:46,873
when it popped open in that fifth round 
and I had about four minutes left 

1485
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,260
around,
I remember like,

1486
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:52,290
Oh shit,
you better,

1487
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,980
you better figure something out.
And then,

1488
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,053
you know,
you could tell I was staying a little 

1489
01:09:56,661 --> 01:09:59,320
bit more stationary I think.
And that's why the kickstart to land.

1490
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,900
But um,
so it goes,

1491
01:10:01,901 --> 01:10:02,990
man,
we're in the fight business.

1492
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,900
All of us go in there with injuries.
I'm not making excuses,

1493
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,430
but people want to know,
you know,

1494
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:09,070
injuries.
We all go in there in jail.

1495
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,240
I'm not like almost all of us to 
something.

1496
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:16,720
And a lot of high level like marathon 
runners deal with this foot problem that

1497
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:19,820
I have and they run marathons with this 
so it can be done.

1498
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,610
But it's just an extra hindrance.
It's very difficult.

1499
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:25,640
And going barefoot with it is,
is the hardest part.

1500
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,021
That's true,
right?

1501
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:28,810
Because at least marathon runners,
some wear shoe.

1502
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:31,370
And that helps because I have orthotics 
in there.

1503
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,130
Supports you can put that,
keep the support,

1504
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:37,820
but I have a high arch and so what that 
means is the arch,

1505
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,893
there's a Fascia that hold everything in
place and the art starts to fail and 

1506
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,984
that's what that needle feelings.
It's like it's the Fascia on the bottom 

1507
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:47,390
of your foot because I'm always on my 
toes.

1508
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:48,553
It just,
it wasn't ready for the brunt from zero 

1509
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:53,510
to hero run and it kind of put a bunch 
of lesions in it.

1510
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:55,160
And now how do you heal those?
Now?

1511
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:58,070
Can you tape it with an orthotic 
underneath?

1512
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,053
No,
because I mean then you have orthotics 

1513
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:02,060
tucked to the bottom of your feet.
You're hopping around.

1514
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,400
You basically just training.
Can I just take my.

1515
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,260
Well,
I wear my wrestling shoes and I taped my

1516
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:07,094
feet,
taped my feet and were wrestling shoes 

1517
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:09,980
with my,
with my,

1518
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:10,910
uh,
supports in there.

1519
01:11:10,911 --> 01:11:14,130
And what,
what methods of healing

1520
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:17,610
can they sort of use?
There isn't any.

1521
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,150
Now this is why I use both stem cells.
Uh,

1522
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:25,430
I was actually thinking of getting some 
stem cells put in my elbows,

1523
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,220
my shoulders and my knees coming up.
But for my feet,

1524
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,670
prp and stem cell is all just,
it's all just.

1525
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,710
Sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

1526
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,800
Anything you look at,
if you google plan to.

1527
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:40,080
They have no cure for it.
It's,

1528
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,690
it's a,
it's a worldwide problem that there's no

1529
01:11:42,691 --> 01:11:43,524
cure for it.
And where are you going to get the stem 

1530
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:46,560
cell stuff done?
Um,

1531
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,210
well I've only talked to people about 
it,

1532
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:50,720
but I'd be more than happy to care with 
you on.

1533
01:11:50,721 --> 01:11:53,250
I'm sure he has some hookups because I 
need the best in the world out.

1534
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,950
There's a guy in Vegas,
Dr Rodney Mcgee.

1535
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,760
He's heard of a.
he's worked with a lot.

1536
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,770
Daniel.
He's worked with people before Cormier,

1537
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,680
Cormier,
this guy does he.

1538
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:04,583
Well,
there's a bunch of different ways to do 

1539
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:05,844
it.
[inaudible] guy went into his hip and 

1540
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:09,620
they pulled a bone marrow out of his hip
and they,

1541
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:13,620
it's super painful and then they get 
your own stem cells from that.

1542
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,640
The way the guy in Vegas does it,
they're taking the stem cells.

1543
01:12:17,641 --> 01:12:18,474
When a woman has a Cesarean section,
when she gives birth through Sicilian 

1544
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,980
section,
they take away the placenta.

1545
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:23,993
They usually would just throw it out,
but they can take that placenta and 

1546
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:26,754
extract stem cells from it.
I'd rather have that than some of the 

1547
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:29,454
dcs,
but you don't want them digging in your 

1548
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,550
going.
It's super painful on your hip too.

1549
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,543
Yeah,
he was talking about how he was limping 

1550
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:38,270
for a couple of weeks.
He's big boned though.

1551
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:40,980
Yeah,
he's a big fellow,

1552
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:42,750
but he sees this.
He's.

1553
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,050
You know,
it's interesting.

1554
01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:44,884
Like somebody said to me once a day,
she should be fight in middleweight and 

1555
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,110
go stand next to them and say that his.

1556
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,130
He's like this.
Yeah,

1557
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:53,300
he's a tank.
He's a big dude.

1558
01:12:53,301 --> 01:12:54,360
Yeah.
He might only be five,

1559
01:12:54,361 --> 01:12:55,194
10 Chubby,
but he's stronger than anybody can 

1560
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,410
imagine.
You don't pick up Dan Henderson.

1561
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,244
How about Josh Barnett?
Remember when he was fighting a 

1562
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:04,874
heavyweight and strikeforce.
He picked up Josh Barnett like it was a 

1563
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:07,824
pillow and slammed them on the ground.
I mean like the guy like blows my mind 

1564
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,710
how good he is.
Phenomenal wrestling enough credit.

1565
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,053
I know DC on a training level.
When I watch him train on a personal 

1566
01:13:20,701 --> 01:13:21,660
level,
I mean,

1567
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,930
he's crazy.
He's always talking out of his butt,

1568
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:25,890
you know,
to an extent.

1569
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:27,990
It's hilarious.
But uh,

1570
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,960
he's a beast man.
He's got to respect that.

1571
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:31,950
Yeah,
I'd love that guy.

1572
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:33,690
He's a,
he's a great guy.

1573
01:13:33,691 --> 01:13:36,750
He's just,
he's in the era of John Jones,

1574
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:37,883
you know,
and he lost to John and his first fight 

1575
01:13:39,241 --> 01:13:41,190
and he was also dealing with the fact 
that John,

1576
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:43,710
although I love John to John's a fuck 
up,

1577
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:44,933
you know,
and so he's got to sort of be there 

1578
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:49,530
while John keeps fucking up and then a 
lot of it comes back to him,

1579
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,483
but that's where I look at DC and why I 
try to give them all the respect in the 

1580
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:57,960
world I can because I don't feel that 
people give enough respect to dc for the

1581
01:13:57,961 --> 01:14:00,570
fact that he's not fucking know he's a 
great outcome.

1582
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:01,403
You.
Right.

1583
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,390
How does that get overlooked?
Well,

1584
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,240
I think a lot of it has to do with 
people can connect fuckups yeah,

1585
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,390
too.
There's this,

1586
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:10,230
you know what I mean?
And,

1587
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:14,590
and John Jones is that good?
That's the other thing is literally that

1588
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,730
good.
He's that good.

1589
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,920
He can beat you after you did coke three
weeks ago.

1590
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,960
I don't know what to say,
but the thing about John,

1591
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,060
I'm good enough to win after three 
surgeries,

1592
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:25,240
so let's see what we can.
We can test the waters on Bob.

1593
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:26,074
Let's see who does what.
I'll do a line of coke next time and to 

1594
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,830
try to jump in there and see how I do 
it.

1595
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:32,230
Let's blow his knees out three times and
they will see his better.

1596
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:33,610
Well,
that's a different animal.

1597
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:35,000
You know?
I mean it's,

1598
01:14:35,001 --> 01:14:37,480
it's interesting that sometimes people 
are just supreme.

1599
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:38,314
We talented physically and they don't 
have to deal with as many trials and 

1600
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:42,820
tribulations in that regard.

1601
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:45,820
You know,
he's very gifted like John.

1602
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:47,170
It's,
it's interesting.

1603
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,333
I've always said this there,
there's a way that John gets a hold of 

1604
01:14:51,551 --> 01:14:52,384
people that you know,
you could almost tell when he gets a 

1605
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:58,330
hold of them that they've really have 
never felt anything like that before.

1606
01:14:58,480 --> 01:14:59,313
And you saw it with DC.
You know dc who's a supreme really 

1607
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,080
talented wrestler.
I mean one of the best wrestlers to ever

1608
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:05,914
compete in MMA.
Jon Jones got ahold of them and you 

1609
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:10,720
could see dc was like,
oh shit,

1610
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:13,210
like this guy is no joke.
I agree.

1611
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:17,560
I mean John's stud.
Yeah,

1612
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:19,630
he's that good.
He's not good.

1613
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:21,130
Is that good?
But so was DC.

1614
01:15:21,131 --> 01:15:21,964
The DC could still beat him.
I really believe that it's entirely 

1615
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:26,800
possible.
There was still a very close fight.

1616
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:29,350
I would probably,
if I had to choose on paper,

1617
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:32,050
you take Jones depending on how healthy 
he is.

1618
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:34,470
Well DC was so furious that he didn't 
fight it in the oven.

1619
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,130
St [inaudible] fight because he was 
like,

1620
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,630
I would've beat that Jon Jones because I
did commentary with them.

1621
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,780
Fine.
I would've beat that Jon Jones and,

1622
01:15:40,781 --> 01:15:42,790
and,
and here's another thing on that.

1623
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,890
Okay,
because how's that?

1624
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:46,773
That might not be true either because 
that Jon Jones would have trained 

1625
01:15:49,781 --> 01:15:54,781
differently for you than he who knows?
And he was a very late replacement.

1626
01:15:56,171 --> 01:15:59,170
Don't forget this though.
I mean how much does he hate dc?

1627
01:15:59,171 --> 01:16:01,020
He's not going to.
Oh yeah.

1628
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:01,943
That was a different level of training 
you're doing for different people and 

1629
01:16:04,071 --> 01:16:05,980
where your emotions are with that human 
being.

1630
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:07,450
That's a really good point.
It is.

1631
01:16:07,451 --> 01:16:09,850
And don't you think that was a big 
factor in the first fight as well?

1632
01:16:09,851 --> 01:16:12,490
Because DC was very emotionally wrapped 
up and finding John.

1633
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:15,910
It was very intense because he had never
had anybody disrespect him like that.

1634
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:19,180
They had that fistfight at the press had
to do with it.

1635
01:16:19,210 --> 01:16:20,290
Sure.
Of course.

1636
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,390
That has to do with every fight has to 
do with my flight.

1637
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,530
It has to do with all of them.
You have to calculate it.

1638
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:25,390
I had to do it.
Conor mcgregor,

1639
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:27,003
Rousey's fight.
Anderson Silva's fights when he's 

1640
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,300
showboating everything.
I mean you can go.

1641
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:35,340
The list goes on to the mental problems 
that a lot of these athletes have hadn't

1642
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,300
usually at the mental isn't there.
They lose.

1643
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,093
It comes down to that and you also got 
to go back to the way Daniel cormier 

1644
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,513
handled rumble.
He's the only guy that's been able to 

1645
01:16:44,411 --> 01:16:47,980
eat rumble shots,
absorb them and come back and break him.

1646
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,570
You know,
that was a.

1647
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,351
I mean,
yeah,

1648
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,260
he ate that right hand and just hit his 
head on the floor,

1649
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:56,530
woke back up and then went after it and 
that's,

1650
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:57,963
you know,
that's respectable to that that I don't 

1651
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:03,940
think fans or anybody can really 
understand what it takes to get slightly

1652
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:06,970
knocked out,
stand back up and want to keep going.

1653
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:07,893
Yeah.
That's a different level of 

1654
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:10,940
understanding of the sport,
like as an athlete,

1655
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:14,000
when I watch a fight or go through that 
and keep their composure,

1656
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:14,834
move around and deal with that problem 
and then even if they lose but stay in 

1657
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:20,810
the fight and go the distance and tough 
it out.

1658
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:22,940
Like Diego Sanchez,
great example of that.

1659
01:17:23,710 --> 01:17:26,880
So like how do you not respect and,
and have a,

1660
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,393
a real logical understanding of that 
human being is built from something 

1661
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:33,560
different.
That's insane.

1662
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:34,394
He just,
there's fighters that come back and his 

1663
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:39,410
fighters had almost never come back.
It's really interesting.

1664
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,650
Like we were talking about like Bj Penn,
one of the all time greats,

1665
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:45,440
a can't remember a fight where Bj was 
losing,

1666
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:48,110
where he came back and won.
Frankie Edgar,

1667
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:48,944
on the other hand,
you can never count that motherfucker 

1668
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:51,464
out ever true.
Frankie Edgar in the gray maynard 

1669
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,134
fights,
there's to those two chaotic fights was 

1670
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:59,720
so close to being stopped in the first 
round were gray.

1671
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,553
Maynard is putting it on him and Frankie
is going down and down again and 

1672
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:04,784
stumbling around the octagon and gray 
catch keeps catching him and frankie 

1673
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:10,640
goes on to stop him.
I mean,

1674
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,760
that was insane.
Then those two fights were insane and he

1675
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:15,580
should go down as one of the best ever 
for that.

1676
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,630
You know what I mean?
It's like stuff like that,

1677
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:18,523
those fights where they want to withdraw
and then the other one when he beat 

1678
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:21,890
them,
and it's true.

1679
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:25,220
You gotta it's hard though because 
there's so many crazy fights.

1680
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,800
He can get credit to everybody.
It's like,

1681
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:31,050
how do you,
how do you really dictate who gets what?

1682
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:32,993
Because they're all.
We're all putting our life out there on 

1683
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,910
the line too.
So every single one of these,

1684
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:37,783
just as serious as the next and every 
single one of us is sacrifice just as 

1685
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:41,474
much as the next.

1686
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:42,493
So at what point do you really start 
drawing the line as to who is the best 

1687
01:18:45,801 --> 01:18:48,440
and who was it?
I think it has to come down to who stays

1688
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:50,060
the longest.
Yeah.

1689
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,070
No,
I agree with you was really,

1690
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:57,200
that's why I put fate or overcame as the
best heavyweight of all time.

1691
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,970
Although I still think I maintain the 
cane when he was at his best.

1692
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,710
It was far as like what I see him,
what he was able to do two guys and what

1693
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:08,750
I see from his performance inside the 
octagon,

1694
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:13,600
especially his cardio as a heavyweight 
is clean technique is wrestling the pace

1695
01:19:13,601 --> 01:19:14,434
he puts on guys his chin.
I don't think there has been ever 

1696
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:17,834
anybody like Cain I think came when he 
was at his prime was the best I've ever 

1697
01:19:20,151 --> 01:19:22,580
seen.
I never got to see fate or fight live,

1698
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:26,150
but I would say if you have to give an 
all time great to a heavyweight.

1699
01:19:26,180 --> 01:19:29,540
I kind of leaned towards fader because 
he stayed on top longer,

1700
01:19:29,541 --> 01:19:30,374
beat more guys longer,
obviously be compared to cane Noguera 

1701
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:38,480
and his prime cro cop in his prime 
fought some freaks,

1702
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:41,890
like semi Schiltz took him down and when
that was in the early days.

1703
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:45,050
Yeah,
when like it was still very limited.

1704
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:48,210
It was wild rules as far as supplements 
go.

1705
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,690
Take whatever you want,
motherfucker.

1706
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:51,553
Let's get this party going.
Let's see if we can get you bigger than 

1707
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:55,760
Joe Rogan.
Everyone's bigger and bigger than me,

1708
01:19:55,761 --> 01:19:57,570
man.
I was tiny compared to crow.

1709
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:01,340
Okay.
Lorenzo and to Lorenzo's gorilla.

1710
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,640
Yeah.
Cro Cop just won the rise in Grand Prix.

1711
01:20:04,641 --> 01:20:08,610
I mean he's a shell of himself in the 
UFC under Usada testing.

1712
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:11,220
They send them off to Japan and all of a
sudden he's Super Cro.

1713
01:20:11,221 --> 01:20:13,350
Cop again.
Come look sensational.

1714
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,450
I didn't see that.
Oh,

1715
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,960
he looked fantastic.
That one.

1716
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,700
Boxing look fantastic.
Well,

1717
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:20,940
he went and did some kickboxing,
looked really good in kickboxing again,

1718
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:23,850
and then fall and rise and in one wonder
heavyweight Grand Prix.

1719
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:27,810
He mean he looked extraordinary.
He looked like the cro cop of old.

1720
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:29,730
He really did.
He really turned back the clock,

1721
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,830
watch it,
and then he decided I'm good.

1722
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:32,664
I'm done.
I ended my career with an amazing high 

1723
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:36,330
note to.
Awesome.

1724
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:37,011
Yeah.
And,

1725
01:20:37,011 --> 01:20:39,180
and very rarely do people come back and 
do that.

1726
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,080
Yeah.
You know,

1727
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:41,223
need a little help.
A little help from Dr. Mexican 

1728
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:47,460
supplements.
Well,

1729
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,920
what it they say what it ricky bobby 
said it best.

1730
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,253
What is that?
Yeah,

1731
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,860
cheating gain trying.
Is that what he said?

1732
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:54,570
I thought was you ain't first.
You're last.

1733
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,493
Maybe it's both or maybe I still have 
from a different movie sheet and they'd 

1734
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,980
try it.
That's like real old,

1735
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:00,843
right?

1736
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,580
Yeah.
Maybe that was somebody else.

1737
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:03,900
Maybe it was just,
I don't know.

1738
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:05,880
Yeah,
no old guy yelling at me.

1739
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:06,833
I mean there's that,
but that you always have to have that 

1740
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:12,800
asterisk next pride that there was no 
drug testing and I've had an incident.

1741
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,880
You went here on a couple times where 
anthony was talking about it.

1742
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:18,060
They're in the contracts.
It said in capital letters,

1743
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:23,210
we will not test you for steroids.
And Ensign was laughing about it.

1744
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:24,600
He's like,
what the fuck?

1745
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,220
Like,
is this what I'm fighting?

1746
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,740
But they were just selling you like we 
want to have some fun.

1747
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:29,633
Yeah.
But I remember even because I was part 

1748
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:34,050
of the sport in the air and I'm so glad 
I really am.

1749
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,130
I'm so glad I was part of the sport 
during that time.

1750
01:21:36,131 --> 01:21:38,650
And I was just coming up in it.
I was like maybe two,

1751
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:39,513
three and know at this point when I can 
specifically remember a time having to 

1752
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:47,530
make a decision at 21 years old.
Do I want to be in the IFL?

1753
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:48,933
Do I want to go try out for the ultimate
fighter or do I just keep working with 

1754
01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:53,520
three jobs,
coaching,

1755
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,390
wrestling,
doing what I'm doing here in Tucson as a

1756
01:21:55,391 --> 01:21:56,224
janitor,
stay with my money in and just be 

1757
01:21:57,761 --> 01:22:00,310
patient,
keep winning fights until I get there.

1758
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:04,540
And uh,
I was 20 years old.

1759
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:10,290
They were offering me $2,000 a month to,
to fight in the IFL with the sabers,

1760
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,173
which was um,
this was forever ago in $2,000 a month 

1761
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:20,080
for me.
Would it changed my life?

1762
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,990
I'm 20 years old.
Um,

1763
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,490
I'm living paycheck to paycheck and I'm 
doing all these jobs.

1764
01:22:24,490 --> 01:22:27,430
I can quit all my jobs and focus on 
training 24 slash seven.

1765
01:22:27,550 --> 01:22:30,190
That's my mindset with $2,000 a month.
Heck yeah,

1766
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:31,870
you can do that.
That's the way to go.

1767
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,990
But wait a second,
there is no 135 pound weight class.

1768
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:38,080
There's no 145 pound weight class.
It's only 1:55 and up.

1769
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:43,090
So I'm already eating as much as I can,
trying to put weight on and get into the

1770
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:46,060
weight class to fight at 155 pounds.
What do you walk around?

1771
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:50,170
And then right now,
now I'm walking around 55 60,

1772
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:51,273
but then at 20 years old,
40 to 142 pounds trying to eat 

1773
01:22:55,871 --> 01:23:00,871
everything I can insight and um,
between that and 50,

1774
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,260
you know,
1:50.

1775
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:03,483
So I said you're too small for that.
I felt if they lock you into that 

1776
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:08,950
contract for two grand a month,
they're going to throw you out there,

1777
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:09,670
you're going to lose twice.

1778
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:11,890
They're going to cut you and then you 
didn't get any money and you lost.

1779
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:12,933
Now you got to losses on your record 
because these guys are monsters and how 

1780
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:19,510
do you come back from that?
So I said,

1781
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:20,650
alright,
I'm going to say no to that.

1782
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:21,484
I fell.
I'm going to go to trial for the 

1783
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:23,800
ultimate fighter,
try it out for the ultimate fighter.

1784
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:26,500
Didn't get in,
lost that opportunity.

1785
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,310
So then I just kept training and that's 
when I got my first fight at six and now

1786
01:23:30,311 --> 01:23:31,330
I was five.
No,

1787
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:35,050
got an offer on two days notice to go 
fight and total combat,

1788
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:35,884
which is now my coach,
Eric del Pharaohs a promotion back then 

1789
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:42,550
he was a promoter and I took the fight,
fought it,

1790
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:44,710
and then I met Eric and that was the 
beginning of that.

1791
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:45,693
Wow.
So you were living in Arizona at the 

1792
01:23:46,661 --> 01:23:48,460
time and that's how you moved down to 
San Diego.

1793
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:49,600
Tucson,
Tucson,

1794
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:50,434
Arizona.
I was raised there from two years old 

1795
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:56,110
until I was 21 till I moved to San 
Diego.

1796
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:57,400
And for favor,
favor,

1797
01:23:57,401 --> 01:24:00,820
fight in 2007 was the first camp I ever 
had a coach.

1798
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,310
Never had a coach before that point.
Um,

1799
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:07,690
I'd never been to Vegas.
I just legally able to go there.

1800
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:11,050
Uh,
there's a lot of things I'd never gotten

1801
01:24:11,051 --> 01:24:11,860
to do with it.
I,

1802
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:14,140
it was incredible to get to do that back
then.

1803
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:18,760
First fight ever on television.
And the WEC was the WC I get to fight in

1804
01:24:18,761 --> 01:24:20,340
front of chocolate down and Tito Ortiz 
in the,

1805
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:21,243
in the,
in the,

1806
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:22,390
uh,
audience.

1807
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:23,283
Wow.
Weird things like that that I remember 

1808
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:26,740
that was like,
what am I doing here?

1809
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:29,020
What am I doing here?
I made it.

1810
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:30,740
Yeah.
And uh,

1811
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:33,490
the game just to be part of the game at 
that point.

1812
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Diego Sanchez is the man at 185 pounds,
like a get to training.

1813
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,370
That was ultimate fighter season one 
when farther.

1814
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,533
And that's,
those are the guys I'm watching saying 

1815
01:24:44,801 --> 01:24:46,870
I'm going to do this.
Wow.

1816
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:48,700
So when you tried out for the ultimate 
fighter,

1817
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:52,150
what season was it?
I think it was like two or three times.

1818
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,150
So you were trying to 55 then?
I was.

1819
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:58,300
Wow.
And I have three fights at 55.

1820
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,940
I have three fights at 45 for I member.
Right.

1821
01:25:01,810 --> 01:25:03,100
Also.
Wow.

1822
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:08,310
So at the time when this was going on,
2005 when you started out was right when

1823
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,354
Stephan Bonner and forrest griffin had 
that epic fight in the finals of the 

1824
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:13,874
ultimate fighter season one and it 
launched mma and that's what made me 

1825
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:19,120
decide and that's when I'm going to 
school,

1826
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:20,560
you see?
So I'm like,

1827
01:25:20,561 --> 01:25:21,550
all right,
this thing is,

1828
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,710
this is the time if you're going to do 
it,

1829
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:27,580
get in now and just see what you can do 
with it.

1830
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,690
Go all in.
And I'm like,

1831
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,780
you might make it or keep going to 
school,

1832
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,420
go get you.
I wanted to be an emt firefighter.

1833
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,160
That was the goal.
And it was like,

1834
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,740
you know,
what do I do?

1835
01:25:38,741 --> 01:25:40,380
Do I,
I have so much stability.

1836
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:43,090
I got three jobs,
I got money coming in,

1837
01:25:43,091 --> 01:25:44,650
I'm comfortable.
I'm going to school,

1838
01:25:44,651 --> 01:25:46,810
I'm doing the picture.
Perfect.

1839
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:47,740
Twenty,
19,

1840
01:25:47,741 --> 01:25:51,640
20 year old vision for a kid who wants 
to be something right,

1841
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,020
going to school,
working.

1842
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:56,620
I threw it all away and just said screw 
it.

1843
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,410
And uh,
it was nerve wracking,

1844
01:25:59,411 --> 01:26:01,380
but like I said,
I didn't do it until I asked my mom.

1845
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,860
My mom didn't even the fact that she 
didn't even like

1846
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,710
think about it,
like I didn't think about it.

1847
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,850
Wow.
I didn't even think about.

1848
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,960
I just quit my job,
packed all my shit up in an eclipse.

1849
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:13,303
My car couldn't make it to California,
so I had to have my friend's truck tow 

1850
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:19,800
it on a trailer.
Everything I owned in the car.

1851
01:26:19,801 --> 01:26:20,634
And then we drove the truck.
Semi truck basically became a shed for 

1852
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,330
everything.
I have my card in my car,

1853
01:26:26,331 --> 01:26:27,920
became a set for everything I owned,
you know.

1854
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,320
Wow.
Move out there.

1855
01:26:29,321 --> 01:26:31,310
But so many stories like that come on.
I mean,

1856
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:33,050
how many MMA fighters have that story at
ton.

1857
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,063
Well,
it's what is interesting to go back to 

1858
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:35,804
your style,
you're very unique style is that you 

1859
01:26:37,221 --> 01:26:40,100
really did come along when the sport was
in its.

1860
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:43,520
I wouldn't say it's infancy,
but it was like a teenager at the time.

1861
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:45,770
The sport,
the sport was really only 12,

1862
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:50,150
13 years old and I'm so glad I got 
anything because that exact fact,

1863
01:26:50,151 --> 01:26:52,970
what you just mentioned is why I knew I 
could do something different.

1864
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:54,463
That's why,
because it was growing and there was so 

1865
01:26:55,881 --> 01:27:00,440
much room to knew I could do things 
nobody had ever seen and it wasn't wrong

1866
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:02,550
anymore because this is new.
Right.

1867
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,610
And if you say I'm wrong,
I say fuck you.

1868
01:27:04,611 --> 01:27:07,760
I'm going to do it my way because this 
is new where there wasn't an established

1869
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,060
orthodox like a,
you know,

1870
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,090
there was the style.
There was though,

1871
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:13,160
and I got rid of killed my whole career.
Was there,

1872
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:14,890
like in the household,
what were they saying to you?

1873
01:27:14,930 --> 01:27:16,940
You're not supposed to do that.
You're boxing.

1874
01:27:16,941 --> 01:27:17,774
You're not supposed to do that.
You're kickbox and you're not supposed 

1875
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:20,270
to do that.
You're wrestling,

1876
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:23,060
but I'm not doing any of those things.
I'm doing them all mixed together.

1877
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,790
So how are you telling me I'm doing 
something wrong right now?

1878
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,673
Well,
one of the things that are said about 

1879
01:27:26,961 --> 01:27:28,610
you,
I said,

1880
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:32,840
if you watch dominick Cruz fight,
I would tell you don't fight like that,

1881
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,213
but look how God damn good he is at it,
so you can't say don't fight like that 

1882
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:41,240
because he's not just like the way you 
throw punches,

1883
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:44,180
the way you move and throw punches and 
throw punches from odd angles.

1884
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:45,283
You could tell someone if someone was 
like a very traditional technical coach 

1885
01:27:49,301 --> 01:27:50,870
who would say that is the wrong way to 
throw punches,

1886
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:52,033
but I would say no because look,
he's fucking landing them and they're 

1887
01:27:56,151 --> 01:27:59,520
hurting the guy and he uses them a lot 
as very effective with.

1888
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:03,470
That will always be my argument with 
every conventional coach and this is why

1889
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:05,840
I break.
What makes them relevant?

1890
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:07,723
Well,
it's not necessarily you break what 

1891
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:09,254
makes them relevant.
You figure out a way to make your style 

1892
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:14,430
work in a way that confounds the 
experts.

1893
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,400
Well,
what I mean by that is when they talk to

1894
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:20,870
me maybe not to $20 million other 
people,

1895
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:23,870
they are that shit,
but when you try to tell me that,

1896
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,973
and I've had.
I can't tell you how many countless 

1897
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:30,260
world champion kick boxing coaches go.
Only you can do that.

1898
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:31,400
You're awesome.

1899
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,040
Keep doing it.
And I and I couldn't disagree more.

1900
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:35,503
Well,
anybody can do it if they mimic your 

1901
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:37,544
movements and your movements aren't like
Cirque de Solei movements that you have 

1902
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:40,514
to be like physically gifted in order to
pull off or work towards them for 100 

1903
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:44,510
years.
Yeah.

1904
01:28:44,510 --> 01:28:45,710
I'm not going to sit here and break it 
down,

1905
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:49,460
but there are obviously movements that 
I'm doing and they can be read.

1906
01:28:49,461 --> 01:28:53,390
It took 30 rounds to figure out what the
same camp for 10 years,

1907
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:54,910
but they figured it out.
Right.

1908
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,780
You know they can,
they can imitate.

1909
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:58,510
You ever see Justin Buchholz do.
Yeah.

1910
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:00,470
They're usually pretty well know what 
they're doing,

1911
01:29:00,471 --> 01:29:02,280
but who

1912
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,320
else has fought somebody as much as they
fought me.

1913
01:29:04,321 --> 01:29:05,910
I mean think about it.
Benevidez twice.

1914
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:07,650
Favorite twice.
Tj dillashaw,

1915
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,750
Charlie Valencia,
his fall with them.

1916
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:12,690
Scott Jorgensen train with them before I
fought him.

1917
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:13,813
I'm Ian Mccall,
train with them for a tiny bit of time 

1918
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:20,610
before I fought him.
I'm essentially every single person I've

1919
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:21,444
ever fought for the past 10 years has at
some point been friends with favorite 

1920
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:25,344
trained with that camp because they were
the little guy camp while I said why 

1921
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:29,454
join them if you can beat them,
and I just did it my own way and let 

1922
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:34,890
them all hate me and trained together 
and it was okay with me,

1923
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,040
you know,
I needed to do things my way in order to

1924
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:38,874
build something different in a,
in a game that hadn't really caught up 

1925
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:45,090
to the things that I was thinking about 
yet in my opinion.

1926
01:29:45,510 --> 01:29:46,590
Um,
it didn't make me.

1927
01:29:46,591 --> 01:29:47,424
The only one that was right in these 
things is just how I used the things 

1928
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,900
that I used.
They had theirs too.

1929
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,410
But my whole mindset was,
like I said,

1930
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:56,753
if I fight like them,
I'm going to be like them and they're 

1931
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:01,200
going to adjust to me.
Like they adjust everybody else.

1932
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:04,810
Now going back to the early days when 
you sort of learn the style,

1933
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:05,644
we kind of got off this,
but I really wanted to touch back on it 

1934
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:12,660
when you said that your style.
No one had your style before.

1935
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,103
No one could tell you that it was the 
wrong way to do it because you're being 

1936
01:30:17,531 --> 01:30:18,364
very effective with it,
but did you take it from anywhere and 

1937
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:25,390
did you look at boxing footage?
Did you look at kickboxing or Muay Thai?

1938
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:27,340
Like where did you get all your foot 
work from?

1939
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,570
Well,
there's a mixture of things.

1940
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:29,433
One,
it all started with me fighting at 155 

1941
01:30:32,471 --> 01:30:34,300
pounds,
weighing 142 pounds.

1942
01:30:34,301 --> 01:30:35,134
That's where this whole mindset started,
so it was there already twice as big as 

1943
01:30:38,861 --> 01:30:41,170
you and on fight day they're going to be
three times as big as you,

1944
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,483
so you better not get touched.
You better not get grabbed and you 

1945
01:30:44,321 --> 01:30:45,154
better not get hit at all.
Don't let him touch you because they're 

1946
01:30:46,781 --> 01:30:48,370
too big.
They take you down.

1947
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,680
Your energy is going to be zapped by the
time you do get up.

1948
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:51,543
If you get up and if the hit you,
they're big and strong and they're 

1949
01:30:54,341 --> 01:30:57,340
probably going to put you out.
So you have to use all that strength,

1950
01:30:57,341 --> 01:30:58,174
all that size against them and make it 
their weakness instead of their 

1951
01:31:00,881 --> 01:31:01,714
strength.
And that's how I started because I was 

1952
01:31:03,101 --> 01:31:05,280
so little that I said,
all right,

1953
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:06,580
I need to focus on defense.

1954
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,740
Um,
obviously I got to hurt him too.

1955
01:31:08,741 --> 01:31:09,574
But after they do what they're trying to
do with their big strength and be 

1956
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:14,980
stronger and be more powerful and be 
more athletic,

1957
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:16,053
they're going to wear themselves out.
And then now we're even round middle 

1958
01:31:19,151 --> 01:31:19,984
around to all those things that they had
early where even now and now I can just 

1959
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:24,670
sell them and pick them apart and beat 
them.

1960
01:31:25,180 --> 01:31:30,180
And I always had that mentality rather 
than fight fire with fire.

1961
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,730
It just didn't make sense to me.
When my body was on the line,

1962
01:31:33,731 --> 01:31:34,564
I wanted the path of least resistance.
And so it started with that until I got 

1963
01:31:38,771 --> 01:31:41,440
to about five and l five in total 
combat.

1964
01:31:42,190 --> 01:31:45,260
I took that fight on two days notice.
Went out there with no coaches,

1965
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,143
no corner men and women myself,
and they just picked corner mit random 

1966
01:31:48,071 --> 01:31:52,000
corner men and put them in out there 
that night was why eric liked me because

1967
01:31:52,001 --> 01:31:53,290
he saw,
you know,

1968
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,810
I took it at short notice,
won it.

1969
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,980
It was a tough fight,
but I had no car man.

1970
01:31:56,981 --> 01:32:00,280
I came solo on a flight and just went 
and so he's like,

1971
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:01,690
okay,
I can work with this,

1972
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:02,890
you know,
this guy wants to do it.

1973
01:32:02,891 --> 01:32:03,724
So he picked me up.
But then that's really when the 

1974
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:09,910
progression started meeting Eric like,
and that's because I'd never had.

1975
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,340
I mean I had pads held for me here and 
there in Tucson,

1976
01:32:12,341 --> 01:32:13,174
but only if guys were getting 65 bucks 
to do it or something for it because 

1977
01:32:18,430 --> 01:32:20,080
there's not a lot of money and fight 
game.

1978
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:20,973
So they're all as hungry as I am the 
trainers and I wasn't really like some 

1979
01:32:25,511 --> 01:32:26,344
star pupil that everybody wanted to get 
on board and make a world champion at 

1980
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:31,390
this point I was just a guy,
right?

1981
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:35,620
So I wasn't getting pad work.
I wasn't getting one on one training.

1982
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:36,813
I lined up my own coaching,
I'd have guys that knew what they were 

1983
01:32:38,951 --> 01:32:40,210
doing,
being pro boxers,

1984
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:41,044
pro high level wrestlers,
high level blue belts at this time and 

1985
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:44,793
role and wrestle and make my own team 
and my own coaches with the people that 

1986
01:32:48,161 --> 01:32:48,994
I had available,
but I didn't have a head and when I 

1987
01:32:51,821 --> 01:32:55,090
found eric at six and I won that fight,
found eric and he said,

1988
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:55,924
I'll coach you,
I'll get you a manager and I'll get all 

1989
01:32:57,491 --> 01:33:00,640
this figured out for you.
That's what I was really looking for.

1990
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:02,403
That's why I went to California and got 
Outta Tucson's because I knew I wasn't 

1991
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:08,980
finding that in Tucson when I went there
and got that,

1992
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:10,150
it was like a gift.
I was like,

1993
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:11,073
this is what I'm talking about.
I knew if I went there and one with no 

1994
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:15,340
one in my corner,
somebody would want to pick me up.

1995
01:33:16,150 --> 01:33:16,983
And they did.
Eric did and we stayed together ever 

1996
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,174
since.
So was your style something that you 

1997
01:33:21,881 --> 01:33:25,270
worked on with Eric,
like learning those footwork drills?

1998
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:26,920
Like when,
when you came to him,

1999
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:30,050
you have essentially we're a smaller guy
who were fa,

2000
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:33,630
was fighting bigger guys and had to be a
little trickier in your movement.

2001
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,750
Where were you getting that stuff from?
Well now I,

2002
01:33:35,950 --> 01:33:37,060
uh,
when I meet Eric,

2003
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:40,030
I'm no longer the smaller guy fighting 
bigger guys because,

2004
01:33:40,090 --> 01:33:41,020
well,
a little bit,

2005
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:44,080
but 45 and 30,
45 is now allowed.

2006
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:47,340
Now 145 pounds is just getting into 
these small shows,

2007
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:52,380
not just the WEC.
So by the time I met Eric at six and no,

2008
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:53,743
I'm,
I take that fight on two days notice at 

2009
01:33:55,571 --> 01:33:58,870
145 pounds.
But I was getting ready to fight at 1:55

2010
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:01,840
in Colorado for a world title.
But the whole show got canceled.

2011
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:04,360
That's why I was in shape to take the 
fight on two days notice.

2012
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:09,640
So when I met Eric,
the 45 pound weight class was there 55?

2013
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:12,730
A was the one that was basking.
So that's,

2014
01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:17,820
that was how I got into the UFC.
But your question exactly was what was,

2015
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:21,940
how did you devise your movement?
How did you devise your footwork?

2016
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,880
Did you study other stuff?
Did you learn it with Eric?

2017
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,700
Did you guys put it together?
Honestly,

2018
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:28,534
like I had a couple things that I did 
naturally and then Eric and Eric has a 

2019
01:34:31,571 --> 01:34:36,130
skillset where he,
if you have a natural movement,

2020
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:40,250
he doesn't tell you to to fix it,
he lets you do it and then turns it in,

2021
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:44,980
has you add a weapon to it?
That's his gift and I had a lot of those

2022
01:34:44,981 --> 01:34:49,300
little weird things that I did and those
weird odd things you had just devised to

2023
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:50,770
learn how to bigger people.

2024
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,633
Yeah,
and is a mixture of wrestling stance 

2025
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:56,980
with punching and kicking.
I kind of have a.

2026
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:59,840
If you watch wrestling that there's no 
set stance.

2027
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,600
There's no set w,
you know what I mean?

2028
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,280
It's constant.
If you watch college,

2029
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:06,620
high school,
like the highest level wrestlers,

2030
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:07,603
it's all fluid motion in both stances.
So I made fighting that because I 

2031
01:35:11,181 --> 01:35:12,014
started out wrestling and then I added 
the punches and the kicks to that move 

2032
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:15,913
to that motion instead of trying to 
change what I already did with my 

2033
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:19,094
wrestling and try to make it this way,
he just let me do what I did up to five 

2034
01:35:23,351 --> 01:35:27,290
and o with my wrestling and whatever I 
taught myself and then he just tightened

2035
01:35:27,291 --> 01:35:30,590
it up and made it into a pro level.
Look to an extent,

2036
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:33,950
speed,
timing range,

2037
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,843
these type of things.
And now what do you have it now as a 

2038
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:37,850
system?

2039
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:40,760
Do you have it organized?
You have a town now?

2040
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:43,220
I have a system but I'm a visual learner
so you could.

2041
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:44,713
You could literally just do a movement 
in front of me and I'll learn it really 

2042
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:48,254
quick.
But if you write it or I have to read 

2043
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:50,744
it,
I'll never get it.

2044
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:54,110
It's all visual.
So I just.

2045
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:55,353
There are certain things that I was 
running into when I would spar early on 

2046
01:35:59,031 --> 01:36:03,680
starting that I came up with habits to 
deal with because of my wrestling and my

2047
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,610
and and not having a coach that instead 
of the coach saying,

2048
01:36:06,611 --> 01:36:07,430
no,
do this,

2049
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:08,263
I just adjusted and found my own answers
and do keep a training log of all these 

2050
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:15,280
lessons that you learned.
Nod.

2051
01:36:15,370 --> 01:36:17,240
I know them.
They're just all in your mind.

2052
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:18,074
Yeah,
I know him.

2053
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,520
I know him.
I know him very well.

2054
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,430
Studied it 100 percent confident that 
you keep that stuff in your memory.

2055
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:23,750
You don't need to write it down.
No,

2056
01:36:23,751 --> 01:36:26,380
I don't need to write it down because I 
drill it at once.

2057
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,040
I have a memory.
I don't just write it.

2058
01:36:28,041 --> 01:36:29,510
I do it.
I drill it,

2059
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:32,810
pad work a show Eric and I'll say,
what do you think about this?

2060
01:36:32,811 --> 01:36:33,471
And he'll be like,
okay,

2061
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:35,390
well I do this,
this and this to make it a little better

2062
01:36:35,391 --> 01:36:36,224
and keep you dah,
Dah,

2063
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:38,150
Dah.
And then we use it.

2064
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:39,313
But I mean I'm using.
I'm not using the craziest moves in the 

2065
01:36:43,131 --> 01:36:43,551
world.
You know,

2066
01:36:43,551 --> 01:36:48,551
Jon Jones used crazy moves a certain 
people like a Stevens,

2067
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:53,990
Steven Thompson throat has crazy moves.
You know what I mean?

2068
01:36:54,410 --> 01:36:55,243
I'm actually using crazy movements to 
stay defensive and offensive 

2069
01:36:57,951 --> 01:37:00,020
simultaneously.
That's,

2070
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,973
that's the idea to do both at the same 
time and to be very hard to read what 

2071
01:37:04,501 --> 01:37:05,334
you're hard to read if you're being 
offensive and defensive at the same 

2072
01:37:07,251 --> 01:37:07,820
time.

2073
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:08,180
Yeah.
It's,

2074
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,120
it's hard to read because you don't know
if I'm being offensive or defensive.

2075
01:37:11,121 --> 01:37:16,100
It's one or the other or both.
I can do both because where I put myself

2076
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,920
on defensively in a.
generally speaking,

2077
01:37:19,921 --> 01:37:20,754
when I,
when I've been doing very well in my 

2078
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,870
matchups,
I put myself in the,

2079
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:25,243
in the,
in the gray area where even if you do 

2080
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:29,810
hit me,
it's limited power and I'm still able to

2081
01:37:29,811 --> 01:37:31,970
hit you more and you're able to hit me 
basically.

2082
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,800
That's the idea.
Now,

2083
01:37:33,830 --> 01:37:35,810
generally,
here you are,

2084
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:37,250
you're,
you're coming off of,

2085
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,350
uh,
the toughest laws for your career.

2086
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:40,490
You,
you lose to cody.

2087
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:41,324
No love in a very,
very tough fight against a super 

2088
01:37:43,161 --> 01:37:44,350
talented guy.
Yeah.

2089
01:37:44,590 --> 01:37:47,060
How did you,
how do you feel about that fight and how

2090
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:49,130
do you feel right now?
I feel good.

2091
01:37:49,131 --> 01:37:52,880
I just want to heal up my,
my body a little bit that that year,

2092
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:55,740
doing the three camps,
coming back after the couch.

2093
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,790
It just,
it was,

2094
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:00,510
it was the heart.
It was a hard year.

2095
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,373
It was a good year.
It was weren't conditioned when you 

2096
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:06,720
first started,
but that also affected my style.

2097
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:07,583
Like if you look at the last three 
fights this year and my fights before 

2098
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:12,480
the injuries,
I threw a million more kicks.

2099
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,220
Well,
you looked out standing against Uriah.

2100
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:17,100
You looked like your body didn't look as
good with Tj.

2101
01:38:17,101 --> 01:38:19,710
You looked like I was her.
Right.

2102
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:20,813
That was the one where I was hurt.
You can tell you tell physically by 

2103
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:23,724
looking and by the favorite fight I felt
I did strength training camp for that 

2104
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:28,854
whole camp.
That's the difference of having a 

2105
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:33,750
strength training camp and not having a 
structured where the way you looked.

2106
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:34,673
Right,
but my cardio was through the roof 

2107
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:38,670
because I implemented sprints instead of
strength and the strength.

2108
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:40,223
Whereas for the favor of fight,
I could do strength training because I 

2109
01:38:41,851 --> 01:38:42,684
had enough time and my sprints so I 
could double up on the workload to make 

2110
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:49,290
my body stronger,
more fast,

2111
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:52,560
more efficient,
and more than anything tougher to take,

2112
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:53,453
better to take damage,
better your core tufting of or 

2113
01:38:55,870 --> 01:38:59,550
everything in kids taking punches feels 
night and day different now.

2114
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:01,770
Even for the cody fight,
I felt great.

2115
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:02,663
I do.
I do look at that fight and I think 

2116
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:05,213
maybe I could have waited,
but I knew a so I wouldn't overwork 

2117
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:10,560
myself in that year with,
uh,

2118
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:15,620
with the training and stuff because it's
one thing to take three fights in a year

2119
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:18,090
and it's another thing to take three 
title fights in a year.

2120
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,580
Anybody can say whatever they want.
I fought six times this year.

2121
01:39:20,581 --> 01:39:22,080
Yeah,
but you didn't fight three.

2122
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:25,050
You didn't go through three title fight 
camps and then fight.

2123
01:39:25,051 --> 01:39:28,380
These guys were the best in the world.
That's a different thing.

2124
01:39:28,710 --> 01:39:31,970
It's so much more work.
It's going to five rounds and it's a lot

2125
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:32,813
of workload,
but the camp is really where the damage 

2126
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:37,590
is done.
Not that fight,

2127
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:39,660
the camps are just painful for five 
rounds,

2128
01:39:39,661 --> 01:39:41,640
just the way it is.
But um,

2129
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:42,983
with,
after getting through that fight with 

2130
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:44,484
cody,
I feel like I just want to face the 

2131
01:39:45,871 --> 01:39:46,080
winter.

2132
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:46,741
Those two,
you know,

2133
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:48,360
I think that he had a good night.
They had a,

2134
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:50,730
like I said,
I've fought that camp.

2135
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:51,564
How many times men,
how legitimately if you had to break 

2136
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:54,684
down,
I mean if you went back and looked at 

2137
01:39:56,101 --> 01:39:56,934
tape,
you could probably break down 30 rounds 

2138
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:00,443
with me in that camp.
That means they have all those reads on 

2139
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:06,510
me through the years.
And then cody started out watching me in

2140
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:07,344
junior high,
high school and then the way I look at 

2141
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:13,830
it is he's the one guy who could 
implement it because he looked up to the

2142
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:14,664
guys that wanted to beat me as they are 
the shit so at took down the ego from 

2143
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:23,814
him and allowed him to learn from the 
best guys that I've fought and really 

2144
01:40:27,271 --> 01:40:28,104
taking that information and use it.
Whereas you give a guy like favor or tj 

2145
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:34,290
information and I guarantee you it's in 
linear out the other.

2146
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:35,124
They already know everything.
You don't teach teachers learn a lot 

2147
01:40:37,051 --> 01:40:38,190
from Dwayne.
He is now,

2148
01:40:38,191 --> 01:40:39,024
but I'm talking about then in that camp 
and I think that cody was just like a 

2149
01:40:43,921 --> 01:40:44,754
sponge for these guys because he was 
young and so he came up in that camp as 

2150
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:48,954
a youngster and nothing those guys could
say to them would be wrong and so that 

2151
01:40:52,051 --> 01:40:54,040
made him very with what he's

2152
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,480
doing today and then he's built his 
style to be the champion,

2153
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:59,314
which was me.
I think a big factor in cody's ability 

2154
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:07,240
is also he came to mma from boxing with 
very good hands.

2155
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,190
Yes.
His hands are outstanding.

2156
01:41:09,191 --> 01:41:10,780
Yeah,
but we expected that.

2157
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:11,970
Right.
I'm sure you did that.

2158
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:15,630
I'm just saying that that's a big factor
in his success in MMA period.

2159
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:16,473
Grief is that his boxing was already a 
really high level before you entered 

2160
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:21,250
into mma.
I had a lot of,

2161
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:23,980
I think even more than having boxing at 
a high level.

2162
01:41:23,981 --> 01:41:25,630
It's just a rounds.
Yes,

2163
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:26,890
it's the rounds.
It's the.

2164
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:30,970
It's the experience in the fights more 
than even being good or not like.

2165
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:35,350
He was good obviously,
but he hadn't rounds so he wasn't coming

2166
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:38,180
in green.
He was coming in as a tenant,

2167
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:39,073
as an amateur and then having 10 pro 
fights and so that's 20 and l basically 

2168
01:41:43,391 --> 01:41:44,350
we were,
you know what I mean?

2169
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:46,570
Our,
our tendency as a pro,

2170
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:50,410
he lost some fights as an amateur,
but even then he goes through his losses

2171
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:51,633
as an amateur so they don't affect him 
on his record and so like he's learning 

2172
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:56,974
those things.
Even though your brain is taking the 

2173
01:41:58,511 --> 01:41:59,344
damage,
he still learning things that are going 

2174
01:42:00,941 --> 01:42:04,150
to be added to his pro career that gave 
them experience in,

2175
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:06,460
in the matter,
and that's what the amateur system,

2176
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:08,370
you know,
the amateur is going to create a,

2177
01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:09,493
a different level of up and comers now 
because they're not coming in as their 

2178
01:42:13,871 --> 01:42:14,704
record.
They're coming in as two or three times 

2179
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:17,404
that record if you count there.
That's always the thing that drives me 

2180
01:42:19,301 --> 01:42:21,830
crazy about people that jump right into 
the UFC like you.

2181
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:23,013
Not to pick on cm punk,
but the idea that cm punk with no 

2182
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:29,110
competition experience whatsoever is 
going to fight professionally.

2183
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:31,030
In the biggest organization,
the world,

2184
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:33,760
it's a little offensive.
Really?

2185
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:34,690
Yeah.
Why?

2186
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:35,523
Because here's a guy that has no 
competition experience whatsoever and 

2187
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:38,884
he's going to fight someone who 
legitimately and Micky Gall is a brown 

2188
01:42:41,351 --> 01:42:43,030
belt in Jujitsu.
Very good on the ground,

2189
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:44,470
good standup,
tough kid,

2190
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:46,640
has fought amateur,
has fought professional,

2191
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:49,150
and has a wealth of martial arts 
experience.

2192
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:54,660
It's contrary to everything anyone has 
ever learned about learning and teaching

2193
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:57,670
and getting better.
At martial arts,

2194
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,683
you don't just jump into the deep end of
the pool when you're not some physical 

2195
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:03,130
freak like brock lesnar or something 
like that.

2196
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:03,964
You know,
you're talking about a guy was a good 

2197
01:43:05,381 --> 01:43:06,940
athlete.
I mean cm punk is,

2198
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:09,310
but there's nothing unbelievable about 
them.

2199
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,270
He's not some freak of nature.
So I would think that if this guy really

2200
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:15,670
did want to do this and do it the right 
way,

2201
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:19,450
get them to go through it the right way 
like everybody else would.

2202
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,460
Get them to start at small 
organizations.

2203
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:24,430
Get Him to learn martial arts from 
fault.

2204
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:25,810
Yes.
No,

2205
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,340
no,
I don't think so.

2206
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:28,390
Who's this?
I don't agree.

2207
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,343
Who says,
I think that cm punk is a genius for 

2208
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:34,600
saying,
I can make a million dollars on this and

2209
01:43:34,601 --> 01:43:35,890
go fight.
Somebody that would've made,

2210
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,370
could have,
could have 50,000.

2211
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:43,540
He'd never fought in his life.
I paid $500 to 501st five fights.

2212
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,250
Right?
This is my point.

2213
01:43:45,310 --> 01:43:46,750
This is exactly the point I'm getting 
to.

2214
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:48,340
Right.
He was already famous.

2215
01:43:48,370 --> 01:43:49,203
That's what the fight was for him,
but do you think that it should be 

2216
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:53,890
approached that way?
No.

2217
01:43:53,950 --> 01:43:54,783
No,
but I don't think it's going to keep 

2218
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:56,990
happening.
That's what we're.

2219
01:43:56,991 --> 01:44:00,170
That's what the UFC to an extent is 
promoting.

2220
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:03,200
Right?
Because they're promoting promotion,

2221
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,380
not big.
Who deserves and not how good you are.

2222
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,860
Right?
If you really look at what sells data,

2223
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:10,694
5,000 and freaking Kimbo slice had 
record sales on these weird things and 

2224
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:18,350
it's like,
what sense does that make?

2225
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,880
Is that fair?
Is that right?

2226
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:21,110
No.
Is it selling?

2227
01:44:21,111 --> 01:44:22,490
Yes.
Why aren't people buying it?

2228
01:44:22,491 --> 01:44:23,324
Because they understand it,
but wouldn't you think that once you're 

2229
01:44:25,131 --> 01:44:28,100
already wealthy like cm punk is,
he's already a millionaire?

2230
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,503
Wouldn't you want to do it correctly?
Rather than go for the big cash grab 

2231
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:33,734
that's going to wind up getting your 
face punched in like if he was your 

2232
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:37,640
friend.
Let's put it this way,

2233
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:39,590
he raised my friend.
I know exactly what I tell them.

2234
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:40,623
You've got to learn how to fight.
You got to learn how to fight the right 

2235
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:43,094
way.
You've got to learn how to fight like 

2236
01:44:43,461 --> 01:44:44,294
everybody else does.
Slowly and surely you've got to train 

2237
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:50,180
with the best people in the world and 
learn from your ability up.

2238
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:52,460
Now,
don't pretend you're already there.

2239
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:56,270
Don't jump right into the UFC with a 
mean face on that's fucking crazy.

2240
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:57,103
You're going to get smashed and I,
and I respect you because you said that 

2241
01:44:59,091 --> 01:44:59,924
to Brennan and shop and well Shaw,
who was also an issue of him being a 

2242
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:07,850
very good friend of mine and also 
knowing that to say to a friend,

2243
01:45:07,880 --> 01:45:09,690
you tell the friend the truth.
You don't just.

2244
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:10,573
Yes.
Men and I knew how many times he'd been 

2245
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:12,284
knocked out.
I knew how many times he'd been knocked 

2246
01:45:13,351 --> 01:45:15,240
down a football.
I knew how many times I'd be in,

2247
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:16,093
he had been knocked out in the gym and I
knew he was having issues and I knew he 

2248
01:45:18,741 --> 01:45:19,574
wasn't able to take a punch like it used
to anymore and I also knew that he also 

2249
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:26,900
had a way out with podcasting and he's 
being really successful in it.

2250
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:28,850
And I was.
And he had a foot out the door.

2251
01:45:28,851 --> 01:45:30,110
He already had a foot out the door.

2252
01:45:30,370 --> 01:45:32,030
Yeah.
And that's you being a good friend.

2253
01:45:32,031 --> 01:45:32,864
So all I'm saying is it's proof that you
would say that you're following through 

2254
01:45:36,351 --> 01:45:37,184
with what you know and that that's rare.
And I would never stop cm punk from 

2255
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:40,790
competing.
What I would say is,

2256
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,490
hey man,
have a fucking Jujitsu match.

2257
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:46,040
Have an amateur submission,
grappling match.

2258
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:48,710
Have an amateur kickboxing.
So why do you think he did?

2259
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:49,933
Because he got a fuck load of money and 
because he thought he could do it 

2260
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:54,530
because he's a strong man.
He's got a strong mind.

2261
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,513
He's like one of those straight edge 
guys that thinks he can just get a hard 

2262
01:45:58,221 --> 01:45:59,180
work,
pays off,

2263
01:45:59,181 --> 01:46:00,014
you know,
and just went out there and he's a huge 

2264
01:46:01,341 --> 01:46:02,174
celebrity and he felt like he was just 
going to ride that to a new career in 

2265
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:05,384
the UFC and I'm like,
that's like saying you're just going to 

2266
01:46:08,211 --> 01:46:11,330
jump into Nascar and you've never raised
a car before.

2267
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:14,480
You're just going to wind up dead.
That that being said,

2268
01:46:14,510 --> 01:46:15,343
than the logic,
the only logical thing has to be the 

2269
01:46:17,331 --> 01:46:18,164
money in that district.
One hundred percent money bunny and 

2270
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:22,910
delusion,
delusional thinking.

2271
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:23,773
What's the delusion?
Thinking that he's going to beat a guy 

2272
01:46:24,921 --> 01:46:27,560
like micky gall,
just delusional.

2273
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:30,650
He think he really thought that the more
that you can on it,

2274
01:46:31,220 --> 01:46:32,840
100 percent,
100 percent.

2275
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,330
I think he thought he could beat him.
I think he thought he could look,

2276
01:46:35,331 --> 01:46:36,260
use training,
training.

2277
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:37,113
It wasn't training to lose.
He wasn't trained to be 100 percent 

2278
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:39,764
defensive.
He stepped forward and throw a wild 

2279
01:46:41,511 --> 01:46:42,344
right hand.
He didn't dance around the outside and 

2280
01:46:44,091 --> 01:46:46,160
try to avoid him.
He tried to,

2281
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:49,190
when he stepped towards him and got 
taken down immediately,

2282
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,580
then got mauled,
you know,

2283
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:51,560
I mean you've seen him.
It's like,

2284
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:54,150
you know what it's like when a guy has 
very little ground experience,

2285
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,220
how long it takes before they accident.

2286
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:57,653
I already knew that was going to happen.
Of course knew it was going to happen 

2287
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:00,733
here soon.
As soon as you went to the ground you 

2288
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:02,910
knew exactly what was going to play out.
Right.

2289
01:47:02,911 --> 01:47:03,744
But you said it's almost offensive.
I remember you saying that and it's 

2290
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:06,620
like,
how could,

2291
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,583
like who's who is who.
Is it more offensive to us as the 

2292
01:47:11,131 --> 01:47:11,964
fighters or is it a or is it like.
I don't know if I should be more mad at 

2293
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:19,680
at Mickey Golfer thinking he can do it 
because that's in every single one of us

2294
01:47:19,681 --> 01:47:20,840
to not make it go.
Not Me.

2295
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,510
Sorry.
Sorry.

2296
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:24,060
Yeah.
Is it up to.

2297
01:47:24,090 --> 01:47:27,180
Is it his fault that he believed that he
could do it to an extent.

2298
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:30,360
Does that make them that delusional that
every man on are things that they can go

2299
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:33,930
in there and fight and win?
Or is it the UFC that says,

2300
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:34,943
yeah,
we'll give you this much money and give 

2301
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:37,944
you a paper view and puts you at the top
of it and how much money you can 

2302
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:42,050
generate?

2303
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,530
Well,
it's a great move for the UFC.

2304
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,360
The UFC is like,
look,

2305
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:46,223
hey,
we got this huge superstar and we're 

2306
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:48,114
going to send them in with this fresh 
faced young whipper who was a good 

2307
01:47:51,031 --> 01:47:53,130
fighter,
who's got a really good mouth,

2308
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:55,890
great at talking and he's gonna fuck him
up for sure.

2309
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,960
Like this is great.
And what do they do?

2310
01:47:57,961 --> 01:47:58,794
They made a.
They made a hero at a Mickey Golf and 

2311
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:03,690
then wants to make he goggles Hazel 
Stave Sage Northcutt I think you fucking

2312
01:48:03,691 --> 01:48:04,524
corn.
It's another one.

2313
01:48:04,730 --> 01:48:07,920
And then takes him out too and chokes 
him out and his next fight,

2314
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:11,010
God damn genius.
What he's done is beautiful.

2315
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:14,130
So in a way the UFC has done a beautiful
thing because they go,

2316
01:48:14,131 --> 01:48:15,600
oh,
you think you can fight in the UFC?

2317
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,760
Come on in.
Have a seat,

2318
01:48:17,761 --> 01:48:19,650
can we get you something to drink?
Hey,

2319
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:21,240
come up.
And that being said,

2320
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:22,074
for me,
it's not offensive that cm punk when in 

2321
01:48:25,381 --> 01:48:26,214
there did it.

2322
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:31,370
It's offensive like I guess how,
depending on who you are,

2323
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:35,123
it's like it's not offensive,
but it's crazy how you start to realize 

2324
01:48:38,701 --> 01:48:41,340
in those scenarios that it doesn't 
matter how much time,

2325
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:44,310
skill,
or purpose you put into this craft,

2326
01:48:44,311 --> 01:48:47,280
it matters how famous you are or else 
you don't get paid in a way.

2327
01:48:47,281 --> 01:48:48,050
Yeah,
you're right,

2328
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:50,820
and this is my issue.
It's not.

2329
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:53,790
It's not who's wrong,
who's right,

2330
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:58,170
it's you don't need to train and be the 
best anymore.

2331
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:02,550
In fact,
that has a tiny eensy weensy tiny little

2332
01:49:02,551 --> 01:49:04,200
bit of how you make money.
I see.

2333
01:49:04,201 --> 01:49:08,550
I don't think that's true.
I think that is a factor and that factor

2334
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:10,710
is compounded.
If you're a great shit talker.

2335
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:11,813
The point being conor Mcgregor,
conor mcgregor is not just a fantastic 

2336
01:49:15,631 --> 01:49:19,050
shit talker.
He acts a world class fighter fighting.

2337
01:49:19,051 --> 01:49:19,884
Yeah,
bad motherfucker and he's capable of 

2338
01:49:21,201 --> 01:49:22,740
knocking people out with one shot.
I mean,

2339
01:49:22,741 --> 01:49:27,390
that is something people,
they are so excited to see him.

2340
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:28,224
They're paying money to see him.
He's different when we're talking about 

2341
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:32,660
somebody on a different level than 
seeing.

2342
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,800
Well Rhonda,
when she was in her prime,

2343
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,930
Rhonda,
when she was beating all these women and

2344
01:49:36,931 --> 01:49:39,960
when she was just a flip and people in 
their head and arm barring them,

2345
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:41,063
you people were paying to see not just 
this spectacular figure but also this 

2346
01:49:44,971 --> 01:49:46,680
person who really knew how to fight.
Right?

2347
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:47,291
And it was,
uh,

2348
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:48,010
it was,
it

2349
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,590
was a mixture of that and decent 
matchups too.

2350
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:51,520
Oh,
100 percent.

2351
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:52,353
Well,
also when Rhonda with the female MMA 

2352
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,200
being x,
it's gone through in just a few years,

2353
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:00,034
this fantastic metamorphosis where he's 
seeing women like Valentina Shevchenko 

2354
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,293
that is just an overall well rounded 
worldclass mixed martial arts now girls 

2355
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:09,111
like,
you know,

2356
01:50:09,111 --> 01:50:10,810
rose,
Nama units were coming up.

2357
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:11,883
These,
these MMA fighters that are coming up 

2358
01:50:13,211 --> 01:50:15,940
that are like super talented now and 
everyone's getting better.

2359
01:50:16,180 --> 01:50:17,013
The young people coming into the game 
that have this really comprehensive mma 

2360
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:22,450
game.
Whereas before she was fighting people.

2361
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:25,510
No disrespect to her opponents,
but they were limited.

2362
01:50:25,630 --> 01:50:27,040
They were very limited.
They're striking.

2363
01:50:27,041 --> 01:50:28,720
Maybe it wasn't so good.
They were awkward.

2364
01:50:28,721 --> 01:50:31,090
They weren't that good athletically.
There weren't that strong.

2365
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:31,924
They couldn't last as long.
They couldn't touch her on the ground 

2366
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,330
and she showed she shined in those 
match.

2367
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,253
I guess it's just odd how you can look 
at somebody like paige vanzant and the 

2368
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:42,150
champ,
a young Jay check.

2369
01:50:42,570 --> 01:50:43,403
Then the same way,
right?

2370
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:44,830
Yes.
50 slash 50.

2371
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:45,841
Yes,
sorry.

2372
01:50:45,841 --> 01:50:47,670
It makes the most times,
uh,

2373
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:53,190
that if you really look at the breakdown
of the,

2374
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:54,053
of the weight class,
paige vanzant and the champ are almost 

2375
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,300
equal.
Have equal value if you fight them to an

2376
01:51:00,301 --> 01:51:02,970
extent because of views and who wants to
see who fight.

2377
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:03,893
One was on dancing with the stars,
became a big household for dancing and 

2378
01:51:06,441 --> 01:51:11,340
the dancing with the stars because of 
before dancing with the stars.

2379
01:51:11,341 --> 01:51:12,174
She was already on dancing.
She's like a fucking beautiful 

2380
01:51:13,381 --> 01:51:14,214
cheerleader.
It's just that is the appeal that's 

2381
01:51:16,471 --> 01:51:18,730
making money as my point.
Not just,

2382
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:21,270
she can fight.
She absolutely.

2383
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:23,520
She's beating some great girls in the 
division,

2384
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,250
but if we're talking about young Jay 
check who can fight,

2385
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:27,960
fight,
fight,

2386
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:30,150
put her blood,
sweat,

2387
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:33,720
tears like you see it in her and 
everything about it,

2388
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:37,740
and then paige vanzant who is a a good 
athlete and can fight.

2389
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:40,133
It's crazy.
The money levels that come to the same 

2390
01:51:41,791 --> 01:51:42,624
because one is just that famous and that
a camera perfect compared to the other 

2391
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:50,610
one who was just that good at fighting.
Not that she's not,

2392
01:51:50,670 --> 01:51:52,500
but she's not as good on the cameras.
The other one,

2393
01:51:52,640 --> 01:51:53,473
so it levels everything out and that's 
what's blowing my mind is watching that 

2394
01:51:56,821 --> 01:51:57,654
happen.
Even though the skillset isn't even 

2395
01:51:58,561 --> 01:52:00,180
close to the same,
they're going to make the same money.

2396
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:01,313
Well,
the really scary thing is when the page 

2397
01:52:03,751 --> 01:52:06,570
might make more money,
maybe it's crazy.

2398
01:52:06,571 --> 01:52:08,580
That's what's trippy.
It is kind of trippy,

2399
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:11,970
but it kind of makes sense because it's 
entertainment as well as fighting.

2400
01:52:11,971 --> 01:52:12,804
It's not just a sport.
It's not just who's the best sprinter 

2401
01:52:14,790 --> 01:52:17,200
and that's where I go to.
It doesn't offend you with.

2402
01:52:17,970 --> 01:52:20,160
Well,
it doesn't offend me in that sense.

2403
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:22,380
What offended me was that he,

2404
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:23,443
it didn't offend me that he thought it 
because I felt like someone should have 

2405
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:26,764
told them and it didn't offend me that 
his coach has prepared them for it 

2406
01:52:28,961 --> 01:52:30,160
because his coach is a good friend of 
mine,

2407
01:52:30,161 --> 01:52:32,140
Duke Roufus and what are you going to 
do?

2408
01:52:32,141 --> 01:52:33,640
The guy comes through and wants to learn
how to fight.

2409
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:35,050
You got to throw them in there.

2410
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:37,770
Yeah.
It just itch.

2411
01:52:38,790 --> 01:52:42,060
It should happen the way it happened 
because it's good for everybody to see.

2412
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:45,560
It shouldn't happen the way it happened 
because that's all we were going to see.

2413
01:52:46,610 --> 01:52:47,680
You know what I'm saying?
It wasn't.

2414
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:49,340
It was a mauling.
You remember?

2415
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:53,180
That was Mike Tyson fights where he 
would fight guys and you would just go,

2416
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:56,000
don't blink because this shit is not 
going to last.

2417
01:52:56,210 --> 01:52:57,680
It's kind of like that.
It's like,

2418
01:52:57,681 --> 01:52:59,240
yes,
it's a competition,

2419
01:52:59,241 --> 01:53:01,310
but God damn it.
It's not really,

2420
01:53:01,670 --> 01:53:03,380
you know,
like paige vanzant.

2421
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:06,380
Let's go back to her again.
Who's a very talented girl.

2422
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:08,980
I've got nothing but respect for her.
I think it was really fun.

2423
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,653
It scared the fuck out of me when she 
was getting close to your Nana when she 

2424
01:53:13,221 --> 01:53:14,054
was getting,
like when she was winning fights and 

2425
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:18,320
then she fought rose noma,
Eunice and eunice is like right there.

2426
01:53:18,321 --> 01:53:19,170
Right.
Rosana,

2427
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:23,030
Eunice lost to Carolina Kovacevich 
within a very close fight.

2428
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:25,910
Karolina went on to have a very close 
fight with you on a right.

2429
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:30,800
So rose beats paige vanzant decidedly.
Right.

2430
01:53:30,801 --> 01:53:33,260
She beat her down.
It was a huge performance for her,

2431
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:38,740
but that meant that page was literally 
two steps away from a murderer.

2432
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:40,783
I mean,
you'll wanna look what she did to 

2433
01:53:41,661 --> 01:53:42,560
Jessica Panay.
Look,

2434
01:53:42,561 --> 01:53:43,394
I was just to say that's my home girl.
Like she trades with us at Alliance and 

2435
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:48,520
Jessica is no Slouch,
no slouch,

2436
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:50,420
just she's tough.
That's the other thing.

2437
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:52,490
She's not just like.
I mean she took it.

2438
01:53:52,810 --> 01:53:53,541
She,
yeah,

2439
01:53:53,541 --> 01:53:56,360
she's a tough girl and all these girls 
are tough.

2440
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,550
But when you.

2441
01:53:59,220 --> 01:54:00,053
I don't know,
I was a little off when the girls came 

2442
01:54:01,741 --> 01:54:03,030
in the gym,
especially in alliance.

2443
01:54:03,031 --> 01:54:05,250
We never had women in the gym ever in my
whole career.

2444
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,840
It wasn't like,
it was just like,

2445
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:09,840
it was just like no.
Women were fighting,

2446
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:11,760
you know,
for years.

2447
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,860
Yeah.
When did the women start coming there?

2448
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:16,500
It's been there.
Had been with us like two,

2449
01:54:16,510 --> 01:54:17,343
three years now.
I want to say maybe if that with our 

2450
01:54:21,361 --> 01:54:22,350
camp,
with Eric,

2451
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:25,500
but when they first came I was a little 
off put,

2452
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,930
but the longer they are around,
the more they're like,

2453
01:54:27,931 --> 01:54:30,810
they just,
they're so in the sport.

2454
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:32,550
They're just,
they're like,

2455
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:34,470
their eyes are just like,
uh,

2456
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:36,630
like sponges.
That's the best way I could put it.

2457
01:54:36,631 --> 01:54:40,770
And they're just so hungry to hear and 
they're not just listening.

2458
01:54:40,771 --> 01:54:41,604
They're hearing you.
That's the biggest difference I noticed 

2459
01:54:43,561 --> 01:54:47,730
with the women compared to trying to 
work with men is men don't they listen,

2460
01:54:47,731 --> 01:54:48,540
but they're not hearing you.

2461
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:51,090
They already have their own vision of 
um,

2462
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:51,953
cm punk.
I'm going to go out there and hit him 

2463
01:54:52,771 --> 01:54:54,030
with a right hand and that's going to 
be.

2464
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:59,031
He had that vision and no matter what 
you told cm punk that it wasn't going to

2465
01:54:59,071 --> 01:55:02,730
go that way because you were a 50 time 
world champion and you know what's going

2466
01:55:02,731 --> 01:55:03,480
to happen.
He,

2467
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:05,340
he had that vision and that was at 
women.

2468
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:06,533
You can tell them how it's gonna happen 
and they trust and they listen and they 

2469
01:55:10,890 --> 01:55:11,723
are open and they're willing and when 
you have that and you're teaching 

2470
01:55:15,931 --> 01:55:18,930
somebody something,
that's when you can watch.

2471
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:19,793
Watch this thing grow and that's a huge 
thing with the women that I really have 

2472
01:55:23,191 --> 01:55:24,024
learned being around them is they're 
just so humble in knowing where they're 

2473
01:55:29,581 --> 01:55:31,050
at.
We're in a fight here.

2474
01:55:31,051 --> 01:55:32,760
I need to listen and things could go 
weird.

2475
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,620
Whereas men,
it's like

2476
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,440
built to do this.
This is me.

2477
01:55:37,310 --> 01:55:38,870
This is how I.
I'm a man.

2478
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:41,270
I'm the man.
I could kill anybody on earth.

2479
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:44,190
We're all wired that way.
Ego is that in some

2480
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,790
ways connected to your learning to let 
go.

2481
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:48,943
It's 100 percent my biggest battle and I
didn't mention it because I'm still 

2482
01:55:53,131 --> 01:55:53,964
learning so much about it that I don't 
want to sound too off with my 

2483
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,460
description because I'm not a.
I'm not.

2484
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,730
I haven't completely rover it.
Yeah,

2485
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:05,010
and I haven't mastered.
It's such a hard thing to master,

2486
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:06,533
but when you can let go of the ego,
the ego is just such a horrible thing 

2487
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:11,424
for us.
I mean it,

2488
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,623
it,
it ruined so many things that we could 

2489
01:56:14,731 --> 01:56:15,564
be free from my ego.
Couldn't allow me to make me think that 

2490
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:24,621
I'm above you and that you should have a
two espressos here for me because I'm me

2491
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:25,974
and I should have my water at 80 degrees
and somebody should be giving me a 

2492
01:56:29,221 --> 01:56:30,054
massage and then we get out of here.
I should have my own car pick me up and 

2493
01:56:32,080 --> 01:56:36,360
if I have my own car pick picking me up,
then you know some somebody should be.

2494
01:56:36,360 --> 01:56:37,193
But that's only because I put myself 
above things and the only reason I put 

2495
01:56:39,901 --> 01:56:40,734
myself about things because my ego.
The only reason I make excuses is 

2496
01:56:43,331 --> 01:56:47,940
because my ego forces me to hide what I 
am rather than what happened.

2497
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:51,750
Ego just demolished is everything,
especially in the sport of fighting.

2498
01:56:51,990 --> 01:56:54,000
When you can set your ego aside,
you hear it all the time,

2499
01:56:54,001 --> 01:56:55,530
leave your ego at the door and then 
come.

2500
01:56:55,540 --> 01:56:56,373
That doesn't happen.
Very rare do people leave their ego at 

2501
01:56:58,951 --> 01:56:59,784
the door.
They're keeping track of every 

2502
01:57:00,241 --> 01:57:02,430
submission that happens.
Every takedown,

2503
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:03,533
every punch,
they're fixing their shin guards in the 

2504
01:57:05,911 --> 01:57:06,744
middle of the practice because they're 
getting tired and they don't want that 

2505
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,564
one big kick to land where that one big 
take down the line when they're tired 

2506
01:57:12,180 --> 01:57:15,330
and then it hurts their brain because 
their psychology needs to stop.

2507
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:16,164
I'll take downs in order for their ego 
not to be hurt if it goes on and on and 

2508
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:21,270
on and on.

2509
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:22,103
And Ego is the biggest thing that I 
noticed is the difference with men and 

2510
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:25,650
women.
Now.

2511
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:29,490
Women have it too,
but it's just a different feel.

2512
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:30,150
What,
uh,

2513
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,550
when we got women in the room and men in
the room and how they,

2514
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:34,103
the energies is just interesting.
Do you think that women are better at 

2515
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:42,510
taking instruction from men and maybe 
not as good as taking it from women?

2516
01:57:42,511 --> 01:57:43,344
Do you think that what's going on is 
that the women are conceding that these 

2517
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,114
men are bigger and stronger and more 
experience and so it's easier for them 

2518
01:57:50,881 --> 01:57:51,714
to do a,
but maybe they still have that ego 

2519
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,780
against other women?
Yes.

2520
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:55,913
I mean you pretty much.
I really believed that that is pretty 

2521
01:57:57,991 --> 01:57:58,824
much exactly.
I mean there is a now it doesn't always 

2522
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:01,374
go this way,
but there is a natural flow in the way 

2523
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:05,010
we're built as human beings.

2524
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:09,120
Right?
To where in the past where you know,

2525
01:58:09,121 --> 01:58:11,390
the man is the leader of the household 
data da Da da.

2526
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:14,580
That was the old way of thinking and now
we're getting contemporary and it's like

2527
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:19,640
everybody is equal and as that's come to
pass,

2528
01:58:19,741 --> 01:58:22,590
we've seen women be the biggest hit in 
the world for fighting right now.

2529
01:58:22,591 --> 01:58:23,424
Like their main carding everything and 
they're running stuff and I think that 

2530
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:30,780
that has become so many years in the 
past where you're like,

2531
01:58:30,781 --> 01:58:32,070
all right,
men are the household.

2532
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:34,980
They run everything.
The women had to put their ego aside for

2533
01:58:34,981 --> 01:58:39,060
so long that they learn how to do it.
They had no ego walking into things.

2534
01:58:39,061 --> 01:58:39,894
They just already assumed the worst,
but then it made them so much more open 

2535
01:58:43,721 --> 01:58:45,220
that yeah,
they take instruction.

2536
01:58:45,221 --> 01:58:47,800
I swear they just,
it's just different with women.

2537
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:51,130
Not all of them,
but it's just odd.

2538
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,220
There's,
you have to be in it to really feel it,

2539
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,090
that women just take instruction 
differently in a fight scenario.

2540
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,130
Um,
and that's not what everybody.

2541
01:59:00,131 --> 01:59:03,070
I think that if you're dating the 
fighter or something and you try to help

2542
01:59:03,071 --> 01:59:03,710
them,
it's,

2543
01:59:03,710 --> 01:59:06,430
it's actually never happened.
I've seen that.

2544
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:09,190
So it goes both ways.
I've seen it,

2545
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:10,463
but I've rarely do.
I see two lovers coach together and 

2546
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:16,600
train together and do fine.
Right.

2547
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:19,620
The only odd one that I,
that I've seen work is smiling.

2548
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:20,830
Misha,
Misha,

2549
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:22,270
Misha.
Here's another one.

2550
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:24,400
What will you want,
say a smiley?

2551
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:27,980
Who smile he just fought,
got,

2552
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,460
always got this smiling on the back of 
his head.

2553
01:59:30,520 --> 01:59:32,500
A redhead,

2554
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:33,693
smiling Sam.
Hobbies and LV has girls in his corner 

2555
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:38,920
was every time you know that.
Yeah.

2556
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:40,030
And Him and his girl,
they got,

2557
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:42,340
he was walking into the last fight with 
his kids,

2558
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:45,490
with him and his girl and he's kissing 
her while he's laughing at the end.

2559
01:59:45,491 --> 01:59:46,324
It just,
it blows my mind because everybody has 

2560
01:59:47,501 --> 01:59:49,030
their own system,
you know,

2561
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:49,864
and he's a happy guy.
He seems like he's having a grand old 

2562
01:59:51,881 --> 01:59:55,630
time de who knows,
man,

2563
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:57,970
I don't get it.
But yeah.

2564
01:59:57,971 --> 01:59:58,930
Well Tim,
you know,

2565
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,520
that's the weird thing about people,
right?

2566
02:00:00,521 --> 02:00:02,140
Everyone's got a whole different 
formula.

2567
02:00:02,680 --> 02:00:05,410
It just the whole thing.
All these topics are interesting.

2568
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:06,603
So we're pretty much running out of time
because you've got to head back to San 

2569
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:12,150
Diego,
but I wanted to get back to where you're

2570
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:17,160
at now as far as recovery and what your 
thoughts are about resting and getting,

2571
02:00:17,651 --> 02:00:18,700
getting back to camp.

2572
02:00:18,700 --> 02:00:21,850
And when do you think your feet are 
going to be re raring to go again?

2573
02:00:21,851 --> 02:00:24,550
And all your injuries.
That's pretty much that year.

2574
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:26,980
Just put a good,
a good a bra on my body.

2575
02:00:26,981 --> 02:00:30,760
So I'm just right now I'm just healing.
And then those two are going to fight.

2576
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:32,640
Uh,
I think July.

2577
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:34,870
I don't know,
I think it's still a July fourth card.

2578
02:00:34,871 --> 02:00:35,704
Is that what it is?
The July weekend or say I don't really 

2579
02:00:38,201 --> 02:00:39,840
know,
but I don't know the exact date.

2580
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:40,683
That's the big weekend.
That July fourth weekend is always a 

2581
02:00:43,001 --> 02:00:44,940
huge weekend for the UFC and I

2582
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:45,870
think,
uh,

2583
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:49,650
those to a fight on that card.
And then I'd like to winter that.

2584
02:00:49,651 --> 02:00:50,484
I'd like to come back and fight,
fight for the belt and put on another 

2585
02:00:53,161 --> 02:00:53,791
good show.
I mean,

2586
02:00:53,791 --> 02:00:57,510
regardless,
that show was great and you know,

2587
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:00,360
just to touch on that fight one more 
time.

2588
02:01:00,361 --> 02:01:02,670
What was going through my head that 
changed things?

2589
02:01:02,671 --> 02:01:04,740
You know,
I hear a lot about what people,

2590
02:01:04,741 --> 02:01:06,210
all he was a,
he didn't look the same.

2591
02:01:06,211 --> 02:01:06,751
He,
this,

2592
02:01:06,751 --> 02:01:07,584
he that and it's like there's some 
things that I want to clarify that 

2593
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:13,560
unless you're a professional fighter and
you're in that zone,

2594
02:01:13,561 --> 02:01:15,540
you don't really understand.
And that was the,

2595
02:01:15,600 --> 02:01:16,433
the,
the way that I approached the fight was 

2596
02:01:19,291 --> 02:01:21,390
a little different in this one than 
you've seen in the past.

2597
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:24,360
For the first two rounds it was,
it was pretty good.

2598
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:26,430
It was back and forth,
me and me and cody was,

2599
02:01:26,460 --> 02:01:27,293
it was like,
it was a competitive match up coming 

2600
02:01:29,161 --> 02:01:29,610
into third.

2601
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:32,250
I get cut.
And when you get what he did,

2602
02:01:32,251 --> 02:01:34,830
he hit you with a kick.
It was a kick or a headbutt.

2603
02:01:34,831 --> 02:01:35,490
And then,
uh,

2604
02:01:35,490 --> 02:01:37,530
I don't know,
but it doesn't matter.

2605
02:01:37,531 --> 02:01:40,490
We're going to say it was a kid who 
cares about kick got me,

2606
02:01:40,780 --> 02:01:41,613
caught me right here in my eyebrow.
And I remember I got cut and I remember 

2607
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:45,923
it started bleeding and it wasn't the 
blood that bothered me as much as know 

2608
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:51,890
as the doctor.
That's when,

2609
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,233
if you're me and you're not.
And I think about everything that's 

2610
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:57,440
going on and I'm adjusting.
It's like,

2611
02:01:57,441 --> 02:01:58,460
all right,
the doctors in here,

2612
02:01:58,461 --> 02:01:59,850
this cut is bad.
I mean,

2613
02:01:59,860 --> 02:02:01,820
and the way they were talking to me,
are you okay?

2614
02:02:01,821 --> 02:02:02,750
How's it look?
And I'm like,

2615
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:03,613
Oh shit,
they're going to stop this fight like 

2616
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:08,300
this ever.
And when I heard the cow crowd reaction,

2617
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,220
Ooh,
like when they saw,

2618
02:02:10,221 --> 02:02:11,900
when they showed it,
I was like,

2619
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:13,370
crap,
they might stop this fight.

2620
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:14,233
So this is the third round,
I got to go after it for the in the 

2621
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:20,210
fourth,
like there's no other,

2622
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:22,880
it's not just,
it's no longer fighting smart.

2623
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:24,980
It's no longer fighting smart.
After I got cut,

2624
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,440
the third round is lost for me right 
when you get cut,

2625
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:28,363
that's it.
Chances of me winning that or I have to 

2626
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:33,560
drop them or take them down and hold 
them down and then maybe I could win.

2627
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:35,001
But the,
the,

2628
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:38,720
the cut is a deciding factor as an 
athlete that you have to make a choice.

2629
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:39,673
Am I all in or am I going to play safe?
And I was all in once I got cut because 

2630
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:44,930
I already lost on the score cards in my 
mind.

2631
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:46,770
Once you get cut,
you're down on,

2632
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,800
on the bleeding and the damage,
they're going to see that.

2633
02:02:48,801 --> 02:02:49,634
And that's it.
It's not either cut him or put them out 

2634
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:53,270
or keep them down on the mat.

2635
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:55,310
That was the goal.
From then on,

2636
02:02:55,311 --> 02:02:58,070
after that cut,
it was no longer stick move,

2637
02:02:58,430 --> 02:03:00,080
uh,
go to the weak side.

2638
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:03,050
Go to the strong side time.
This time that it's,

2639
02:03:03,630 --> 02:03:06,110
you got to kill this dude or else you're
gonna lose a decision.

2640
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:07,363
That's it and that's why you saw 
different me in the fourth and that's 

2641
02:03:12,471 --> 02:03:13,304
what,
that's where the big mistake wasn't me 

2642
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:17,150
getting put down on my butt a couple 
times in one round and getting a 10,

2643
02:03:17,151 --> 02:03:20,420
eight round and then.
But at that point with the cut,

2644
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:21,283
let's say I take it safe,
let's say I get cut and I play it safe 

2645
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:27,650
like I had been doing the chances that 
the doctor would stop it were high,

2646
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:31,070
he could go play it safe so it doesn't 
cut my eye open worse,

2647
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:32,510
right?
Stick move.

2648
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,190
Just stay safe.
No,

2649
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:36,320
it's like to just go for it.

2650
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,910
Like I'm all in.
I'm in the fight.

2651
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:38,773
That's what I was feeling at that time 
and that's what can't be read on the 

2652
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:42,554
outside of a fight is what a fighter's 
feeling when I'm feeling is they might 

2653
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:48,500
stop this fight because of this cut.
So you either got to take them out,

2654
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:49,603
take them down or cut him back.
And so that was the focus and when that 

2655
02:03:53,031 --> 02:03:53,864
happened I went all in and then that 
created the openings that he needed to 

2656
02:03:56,901 --> 02:04:00,080
be successful in his game plan.
And that was it.

2657
02:04:00,081 --> 02:04:03,050
So fifth round I knew I had to take them
out.

2658
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:04,183
I mean I won the fifth round,
who wins the fifth round after losing 

2659
02:04:06,620 --> 02:04:08,720
after getting put on there.
But a couple of times,

2660
02:04:08,721 --> 02:04:09,554
not very many people.
So it's a matter of that fight can go 

2661
02:04:12,741 --> 02:04:15,020
different.
I have the tools,

2662
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:17,210
the skillset,
the cardio,

2663
02:04:17,211 --> 02:04:19,100
everything.
It takes a little bit of health,

2664
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:22,910
some adjustments and everything's fine.
This is a game of inches.

2665
02:04:22,911 --> 02:04:24,530
So that's how I feel about it.
I'm not,

2666
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
I'm not discouraged by that.
As much as I feel like I'm growing,

2667
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:31,400
I can grow from it.
It's also a massive challenge.

2668
02:04:31,401 --> 02:04:34,460
Now that you know that you've faced a 
god that can beat you like that.

2669
02:04:34,461 --> 02:04:37,840
And now that massive challenge will 
certainly burn a fire inside of you.

2670
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:39,113
You don't.
You shouldn't need that to burn a fire 

2671
02:04:40,451 --> 02:04:41,284
inside of you.
You don't think it gives you more 

2672
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:45,010
motivation.
If losing makes you.

2673
02:04:45,460 --> 02:04:46,293
For me,
if losing changes to how you approach 

2674
02:04:49,001 --> 02:04:50,920
something,
then it weighs more than winning.

2675
02:04:51,160 --> 02:04:52,600
Does that mean that the.
Well,

2676
02:04:52,601 --> 02:04:54,130
okay,
I see what you're saying and I said that

2677
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,020
they should.
I don't.

2678
02:04:57,090 --> 02:04:59,140
You got to be who you are.
Winning and losing.

2679
02:04:59,141 --> 02:04:59,974
You can't let that decide.
Now if I don't have the drive to go win 

2680
02:05:02,891 --> 02:05:05,260
a world title without winning or losing 
and what am I doing?

2681
02:05:05,410 --> 02:05:07,570
Right.
So that's not the right way to think and

2682
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:09,680
part of your new mindset.
No,

2683
02:05:09,690 --> 02:05:10,750
this is life.
Right?

2684
02:05:10,751 --> 02:05:13,720
But this is a part of your new mindset.
New that I've always had this.

2685
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:15,850
I mean it's been,
it's gotten.

2686
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:17,890
I've gotten better at accepting it.
Yes.

2687
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:20,560
With,
with losing control of things that I can

2688
02:05:20,561 --> 02:05:20,920
control.

2689
02:05:20,920 --> 02:05:23,590
Yes,
but I've always thought that way can't.

2690
02:05:24,370 --> 02:05:25,203
How do I make it so winning and losing 
are equal because I don't want it to 

2691
02:05:27,041 --> 02:05:28,180
change me.
Even if I lose,

2692
02:05:28,181 --> 02:05:31,720
I need to still be the person that I 
tell everybody I am winning and losing.

2693
02:05:31,721 --> 02:05:32,554
You have to be what you are.
You can't change because it didn't go 

2694
02:05:34,361 --> 02:05:35,194
your way,
so I don't think I need that last to be 

2695
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,364
driven.
I was driven and thought I was going to 

2696
02:05:40,751 --> 02:05:42,820
win that fight as much as ever before 
that fight.

2697
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:45,790
I'm as driven and as good as I always 
was.

2698
02:05:45,791 --> 02:05:46,624
Now after the loss,
it's just a matter of making 

2699
02:05:48,851 --> 02:05:51,310
adjustments,
not burning desire,

2700
02:05:51,330 --> 02:05:54,220
just another challenge,
not burning desire to burning desire.

2701
02:05:54,221 --> 02:05:57,520
If you don't have that in all times and 
get out because you're gonna get hurt.

2702
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:58,973
So how much time.
So if we're talking with them fighting 

2703
02:06:02,011 --> 02:06:03,450
in July,
we're talking right now.

2704
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:04,284
It is now February.
So if they fight in July then you're 

2705
02:06:07,021 --> 02:06:08,880
likely looking at somewhere around 
December,

2706
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:09,420
somewhere like that.

2707
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:13,230
That perhaps depending on if I do one 
fight this year,

2708
02:06:13,350 --> 02:06:15,090
okay.
And Go back and live my title.

2709
02:06:15,091 --> 02:06:15,924
Okay.
And then defended and another three 

2710
02:06:16,771 --> 02:06:18,570
times in one year.
Okay.

2711
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:19,800
If I,
you know,

2712
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:23,970
I mean these guys are going to fight.
There's going to be a winner.

2713
02:06:23,971 --> 02:06:27,780
People want to see me fight them.
I really believe that one of these guys.

2714
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:28,614
So what am I in a rush for other than 
getting healthy and healing and putting 

2715
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:34,170
on a good show and fight these guys,
they want to fight me.

2716
02:06:34,171 --> 02:06:35,850
I'll tell you that.
Both of them.

2717
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:37,093
So what's.
What's the rest other than being 

2718
02:06:39,811 --> 02:06:41,670
perfectly healthy so I can put that show
on.

2719
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:44,790
I fought three times last year.
Cody sat on the outside,

2720
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:46,740
fought at three round fight,
came in and fought me.

2721
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:47,903
I fought three titles,
thought for three titles against the 

2722
02:06:49,771 --> 02:06:50,604
best guys in the world.

2723
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:51,613
I would like to see how he can do.
Let's see if he can keep a wind street 

2724
02:06:55,771 --> 02:06:57,930
going.
Let's see if he can keep the belt at all

2725
02:06:58,140 --> 02:07:01,020
against the guy that I already fought.
And let's see if Tj,

2726
02:07:01,050 --> 02:07:03,240
what Tj can do with,
with this opportunity.

2727
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,480
This is the thing.
I don't mind seeing what these gentlemen

2728
02:07:06,481 --> 02:07:07,314
can do with it because I fought them 
both and I know what it takes to be the 

2729
02:07:10,381 --> 02:07:11,214
best for a very long time.
Not just for one fight and I'm not sure 

2730
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:16,044
if they have what it takes yet,
but I'm here and I liked the challenge 

2731
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:21,300
to find out and I like to challenge them
again to find out.

2732
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:23,410
Donald Cruz has been a pleasure,
man.

2733
02:07:23,411 --> 02:07:24,750
I really appreciate you coming down,
man.

2734
02:07:24,760 --> 02:07:26,980
That was awesome.
Good time and I'm really looking forward

2735
02:07:26,981 --> 02:07:29,170
to seeing you back in there again.
I'm really looking forward to you and me

2736
02:07:29,171 --> 02:07:32,110
doing commentary March 4th.
No time soon.

2737
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:33,023
Thanks everybody.
We'll be back tomorrow with a Philip 

2738
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:36,100
DEFRANCO.

2739
02:07:36,100 --> 02:07:36,933
See you then.
