1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
And boom,
Danielle liberal friend here we go to 

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:08,370
the love and I am loving rather I should
say,

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,650
your new podcast,
history on fire.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,760
And it's just wonderful to hear your 
soul tree Italian accent,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,680
a waxing politically on the past.
That's because,

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,680
uh,
I just never learned to speak English.

7
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:24,090
Right?
But you do speak.

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:27,600
It's very confusing to me because you do
speak perfect English.

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:29,460
You understand it,
you're very articulate.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,640
Your choice of words is excellent,
but it comes out like,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,560
how come I can do that?
But you can't do that.

12
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:41,490
Can you try to talk like me if you can 
believe it?

13
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:45,490
I think I do half of the time I'm like,
what accent?

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,700
English.
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,790
I have a horrible year for racks.
I just don't tear it.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't hear it.
You know,

17
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,120
when I hear my recording that I go back,
I'm like,

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,800
Jesus Christ,
I really speak like that.

19
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,920
But you know what?
A bulky.

20
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,660
Right now you're in my own voicemail.
No,

21
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,930
perfect.
There's no accident data is one of the 

22
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,031
great things about doing a podcast is 
that it forces you to listen to your 

23
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:08,031
side.
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:12,370
Yeah.
And you can learn a lot about how you 

25
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:12,370
sound.
Yep.

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:12,370
You know,
you really can't.

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,830
You learn a lot about little things you 
do like,

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,240
like the word,
like hats.

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,100
That's one thing people say like fucking
way too off a lot.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,090
That's a real problem.
That word like,

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,890
like I've tried to shorten it or to 
eliminate it,

32
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,510
but it fucking creeps its way in like,
you know,

33
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,050
man,
like it's like this guy like it.

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,200
Some people in the problem is if I 
fixate on it,

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
if I fixate on someone saying it like 
then it breaks me.

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
Then I have same thing I was talking 
with some guy was really smart and 

37
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:45,890
really brilliant.

38
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:45,890
They kept saying,
you know,

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,780
every four wards,
and I could not follow the conversation 

40
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,350
where he was making great points too,
so I was missing out because they're 

41
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,350
psychos.
Like,

42
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,350
oh no,
no,

43
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,540
no.
You know,

44
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,590
it's like a fuck.
You go away.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,230
It's a tech.
It gets a,

46
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,070
it's a,
a speech pattern.

47
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,310
It's basically a version of a 
[inaudible] or A.

48
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,900
I've always said that that's what people
do with the word fuck.

49
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:12,870
Sometimes it's a.
it's a use of the word fuck this fucking

50
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,910
guy with this fucking thing.
The fucking.

51
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

52
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,880
It's a filler.
Yeah.

53
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,840
That's why I'm super impressed with 
people like Sam Harris that talk with no

54
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,750
filler.
They just just that on from.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,430
I don't.
My brain doesn't work like that.

56
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm always scrambling for certain words 
or trying to wonder if I was.

57
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,630
My vocabulary was better.
Maybe I would be less likely to use 

58
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,730
fillers,
but I dunno.

59
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,770
I think he's like,
dude in conversation sometimes you 

60
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:42,960
needed that Mike.
It'll mess up big to just see,

61
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,610
okay,
where do I want to go to wait to next?

62
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:49,611
You know,
but you don't want to leave an awkward 

63
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:49,611
pose a car,
like throwing something out there.

64
00:02:49,611 --> 00:02:51,390
Just go through the dcs wherever you 
want to go next.

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,520
Can you also don't want someone to like 
jump in thinking you want them to talk 

66
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:00,010
and like you're in the middle of trying 
to form the sentence and if

67
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,290
they do jump in then you'll totally lose
it.

68
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,930
So you want to,
um,

69
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,390
just to let them know I'm thing is a 
instead of just going,

70
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,590
I've had.
Yeah,

71
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,330
exactly.
And that everybody at least painful that

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,340
way because you don't normally,
you give a two and suppose between 

73
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,120
somebody starting in somebody's 
beginning of the next conversation,

74
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,960
he,
there's no posts.

75
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,961
Everybody's just there waiting for you 
to not stop but slow down so that they 

76
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:30,910
can jump in at that age.
Did you see people take a deep breath?

77
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,911
Kind of like Jesus mad.
It's like it's a full contact sport 

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,680
talking to somebody.
It's just your language is so,

79
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,330
uh,
it's so poetic.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,650
It's a flowing.
Yeah,

81
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,270
yeah,
yeah.

82
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,970
Beautiful language that fat is great for
English.

83
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:51,010
Language is also make sure we're not at 
all an empire.

84
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,510
Right?
Is like you tell people,

85
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,460
do this,
get stuff done.

86
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,780
You know,
it's very to the point,

87
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,100
it's weak.
It's to the point,

88
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,100
it's great.
Italian is great for flowery.

89
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,550
Oh Sweetheart,
look at the beautiful bone out there 

90
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,070
kind of thing where you just wait,
you said 10,000

91
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,500
words to really say something that could
have been saving five,

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,790
but it's the vibe that you create that.
Yeah,

93
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,650
there's a lot of work,
but it's flowing.

94
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,320
Yep.
It's like wine and poetry.

95
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,190
It's like,
Whoa,

96
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,300
it's got this sort of.
Whereas American is just like,

97
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,410
Hey,
what's up?

98
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:26,460
Fuck face.
It's no,

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,660
and I was starting to write in English.
It was so damn hard for me because I was

100
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:35,870
so used to these long flowy sentence.
That's like De de,

101
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,280
De,
De,

102
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:36,740
De,
De,

103
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:36,990
De,
De,

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,400
de,
De,

105
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,970
de.
There was these right?

106
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,120
Very musical.
And you know,

107
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,630
any sentence that I would write like 
that in English,

108
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,070
I lose half of the readers within three 
seconds because that's too many words.

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,060
Get to the point,
you know,

110
00:04:49,061 --> 00:04:50,830
what are you trying to say?
And so it's like,

111
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,610
and I taught English sucks.
There's no boy.

112
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,430
There's a reality that is,
you know,

113
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,540
there are ways to express yourself 
beautifully,

114
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,800
but it's different.
You need to definitely toned down the 

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
line of the sentences a little shorter.
There are ways to do it,

116
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,190
stealing it,
but for the way,

117
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,270
but he's completely different.
What about the attention spans of people

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,740
in Italy versus the people in America?
Because the,

119
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,910
the Italian attention span seems to be 
much longer.

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,590
There is some of that,
I don't know if he's still through a,

121
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,600
I don't know if it's a genetic thing or 
not because I go to their back on 

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,471
vacation so I don't have the pulse of 
the situation anymore the way he used 

123
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:28,471
to.
Um,

124
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:33,000
he may be a generational thing.
He was that way certainly when I was 

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,751
growing up,
but there was clearly more attention 

126
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:36,751
span.

127
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,480
But then again that was before a 
thousand sinks that we'll use to 

128
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,860
distract ourselves time where it's like 
somebody's sticking to you,

129
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,540
but I'm like,
ah,

130
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,630
let me send this email.
Well,

131
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:43,960
yeah,
yeah.

132
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:44,890
That's great.
Good point.

133
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:46,720
But you're doing something else at the 
same time.

134
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,340
Well,
correct me if I'm wrong,

135
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,430
but like a classical Italian meal,
like in a,

136
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,190
in a restaurant,
like you would sit there for hours.

137
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,440
Yeah.
It's not like America where you're in 

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,440
and out in 40 now.
Definitely.

139
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Yeah.
There's much more of these as low pace 

140
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,520
and a creeping me out the other day.
Um,

141
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,580
whole body.
Marco's give me a call and within about 

142
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,050
a minute I was sinking and I,
I love ovarian,

143
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,640
but the vibe for me was like,
okay,

144
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,720
great.
Hi.

145
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,740
Hi.
What's up now?

146
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:20,741
What do you want?
And then I realized that he wasn't 

147
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:20,741
calling because he wanted anything.

148
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,280
He just wanted to say what's up and 
chat.

149
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,870
And I was like,
oh,

150
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,570
I forgot what it's like to be that way.
It's nice.

151
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,540
I liked it,
you know,

152
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,090
that's a good feeling.
Good.

153
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:34,091
Or You just,
we're just talking because we like to 

154
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:34,091
talk to each other.
It's not like,

155
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:34,340
hey,
I need something or you know,

156
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:39,341
uh,
I'm so used to that conversation now 

157
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:42,611
that everything is for a reason.
It's like we're trying to get stuff 

158
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:42,640
done.
And uh,

159
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,190
it was so refreshing as feeding,
this is beautiful.

160
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,400
I love it.
I miss it.

161
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,160
That's how it should be.
It's nice if you can catch someone 

162
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,450
that's on the same vibe,
but when you're like,

163
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,740
hey man,
everything good?

164
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,340
What's going on?
Yeah,

165
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,960
yeah.
I'm just getting some shit done.

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,740
What's up?
What's up?

167
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,800
What's up?
I just called to say hello like well hi.

168
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:03,870
Bye.

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
GotTa go.
I'm running an empire running the empire

170
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:10,850
of Mike and I mean we do.
We do have a,

171
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,790
I don't know how he got that way,
but we do have intense busy lives.

172
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:18,320
So sometime that organic or relax.
So let's hang out.

173
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,350
Let's see.
Let's things transpire and play half of 

174
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,050
the time it's like,
okay,

175
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:26,660
it's known at one.
I need to be out of here.

176
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,960
This is my fun time.
So it's 1215 motherfucker.

177
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,270
I'm not having fun yet making it fun 
right now because I need to.

178
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,300
It's like you can do that too.
I was listening to this Ted talk on the 

179
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:42,110
nature of happiness and I forget the,
the gentleman who was doing the speaking

180
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,540
but he was um,
he uh,

181
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,170
was.
He had developed an APP and in the APP,

182
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,500
uh,
it would like hit you with reminders and

183
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,630
ask you questions like what are you 
doing right now?

184
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,080
Are you enjoying what you're doing right
now is just what you want to do?

185
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:02,290
And like things along those lines.
And then they would gather data and so 

186
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,850
they,
they added all their data from all the 

187
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,421
people that use the APP and one of the 
things they found was one of the least 

188
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:07,430
conducive things to happiness.
One of the,

189
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:12,431
one of the indicators that people are 
not happy is when your mind is 

190
00:08:12,431 --> 00:08:13,940
wandering,
like you just sitting around thinking of

191
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,890
nothing,
just sitting and doing nothing.

192
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,670
And in those moments,
for whatever reason,

193
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,160
people just don't feel good,
right?

194
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,270
They,
their mind will wander to the negative 

195
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,770
things,
but when you're in the moment and you're

196
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:32,771
occupied in something,
whether you're creating something or 

197
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:32,771
whether you're writing something or 
whatever you're doing,

198
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,110
like those are the moments where people 
feel fulfilled and happy.

199
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,870
No,
definitely in there something to be said

200
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:42,620
for meditation in that regard of 
learning to be in the moment when,

201
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:47,650
because you know a lot of the times we 
can be in the moment when we're doing 

202
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,591
something,
but to be in the moment when you're not 

203
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:50,591
doing something,
just like,

204
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:51,640
let me take a deep breath,
let's be.

205
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,700
Or let's look around.
That's not as easy to do as weird thing.

206
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,910
Yeah.

207
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,120
That's why like our class,
whether it's a martial arts class or a 

208
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,081
yoga class is really good for people 
because someone's telling you what to 

209
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:05,081
do.
Like,

210
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:09,491
okay,
now we're going to work on armbars from 

211
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:09,491
the mount.
You know,

212
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:09,491
I could get to the mount.
Okay.

213
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:13,721
Shift your hips to the left,
grab the arm pit and Diane and in going 

214
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:17,141
through those steps you have forced to 
concentrate on that thing and because 

215
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,920
it's so intense,
you're forced to be in that moment and 

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,940
that for a lot of people is a real.
Not just the physical relief of 

217
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,110
exercise,
which is fantastic for the mind,

218
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,350
but the relief of focus and 
concentration alleviates a lot of the 

219
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,241
bullshit that is like,
that builds up when the mind is 

220
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:37,241
wandering time.

221
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:42,020
I notice when I do get to,
I finally had a chance to start rolling 

222
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,850
again the last month or two,
if that's all fucking good.

223
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,950
Oh my God.
I forgot.

224
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,420
Not only physically,
as you say,

225
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,030
I'll go to fields,
but in that moment,

226
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,550
you know if your mind wanders too much,
the guy's choking.

227
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,350
You guys aren't buying or you can't 
wander.

228
00:09:55,351 --> 00:10:00,351
You have to be totally present in what 
you're doing and he is just such a 

229
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:05,781
mental break that I thought I had all 
these issues when I walk into class and 

230
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:08,160
I walk out of those problems,
you call it those problems.

231
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:09,210
That's a joke.
Come on.

232
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,430
Big Deal because suddenly you have 
lightened up.

233
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:16,431
You'll go read of this heavy load they 
are carrying and there's nothing like 

234
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:16,440
it.
You know,

235
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:20,040
something that puts you in the moment,
but also your body puts your body,

236
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,210
your mind,
everything.

237
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,480
The gift of perspective.
Yep.

238
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,710
Yeah,
and some people get it from running,

239
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,410
you know,
I know,

240
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,970
I know some people they just love or 
like running hills

241
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,980
especially,
you know,

242
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,210
because it's just so difficult and then 
when when you reach the top of that 

243
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,580
hill,
you have a milestone,

244
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,950
you hit that milestone to get to that 
hill and just whatever it is that effort

245
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,070
of doing that,
which is very intensive,

246
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,080
very difficult just when it's over,
just everything else seems like relaxed 

247
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,990
bake time.
Even weights.

248
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,620
Yeah,
sure.

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,390
Anything,
anything.

250
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,940
Just do something that you have to 
concentrate on.

251
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,860
You know,
like if you're lifting something heavy,

252
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,800
like if you're trying to bench press or 
squat or something like that,

253
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:05,710
like while you're doing that,
that is what you're concentrating on.

254
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,610
Amazing though,
that that's what the mind needs 

255
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,941
sometimes just one primary singular 
thing to focus on and to focus on an 

256
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,210
intensely and it's almost cleansing in a
way.

257
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,970
Forces the pipes.

258
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,310
Yeah.
It's kind of like when you have insects 

259
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,331
for too long and then you'd wait that 
suddenly everything in your brain 

260
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:27,430
switches.
It's like,

261
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,150
oh,
this shit that I felt I had on me or 

262
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,281
this tension,
all this stuff that I felt were real 

263
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,501
problems.
You just haven't had sex for too many 

264
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:37,630
days in a row.
Haven't had sex for a long time.

265
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,790
Yeah.
I thought you were saying you've had sex

266
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:44,791
for too long.
I was like know such and such a thing as

267
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,800
doing some sessions,
some session work Myra.

268
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,790
Yeah,
but that's good.

269
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,930
Fuck people up,
man.

270
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,550
I mean,
I,

271
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:54,190
I,
I

272
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,970
to this day think that that is,
especially for men,

273
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,360
the primary reason why a lot of men 
exhibit like really pathetic behavior 

274
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,690
because they are trying so hard to get 
women to like them and nothing is 

275
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,741
working and so they have fallen into 
this trap of becoming this like she male

276
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,770
thing this,
this like super feminist,

277
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,040
sort of always a identifying with 
women's issues and trying to get women 

278
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:25,930
on your side and it doesn't fucking 
work.

279
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:27,640
No,
like Dave Rubin,

280
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,440
a guy was on the podcast the other day.
He,

281
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,730
uh,
by the way,

282
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
great guy,
great podcast.

283
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:37,201
Had a great time with them,
but he tweeted something the other day 

284
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:39,190
and it was a billboard that some poor 
fool had put up and it said,

285
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,430
dear women,
on behalf of all men,

286
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm sorry.
She's right.

287
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,540
That the ps two died would be.
I'm really trying to get laid,

288
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,350
really trying so hard at me with someone
touched my deck.

289
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,610
Yeah,
police.

290
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,670
That would have been more honest.
You have to just put that on the 

291
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,670
billboard is like with the number at the
ad is like,

292
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,710
Oh,
poor guy.

293
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,140
I got it.
Yeah.

294
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,150
I mean it's like,
not that there's anything wrong with 

295
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,660
siding with women if you agree that 
they'd been fucked over or looking at 

296
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,920
for them out for them or you know,
and sympathizing or empathizing.

297
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,050
That's not the point.
It's just the behavior.

298
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,190
It's.
And it's also an anti masculine behavior

299
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,270
and anti male behavior.
Maybe it's because they identify,

300
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
they identify those,
those characteristics with bullies or 

301
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,290
people that were mean to them or people 
that you know,

302
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,140
caused them pain or frustration,
but it's also like this.

303
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,540
It's traitorous.
You know what I mean?

304
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:42,541
It's like you're a gender traitor,
like in some ways to me there's that 

305
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,580
bullshit dichotomy there where you have 
the strong natural asshole that was 

306
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,360
older soul kind of doesn't care about 
anybody's feeling.

307
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,370
Some days by your strong that's the good
side or use to sweet little sensitive,

308
00:13:56,891 --> 00:14:01,891
but if you say you go,
Hi Dina color and I run and he's like 

309
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:04,740
both them all data suck.
Neither one is a desirable way to beat 

310
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,000
you in.
The problem is that in trying to get rid

311
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:12,001
of the acid male side,
people who have also gotten rid of the 

312
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:12,910
good stuff about being a man about this 
thing,

313
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,800
that it.
There'll be a nation,

314
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,820
the stereotypical masculine quality and 
it's like,

315
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,860
that's not what we're trying to get rid 
of.

316
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,480
That's the good stuff.
You want to keep that.

317
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,840
You want to get rid of.
You know the 79.

318
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,960
It's gender role.
I'm the man I was lucky around and go 

319
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:27,960
back into the kitchen kind of thing.
Yeah,

320
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
I can see how that would be less than 
ideal,

321
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,410
but they get the lead off.
That doesn't mean get rid of the good 

322
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,890
stuff at all.
Exactly the term.

323
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:38,530
Have you heard the term toxic toxic 
masculinity?

324
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,890
That's an adorable term,
but like social justice warriors or 

325
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,311
throw around toxic masculinity and the 
real problem with men adopting this idea

326
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,070
is that they ignore the negative things 
that women have

327
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,920
done because it's not about women.
It's not about men.

328
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,770
It's about nice people.
That's really what it is.

329
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:02,771
I mean there's feminine qualities that 
are beautiful and there's male masculine

330
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:04,100
qualities that are beautiful and 
there's,

331
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,430
there's,
there's people on both sides that are 

332
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,951
out of their fucking mind and bat shit 
crazy and to side with women on every 

333
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:12,890
occasion.
Just because you're a man,

334
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,700
you're saying,
I'm sorry for all men before we.

335
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,630
And my apologies.
That's weak shit.

336
00:15:17,631 --> 00:15:19,280
You know what you're doing.
You need to run hills,

337
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,990
okay,
you need to go to class,

338
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,650
take a yoga class to something but 
hadn't gotten laid or get someone to 

339
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:26,650
touch you.

340
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,940
And it's funny cause when you don't come
from a place of need,

341
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,260
suddenly we may like you paying times as
much as before.

342
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,060
There was a period where I did not,
it wasn't running anymore on the typical

343
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,130
script that I've had for most of my life
where it's like,

344
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,160
Whoa,
I want your attention.

345
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,420
Look at that one time thing for me.
Yeah,

346
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,470
there was a period where seeing sap,
but either way where I didn't care.

347
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,200
I'm just like,
if we haven't got.

348
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,930
I haven't got with [inaudible] I'm happy
to,

349
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
but I don't want.
Yeah,

350
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,120
you are beautiful lawn.
That's great,

351
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,350
but I don't want anything from you.
And of course the second,

352
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,370
but my brain switched awake suddenly 
been like 10 times more than before and 

353
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,600
he was like,
okay,

354
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,330
that works.
That's amazing,

355
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,260
isn't it?
It's,

356
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,650
but there's something about being 
comfortable in your own skin and just 

357
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,701
know constantly acting because you're 
trying to impress somebody or you want 

358
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,570
somebody to.
Whether it's sex,

359
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:19,940
whether it is attention,
whether whatever that may be because you

360
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,470
want something from them.
It's like,

361
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,680
this is why I am.
You dig it.

362
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,600
You dig it.
You don't.

363
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,320
You don't.
I'm still comfortable with who I am.

364
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,530
It makes such a difference when people,
whether today too.

365
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,660
I think also the,
regardless of the words that you choose 

366
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,620
and the way that you say them in the 
sentences that you structure,

367
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,920
I think people can feel intent and they 
can just something about it.

368
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:48,111
There's an intangible quality to a needy
person that even if they do say the 

369
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:49,290
right things and do it in the right 
order,

370
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,140
you know,
some women or some manner like fucking,

371
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,150
you know,
not this,

372
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,180
not this dude.
That's why you can read all the books 

373
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,510
into wired about the stuff you say.

374
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,710
That's barely half of the game.
You know,

375
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,860
there's a,
it's who you are is not what you say,

376
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,050
what the image you put.
Even because it's painful,

377
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:14,051
you have to constantly keep up this 
image that's not reading you and you 

378
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:15,540
have to say all the right thing is like,
how can I say short?

379
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:15,690
Yeah.
Or towards

380
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,690
that.
Have you ever paid attention at all to 

381
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:20,690
pick up artists?
Yeah,

382
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,190
and pickup artist game.
They're like,

383
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,960
they'll,
they'll just.

384
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,970
It's hilarious.
I've seen some videos online where 

385
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,671
they're actually critiquing people's 
approaches and strategies for getting 

386
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:36,261
women to talk to them.
There's like videos on it where a guy 

387
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:39,111
will have a hidden camera and they'll 
talk to a girl and then the guys in the 

388
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:41,610
comments will be like interesting.
Like opening great game.

389
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:46,611
I like how he's doing this like they 
have like like moves like it's talking 

390
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:48,180
about like Jujitsu or something or the 
way you lean to the right.

391
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,150
Talking to where that call

392
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,030
that's like too much but it's not real.
That's what's crazy about it.

393
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,000
I mean I guess it will work on some 
really fucking dumb girls.

394
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,410
That's how it girls will find out like 
deep into a relationship like months 

395
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,470
later that the guys like heavily in debt
and wanted by the FBI and you know,

396
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,500
beats his mom like you don't find find 
that shit out because he got tricked you

397
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:14,100
with all this,
this strategy and if you can't read that

398
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,260
then you're not going to know that 
something's going on.

399
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,440
But that to me is if you ever really bad
the radar and you can get out of people,

400
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,200
then you are dependent on what they say.
Some people are bad radar,

401
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,010
but what they say is a smoke screen,
you know,

402
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:30,300
and they say maybe real,
maybe in all its people put on a show at

403
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,100
the time and to me it's like,
really?

404
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,180
You didn't feel sitting next to the guy 
for 35 cycles that that guy's a freak or

405
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,440
a woman is evil,
or man,

406
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,270
you feel it.
It's not what they say.

407
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:42,750
It's but it's hard.
It's hard to have sovereignty.

408
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,290
It's hard to have personal sovereignty.
It's hard to be at a place where you 

409
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,110
don't need anybody or you're not needy 
or when you're around a beautiful girl,

410
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,130
you don't give a fuck.
That's hard,

411
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:54,300
man.
It's hard.

412
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:59,301
Most men,
I would say like 99 percent of men when 

413
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:02,700
they're around a really beautiful girl,
they just panic.

414
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:07,701
They start.
Even if there's no chance that girl's 

415
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:07,701
gonna fuck you.
You're your behavior alters.

416
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:12,501
It gets weird.
My solution to it's illegal in 49 and a 

417
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:16,341
half state,
but I think that going toward the nine 

418
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,850
and a half because it's legally in rural
counties in Nevada,

419
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,360
but going tweens,
sanely halt,

420
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:25,410
who curse,
calm people down for immense them point 

421
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:25,410
would be like,
okay,

422
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,960
if I want to get laid with seemingly 
hall tool when I can mind Nicole,

423
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,760
you are nice to them.

424
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,190
They're nice to you,
done so if you do that,

425
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,160
then in the back of your brain is not 
like every time you see a hot woman,

426
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,840
he's like,
I want these as I couldn't.

427
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,030
I couldn't get these any other time in 
another way.

428
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,490
You don't have a game and you've kind of
got lady now other ways.

429
00:19:41,491 --> 00:19:43,590
At least you'll go to the nice,
friendly,

430
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:45,040
who'll courage you've got laid out to 
him.

431
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,370
Women.
Then women don't immediately trigger,

432
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,570
I need something from you.
It's like another hot woman.

433
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,900
I was having sex with a woman yesterday,
so what do you know?

434
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,810
It doesn't have that same pressure with,
so that might.

435
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,250
I have a vague feeling that I'm not 
going to get a TV program on a doctor 

436
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:03,550
feel recommended.
Just go to Ku.

437
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,300
Kersey make their life better,
but that's my thing.

438
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,250
Well,
I'll tell you right now.

439
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,250
That is the wrong approach.
It ain't about the woman being hot.

440
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,470
It's about love.
Serve.

441
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,220
Sorry to buy your right.
We'll just throw by my ankle.

442
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Your balls will.
They'll rot if you hear that long 

443
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,831
enough.
So they get angry and they fall right 

444
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:27,831
off.
Yeah.

445
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,741
I think that the idea of going to a 
hooker in America is disgusting idea.

446
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,290
Like that's how we look at it.
And as our culture,

447
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,320
our culture,
our culture looks at prostitution is 

448
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,960
something foul and you and I both have 
daughters.

449
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,910
We don't want our daughters to become 
prostitutes,

450
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,770
but if you know somebody else's daughter
wants to do it.

451
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,420
So you are son.

452
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,020
There are cases where somebody become a 
whole car because they are life socks 

453
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,780
and they are on.
They are decent.

454
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,800
That,
that's clearly not.

455
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,770
But I've had,
I didn't know a women who have,

456
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:07,771
uh,
who need to become sex workers who are 

457
00:21:07,771 --> 00:21:08,920
speak multiple languages.
Graduated from Ucla,

458
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,660
they have jobs,
they have money,

459
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:15,661
they have stuck in their ways a day you 
have the power and the exchange because 

460
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:19,741
the way they are going to play it is 
that they couldn't see their kind of 

461
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:19,741
like dating except that Ip can my 
clients.

462
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:24,190
And so he's like,
I'm leaping around a lot but I get paid 

463
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,870
bank for doing that and that's a whole 
different kind of,

464
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,580
you know,
not all.

465
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:32,581
Prostitution is the same.
That's a whole different game that 

466
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:33,070
somebody will come through acquisition 
where they are empowered reatard and the

467
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:36,040
typical street hooker kind of thing.
That's a whole different game.

468
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,350
Yeah.
I've met girls that have done that,

469
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,650
that have actually like had like wealthy
men that they've had sex with and then 

470
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,520
they only had like a few of them and 
they,

471
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:51,521
you know,
they fucked him like a couple times a 

472
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:51,521
month and that was there.
That was how they made all their money.

473
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,970
Right.
And they but they didn't like take other

474
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,760
clients on and I was like that is just 
weird.

475
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:56,510
That is weird.
But,

476
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,750
but why is it weird?
Because when you look at like a really 

477
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,310
hot woman,
like the Donald Sterling situation,

478
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,470
that old troll looking raised in man,
and he had that girl that,

479
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:14,471
uh,
the one that ratted them out and made 

480
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:14,471
those recordings.
She was hot.

481
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,990
She was young and hot with a nice body.
Like what do,

482
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:22,020
what do we think is going on there?
Why do we think he bought her a 

483
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,970
multimillion dollar condo and a Bentley 
and all that.

484
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,470
Why is it okay to just by people so you 
can exchange gold coins.

485
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,750
Can you exchange gold coins is not 
paper.

486
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,360
I work Saturday.
Can you buy someone a house?

487
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:35,360
You just can't give them cash.
I get weird.

488
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:39,500
Like why is the exchange?
Like when the exchange is actual money,

489
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:40,970
not something that you can convert to 
money,

490
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:43,250
but the actual money itself,
it becomes an issue.

491
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:47,300
Like prostitution exists across the 
board in many,

492
00:22:47,301 --> 00:22:52,301
many relationships.
I have friends that are married to 

493
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:52,301
prostitutes.
They really are.

494
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:57,010
They just happened to be monogamous,
but also that they're monogamous 

495
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,891
prostitutes.
But these guys are wealthy guys and 

496
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:00,950
there's these women that they're dating 
really don't even particularly like them

497
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,050
and they have to buy them things all the
time.

498
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Gosh,
they have to constantly keep the fires 

499
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,060
of this.
Uh,

500
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,880
this style of relationship lit that I 
find weird is like easy,

501
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,200
easier to just pay for echolook are 
gold.

502
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,200
They are each tie but those.
But then,

503
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:20,201
you know,
the problem is people want 

504
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:20,201
companionship.
They want someone to be there for them.

505
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,640
You're not going to get the by paying 
somebody for that.

506
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,220
Sometimes it works.
Yeah,

507
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:28,820
I dunno.
It's like saying it can never work.

508
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:34,370
I just think that a lot of people would 
be way better off a lot of people if sex

509
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,080
wasn't such a big deal.
Yep.

510
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,320
And I think that is a big part of what's
going on.

511
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:44,300
Like part of what's going on with,
with campuses,

512
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,980
um,
were there,

513
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:50,981
they have this massive amount of 
attention that's being paid to sexual 

514
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,510
assault is very good in a lot of ways.
But your sexual assault,

515
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:56,870
actual real sexual assault is horrific.
Fucking that's disgusting.

516
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,800
It's fucked up.
And you know,

517
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,160
the idea that my son could do it or that
I could have done it when I was young as

518
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,300
it's terrifying to me and disgusting to 
me,

519
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,960
but equally equally true.

520
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,020
The idea of someone being accused of 
sexual assault where it really was just 

521
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,050
regret that,
you know,

522
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,290
there's a lot of people that are trying 
to say that if two people get drunk and 

523
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:25,101
they have sex and then somehow or 
another that rape and it's just people 

524
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:27,200
having sex.
There's no violence,

525
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,330
there's no forcing.
There's no,

526
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,730
that's,
that's crazy talk.

527
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:37,060
And a lot of that comes from the idea,
these puritanical ideas that sex is 

528
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:42,611
somehow a bad thing because if two 
people got together and they got drunk 

529
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:43,040
and just cuddled,
no one gives a shit.

530
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,730
Yeah,
that's fine.

531
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,960
But it's like,
where does it end?

532
00:24:47,961 --> 00:24:48,620
Like he would,
okay,

533
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:52,880
what if you just cuddle and you both 
have shorts on and a t shirt and the guy

534
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:54,410
gets a boner.
Like what happens there?

535
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,940
You know,
is that bad?

536
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Like what if,
what if you're cuddling and the guy and 

537
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,450
the girl don't have shirts on,
but they have their pants on,

538
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,130
like what the fuck are we doing?

539
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,580
I don't know if people,
if they're drunk and they hug everyone's

540
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,710
okay,
but if they're drunk and they fuck,

541
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,240
it's a real problem,
right?

542
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,770
Well,
if,

543
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,470
if someone says no and the other person 
forces them or does it,

544
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500
then the problem is of course.
But if it's just two people that drink 

545
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,190
and then do something in the other 
person wakes up in the morning,

546
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:22,930
he goes,
I can't believe it.

547
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,730
Fuck that Guy Shit.
And then their friends,

548
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:30,731
oh my God,
were you drunk when you could not 

549
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:30,731
consent.
That is rape.

550
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:31,080
It's not rape.
He was drunk too,

551
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,110
right?
Like there was uh,

552
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,430
this,
uh,

553
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,120
I forget what the protest was,
but these guys had these signs that said

554
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,790
regret is not rape and there was this 
fucking terrible backlash this.

555
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,470
But that is what it is,
is regret.

556
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,910
Whatever happened to fucking up would 
have ever happened to making mistakes.

557
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
And also why is it that one gender gets 
a g get out of jail free card,

558
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,360
like you got raped.
Whereas every guy that I've ever met has

559
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:01,580
gotten drunk and had sex with someone 
that they regretted.

560
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,070
And then after it's over the like,
oh Jesus Christ,

561
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:06,140
what did I do?
Oh my God.

562
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,510
And then the girls calling you or you 
know,

563
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,870
you see her again,
right?

564
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:15,871
Yeah.
Nobody think of it that the guy got 

565
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:15,871
raped.
Yeah.

566
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:15,871
Yeah.
And the guy himself,

567
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:20,051
he's not going to think that a woman 
would think that if a woman got drunk 

568
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:24,161
with a guy,
but then of course you get into this 

569
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:27,551
bill cosby territory where a guy is 
purposely getting someone drunk or 

570
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:29,990
purpose of getting someone fucked up.
Well,

571
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,820
of course that's,
that's where it gets weird,

572
00:26:31,821 --> 00:26:32,330
right?
That's,

573
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,620
that's where it all turns into an actual
crime or an actual,

574
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,000
you know,
a,

575
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,110
a negative interaction or verifiable.
Bonafide

576
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:44,890
assault.
Yeah.

577
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,740
That's different even as the intent is 
different thing to another.

578
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,400
Okay.
Whatever.

579
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:55,401
That's one story that that one is I'm 
trying to get you to a vulnerable 

580
00:26:55,401 --> 00:26:58,911
position because I want to take 
something from you that you don't want 

581
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:01,220
to get you and I'm coercing you into 
being sneaky about it and yeah,

582
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:06,221
that's a different story.
So that's a dark thing that it happened.

583
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,560
It happens.
A lot of women,

584
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,430
man,
a lot.

585
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,490
I've talked to several women who have 
been roofied you fuck it up when I was 

586
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:19,761
in high school that I had once,
that was pretty hot girl who was just 

587
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:23,400
passed out drunk and there was two guys 
at the party were clearly just moving in

588
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,910
that direction and clear and all about 
what was going on.

589
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,280
That was,
there was no ambiguity there.

590
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,950
Dates like that easier trying to rape 
somebody that's not.

591
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,660
So I remember just I added my good 
Samaritan Day of my life where I just 

592
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,560
kind of picked her up,
walking her outside bird throw up 

593
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,560
because I was like,
no,

594
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,880
no.
Is like the easiest bad scenario,

595
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:45,370
right?
Dr.

596
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,390
This is not a pleasant one and he's not 
a game to one where everybody's drunk 

597
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,320
and it's different.
There's no intent Dz.

598
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,550
Somebody will say,
Oh,

599
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,710
vulnerability,
I'm going after that.

600
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,010
I wonder if anyone's ever done a study 
on places that have legalized 

601
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,821
prostitution,
whether or more or less sexual assaults 

602
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:07,170
from what I remember.
And I do believe I've seen studies about

603
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,171
it.
I think he was less because Jamie head 

604
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:12,171
to google.
Yes.

605
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,020
Um,
yeah,

606
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I,
I would assume that when it's not 

607
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,201
something that's almost impossible to 
attain because you think about it like 

608
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,730
the average guy who makes a good living,
um,

609
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,970
you know,
maybe occasionally you could afford to 

610
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:29,170
spend $500 on a prostitute or whatever 
the Holocaust.

611
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,640
But the idea of getting that prostitute 
to be in a sexual relationship with you 

612
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,570
voluntarily is almost out of the 
question.

613
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:38,100
Right?
But you,

614
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,390
if you're goofy looking,
dude,

615
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,970
you can pay that girl and she'll fuck 
you.

616
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,840
And the weight of that exchange has sort
of been lifted.

617
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,870
I mean,
there's a potential that you could get 

618
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,001
addicted to going to prostitutes,
but you can get addicted to go into a 

619
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:53,001
pool hall.
Of course,

620
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:55,200
you know,
you can get addicted to swimming.

621
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,770
I know people that every morning they 
get up and they fucking swim.

622
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:00,400
They have to swim.
I didn't swim to that.

623
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:04,170
And if you have the money to like,
there was a,

624
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,870
there was a don winslow it,
I don't know if you ever read that guy.

625
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,640
He's a master.
Don winslow.

626
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,100
Yeah.
No really good.

627
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,040
Right?
Never heard of them.

628
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,960
There's a lot.
He's the guy who did the movie savages.

629
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,160
Um,
what is it?

630
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,530
Savages.
Oliver Stone movie.

631
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,740
Oh yeah.
It was basically,

632
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,120
I don't know.
Was that a good movie?

633
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,220
I haven't seen it to be honest.
I read the book.

634
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:27,370
The book was good.
Um,

635
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,280
the movie I didn't or anything that made
me want to see it.

636
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,000
So I was like,
Hey,

637
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,310
pass about guys.
Like with the right turn,

638
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,330
he has these wild line.
At one point I forgot which not they 

639
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:38,330
taste,
but he has this line where one guy like,

640
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:43,160
you know,
she's only with you because of your 

641
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,160
money.
And the other note is like,

642
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,160
well,
good thing I have money.

643
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,990
Then it was awesome.

644
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,890
Yeah.
What does that mean?

645
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,680
She's only with you because of this?
Well,

646
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,970
whatever.
With you,

647
00:29:54,971 --> 00:29:57,010
because you're big dick and your broad 
shoulders,

648
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:02,220
so stupid.
What does that mean,

649
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,370
right?
She's only with you because you're more 

650
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:07,370
attractive and more intelligent and more
successful than me.

651
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,020
Oh,
okay.

652
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:13,021
Well that just diminished me to the 
point where I could no longer enjoy the 

653
00:30:13,021 --> 00:30:15,100
sexual sexual favors of this young lady 
coming.

654
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,160
What does that mean?
People are people that try to diminish 

655
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,590
you.
You're only be because of goose kind of 

656
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,400
stuff.
They were talking about the sex work.

657
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,380
I find it hilarious when people look 
down on it,

658
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,860
kind of like,
oh my God.

659
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,960
I'm like,
do you work the job you have?

660
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,550
Is that a job that you would have?
If nobody pays you,

661
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,180
would you do that same stuff anyway in 
99 percent of people would say,

662
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,690
nice because I want to get paid and it's
like playing to exactly our.

663
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,230
You are different from a hooker.
Embrace your inner hooker,

664
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,530
man.
You're doing it for demand it.

665
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:53,560
That's where it.
Your inner hooker researchers 

666
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,791
decriminalize prostitution.
Rhode Island lead to fewer rape and 

667
00:30:56,791 --> 00:30:57,240
fewer gonorrhea cases.
My point,

668
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,100
but that's not even legal.
That's just decriminalized,

669
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,260
so that means you can get arrested for 
it.

670
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,250
Um,
so.

671
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:07,150
And stuff on both ends of it actually.
So what's that?

672
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,760
I was finding it on articles on both 
ends.

673
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,650
What do you mean by that?
It was going up and down.

674
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,230
There's people saying both clearly 
showed that it increases.

675
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,300
Not Statistics clearly show that it 
decreases that kind of stuff.

676
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,540
Yeah.
There's studies for whichever side you 

677
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:24,540
really want to pay it.
Really.

678
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,590
It's like the Bible.
You'll see nicotine equipment.

679
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:29,710
Allies though is not legalized.
What you want is a nice brothel,

680
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,640
nice and clean.
Like a,

681
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,740
you know,
like a beautiful establishment,

682
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,680
like a,
a burke williams spa,

683
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,890
berquist stuff.

684
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,340
Williams of hookers,
Burke Williams,

685
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:49,341
spa there,
they give you a glass of water with 

686
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,991
lemon in it and it's nice and they have 
the chimes going and the incense you 

687
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,160
walk in,
they're scented candles,

688
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,190
can be a nice massage,
but you know,

689
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,750
they're not supposed to have sex with 
you.

690
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,310
See,
that's a problem.

691
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,120
But if you can go to one of those places
and they had sex with you,

692
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,960
you'd be like,
this is what a great exchange.

693
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:05,920
No,
perfect.

694
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:08,160
I'm nice to you.
If you've got a bunch of money or nice.

695
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,920
Everybody wins.
It's puritanical.

696
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,090
It totally is.
Because if you really break it down,

697
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,500
why would it be illegal to do something 
that you can do for free?

698
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,500
If you can do it for money?
Right?

699
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,010
Why?
I mean if you could do it for free,

700
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,190
why can't you do it for money?
Because everything else you can do like 

701
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,440
massage,
like you could give people foot massages

702
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,640
all day.
Exactly.

703
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:31,000
But the fit's a sexual thing.
Suddenly it's illegal and it's terrible.

704
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:31,720
They,
I find a dealer.

705
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,750
It's disease,
a puritanical religious crap that we 

706
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,040
carry with us from,
you know,

707
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,370
another time.
It just still around

708
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,620
in people's mentality because when you 
think about it,

709
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:44,720
I think it's complete bullshit.
It's,

710
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,220
it works our minds too because it turned
sex into some forbidden dirty act.

711
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,940
Yup.
Yup.

712
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,870
Yup.
Now,

713
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,120
I don't know,
it's um,

714
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,720
the,
the whole like pattern of it is very 

715
00:32:58,191 --> 00:32:59,960
difficult to break though.
I don't.

716
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,240
I mean,
I think they broke it somewhat in the 

717
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,240
sixties,
you know,

718
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,770
summer of love and,
but they were all on acid.

719
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,340
That definitely out that totally.
I mean that is what acid does.

720
00:33:13,341 --> 00:33:16,340
That's what mushrooms do.
That's what DMT does.

721
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,660
That paradigm shifting reset button 
where you go,

722
00:33:20,661 --> 00:33:22,610
oh,
well why am I doing it this way?

723
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,920
Why am I doing?
Yeah.

724
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,030
That's where all those songs like love 
the one you're with.

725
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,200
All that came from.
It was the free love generation.

726
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,160
It was different,
right?

727
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:32,480
Yeah.
Isn't that interesting?

728
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,200
Like that's all.

729
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,200
It took.
Just a little bit of drugs and people 

730
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,081
went from father knows best to love the 
one you're with and like inside of 10 

731
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:41,081
years,
90,

732
00:33:41,081 --> 00:33:43,400
67,
30 feet times music wise,

733
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:45,260
you listen to what people are really 
saying too.

734
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:50,261
In 1961,
what they are listening to by 1968 and 

735
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,740
it feels like 30 on 30 years have gone 
by.

736
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:54,890
It's a nice night than day kind of 
thing.

737
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:59,891
They are like,
how did that even happen in that little 

738
00:33:59,891 --> 00:33:59,891
period of time?
It's,

739
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:04,450
you know,
you'll go from your low motown to Jimi 

740
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,460
Hendrix and it doesn't even sound 
remotely close.

741
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,440
It's everything.
The clothes,

742
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,600
they start wearing bandanas and bell 
bottoms and freaky vests and shirts with

743
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:19,601
flowers on them.
Like the whole thing just fucking 

744
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,040
completely flipped on its head.
Just some drugs these much time.

745
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,080
That's what people don't really truly 
comprehend and I didn't truly comprehend

746
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:31,400
until I got older because when I was a 
kid and I was in school,

747
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:31,800
I.

748
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,540
okay.
I graduated from school in 1985.

749
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,950
That's when I graduated from high 
school.

750
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:42,340
And if you stop and think about that 20 
years before that was the height of all 

751
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:44,810
that freaky shit.
Yup.

752
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:50,110
It was alive and popping in 1965.
That's like,

753
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,620
that's not that long ago,
man.

754
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,490
Nineteen 95 to us like 1995 seems like 
the other day,

755
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:02,990
years ago to think about 1995 just being
freaks and hippies and woodstock and 

756
00:35:04,461 --> 00:35:07,820
chaos.
And then the government just threw water

757
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:12,821
on the whole thing,
put that fire out and everything calmed 

758
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:13,180
down in the seventies and the eighties 
that gave everybody coke.

759
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,520
And then Miami vice and Don Johnson 
didn't have any socks on and he's 

760
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,671
driving around the Testarossa and it all
sort of got to this different place,

761
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:27,260
like they took the drugs out of the 
equation and there was this big void and

762
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:32,261
no one knew what to do and it just sort 
of like had this chaotic bouncing 

763
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:36,671
against the wall thing where it was 
trying to find its equilibrium and find 

764
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:37,100
it's harmonious vibration.

765
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Get back to where it would've been,
but inexorably altered because of this 

766
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,080
one decade.
Big Time.

767
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:48,081
I mean even the dogs just mean.
It's not like in the eighties people 

768
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,781
were in doing drugs but nasty.
Our dogs go from psychedelics to hard 

769
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,440
stuff like crack,
crack.

770
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,310
We're not talking the same drugs.
Here is a very different kind of game.

771
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,900
Amazing.
It's amazing.

772
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,930
It's really amazing when you get older 
and you realize that 10 years is 

773
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,020
nothing.
It's such a.

774
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,300
like 10 years ago it was 2005.
That is exactly like today.

775
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,620
What was the difference in 2005 and 
today,

776
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,260
no iphones.
Other than that,

777
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:15,300
what's the difference?
We were all online.

778
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,480
Everybody had email,
I mean there was less social media and 

779
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,950
things along those lines,
but ultimately is very little difference

780
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:26,790
between today in 2005.
If you had a 2005 car,

781
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,910
that's a nice car that you could drive 
that around and be just like a modern 

782
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:32,370
car,
be November 2015 car.

783
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,370
No different.
Not much difference in the music.

784
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,010
We listen to some music from 2005,
so yeah,

785
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,500
pretty similar.
Big thing,

786
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,450
but yeah,
you can take a song from 2005.

787
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,690
You could totally release it today like 
a hit and it'll be a hit today,

788
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:51,290
but the difference between a hit from 
1955 and a hit from 1960 five cents day.

789
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,280
Jesus,
what a difference about which is why to 

790
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,070
this day,
people about the 1960 seat there who 

791
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,210
love it or hate it.
They have really not medical oncology or

792
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:04,680
ever seen them.
They're like,

793
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,710
oh thank God for the sixties.
That's where all the coolest stuff 

794
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:09,710
started up.
Anything.

795
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,220
He's very far to find people who are 
neutral about it.

796
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,710
This is the differences of the people 
that got the drugs and didn't get any 

797
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,921
drugs.
People that were getting crew cuts and 

798
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,150
fucking goddamn headache.
No,

799
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,000
they never got it.

800
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,410
They didn't understand they missed the 
boat.

801
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,560
Yeah.
That's Vietnam.

802
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,990
They didn't.
That's what I put.

803
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,030
It's fascinating to think that the 
culture can shift and change so quickly.

804
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,250
That must have been terrifying for the 
old guard.

805
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,230
You know,
the people that that were.

806
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,800
I mean you also have to think the,
the,

807
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,030
the ability to communicate about these 
things,

808
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,790
about these complex issues didn't exist 
back then.

809
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:47,510
So all you can do is go down to your 
local bar and complain or your.

810
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,070
I guess they didn't even have coffee 
shops back then,

811
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,390
right?
No coffee shops is who the fuck when,

812
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,590
when there's,
there was like diners.

813
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,010
Huh?
I mean I didn't have like a starbucks,

814
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,530
you know,
that shit didn't even exist,

815
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,820
man.
That's nuts.

816
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:08,060
When I was a kid,
like you would go to Dunkin donuts and 

817
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,430
get coffee,
but that was it.

818
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,670
There was no starbucks and no place like
the mom and pop store wasn't just open 

819
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,060
tables where people could sit down and 
chat with you and get your coffee,

820
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:20,730
get out.
I mean it was all local.

821
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,150
Like I remember like if you're a worldly
person in Boston,

822
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:27,510
you would get the New York Times like 
that was to show everybody that you were

823
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:27,990
world.

824
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,480
If you're a dummy,
you would get the herald and if you 

825
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,480
were,
you know,

826
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,300
local,
but you know,

827
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,370
you're on the ball.
You get the Boston Globe guys to deliver

828
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:41,560
all three of them.
The New York Times.

829
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:44,320
I was very rare and whenever I would 
deliver the New York Times,

830
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,060
the dude always had like a bmw or a Saab
or something like that.

831
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,380
You know?
They always had like some,

832
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,300
some cool car and they lived in a,
a cool house and they just,

833
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:00,500
they wanted to be more into.
They didn't want to live in New York 

834
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:00,500
necessarily.
Or if they did,

835
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,930
they didn't have the funds to move 
there,

836
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:05,910
but they wanted to be worldly.
They sounded like they had the money.

837
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:06,960
Yeah.
Well that's.

838
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,460
And that's how you got ahold of the real
news.

839
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,820
That's how you had your finger on the 
pulse and you had to be active.

840
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,890
Like I remember,
you know,

841
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,900
like um,
there was this guy that I knew that 

842
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:19,900
would,
you know,

843
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:19,900
he would read all the papers,
he would read the times,

844
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,690
he'd read the Herald and I would,
I would ask him like,

845
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:27,691
why,
why do you read all these different 

846
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:27,691
papers?

847
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:29,580
Want to just pick one and read them.
Just like to really get a sense of 

848
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,190
what's going on in the world.
You really got to read all of them.

849
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:35,191
Like the New York Times will cover some 
subjects globally that the Boston Globe 

850
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:39,160
won't.
Boston Herald doesn't give a fuck about 

851
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,921
what's happening anywhere but Boston.
And there was like this thing where you 

852
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,790
had to kind of like search around to get
a,

853
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:47,791
a sound like a,
a distant sound of the earth of like 

854
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:52,260
what's actually going on on the planet.
Whereas today it's unavoidable today 

855
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,690
actually kind of hide from it.
And

856
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,900
I know you said no spoiler,
I don't want to know about that.

857
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,090
Tell me about the walking dead.
Yeah,

858
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,340
no,
I know.

859
00:39:59,341 --> 00:40:02,020
It's when I was growing up.
Me being in Italy too,

860
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,740
which was even further removed from 
several of the newest.

861
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,890
I love basketball and I remember when I 
was maybe eight,

862
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,920
nine years old,
I wanted to find out who won the NBA 

863
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,260
finals and that was the game on Sunday.
What happened,

864
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,650
and I leaked earlier,
would have to call the one magazine you 

865
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,311
need to let Dale dealt with basketball 
that would come out once a month and I 

866
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:27,301
would call them and they had talked to 
their friend in New York with two of 

867
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,660
them are one.
Otherwise I would have had to wait three

868
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:33,661
weeks until the next day she'll come up 
on the MBA finals earlier.

869
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:39,370
Wow.
That's the word that I know that I grew 

870
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:39,370
up even.

871
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,050
So it's like,
do we even think about today?

872
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:44,860
You can be on the top of the Malaya and 
find the right connection.

873
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:49,870
You can watch the game live.
It's like that's a whole lot that are 

874
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,230
game altogether.
Yeah.

875
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:55,231
You were reading about basketball that 
happened weeks ago and get all excited.

876
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,410
It's like,
I can't believe I'm going to find out.

877
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:03,411
It's now about came.
It's like when were the first organized 

878
00:41:03,411 --> 00:41:06,901
sports?
There was 89 hundredths already late 18 

879
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:07,080
hundreds.
Anyway,

880
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:12,210
as you start to having a whole bunch and
there's an awesome story about the 

881
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,390
devito window football in the United 
States,

882
00:41:13,391 --> 00:41:15,940
which was by no means the first sizeable
was before and noticing,

883
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,200
but football is funny because there's 
the story that late 89 that it's.

884
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,210
There's no more frontier.
There are no more Indian wars because 

885
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,021
everybody's been calling course,
so there was not any more traditional 

886
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:30,430
for kind of per class males to go into 
military fight the Indians,

887
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:31,120
that kind of stuff.

888
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,900
So many of the old guard fell that there
are kids who are growing up to be a 

889
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,780
Williams is like what you are into and 
killed a few Indians.

890
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,420
What's wrong with you?
You're not a real man.

891
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,480
So they would send them to all the Ivy 
League school that were beginning to 

892
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,060
papa,
but they felt like,

893
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:48,260
yeah,
you read the books,

894
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,290
you don't kill anybody.
I don't know about your masculinity.

895
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,910
Really.
So somebody was like,

896
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:57,911
okay,
we can play this game where they beat 

897
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,881
the shit out of each other.
It's great to be these mainly physical 

898
00:42:00,881 --> 00:42:01,490
game where they just brutalize each 
other.

899
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,220
Then at least,
you know,

900
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,530
it's not as good as bringing home a good
scale for.

901
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,620
But it's something,
you know,

902
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:09,620
it's like,
it saves their masculinity and stuff and

903
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:12,260
that's how a lot of.
So if you see the old,

904
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:14,900
the big football programs of the late 80
[inaudible],

905
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:20,110
early 99,
they were all ivy Lee's code stuff that 

906
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,110
today you'll never,
you know,

907
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,180
Harvard,
Yale,

908
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,940
they had a top football program.

909
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:26,950
So it is like,
how the hell did that even at a lot of 

910
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,170
it was because it was a way to show,
look,

911
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,090
I read the books but I'm still a man.
Okay.

912
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:31,280
I'd still tough.
Wow,

913
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:33,170
that's,
that's interesting.

914
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,920
So it was a substitute for war.
Yep.

915
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,170
W much totally makes sense.
I mean that's kind of exactly what it 

916
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,700
is.
If you watch a game,

917
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,750
it's,
you know,

918
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,120
you're winning,
you're attacking,

919
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,980
you know,
trying to defend.

920
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:49,010
You're crossing a boundary which is like
the,

921
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,570
the border to the city,
the gates to the,

922
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,230
to the brothel or to the castle or to 
wherever you're trying to break into.

923
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,880
Wow.
No,

924
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,130
and even at these old,
the top schools were ivy league,

925
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,600
upper class,
you know,

926
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,070
super rich people and then one of the 
top was carlisle Indian school,

927
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:15,071
which was the lowest of the low,
like poorest people in the United 

928
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,071
States.

929
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,590
Indian kids who got sent there and 
boarding schools that nothing to do.

930
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:22,600
They would play football and so what 
they would do is that they will study 

931
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,680
the rulebook,
try to figure out what is the.

932
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:27,860
Nobody's doing that technically is legal
but that you know,

933
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,880
what kind of loophole can we play with?
And they would start using some tactical

934
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,620
that nobody had used.
Kill everybody in the process.

935
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,390
So then the league goes,
okay,

936
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,510
we can them into that NBA is beating 
higher to,

937
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,110
so let's change that or what's that 
thing?

938
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:44,570
They do make it illegal.
Like what things weren't.

939
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,360
You know what?
I don't.

940
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,330
I wish I remember.
I read through the list.

941
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:48,280
There were some,
they were really,

942
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,350
but basically they develop the game of 
football in terms of,

943
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,650
you know,
this constant game between the league 

944
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:56,900
and the Indian schools where these guys 
use some loophole,

945
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:02,050
the leak can't seem,
makes it illegal and then the next time 

946
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,481
they use a different loophole and that 
the consultants have a lot of the rules 

947
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:05,030
of football were shaped to start.
Okay,

948
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,860
those guys do it.
Let's stop it right now.

949
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,750
Interesting.
That's lucky for them.

950
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:13,751
Black people weren't playing back then.
Didn't change all the rules.

951
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:14,490
Yeah.
Excellent.

952
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,490
That's what they've done.
Now they just give up.

953
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,580
It's mostly black so you can try.
You can.

954
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:25,090
You can get really big and white and 
block runners or you can get a.

955
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,240
You got good eyesight,
hand eye coordination to throw the ball 

956
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:30,240
at.
Black people could run really fast,

957
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,380
but

958
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,190
it's so rare you get like a super speedy
white guy.

959
00:44:35,191 --> 00:44:40,191
When one comes around he runs like a 
black guy to Lariat is fucking 

960
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,900
hilarious.
He's funny.

961
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:49,901
I would just stereotypes change over 
time because like eerily you add the 

962
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:54,110
show like ed breaks down many of the 
early natural law,

963
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,620
the natural Jewish wait,
so which one or you know,

964
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
a lot of the early books were all Irish 
or the,

965
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:06,681
you know,
a lot of Jewish boxers back on a day 

966
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:10,160
bake time.
Well there were people that were fucked 

967
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,160
with,
you know,

968
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,160
they were the early immigrants and they 
were struggling.

969
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,540
That's what it's always seems to be.
It seems to be the,

970
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,600
the,
the group that is like the most recent 

971
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:17,870
immigrants,
like now we get to,

972
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:22,871
you get a lot of Russians,
a lot of Russians in both Europe and in 

973
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:24,810
America was so many Russians in mma.

974
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,260
Dagestan of Dagestan people and fucking 
completely disproportionate amount of 

975
00:45:30,391 --> 00:45:34,130
elite fighters to I really fucking tough
guys from Russia.

976
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,090
Not if you've ever used to.
I mean he's as almost data with TB code,

977
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,340
but if you ever used to toughness 
throughout your life,

978
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:42,480
then client meeting during doesn't seem 
like much.

979
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:45,840
He's got old shampoo protech that a 
client meeting Katie has.

980
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:48,180
Hell exactly.
It's exactly what it is,

981
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:53,570
is exactly what it is,
and it's also like the hunger that you 

982
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:56,961
have because your life has been like 
just filled with despair and struggle 

983
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:02,070
and in a lot of abuse.
So like violence becomes some sort of an

984
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:04,710
automatic response to reaching out for 
abuse.

985
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,640
Uh,
you know,

986
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,880
reaching out in response for the,
the abusive suffered like they have a 

987
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,850
chip on your shoulder comes from.
Right,

988
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
right.
It's like someone just just waiting for 

989
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,020
someone to say some shit because he just
been dealing bottled up.

990
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,680
You have.
It's like please just cross that line.

991
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:27,681
So I have an excuse to beat the shit out
of fuel right now for a few generations 

992
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:28,290
later.
Your kids are pussies.

993
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:31,420
Yeah.
Look at her like,

994
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,840
go play football.
Dammit.

995
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:37,920
What kind of man are you?
But it's weird because like isn't it 

996
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,210
kind of a good thing that they become 
pussies because that means we've become 

997
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:41,640
civilized and everyone's sort of calmed 
down.

998
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,560
It's like this is weird fine line that 
we walk because ultimately we would like

999
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,650
to have no violence.
Like ultimately we would love it if you 

1000
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:51,780
never had to worry about a threat of 
violence,

1001
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:55,170
just go through your entire life.
Never worry about anybody shooting.

1002
00:46:55,171 --> 00:47:00,171
You are stabbing,
you are beating you up and that'd be 

1003
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:02,601
beautiful.
But along the line you kind of lose out 

1004
00:47:03,091 --> 00:47:07,420
on a lot of the stuff that comes along 
with living a hard life.

1005
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,870
Yup.
The character that you develop.

1006
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,330
Like everybody that I know that grew up 
in a tough neighborhood,

1007
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:15,270
they have a sharpness to them,
you know,

1008
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,870
and there's a character that they have 
that they possessed that the people that

1009
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:21,910
grew up super cushy and some,
you know,

1010
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,770
Connecticut Country Club,
estate type situation,

1011
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,780
read the notice and I didn't get to walk
into her to environment,

1012
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,340
but he definitely was not a upper class 
three Chinese thing.

1013
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,000
So to me dealing with gangsters was kind
of normal.

1014
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:37,720
Was like,
you know,

1015
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,150
Jessica and stared.
There are clear rules of the game,

1016
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:41,350
you know,
how to deal with them.

1017
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,860
And so to see people who don't have that
experience,

1018
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,590
when they deal with somebody who is by 
nature,

1019
00:47:47,591 --> 00:47:49,960
by what kind of gangsters like mafia 
guys,

1020
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,000
not formally,
no.

1021
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:53,830
Usually not mafia,
more just like,

1022
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,200
you know,
people do deal.

1023
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,730
People who uh,
you know,

1024
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:02,600
that kind of thing where it's like the 
guys who are awesome series our taste of

1025
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,900
shoplifting,
we'll just can go into a store and walk 

1026
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,070
out and they would do it pretty much 
professionally where they make a living.

1027
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,150
Like,
you know,

1028
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:13,980
stuff like that where he's always like 
crossing to do any legal stuff.

1029
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,990
Not.
I mean I've met some guys who were 

1030
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,330
probably more well connected in a more 
formal way but not,

1031
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:24,570
that was not the normal thing but normal
thing was guys will do a lot of illegal 

1032
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,681
stuff where maybe they are not 
technically against during a strict 

1033
00:48:28,681 --> 00:48:29,800
science,
but people who get into a lot of fights.

1034
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:34,800
So you know,
that kind of thing where it's like sort 

1035
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,140
of outside of the normal rules of 
civilized society.

1036
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,000
But to me it's like there are clear 
rules of what you do with those guys.

1037
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,300
Usually if you treat them with respect 
and you don't show yourself to be a 

1038
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:45,730
wimp,
they treat you fairly well.

1039
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,790
There's a.
If you know how to play the game,

1040
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,340
if you don't,
you know these guys will test you and if

1041
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:54,300
they smell weakness then they'll clamp 
down on you.

1042
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,470
And if you only.
If you look down on them,

1043
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,080
they will clamp down on you.
You know,

1044
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,800
there's a very clear rule of the game 
that if you play it right,

1045
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,900
you can have very mellow,
pleasant interactions.

1046
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:10,560
But people who don't have that 
experience that I see them interact 

1047
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:10,630
with,
like don't say that.

1048
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:12,920
You can not say that,
you know,

1049
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:14,420
that's just not good.

1050
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,870
I ended well,
that's bad.

1051
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:22,190
Well,
some people have a real issue with 

1052
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:22,450
letting people in to their life.
Like you would see that.

1053
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:27,451
Like that was what people always said 
about like rap music and one of the big 

1054
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:29,050
problems with rap music because these 
guys would make it and they would become

1055
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:34,051
legit and then they would let like 
gangsters in their life because they 

1056
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,610
wanted to be seen with these people.
They wanted to be legit.

1057
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,490
And then all of a sudden these people 
are like completely intertwined in their

1058
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:40,030
life.
Yep.

1059
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,600
Apparently that happened with Edward 
James Almost when he did that movie.

1060
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:45,070
American May.
Yeah.

1061
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,680
That was,
you know,

1062
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,870
the story behind that.
Yeah.

1063
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,630
That was scared to business.
Yeah.

1064
00:49:49,631 --> 00:49:53,710
It was heavy duty movie and the movie 
was all about these Mexican gang bangers

1065
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,030
and apparently he had become friends 
with these guys,

1066
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:03,320
you know,
air quotes friend while filming this 

1067
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,441
movie and just got way too close and 
they just started extorting them and 

1068
00:50:07,441 --> 00:50:07,570
they started demanding money and you 
know,

1069
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,290
when they knew where he lived and it 
became a real fucking issue.

1070
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,470
Yeah.
You are their lunch at that point again,

1071
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,760
if they think that there's any weakness 
there,

1072
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,850
Danielle road,
that's why it's a,

1073
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:22,870
there's a parade authorial aspect to 
that game or you need to know how to 

1074
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:24,160
play otherwise you're fucked.
And I'm sure he wanted to be down,

1075
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:29,161
you know,
of course doing this movie is going to 

1076
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:29,161
play this gangster

1077
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:33,280
Cholo.
But then the movie handle is gay sex in 

1078
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,620
that,
hey,

1079
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,410
you're not supposed to talk.
That was a heavy moment man.

1080
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:43,840
Yeah,
there was a lot of weirdness in that 

1081
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:43,840
movie.
It's like what is going on?

1082
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,400
Yeah,
that was definitely bad stuff,

1083
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,520
but that,
that whole like becoming tight with 

1084
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:51,520
gangsters,
like that's a.

1085
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,580
that's a common tale.
That's a.

1086
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,280
That has repeated itself over and over 
and over again with Hollywood actors 

1087
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,241
that wanted to be like tough guys or 
weakness right there because he mailed 

1088
00:51:04,241 --> 00:51:05,840
that.
You want something from them or that you

1089
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:08,350
look up to them in some way.
Then that's waking.

1090
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,640
I see.
They see you putting them down.

1091
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:15,641
That's also a challenge.
So you're kind of screwed if you do one 

1092
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:15,641
thing,
you're screwed.

1093
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:16,100
If you do another.
Just sort of a narrow ways.

1094
00:51:16,101 --> 00:51:18,200
Not too narrow,
you know there is a way to do it,

1095
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,590
but if you step outside of it yet you're
fucked.

1096
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,160
Yeah,
and it's.

1097
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,560
But it's the same thing is like getting 
into fights.

1098
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,570
You know,
if you are too aggressive,

1099
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:31,571
you will get into fights because you're 
are challenging people and you're 

1100
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:31,571
backing them and against the and they 
have to fight you back.

1101
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:36,880
But if you are too low,
then people won't respect you and they 

1102
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:36,880
see you as a week and they come after 
you.

1103
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,980
You kind of have to have that boundary 
where you are polite to people,

1104
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:44,981
they are nice,
but the message is look on nights 

1105
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:45,320
because I chose to decide to cross that 
line.

1106
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:50,350
I'm going to fuck you up right now.
And that vibe where it's like you can 

1107
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,400
bring up the goods when it comes down to
throwing down,

1108
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:57,401
but you don't volunteer at.
You're not as much a guy who was like 

1109
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:58,550
trying to get into a fight.
That's what usually people are out for a

1110
00:51:58,551 --> 00:52:00,350
fight and to respect them by the way 
from.

1111
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,760
She was like,
that guy,

1112
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,590
I'm not going to pick it up there.
I'm going to pick the next one.

1113
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,700
Yeah,
I mean obviously there's a lot of 

1114
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:08,700
variables and sometimes run into the 
wrong person the wrong time.

1115
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,390
But of course,
but there's a parallel with the animal 

1116
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:13,390
world.
I mean you think about like dogs,

1117
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,981
like certain dogs.
If you're around dogs and you panic and 

1118
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:17,981
you run,
they'll chase you and bite you.

1119
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:18,970
It's like instinctive.
They can't,

1120
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,040
they almost can't help it.
Whereas if you encounter the dogs or 

1121
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,940
even some wild animals,
you know,

1122
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:29,950
and they say you have to stand your 
ground or yell at them like mountain 

1123
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:31,610
lions specially up know they say you're 
supposed to look big and make noise.

1124
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:32,270
And then I'm like,
all right,

1125
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:33,050
fuck this,
I'm out of here.

1126
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:34,630
It's too much work,
you know,

1127
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,930
they don't want to get injured.

1128
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:37,120
So they,
they,

1129
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,270
they're looking for something easy.
But when they knew,

1130
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:43,010
when they sense weakness,
I think it's almost nature,

1131
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,880
like nature wants them to go after you 
because look at this week,

1132
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,230
bitch,
he didn't,

1133
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,320
let's just eat fish.
That's what it is.

1134
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,710
I remember when I was that kid,
I was probably like 18,

1135
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:59,711
19 years old and I was uh,
I found myself in one the situation or 

1136
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:03,330
like what the fuck am I doing here?
Because I basically ended up in the 

1137
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:03,500
middle of Togo,
not exactly gangs,

1138
00:53:03,501 --> 00:53:08,501
but close to that.
They were about to get into a fight and 

1139
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:08,501
that was like west side story type 
shined up,

1140
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:13,420
you know,
so he's not reality mafia or blood and 

1141
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:13,420
canapes real gangster,
but it's,

1142
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:13,790
you know,
tough guys.

1143
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,850
Yeah.
And dealing with some guys and then 

1144
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,320
decided to group come along and I'm in 
the middle.

1145
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:24,030
Then you can really walk our way because
are a beach with Jesus,

1146
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,860
do I have to be in the middle of this 
shit?

1147
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,850
And you know,
they start in this ritualized way where 

1148
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,450
they start talking sheet and so you can 
almost set your clock is like,

1149
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:35,700
okay,
we're two minutes away from the fight.

1150
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:40,790
Right?
It's like they are going through their 

1151
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,280
dances that they're going to push that 
there's got to throw down.

1152
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,850
And I remember I was talking with some 
of these guys from quote unquote the 

1153
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:47,760
other side,
assuming that I was with one side but.

1154
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,750
And My vibe with this,
it's like,

1155
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,830
look,
if we really want to do this,

1156
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:54,270
okay fine,
let's do this.

1157
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,200
But honestly I was thinking I had a date
tonight.

1158
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:01,080
I want to go out with this woman or 
Gondola to a movie.

1159
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:05,790
I kind of rather do that than these,
but I don't know.

1160
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:06,490
Maybe you guys.
Do.

1161
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,310
You guys have nothing better to do.
I mean if we,

1162
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,650
if we don't,
let's fucking do it.

1163
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,530
You guys just sitting there having these
long sit down,

1164
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,270
have a coffee,
a little spaghetti,

1165
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:20,360
and it was largest because we tie.
The two main guys were kind of building 

1166
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:20,730
it up and by the time they turned 
around,

1167
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,230
nobody wanted to fight.
They were like,

1168
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,460
Nah,
you're right.

1169
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,410
I kind of want to do this other fuck 
days.

1170
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:28,440
I don't feel like they said it will lift
their shirt.

1171
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,030
They achieved that.
Are there like,

1172
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,000
you know,
perhaps you're right.

1173
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,650
Fuck that.
It would change.

1174
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:35,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1175
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:36,180
Because you know,
nobody has guns,

1176
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,560
so it's a chain fire,
that kind of thing.

1177
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,430
Jesus,
when know I didn't get to.

1178
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:45,770
I felt like,
okay,

1179
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,450
that was one of my better days.
If there's a fire,

1180
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,710
I played it because if you.
Again,

1181
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:52,050
if you showed too much fear then you get
squashed,

1182
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,690
but if you show too much aggressiveness,
then you invite the fight.

1183
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,270
There's also a natural thing when groups
of men meet.

1184
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:02,010
It's almost like it's a tribal thing 
that's in our DNA back to when you would

1185
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:07,011
run into people you know,
out in the field and it would turn into 

1186
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:12,081
a war,
like almost like an instinctive bonding 

1187
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:14,391
thing.
I wonder if that's where like because a 

1188
00:55:14,391 --> 00:55:17,271
lot of the most heinous atrocities that 
human beings have ever created or a 

1189
00:55:17,271 --> 00:55:20,670
committed rather they've committed in 
the process of war right now.

1190
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,360
Let me say that during the process of 
war,

1191
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:27,361
like people are capable of horrific,
terrifying things that they would never 

1192
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:31,671
do ordinarily and then also they say 
that when you have like this mob 

1193
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:37,701
mentality,
like people will do things like gang 

1194
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,760
rapes or gang murders,
gang beatings,

1195
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:39,930
lootings,
lighting,

1196
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:45,230
places on fire.
Like the behavior escalates to this 

1197
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,060
really like insane place.
Yup.

1198
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:51,380
That is very,
very rare for someone to go to on their 

1199
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,591
own as an individual and I wonder if 
that's ingrained in us because of this 

1200
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:00,320
long history of war in the human race 
that when you get a bunch of men 

1201
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,830
together and a bunch of men on the other
side,

1202
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,520
we just immediately go to fucking 
scorched earth.

1203
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:10,870
It's immediately cutting off heads and 
lighting bodies on fire and catapulting 

1204
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,850
them onto rooftops and just,
you know what I mean?

1205
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:14,390
That's like,
I know you went to these three.

1206
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,150
Does it read like game of thrones is a 
fictionalized docomo.

1207
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:23,190
It's just that some dragon,
the dragon,

1208
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:26,170
but other than that,
it's just most of human history has been

1209
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:31,171
like that and then you get into those 
things where maybe you don't want to 

1210
00:56:31,171 --> 00:56:32,050
start by.
Remember remembered those fuckers.

1211
00:56:32,051 --> 00:56:37,051
They got little johnny the other time 
and they burned the and so now you're 

1212
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:38,370
feeling to get them back.
Exactly.

1213
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,680
Then it never ends because it's the.
The other guy started it.

1214
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:43,330
I'm not choosing this game,
but hey,

1215
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,850
they started eating.
Then they remembered that you did.

1216
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:48,940
It's like you'll never get out.
I try to explain that to somebody wants.

1217
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:53,941
When I talking about street fights and 
it was saying that if you get into a 

1218
00:56:53,941 --> 00:56:55,060
fight with someone,
you're not just getting to fight.

1219
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,060
You're signing a contract that you will 
be in conflict with them back and forth 

1220
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:03,220
until it's resolved.
It's not as simple as you get in a fight

1221
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:06,610
and it's very rare that people get in a 
fight and then after that fights over,

1222
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:11,910
like it's over.
We shake hands and walk away even often 

1223
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:15,631
in a contest like a Jujitsu match or 
kickboxing mattress and one of those 

1224
00:57:15,631 --> 00:57:16,000
lines,
after it's over,

1225
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:19,300
people were still upset if they lose and
they still want to get that guy back.

1226
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,360
But a fight fight like an actual fight 
on the street fight.

1227
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,510
Oh my God,
this can go on for like the,

1228
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,310
what was the,
uh,

1229
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:28,570
the famous feud in America,
the,

1230
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,200
the hatfields and mccoys of great too 
wacky families killed each other back 

1231
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:38,230
and forth for years.
They just couldn't resolve it.

1232
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,690
Now that's why when you,
once you start is a,

1233
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,790
you'll bet there,
you know,

1234
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:47,410
but if you've got to go down that way,
then you have to go down all out.

1235
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:52,470
Then you just need to really put an end 
to that situation where nobody from the 

1236
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,720
other side can come natural.
But then,

1237
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:54,370
you know,
warrior talking genocide,

1238
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,400
that's not exactly the most pleasant 
solution in the world that you want to 

1239
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,970
get into.
But the reality is that beating somebody

1240
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:04,180
is only postponing the next fight is 
kind of like more worldwide in world war

1241
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,580
two,
he's a,

1242
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:11,130
they are mad because they got beat and 
they are reaching for a chance for 

1243
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,891
revenge.
And the fruit Stein de Abby did a jump 

1244
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:13,891
on it because they're pissed off and 
understandably so.

1245
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,140
So unless it's a resolve in some way 
where everybody can take,

1246
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,130
we're done,
right?

1247
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,890
And we know we're not saying we're 
happy,

1248
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:22,810
but can we leave with the current 
compromise,

1249
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,810
the staff that we reach after to find 
the balance of power.

1250
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:28,630
Can you live with it?
Then it becomes a lot more than.

1251
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,050
That's why World War Two,
you know,

1252
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:35,110
damn peanut tone of money into Germany 
and much of western new little buddy 

1253
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,901
building it.
They took away that resentment that 

1254
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:41,881
otherwise it would have been there or 
like those fuckers who does in this 

1255
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:42,070
situation and it ruined our life.
And that's our why.

1256
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,800
Our economy sucks.
That's why saying,

1257
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,660
you know,
being extra janitor was in that regard,

1258
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:51,661
wasn't just janitor was out of the 
goodness of your heart is because you 

1259
00:58:51,661 --> 00:58:54,301
want to make sure you don't fight world 
war three years down the road and that 

1260
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:55,780
works.
That's a good alternative to genocide.

1261
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,290
Yeah.
Smart people learned how to negotiate 

1262
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:01,290
their other.
We're gonna.

1263
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:02,050
Let's just work this out.
Let's figure out a way,

1264
00:59:02,051 --> 00:59:07,051
a mutually agreeable way where we can 
walk away and have some dignity and 

1265
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,850
it's.
It's really fascinating.

1266
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:15,290
I've had this conversation with Duncan 
wants and it was the first time I ever 

1267
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,480
thought this,
but I said that the history of the human

1268
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:20,060
race is essentially military history.
That's it.

1269
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,460
I've been obsessed with this thought 
because

1270
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:27,460
I'm next time I chat with Don Carlina.
That's what I want to bring up and the 

1271
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,510
one question I want to ask him is 
exactly about these.

1272
00:59:29,511 --> 00:59:31,940
He's like,
I love what Dan does.

1273
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:37,450
I love a lot of history.
I dig it from so many different angles 

1274
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,890
and yet why do we always end up talking 
about horrible stuff and I do.

1275
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,900
It should.
My first two episodes of history and 

1276
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:45,900
fire are all about some nest.
Yes.

1277
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:46,550
Sinks and I'm like,
same shit.

1278
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Why is it the stuff that we remember?
Why is it that the stuff that makes the 

1279
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,781
history book is old,
the horrible atrocity massacre war set 

1280
00:59:57,591 --> 01:00:02,591
people on fire?
Is it that just we don't do anything 

1281
01:00:02,591 --> 01:00:02,750
else or that it doesn't catch our 
attention?

1282
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:07,751
I wish there was a way to also put the 
spotlight in history on some more mellow

1283
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:11,510
aspects of people who figured out ways 
to live a good life in the middle of all

1284
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:14,600
the shit that was going down.
It seems so much of it is,

1285
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:17,870
as you're saying,
it's all military stuff is all fight war

1286
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:19,250
explored.
The other side.

1287
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,240
That's really the big events though.
I mean,

1288
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:25,970
when you look at the history of the 
United States,

1289
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,100
what are the events that people talk 
about?

1290
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,780
Well,
arguably the whole slavery,

1291
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:35,630
right?
Arguably that's a war because it's so.

1292
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,200
It's a war on these people's 
sovereignty.

1293
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:44,180
It's a war on their freedom and there's 
a and then a real war breaks out between

1294
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:49,181
the north and the south,
over the rights to this and then the 

1295
01:00:49,181 --> 01:00:51,320
economic aspects of it,
and then you look at World War One,

1296
01:00:51,321 --> 01:00:55,250
of course in World War Two,
so we've got to fight the Nazis and then

1297
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:59,120
we got freedom and all this.
I mean it's the entire country.

1298
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,540
The history of this country is war and 
then you go back to Europe.

1299
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:07,541
All the history of Europe is all war to 
none other than figuring out the 

1300
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,830
printing press and a bunch of different 
cool inventions.

1301
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,400
Look,
one of the great podcasts that Dan 

1302
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,940
Carlin did on history that's not 
necessarily about war is riddled with 

1303
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,291
violence that prophets of doom about 
Martin worry about war,

1304
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,160
but it is violent,
horrific,

1305
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:31,130
horrific,
amazing that horrific violence,

1306
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:33,160
but I think a lot of he's

1307
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,270
guessing that acorn because there's.
It's a cheap,

1308
01:01:36,271 --> 01:01:40,560
easy way to get people attention and so 
most of our history,

1309
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,460
it's an easy way for us to go down that 
path and I do it too,

1310
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:43,990
right?
It's.

1311
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,200
I look at 90 percent of the episodes I'm
preparing for history and fired up like,

1312
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:53,750
oh great,
you said other B had enough days that 

1313
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,090
it's either and I realize,
but why don't we,

1314
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,520
and I don't mean we as in.
I mean in general,

1315
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:59,460
there's like people who write history 
our way of thinking,

1316
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,000
why I'm not denying that part,
that's an important part and we should 

1317
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,481
look at it,
but why don't we also look at other 

1318
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:10,521
things.
It's like what's wrong with the study 

1319
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:10,521
and about,
you know,

1320
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:14,540
putting the accent moron stuff about 
people dropping acid and having sex 

1321
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,081
outside of marriage a lot more and 
listening to cool music and coming out 

1322
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,070
with Jimi Hendrix.
And why is that that less than

1323
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,690
the Cold War?
Uh,

1324
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,820
it's not,
to me that just is,

1325
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:28,790
I mean our many people's life as he 
transformed away a lot,

1326
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:30,630
lot as has,
as you know,

1327
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:35,631
sometimes we think was president in the 
history in most of our lives.

1328
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:41,190
Who's president these most mildly 
important at most.

1329
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,640
And there are so many other things that 
count for so much more.

1330
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,800
But why is it that then when we write 
the history,

1331
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:51,801
it's about precedent and our world war 
took place when there's so much other 

1332
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,090
stuff in our lives that count for more,
isn't the,

1333
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,180
when we were talking about the sixties 
isn't a big part of the sixties or the 

1334
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,950
Vietnam War and the resistance to the 
Vietnam War and that sort of fueled that

1335
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:05,810
sort of crazy hippie behavior because 
they realize that these old assholes and

1336
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,820
they're shitty stupid ways I'd led us 
into the South Pacific and it's crazy 

1337
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,460
war that nobody wanted.

1338
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,500
I mean,
that's a big part,

1339
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:15,960
I think,
of the rebellion of the 19 sixties.

1340
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:19,710
It's almost unavoidable because that's 
the worst thing that can happen.

1341
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:25,020
See,
the worst thing that can happen is 

1342
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:25,020
someone kills you or kills your loved 
ones.

1343
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,190
Right?
So when that happens in mass,

1344
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,900
you know,
like in war,

1345
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:32,990
well,
that those become the biggest blips on 

1346
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:32,990
the social radar.
That's.

1347
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:32,990
Yeah,
you're right.

1348
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:35,840
So I guess just.
Well,

1349
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,440
it's kind of seems like it's 
unavoidable,

1350
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,770
unavoidable.
It seems like,

1351
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:46,380
at least historically,
I'm not saying about for the future,

1352
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:50,520
but war seemed unavoidable because it 
was never avoided.

1353
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,210
Yeah,
I mean,

1354
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:55,620
it's hard to argue that war is avoidable
when it's never been avoided.

1355
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,140
It's like you kind of at a certain point
in time,

1356
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,190
you know,
if,

1357
01:03:59,220 --> 01:03:59,520
if,
uh,

1358
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,800
like if a girl acts like can't all the 
time,

1359
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,280
she's always screaming and yelling and 
clawing and pulling chicks Harris.

1360
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:06,190
And she's like,
I'm not a con,

1361
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,240
but you're a con every day because if 
you were today,

1362
01:04:12,091 --> 01:04:16,110
you were the day before the fucking 
keyed three people's cars today.

1363
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:19,520
You threw a fucking bag out the window.
You're,

1364
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,600
yeah.
I'm glad you don't feel that way,

1365
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:26,020
but the happiness seems to save me.
I don't understand you.

1366
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:26,990
Okay,
well we're.

1367
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:28,620
People are war like,
no we're not.

1368
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,360
We're not.
Uh,

1369
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,120
we're not okay,
but human history says you're wrong.

1370
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:36,870
It really does.
Like there's not a single moment in time

1371
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:40,170
in human history where someone somewhere
wasn't killing.

1372
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:40,800
Like,
okay,

1373
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:46,530
let's look at this way.
I believe firmly that if you mean Jamie 

1374
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:50,750
all lived together on an island,
we would not kill each other if we had 

1375
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,820
plenty of food and we didn't.
We didn't argue over resources.

1376
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:59,030
We got along great.
I don't think we would kill each other 

1377
01:04:59,030 --> 01:04:59,030
assuming that there are at least three 
women there.

1378
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,550
At least one girl that's got a lot of 
endurance.

1379
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,020
That could work as well.
That could also do it,

1380
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:09,530
but even if there wasn't right,
we just went,

1381
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,640
jerked off in bushes for the rest of our
lives.

1382
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,490
If you would,
you would say,

1383
01:05:14,491 --> 01:05:17,010
okay,
the odds of us killing each other or

1384
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,980
extremely small,
so if there was only three of us on the 

1385
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:22,980
planet,
there will be no war right there a bit.

1386
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,320
We'd be no war,
but as soon as you get more than three,

1387
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,560
as soon as you get more than 10,
like if there was 10 of us,

1388
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,810
it was 10 of us will live on an island.
Man.

1389
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,080
The odds of somebody getting jacked,
it's.

1390
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:35,830
It goes up.
They start to,

1391
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,430
you get to 20.
Ooh.

1392
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,220
Things get weird.
Something could happen.

1393
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,060
Things get weird habit of his 20th 
[inaudible],

1394
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,480
17 are guys and three or woman,
someone's going to die at that point.

1395
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,670
It's not even a debate.
It's a number thing,

1396
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:51,790
right?
Like you get to a certain certain number

1397
01:05:51,791 --> 01:05:56,650
of people and then war becomes 
inevitable and there's never been a time

1398
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:01,710
ever in the history of the human race 
where someone somewhere wasn't killing 

1399
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:03,360
somebody is literally never happened 
there.

1400
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,570
Not that we know of.
Right.

1401
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:09,690
Well,
you and I need to read the Bible and go 

1402
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:11,200
back to the time of Jesus.
Adam and eve never did anything.

1403
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:11,890
Do we?
There they were.

1404
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,540
I think there's a certain point in time 
where you,

1405
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:20,541
you know,
you go back and people were essentially 

1406
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:23,071
dealing with predators and that might've
been the only time where we're killing 

1407
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:23,071
each other.
Yup.

1408
01:06:23,071 --> 01:06:24,460
We're just constantly worried about 
getting eaten.

1409
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,580
Right,
exactly.

1410
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,850
But even then like,
like giraffes kill each other,

1411
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,230
like I didn't know until this year that 
giraffes kill each other and all that.

1412
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,940
I just found out now,
dude,

1413
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:39,520
you got to see the way they do it.
They do pd each other with their necks.

1414
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,060
They use their head like a whip,
you know those,

1415
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,730
those weird knobs that they have on 
their heads.

1416
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:47,800
They whip each other with those things.

1417
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,940
They use their head like literally like 
a whip and they.

1418
01:06:50,980 --> 01:06:53,440
It's the weirdest thing to pull that 
shit up.

1419
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:54,670
Jamie.
They beat.

1420
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:57,920
They beat each other to death though.
Like commonly beat each other.

1421
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,060
Zf jobs wound healed until I started 
hunting.

1422
01:07:01,061 --> 01:07:02,980
I didn't know that deer's kill each 
other all the time.

1423
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,210
They stab each other all the time,
so fucking horrible.

1424
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:11,380
It's dog eat dog world.
You imagine you grow swords on your head

1425
01:07:11,381 --> 01:07:13,030
and just running around stabbing each 
other,

1426
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,800
but.
But giraffes,

1427
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,440
it's so odd to do it because it's a 
whipping thing.

1428
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:18,220
Look.
See?

1429
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:19,510
They whip each other.
Look at that.

1430
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:26,130
Look at this thing saying they stand 
side decide and they push on each other 

1431
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,310
and then they whip each other with their
heads.

1432
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,650
What have you seen q right now?
He's like,

1433
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,210
okay.
I thought they'd do.

1434
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:33,430
It seems like it sped up.
Jamie,

1435
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,650
is it sped up?
Wow.

1436
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,060
Oh,
it's not sped up.

1437
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:38,980
No,
it is sped up that up.

1438
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:39,520
Yeah.

1439
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,600
It's so weird.
This is not sped up.

1440
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,460
Okay.
This one's not sped up.

1441
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:50,490
That's more realistic.
I think the first one in the video 

1442
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:50,970
series of direct,
what is the name of this video?

1443
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,270
A giraffes fighting draft battles,
but they.

1444
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,390
They always do it the same way.
They go side to side.

1445
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:03,590
She was like two dudes standing shoulder
to shoulder and then it head butting 

1446
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:04,300
each other.
Yeah.

1447
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:09,301
It's so strange man,
and these guys have placed are clean 

1448
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:12,700
chimneys one the previous ones wearing 
these side to side walk each other and 

1449
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,170
then they take five cycles where they 
are thinking about the next,

1450
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:19,171
but look to get back to the same 
position that always get back to the 

1451
01:08:19,171 --> 01:08:19,340
shoulder to shoulder position.
When they clinch up,

1452
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:24,370
it's just to get back to this side by 
side position so they can fucking head 

1453
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:24,440
butting each other.

1454
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:28,040
So strange article or.
And they use their head.

1455
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,320
They used their head to the body,
see the attack,

1456
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:34,010
the body with those antlers that William
like nubs,

1457
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,500
whatever it is,
but they'll go to the same spot over and

1458
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:38,300
over again,
like right to the rib cage.

1459
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,510
Can you imagine anything?
Giraffes had actually like deer antlers.

1460
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,300
They will just go there.
Would,

1461
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,340
but see if you go to the zoo,
you would never imagined.

1462
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:52,370
This takes place now because one of the 
cool things about giraffes is that 

1463
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,600
they're an animal that's so universally 
gentle.

1464
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:56,060
Yup.
That you can have babies feed them.

1465
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:58,970
Like my daughter when she was two years 
old,

1466
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,360
we let her do.
They give you a lettuce and you hold out

1467
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:05,490
the lettuce and the giraffe comes over 
with his crazy tongue.

1468
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,500
It's like an arm and they reach out 
their tongue and wraps it around the 

1469
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,391
leaves and it pulls it,
but they're so confident in their 

1470
01:09:13,391 --> 01:09:14,750
behavior around people that they let 
babies feed them,

1471
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:18,050
but you get these two motherfuckers 
together and they fight over some pussy.

1472
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,790
That's what he told her latest,
but it's not.

1473
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:23,700
It's exactly what this is.
That's exactly what the dea,

1474
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,280
the deer don't fight.
You know,

1475
01:09:25,281 --> 01:09:28,580
deer get together and bachelor groups 
when they're not breeding,

1476
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,130
when the run is over and they are and 
their buddies,

1477
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:36,610
they're all buddies together.
That's like one of the best ways that 

1478
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,670
people hunt them out of the Rut is to 
find bachelor groups and then you're 

1479
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,210
done with those pitches.
They don't even hang out with.

1480
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:46,450
Soon as they get done fighting.
As soon as they'd done fighting and 

1481
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:46,450
fucking and they were like,
let's just hang out guys,

1482
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,380
come on,
let's go wander through the countryside.

1483
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:50,120
It's go camp.
Let's go hang out,

1484
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,190
tell some stories.
Come on guys.

1485
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,860
I know we stabbed each other a couple of
weeks ago,

1486
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:57,020
but that's over bro.
It survive.

1487
01:09:57,021 --> 01:10:00,530
I survive because they said they heal up
quick too.

1488
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:05,530
That's another bizarre thing about deer.
So they'll stab each other and they put 

1489
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:09,851
these horrible gases in their body and 
then like a week later it's completely 

1490
01:10:09,851 --> 01:10:11,390
sealed up and they're just walking 
around like nothing happened.

1491
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:13,760
Was vetting power.
Just they just super,

1492
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:19,030
super high metabolism and probably just.
They only live like seven years.

1493
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:24,910
So I think whatever injuries,
they have seals up quick because there 

1494
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:29,381
was this video of this guy.
He went bow hunting and he missed this 

1495
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:30,050
deer.
He missed a good spot.

1496
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:30,510
He,
you know,

1497
01:10:30,511 --> 01:10:32,540
he missed the vitals that he hit it in 
the shoulder,

1498
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:37,750
so the deer got an arrow in his shoulder
and then they found the deer a week 

1499
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,640
later walking around like nothing.
Just.

1500
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:40,370
I really narrowed that off.
Oh,

1501
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:41,830
it fell out,
fell off the,

1502
01:10:41,831 --> 01:10:43,790
the,
the hole in the shoulder healed up.

1503
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,530
Just sealed,
sealed itself.

1504
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,150
It's like what the fuck,
but achy.

1505
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,050
Well,
to just,

1506
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:49,890
they have to be like that.
Yeah.

1507
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:54,891
That wasn't bad.
And their worlds to getting stabbed all 

1508
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:57,641
the time by swords of these dudes are 
growing on their heads that were 

1509
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:00,730
competing for sex and competing for.
That goes back to my point,

1510
01:11:00,731 --> 01:11:03,400
if there were giraffe who curse or 
digging,

1511
01:11:03,401 --> 01:11:08,401
are hookers?
This guy who had said that they get 

1512
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:10,981
along well.
The crazy thing about deer is it's not 

1513
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:10,981
about like,
it's not just about sex,

1514
01:11:10,981 --> 01:11:13,290
it's literally only about sex one time a
year.

1515
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,410
You just want to resist.
The pressure is like,

1516
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,240
oh,
this is my one chance man.

1517
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,100
And I only live seven years.
So I this,

1518
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:20,440
this,
the,

1519
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:23,430
I really everybody live three,
four or five at most.

1520
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,410
So most,
if you're in my way,

1521
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:27,990
I'm going to fucking kill you.
I don't know.

1522
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,790
Most of them,
they freeze to death.

1523
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,950
They freeze to death or starve to death.

1524
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,950
Like they'll wear their teeth down to 
nothing and they can no longer process 

1525
01:11:36,950 --> 01:11:37,890
grains.
That's a good way to go.

1526
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:42,990
It happens to a lot of deer,
like a lot of people will kill an old 

1527
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:45,801
dear.
And then they opened its mouth up and 

1528
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:45,801
they go,
wow.

1529
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:46,260
He would've never made it through the 
winter because their teeth are gone.

1530
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,320
They still have a very finite resource 
with those teeth and at that point 

1531
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,701
you're really doing them a favor because
that's a way to go by this little 

1532
01:11:55,701 --> 01:11:58,650
starvation that's fuck it up.
Or they get even worse.

1533
01:11:58,651 --> 01:12:01,080
They're on their way to getting starved 
and the coyotes find them.

1534
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,140
Yeah,
they're weak and then you'll get eaten 

1535
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:06,140
alive.
Yes,

1536
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,290
asshole first.
That's how they get you outta.

1537
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:09,620
There was a thing that I tweeted today,
Jamie,

1538
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:14,070
you see the thing about there's a 
literally a new species that is evolving

1539
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:14,940
before our eyes.

1540
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:19,020
It's a mix of coyotes,
wolves and dogs and domestic dogs.

1541
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:24,300
And that a hybrid of these three is 
incredibly successful and it's like the 

1542
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:29,570
Koi wolves are coyotes and wolves and 
we've known about them for awhile and 

1543
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,830
that's really a fascinating thing 
because it's a larger coyote,

1544
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:36,860
but look at this new species,
new species evolving right before our 

1545
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:39,120
eyes and ultra successful mix of wolves,
coyotes and dogs,

1546
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:43,440
so really interesting article,
but it's an actual.

1547
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:48,550
Is this from the economist?
This is actually their mating with each 

1548
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:53,301
other and they're creating an actual 
species really fast.

1549
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:54,780
Wow.
That's 3:00

1550
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:59,780
PM.
The embedding began up to 200 years ago 

1551
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,601
is European settlers pushed into 
southern Ontario and cleared the 

1552
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:05,961
animals' habitat for farming and killed 
a large number of wolves that lived 

1553
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:09,351
there.
It also allowed coyotes to spread from 

1554
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,880
the prairies and the white farmers 
brought dogs into the region.

1555
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:16,880
Over time,
wolves began meeting with their new 

1556
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,370
genetically similar neighbors and the 
resulting offspring which had been 

1557
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:22,580
called the eastern coyote or to some the
Coi wolf now number in the millions.

1558
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:26,340
According to research at North Carolina 
State University.

1559
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,650
This is really interesting stuff,
man.

1560
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,920
That's crazy.
Fifty five pounds now.

1561
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:37,590
Told no 437.
This is cool.

1562
01:13:37,730 --> 01:13:42,730
And an analysis of 437 hybrid animals 
found that the coyote DNA dominates its 

1563
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:48,600
genetic makeup with about one 10th of 
its DNA from dogs,

1564
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:53,520
usually from a larger dog such as 
Doberman pinchers and German shepherds,

1565
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,130
and a quarter from wolves.
Wow.

1566
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,400
That's freaky.
Began that building size compared to a 

1567
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:01,830
big.
Yeah.

1568
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:02,810
It's just,
it's,

1569
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,960
it's,
it's fascinating to think how a species 

1570
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,470
evolved in the first place.
Like how did a wolf become a wolf?

1571
01:14:10,471 --> 01:14:12,010
You know,
how did a giraffe become a

1572
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
giraffe and to see something like this 
happening and have a very clear line,

1573
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,390
like a genetic line.
Right?

1574
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,950
This is what caused.
This is amazing stuff,

1575
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,050
man.
It's fucking trippy though.

1576
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:24,700
Sure.
That's always.

1577
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:27,100
Would you wonder about if we're going 
wrong,

1578
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,080
when you see those Adam,
you know,

1579
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,700
you think about wolves and then you some
of the dog species today.

1580
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:32,380
I'm like,
how the fuck did you come about?

1581
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:35,610
You're not suited for anything.
It's like,

1582
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,420
and they've been doing it for thousands 
of years.

1583
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:42,440
That's a modern dog has been around for 
thousands of years and we didn't even 

1584
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,910
know the original origin,
like there's a lot of speculation.

1585
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,700
They believe that the wolves that were 
around human beings,

1586
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:53,701
they became,
they became different because they 

1587
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:56,461
wanted the people to like them,
so they became the more successful ones 

1588
01:14:56,461 --> 01:14:59,250
that stayed were the ones that are a 
little more timid and more Beta playful.

1589
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,400
They did a study on Fox is really 
interesting study that they highlighted 

1590
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,541
in this radio lab podcast,
but they were talking about genetic 

1591
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:13,220
diversity and genetic diversity and 
foxes were,

1592
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:18,240
they only allowed the foxes that were 
timid and um,

1593
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:24,300
and like more more accepting of human be
human touch and to be around humans they

1594
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:28,750
only allowed them to live and they sort 
of like bread.

1595
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,040
Those let those breed with other ones.
And over like 10 years,

1596
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:38,160
they had completely changed the Fox Dna.
I had completely changed the point with 

1597
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,160
their ears.
No,

1598
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,300
we're no longer pointed.
They flopped.

1599
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,400
They didn't stick straight up.
They flop.

1600
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,400
Their jaws became more feminine in any 
hours.

1601
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:47,380
Yeah.
And their color started changing nuts.

1602
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,550
Yeah.
Ten years.

1603
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,280
It's like generations maybe for folks 
that's or something.

1604
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:52,140
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1605
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:57,300
I mean probably more than three 
generations because generation isn't 

1606
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:57,300
exactly the entire lifetime.

1607
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,140
It's like how long it takes you to breed
into successful.

1608
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,450
Maybe might have been a capital offense 
or something,

1609
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:02,750
so maybe five.
Regeneration.

1610
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,850
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1611
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:04,990
It's not much.
Yeah,

1612
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:06,370
five generations.
There's nothing.

1613
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:08,800
Well,
that's what they're finding now more and

1614
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:13,801
more the more they study life is it life
can evolve and change and shift and 

1615
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:17,590
adapt incredibly quickly.
Oh my favorite story of that.

1616
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:22,591
As the Congo,
the Congo used to be like a grassland 

1617
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:25,750
savanna and then the climate changed.
It became this really lush rain forest,

1618
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:29,080
but a lot of these animals that were 
like savannah animals,

1619
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:31,150
they got trapped right now.
They are stuck.

1620
01:16:31,151 --> 01:16:36,151
They're stuck inside this rain forest,
so like there's this BBC documentary on 

1621
01:16:36,151 --> 01:16:39,040
the Congo and one of the cool things is 
seeing this swampy,

1622
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:44,041
crazy rain forest and then seeing these 
deer run through the water of the rain 

1623
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,370
forest,
these antelopes and you're like,

1624
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:50,610
whoa.
Different supposed to be in grasslands 

1625
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:53,530
and they're just trapped in this 
insanely dense rain forest.

1626
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:57,340
The,
they change a anything like their habits

1627
01:16:57,341 --> 01:17:02,341
there.
Anything about their physical features 

1628
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:02,341
that was there.
Some of them,

1629
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:05,290
one of them is called a diker and dikers
are very small antelope,

1630
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:09,160
but he can swim underwater for up to 100
yards and it eats

1631
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,500
the hell.
What the hell?

1632
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:18,570
No,
what I would picture a hundred yards 

1633
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:18,570
underwater.
Underwater.

1634
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:23,320
That's what the fuck it's.
It became something that adapted to that

1635
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:26,240
environment.
They can eat fish,

1636
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:31,330
but they found that deer eat birds.
They didn't know that until really 

1637
01:17:31,330 --> 01:17:32,630
recently.
And one of the ways they found it,

1638
01:17:32,650 --> 01:17:35,780
it was through camera traps because you 
know,

1639
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,430
they have these camera,
um,

1640
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:42,940
these trail cams that people put up when
they're hunting and that when they put 

1641
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:47,021
up these trail cams,
as the trail cams got more and more 

1642
01:17:47,021 --> 01:17:47,330
sophisticated,
they started using video trail cameras.

1643
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:51,650
And as the video trail cameras started,
they get the data back from them.

1644
01:17:51,651 --> 01:17:54,410
They started finding like occasionally 
birds,

1645
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:56,720
like deer would eat ground nesting 
birds.

1646
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,570
Yeah.
Soda need my Ds and they find,

1647
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:05,060
Oh,
told me to beat the shit out of each 

1648
01:18:05,060 --> 01:18:08,081
other.
That direct birds that are no 

1649
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:08,081
certainties in life anymore.

1650
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:09,020
No.
They're all evil.

1651
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:14,021
Those goddamn animals.
The ones that we have anthropomorphize 

1652
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:16,490
these beautiful creatures that exist 
solely on the power of love.

1653
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:17,570
Yep.
Yeah.

1654
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:19,920
There was a.
They did some sort of a,

1655
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,950
a study where they were capturing 
certain birds with nets and they had set

1656
01:18:24,951 --> 01:18:29,951
the nets up and the birds around the 
nets and get caught with the deer would 

1657
01:18:29,951 --> 01:18:30,500
just walk right up to the birds and the 
nuts and just start eating them.

1658
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,810
Wow.
Just chewing them alive while they're in

1659
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:37,811
the net.
Just so much more to eating a sentiment 

1660
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:40,700
about the era and it.
Because it wasn't like they were just 

1661
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:40,700
testing,
like trying that.

1662
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,110
Alec is this food though?
They just went right to it.

1663
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:47,400
They like so dear.
Apparently eat ground nesting birds all 

1664
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,891
the time,
but being at ground nesting bird that 

1665
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:52,250
looks like shit.
Let that just bad evolution right there.

1666
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:53,630
Dog Shit.
Life.

1667
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:57,230
What were you thinking at bird delete on
the ground.

1668
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:02,260
That just a bad idea.
Don't you know how to put sticks and 

1669
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:02,260
twigs and the trees.
You dumb fuck the other.

1670
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,980
That helps a lot.
Like where I live,

1671
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:06,610
there's a regular,
an older list on a monthly basis.

1672
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:09,160
There's like some cute with the little 
birds,

1673
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,410
Nesting da egg Saracini and devotees.
He got into hall,

1674
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:17,411
could regularly come by us,
reap the shit out of them and I find 

1675
01:19:17,411 --> 01:19:18,890
pieces of birds everywhere and it's 
pretty nasty.

1676
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:24,190
Yeah.
My friend Tom was sitting out on his 

1677
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,310
back porch who was one of the directors 
of news radio back in the day.

1678
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,210
Tom's a great guy and he was an in 
studio city and he goes,

1679
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,340
sit down.
He had this sort of Georgia accent.

1680
01:19:31,341 --> 01:19:36,341
I'm sitting on my porch enjoying my 
coffee and I see a dove or some sort of 

1681
01:19:37,321 --> 01:19:40,700
a bird.
Maybe it was a dove sitting on the fence

1682
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,240
and then add a nowhere hot comes and 
snatches that Burrito and he goes and 

1683
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,550
part of me felt lucky to see that.
Yeah,

1684
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,380
lucky because that doesn't happen every 
day,

1685
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:55,780
but it also like made you realize like 
it's hard out there for a tough war.

1686
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:59,810
Yes,
and birds eat birds.

1687
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:05,140
That's another fuck up.
That diverse thought of that I saw not 

1688
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:06,150
so long ago.
It's coming back home and die.

1689
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,280
Yardies bird just yapping

1690
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,170
away just making these crazy noise.
I'm like,

1691
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:15,171
what the hell?
And I look up into three and acds one 

1692
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:15,171
burgess,
just mad.

1693
01:20:15,171 --> 01:20:17,100
Just going there and then I see that 
right next to it,

1694
01:20:17,101 --> 01:20:22,101
like maybe 10 feet away.
There's this hawk that does another 

1695
01:20:22,101 --> 01:20:23,160
burden.
He smiles that look exactly like the one

1696
01:20:23,161 --> 01:20:28,161
that Seattle lean.
So this one is probably like saying he 

1697
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:28,161
was set off a beach which are just 
teaching my wife.

1698
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:30,090
That's not right.
It's like I was like,

1699
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:32,730
man,
that's a rough life right there.

1700
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:33,660
Yeah.
Hawks,

1701
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:34,440
Jack,
everybody.

1702
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:35,880
Yup.
Everybody gets jacked.

1703
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,650
Except I saw youtube a video for 
committing suicide by Eagle.

1704
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:44,520
The site with an eagle's nest and oh no,
not a good idea.

1705
01:20:44,521 --> 01:20:49,521
You see these eagle who was just like 
minding his business is this big Bald 

1706
01:20:49,521 --> 01:20:49,680
Eagle.
And then clearly before even the camera,

1707
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:55,120
because the camera,
I guess was set on the nest to capture 

1708
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,120
whatever was going on there.

1709
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,610
You see these eagle just suddenly see 
something,

1710
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:02,090
a bus up like ready for the fight and 
the next day you've seen is this hawk 

1711
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:05,811
coming in,
just fighting with the ego and it lasts 

1712
01:21:05,811 --> 01:21:06,420
about six seconds as they go.
Just go whack,

1713
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:11,421
whack.
And just the reap the Hawk to pieces 

1714
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:11,421
because it's like I'm glad you'll be 
told the other birds.

1715
01:21:11,421 --> 01:21:12,990
But an eagle is an eagle.
Step away.

1716
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:15,850
You're beginning to overestimate your 
skills.

1717
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:19,060
Math got drunk.
Yeah.

1718
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:20,680
Drunk.
So take on an eagle.

1719
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:23,220
It's fermented berries or something.
Fuck it.

1720
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:24,930
A golden days thinking they are all 
that.

1721
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,020
I'm going to show them right now.
And that did not work.

1722
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,110
It's interesting that birds fly in 
flocks,

1723
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:36,111
right?
Like Canadian geese and ducks and 

1724
01:21:36,111 --> 01:21:36,750
sparrows,
but not the ones that eat meat.

1725
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:39,210
No meat.
You're on your own bitch.

1726
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:40,350
Yup.
You know,

1727
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,740
there's probably these,
a competition about that flesh.

1728
01:21:46,260 --> 01:21:50,520
Somebody eating that meat just changes 
the whole dynamic of the situation.

1729
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:55,550
The ones that eat the meat,
a spicket of which after seeing your 

1730
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,400
instagram picture of your dinner,
I'm like,

1731
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:01,660
I,
I'm going to be knocking on the Oregon 

1732
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:01,660
side for you.
Fuck,

1733
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,660
I wish I had gone to the.
I have to get some,

1734
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,640
but uh,
I have a freezer in the back.

1735
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:07,830
I'll hook you up next time I see you.
I'll bring you some elk stack.

1736
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,350
Be Able to love it.
I'll teach you how to cook it too.

1737
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:15,430
It's a little different because there's 
very little fat so you have to cook it 

1738
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:15,430
quick.
The easiest to.

1739
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:17,310
I'll give you some ground elk.
Is the easiest to cook.

1740
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:19,950
Like elk burgers,
super high protein too.

1741
01:22:19,951 --> 01:22:24,951
It's like,
I'm think it's 22 grams of protein per 

1742
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:28,650
pound,
which is way more than domestic beef.

1743
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,000
Right?

1744
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:34,410
It's like between,
I think the highest is elk and the 

1745
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,040
second highest is Moose.
Like those are the highest of the,

1746
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:39,630
that type of animal that you can get,
but it's really delicious.

1747
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:40,740
Two minutes.
So good.

1748
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,840
I love them.
So good for you too.

1749
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:47,520
And you don't have to feel guilty about 
factory farming and all that other.

1750
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,140
Exactly,
I mean if you're to eat meat,

1751
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:54,290
might as well.
It's bad that wild and had a good life 

1752
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:55,110
and that's it.
Do you know factory farming sucks?

1753
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,850
Have you ever seen an eagle in the wild?
Um,

1754
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:58,980
yeah,
yeah.

1755
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,180
Wild to see.
Right?

1756
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:01,530
When you see one in real life,
you're like,

1757
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:02,730
God,
this is big.

1758
01:23:02,731 --> 01:23:03,630
And South Dakota.
Yeah,

1759
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,130
I've seen South Dakota,
there's

1760
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,130
a crazy video online from Alaska,
have this kid and his whole family is 

1761
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:17,440
there.
Their lawn is covered with bald eagles 

1762
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,350
and they were throwing out fish.
They had like some salmon,

1763
01:23:20,351 --> 01:23:24,820
so they had filleted the salmon and then
they had the bottoms in the ribs and the

1764
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:25,860
heads and all that stuff.
And they were,

1765
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:31,090
they had thrown it out for these eagles 
and their fucking lawn is just 

1766
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:35,400
overwhelmed with bald eagles.
So we like to think of Bald Eagles is 

1767
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,110
like spinning something like extremely 
endangered and protected.

1768
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,630
Alaska is a different story.
Totally different story.

1769
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,760
They're protected in some places,
right?

1770
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,740
But in Alaska they're not protected.
I mean,

1771
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,910
not,
not to not protect,

1772
01:23:45,911 --> 01:23:47,950
I should say they're endangered in a lot
of places,

1773
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:50,050
but they're not in danger and Alaska.
They're still protected.

1774
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:50,610
Yeah,
I know.

1775
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:51,880
Like,
look at all these.

1776
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:53,910
No Way.
Yeah.

1777
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,170
So what's the name of this video?
Jamie?

1778
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,780
It says 1:00
PM on a summer night.

1779
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,850
And um,
how was it?

1780
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:03,020
A summer night.
Oh,

1781
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:05,230
you can't see the other one?
I was like,

1782
01:24:05,231 --> 01:24:05,980
you and breads.

1783
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,680
It's not night just because it's pm.
Look at all these eagles,

1784
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:16,681
man in the.
Those are the ones that aren't black 

1785
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:18,340
with a white.
Those are the immature ones,

1786
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:23,860
the young ones and some.
Sometimes those young ones are fucking 

1787
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:23,860
enormous man.
Yeah.

1788
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,510
They don't want to look smart,
that's for sure.

1789
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:28,900
Now they're all over this guy's lawn and
uh,

1790
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:33,901
they,
they throw like these buckets of fish 

1791
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:33,970
out for them,
but they have,

1792
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,310
you know,
eagles all over the place up there.

1793
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,810
Yeah.
California.

1794
01:24:37,811 --> 01:24:39,670
We have some eagles still.
We have Golden Eagles.

1795
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:40,870
They,
they still find them,

1796
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:42,880
but they're just not,
for whatever reason,

1797
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:45,040
not nearly as common as they are up 
there in Alaska.

1798
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,650
I guess it's also probably because they 
have a lot of food up there with all the

1799
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:52,651
salmon salmon runs.
This is just one part of the video.

1800
01:24:54,111 --> 01:24:55,950
This video is pretty long,
but see they're,

1801
01:24:55,951 --> 01:24:59,270
they're sitting around waiting for this 
guy to chuck like fish heads.

1802
01:24:59,271 --> 01:24:59,750
For them

1803
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:07,790
it's just an amazing animal.
This animal,

1804
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:12,791
this is flying raptor.
That really is probably exactly like 

1805
01:25:12,861 --> 01:25:16,970
what the dinosaurs are like.
It's fascinating when they find more and

1806
01:25:16,971 --> 01:25:21,971
more evidence that many dinosaurs had 
feathers and you think there's really 

1807
01:25:21,971 --> 01:25:26,531
probably not much difference between 
some birds like eagles and some 

1808
01:25:26,571 --> 01:25:29,120
dinosaurs.
And then they know that some birds,

1809
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:34,280
even birds that lived a fairly recently,
like the terror birds,

1810
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:38,990
they were uh,
these large flightless six foot,

1811
01:25:38,991 --> 01:25:41,990
seven foot tall birds just going to go 
for the head look at.

1812
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,650
Should I get that head?
I want to get that habit,

1813
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,660
that fucking do with camera.
So He's thinking about it.

1814
01:25:47,661 --> 01:25:49,700
Look at his little baby steps up.
Pussy,

1815
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,790
Pussy.
No head for you.

1816
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:57,791
Faggot.
Swooping in and try to do it is this one

1817
01:25:59,511 --> 01:26:00,740
is more mature.
Yeah.

1818
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:03,110
He's got a little bit more confidence.
Jack,

1819
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,260
you go,
love

1820
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:04,990
it.
Lovely.

1821
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,600
Just swoop in and grab it.
Kinda damned.

1822
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,670
They're awesome animals.
I'm,

1823
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:10,490
I just,
I,

1824
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:15,640
I find the world of nature to be 
unbelievably beautiful and exciting and 

1825
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:18,890
crazy,
but for whatever reason,

1826
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:22,730
I'm way more thrilled by the predators.
Yeah,

1827
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:24,890
like the,
like when I see things like this,

1828
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:27,860
when I see like raptors,
that's what excites me.

1829
01:26:27,861 --> 01:26:30,560
If I see like some sparrows or something
like that,

1830
01:26:30,570 --> 01:26:34,330
this pussy as we kind of related more in
the science of,

1831
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:39,520
you know,
as human beings we have hunting and 

1832
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,750
gathering has been 95 percent would have
been around a while.

1833
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:44,160
We did.
It's what has been the norm of,

1834
01:26:44,161 --> 01:26:46,220
for human beings for the longest period 
of time.

1835
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:51,270
Yeah.
But there's just something about 

1836
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:52,721
dangerous things.
I want to show you this picture that 

1837
01:26:52,721 --> 01:26:54,641
certainly sent me a.
This a family friend has um,

1838
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,840
uh,
chickens and they caught a bobcat eating

1839
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,090
their chicken.
Get this fucker Jamie.

1840
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

1841
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,480
Hold it up to the camera and see if 
people could see it.

1842
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,800
This is a,
this is like,

1843
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:11,780
I think they live in woodland hills.
Yeah.

1844
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:16,810
They're so far away from here at all.
That's what's today is that now for the 

1845
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:21,281
longest time I live closer to the water.
Now that I'm leaving them kind of close 

1846
01:27:21,281 --> 01:27:21,360
to Glendale,
to the heel,

1847
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:22,670
subpoena ego.
They're all kind of stuff.

1848
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:28,270
It's crazy.
The stuff that you'll find running 

1849
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:29,000
around in the middle of houses,
you live everywhere and skunks.

1850
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,380
The other day.
I'm yesterday with Katie.

1851
01:27:33,381 --> 01:27:34,460
Larry's.
I'm coming back home.

1852
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:36,620
I was teaching a night class,
so I come back home.

1853
01:27:36,621 --> 01:27:38,930
It's probably like 10,
30 pm or something.

1854
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:41,030
I arrive,
I'm walking through my garden.

1855
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:46,070
It's pitch black and just maybe 20 feet 
to my right a year or just something 

1856
01:27:47,751 --> 01:27:48,860
good out at me.
Right,

1857
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:54,190
and I don't know.
It completely skipped my rational brain 

1858
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:57,281
that there was no thought in my mind.
The next thing I hear is this meanare 

1859
01:27:57,281 --> 01:27:57,980
heavier growl and I realize,
oh wait,

1860
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,210
that's me.
It's me,

1861
01:27:59,510 --> 01:28:04,370
that whatever other fucking thing was 
there I just pissed off.

1862
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:09,371
Right.
I never know because whatever the other 

1863
01:28:09,371 --> 01:28:09,371
things was decided.
Okay,

1864
01:28:09,371 --> 01:28:10,670
you're fucking crazy or to me.
So I believe it because I added.

1865
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:12,620
I honestly don't think he was anything 
big.

1866
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:17,621
I think he was probably like some piece 
of record and tried to show that they 

1867
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:17,621
are.

1868
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:18,820
They are not really.
I don't think he was anything.

1869
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:23,940
Koons will fight you though because I 
would have grabbed if they want you to 

1870
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:27,250
come after you,
but they're not and they don't because 

1871
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:27,250
they are small so they mind their 
business.

1872
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:29,260
Mountain Lion wouldn't and it's very 
rare anyway,

1873
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,160
so it's probably stupid raccoon or 
something.

1874
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,200
You probably got too close to his 
garbage stash.

1875
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,510
Exactly.
He was all trying to.

1876
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,850
This was a Bobcat,
this,

1877
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:41,060
this fucking crazy mangy looking creepy 
animal and like I said,

1878
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:46,061
this is like real close to where the 
studio is and this is a guy had a 

1879
01:28:46,061 --> 01:28:50,141
chicken coop and this thing figured out 
how to get in his chicken coop and was 

1880
01:28:50,141 --> 01:28:52,220
eating one of his chickens and his coop 
and found it creepy looking face on that

1881
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:53,300
fucker.
Out of that.

1882
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:55,960
It looks like a mean bus.
Oh,

1883
01:28:55,970 --> 01:28:57,820
he's out there earn,
earn his.

1884
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,540
Keep getting any welfare in the form of

1885
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,950
giving him shit.
I don't know how big the bobcat's get.

1886
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,420
They get like 30 or 40 pounds.
Right?

1887
01:29:06,421 --> 01:29:07,470
They're pretty big.
Yeah.

1888
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:11,190
But I would imagine arco yacht out this 
bigger,

1889
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:14,670
somewhere around there.
I bet coyotes don't fuck with bobcat's.

1890
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:15,840
Probably not.
Yeah,

1891
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:20,870
but it's too much work.
I mean they probably could kill them if 

1892
01:29:20,870 --> 01:29:21,360
they got a bunch of them together,
but it probably tastes like shit.

1893
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:23,350
It's probably like chew in a shoe.
Yeah,

1894
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:27,480
exactly.
There's no self than this.

1895
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,150
And you know what apparently taste good 
is mountain lion.

1896
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:31,260
Really?
Yeah.

1897
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:33,780
I know this guy in Colorado and 
Colorado,

1898
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:38,781
they're pretty.
They're good about taking care of them 

1899
01:29:38,781 --> 01:29:42,411
too.
They have mountain lions seasons and 

1900
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:42,411
they try to keep the populations down 
and you know,

1901
01:29:42,411 --> 01:29:46,971
some people will argue saying that 
they're killing too many and this and 

1902
01:29:46,971 --> 01:29:46,971
that.
You shouldn't kill them,

1903
01:29:46,971 --> 01:29:50,370
but there needs to be some sort of a 
balance.

1904
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:55,460
Otherwise they start appearing on 
people's lawns and killing peoples out 

1905
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:59,311
and like California has a real problem 
because they don't allow people to hunt 

1906
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,400
them and they have a lot of.
Coyotes are a lot of mountain lions and 

1907
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,930
that's one of the reasons where the deer
population in California,

1908
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:08,931
so low it up of course,
and some people like it that way and 

1909
01:30:08,931 --> 01:30:08,931
they think,
well that's the natural balance,

1910
01:30:08,931 --> 01:30:09,600
really shouldn't have that many deer 
round.

1911
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,840
And ultimately,
I mean I can see that point where it's 

1912
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:18,321
probably better to have a lot of 
mountain line than it is a lot of lyme 

1913
01:30:18,321 --> 01:30:21,150
disease ticks and a lot of deers 
slamming into cars like you do in places

1914
01:30:21,151 --> 01:30:23,160
that don't have high mountain lion 
populations,

1915
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:28,390
you know,
like Michigan or something like that 

1916
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:29,841
where they have a lot of them.
But I'm focused on my point that we 

1917
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:31,630
should eat with lion.

1918
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,890
Oh,
they taste good though.

1919
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,400
These guys that I know that hunting in 
Colorado and I said,

1920
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:36,330
really?
I'm like,

1921
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:37,650
what does it taste like?
And he goes,

1922
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:39,750
it's a lot like pork,
pork loin.

1923
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,130
Yeah.
Did you take the backstrap from um,

1924
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:44,000
outline and uh,
you know,

1925
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:45,480
the,
the roast,

1926
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:50,481
it was weird because my solar ray,
that tourists are not excited with you 

1927
01:30:50,481 --> 01:30:53,190
think of what do you want to eat?
But apparently taste really good.

1928
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:58,280
They said it tastes really good.
Like this one guy that was talking to 

1929
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:58,620
one of his favorite meats said it tastes
just like a pork roast.

1930
01:30:58,830 --> 01:31:00,630
They make it with like a blueberry 
sauce.

1931
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I'm a nature school today.
I found out that she had rafts or cons 

1932
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,180
that birds,
that of goodness.

1933
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:14,810
There's all sorts of things to be 
learned here about the wild,

1934
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:16,540
natural world,
you know,

1935
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:18,750
it's just,
it's like I said,

1936
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:23,810
there's something about the predators 
that I find just unbelievably 

1937
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:25,380
fascinating and I think it's because 
they have to,

1938
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:30,710
they have to be so explosive and so 
quick and so dangerous in order to get 

1939
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:33,270
what they're,
they want to get.

1940
01:31:33,271 --> 01:31:37,350
They can't just walk around and chew on 
grass and like cows.

1941
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:39,990
Nobody gets excited when they see a cow 
because it's just,

1942
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:43,770
even if it wasn't so common,
they're fucking boring.

1943
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,950
Like Buffalo,
they're the same.

1944
01:31:46,980 --> 01:31:49,890
But at least they have cool hair 
executive.

1945
01:31:50,430 --> 01:31:53,910
They make some sounds that are.
Yeah,

1946
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,790
battlestar.
Cool.

1947
01:31:54,820 --> 01:31:59,820
I ended up once in the middle of a herd 
of Buffalo in custer state park in South

1948
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:00,550
Dakota

1949
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,160
where I took like,
um,

1950
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:02,890
they have,
you know,

1951
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:07,920
the regular roads that you can take with
the card and they have some dirt roads 

1952
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,430
that you can still take with the car.
So I was kind of off the beaten path and

1953
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:13,240
all of a sudden I find myself in the 
middle of like probably 300 buffaloes,

1954
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:17,710
so I kind of stopped the car away there 
and they are going everywhere around me.

1955
01:32:17,711 --> 01:32:19,510
Right.
There's like one site to the card,

1956
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:24,160
the other in front of me behind me.
And they are big powerful animals,

1957
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:25,000
you know,
you see them,

1958
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:30,001
you're either a,
not to piss them off because they are 

1959
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:30,001
solid,
you know,

1960
01:32:30,001 --> 01:32:30,440
they don't mess around.
And he was awesome though.

1961
01:32:30,441 --> 01:32:31,440
I mean,
once I figured,

1962
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:33,100
okay,
these guys don't want to fuck with me,

1963
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:35,260
they just want to move around me and 
they don't care.

1964
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:39,280
He was great because you see the cafs 
running after they are beautiful.

1965
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:41,500
They are really also my animals and 
yeah,

1966
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:47,250
that's the thing with all wild species.
Salar cooler than all the domesticated 

1967
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:53,311
species tend to be dumb Bert and to be a
lot like somebody is going to be food 

1968
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:56,100
anyway while you die,
you know you need to be on.

1969
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:58,230
He's like,
when you see a dog and you see a coyote,

1970
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,390
they are silent.
You don't hear them make a damn noise.

1971
01:33:01,391 --> 01:33:02,380
You see them and you're like,
oh,

1972
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,270
is that a dog?
And you know,

1973
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:08,610
30 seconds.
Even though he's not a dog because they 

1974
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:08,610
had moved away,
they,

1975
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:09,070
it's a whole different game.
Was good.

1976
01:33:09,071 --> 01:33:10,770
Dogs are all done.
Been happier there.

1977
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:14,080
Like who?
Who will be your the way noisier.

1978
01:33:14,081 --> 01:33:15,980
It's a sneaky.
Yeah.

1979
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,750
The wilder version is always so you 
know,

1980
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,310
you don't cut it if you're.
If you're not smart in the world,

1981
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:22,840
it's hard to live.

1982
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,970
It's a hard life and they have this like
this,

1983
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:30,510
this air about them.
They're just trying to catch something 

1984
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:34,570
to sneaking around.
The first time I saw a coyote was in 

1985
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:36,550
burbank in 1994 when I first moved here.
I was staying at the Oakwoods,

1986
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:41,640
the Oakwoods,
they have these pre furnished 

1987
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:43,771
apartments,
that's where I lived and I was driving 

1988
01:33:43,771 --> 01:33:46,711
to my place and I saw this dog in the 
road and another dog next to him and I 

1989
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:46,711
was like,
Oh shit,

1990
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:48,830
that's a wolf.
I realized like,

1991
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:50,240
oh,
that's great.

1992
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:55,740
That's a live thing that I'm realizing 
those are wild coyotes and they're just 

1993
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:56,040
wandering through Burbank,
like Oh,

1994
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,430
strange that they can just exist on the 
streets.

1995
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:05,800
I didn't know that.
I figured if you lived in the rural 

1996
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,521
areas you would encounter them,
but I didn't realize that they had 

1997
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:08,521
actually gone deep,
deep,

1998
01:34:08,521 --> 01:34:10,300
deep into the cities in search of like 
cats and shit.

1999
01:34:10,630 --> 01:34:14,200
Big Time I ever.
I found one in my age in my yard and not

2000
01:34:14,201 --> 01:34:16,480
so long ago and he was getting a bit too
comfortable.

2001
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:19,200
It was just kind of roaming around 
around him as like first year like,

2002
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:20,080
oh,
this is so cool.

2003
01:34:20,081 --> 01:34:21,850
I can't believe I'm seeing these.
After awhile you're like,

2004
01:34:21,851 --> 01:34:26,851
okay,
to never get too comfortable in my 

2005
01:34:26,851 --> 01:34:27,690
backyard because you have a kid and I 
walked out.

2006
01:34:27,770 --> 01:34:30,670
Then the coyotes are moving away and 
then I realized,

2007
01:34:30,671 --> 01:34:35,671
what the Hell am I doing?
I'm putting a wild animal with his back 

2008
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:35,671
against the fence.
That can be a good idea,

2009
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:38,770
but that was my sweet delusional because
my idea of the fence,

2010
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,360
like I took a look at me and was like,
you call these offense.

2011
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,520
It was like probably a good six foot 
fence and he just jumped it in one thing

2012
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:49,240
without even just said these will keep 
out at dog.

2013
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,760
Those stupid things he will make keep 
around but me,

2014
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,980
I got something God's going on.
And I was like,

2015
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:55,510
okay,
wild animal.

2016
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:58,000
Our whole different game.
Yeah.

2017
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:03,470
Yeah.
I had a coyote killed one of my 

2018
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:03,470
chickens,
hot my friends,

2019
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:03,470
like it was nothing.
Really.

2020
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:07,241
Yeah.
I watched him hop the fence with the 

2021
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:07,241
chicken in his mouth.
I was like,

2022
01:35:07,241 --> 01:35:08,180
wow.
That was their powerful motherfucker.

2023
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,250
Well,
when chickens brewed,

2024
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:15,640
um,
you have to remove them from their 

2025
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:17,870
regular nest because they'll sit in the 
nesting box that pull their feathers off

2026
01:35:17,871 --> 01:35:20,960
and they get sick and they can do it for
like a month and a half at a time.

2027
01:35:20,961 --> 01:35:25,961
So what you gotta do is you got to put 
them in a small cage for a couple of 

2028
01:35:25,961 --> 01:35:29,051
days where they have to stand on a rail,
they have to clutch and sit on this rail

2029
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:34,630
and you do that for a couple of days and
then they'll get over the brooding 

2030
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,180
instincts and get normal again.
It's just this cycle because they're not

2031
01:35:35,181 --> 01:35:36,160
having sex.
Oh,

2032
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:37,010
is that what it is?

2033
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:39,890
Because they're not having sex.
Like when you eat an egg.

2034
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,160
I didn't know this until really late in 
life,

2035
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:46,610
but an egg at the ready for a new piece 
of information or let it go.

2036
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:49,700
I thought an egg would become a chicken.
That's how retarded I am.

2037
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:54,701
I thought the only way that it chicken 
makes an egg as if she gets fucked by a 

2038
01:35:54,701 --> 01:35:58,511
rooster and then an egg comes out and 
then they sit on the a and it becomes a 

2039
01:35:58,511 --> 01:36:01,040
chicken and you just got to get the egg 
before the chicken hatches.

2040
01:36:01,041 --> 01:36:02,600
Then you create.
That's not the case.

2041
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:05,180
That's my understanding of faith.
So please enlighten me.

2042
01:36:05,181 --> 01:36:10,181
Now they actually lay eggs all the time 
with no males involved whatsoever.

2043
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:16,600
So I have 22 chickens,
I have no males or all females and they 

2044
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,221
lay usually,
if not an egg a day at the very least an

2045
01:36:21,261 --> 01:36:22,400
egg every other day close.

2046
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:26,120
And those eggs will never be chickens.
Never.

2047
01:36:26,150 --> 01:36:28,850
So people that are vegetarians that 
don't eat eggs,

2048
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,600
like you're really silly because it's 
animal protein that doesn't hurt 

2049
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:35,300
anybody.
These chickens,

2050
01:36:35,301 --> 01:36:36,890
they lay these eggs whether you like it 
or not.

2051
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,500
And if you don't eat them,
they just rot,

2052
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,410
right?
You could just,

2053
01:36:39,620 --> 01:36:41,480
you know,
but um,

2054
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,800
these,
uh,

2055
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:48,100
these chickens,
they would take them when they're 

2056
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:49,580
brooding and then I'd put them in this 
other box and the other boxes outside of

2057
01:36:49,581 --> 01:36:52,460
their coop and it was,
you know,

2058
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:57,461
fairly secure.
But this coyote had figured out how to 

2059
01:36:57,461 --> 01:37:00,671
tip it over and uh,
got the chicken and he had them in his 

2060
01:37:00,671 --> 01:37:04,361
mouth and I watched him hold it in his 
mouth and run through my yard with his 

2061
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:04,361
mouth.
I'm like,

2062
01:37:04,361 --> 01:37:08,531
this motherfucker.
And I opened the door thinking like 

2063
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:11,321
maybe I would be able to get to him 
before he could jump the fence with the 

2064
01:37:11,321 --> 01:37:11,321
chicken.

2065
01:37:11,321 --> 01:37:11,350
Nope,
not even close.

2066
01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:13,700
Just leaped over it like it was nothing 
that.

2067
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:18,920
Exactly what their ability is amazing.
And a mountain lion a way crazier.

2068
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:22,370
They can just do ridiculous shit.
They can jump like 12 foot fences.

2069
01:37:22,490 --> 01:37:25,820
That would freak me out in the wild.
The mountain lion in the fight.

2070
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:29,180
If you don't have any weapons on you,
we are not a good thing.

2071
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:31,280
Yeah.
That's scary.

2072
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:32,630
Shit.
I ain't scared of Shit.

2073
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:37,720
There's a video of this guy hiking and 
he's hiking and as he's hiking this 

2074
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:37,720
mountain,
I just sitting there staring at him,

2075
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:42,221
watching him and he's on this trail and 
he starts making noise and smack and 

2076
01:37:42,221 --> 01:37:46,091
sticks against the ground.
But it's like that guy probably came 

2077
01:37:46,091 --> 01:37:46,940
super close to getting eaten up and if 
it was smaller,

2078
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,160
especially if it was like a small woman.
Yep.

2079
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:55,480
Yeah.
That was a case of not it a few years 

2080
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:56,190
ago and Griffith Park and there was some
lady got eaten

2081
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:01,170
by a mountain lion while hiking.
I'm not surprised they're out there.

2082
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:03,630
There's a lot of them there,
you know,

2083
01:38:03,631 --> 01:38:05,310
they,
they track quite a few of them,

2084
01:38:05,311 --> 01:38:10,311
but I guess when it comes to large,
big predators is probably one of the 

2085
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:13,470
best ones to have around because you 
know,

2086
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,060
they,
they have plenty shit.

2087
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,600
They eat right.
They,

2088
01:38:16,601 --> 01:38:18,780
they keep away from people for the most 
part.

2089
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:22,260
But it is weird that we,
not only do we want to help them,

2090
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:24,300
like they're,
they're setting up these,

2091
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:30,260
they're like bridges that go across the 
highway because one of the ways that 

2092
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,561
Mount Lines di is trying to cross the 
highway to tried to cross the 101 and 

2093
01:38:33,561 --> 01:38:33,561
they get nailed.
Yup.

2094
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:36,240
I say fuck them.
She's stupid.

2095
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,670
So stupid.
Let her know to cross traffic.

2096
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:43,760
I'm fucking stupid.
He run into traffic.

2097
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:49,450
It's not a cat that needs to be around 
that.

2098
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:51,360
That's nature's way.
A thin the herd.

2099
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,970
I mean selection.
Just a lot of them,

2100
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:59,080
you know,
we don't really need to protect them 

2101
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,471
that much.
They need to spend millions of dollars 

2102
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:00,471
building a bridge,
you know?

2103
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:00,471
How about cleanup,
skid row,

2104
01:39:00,471 --> 01:39:01,620
that will work on those animals.
There

2105
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,390
I was,
um,

2106
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:05,810
I like to go to big bear because,
you know,

2107
01:39:05,811 --> 01:39:07,700
he's only four hours away from me or 
something,

2108
01:39:07,701 --> 01:39:09,070
but he's awesome.
It's like a whole lot.

2109
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:11,050
Their environment is beautiful,
the trees,

2110
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:16,210
everything.
So I like to go out there and the place 

2111
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:18,851
where I usually go the,
I was chatting with some neighbors and 

2112
01:39:18,851 --> 01:39:18,851
they were telling me,
yeah,

2113
01:39:18,851 --> 01:39:22,821
you know,
these days bears have stopped coming 

2114
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:22,821
around.
I'm like,

2115
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:22,821
why?
What's,

2116
01:39:22,821 --> 01:39:27,510
what's up is that coke was a mountain 
lion moved into the neighborhood and 

2117
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:27,910
even they are freaked out by him to get 
into the.

2118
01:39:27,930 --> 01:39:32,930
There are like,
I mean the Bayers in big bear or not 

2119
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:32,930
this huge black blackberry.
Exactly.

2120
01:39:32,930 --> 01:39:37,450
And appeared to this mountain lion is 
extra grass even decided the bears 

2121
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:38,390
decided let's move to a nicer 
neighborhood.

2122
01:39:38,530 --> 01:39:40,640
Oh,
so one gangster mountain moved down.

2123
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:41,270
Exactly.

2124
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,210
And there's a hiking around and he was 
probably 6:00

2125
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:50,210
PM and I'm like,
do I really want to do this at this 

2126
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:50,370
time?
This does not seem like the best plan in

2127
01:39:50,371 --> 01:39:53,040
the order.
I know a no way.

2128
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:55,260
Phones like this too much.

2129
01:39:55,390 --> 01:40:00,390
Yeah.
You got to go with like fucking four 

2130
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,260
hockey outfit on maybe football series 
ads and some chain mail.

2131
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:05,770
They're not going to get you though.
They have things to eat.

2132
01:40:05,771 --> 01:40:08,020
There are plenty of things to eat.
Most of the time,

2133
01:40:08,021 --> 01:40:09,520
mountain lions don't want to have 
anything to do with.

2134
01:40:09,521 --> 01:40:14,521
People are sick old ones that they need 
food so bad until they're willing to 

2135
01:40:14,771 --> 01:40:17,620
take a chance on a person of course,
but for the most part,

2136
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:22,600
even if you do like the natural 
selection process is probably eliminated

2137
01:40:22,601 --> 01:40:25,660
people from their diet because every 
mountain lion that chose to eat a person

2138
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:27,040
was killed.
Exactly.

2139
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:30,680
So they somehow or another,
they all,

2140
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:31,690
yeah,
they know,

2141
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:33,100
fuck,
we're bipedal,

2142
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:35,440
but they think they can get away with 
it.

2143
01:40:35,860 --> 01:40:40,860
Why not?
But the is beautiful as they are.

2144
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:42,730
They are.
They,

2145
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:44,920
they're terrifying and they're ferocious
and everything,

2146
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:50,340
but it would be way more thrilled to see
one of those than I would to see 

2147
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,320
something that doesn't kill things and 
then it's weird.

2148
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:53,650
Right?
Yeah,

2149
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:54,100
and I think

2150
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,920
it goes back to the same thing we were 
talking about regarding history.

2151
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:59,140
Why is it that we're fascinated with 
that and we are,

2152
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:04,170
you know,
there's no denying it and you'd be 

2153
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:04,170
bullshit to pretend no,
you know,

2154
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:07,621
I like peace and mellow and I like to 
see people shake hands and it's like 

2155
01:41:07,621 --> 01:41:10,120
there's a beauty to some mellow,
peaceful stuff,

2156
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:12,010
but we dig.
We like you at.

2157
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:14,680
Why do we like fight it?
Why do we what it is,

2158
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,540
right?
It's a,

2159
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,800
that's the game.
It's in nature.

2160
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:19,230
We like it.
We like it.

2161
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,240
Them on half of it is about the conflict
and the wars and it's all about that 

2162
01:41:24,881 --> 01:41:28,450
stuff and it's conflict and 
consequences.

2163
01:41:28,451 --> 01:41:31,170
Like if you were in the ocean and you 
saw a,

2164
01:41:31,340 --> 01:41:33,730
a big Marlin,
like wow,

2165
01:41:33,731 --> 01:41:35,590
that'd be cool.
I'll look at that Marlin.

2166
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:37,680
But if you saw a shark,
eat tomorrowland.

2167
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,340
Yeah.
It'd be way more exciting.

2168
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:44,580
You know,
if you see if whale whales are cool to 

2169
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:46,891
see their beautiful arc,
but killer whale is way cooler than a 

2170
01:41:46,891 --> 01:41:48,520
regular way.
There's that.

2171
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:53,530
Something's gonna something exciting and
dramatic is going on shark sharks way 

2172
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,500
cooler than a regular fish.
Yeah.

2173
01:41:56,501 --> 01:41:58,810
There's something about those type of 
animals.

2174
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:02,570
Like I would love to go on to Africa and
the safari.

2175
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:07,590
If it wasn't for malaria and Ebola 
wasn't for those 57 threesomes would 

2176
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,620
fucking parasites and all kinds of crazy
shit.

2177
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:16,950
I would love to go to Africa just to,
in the off chance of seeing a alliance 

2178
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:20,140
take something down on a safari.
I would love to go and see that.

2179
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:25,200
I'd love to love to witness that.
I wonder how often that that takes 

2180
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:28,591
place.
Like when you go on one of those 

2181
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:28,591
safaris,
when,

2182
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:28,591
how often you actually see something get
jacked.

2183
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:33,600
Yeah.
Even because just because they are 

2184
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:35,401
hunting doesn't mean they're going to be
successful because course a bunch of 

2185
01:42:35,401 --> 01:42:38,161
times you fail and that's the.
And I think that's part of the 

2186
01:42:38,161 --> 01:42:40,981
interesting conflict is there's 
something's going to happen and the two 

2187
01:42:40,981 --> 01:42:45,361
sides,
whoever the two sites are trying 

2188
01:42:45,361 --> 01:42:48,150
opposite seeing.
So there's this conflict of wheel in 

2189
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:48,490
somebodies going to get their way and 
somebody isn't.

2190
01:42:48,590 --> 01:42:53,590
So there's that element of excitement 
that almost make you want a bath or 

2191
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:53,680
anything like what's going on?
Who's gonna,

2192
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:57,540
who's gonna step up and lead their a 
game and succeed and full.

2193
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:59,170
Was that miserably?
It's a.

2194
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:01,600
it's cool when you watch fights,
it's cool.

2195
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:02,440
What do you watch?
Anything.

2196
01:43:02,441 --> 01:43:04,230
It's like there's even.
We should not fight.

2197
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:08,200
He was the lie on chasing the Gazelle is
like Ken the gazelle speed.

2198
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,010
Leave the light on in the dust and the 
just leaving pissed off and hungry.

2199
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:13,810
Or is it going?
There's that question.

2200
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:18,811
There is like,
let's see how they played their cards 

2201
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:18,811
when life is on the line,
you know?

2202
01:43:18,811 --> 01:43:22,860
Yeah.
And that contemplation of how the 

2203
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:25,411
outcome's going to go down.
Like what was that for whatever reason 

2204
01:43:25,411 --> 01:43:27,160
is one of the most compelling things 
that people can watch.

2205
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:32,280
Yep.
It's where were so strange in that 

2206
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:32,280
regard that,
that,

2207
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:35,710
that is like one of the most interesting
things for people.

2208
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:37,900
I mean,
that's why the Romans,

2209
01:43:38,210 --> 01:43:41,860
I mean when they were feeding the lions 
are Christians.

2210
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,020
Right?
That's what that was all bound.

2211
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,570
It's like to see how long that guy can 
last in there.

2212
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:51,660
Just to check these out.
These a nasty story that I did not know 

2213
01:43:51,681 --> 01:43:52,310
about.

2214
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,920
So what happened was after they would 
have the beast,

2215
01:43:57,921 --> 01:44:01,730
either fight each other or they'll have 
the lie on seat Kriesti answer something

2216
01:44:01,731 --> 01:44:06,731
than a typical thing is that after the 
end of the day when a whole bunch of 

2217
01:44:06,731 --> 01:44:07,430
these animals have been killed in one 
fight or another,

2218
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:12,230
the Roman emperors to kind of look cool 
and popular with the crowds,

2219
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:15,590
would then distribute the meat to all 
the poor people of Rome.

2220
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:20,710
So the animals killed India in our then 
be eaten by all the poorest people in 

2221
01:44:20,710 --> 01:44:25,220
Rome as a Freebie because you're a poor 
person and you're more likely than not a

2222
01:44:25,221 --> 01:44:27,410
lot of people in your realm or pretty 
close to starving.

2223
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:30,320
A lot of the times nothing.
Get them be thrown away.

2224
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:33,050
You eat right,
you eat the whole animal.

2225
01:44:33,051 --> 01:44:34,700
Whatever they give you,
you eat it.

2226
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:40,570
So what does that mean?
That means that among other things that 

2227
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:43,430
would end up as we are an exalted in on 
the table.

2228
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:48,850
Sometime you get also the interiors of 
animals that have just been eating 

2229
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:52,010
people.
So through via second hand,

2230
01:44:52,011 --> 01:44:57,011
you're also eating people since you're 
eating stoma contents of a lie on the 

2231
01:44:57,011 --> 01:45:01,631
job and got killed in the arena and that
lie and just finished feeding on a 

2232
01:45:01,631 --> 01:45:04,800
Christiano.
So you're having a Lion Christiane 

2233
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,440
Burger for yourself.
This is just something you just found 

2234
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,100
out about three,
four years ago I was doing some research

2235
01:45:10,101 --> 01:45:12,890
on gladiators and games and all of that 
that I was like.

2236
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:14,460
And I started picking that savings,

2237
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:16,150
a bunch of sources.
I'm like,

2238
01:45:16,151 --> 01:45:17,350
okay,
so this is not bullshit.

2239
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:22,380
This is uh,
so is that something they discussed in 

2240
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:24,670
the history texts,
like they discussed that people would 

2241
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:24,670
talk about accidentally eating.
People are like,

2242
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:25,660
how would they say?
Yeah.

2243
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:26,950
Essentially they were like,
hey,

2244
01:45:26,951 --> 01:45:30,250
people ate the whole thing.
There was no,

2245
01:45:30,251 --> 01:45:32,470
nothing was thrown away.
The whole thing was.

2246
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:36,660
And I guess I don't know if there were 
primary sources that refer to these that

2247
01:45:36,661 --> 01:45:38,410
were,
that I forget the exact,

2248
01:45:38,411 --> 01:45:39,790
you know,
the smoking guns that say,

2249
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:41,020
yeah,
this is what happened.

2250
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:44,470
But I remember seeing it in an AF 
secondary sources to say,

2251
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,120
okay,
there's something to that story.

2252
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,620
I didn't know there was any history at 
all.

2253
01:45:47,621 --> 01:45:49,570
If people eating lions.
Yeah,

2254
01:45:49,571 --> 01:45:54,571
I mean you wouldn't as a choice,
but if you are a starving plebe and 

2255
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:57,700
enroll was nothing else,
and the emperor say,

2256
01:45:57,730 --> 01:45:59,200
look,
what a nice guy I am.

2257
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:03,400
I'm giving you lie on star Mark,
please have fun car.

2258
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:08,970
It's that is the civilization that we 
always point to when we talk about 

2259
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:13,630
excess leading to chaos leading to the 
client of civilization.

2260
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:18,900
We always talk about Rome,
but either the United States way more 

2261
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,130
fucked up and decadent than Rome ever 
was.

2262
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:23,530
Except for feeding Christians to the 
lions.

2263
01:46:23,531 --> 01:46:25,240
Yeah.
Other than that,

2264
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:28,750
if you look at the overall numbers of 
death,

2265
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:34,050
there's a lot of shit that we've done to
the environment should do.

2266
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:39,060
We've done.
I mean that just the sheer number of 

2267
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:39,640
human beings.
You're dealing with 350.

2268
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,680
Was it somewhere?
Three $50 million.

2269
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:44,080
It's a lot.
It's just,

2270
01:46:44,081 --> 01:46:49,081
it's crazy that they got to the point 
where they were entertaining themselves 

2271
01:46:49,081 --> 01:46:49,980
by bringing

2272
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,270
in gigantic predators.
Like how far is Rome from Africa?

2273
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,990
How the fuck did they get lions?
Yeah.

2274
01:46:56,020 --> 01:47:01,020
Day will dive a hand thirst trap and 
then Dan them I guess a set up a bait on

2275
01:47:03,391 --> 01:47:05,360
something they would like.
They would fall in,

2276
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:10,560
in um,
in a big pete where they can climb it 

2277
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:13,440
every way out.
And then I don't know exactly how they 

2278
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:13,440
get a cage on them and their rapid.
It's,

2279
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:16,260
I'm sure a lot of people died to 
provide,

2280
01:47:16,270 --> 01:47:21,270
uh,
the lions for Rome and then you ship 

2281
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,860
them by boat through cc Dan they send up
to Rome and uh,

2282
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:28,300
they did to a level that they see that 
the animal population of North Africa 

2283
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:33,531
changed completely because of the Roman 
games because they were killing 

2284
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:35,400
thousands upon thousands of them that 
they literally,

2285
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:38,340
they drove some species extinct in north
Africa,

2286
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:39,270
at least in that part.

2287
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:40,980
You know what the fuck?
Yeah.

2288
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:45,981
That's such a massive scale they want to
do for the Games.

2289
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:49,890
And the Roman,
the guys were setting up to the games.

2290
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:53,310
They were kind of like,
remember when pride was on and there was

2291
01:47:53,311 --> 01:47:55,460
those wacky Japanese matchmake he'd 
wanted.

2292
01:47:55,480 --> 01:47:57,960
They would have like,
let's throw the 600 pound,

2293
01:47:57,980 --> 01:47:59,650
the Huda case,
the hundred 50 power.

2294
01:47:59,651 --> 01:48:04,651
Let's see.
What happens though is that Robin's 

2295
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:04,651
matchmakers or like Japanese 
matchmakers,

2296
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:05,400
they had those ideas.
It's like,

2297
01:48:05,401 --> 01:48:08,370
I wonder what happens if we throw at the
bar.

2298
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:10,640
Let's see what you know.
Let's try it.

2299
01:48:10,650 --> 01:48:15,650
We'll do that stuff.
Was there a conversation like that 

2300
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:16,740
before them or did they invent these 
games?

2301
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:21,970
Put all bleed.
The gladiatorial stuff was ancient in 

2302
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:24,810
Greece and some people think about the 
Etruscans as well.

2303
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:29,811
There may have been some orange in there
because the story about the gladiators 

2304
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:32,991
is that I started out as human sacrifice
that they would do it rather than he 

2305
01:48:32,991 --> 01:48:32,991
originally.

2306
01:48:32,991 --> 01:48:37,820
They probably sacrifice somebody on the 
grave of some important person because 

2307
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:39,060
the idea was that there was feeding the 
spirit of the dead.

2308
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:41,370
Then probably somebody said,
hey,

2309
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,970
how about instead of sacrificing me,
I give you entertainment,

2310
01:48:43,971 --> 01:48:47,280
so we have a nice big fight.
I got the other prisoner of war.

2311
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,130
We go at it.
One of us died.

2312
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:51,060
Doesn't have to be me.
I have at least a shot,

2313
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:56,420
one of us,
the blood will feed the data and the 

2314
01:48:56,420 --> 01:48:56,520
other one got to walk over live.
We decided bay.

2315
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:58,650
Cool.
It's like we got entertainment on top of

2316
01:48:58,651 --> 01:49:00,590
the sacrifice.
That's one of the popular theories.

2317
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,020
You think it was the prisoners idea or 
do you think it was like some.

2318
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:07,680
I would think they would more likely be 
some sadistic rulers idea.

2319
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,790
I mean if you will.
Yeah,

2320
01:49:09,870 --> 01:49:14,130
there's that one sword into the cage.

2321
01:49:14,670 --> 01:49:16,020
That could be.
But at the same time,

2322
01:49:16,021 --> 01:49:17,880
if I'm the.
What about be sacrifice and be like,

2323
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:23,090
Hey,
I'm going to make it fun for you guys 

2324
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,090
just.
But he'd be somebody else.

2325
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:24,840
And uh,
but yeah,

2326
01:49:24,841 --> 01:49:29,841
erk is,
it started out probably is a religious 

2327
01:49:29,841 --> 01:49:29,841
thing and then it evolved into,
oh,

2328
01:49:29,841 --> 01:49:31,020
this is fun.
It's corroded religion.

2329
01:49:31,021 --> 01:49:32,910
But just that sort of a good time.
Um,

2330
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:38,240
well we always point to the decadence of
the Roman Empire as being like the 

2331
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:38,940
pinnacle of their excess.
Right?

2332
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:44,900
That's how we look at it.
But then you go to Disneyland and you 

2333
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,990
see people on scooters everywhere you go
within themselves.

2334
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,460
These gelatinous beanbag

2335
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,340
style human beings.
I was just a Disneyland.

2336
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:51,790
I've,
I've.

2337
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:57,180
Every time I go there are more scholars.
There's more and more people just 

2338
01:49:57,311 --> 01:49:59,460
getting so big that they can't

2339
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,310
walk.
Yeah.

2340
01:50:00,311 --> 01:50:05,311
That's make it easier for people weed 
themselves to that because that's what 

2341
01:50:05,311 --> 01:50:08,731
we want.
It's had dairy are one of the reasons 

2342
01:50:08,731 --> 01:50:10,080
why I think he's seen thirsting for many
people in the US to study at all.

2343
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:15,090
When there's this fascination for Rome.
He's because of the parallels are not 

2344
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:15,090
that hard to see.
You know,

2345
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:19,950
you see that super powerful civilization
that keeps growing and growing and power

2346
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:24,190
and eventually hit the TPN scale off.
Access gets more and more.

2347
01:50:24,191 --> 01:50:29,191
People get healthier life,
so they do get softer and then you are 

2348
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:32,520
getting ready for her to fall in the 
face of somebody else.

2349
01:50:32,570 --> 01:50:35,310
Tougher and stronger will come from a 
harsher life was gonna.

2350
01:50:35,550 --> 01:50:37,330
You know,
it's the same stuff as the Roman empire,

2351
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:39,310
right?
Eventually,

2352
01:50:39,311 --> 01:50:44,311
stop sending your guys to fight your 
wars because I don't want my kids to go 

2353
01:50:44,311 --> 01:50:46,030
to are about.
That's what we did.

2354
01:50:46,031 --> 01:50:48,990
It's our heritage,
but I don't want to do that anymore.

2355
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,760
Let's hire some poor motherfucker to 
fight for us.

2356
01:50:52,210 --> 01:50:57,210
In the process,
your civilization gets weak until 

2357
01:50:57,210 --> 01:50:58,480
eventually the other motherfucker hiding
doesn't want to fight for you anymore.

2358
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:01,330
They turn on you and your civilization 
folds.

2359
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,550
Never learn.
No.

2360
01:51:04,570 --> 01:51:09,130
It's a tough balance between leaving too
harshly where,

2361
01:51:09,131 --> 01:51:10,690
yeah,
you'll become this war machine,

2362
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:14,920
but that's a sucky life and leaving to 
softly when it's.

2363
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,100
It's a real delicate game and I mean,
you know,

2364
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:20,680
it is with your kids.
You want sinks,

2365
01:51:20,681 --> 01:51:23,650
easy for them.
You want to make every single as easy as

2366
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:26,170
pleasant as possible,
but if you make it too easy,

2367
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,710
you throw them into wimps and suites.
If you make it too hard,

2368
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:31,120
they'll hate your guts because it's 
like,

2369
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:33,460
fuck you.
You're needlessly making my life hard.

2370
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:37,450
So it's like that very delicate game of 
making field.

2371
01:51:37,451 --> 01:51:41,140
People love the,
giving them support Dev when needed,

2372
01:51:41,141 --> 01:51:46,141
but then also teaching them how to be 
strong and does not happen through 

2373
01:51:46,141 --> 01:51:50,731
softness.
It doesn't happen through making 

2374
01:51:50,731 --> 01:51:50,731
everything easy for them.

2375
01:51:50,731 --> 01:51:54,190
I've had that conversation many times at
Brian Cowen where he and I were talking 

2376
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:54,190
about,
you know,

2377
01:51:54,190 --> 01:51:55,310
one of the reasons why,
um,

2378
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:58,310
you know,
Brian lived very strange life,

2379
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:00,680
like he went to boarding school for a 
lot of the time.

2380
01:52:00,681 --> 01:52:05,240
He grew up all over the world.
He lived in many different countries and

2381
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,720
we just faced a lot of adversity because
he couldn't make friends.

2382
01:52:08,721 --> 01:52:13,721
He was constantly moving and because of 
that he's just really interesting guy 

2383
01:52:13,721 --> 01:52:16,280
and everyone that we know that's really 
interesting had some sort of a fucked up

2384
01:52:16,281 --> 01:52:21,281
life.
And yet we don't want our kids to have 

2385
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:24,260
fun.
You don't want your kid to be 

2386
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:28,871
interesting.
I guess maybe what's that Chinese 

2387
01:52:28,871 --> 01:52:29,180
proverb with the curse may you live in 
interesting.

2388
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:31,550
Exactly.
It's uh,

2389
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:33,020
yeah,
it's,

2390
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:33,440
I,
I,

2391
01:52:33,530 --> 01:52:38,530
I wonder if that's the only way to 
create someone or to engineer the life 

2392
01:52:38,781 --> 01:52:41,090
of a human being that's,
that's a,

2393
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:46,120
that has character.
Like there's got to be ways that you 

2394
01:52:46,120 --> 01:52:46,280
could teach through difficult

2395
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:49,440
tasks or through athletic endeavors.
Like,

2396
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:50,410
I mean,
I,

2397
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:55,450
my life was definitely fucked up up 
until the time where I was in high 

2398
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:57,050
school,
but all of my,

2399
01:52:57,230 --> 01:53:02,230
I think my real character development,
all of who I became like the harder 

2400
01:53:02,721 --> 01:53:04,790
parts was when I was in a really nice 
neighborhood.

2401
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:10,240
I lived in Newton,
which is like a really nice suburb of 

2402
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:10,310
Boston,
but it was,

2403
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:12,650
that was when I was doing martial arts.
That's what I was competing.

2404
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:17,950
So I like consciously or purposely did 
something really difficult because that 

2405
01:53:20,241 --> 01:53:22,190
was what I was interested in.
I wasn't thinking,

2406
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,680
oh,
this difficult thing will make me a real

2407
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:30,280
interesting man when I grow up and this 
will provide me with all this character 

2408
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:30,830
development.
That was like,

2409
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:35,980
that was what I really wanted to do.
For whatever reason I was compelled to 

2410
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:38,921
it.
And then the byproduct of that was 

2411
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:38,921
developed character.

2412
01:53:38,921 --> 01:53:42,730
Yeah,
develop the ability to push myself and 

2413
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:44,831
discipline.
But I did it without having to go 

2414
01:53:44,831 --> 01:53:44,840
through horrible neighborhoods.
Nobody.

2415
01:53:44,841 --> 01:53:47,030
I mean people will beat me up in the 
gym,

2416
01:53:47,031 --> 01:53:49,700
but nobody beat me up in the street.
Nobody robbed me.

2417
01:53:49,701 --> 01:53:54,701
I didn't get shot or stabbed.
But I developed character in a way 

2418
01:53:54,701 --> 01:53:57,500
that's similar to what someone would 
probably go through if they went through

2419
01:53:57,730 --> 01:54:02,730
some bad violent times and I think you 
nailed it right there because you're 

2420
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:06,491
bidding getting up 17 that's not.
You're going to get that because we're 

2421
01:54:06,491 --> 01:54:10,670
going to throw you in the street and 
you're going to fight every day against 

2422
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:10,670
some crazy.
Kate's with nice and you survive.

2423
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:11,240
You are going to be tough.
It's like,

2424
01:54:11,241 --> 01:54:14,140
well that's silly though,
but at the same time he's now let's have

2425
01:54:14,141 --> 01:54:16,880
you shall tear.
Then I think martial arts in that regard

2426
01:54:16,881 --> 01:54:17,420
is perfect.

2427
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:22,420
You know,
combat sports are good age because they 

2428
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:24,191
do teach you toughness,
but they're still within a relatively 

2429
01:54:24,191 --> 01:54:25,230
protected environment.
Nobody's gonna pull out the gun on you.

2430
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:26,630
Nobody's going to will,
you know,

2431
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:29,080
it's,
it's tough buddies,

2432
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:32,210
CBLI stuff.
It's not a battle.

2433
01:54:32,211 --> 01:54:34,310
People through the walls and pray for 
the best.

2434
01:54:34,311 --> 01:54:35,660
So it's a,
it's a nice medium.

2435
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:38,000
And I think the more we make our life 
easier,

2436
01:54:38,001 --> 01:54:42,530
which we want to,
we do need to engage in seeing that keep

2437
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,690
the business alive at least to some 
degree.

2438
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:50,240
You're not going to be tough the way the
one guy who survive out of 100 was being

2439
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:53,330
thrown to the wolves,
but at the same time you still have that

2440
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:55,940
muscle.
There is now completely gone because you

2441
01:54:55,941 --> 01:55:00,941
are just all about because then now you 
end up with people who are very 

2442
01:55:00,941 --> 01:55:00,941
pleasant,
very nice,

2443
01:55:00,941 --> 01:55:04,070
very sweet and complete Williams and 
don't have a spine and then it's like,

2444
01:55:04,730 --> 01:55:06,080
that's not the solution either.

2445
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:11,670
They have no resilience.
They don't have any experience in 

2446
01:55:11,670 --> 01:55:15,400
overcoming difficult situations.
I oftentimes think about that when I 

2447
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,230
think about animals because you know,
I have dogs,

2448
01:55:17,260 --> 01:55:21,110
I have cats and my animals have zero.
I mean,

2449
01:55:21,560 --> 01:55:23,030
I guess,
I mean they would,

2450
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:25,280
they would kill something if they could,
but they don't.

2451
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,640
They're not mean at all.
But if you see a wild animal or an 

2452
01:55:30,651 --> 01:55:35,651
animal that has to get its own food,
there is so different and the only way 

2453
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:39,560
you can get an animal that's team is you
have to provide them with all their food

2454
01:55:39,561 --> 01:55:44,040
and then you have to bypass all of their
natural predatory instincts

2455
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,250
that every dog has and every cat has.
And there's a way to bypass it.

2456
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:52,460
You just got to give them steady food 
and love steady food and loves food and 

2457
01:55:52,460 --> 01:55:56,601
love.
And in doing that you quote unquote 

2458
01:55:56,601 --> 01:55:56,601
domesticate them.
Right?

2459
01:55:56,601 --> 01:56:00,060
And that's kind of also what's happening
with people.

2460
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:05,450
You know,
what we're doing with human beings is 

2461
01:56:05,450 --> 01:56:07,300
turning people into these fluffy sort of
kitty cat type people.

2462
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:12,380
Exactly where if everything goes wrong 
and you find yourself on a deserted 

2463
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:12,480
island,
you can go feral,

2464
01:56:13,550 --> 01:56:18,550
try to figure out a way to survive or 
eaten raw mussels and chewing on routes 

2465
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:22,350
and stuff.
But the reality is what you've become is

2466
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:25,050
a domesticated person.
You know,

2467
01:56:25,051 --> 01:56:28,290
if you ever see like liquid,
they catch people,

2468
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:31,890
they find people that have been like 
living in the wild by themselves,

2469
01:56:31,891 --> 01:56:36,180
like it's only been a few times or are 
found like actual wild feral people.

2470
01:56:36,181 --> 01:56:39,990
But they represented,
they resemble feral animals.

2471
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:41,340
They don't.
And a lot of ways

2472
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,920
that's how you survive.
You know,

2473
01:56:42,921 --> 01:56:46,710
it's who does live in the wild and 
succeed while Dynamo.

2474
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,230
So human being was going to do with 
that.

2475
01:56:48,260 --> 01:56:49,930
This is going to be along those lines.
It's

2476
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:55,140
but what we value from people,
a lot of what we value is domesticated 

2477
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:58,831
people.
Like what I like is people that I go up 

2478
01:56:58,831 --> 01:57:01,291
to a hug them.
I know they're not going to try to bite 

2479
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:01,291
my neck

2480
01:57:01,291 --> 01:57:02,700
to avoid a leader that way as well.
Yes.

2481
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:07,730
I tend to enjoy the same thing.
Now it's like anything is a balance and 

2482
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:09,510
the balance is not 50 50,
maybe 90 slash 10,

2483
01:57:09,511 --> 01:57:14,511
but you still need to have a little of 
that other side is always that there's 

2484
01:57:14,511 --> 01:57:15,180
a.
Once you go a hundred zero,

2485
01:57:15,181 --> 01:57:16,770
Daniel really lost something.
You know?

2486
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:21,771
It's like where exactly is that 
balancing a desirable place where you 

2487
01:57:21,771 --> 01:57:25,941
are a strong person by our also pleasant
and sweet and nice and you can do all 

2488
01:57:25,941 --> 01:57:30,711
the things that we want in a civilized 
conversation without you being weak 

2489
01:57:30,931 --> 01:57:34,920
because that's the other aspect.
When people lack the staff side,

2490
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:40,460
then I don't buy their and cedar because
it's like you are nice because that's 

2491
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:42,390
the only thing you can be.
You don't even have the option not to be

2492
01:57:42,391 --> 01:57:47,391
nice because you don't know how.
You don't know what it takes to instead 

2493
01:57:47,391 --> 01:57:49,740
step up and be assertive and extra stuff
you don't have,

2494
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:54,950
so your niceness is not a choice.
You have your cab.

2495
01:57:55,761 --> 01:58:00,761
It shows their belly try is.
Whereas if somebody doesn't have to be 

2496
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,980
that way and chooses to be that way,
then I buy it directly.

2497
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:05,970
Then is legit because you're choosing 
that,

2498
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:06,730
right?

2499
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,800
If someone is generous because they want
to be generous because they have to be 

2500
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:11,800
generous.
Yeah.

2501
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:12,890
Yeah.
It's a strange,

2502
01:58:12,891 --> 01:58:14,900
fine line.
What why I was,

2503
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:19,960
why I've been focusing on this and 
obsessed with this lately is I've gotten

2504
01:58:21,021 --> 01:58:24,080
this weird idea in my head,
not necessarily weird,

2505
01:58:24,081 --> 01:58:29,081
but this inescapable thought about human
beings domesticating themselves with 

2506
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:35,291
supermarkets and that Sim supermarkets 
are in many ways a lot like serving a 

2507
01:58:35,691 --> 01:58:38,590
cat,
a bowl of cat food every day and that in

2508
01:58:38,660 --> 01:58:43,660
removing the equation of having to go 
and cut the wheat and pick the 

2509
01:58:43,660 --> 01:58:48,440
vegetables and kill the animals that you
eat and instead just show up the 

2510
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:52,170
supermarket by throwing the cart.
That what we've done is we've developed 

2511
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:55,650
a system of domestication and the 
supermarket or the fast food restaurant 

2512
01:58:55,781 --> 01:59:00,781
or whatever,
wherever you're getting your food and a 

2513
01:59:00,781 --> 01:59:03,031
lot of ways serves the same purpose that
a master does to a pet and that we were 

2514
01:59:03,581 --> 01:59:07,660
slowly domesticating the human animal in
that way.

2515
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:11,660
I think there's a lot of parallels there
and that's one of the reasons I'll also,

2516
01:59:11,661 --> 01:59:15,250
I think why people get angry.
Even people that eat meat when they find

2517
01:59:15,251 --> 01:59:16,410
out that people hunt.
Yeah.

2518
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:21,750
I think that they're reacting to this 
path that they're on and it's a path of 

2519
01:59:21,851 --> 01:59:24,100
domestication.
Even if it's a rational.

2520
01:59:24,101 --> 01:59:27,190
Even if they eat meat and I've had the 
most irrational,

2521
01:59:27,191 --> 01:59:30,610
which is people that are strict veggie 
vegetarians or vegans,

2522
01:59:30,611 --> 01:59:33,910
but they have animals.
They feed meat to say,

2523
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:35,960
yeah,
that doesn't know.

2524
01:59:35,970 --> 01:59:38,380
I know it's a lot of this stuff make no 
sense.

2525
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:42,910
It doesn't make sense,
but the rationalizations,

2526
01:59:42,911 --> 01:59:47,911
I feel like they form such a common 
pattern that you almost have to take 

2527
01:59:48,011 --> 01:59:53,011
into consideration the fact that those.
Those rationalizations may in fact be 

2528
01:59:53,011 --> 01:59:56,590
natural protective mechanisms for this 
domestication process to take place.

2529
01:59:56,640 --> 02:00:01,640
Yeah,
and I think that as we become more and 

2530
02:00:01,640 --> 02:00:02,170
more peaceful and more and more 
civilized,

2531
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:06,160
like I would say,
and I think everyone agrees that this is

2532
02:00:06,161 --> 02:00:09,460
probably the safest time for human 
beings to live ever.

2533
02:00:09,670 --> 02:00:10,630
Well,
you're a historian.

2534
02:00:10,631 --> 02:00:12,150
You know a lot about history.
Yeah.

2535
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:14,050
You would probably say that,
right?

2536
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:14,920
Yeah.
I mean,

2537
02:00:14,921 --> 02:00:16,870
when you look at so much of human 
history,

2538
02:00:16,871 --> 02:00:21,871
there's always the guys,
but I'm over to Hilo are going to come 

2539
02:00:21,871 --> 02:00:22,540
up and slow through your family at the 
drop of a dime.

2540
02:00:22,570 --> 02:00:27,420
So now the fact that most people in many
countries in the water,

2541
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:30,310
in that situation,
it's kind of unique.

2542
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,930
That's a.
it's awesome.

2543
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,540
It's not something that he.
Most of recorded history,

2544
02:00:34,541 --> 02:00:36,840
you can find evidence of.
You don't find any evidence that.

2545
02:00:36,841 --> 02:00:41,841
Right?
Like if you think about like a cruise 

2546
02:00:41,841 --> 02:00:42,130
ship pulling up to your harbor and a 
bunch of people get out,

2547
02:00:42,131 --> 02:00:46,360
you welcome them now strangers from a 
strange land and you're like,

2548
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,290
oh,
this is great.

2549
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:49,240
They're going to come over here and 
they're going buy my trinkets.

2550
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:50,890
No,
they're going to buy a Poncho,

2551
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:51,610
you know.

2552
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:56,670
Whereas at four they were going to come 
with fucking swords and kill your 

2553
02:00:56,670 --> 02:00:57,820
family.
So do you watch the TV series vikings?

2554
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:58,550
No,
I didn't.

2555
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:00,000
It's pretty bad us.
Really?

2556
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:00,670
Yeah,
I like it.

2557
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:01,090
See,
I,

2558
02:01:01,230 --> 02:01:03,400
uh,
I'd never heard anything about it.

2559
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:06,400
Rarely gets good.
Photography is awesome.

2560
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:08,490
This is pretty good.
It's.

2561
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:13,500
And there's these ones scene that I was 
watching from the third season where 

2562
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:13,860
there's this critical viking standing 
outside of batteries.

2563
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:18,890
So you see,
it seemed the distance though the shape 

2564
02:01:18,890 --> 02:01:19,190
and it's beautiful that you see these 
pieces.

2565
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:20,680
DOLLF semi-naked,
Vikings.

2566
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:22,870
We put our trust and they are starting 
to scream.

2567
02:01:23,470 --> 02:01:25,990
It's acts dive.
It's so hard to tie,

2568
02:01:25,991 --> 02:01:27,640
but you know,
it's like about a show.

2569
02:01:27,641 --> 02:01:30,540
That's where they're screaming.
It's time and its sword time.

2570
02:01:30,630 --> 02:01:33,000
Exactly how it's hammertime.
What about Hammerton?

2571
02:01:33,110 --> 02:01:33,730
Excited?
No.

2572
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:36,910
I'm married.
Escaped habitat and the.

2573
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:39,650
That's a lot of fuel,
but he's 30 there.

2574
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:40,070
That's

2575
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:45,070
a lot of human history.
People that have and people that have 

2576
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:47,381
not and the have nots show up at the 
gates and they are hungry and they are 

2577
02:01:47,381 --> 02:01:48,770
more motivated than New Yorkers.
They are hungry.

2578
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:54,190
It is amazing that this is one of the 
only times that we've ever recorded 

2579
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:59,171
where people show up in places where 
they don't know anybody in their 

2580
02:01:59,171 --> 02:01:59,171
welcome.
Yeah.

2581
02:01:59,990 --> 02:02:01,360
You're welcome all over the world.
Yeah,

2582
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:01,800
no.
Could.

2583
02:02:01,801 --> 02:02:06,801
He said Ryan,
as there are many people who have their 

2584
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:06,801
theory that like way,
way,

2585
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:09,500
way in a distant past in the hunting and
gathering time,

2586
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:14,501
people are not more Amandla.
There was less war and then there's the 

2587
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:14,501
other camp or that argues.
No,

2588
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:15,770
no.
The hunting and gathering tiny store,

2589
02:02:15,790 --> 02:02:18,500
crazy column for the ats.
Just he didn't tap into it often because

2590
02:02:18,501 --> 02:02:23,501
there were a few people,
so they don't run into each other that 

2591
02:02:23,501 --> 02:02:24,380
much and the reality realities,
I don't know,

2592
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:24,920
is that right?

2593
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:28,730
I don't think either one is completely 
right in the sense that I don't think he

2594
02:02:28,731 --> 02:02:33,731
was at peace and love scenario because 
that's not how human beings operate and 

2595
02:02:33,731 --> 02:02:37,451
I don't think he was a small deal that 
totally states can save you from 

2596
02:02:37,451 --> 02:02:39,590
violence because otherwise everybody's 
always killing each other.

2597
02:02:39,591 --> 02:02:42,470
I don't necessarily think of that Cedar,
but clear.

2598
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:47,500
I mean we do have evidence that people 
bash each other brains forever for a 

2599
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,860
long time.
Our frequent that was,

2600
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:53,861
that's the question and there are 
different schools of thought in that 

2601
02:02:53,861 --> 02:02:54,200
regard and it's kind of hard to come up.
We took a glues,

2602
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:56,750
events are,
but other than that scenario,

2603
02:02:56,751 --> 02:03:01,751
which is so far in the past that we 
don't have solid evidence on for match 

2604
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:05,810
of the history that we do every courts 
about.

2605
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:11,230
Yeah.
People do nasty shit to each other all 

2606
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:11,230
the time.
Yeah.

2607
02:03:11,230 --> 02:03:12,620
I think Chris is talking about tribal 
cultures that live,

2608
02:03:12,680 --> 02:03:17,680
you know,
indigenous people that live in the 

2609
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:17,680
jungle and shit like that.
I think when it's resource dependent,

2610
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:20,510
I think when there's a lot of resources 
and there's plenty of women to fuck.

2611
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:21,510
Yeah,
everybody's.

2612
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,930
I Have Ryan also.
He loves those polyamorous society.

2613
02:03:26,420 --> 02:03:27,230
He loves it.

2614
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:32,120
Yeah.
He loves those.

2615
02:03:32,121 --> 02:03:36,080
The concept of these cultures that 
existed that didn't have,

2616
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:39,500
they weren't able to trace lines of male
paternity,

2617
02:03:39,790 --> 02:03:41,960
so the entire villages would raise 
children,

2618
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:45,380
which exists right now,
and this is some parts of the world,

2619
02:03:45,381 --> 02:03:46,070
you know,
I mean that,

2620
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:51,080
that's,
that's how some indigenous cultures 

2621
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,130
still operate to this day,
but yet there's also indigenous cultures

2622
02:03:52,131 --> 02:03:54,560
like the ones in New Guinea,
which,

2623
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:56,530
uh,
the sperm warriors beginning,

2624
02:03:56,570 --> 02:03:57,230
which is,
you know,

2625
02:03:57,231 --> 02:03:59,120
that story right there.
Remind me later.

2626
02:03:59,121 --> 02:04:02,710
I know somebody been fighting,
going on about some.

2627
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:04,820
What's up with disparate warrior.
Awful,

2628
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:06,260
awful.
Pedophilia.

2629
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:11,290
They,
they will take children at a very young 

2630
02:04:11,290 --> 02:04:11,660
age and make them consume calm.
Yep.

2631
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,720
Both in their ass and in their mouth.
And Make God mad.

2632
02:04:14,850 --> 02:04:15,520
Yes.
Yeah.

2633
02:04:15,530 --> 02:04:16,630
They call you the,
the,

2634
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:19,610
the,
the leave their parents and go stay with

2635
02:04:19,611 --> 02:04:20,660
what they call their anus.

2636
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:21,970
Father Jesus.
Yeah.

2637
02:04:21,971 --> 02:04:23,390
There's,
Oh God.

2638
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:25,080
And they'd been doing this for thousands
of years.

2639
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:29,240
For whatever reason.
This became a style of living.

2640
02:04:29,241 --> 02:04:34,170
Somebody was really into little kids 
when they see the doc,

2641
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:39,220
the gods have spoken theses,
how you'll make her yell the message 

2642
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:42,780
from upon high,
from now on.

2643
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:46,080
It's not romanticizing,
etc.

2644
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:47,880
But at the same time,
demonizing,

2645
02:04:47,881 --> 02:04:48,480
get this,
uh,

2646
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:50,700
and I don't mean these [inaudible] yeah,
dc's fuck it up,

2647
02:04:50,701 --> 02:04:54,930
but I mean tribal culture that there's 
great stuff there.

2648
02:04:54,931 --> 02:04:57,480
There's all full of stuff there.
There's human stuff done,

2649
02:04:57,481 --> 02:04:59,700
right?
There's the whole spectrum of it all.

2650
02:04:59,701 --> 02:05:02,200
And I do like what chris is doing in 
terms of,

2651
02:05:03,090 --> 02:05:06,030
I don't know,
it's a historically 100 percent right in

2652
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:08,190
that deBate about are cool or not so 
cool.

2653
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:13,460
Ancient tribal societies were,
but I do like the where is going with in

2654
02:05:13,620 --> 02:05:17,520
terms of what these,
that we can learn either from the actual

2655
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:21,420
history or from something that sound 
cool that may not exactly have that bend

2656
02:05:21,421 --> 02:05:26,421
away,
but the gives as an idea because 

2657
02:05:26,421 --> 02:05:26,421
ultimately what the fuck cares what they
did 10,000

2658
02:05:26,421 --> 02:05:30,171
years ago,
but it's about what you can do now that 

2659
02:05:30,171 --> 02:05:31,230
gives you an idea of what you can do now
to make life better.

2660
02:05:31,560 --> 02:05:33,390
I don't care whether it really happened 
or not.

2661
02:05:33,391 --> 02:05:35,340
If it makes life better now,
I'm happy.

2662
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,720
You know?
Good point.

2663
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,700
That's a really good point.
Like what?

2664
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:40,170
What is possible now?
Yeah,

2665
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:43,440
and I firmly believe now is the best 
time ever.

2666
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:48,530
I mean,
I think we're incredibly lucky to live 

2667
02:05:48,530 --> 02:05:50,271
right now and as long as we don't hit 
some sort of a natural disaster or 

2668
02:05:50,271 --> 02:05:53,010
someone fucks up and accidentally starts
a nuclear war,

2669
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:55,890
I think it's a great time.
He's not perfect,

2670
02:05:55,891 --> 02:05:58,170
but there's no,
there's nothing going to be perfect.

2671
02:05:58,171 --> 02:06:01,380
It's what we were talking about,
just the sheer numbers of humans.

2672
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:03,960
You know,
20 people on an eye with three girls.

2673
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:05,670
17 men.
You're going to have death.

2674
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:07,710
Yeah.
Akiva,

2675
02:06:07,950 --> 02:06:10,880
I don't think one night goes by without 
you here.

2676
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:14,610
China recently,
they changed their one child that day.

2677
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:15,980
Oh yeah.
Like when?

2678
02:06:16,030 --> 02:06:17,160
The last few days.

2679
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:18,110
Really?
Yeah.

2680
02:06:18,930 --> 02:06:21,360
That can go both ways.
I mean on one end you,

2681
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:24,430
the whole female fantasize was fucked up
and the other end,

2682
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:29,480
a China growing dramatically.
Population that's not exactly a good 

2683
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:33,370
thing gator.
So what are they going to do it because 

2684
02:06:33,370 --> 02:06:33,370
there's only like 15 girls,
right?

2685
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:38,480
I guess actually fucked up this idea 
that you would only have men because the

2686
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:41,760
men would be able to take care of you.
Well you,

2687
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:45,960
you guys threw a monkey wrench in your 
whole generation.

2688
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:47,010
They sure did.
What?

2689
02:06:47,011 --> 02:06:49,140
A fucking cluster.
Yep.

2690
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,610
Big time.
Oh,

2691
02:06:51,690 --> 02:06:56,690
can you imagine being a guy and you 
growIng up there and you're on that 

2692
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,730
island with 17 dudes and three women are
like,

2693
02:06:57,830 --> 02:06:58,830
yeah,
fuck.

2694
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:03,960
I know that's,
that's a shitty deal that I got to be 

2695
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,341
the worst.
Trying to get laid as a man in China 

2696
02:07:07,341 --> 02:07:07,341
must be fucking hard.

2697
02:07:07,341 --> 02:07:10,920
I can see how that would not be easy or 
I would imagine people,

2698
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:13,480
high school universe.
But you know,

2699
02:07:13,481 --> 02:07:16,370
a young males would be pretty deep piece
golf.

2700
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:21,470
Condom shares fall after China abandons 
one child shares in companies that make.

2701
02:07:23,370 --> 02:07:26,580
What does that nappies prems and baby 
milk up.

2702
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,170
What is it?
Oh,

2703
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:32,330
I guess like baby stuff up on friday 
after beijing announces plans to change 

2704
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:37,161
family planning laws.
I just don't know how they're going to 

2705
02:07:37,161 --> 02:07:37,161
engineer their population.
I mean,

2706
02:07:37,161 --> 02:07:42,060
this was in response to overpopulation,
that's why they decided to have a one 

2707
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:45,721
child policy,
but that's just not good when everybody 

2708
02:07:45,721 --> 02:07:45,721
wants a man.
Yeah,

2709
02:07:45,721 --> 02:07:50,371
exactly.
Is that they didn't think he threw in 

2710
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:50,371
that scenario because I mean,
I can see the idea.

2711
02:07:50,371 --> 02:07:52,380
You have too many people,
too few resources.

2712
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:53,890
You'll get fuck it up.
You'll kind of do that.

2713
02:07:53,891 --> 02:07:55,540
But at the same time now he's like,
okay,

2714
02:07:55,940 --> 02:08:00,940
nobody was going to have a baby girl,
so let's all have boys because that's 

2715
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:00,940
what I want.

2716
02:08:00,940 --> 02:08:04,680
And so there's this dumb dad that I 
talked to sometimes he's so it's every 

2717
02:08:04,871 --> 02:08:07,720
now and then I get stuck talking to him 
and he's just like,

2718
02:08:07,780 --> 02:08:10,300
he has daughters and he wants sons and 
you know,

2719
02:08:10,430 --> 02:08:11,820
like,
and like,

2720
02:08:12,110 --> 02:08:14,020
dude,
you're fucking daughter's are healthy.

2721
02:08:14,021 --> 02:08:19,021
Like what is wrong with you?
I have a friend who is a child that has 

2722
02:08:19,021 --> 02:08:23,550
severe autism and all these terrible 
behavioral disabilities and he's,

2723
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:25,030
he's a mess.
I'm like,

2724
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:28,390
you're lucky.
You're extremely fortunate.

2725
02:08:28,391 --> 02:08:31,910
You have healthy children in America.
Yeah.

2726
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:36,990
You hit the goddamn lottery and your 
dumb ass is whining that you don't have 

2727
02:08:36,990 --> 02:08:38,700
a son to play softball with and even in 
that light,

2728
02:08:38,710 --> 02:08:42,490
because you can't fucking teach a girl 
to play softball because it's not girly.

2729
02:08:42,540 --> 02:08:47,230
What a of play softball.
Maybe you know the idea that your son is

2730
02:08:47,231 --> 02:08:52,231
an extension of you is one of the 
stupidest fucking attachments that some 

2731
02:08:52,231 --> 02:08:52,231
people have.

2732
02:08:52,231 --> 02:08:53,440
You're,
it's a human being.

2733
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:56,200
The human being.
You're fortunate enough to be the parent

2734
02:08:56,201 --> 02:09:01,201
of this human being,
this idea that you're upset that it's 

2735
02:09:01,201 --> 02:09:02,740
one gender or another,
just shut the fuck up you monkey.

2736
02:09:02,830 --> 02:09:06,460
And that goes back to the stupid 
stereotypes of masculine and family.

2737
02:09:06,461 --> 02:09:09,370
Know what it means to be a man or a 
woman.

2738
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:14,371
It's like,
of course there's genetic stuff and 

2739
02:09:14,371 --> 02:09:14,371
there's not.
That's a given.

2740
02:09:14,371 --> 02:09:17,971
You know,
there's not even an article at 

2741
02:09:17,971 --> 02:09:19,420
simultaneous in nature,
but then there's also a bunch of feet 

2742
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:21,721
that these nurture and these solar rays 
and somebody may have a tendency going 

2743
02:09:21,721 --> 02:09:25,860
one way,
but if you teach them and you can 

2744
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:25,860
balance it out in other ways,
you know,

2745
02:09:25,860 --> 02:09:30,080
he's like,
to me even the most interesting people 

2746
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:30,080
are the ones that I've built that have,
you know,

2747
02:09:30,080 --> 02:09:33,730
the stereotypical sensitivity from the 
supposed to be female,

2748
02:09:33,731 --> 02:09:38,731
but they are always so tough and who the
hell said that being emotionally 

2749
02:09:38,731 --> 02:09:43,510
sensitive is a only for women or that 
being tough is only for men.

2750
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:46,540
I get bored with both people unless you 
have both,

2751
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:49,150
unless I can relate to you on multiple 
levels.

2752
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:51,580
It's pouring.
It's like can be for sure.

2753
02:09:52,290 --> 02:09:54,820
The typical girly girl is like,
jesus,

2754
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:59,620
I'm fearing sick disease killing me.
It's so boring.

2755
02:09:59,621 --> 02:10:02,520
But also the typical guy who breaks a 
beer bottle off,

2756
02:10:02,521 --> 02:10:04,270
he said,
watching affordable.

2757
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:06,760
That's not exactly.
Okay.

2758
02:10:06,761 --> 02:10:09,220
That's great for about 10 minutes and 
then I'm out.

2759
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:14,280
You know,
it's to me it's like the aveda human 

2760
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,640
beings that are strong and sensitive.
What the hell is wrong with that idea?

2761
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:16,380
You know,
it's like,

2762
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:21,930
yeah,
this is why one of the biggest problems 

2763
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:21,930
growing up as if you're stuck in a 
neighborhood,

2764
02:10:21,970 --> 02:10:26,970
if you're stuck in the neighborhood and 
the people in your neighborhood are all 

2765
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:27,640
stupid and there's no one interesting to
draw from.

2766
02:10:27,641 --> 02:10:29,800
There's no one to find that you can 
relate to.

2767
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:32,590
Like I remember being a kid and uh,
you know,

2768
02:10:32,591 --> 02:10:33,980
you have a good friends that you

2769
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:36,320
really enjoy hanging out with and when 
they weren't around,

2770
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,450
he would hang out with dummies and you'd
be like,

2771
02:10:38,510 --> 02:10:41,210
oh my god,
it's so taxing.

2772
02:10:41,510 --> 02:10:43,190
If you,
if you have the wrong,

2773
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:48,220
if you just buy a roll of the dice,
find yourself in a neighborhood where 

2774
02:10:48,220 --> 02:10:52,840
people are prejudiced or ignorant or 
aggressively ignorant or aggressive or 

2775
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:54,560
prejudice.
You could just have a terrible time.

2776
02:10:54,561 --> 02:10:57,620
He just want to stay home and be locked 
in your environment.

2777
02:10:57,621 --> 02:10:59,720
And I think until the internet came 
around,

2778
02:10:59,750 --> 02:11:02,720
that was the biggest issue in children 
growing up.

2779
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:06,800
You were a subject to your environment 
or a victim of your environment.

2780
02:11:06,801 --> 02:11:08,480
Sometimes a product of your environment.

2781
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:10,790
That's why even what we're doing it 
right now,

2782
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:15,791
the idea that somebody in Sweden can 
download and listen to what's happening 

2783
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:17,870
that's 30,
I mean shit.

2784
02:11:17,871 --> 02:11:22,871
I would have loved to grown up with that
possibility of needing to conversation 

2785
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:28,120
so that I'm not traveling to the 
immediate reward that is in the few for 

2786
02:11:28,120 --> 02:11:29,090
where you are born and when you are 
raised,

2787
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:31,740
but you'll get access to and then you 
realize,

2788
02:11:31,741 --> 02:11:36,030
well there are people out there with 
different way of thinking other than.

2789
02:11:36,031 --> 02:11:41,031
I mean think about even when tv came 
around than somebody in the middle of 

2790
02:11:41,031 --> 02:11:44,231
the United States in a town of 5,000
people suddenly could see people who 

2791
02:11:44,231 --> 02:11:48,491
look differently or a different 
conversation has been the most freeing 

2792
02:11:48,491 --> 02:11:49,040
thing in the world.

2793
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:50,700
Unless you were black and they were 
like,

2794
02:11:50,701 --> 02:11:54,770
where the fuck are all the black,
sanford and son?

2795
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:56,100
Yeah.
He like,

2796
02:11:56,101 --> 02:11:59,040
what in the fuck there's got jefferson's
finally,

2797
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:02,820
but he said that funny that like in the 
19 fifties,

2798
02:12:03,130 --> 02:12:05,970
hold the advertise that are sold.
The programmers tilt.

2799
02:12:06,070 --> 02:12:11,070
In order to attract people,
we need to make the content as not 

2800
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,590
controvert like the most uncontroversial
thing possible.

2801
02:12:14,591 --> 02:12:17,140
We make it very square.
We make it very safe.

2802
02:12:17,170 --> 02:12:20,510
No sex,
no violence will make it not end.

2803
02:12:20,550 --> 02:12:20,970
You see,
uh,

2804
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:24,670
what we are attracted to today's one 80 
completely.

2805
02:12:24,671 --> 02:12:29,620
It's like lost weight,
get all that.

2806
02:12:30,950 --> 02:12:32,930
Yeah.
The suppression,

2807
02:12:32,931 --> 02:12:33,640
right?
Yeah.

2808
02:12:33,660 --> 02:12:35,720
It's like we're the rio that's also 
interesting.

2809
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:38,870
Like advertisements,
like advertisements today,

2810
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:41,570
like on the internet,
like podcasts here.

2811
02:12:41,571 --> 02:12:44,210
This is a perfect example.
No one has ever,

2812
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,480
when I do a podcast ad say don't swear 
or don't see something fucked up.

2813
02:12:48,481 --> 02:12:49,810
Like I say,
fucked up things.

2814
02:12:49,811 --> 02:12:52,140
Sometimes these ads,
because I'm winging it,

2815
02:12:52,230 --> 02:12:55,610
is a little long as I'm not saying 
something.

2816
02:12:55,611 --> 02:12:57,440
When I say fucked up,
things are obviously jokes.

2817
02:12:57,470 --> 02:13:02,470
Yeah.
As long as I'm not saying anything 

2818
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:02,900
that's actually racist or homophobic or 
sexist or anything like that,

2819
02:13:03,260 --> 02:13:08,260
people are fine with it and you could 
never have one of my ads on a television

2820
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:09,380
show,
no way,

2821
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:14,620
but the people that watched a television
show or the same people that are going 

2822
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:18,761
to download a lot of podcasts exactly 
like if like someone's listening to 

2823
02:13:18,761 --> 02:13:19,430
howard stern in the morning,
right,

2824
02:13:19,431 --> 02:13:24,431
and they're hearing all this crazy shit 
that's the same person that might watch 

2825
02:13:24,431 --> 02:13:27,320
the big bang theory or america's got 
talent at night and it's squeaky clean.

2826
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:28,500
What's the same human being?
Yeah,

2827
02:13:28,640 --> 02:13:33,640
exactly,
but for whatever reason they decided 

2828
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:36,620
this human being can accept it in this 
form but can accept it in that form like

2829
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:41,550
you might.
You might watch something that's totally

2830
02:13:41,551 --> 02:13:46,551
squeaky clean and the advertisers are,
but the same person might go to a rated 

2831
02:13:46,551 --> 02:13:51,081
r movie and watch crazy violence and 
death and some fucking horror film.

2832
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:55,170
It's.
It's weird what we decide people can and

2833
02:13:55,171 --> 02:13:58,290
cannot be subjected to cannot be exposed
to that.

2834
02:13:58,350 --> 02:14:02,300
Especially with nudity.
One kind of nudity,

2835
02:14:02,400 --> 02:14:04,290
alto,
my automatically is the highest possible

2836
02:14:04,291 --> 02:14:06,630
that because that's gonna fuck up your 
brain,

2837
02:14:06,631 --> 02:14:07,680
right?
If you see a boob,

2838
02:14:07,681 --> 02:14:09,360
but now y'all are going to be screwed 
for life.

2839
02:14:09,361 --> 02:14:10,590
It's like,
really?

2840
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:12,630
That's what you are scared to show your 
kids.

2841
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:16,710
Would you remember vincent gallo know?
What does it mean to send vincent gallo?

2842
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:17,700
That's his name,
right?

2843
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:19,080
Vincent gallo,
the actor,

2844
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:19,860
that's his name,
right?

2845
02:14:19,861 --> 02:14:21,480
There's an advancing gal.
He it.

2846
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:26,700
He was a very respected actor,
like a really intense guy and he did 

2847
02:14:27,151 --> 02:14:30,420
this movie.
He produced it and started in it called,

2848
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:33,570
I think it was called brown bunny and it
was with this chick.

2849
02:14:33,571 --> 02:14:36,210
Chloe's va yankee.
I don't know how the fuck you say,

2850
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:39,360
very good actress,
excellent actress,

2851
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:42,540
but they had a real sex scene in the 
movie and in this,

2852
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:44,310
in the movie,
she sucks his cock,

2853
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:49,560
like she really blows and he comes in 
her face and on her mouth and it's real 

2854
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:54,680
and people were fucking furious.
People that went to see the movie hated 

2855
02:14:54,680 --> 02:14:58,500
him and they were furious and it fucking
tanked his career.

2856
02:14:58,700 --> 02:15:01,850
I mean tanked his career.
Never even heard of that.

2857
02:15:01,851 --> 02:15:02,640
That's crazy.
Well,

2858
02:15:02,641 --> 02:15:07,641
he's done some stuff since then,
but not much and he's done like some 

2859
02:15:07,641 --> 02:15:08,080
vodka ads,
like some vodka commercials,

2860
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:12,930
but before that he was like,
this guy that was like this go to guy if

2861
02:15:12,931 --> 02:15:17,931
you wanted this like really intense 
character and he's a very good app and 

2862
02:15:17,931 --> 02:15:20,160
just like,
you know a guy who just decided,

2863
02:15:20,161 --> 02:15:21,700
look,
I'm going to take a crazy channel.

2864
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:22,560
It's like,
look,

2865
02:15:22,561 --> 02:15:27,561
we have these quintin tarantino movies 
where guys are getting their ears cut 

2866
02:15:27,561 --> 02:15:30,081
off where they're taking these crazy 
chances with violence and pulp fiction 

2867
02:15:30,081 --> 02:15:31,600
where the guy gets shot in the head and 
sprain,

2868
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:36,700
splatter over the back seat and there's 
all these racial slurs being thrown 

2869
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:37,320
around by white people to black people.
This is all fine,

2870
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:39,840
but a guy getting his cock sucked in a 
movie.

2871
02:15:40,380 --> 02:15:45,380
You could see like if she dropped down 
to our knees and you only saw the back 

2872
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:46,650
of her head and she was sucking his 
cock,

2873
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:47,930
that will be okay.
That it's fine.

2874
02:15:48,110 --> 02:15:49,140
It'll be okay.
I know,

2875
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:54,060
but to see his actual penis in her 
actual mouth for whatever reason,

2876
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:55,800
people were like,
no fucking way.

2877
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:56,880
That's it for you,
dude.

2878
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:57,960
We're done.
Yeah,

2879
02:15:57,961 --> 02:15:59,070
that's.
Yeah.

2880
02:15:59,950 --> 02:16:03,450
I always find it so weird.
Everybody wants their dick sucked.

2881
02:16:03,730 --> 02:16:05,080
If you have a dick,
you want it.

2882
02:16:05,110 --> 02:16:09,150
Soft is the one universal truth because 
even if you're gay,

2883
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:10,320
right?
If you want it,

2884
02:16:10,321 --> 02:16:12,750
suck by flies anyway.
If you're straight,

2885
02:16:12,751 --> 02:16:13,800
you want to suck back.
Right?

2886
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,960
Everybody loves blowjobs.
They're amazing.

2887
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:21,080
It's one of the greatest inventions that
anybody ever figured out was that if 

2888
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:21,080
someone's sucks,
your dip,

2889
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:25,671
it feels fantastic.
To watch it in a movie is somehow 

2890
02:16:25,671 --> 02:16:27,660
horrifically offensive.
I totally consensual.

2891
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:30,370
We're not watching you.
We're watching a totally consensual

2892
02:16:30,370 --> 02:16:31,930
sex act in a movie.
Meanwhile,

2893
02:16:31,931 --> 02:16:34,600
the same people that were offended 
probably watch porn,

2894
02:16:34,810 --> 02:16:35,530
right?
Of course,

2895
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:40,531
but as long as the windows are closed 
and the shades are shut and the door is 

2896
02:16:40,531 --> 02:16:43,951
closed and no one can hear them,
then they can pick and jerk off and 

2897
02:16:44,111 --> 02:16:46,840
they're hypocritical world and they 
think it's okay.

2898
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:50,650
I don't remember if I mentioned that to 
you before or knowledge because I always

2899
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:56,040
cracks me up so much,
but there was a study neva know in Utah 

2900
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:56,040
a few years ago where,
uh,

2901
02:16:56,140 --> 02:17:01,140
because the standard way,
the supreme court at the top of the 

2902
02:17:01,140 --> 02:17:03,571
obscenity laws,
they basically said that it boils down 

2903
02:17:03,571 --> 02:17:04,640
to the standards of the community of 
what the defined obscene or nothin swing

2904
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:05,410
uta.
They were saying,

2905
02:17:05,411 --> 02:17:07,120
well,
we are a very conservative community,

2906
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:07,930
so we,
uh,

2907
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,180
we want the old,
the old tale chains.

2908
02:17:11,330 --> 02:17:14,950
You need to not be able to allow to use 
porn.

2909
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:20,070
They cannot sell barn is the number one 
thing on the paper view in hotels are 

2910
02:17:20,730 --> 02:17:21,160
like,
nope,

2911
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:23,320
because the fence the standards of our 
community.

2912
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:28,830
So then they did these research and 
found out a porn consumption in Utah is 

2913
02:17:28,830 --> 02:17:32,611
actually way higher than most other 
places to find what people say.

2914
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:38,090
I will have people who are completely 
different and that's how I find it 

2915
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:43,740
affected.
I think about being comfortable in your 

2916
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:43,740
skin to me is like,
look,

2917
02:17:43,740 --> 02:17:45,820
you like porn race.
It's just accepted.

2918
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:49,450
It's who you are as long as they are not
key people,

2919
02:17:49,451 --> 02:17:52,330
as long as you're not doing anything 
horrible to other human beings.

2920
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:56,320
Acts.
Don't put forward this image of what you

2921
02:17:56,321 --> 02:17:58,570
think you should be when you're not that
person.

2922
02:17:58,571 --> 02:18:01,420
If you're not that person,
there's a reason why is not that healthy

2923
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:03,100
for you is not the way you're built to 
be.

2924
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:04,450
It's not.
There's something there.

2925
02:18:04,460 --> 02:18:06,490
They deal with reality,
you know,

2926
02:18:06,491 --> 02:18:08,860
deal with where you're at and if you 
want to change yourself,

2927
02:18:08,861 --> 02:18:11,080
then take a few baby steps away from 
that,

2928
02:18:11,081 --> 02:18:14,440
but start accepting the fed that dcs 
where you are.

2929
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:16,480
This is what you like.
This is what you don't.

2930
02:18:16,990 --> 02:18:20,970
Then if you decide you want to change,
you can work on the address.

2931
02:18:20,971 --> 02:18:25,971
You're not going to change dramatically 
because you don't change the essence of 

2932
02:18:25,971 --> 02:18:25,971
who you are,
but you can,

2933
02:18:25,971 --> 02:18:26,530
you know,
smooth the edges if you really,

2934
02:18:26,531 --> 02:18:28,540
really want,
but that never happened.

2935
02:18:28,541 --> 02:18:31,330
Something like that.
You start with realizing what it is that

2936
02:18:31,331 --> 02:18:34,240
you are and you stare at it and accept 
it for what it is.

2937
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:39,260
You know?
It's interesting too because I think 

2938
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:41,221
that a lot of what people are worried 
about is other people's perceptions of 

2939
02:18:41,221 --> 02:18:45,601
them and those same people are shielding
their own reality from other people.

2940
02:18:45,970 --> 02:18:48,970
Worried about their perceptions.
They might all be into the same thing.

2941
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:50,460
Exactly.
Exactly.

2942
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:52,450
There's um,
uh,

2943
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:55,270
the podcast center the other day coming 
up,

2944
02:18:55,271 --> 02:18:59,110
I sent it to the world but a while back 
and he was reading through and one thing

2945
02:18:59,111 --> 02:19:01,060
that he was cracked up about is like 
men,

2946
02:19:01,061 --> 02:19:06,061
you have zero filter your toys,
like the staff you say about what you 

2947
02:19:06,061 --> 02:19:06,200
think,
what.

2948
02:19:07,090 --> 02:19:10,980
That's not the kind of theme that boss 
people that meet to you though.

2949
02:19:10,990 --> 02:19:13,780
That's the kind of stuff that it's a 
socially.

2950
02:19:13,781 --> 02:19:15,820
Most people who are professors.
Yeah.

2951
02:19:15,821 --> 02:19:18,010
Never mind that.
That's a big one.

2952
02:19:18,150 --> 02:19:19,070
Your world,
right?

2953
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:24,120
Yeah.
Where does this image of how we are 

2954
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:25,741
supposed to be?
And to me it's like that's such 

2955
02:19:25,741 --> 02:19:25,741
bullshit.
It's like a,

2956
02:19:25,741 --> 02:19:25,840
b,
b,

2957
02:19:25,841 --> 02:19:30,841
a you on being about that extra freedom 
because you have podcasts and because 

2958
02:19:31,251 --> 02:19:36,251
you can,
you can express yourself through that 

2959
02:19:36,251 --> 02:19:36,251
and you can actually make money doing 
that too.

2960
02:19:36,251 --> 02:19:39,730
So it's,
it's you have these other outlets for 

2961
02:19:39,730 --> 02:19:39,730
expression.
Yeah,

2962
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:44,770
I mean I think I realized I had these,
a really stupid idea for a long time 

2963
02:19:44,770 --> 02:19:48,800
that I could get a regular gig in 
academia as I see it.

2964
02:19:48,801 --> 02:19:53,801
He goes by fast surrender and I could 
have also the space to do all the other 

2965
02:19:53,801 --> 02:19:55,250
stuff.
And then I realized this was actually,

2966
02:19:55,550 --> 02:20:00,550
I remember beating my office one day 
after the realization that most 

2967
02:20:00,550 --> 02:20:01,670
academics don't like me sync,
sung keen.

2968
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:04,540
Most academics don't like you.
Why not?

2969
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:10,060
Because I'm a student like me.
If they don't like them,

2970
02:20:10,191 --> 02:20:13,250
that means oh,
you must be too easy or too something or

2971
02:20:13,251 --> 02:20:18,251
sort of fed that.
I get along very well with students and 

2972
02:20:18,251 --> 02:20:20,860
that's not always the case with them.
That's usually strike against me and 

2973
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:23,300
also when I was having this,
oh,

2974
02:20:23,301 --> 02:20:24,680
why is it that I didn't like me?

2975
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:27,730
I don't understand.
I kind of step outside and it for my.

2976
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:30,140
And he was,
I mean my office hours,

2977
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:35,230
I'm playing him.
He named me my office and I have around 

2978
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:35,230
my neck,
our strap,

2979
02:20:35,230 --> 02:20:39,591
the globes that are just used to spar 
with one of my students during a break 

2980
02:20:39,591 --> 02:20:43,780
in my hand is my medical marihuana and 
you had a blog he'd but why don't they 

2981
02:20:46,140 --> 02:20:47,590
just like,
well,

2982
02:20:48,120 --> 02:20:53,120
if they like you,
there wouldn't be something we didn't 

2983
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:54,890
decide.
What do you expect they are with her and

2984
02:20:54,891 --> 02:20:56,760
that's fine.
That's the eighties,

2985
02:20:56,870 --> 02:21:01,870
but you can't expect to be just because 
you're polite and you opened the door 

2986
02:21:01,870 --> 02:21:03,200
for people that are,
that's nice,

2987
02:21:03,230 --> 02:21:06,320
but you're still if a very different 
animal from what they are.

2988
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:10,250
And so of course they are now gonna 
embrace you as one of the few guys.

2989
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:13,010
I bet you and daddy asked russell if you
were in the same staff,

2990
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:14,300
get along great.
Sure,

2991
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:15,710
sure.
There's a few.

2992
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:17,390
There's,
there's people out there that are.

2993
02:21:17,690 --> 02:21:18,410
No.
Absolutely,

2994
02:21:18,411 --> 02:21:20,330
and in fact,
I'm not saying all people,

2995
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:23,650
all academics are all equally.
Steve barring gas,

2996
02:21:23,651 --> 02:21:25,850
so that's not the case.
There are some radical people,

2997
02:21:25,851 --> 02:21:30,851
but the culture,
the general culture of what you're 

2998
02:21:30,851 --> 02:21:31,370
supposed to fit in is a,
it's a very steep one.

2999
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:32,890
Do you feel like,
I mean,

3000
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:35,520
you've been a professor for a while.
Do you feel like the,

3001
02:21:35,560 --> 02:21:37,670
uh,
the culture is shifting?

3002
02:21:41,030 --> 02:21:45,050
The culture outside of academia shifts a
lot faster than the culture inside,

3003
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:50,490
like cooling institutions,
they tend to be the last place to 

3004
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:53,351
change.
It's like when everybody else gets to 

3005
02:21:53,351 --> 02:21:54,680
accept something that maybe they will.
It's kind of like politics,

3006
02:21:54,681 --> 02:21:59,681
you know,
whereas like after 99 percent of people 

3007
02:21:59,681 --> 02:21:59,960
in us will be put on legalization of 
marijuana,

3008
02:21:59,961 --> 02:22:04,961
then some politician will say,
we'll do this really daring thing and 

3009
02:22:04,961 --> 02:22:04,961
try to,
you know,

3010
02:22:04,961 --> 02:22:09,410
it's not going to start from the inside 
at any establishment is built on keeping

3011
02:22:09,411 --> 02:22:11,320
the status quo.
So that's nowhere.

3012
02:22:11,530 --> 02:22:13,460
So I locked off.
If anything,

3013
02:22:13,461 --> 02:22:18,461
a lot of academia I'm seeing,
he's becoming more and more 

3014
02:22:18,461 --> 02:22:21,161
bureaucratic.
There's more of a do measurable seeings 

3015
02:22:21,161 --> 02:22:24,440
do stuff that everything can be 
accounted for so we don't get sued.

3016
02:22:24,470 --> 02:22:29,470
Make sure to do.
There's a lot less flexibility and 

3017
02:22:29,470 --> 02:22:32,190
allowing people to kind of run the show 
as they like it because they're like,

3018
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:35,010
what if somebody runs it the wrong way 
and they will get sued,

3019
02:22:35,011 --> 02:22:40,011
which sure that is a concern,
but you're also eliminating the 

3020
02:22:40,011 --> 02:22:42,000
possibility of people doing cool things 
in the process and so I don't know.

3021
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:47,001
I don't see,
don't see tremendously good changes in 

3022
02:22:47,001 --> 02:22:47,001
that regard.

3023
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:52,100
What about the,
the changes in as far as political 

3024
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:52,390
correctness or the,
uh,

3025
02:22:52,391 --> 02:22:57,391
the ideologies on campus,
they seemed to be more extreme and more 

3026
02:22:57,391 --> 02:22:59,130
left wing now than they have in any time
in the most recent history,

3027
02:22:59,370 --> 02:23:00,870
at least.
Obviously I'm not in school,

3028
02:23:00,871 --> 02:23:05,220
but from people that are reporting on it
and professors that I've interviewed,

3029
02:23:05,620 --> 02:23:10,620
I know I'm pulling for you,
has done that because honestly I hear 

3030
02:23:10,620 --> 02:23:11,580
about it a lot.
I read it in the newspapers,

3031
02:23:11,581 --> 02:23:15,060
I hear about it from other people 
telling me I don't see it.

3032
02:23:15,270 --> 02:23:16,750
What do you experience?
You know,

3033
02:23:16,751 --> 02:23:21,751
the whole extreme level of political 
correctness is not one that I have two 

3034
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:25,530
that I witness a lot.
I get to what I do.

3035
02:23:25,531 --> 02:23:27,630
I say what I say,
nobody gets pissed off,

3036
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:31,910
nobody yelled at me over.
It tends to be fairly injera guarders,

3037
02:23:31,911 --> 02:23:36,911
tila little and I don't see my students 
getting offended that I ever seen the 

3038
02:23:36,911 --> 02:23:39,990
way you would read based on websites and
I'm not saying that that doesn't exist.

3039
02:23:39,991 --> 02:23:42,120
I'm sure it does.
I mean it must be based on something.

3040
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:47,600
I just don't think he's quite as either.
I'm extremely lucky for some reason or 

3041
02:23:47,600 --> 02:23:50,940
he's not quite as pervasive as it sounds
on paper,

3042
02:23:51,180 --> 02:23:56,180
but I don't know because you know,
of course all I know is my experience 

3043
02:23:56,180 --> 02:23:56,180
and that may not be representative of 
what's out there.

3044
02:23:56,460 --> 02:24:01,460
It's also probably indicative of the 
sheer numbers of people that are in 

3045
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:05,181
school.
Did you ever see that old bill hicks 

3046
02:24:05,181 --> 02:24:07,941
bit?
Bill hicks had this really funny bit 

3047
02:24:07,941 --> 02:24:07,941
about cnn,
about how you.

3048
02:24:07,941 --> 02:24:12,360
Every time you turn the news,
murdered death pit bulls and he goes and

3049
02:24:12,361 --> 02:24:14,880
then you go look out the window when you
hear a chirp chirp.

3050
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:17,640
He was where the flux all this shit 
happened.

3051
02:24:18,910 --> 02:24:23,790
But I think just the sheer numbers of 
human beings that are in school.

3052
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:25,800
If you're dealing with,
you know,

3053
02:24:25,860 --> 02:24:29,100
how many millions of kids are in school,
I don't know how many there are,

3054
02:24:29,310 --> 02:24:34,310
but out of those you're going to be able
to cherry pick some extreme examples of 

3055
02:24:34,681 --> 02:24:37,440
social justice warriors,
political correct thinking,

3056
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:40,290
you know,
progressive thinking,

3057
02:24:40,291 --> 02:24:42,900
run a muck.
It's diversity.

3058
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:45,390
Run a mock.
That's what going on.

3059
02:24:45,420 --> 02:24:48,490
I think there's a that makes for a story
that got

3060
02:24:49,360 --> 02:24:53,110
about or as if you talk about the,
he's the same as wide way like water,

3061
02:24:53,111 --> 02:24:58,060
you know,
the extreme out there kind of thing that

3062
02:24:58,061 --> 02:25:00,760
makes people emotional involving the 
story.

3063
02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:03,100
You would report it and people get into 
it.

3064
02:25:03,520 --> 02:25:08,520
Whereas the fuel really talk about what 
a lot of the time happens is not that 

3065
02:25:08,520 --> 02:25:09,670
glamorous and so yeah,
it's not as a reporter.

3066
02:25:09,860 --> 02:25:14,860
Have you had any backlash at all from 
doing like controversial podcast cause 

3067
02:25:14,860 --> 02:25:16,760
you know you don't hold back?

3068
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:18,780
No,
definitely not volunteers,

3069
02:25:18,810 --> 02:25:21,290
but I think algae is that probably these
are not the same.

3070
02:25:21,291 --> 02:25:24,520
People will listen to podcasts,
care or date.

3071
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,620
They brother.
This is so good.

3072
02:25:26,621 --> 02:25:30,160
It is.
I was in a history department meeting.

3073
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:35,400
I won't mention the school.
None of that makes a difference because 

3074
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:35,400
it's the same scene,
probably 99 percent of them,

3075
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:38,650
but they were talking and this is like 
30 people or whatever.

3076
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:42,010
Many people who are historians who 
that's what they do.

3077
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:44,500
Right,
and when I mentioned dan carlin hardcore

3078
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:47,550
history,
nobody knew what I was talking about and

3079
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:49,800
fucking kidding me.
He's like,

3080
02:25:49,980 --> 02:25:54,980
you are a historian.
That's the number one history podcast 

3081
02:25:55,060 --> 02:25:58,570
out there is one on the planet podcast 
period of any kind.

3082
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:03,720
It's amazing the guys at god at lane 
this game in 90 minute or theme like you

3083
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:09,151
didn't even bother checking.
What's that tells me that you're so 

3084
02:26:09,151 --> 02:26:11,490
locked in a tower out there,
then you have no idea what's.

3085
02:26:12,460 --> 02:26:17,460
I was blown away.
I mean even I was surprised and they 

3086
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,530
have really bad feelings about academia 
to begin with and I was.

3087
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:21,190
That was too much.
Even for me.

3088
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:24,130
How is someone in the world of history 
not find out about that?

3089
02:26:24,131 --> 02:26:27,160
That seems like it's such a 
revolutionary way to distribute history.

3090
02:26:27,161 --> 02:26:28,260
Yeah,
precisely,

3091
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:33,270
but that tells you how insulated are 
days where it's about what's in the 

3092
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:34,340
food.
To note on page three,

3093
02:26:34,360 --> 02:26:38,890
57 of the monograph that has been read 
by four people they may know about,

3094
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:43,920
but that's weird that weird world yet,
but you know that weird world is what 

3095
02:26:44,621 --> 02:26:48,610
got people to this age today where we 
can do things like hardcore history.

3096
02:26:48,611 --> 02:26:53,611
I mean that was all created by the 
knowledge that was taught through 

3097
02:26:53,611 --> 02:26:55,170
schools and then dda bidding that 
happened,

3098
02:26:55,240 --> 02:26:56,710
one of his podcast where you say,
look,

3099
02:26:56,711 --> 02:27:01,030
in the past history was a bit more 
holistic in nature where goofy story on,

3100
02:27:01,031 --> 02:27:06,031
so we're also good storytellers and they
may have not been quite the same level 

3101
02:27:06,031 --> 02:27:07,740
of researchers,
but they were really good storytellers.

3102
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:13,290
History is moving more and more in the 
direction of a good nerds will heat the 

3103
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:17,911
lie that are your.
Now you don't have to go to the library 

3104
02:27:17,911 --> 02:27:20,131
or do it online,
but that are hardcore into research of 

3105
02:27:20,131 --> 02:27:20,520
primary sources and you need it.
You know,

3106
02:27:20,530 --> 02:27:25,530
of course you need that skill because 
otherwise you don't have the data to 

3107
02:27:25,530 --> 02:27:25,530
subpoena.
Good story about that,

3108
02:27:25,530 --> 02:27:27,820
but if that's the history that's out 
there,

3109
02:27:27,821 --> 02:27:32,821
you can have the most accurate history 
in the ward and nobody wanted to eat it 

3110
02:27:32,821 --> 02:27:33,910
because these guys can tell it because 
it's dry.

3111
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:38,940
You need a bullet,
you know you need the hardcore 

3112
02:27:38,940 --> 02:27:40,660
researcher would dig south,
32 beats it in there.

3113
02:27:40,750 --> 02:27:45,750
Then you need the ones who can spin it 
in a way to that can communicate with 

3114
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:47,920
other human beings that people that can 
make an mk or they can make it a mean.

3115
02:27:47,921 --> 02:27:52,921
Interested can and these are often not 
the same people because it requires a 

3116
02:27:52,921 --> 02:27:53,860
very different balance.
Yeah.

3117
02:27:53,861 --> 02:27:57,550
That's a lot of people say about neil 
degrasse tyson as well,

3118
02:27:57,551 --> 02:28:01,180
that he's a.
He's such a brilliant man,

3119
02:28:01,181 --> 02:28:06,181
but a brilliant communicator like that.
His real skill is in making it 

3120
02:28:06,181 --> 02:28:09,320
entertaining and exciting and an 
absorbable upset.

3121
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:14,430
Whereas the the dry lectures that you 
might listen to from a physics 

3122
02:28:14,430 --> 02:28:15,400
professor,
nobody cares.

3123
02:28:15,401 --> 02:28:17,440
It's just not get in there for whatever 
reason,

3124
02:28:17,441 --> 02:28:19,860
but you need that guy.
Sure you need it.

3125
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:21,980
Has that desire acquire that

3126
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:26,980
information.
The problem with academia is that they 

3127
02:28:26,980 --> 02:28:29,771
have made that guy the only.
That's the measuring stick of what the 

3128
02:28:29,771 --> 02:28:31,490
historian is.
That's one side of it.

3129
02:28:31,550 --> 02:28:34,640
It's an important one and I give you.
That is an important one,

3130
02:28:34,641 --> 02:28:37,580
but it cannot be the only one because 
there's a reason,

3131
02:28:37,581 --> 02:28:41,150
like every single one of the best books 
I've ever read,

3132
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:43,090
he's always said eaten by a Jordan 
released.

3133
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:46,190
He's never written by a historian 
because Jordan is.

3134
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:49,730
They are paid to know how to tell a 
story to make it.

3135
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:54,800
You know the reason why you're paid is 
because you need to hook a reader in 

3136
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:57,330
that doesn't have to read that story 
that makes you want to.

3137
02:28:58,010 --> 02:29:00,530
Dan.
His background was as a journalist,

3138
02:29:00,531 --> 02:29:03,560
you know it's about people who nobody 
owes you.

3139
02:29:03,561 --> 02:29:08,450
Their attention is you intrigue them and
so they want to pay attention.

3140
02:29:08,800 --> 02:29:13,800
That's that skill.
Most of the people who are professional 

3141
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:17,891
historians in a traditional sense that 
talent is not encourage is not something

3142
02:29:18,891 --> 02:29:21,980
you may have it by luck because that's 
how you are as a human being,

3143
02:29:22,010 --> 02:29:24,490
but it's not something that you are 
encouraged to develop.

3144
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:27,120
As part of being a good historian that 
seen as I add,

3145
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,010
that's popularizing it.
That's.

3146
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:30,170
Yeah.
What's wrong with that?

3147
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:32,990
To be able to make something accessible 
to people.

3148
02:29:32,991 --> 02:29:35,990
Isn't that funny though?
That will be shunned.

3149
02:29:36,380 --> 02:29:40,430
Popularizing something that's as 
important as the historical record.

3150
02:29:40,490 --> 02:29:45,490
Yup.
It's one of the most important things 

3151
02:29:45,490 --> 02:29:47,591
for human between human history or for 
human beings rather is to understand 

3152
02:29:47,591 --> 02:29:51,161
history because then you can learn from 
the mistakes of the past and then 

3153
02:29:51,161 --> 02:29:52,110
understand the parallels of what's going
on in the current time.

3154
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:57,640
Like when you look at the roman empire 
and you talk about the great excesses 

3155
02:29:57,640 --> 02:30:01,670
and how that civilization crumbled under
the weight of its own access.

3156
02:30:02,430 --> 02:30:03,920
You look at us now,
you go,

3157
02:30:03,921 --> 02:30:07,490
well there's some parallels here.
People on scooters and disneyland.

3158
02:30:07,491 --> 02:30:10,130
I mean it might not be feeding 
christians to the lions,

3159
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:15,131
but I mean there's.
There's definitely some fucking crazy 

3160
02:30:15,131 --> 02:30:16,760
shit going on right now that they're 
going to look back on when when you look

3161
02:30:16,761 --> 02:30:21,761
at the average american diet and the 
fact that I was in disneyland the other 

3162
02:30:21,761 --> 02:30:25,751
day and I told you that are on scooters,
but one of the other things is they had 

3163
02:30:25,751 --> 02:30:28,931
to change the boats out in the pirates 
of the caribbean ride if everybody's 

3164
02:30:28,931 --> 02:30:33,170
still bad because people are too big.
They've done this several times.

3165
02:30:33,171 --> 02:30:36,440
They've had to change the boats and they
had to dig a deeper trench on.

3166
02:30:36,441 --> 02:30:41,441
It's a small world because over the 
years people have gotten heavier and 

3167
02:30:41,441 --> 02:30:44,951
heavier and they have to accommodate and
they have to take into account the 

3168
02:30:44,951 --> 02:30:46,520
possibility of 600 pound people.

3169
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:52,200
Wow.
That's what they're doing now because I 

3170
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:54,671
saw several 600 plus pound people that 
are just overflowing on their scooters 

3171
02:30:55,550 --> 02:31:00,260
and they also have to help those people 
from their scooters onto these rides.

3172
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:05,340
So these rides have to be reinforced in,
in order to take the weight of several 

3173
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:06,230
people.
I mean,

3174
02:31:06,231 --> 02:31:11,231
a lot of these rides are like you're 
supposed to only get two people in the 

3175
02:31:11,231 --> 02:31:11,270
average to people.
You get two people together,

3176
02:31:11,570 --> 02:31:14,720
you know,
maybe 400 pounds for two people,

3177
02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:19,760
right?
When they got one person the weigh 600 

3178
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:20,640
pounds and so this does this ride's not 
really designed for this,

3179
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:23,610
so that's discrimination.
You've discriminated against,

3180
02:31:23,630 --> 02:31:28,630
are large,
large citizens to these is the most 

3181
02:31:28,630 --> 02:31:33,321
disgusting stories that have ever earned
or say I totally to danko was seeded by 

3182
02:31:33,321 --> 02:31:35,880
podcast is so gross,
but it's sensitive.

3183
02:31:35,881 --> 02:31:38,110
My wife had told me what she was working
in hospital.

3184
02:31:38,110 --> 02:31:38,840
She said,
oh man,

3185
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:43,260
I got pulled over by a colleague.
They told me this story and it's cowered

3186
02:31:43,261 --> 02:31:48,261
by braid ever seeds,
so we'll gladly scoured the brain of 

3187
02:31:48,261 --> 02:31:51,261
everybody listening right now.
So these capital emptied to the doctor 

3188
02:31:51,611 --> 02:31:56,611
or they were complaining about how they 
keep trying to get pregnant and she's 

3189
02:31:56,611 --> 02:32:00,471
not getting pregnant and you know,
the woman was like probably a good 500 

3190
02:32:00,471 --> 02:32:01,030
pounds,
something like that.

3191
02:32:01,050 --> 02:32:03,600
Just rolls of fat everywhere.
The whole thing.

3192
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:05,610
And the doctor was like,
okay,

3193
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,350
let's see what's up.
Let's see.

3194
02:32:07,351 --> 02:32:11,520
What's going on and leave the fat folds 
left or right.

3195
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:15,090
Suddenly he realizes,
oh shit,

3196
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,640
these people thought they were having 
sex,

3197
02:32:18,240 --> 02:32:21,750
but based on the rest of you I'm seeing 
here between the fat falls,

3198
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:27,470
they weren't exactly having sex.
The guy was fucking different folds 

3199
02:32:27,970 --> 02:32:31,280
thinking that he was in where he was and
and ben,

3200
02:32:31,281 --> 02:32:32,330
they were that he,
Hawaii,

3201
02:32:32,350 --> 02:32:33,840
they were not getting pregnant.

3202
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:36,620
They should have let him keep fucking 
the fact fold.

3203
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:38,980
You're real close.
Real close.

3204
02:32:39,720 --> 02:32:41,950
What they told me that I'm like,
oh my god,

3205
02:32:41,951 --> 02:32:46,951
my brain.
I can now get that out of my brain now 

3206
02:32:46,951 --> 02:32:49,670
forever.
I'd never done that will be a standard 

3207
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:49,670
move.
It's just titty fucking fat holds.

3208
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:51,780
It seems.
I'm not shocked at all.

3209
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:53,750
That didn't even make me feel sick 
though.

3210
02:32:53,751 --> 02:32:55,720
Well,
these to the.

3211
02:32:55,750 --> 02:33:00,750
Yeah,
I think has lifted the fat false and 

3212
02:33:00,750 --> 02:33:02,190
finding the rest of you from all the 
failed attempts it seems.

3213
02:33:02,380 --> 02:33:03,090
I don't know.
See,

3214
02:33:03,091 --> 02:33:05,300
I was thinking that they're going to 
find a fetus in there.

3215
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:10,590
I was thinking you were going to say 
that they didn't realize that.

3216
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:11,310
Okay.
Yeah.

3217
02:33:11,311 --> 02:33:12,590
You waiting.
I can see why.

3218
02:33:12,780 --> 02:33:14,080
That's what I was thinking,
you know,

3219
02:33:14,140 --> 02:33:16,440
that's,
that's about it I gave you that.

3220
02:33:16,510 --> 02:33:17,700
I was someone was that fat.

3221
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:19,230
Think they're going to take care of a 
child,

3222
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:24,800
you know,
and the little toddler start running 

3223
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:24,800
around like,
how are you gonna?

3224
02:33:24,800 --> 02:33:26,010
What are you gonna do to get your 
scooter chase him around the park?

3225
02:33:26,070 --> 02:33:28,440
Right.
Well you probably stopped then with food

3226
02:33:28,441 --> 02:33:30,000
day and night,
they'll sit next to you.

3227
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:35,001
One bit,
200 pounds by the time they're three 

3228
02:33:35,001 --> 02:33:37,461
years old.
I've talked about this a bunch of times 

3229
02:33:37,461 --> 02:33:37,461
on the show,
but the,

3230
02:33:37,461 --> 02:33:39,990
you know,
at the possibility of overindulging this

3231
02:33:39,991 --> 02:33:42,560
thought I've stopped eating sugar and 
kind of.

3232
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:47,720
Well I didn't stop but I cut it.
I cut it out completely for two weeks 

3233
02:33:47,720 --> 02:33:48,930
and then I cut it way back since then.
And I will occasionally,

3234
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:54,260
every few days or so I'll allow myself 
one thing like a piece of like this 

3235
02:33:54,871 --> 02:33:56,340
chili mangoes,
you know,

3236
02:33:56,430 --> 02:33:58,170
not angels with Chile that has sugar in 
it,

3237
02:33:58,290 --> 02:33:59,760
but very,
very little sugar.

3238
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:03,960
I lost like eight pounds from that.
Just doing nothing but that it's not the

3239
02:34:03,961 --> 02:34:06,780
same amount.
My energy levels completely different.

3240
02:34:06,781 --> 02:34:08,670
Like through the day,
I don't need.

3241
02:34:08,850 --> 02:34:10,920
I don't get tired towards the end of the
day anymore.

3242
02:34:11,070 --> 02:34:12,540
I just.
It just stayed normal.

3243
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:17,810
It's weird.
That's what our nature is fucked up 

3244
02:34:17,810 --> 02:34:18,160
because she was dark days,
sold them good and yet it's so

3245
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,150
bad for you.
Well,

3246
02:34:19,151 --> 02:34:24,151
it's supposed to taste good in the form 
of fruit because it comes with the 

3247
02:34:24,151 --> 02:34:26,560
reward of vitamins and fiber and all 
this other good stuff that's in fruit,

3248
02:34:26,890 --> 02:34:30,910
but we somehow or another hijack that 
extracted it from the food and shoved it

3249
02:34:30,911 --> 02:34:33,670
into a liquid that comes in a nice 
aluminum can.

3250
02:34:33,671 --> 02:34:37,870
You pop the top and you get that corn 
syrup right into your heart.

3251
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:46,110
But the average american diet is just 
overflowing with sugar and these poor 

3252
02:34:46,271 --> 02:34:51,271
people are just becoming bigger and 
fatter and corn syrup and simple sugars 

3253
02:34:52,601 --> 02:34:56,710
and they're just overwhelmed with this 
excess sugar.

3254
02:34:57,070 --> 02:34:58,590
And it's,
that's the.

3255
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:03,660
I think that's the primary issue that 
people have when it comes to weight 

3256
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:07,081
loss.
Sugars and simple sugars and 

3257
02:35:07,081 --> 02:35:07,750
carbohydrates and,
and uh,

3258
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:12,751
you know,
a simple carbs like pastas and breads 

3259
02:35:12,751 --> 02:35:13,840
and all that stuff which converts to 
sugar,

3260
02:35:13,841 --> 02:35:18,841
alcohol which converts to sugar.
It's all but probably there's also 

3261
02:35:18,841 --> 02:35:21,540
sitting on your ass forever and never 
moving because I mean I see.

3262
02:35:21,541 --> 02:35:24,210
I would like when I go back to 8:30,
I see people

3263
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:27,290
bulleit and people's lawns throws them 
out of past.

3264
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:28,200
Right?
They're like,

3265
02:35:28,250 --> 02:35:29,330
oh,
are you even.

3266
02:35:29,630 --> 02:35:32,550
And yet you see them and skinny most.
Yes.

3267
02:35:32,580 --> 02:35:37,580
I see what I eat,
what I wouldn't be like really are 

3268
02:35:37,761 --> 02:35:42,761
hitting half the box of the whole thing 
were like easy and I feel actually put 

3269
02:35:42,761 --> 02:35:42,761
it to good.
I can go forward more.

3270
02:35:42,761 --> 02:35:43,280
You know,
it's like,

3271
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:46,960
do they have the same wheat in it lands 
where I have no question marks.

3272
02:35:46,961 --> 02:35:48,590
It's clearly something is different 
there.

3273
02:35:48,591 --> 02:35:50,660
You know,
something is not because you cannot.

3274
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,660
If it was just the carbs then that 
would,

3275
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:56,180
should do it then everybody should be 
huge and that's,

3276
02:35:56,181 --> 02:35:58,550
that's not the case.
So something is going on.

3277
02:35:58,790 --> 02:36:03,790
I mean,
I've seen it even with the like if I 

3278
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:03,860
tomatoes in Italy versus tomatoes out 
here,

3279
02:36:04,310 --> 02:36:08,360
tomatoes in Italy are awesome tasting 
and they are feeling,

3280
02:36:08,430 --> 02:36:09,740
you know,
you eat some tomatoes,

3281
02:36:09,741 --> 02:36:13,080
you feel like that can be a big chunk of
your lunch right there.

3282
02:36:13,380 --> 02:36:18,380
I hate tomatoes here.
I feel like I'm drinking water in the 

3283
02:36:18,380 --> 02:36:21,381
right package.
Do they taste like nothing and they 

3284
02:36:21,381 --> 02:36:21,381
don't feel me like it's theoretical.
The same fruit,

3285
02:36:21,381 --> 02:36:26,350
but clearly something has been done 
different in the way they have been 

3286
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:26,350
gmos,
man,

3287
02:36:26,350 --> 02:36:30,620
I don't fucking know,
but I had no idea why or what.

3288
02:36:30,801 --> 02:36:32,480
But clearly the result is different.

3289
02:36:32,730 --> 02:36:34,050
Well,
selective breeding.

3290
02:36:34,051 --> 02:36:39,051
I mean they've,
they've selectively made these tomatoes 

3291
02:36:39,051 --> 02:36:40,020
a much more hardy tomato that doesn't 
taste very good.

3292
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:45,080
Right?
They've bred out all the juiciness 

3293
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:48,920
because they don't last.
Like I have some heirloom tomatoes at 

3294
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:48,920
home,
much spot on the other day.

3295
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:49,590
They're already really soft.
I got to eat them tonight,

3296
02:36:49,890 --> 02:36:54,330
but I think people are lazy and they 
don't go grocery shopping than enough.

3297
02:36:54,331 --> 02:36:56,310
And so he's like,
I want to bike domenico today.

3298
02:36:56,311 --> 02:36:58,150
The last three weeks from now we're 
gonna.

3299
02:36:58,170 --> 02:37:03,170
Look,
just as neil and the fact is it's going 

3300
02:37:03,170 --> 02:37:03,380
to look new,
but you have no thesis.

3301
02:37:03,510 --> 02:37:06,060
What's really in the shipping?
The shipping is the big issue.

3302
02:37:06,061 --> 02:37:07,720
Like being able to get them across the 
country.

3303
02:37:07,721 --> 02:37:08,290
You,
of course,

3304
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:10,560
big truck,
but the heirloom tomatoes,

3305
02:37:10,561 --> 02:37:12,630
I didn't even know they existed until,
you know,

3306
02:37:13,350 --> 02:37:15,320
10 years ago or whatever.
When I first one,

3307
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:16,790
they're fucking delicious.

3308
02:37:16,820 --> 02:37:21,820
They are.
That's what a tomato is supposed to be 

3309
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:21,820
like.
Heck.

3310
02:37:21,820 --> 02:37:23,670
It's like we have this rare to beto.
That's the way it's all right there.

3311
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:27,530
I hope we don't run out of heirloom 
tomato seeds.

3312
02:37:27,531 --> 02:37:32,531
I would cry.
I would really cry if we get to a point 

3313
02:37:32,531 --> 02:37:35,240
some day.
I'm hoping that with all these like um,

3314
02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:40,710
this is new emphasis on craft 
restaurants and craft breweries and 

3315
02:37:40,710 --> 02:37:41,670
craft,
you know,

3316
02:37:42,140 --> 02:37:45,200
people are really into like farm to 
table restaurants.

3317
02:37:45,201 --> 02:37:50,201
There's a lot.
This is a great one near me and they 

3318
02:37:50,201 --> 02:37:52,871
have a,
I get eggs there and the eggs of like a 

3319
02:37:52,871 --> 02:37:55,691
dark orange yolk just like my eggs and 
the food is all from a local farm and 

3320
02:37:55,691 --> 02:37:57,860
they'll tell you like what farm they're 
sourcing their be from.

3321
02:37:58,040 --> 02:38:03,040
It's a great little restaurant,
but I'm hoping that with that sort of 

3322
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:06,890
trend that more and more people embrace 
that and then we'll keep the idea alive.

3323
02:38:06,910 --> 02:38:11,030
Have you know,
real natural foods co.

3324
02:38:11,440 --> 02:38:11,880
Sorry.
No,

3325
02:38:11,890 --> 02:38:12,380
you don't.
That's okay.

3326
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:13,790
I was going to say,
but you know in other,

3327
02:38:14,040 --> 02:38:16,190
in other ways like things like golden 
rice,

3328
02:38:16,191 --> 02:38:18,950
like genetically modified rice that is 
much higher in protein.

3329
02:38:19,190 --> 02:38:22,100
That's helped a lot of people.
Kept a lot of people from starving.

3330
02:38:22,470 --> 02:38:23,850
No,
I'm all for people.

3331
02:38:23,851 --> 02:38:28,851
Having choices is like that thing I 
don't like is when one model become the 

3332
02:38:29,310 --> 02:38:34,310
the only model that you don't let 
anybody else have a choice whether 

3333
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:34,980
there's a problem there is.
If it doesn't,

3334
02:38:35,010 --> 02:38:40,010
I don't even care which one is winning.
The point is if you start having a one 

3335
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:40,800
model lead,
there's a problem there.

3336
02:38:41,460 --> 02:38:46,460
So you do have the people who want none 
of this shit and we out of the way 

3337
02:38:46,460 --> 02:38:50,911
toward the opposite,
it's like we're going to saturate the 

3338
02:38:50,911 --> 02:38:53,031
market so much.
Then we squeeze every other possibility 

3339
02:38:53,031 --> 02:38:53,310
out.
Both of those are shitty choices.

3340
02:38:53,770 --> 02:38:58,770
Like you want to allow as much choice 
out there as possible and in a way to 

3341
02:38:58,770 --> 02:39:00,200
doesn't squash all the other 
possibilities.

3342
02:39:00,740 --> 02:39:05,740
You know,
what I read recently and I thought I 

3343
02:39:05,740 --> 02:39:07,101
thought it was really interesting is 
that mcdonald's is apparently hurting 

3344
02:39:07,101 --> 02:39:11,290
like really badly and that their profits
are down radically from like 20 years 

3345
02:39:11,391 --> 02:39:16,391
ago and that they're thinking that 
eventually that model of really shitty 

3346
02:39:16,391 --> 02:39:21,191
food,
fast food is going to be gone and 

3347
02:39:21,191 --> 02:39:21,380
they're going to be replaced by things 
like in and out burger,

3348
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,990
which is delicious.
They cook it to order,

3349
02:39:24,250 --> 02:39:26,900
takes a little bit more time,
but it's infinitely better.

3350
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:29,390
Exactly.
And that these five guys,

3351
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:34,510
places like that,
that's the new model and then that's 

3352
02:39:34,510 --> 02:39:35,840
what you're going to get.
And then the idea is like if you've been

3353
02:39:35,841 --> 02:39:37,750
to lax recently,
have you been flying that?

3354
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:43,120
Well,
one of the things you notice if you go 

3355
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:44,060
to lax is the restaurant choices have 
gotten dramatically better.

3356
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:47,450
Like you can get really good food at the
airport now,

3357
02:39:47,451 --> 02:39:51,020
like really cool restaurants.
They're not chains and like with this is

3358
02:39:51,021 --> 02:39:53,480
a brilliant idea.
They have a food truck there.

3359
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:54,350
One of the,
uh,

3360
02:39:54,351 --> 02:39:59,351
they have a,
it's like a got a truck of face and 

3361
02:39:59,351 --> 02:39:59,351
then,
you know,

3362
02:39:59,351 --> 02:40:03,241
there's a little restaurant behind it,
but the idea is they're gonna give you 

3363
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:03,241
food like you would get from a food 
truck.

3364
02:40:03,241 --> 02:40:07,630
And so they're,
they're establishing this new sort of a,

3365
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:12,620
a place to get which used to be like 
you'd get chili's,

3366
02:40:12,740 --> 02:40:13,860
you know,
get like

3367
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:19,080
applebee's.
It was like chain restaurants or 

3368
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:19,080
mcdonald's,
stuff like that.

3369
02:40:19,080 --> 02:40:20,160
But now you get like a really nice 
salad.

3370
02:40:20,440 --> 02:40:24,780
You can get us a kale salad with real 
cucumbers and stuff on it and stuff.

3371
02:40:25,110 --> 02:40:30,110
I think people are realizing that just 
because this is the only way we've had 

3372
02:40:30,181 --> 02:40:32,730
before,
but you don't have to have it this way.

3373
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:34,830
No,
I saw this thing on one.

3374
02:40:34,831 --> 02:40:39,831
Oh,
anthony bourdain's shows was on san 

3375
02:40:39,831 --> 02:40:41,190
francisco and one of the guys that runs 
this really nice restaurant was going to

3376
02:40:41,191 --> 02:40:44,490
open up an all vegetarian healthy food 
option,

3377
02:40:44,491 --> 02:40:49,491
a very cheap place in the tenderloin,
which is one of the worst places in san 

3378
02:40:49,491 --> 02:40:53,691
francisco,
and the menu was going to vary between 

3379
02:40:53,691 --> 02:40:53,691
two and $6.
That's it,

3380
02:40:53,691 --> 02:40:58,670
and everything on the menu is between 
two and $6 and they had like a really 

3381
02:40:58,670 --> 02:41:00,000
healthy veggie burger that actually 
tasted good,

3382
02:41:00,001 --> 02:41:01,740
like more dean eight one,
and it's like,

3383
02:41:01,741 --> 02:41:06,741
this is actually,
I would actually go this and they're 

3384
02:41:06,741 --> 02:41:09,180
going to try to provide healthy semi 
fast food for people think that that's a

3385
02:41:09,181 --> 02:41:14,181
good idea I think,
and it's not that difficult because a 

3386
02:41:14,181 --> 02:41:14,580
lot of healthy stuff.

3387
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:17,640
There's the stereotype that all the 
other stuff is crazy expensive.

3388
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:22,700
Not all of it is just a method of 
digging enough of finding scenes that 

3389
02:41:22,700 --> 02:41:26,721
can be nutritious ratios and not crazy 
expensive because there are those 

3390
02:41:26,721 --> 02:41:27,190
options is not.
That seemed pull off all.

3391
02:41:27,191 --> 02:41:32,191
You need to have a bank in order to hit 
the lt or you eat cheaply crop there.

3392
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:33,570
Samo feet.
It's who,

3393
02:41:33,571 --> 02:41:38,571
but not completely.
There are options where you can eat 

3394
02:41:38,571 --> 02:41:41,090
delicious meals that you like to cook.
I've done things to like when they think

3395
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:46,611
about what I just spent and it's nothing
and his fucking deletions and this good 

3396
02:41:46,611 --> 02:41:47,070
food and there's no trade shows and I'm 
like,

3397
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:49,510
what's wrong with that plan?
You know,

3398
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:51,250
why is that?
And I think we'd,

3399
02:41:51,260 --> 02:41:53,340
what you were saying earlier also,
that intrigued me.

3400
02:41:53,341 --> 02:41:58,341
Something I've been obsessed in a bit.
The distance that goes from people 

3401
02:41:58,341 --> 02:42:00,180
eating the food to the food to be 
introduced.

3402
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:02,340
And I don't mean just how far it 
travels,

3403
02:42:02,341 --> 02:42:03,870
but even out disconnected.
We are,

3404
02:42:03,871 --> 02:42:08,871
I don't care,
even if it comes from three miles from 

3405
02:42:08,871 --> 02:42:08,871
me,
I mean it's bad there of course,

3406
02:42:08,871 --> 02:42:09,990
but I mean through the idea of people 
live in,

3407
02:42:09,991 --> 02:42:12,960
at least to some degree,
some contact with the food you eat.

3408
02:42:12,961 --> 02:42:15,270
So you do have,
whether it's,

3409
02:42:15,620 --> 02:42:20,620
you know,
the guy who I had remembered you added 

3410
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:22,880
on the show,
the image of the guy that landed the 

3411
02:42:22,880 --> 02:42:23,970
vertical,
a woods or whatever they call it,

3412
02:42:23,971 --> 02:42:24,720
you know,
like that,

3413
02:42:24,721 --> 02:42:29,721
uh,
is it looked like a skyscraper where 

3414
02:42:29,721 --> 02:42:29,880
they bought a bunch of trees all over it
was you.

3415
02:42:31,720 --> 02:42:35,960
Why don't these plans now was trying to 
figure out how to um,

3416
02:42:36,330 --> 02:42:41,330
put on all the rooftops,
put gardens so that people can have 

3417
02:42:41,330 --> 02:42:45,291
their vegetable gardens even on top of 
like four story buildings or something 

3418
02:42:45,291 --> 02:42:47,040
that there can be the building garden 
that everybody goes.

3419
02:42:47,070 --> 02:42:49,350
Now I don't know how he's going to work 
in terms of what that was.

3420
02:42:49,351 --> 02:42:50,430
Mike domenico,
fuck you,

3421
02:42:50,431 --> 02:42:54,420
I'm going kill you.
But having that idea where it may not be

3422
02:42:54,421 --> 02:42:59,421
old,
you are not self sufficient is not all 

3423
02:42:59,421 --> 02:43:01,611
of your food,
but you have some contact with the food 

3424
02:43:01,611 --> 02:43:01,830
that you're indicating.
I think everybody,

3425
02:43:01,831 --> 02:43:06,831
should I wait to one degree or another 
in powershell it's hard because most 

3426
02:43:06,831 --> 02:43:09,801
people don't have the space,
the situation to the weight in their 

3427
02:43:09,801 --> 02:43:13,281
backyard.
But figuring out ways on the cheap to 

3428
02:43:13,281 --> 02:43:17,400
make that up and figure out ways on an 
architectural standpoint on it,

3429
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:21,790
multiple ways to try to make the link 
between people and eating food,

3430
02:43:21,791 --> 02:43:26,791
the direct ones so that people have a 
sense of where food comes from and that 

3431
02:43:26,791 --> 02:43:27,940
they raise their own food to one degree 
or another.

3432
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:33,570
I think that would be awesome.
I don't know how realistic that these 

3433
02:43:33,570 --> 02:43:36,061
are our practical,
but why not take a few steps in that 

3434
02:43:36,061 --> 02:43:36,070
direction.
Figure out how we can be done.

3435
02:43:36,210 --> 02:43:41,210
Yeah.
I mean everyone who has a backyard 

3436
02:43:41,210 --> 02:43:41,210
should have a garden.
Yeah.

3437
02:43:41,210 --> 02:43:45,570
It's not that difficult to grow 
something and just even if you only grow

3438
02:43:45,571 --> 02:43:48,600
a meal a month,
just a salad,

3439
02:43:48,700 --> 02:43:53,700
just something.
It's something particularly satisfying 

3440
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:54,840
about picking a cucumber that you grew.
Chopping it up,

3441
02:43:54,841 --> 02:43:58,090
putting in a sal,
cooking a squash that you grew this.

3442
02:43:58,130 --> 02:43:59,850
It's.
It's really nice.

3443
02:44:00,090 --> 02:44:01,680
It's.
And I think it's primal.

3444
02:44:01,681 --> 02:44:06,681
I think it,
it connects us in some sort of a way to 

3445
02:44:06,681 --> 02:44:06,681
shade it a lot more.

3446
02:44:07,110 --> 02:44:10,670
You remember all the time and energy 
that went into getting this stuff

3447
02:44:10,670 --> 02:44:12,590
from these big two.
Then you're like,

3448
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:14,090
ah,
this is a,

3449
02:44:14,091 --> 02:44:17,600
there's a story behind it.
My friend remy warren was on the podcast

3450
02:44:17,601 --> 02:44:22,601
yesterday and he has a show on the 
outdoor channel called a apex predator 

3451
02:44:23,210 --> 02:44:28,210
and it's all about he follows these 
different animals and tries to learn how

3452
02:44:29,631 --> 02:44:34,631
they hunt and how they survive and and 
one of them was about bears and he had 

3453
02:44:35,501 --> 02:44:40,501
to,
he tried to forage the way a bear 

3454
02:44:40,501 --> 02:44:42,170
forages and he was shocked by how little
you could find to eat,

3455
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:47,590
like you know what you're doing.
And we were talking and he was saying,

3456
02:44:47,930 --> 02:44:50,330
you look around at all these plants.
Everywhere we look,

3457
02:44:50,331 --> 02:44:52,520
we see trees,
bushes and garden,

3458
02:44:52,550 --> 02:44:57,550
but none of it you can eat.
Like why do we grow so many plants that 

3459
02:44:57,550 --> 02:45:00,140
we could just grow food everywhere?
And I was like,

3460
02:45:00,170 --> 02:45:01,310
I never even thought about that.

3461
02:45:01,310 --> 02:45:05,900
Like instead of palm trees have food,
trees everywhere.

3462
02:45:05,901 --> 02:45:08,060
Food.
Could you imagine if everyone,

3463
02:45:08,660 --> 02:45:10,700
anywhere you looked,
everywhere you go,

3464
02:45:10,850 --> 02:45:13,730
there was grapes growing and tomatoes 
and,

3465
02:45:13,731 --> 02:45:14,240
and,
and,

3466
02:45:14,300 --> 02:45:17,600
and fucking peaches and shit.
Why not?

3467
02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:20,450
Exactly.
I agree 110 percent.

3468
02:45:20,451 --> 02:45:21,480
With that,
it's like it's we,

3469
02:45:21,770 --> 02:45:26,770
we need to work in that direction.
It gets totally possible if there's all 

3470
02:45:26,770 --> 02:45:27,980
these bushes and trees.
Every,

3471
02:45:28,490 --> 02:45:31,010
every city.
Street has bushes and trees and.

3472
02:45:31,190 --> 02:45:33,400
But none of them are growing food.
It's weird.

3473
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:35,130
Science.
What does it.

3474
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:37,290
And it's not like those,
like an apple trees,

3475
02:45:37,310 --> 02:45:39,330
a beautiful tree.
Like a cherry tree.

3476
02:45:39,331 --> 02:45:41,520
That's a beautiful tree though.
Why don't we do.

3477
02:45:41,570 --> 02:45:43,080
I don't get it.
I don't go to data.

3478
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:49,720
It's strange.
It's like somewhere along the line we 

3479
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:49,720
lost the plot.
Like,

3480
02:45:49,720 --> 02:45:50,420
yeah,
growing a bunch of shit we don't need.

3481
02:45:50,450 --> 02:45:52,780
That seemed like a really smart concept 
is.

3482
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:53,450
Yeah.
That's.

3483
02:45:53,451 --> 02:45:54,530
Hold on.
Yeah.

3484
02:45:54,531 --> 02:45:59,531
It's very strange.
It's very strange that we don't have 

3485
02:45:59,531 --> 02:46:03,041
food around us all the time.
Like we have to rely on it getting 

3486
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:03,041
shipped in and trucks.
Yep.

3487
02:46:03,041 --> 02:46:03,410
Yeah.
I mean seriously,

3488
02:46:03,411 --> 02:46:07,370
like any major american city or math or 
most cities in the lord,

3489
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:12,660
our [inaudible] fire away.
They are one big blackout away from 

3490
02:46:12,660 --> 02:46:14,620
everybody turning into the walking dead.
It's,

3491
02:46:14,680 --> 02:46:18,950
we're seeing things get really ugly 
really quick because noboDy has any idea

3492
02:46:18,951 --> 02:46:21,420
how to get food.
Danielle,

3493
02:46:21,610 --> 02:46:23,420
ebola,
do we have to end on a low note?

3494
02:46:23,610 --> 02:46:24,800
No,
let's piCk up.

3495
02:46:24,910 --> 02:46:26,270
Let's go.
We're almost out of time.

3496
02:46:26,380 --> 02:46:28,070
That's very little time here.
Left.

3497
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,720
What do you got there?
What's the book you got?

3498
02:46:29,810 --> 02:46:30,320
Oh,
this is.

3499
02:46:30,380 --> 02:46:31,470
I'm doing research.
Uh,

3500
02:46:31,550 --> 02:46:36,550
this is a book about caravaggio,
the italian painter I'm doing because I 

3501
02:46:36,550 --> 02:46:38,060
put up here a bunch of research for 
history on fire.

3502
02:46:38,061 --> 02:46:43,061
I prepare a lot of research ahead 
because otherwise with dan carlin ended 

3503
02:46:43,061 --> 02:46:46,271
up doing is that you do need to have 
this humongous gaps between one episode 

3504
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:50,021
and the next to research because he 
takes as doing the math the other day 

3505
02:46:50,021 --> 02:46:53,681
just because I was bored and I figure it
take me to produce a two hour episode 

3506
02:46:53,681 --> 02:46:53,690
for history and fire.

3507
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:58,690
It takes me probably about 200 hours of 
work have shown and research and read 

3508
02:46:58,690 --> 02:47:00,320
the book and take the notes and do this 
and that.

3509
02:47:00,750 --> 02:47:02,060
So,
I mean that's a fulltime job.

3510
02:47:02,061 --> 02:47:04,870
I can release episodes often if,
uh,

3511
02:47:05,050 --> 02:47:10,050
if I'm doing other thIngs.
So what I did is for the last two years 

3512
02:47:10,050 --> 02:47:11,250
I basically prepare to start history on 
fire.

3513
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:14,960
So you knew you were going to do this 
for the last couple of years?

3514
02:47:14,961 --> 02:47:16,950
I've been working at it,
not all the time,

3515
02:47:16,951 --> 02:47:21,951
you know,
while I do another thing and now I can 

3516
02:47:21,951 --> 02:47:24,280
get to bed,
but I basically prepare eight episodes 

3517
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:24,400
so I would have the research ready to 
roll,

3518
02:47:24,750 --> 02:47:28,640
just need to record data and that's it.
So he buys me a little time.

3519
02:47:28,641 --> 02:47:33,641
So I kind of released that these old 76 
weeks now until eventually the research 

3520
02:47:33,681 --> 02:47:36,530
catch up with the ana done carlene 
skylar.

3521
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:41,560
But hopefully I'm.
So now I'm researching episode denying 

3522
02:47:41,560 --> 02:47:42,230
the well I am on steel on episode two is
our,

3523
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:45,500
it's like trying to eventually will 
catch up,

3524
02:47:45,501 --> 02:47:47,900
which they probably won't be that long 
until catch up with me,

3525
02:47:47,901 --> 02:47:52,901
but until then by deleveraging episodes 
on a relatively often scared or I can 

3526
02:47:53,841 --> 02:47:58,841
also hook up more people and by that 
point they may be more forgiving if I 

3527
02:47:58,841 --> 02:48:02,830
take longer to do the research.
But it's such an intensive style of 

3528
02:48:02,830 --> 02:48:04,940
podcasting.
It's really like not just educational,

3529
02:48:04,941 --> 02:48:06,390
but it's like you're,
you're,

3530
02:48:06,470 --> 02:48:09,470
you're kind of doing a lecture.
It's an audio lecture.

3531
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:11,700
Yeah,
I did when I did that too.

3532
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:14,810
I was really happy with episode one.
I thought kicks ass.

3533
02:48:14,811 --> 02:48:19,811
It's good.
It's every single I wanted that I 

3534
02:48:19,811 --> 02:48:19,940
picture in my mind is coming on.
I did episode two,

3535
02:48:19,950 --> 02:48:23,070
I listened to it and I'm like,
this is a b effort.

3536
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:26,780
This is not what I wanted and buy.
I did the whole thing.

3537
02:48:26,781 --> 02:48:28,760
I recorded over a few days.
I'm like,

3538
02:48:28,890 --> 02:48:30,340
no,
come on iT.

3539
02:48:30,410 --> 02:48:31,580
And then I was like,
you know what?

3540
02:48:31,590 --> 02:48:33,990
Fucking delete and start over.
Wow.

3541
02:48:34,220 --> 02:48:35,270
You deleted it.
Yeah.

3542
02:48:35,360 --> 02:48:36,110
That was like,
no,

3543
02:48:36,111 --> 02:48:37,930
I don't,
I don't want to do a specialty.

3544
02:48:37,970 --> 02:48:39,860
Definitely not at the beginning,
but in general,

3545
02:48:39,861 --> 02:48:44,861
you know,
you want to release it and then delete 

3546
02:48:44,861 --> 02:48:44,861
it.
I just recorded it.

3547
02:48:44,861 --> 02:48:45,770
That was,
we're about to put the intro,

3548
02:48:45,771 --> 02:48:47,270
the outro,
that kind of thing.

3549
02:48:47,271 --> 02:48:49,640
And I was listening and I'm like,
no,

3550
02:48:49,641 --> 02:48:52,580
it doesn't have that punch that I want.
And um,

3551
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,840
and so I was like,
no,

3552
02:48:53,841 --> 02:48:57,400
fuck it.
I'll do it on an outline or like,

3553
02:48:57,410 --> 02:48:58,220
how do you.
Yeah,

3554
02:48:58,221 --> 02:49:03,221
it's a fairly detailed outline now you 
don't want to date because of course 

3555
02:49:03,221 --> 02:49:07,331
then it doesn't sound natural,
but you and I have a pretty clear of 

3556
02:49:07,331 --> 02:49:08,970
where we are going and uh,
so if you haven't eaten a quotation that

3557
02:49:08,971 --> 02:49:10,260
you need to call it is right there.

3558
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:12,210
If you,
you know exacTly where it's going.

3559
02:49:12,211 --> 02:49:16,440
So it's same ice cream,
but then you do it where you can.

3560
02:49:16,441 --> 02:49:18,840
It's kind of like if I deliver a lecture
in class,

3561
02:49:19,080 --> 02:49:20,670
I'll take a peek at my notes and like,
oh,

3562
02:49:20,671 --> 02:49:25,671
that's what I need to go next.
But then you deliver it in a more 

3563
02:49:25,671 --> 02:49:28,431
natural style.
And so that's a good chunk of notes.

3564
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:30,300
But then of course you don't read the 
notes,

3565
02:49:30,301 --> 02:49:35,301
you just have them there as a to keep 
you on track so that you know where 

3566
02:49:35,301 --> 02:49:37,020
you're going next.
And I'd be really curious to see if your

3567
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:39,000
accent is the same.
By episode nine.

3568
02:49:40,160 --> 02:49:43,170
I honestly duct is going to change 
because again,

3569
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:44,730
if I could direct,
you know,

3570
02:49:44,740 --> 02:49:47,490
actually I got in trouble because I say 
you told your podcast.

3571
02:49:47,491 --> 02:49:49,380
I think the first time I was on your 
podcast,

3572
02:49:49,381 --> 02:49:50,650
that as a joke,
I said,

3573
02:49:50,770 --> 02:49:52,710
you know,
I used to speak perfect english.

3574
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:54,410
I just,
I'm using good for women.

3575
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:56,550
Right.
And people took it seriously.

3576
02:49:56,551 --> 02:49:59,270
They thought that I really like fucking 
pig.

3577
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:00,490
Yeah.
And might affect.

3578
02:50:00,630 --> 02:50:03,120
If I could pull that off,
I will actually would do it because it's

3579
02:50:03,121 --> 02:50:04,490
still.
If I couldn't go that way,

3580
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:06,180
I wouldn't do it,
but he's really just like,

3581
02:50:06,181 --> 02:50:11,181
don't theory.
Well you have a green light to do it 

3582
02:50:11,181 --> 02:50:11,970
because you're italian.
I started to move to Italy and I started

3583
02:50:11,971 --> 02:50:14,430
talking like this.
Then I will be a poser,

3584
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:20,420
poser.
The fact he's also eat would take an 

3585
02:50:20,420 --> 02:50:21,660
insane amount of work to change because 
I don't hear it,

3586
02:50:21,661 --> 02:50:26,661
so I would have to really sit down and 
just spend four over dwayne and that you

3587
02:50:27,600 --> 02:50:32,600
have the most extreme version of a 
completely fluent english language that 

3588
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:37,011
I've ever heard.
Have anthony bourdain's wife is from 

3589
02:50:37,011 --> 02:50:38,970
Italy and she has a very strong italian 
accent,

3590
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:44,000
but she's way clear than you have been 
friends for a long time,

3591
02:50:46,681 --> 02:50:48,360
so I know exactly what you're saying,
what you're saying.

3592
02:50:48,360 --> 02:50:50,700
But if I didn't know you I'd probably be
like,

3593
02:50:50,910 --> 02:50:55,910
what the fuck did he just say that art 
is a flow to it though people have zero 

3594
02:50:59,560 --> 02:51:01,140
problem.
Most people are like,

3595
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:02,840
oh no,
I understand everything you say,

3596
02:51:02,841 --> 02:51:07,841
no problem.
And then there are people who have no 

3597
02:51:07,841 --> 02:51:07,841
idea of what one word I'm saying.
I had the,

3598
02:51:07,900 --> 02:51:10,550
I had a friend and I were talking on the
phone and they're like,

3599
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:13,490
oh,
so I'm going to cook tonight and maxine,

3600
02:51:13,580 --> 02:51:14,630
what?
WhaT do you want to eat?

3601
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:15,250
And I said,
ah,

3602
02:51:15,251 --> 02:51:20,251
I don't know what to say.
I was thinking of making some salomon 

3603
02:51:20,251 --> 02:51:20,251
and they were like,
what?

3604
02:51:20,251 --> 02:51:24,580
Salmaan salmaan sorry,
I.

3605
02:51:25,590 --> 02:51:26,020
Oh,
fish.

3606
02:51:26,090 --> 02:51:26,520
Okay,
great.

3607
02:51:26,521 --> 02:51:28,190
What kind of fish?
Salmaan or like.

3608
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:31,990
Because of course you don't say that's a
moron.

3609
02:51:32,810 --> 02:51:37,810
Put two and two together,
but also might on a salad bar and I'm 

3610
02:51:37,810 --> 02:51:40,260
pronouncing every single ladder.
whereas it english salmon.

3611
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:40,860
Yeah,
exactly.

3612
02:51:40,861 --> 02:51:41,830
Thank you.
That one,

3613
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:43,380
but I can get it.
It's like,

3614
02:51:43,650 --> 02:51:45,380
and no one says sam edelman.
Yeah,

3615
02:51:45,600 --> 02:51:50,600
right.
That's not how you say you were making 

3616
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:52,101
up words.
I spell out every single thing because 

3617
02:51:52,101 --> 02:51:52,650
you need that in every lecture that's 
there.

3618
02:51:52,651 --> 02:51:56,910
It's meant to be pronounced.
So you read every single them let her in

3619
02:51:56,911 --> 02:52:01,911
english.
That's not the case and so that's 

3620
02:52:01,911 --> 02:52:04,370
confusing.
But there's also some weird things like 

3621
02:52:04,370 --> 02:52:04,770
two c's or an h,
two r.

3622
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:06,010
YeAh.
And two

3623
02:52:06,010 --> 02:52:08,650
l's or a walk or thIngs get weird.
Yep.

3624
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:12,140
That's the phonetic differences between 
the way letters like,

3625
02:52:12,490 --> 02:52:17,490
like that's a big issue obviously with 
portuguese to english too with the 

3626
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:21,150
brazilians are the ares or hs and 
everything gets very weird when you try 

3627
02:52:21,150 --> 02:52:25,681
to translate it baCk and forth.
Well that was what I wanted to ask you 

3628
02:52:25,681 --> 02:52:25,681
earlier,
but I,

3629
02:52:25,681 --> 02:52:28,960
I'd actually forgotten when we were 
talking about translating,

3630
02:52:28,961 --> 02:52:33,961
when you're talking about the difference
between learning english and seeing how 

3631
02:52:33,961 --> 02:52:37,060
short and abrupt the sentences are as 
opposed to like the italian.

3632
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:42,040
How difficult is it when they're 
translating ancient historical texts?

3633
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:43,790
It's crazy hard.
Yeah.

3634
02:52:43,791 --> 02:52:46,390
It was crazy.
That's why a lot of translations are,

3635
02:52:46,391 --> 02:52:47,420
it's an art form,
you know,

3636
02:52:47,440 --> 02:52:52,440
some translators are awesome and who 
knows if they are really true to the 

3637
02:52:52,440 --> 02:52:55,780
original language but late do something 
amazing and some don't.

3638
02:52:56,620 --> 02:52:59,320
It's a I love about achieving,
you know,

3639
02:52:59,321 --> 02:53:01,930
when you're ready.
Some translatIons are painful.

3640
02:53:01,931 --> 02:53:04,120
I don't give a fuck.
It's like this is boring as hell.

3641
02:53:04,121 --> 02:53:06,790
I don't know what they are talking about
and you read the next translation is the

3642
02:53:06,791 --> 02:53:09,550
best book I've ever read and he's like,
how can that even be?

3643
02:53:09,680 --> 02:53:13,160
But well there's some sort of an 
artistic license and the trends,

3644
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:18,390
translations,
that's what it is and that's what it 

3645
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:22,110
really kind of has to be taken into 
account when you're talking about any 

3646
02:53:22,110 --> 02:53:22,480
really ancient thing that it's an,
an,

3647
02:53:22,540 --> 02:53:24,220
an,
a language you have to take into account

3648
02:53:24,221 --> 02:53:27,640
the time that they wrote it,
the way people communicated back then.

3649
02:53:27,700 --> 02:53:31,780
Even if you read ancient english stuff 
like the way they talked.

3650
02:53:31,781 --> 02:53:34,090
I mean even just read the declaration of
independence,

3651
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:37,420
the way people describe things and 
communicate.

3652
02:53:37,421 --> 02:53:38,650
It's odd.
It is.

3653
02:53:38,710 --> 02:53:41,640
It's hard to wrap your head around,
you know,

3654
02:53:41,800 --> 02:53:42,930
big time.
Yeah,

3655
02:53:43,020 --> 02:53:48,020
it's a translation from one culture to 
another one time period to another and 

3656
02:53:48,371 --> 02:53:51,910
all of those combined like ancient 
italian literature,

3657
02:53:52,420 --> 02:53:55,270
translating that into modern american 
english.

3658
02:53:55,271 --> 02:53:57,780
It's gotta be like super bizarre.
Yeah.

3659
02:53:57,781 --> 02:54:00,890
You are kind of rewriting it.
It's a.

3660
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:05,150
It's a cooperation between the writer 
and the translator and it's a.

3661
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:10,740
That's why when I don't are lots of 
books that I read in italian because my 

3662
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:13,891
english stock and I couldn't read it 
read in english and when I finally got 

3663
02:54:13,891 --> 02:54:13,891
through to them in english,
I'm like,

3664
02:54:13,891 --> 02:54:17,850
well,
that's another book that's completely 

3665
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:17,850
different.
There are some similarities,

3666
02:54:17,850 --> 02:54:20,680
but it's a whole different style.
There's not even close.

3667
02:54:21,070 --> 02:54:22,540
Yeah,
I would think that would be the case.

3668
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:25,000
Absolutely.
With the bible,

3669
02:54:25,110 --> 02:54:27,190
they'll like to really understand the 
bible.

3670
02:54:27,191 --> 02:54:30,750
You hAve to truly understand like 
whatever translation.

3671
02:54:30,750 --> 02:54:31,800
Again,
like aramaic,

3672
02:54:31,820 --> 02:54:34,360
you'd have to like truly understand 
ancient hebrew,

3673
02:54:34,970 --> 02:54:37,300
but ancient hebrew is like a real 
squirrely language anyway.

3674
02:54:37,301 --> 02:54:40,030
Right?
Somebody pixi pick secondly the way.

3675
02:54:40,031 --> 02:54:43,270
Well as a sweet kind of.
There's a lot of guesswork.

3676
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:44,150
Of course.
Well,

3677
02:54:44,151 --> 02:54:46,390
this one of the weirdest ones because 
it's also a number.

3678
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:50,350
It's a numerical language,
like the literature is the number one,

3679
02:54:50,351 --> 02:54:53,650
they don't have numbers or letters 
served as numbers as well,

3680
02:54:53,651 --> 02:54:58,651
so it's like words had numerical value,
good luck that I was laying in bed and 

3681
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:04,350
there's a bunch of words today,
lIke there's a debate about what 

3682
02:55:04,350 --> 02:55:04,490
percentage are still

3683
02:55:04,820 --> 02:55:06,980
under debate,
right?

3684
02:55:06,981 --> 02:55:11,981
And so like what,
what it actually means and what it 

3685
02:55:11,981 --> 02:55:13,841
doesn't mean,
but imagine if you could learn ancient 

3686
02:55:13,841 --> 02:55:17,750
hebrew like exactly how they did it.
Then you would understand what they were

3687
02:55:17,751 --> 02:55:20,300
trying to say,
but even then you wouldn't understand it

3688
02:55:20,301 --> 02:55:24,890
unless you were in the context of the 
culture that existed when acute.

3689
02:55:24,891 --> 02:55:27,350
You had to know how they thought about 
things.

3690
02:55:27,351 --> 02:55:30,680
Exactly.
That's why most of the time you have to.

3691
02:55:30,770 --> 02:55:35,770
You don't really know what that guy said
to you are these translational sound 

3692
02:55:35,770 --> 02:55:36,500
bath or.
So I'll go with that one,

3693
02:55:36,501 --> 02:55:38,090
but you know,
know which one they meant.

3694
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:43,420
Well,
it's got to be one of the really most 

3695
02:55:43,420 --> 02:55:44,981
difficult.
one of the most difficult aspects about 

3696
02:55:44,981 --> 02:55:46,961
history too,
because it was written by people who 

3697
02:55:46,961 --> 02:55:49,751
decided how they wanted people to 
remember the turn of events and exactly 

3698
02:55:49,751 --> 02:55:52,190
whether or not that's exactly how it 
went down.

3699
02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:57,370
There are cases where there's like the 
egyptian guy who left the record of 

3700
02:55:57,370 --> 02:55:57,370
like,
oh,

3701
02:55:57,370 --> 02:56:01,481
we meet,
we've met the hittites and were kicking 

3702
02:56:01,481 --> 02:56:02,780
her ass if we wipe them out and the 
pharaoh is the best that the jewelry,

3703
02:56:02,781 --> 02:56:05,120
the hittite accountant that does not 
look like,

3704
02:56:08,290 --> 02:56:13,290
how do you,
how do you know what the fuck really 

3705
02:56:13,290 --> 02:56:15,401
happened?
And we will have this vague sense of 

3706
02:56:15,401 --> 02:56:15,540
what happened.
We know like facts,

3707
02:56:15,550 --> 02:56:18,230
like these people aren't around anymore.
It's just so somebody killed them,

3708
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:23,700
you know?
Well we found this pile of bones and 

3709
02:56:23,700 --> 02:56:25,340
this is where we think we found troy 
because this is a spot like,

3710
02:56:25,550 --> 02:56:30,550
fuck man,
there's a ton off guesswork involved in 

3711
02:56:30,550 --> 02:56:30,550
history.
You know,

3712
02:56:30,550 --> 02:56:32,480
we make it sound like it's this super 
hard science and you know,

3713
02:56:32,481 --> 02:56:34,340
you want to be as scientific as 
possible,

3714
02:56:34,341 --> 02:56:36,530
but there's a lot of guesswork at the 
end of the day.

3715
02:56:36,950 --> 02:56:40,460
That's so weird.
It's so weird that we're trying to piece

3716
02:56:40,461 --> 02:56:43,460
together the past to understand how we 
got here.

3717
02:56:43,700 --> 02:56:46,310
Almost like a giant crime scene of the 
world.

3718
02:56:46,311 --> 02:56:51,311
yep.
We're slowly like brushing fingerprint 

3719
02:56:51,311 --> 02:56:54,611
dust on things and trying to figure out 
where the fucking blood splattered from 

3720
02:56:54,611 --> 02:56:57,290
and what happened,
what the fuck happened,

3721
02:56:57,620 --> 02:57:00,200
and then you have to go over some shit 
that people wrote down.

3722
02:57:00,201 --> 02:57:01,670
Don't even know what the hell they were 
saying.

3723
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:07,340
Get a bunch of scholars.
there's one episode I want to do next 

3724
02:57:07,340 --> 02:57:10,560
that's.
There's no primary sources is all a 

3725
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:13,300
archeology and he's these guy.
I don't know if you'd remember to start 

3726
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:13,300
at guided.
They found the ball deep,

3727
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:15,990
perfectly preserved for 5,000
years ago at the ice.

3728
02:57:16,230 --> 02:57:18,620
Yeah.
let's see what's.

3729
02:57:18,900 --> 02:57:23,900
Yeah,
it's an awesome story because through 

3730
02:57:23,900 --> 02:57:26,771
archaeology you find out so much.
You can find out what this guy was 

3731
02:57:26,771 --> 02:57:26,990
eating 5,000
years ago,

3732
02:57:26,991 --> 02:57:31,991
what the of this stuff and yet 
ultimately you don't know who the hell 

3733
02:57:31,991 --> 02:57:31,991
he was,
but there's.

3734
02:57:31,991 --> 02:57:36,340
It's a nice steady enough to tease you,
but just not enough to actually know all

3735
02:57:37,341 --> 02:57:38,510
is up.
Yeah.

3736
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:43,540
It's.
It's amazing though that you can find 

3737
02:57:43,540 --> 02:57:45,941
something like that preserved.
At least get like a short window into 

3738
02:57:45,941 --> 02:57:49,691
that time.
Jamie just gave me the two minute mark 

3739
02:57:49,691 --> 02:57:49,940
so we got a rabbi's up.
It's a old baby.

3740
02:57:50,150 --> 02:57:51,500
We just did it three hours.
My friend.

3741
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:53,270
He's so much fun.
Flew by,

3742
02:57:53,330 --> 02:57:56,750
flew by love.
If every time a history on fire,

3743
02:57:56,840 --> 02:57:59,330
two episodes are available and episode 
zero as well.

3744
02:57:59,331 --> 02:58:04,331
Right?
Like a little pilot or let everybody 

3745
02:58:04,331 --> 02:58:04,331
know what's

3746
02:58:04,331 --> 02:58:04,331
up.
And uh,

3747
02:58:04,331 --> 02:58:06,510
anything else?
Got a book coming out next moment.

3748
02:58:06,630 --> 02:58:09,250
So early december.
I have a,

3749
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:11,190
uh,
people can,

3750
02:58:11,191 --> 02:58:13,790
if they are interested in and we'll 
tweet about it,

3751
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:18,800
we'll let everybody know and a hobby 
back in once the book's out to my 

3752
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:18,800
brother.
Thank you so much.

3753
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:19,680
Thank you.
All right,

3754
02:58:19,681 --> 02:58:21,210
my friends.
That's it for this week.

3755
02:58:21,211 --> 02:58:22,920
We'll be back next week.
Until then.

3756
02:58:22,921 --> 02:58:23,700
See you soon.
Bye.

3757
02:58:23,701 --> 02:58:23,910
Bye.
