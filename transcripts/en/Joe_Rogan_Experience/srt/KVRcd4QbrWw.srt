00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey everybody,
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:11,091
is brought to you by squarespace.
Squarespace is a website that allows you

3
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:15,300
to make your own website a professional 
website easily,

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,950
quickly,
simply,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,500
and you don't even have to pay for it to
try it.

6
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:24,240
If you go to squarespace.com,
forward slash joe or squarespace.com,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,470
use the,
uh,

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,800
the end of the Codeword Joe to save 10 
percent off your first purchase.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,940
If you go there,
you can go try out the service,

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,210
build your own website,
and then if you decide you like it,

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,480
then add credit card information.
They do that because they're very 

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:41,480
confident in what they're making.
It's a,

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,680
it's an excellent way to build a 
website.

14
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:48,681
You could build killer websites on your 
own with real simple drag and drop 

15
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:54,111
interface.
They offer 24 slash seven support and 

16
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:56,130
they've also launched a logo creator.
You can create a clean,

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,370
simple,
custom logo designed for yourself in 

18
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:01,370
minutes.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,700
If you want to check that out.
Go to squarespace.com,

20
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,910
forward slash logo.
They've also launched a new website that

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:13,401
will deliver better customer experience.
They have it set up so that you can 

22
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:18,150
easily start your own store online.
If you are a musician,

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,240
you can sell digital music.
If you're a comedian,

24
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:26,241
you can sell digital music.
If you're a guy who's so fucking 

25
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,630
interesting that you can talk and people
want to hear you talk,

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,610
you could sell that shit too.
I don't,

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,950
I don't recommend it.
Most people are not going to buy it,

28
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,950
but if you do have it,
squarespace can provide it.

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,640
That's an awesome way for a Milan like 
you or me to make their own website 

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,380
easily.
This is a very unique time because there

31
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,180
really was nothing like this in the 
past.

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,610
Used to have to use programs and it was 
a pain in the ass to learn.

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,990
You have to really dedicate yourself.
So much so that I'd never even attempted

34
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:56,991
to design my own website,
but I would absolutely make my own 

35
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:56,991
website.
With squarespace,

36
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,320
it's easy.
You can use your own images.

37
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,960
You could set it up in a variety of 
different ways.

38
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,330
There's several different patterns and 
um,

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,640
I've met the people that run it and 
they're fucking cool.

40
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,340
So go there,

44
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:25,500
That's o n n I t a human optimization 
website.

45
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,180
We're going to have to get some on it to
chrome.

46
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,210
Gracie because he's here and he wants to
get on it.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,600
What do we have it on it?
We have all sorts of nutritional 

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,290
products,
things like earth grown nutrients,

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,510
which is a blend of superfoods,
antioxidants,

50
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,430
Greens,
like wheat grass,

51
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,830

all sorts of different healthy Greens,
fill of micronutrients that you might 

54
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,511
not get in your everyday diet that you 
can add to your diet,

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,650
which can help you.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,580
You just balance out your nutrition.
You know,

57
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,581
people are busy.
It's hard to eat totally and completely 

58
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:05,581
healthy all the time.
Uh,

59
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:09,600
we want to provide you at,
on it with all the keys and all the 

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,621
tools for you to function at your best,
whether it's nutritional supplements or 

61
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:15,570
whether it's strength and conditioning 
equipment like kettlebells,

62
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,500
battle ropes,
a weight vest,

63
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,760
steel,
maces,

64
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,230
ab wheels,
all that shit.

65
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,330
We have the excellent kettlebell cardio 
extreme workout videos by Keith Weber.

66
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:27,820
We sell those.
We sell defense soap,

67
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:32,821
which is very important if you're into 
Jujitsu or wrestling or anything when 

68
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:38,011
your,
your skin comes in contact with funk 

69
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:38,011
defense soap,
uh,

70
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,660
allows your body to maintain its healthy
flora,

71
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,250
but a washes off all the bad bacteria.
And it's made by my friend,

72
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:50,251
Guy Soco who's a cool dude and a big 
supporter of wrestling guy actually just

73
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:56,071
sent me an email today.
So I want to wish his son well because 

74
00:03:56,071 --> 00:04:00,481
his son is competing in the NCAA 
wrestling championships at a 145 pounds.

75
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,800
So Gus,
good luck.

76
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,340
Gus Soco.
Alright.

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,570
percent on any and all

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,540
We're here with chrome,
gracie and we're going to get popping

80
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:19,770
experience

81
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:25,990
podcast.
So a few years back,

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,730
my friend Gordon has to,

83
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,020
who's a,
a guy that I met on the Internet,

84
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,640
said,
Hey,

85
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,370
do you want to have dinner with Hixon 
Gracie?

86
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,280
So I said,
fuck yeah man,

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,160
if you are a Jujitsu practitioner,
um,

88
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,000
there's,
it's very rare in a sport.

89
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,810
I guess there's a few sports,
like if you think bike racing,

90
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:51,700
you think,
you think Lance Armstrong,

91
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,160
unfortunately now,
but that's the name,

92
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,350
but the universal name that gets thrown 
about in Jujitsu,

93
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,600
there's the last name,
which is gracie.

94
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,790
And then once you get to know Jujitsu 
and you understand Jujitsu and you get,

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,970
you start training,
everybody always wants to know who's the

96
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,080
best,
who's the best,

97
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,110
who's the best universally regarded as 
the all time best is your father,

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
your father,
Hicks,

99
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:23,241
and Gracie.
This is not much debate amongst Jujitsu 

100
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,310
people.
There's debate as to who's the best 

101
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,621
right now.
But I talked to Henzel about this one 

102
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:32,191
time and uh,
and Enzo just shook his head and he 

103
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:32,380
goes,
he's a motherfucker.

104
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,150
It goes,
he's a motherfucker.

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,310
His is laughing.
It's like he's the best.

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,340
He's the best.
And when a guy like henslow's says 

107
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:41,340
something,
I just listened,

108
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,480
you know,
so what is it?

109
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,890
That's when I met you,
you're,

110
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,490
you were with your dad.
And we went and had some dinner and then

111
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,130
we went back to your house and we 
watched some fights,

112
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,810
which was amazing to have your dad break
down what,

113
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,210
what guys are doing wrong and what's 
wrong with their positioning,

114
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,050
what's wrong with their approach and 
what his approach is.

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,440
And for me as a student of martial arts 
and as a fan of martial arts,

116
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,980
it was a huge honor,
you know,

117
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,230
and you were like 16 or 17 back then.
Yeah.

118
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,290
Something like that that you were into 
rap music and all kinds of different 

119
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,230
shit.
And so from that,

120
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,890
um,
you know,

121
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,680
I've,
I've run into a few times over the years

122
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:29,681
when,
when hoists fought Matt Hughes and a 

123
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,130
couple other times you've become 
yourself,

124
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,360
like one of the most prominent Jujitsu 
fighters in the world today.

125
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,940
Um,
and that's so cool to see.

126
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,180
It's so cool to see a young kid with 
aspirations and then put in the work.

127
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,840
And it's also cool to see the son of a 
great man become a great man himself,

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,900
which is very difficult and it doesn't 
really happen that often.

129
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,490
You know,
a lot of times the sign of a great man 

130
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,080
lives in the shadow of his father and 
sort of fall short.

131
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,330
But,
uh,

132
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,740
you and your young life,
you're 25 now,

133
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,830
25 and your young life,
you've already carved out a great name 

134
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,280
in Jujitsu with your own 
accomplishments.

135
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,840
You're widely considered to be amongst 
the very best in the world at Jujitsu.

136
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,610
And how does that feel?

137
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,530
It feels great,
you know,

138
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,770
now finally,
after so long of,

139
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,880
you know,
because I knew when I was a little kid 

140
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,940
that I was going to have to be a fighter
or be a martial artist and have to,

141
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:35,020
you have to really be as much as my dad 
wants to make it feel like he didn't put

142
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:36,120
pressure on me.
And,

143
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,100
and you know,
he did.

144
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:41,120
You know,
people say he teaches invisible Jujitsu.

145
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,440
Well,
I'll talk about invisible pressure,

146
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,470
you know,
like,

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,150
yeah,
like at an early age when first when I'm

148
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,650
a little kid,
I can kind of always see,

149
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,440
you know,
how much my dad trains and how much he,

150
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:01,670
how big he is a part of what he does in 
the world and how much people respect 

151
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,170
him and how much recognition you get.
So from a very early age,

152
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:09,171
you know,
you want to replicate that and you want 

153
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:09,171
to do,
you know,

154
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:10,980
what your father does if it feels like 
cool to you.

155
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,100
And it's always been really cool to me.
Of course when I was a younger up until 

156
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,030
like 12 years old,
I used to skate a lot in Jujitsu is kind

157
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:23,031
of whatever.
But I knew that in the future that that 

158
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:23,130
was what I was going to have to do no 
matter what.

159
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,810
So,
you know,

160
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,910
it came to a point where I kind of put 
skateboarding aside and uh,

161
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,230
I had gotten hurt skateboarding a bunch 
of times and I was like,

162
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,780
you know what,
I don't,

163
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,020
I don't care about skateboarding as much
as I do Jujitsu.

164
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm not going to be as good as a 
skateboarder as I can be with to which 

165
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,340
this kind of all clicked for me a one 
day with my brother,

166
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:44,850
you know,
we,

167
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,870
we were talking and everything and this 
was like one of the last conversations 

168
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,700
we had and,
and he was always like,

169
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,560
you know,
you could,

170
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,470
whatever you do in life,
you do it one percent,

171
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:55,920
you know,
you,

172
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,750
you,
you do it the best you can do it.

173
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,980
You know,
if you're going to be a dentist,

174
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,810
you'd be the best dentist.
If you can be a skateboarder,

175
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:04,170
you'd be the best skateboarder.
But the only difference is right here,

176
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,310
you have an opportunity to do Jujitsu 
and you have the best road.

177
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,260
You have the best dad.
As a coach.

178
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:14,730
You have the best at all,
the tools you need to really be the best

179
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:19,731
you can be.
And it would be stupid for you not to 

180
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:20,790
really take advantage of this.
And that kind of happened when I was 12.

181
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,791
And um,
after my brother passed I kind of 

182
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:29,331
really,
really put effort into that and I kind 

183
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,511
of really made it my mission to make him
proud and to make my dad proud and I 

184
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,771
kind of knew what I had in my hands and,
but at that age you never know how good 

185
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:37,620
you're going to get and you never know 
what's gonna happen.

186
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,860
So I just kind of dedicated myself,
dedicated myself.

187
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:41,930
And then,
you know,

188
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,890
when,
when we met each other I was still fully

189
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:47,780
dedicated but I still hadn't achieved,
um,

190
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,280
you know,
anything really.

191
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,360
And I think like with the,
with,

192
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,060
for me,
like in life when you,

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,100
when you,
when you,

194
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,300
when you try,
when you try,

195
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:05,301
when you try,
when you try is you only get what you 

196
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:05,301
think you're going to get way later.
You know,

197
00:10:05,301 --> 00:10:08,100
like I put so much dedication into it by
16 years old.

198
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:11,640
But I hadn't seen any of the,
of the fruits and I hadn't seen any,

199
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,020
any necessarily like big reward from it,
you know.

200
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,050
So it was basically just the passion of 
being able to train Jujitsu and being 

201
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,600
able to,
to do what I knew was my mission.

202
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,170
And

203
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,040
um,

204
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,100
I kind of lost my track a little bit of 
what I was going to say,

205
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:29,730
but,
uh,

206
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,390
so basically from,
from that age,

207
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,830
you know,
it was,

208
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,840
it was,
it was always like I knew that I had to 

209
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:39,840
do that,
you know,

210
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,100
as much as,
as much as things would always.

211
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,130
Like there's always little things that 
go in your head that you might want to 

212
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,451
like change your or whatever.
But in my mind it was never an option 

213
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,920
not to,
to do Jujitsu and never an option not to

214
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:52,920
be the best I can be and to be the best 
in the world.

215
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:54,630
That was always like where I was going 
to be.

216
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,490
I never had a plan b.
I never had a,

217
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,740
Oh,
I was just going to try this and then if

218
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,930
this doesn't work out,
I'd never had that from you.

219
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:03,660
As always,
this was where I put my energy.

220
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,640
And so I kind of just put my energy into
it.

221
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,930
And um,
you know,

222
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,750
from a very early age,
from 12,

223
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:10,770
13,
14,

224
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,580
everybody knew me as crone Hixson Hixson
zone or you're hitting.

225
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,440
So I already kind of hated that.
I hated being called Hixon son.

226
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:24,441
I hate it being called Hawkins over.
I hated being called somebody that I 

227
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:24,441
wasn't,
you know,

228
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:26,190
and like being recognized for something 
that I didn't do somebody other than who

229
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:26,910
you are.
Yeah.

230
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,940
So I kind of always knew that if I 
wanted to to climb out of this name and 

231
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,420
climb out of the shadow,
I would have to work twice as hard.

232
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:38,421
And it was,
it was going to be a real obstacle for 

233
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:38,640
me to get past this.
And that's what I,

234
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,430
in my mind,
that was my ending goal no matter what I

235
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:46,431
want it to be my own man.
I wanted to be able to represent myself 

236
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:50,691
and my family and everything and I 
wanted to be able to be remembered as 

237
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:53,160
somebody who kept it going,
kept the legacy going.

238
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,880
For folks who don't have any experience 
in martial arts,

239
00:11:56,881 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll try to explain this to people.
There's,

240
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,230
when you really stop and think about the
history of martial arts,

241
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
there's the most important moment,
in my opinion of modern martial arts was

242
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,000
hoists gracie entering into the UFC in 
1993 when hoists gracie entered into the

243
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:20,001
UFC,
we saw for the first time in a real 

244
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,300
application,
we saw what we had always wanted to see 

245
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,601
in the movies.
A smaller man with technique defeating 

246
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:27,600
larger men,
a smaller man.

247
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:32,601
You're utilizing leverage in utilizing 
his skills to defeat everybody in front 

248
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:38,571
of them.
And from that we got introduced to the 

249
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:40,530
name Gracie.
We got introduced to your father.

250
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,620
We got introduced to Leo,
your grandfather,

251
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,010
who was the most important figure in all
of martial arts.

252
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,500
For folks who don't know martial arts 
for the longest time,

253
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,280
for thousands of years,
there was all this debate about what was

254
00:12:56,281 --> 00:13:01,281
the best style,
whether it was a karate or whether it 

255
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:01,281
was Kung Fu.

256
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,750
There was all these different people 
that swore that their master could 

257
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,360
defeat a thousand men and unarmed 
combat.

258
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,690
No one knew what the real deal was until
the UFC came along and that was when the

259
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:18,651
world got introduced to the name Gracie.
What is it like growing up in that 

260
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:24,291
environment and when did you realize 
that your family was different than 

261
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:25,050
everybody else?
I mean,

262
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,210
you come from the most important family 
in the history of martial arts.

263
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,120
Martial arts is what every man wants to 
be able to do.

264
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,860
Every man wants to be able to find 
himself.

265
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,760
Every man wants to be able to kick ass.
The most important family,

266
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,830
in my opinion,
is the Gracie family.

267
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,910
There's no comparison.

268
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,100
Yeah,
I mean you don't really,

269
00:13:46,101 --> 00:13:48,560
you don't really think about it like 
that when you're in the gracie family,

270
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:53,561
you kind of just born into this thing 
where it's all about martial arts and 

271
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:56,180
it's all about dedication and discipline
and you come from,

272
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,110
you know,
tradition.

273
00:13:57,111 --> 00:14:00,500
So you don't really think about from the
outside point of view.

274
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:05,501
You know,
for me it's just been a very normal 

275
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,571
thing to train Jujitsu in the living 
room to talk about how to defend 

276
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:08,120
yourself,
to talk about,

277
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,950
you know,
the average and health and all this.

278
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:13,410
This is just very normal for me.
It was never knew.

279
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,040
He seen somebody get in a fight.
It's more interesting than it is.

280
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,940
Like Oh,
a shock.

281
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:20,680
So it's never been nothing big.
But you know,

282
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:25,960
the older I get the more I kind of 
realized how big what I'm a part of and 

283
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,041
how important it is and that only 
motivates me more to really step up and 

284
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,920
be able to keep this going because,
you know,

285
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,600
my grandfather was a,
was a crazy dude,

286
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,610
you know,
he would challenge anybody and his goal 

287
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,641
was to represent just to,
and to prove g two is the best and that 

288
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,930
guy weighed 135 pounds and he was not a 
physically fit dude.

289
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,930
And you know,
it goes to show how powerful his spirit 

290
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:49,930
was.
And,

291
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,510
and what he did,
he changed the world.

292
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:51,100
You know,
he,

293
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,140
he made it so that a weak person could 
defeat a bigger opponent and you know,

294
00:14:56,331 --> 00:15:01,331
with my dad,
with him leading everything and taking 

295
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:02,360
charge and trying to spread,
you know,

296
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:07,361
he was a very,
very important person in all of our 

297
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:07,361
lives.
You know,

298
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:08,900
he made it possible for,
for a weak person to be able to defeat a

299
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,440
bigger opponent to,
you know,

300
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
have the self confidence to believe in 
something other than physical form.

301
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:17,860
You have to believe in the leverage.
And,

302
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,570
and he,
you know,

303
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:22,220
he,
his theory and his,

304
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,270
what he put onto his children is what 
gave not only the leverage and the 

305
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:33,101
technique,
but also put physical abilities on top 

306
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:35,471
of it.
So my dad got all the theory of the 

307
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:35,471
leverage and being a weak person and how
to survive if you're weaker.

308
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,310
But my dad wasn't.
He wasn't weak.

309
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,520
He was strong.
So he used the technique and the 

310
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:42,980
leverage and the strength on top of it,
which created a monster.

311
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:43,820
You know,
he created,

312
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,570
you know,
somebody who is physically strong but 

313
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,001
trains like as if he was a very 
lightweight of not a physically strong 

314
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:56,261
person.
So he's able to really maximize his 

315
00:15:56,261 --> 00:15:58,040
potential and me coming up into this,
you know,

316
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,370
again,
like it's always just been a fun thing 

317
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,590
and something to be a part of and it 
only kind of really clicked that,

318
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,520
that,
you know,

319
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:10,100
the older you get,
the more we realize how part of it.

320
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:14,450
And sometimes I kind of look outside of 
myself and I kind of take,

321
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:15,180
man,
I'm in a,

322
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,420
this is crazy,
you know,

323
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,360
this is like a movie,
you know,

324
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:21,500
like my grandfather was this legend and 
my dad is this legend.

325
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:22,910
And,
and you know,

326
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,370
like I'm the only son and,
and you know,

327
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:26,730
it's like a movie,
like an hour.

328
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,750
Not only am I the only son,
but I'm also being able to be able to 

329
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,700
prove that I did still in the genes and 
it's still a powerful thing that we're 

330
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,520
dealing with.
So I,

331
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,230
I,
I'm overwhelmed sometimes.

332
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,120
I kind of looked back and I very 
grateful for the situation and obviously

333
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:49,121
God put,
put me in this situation and put us in 

334
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:49,121
the situation for a reason.

335
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,940
Now I'm most recently you won the 
Abudabi submission championships,

336
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,420
which in the world of grappling is the 
most prestigious Nogi submission title 

337
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,800
in the world.
And for folks no gooey,

338
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:07,220
there's two different types of Jujitsu,
Jujitsu with the Kimono,

339
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,660
you know,
the,

340
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,590
it looks like a judo uniform,
that's the g,

341
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:15,770
and then there's Jujitsu with no gate,
which is a much like wrestling or the 

342
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:20,991
type of techniques that you would see in
the UFC because they're not grabbing 

343
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:21,900
clothes very different,
very different.

344
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:22,970
And as far as,
uh,

345
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,390
the,
the pace of things,

346
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,210
but Abu Dhabi's the,
this,

347
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,990
the most prestigious championship in the
world.

348
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,160
So you accomplished like you hit the top
of the mountain,

349
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,210
you know,
you,

350
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:38,211
uh,
you became much like the others in the 

351
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:38,520
Gracie family before you became a 
champion.

352
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,140
What,
what was that feeling like?

353
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,070
It's a great feeling,
you know,

354
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,020
it's just no complaints about that.
Um,

355
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,750
and you know,
I think this,

356
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,940
in my perfect world,
in my dream,

357
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:53,130
if you would've asked me if I would have
wanted the Abu Dhabi,

358
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:58,131
I would have said,
of course I would have wanted it 

359
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:00,771
probably much more times by this age if 
you would ask me when I was 15 years 

360
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:01,620
old.
But,

361
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,420
you know,
in life it's not so easy,

362
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:03,990
you know.
And,

363
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,980
and for me in my life,
everything was easy,

364
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,930
you know,
purple belt was easy,

365
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:14,931
Brown belt was easy,
so I never had had this obstacle of 

366
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,620
challenges and I never really had to dig
deep and figure out what,

367
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,240
what,
what is,

368
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,380
what am I about really?
So my first one,

369
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,810
everything was undefeated as a purple 
and brown belt.

370
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:26,880
And then my first match has a black 
belt.

371
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,270
I lost,
I got my ass whooped and it was a mix of

372
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,060
a bunch of things that I came to my 
conclusion of why that happened.

373
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,170
But in the end I think that I was just 
not mentally ready for that.

374
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,720
And I let all these outside things 
affect me.

375
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:44,721
And anyways,
I lost the fight and really dug deep to 

376
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:45,180
see what I was going to do with my life 
and,

377
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,390
and you know,
after you,

378
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,690
you realize what happens and how you can
prevent it and how you going to get 

379
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,861
better.
Then you start to really work hard for 

380
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:57,861
what you want to get in.
And I,

381
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:02,690
after that moment I kind of started to 
really become a man and really 

382
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:02,850
understand sacrifice and how to work 
hard.

383
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,851
And if you want something in life,
you can't depend on anybody for it and 

384
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:12,440
you can't ask anybody for it.
You have to go in and really work hard 

385
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,350
to get it in.
And that I think I started to really 

386
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,530
become a man as a black belt.

387
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,690
And that's when I really put my energy 
into it.

388
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,220
And you know,
I've,

389
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I've lost tournaments,
I've won lots of tournaments and 

390
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,750
sometimes I lose because of points.
And I,

391
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,660
I've never really been about points.
But,

392
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,530
um,
ultimately I feel like now after so long

393
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:34,950
of being on this journey of this hard 
path,

394
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,280
I finally kind of started to find myself
in the past couple of years and I'm 

395
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,180
finally getting a,
getting the results that I've,

396
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,380
I've wanted a long time ago and I 
realized a lot more about life and about

397
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:49,320
myself then then if I would have just 
won everything.

398
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,190
So that's a great situation to be in.
And um,

399
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,140
I work really hard for this first place,
a metal.

400
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,180
So it's gonna be hard for somebody to 
take it from me.

401
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,930
That is an interesting thing,
isn't it?

402
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:03,931
That you need defeat in order to really 
inspire you to the greatness inside of 

403
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:08,131
you.
You need to feel adversity to rise to 

404
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:10,171
the occasion.
Of course you fought was Sergio Moron 

405
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:13,870
who's a very,
very good black belt and he's fighting 

406
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,280
in the UFC now,
one of the best Jujitsu guys in the UFC.

407
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,710
Really fantastic technique.
That's a,

408
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,000
that's a guy that you're connected to 
forever now because of that,

409
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,120
I thank

410
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,120
him in my mind.
I think I'm a lot and I got promoted 

411
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,280
like two weeks before the world 
championships and my dad's always like,

412
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,300
life is about surprises in about 
challenges and he's like,

413
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
you want this black belt?
And I was,

414
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,990
had submitted 55 straight and like,
yeah,

415
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:41,210
I want this challenge.
Let's see.

416
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,260
The little did I know it was going to 
fucking shake my world and um,

417
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,670
but I,
I'm grateful for and it's great,

418
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,390
you know,
I have no,

419
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:52,930
no complaints in our and I wouldn't have
changed anything.

420
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,530
What is it like growing up being in 
your,

421
00:20:56,531 --> 00:21:01,531
you're going into this world of martial 
arts with a guy like that as your 

422
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:03,030
father.
Like what kind of advice did he

423
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,400
best advice?
I mean that's,

424
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,520
I think that's what made me who I am and
be able to really become my own man at 

425
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,840
this age is the advice that my dad gave 
me was such a,

426
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,890
you know,
it's easy in life to be drifted by 

427
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,260
things and to be drifted by what people 
say and what you personally think and 

428
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,070
say and feel.
So,

429
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,720
you know,
always been able to have.

430
00:21:24,721 --> 00:21:29,721
My Dad gave me a good advice and be able
to be my father and to teach me how to 

431
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,010
be a man,
not just Jujitsu,

432
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,660
not just being good at technique,
but being able to be a good person,

433
00:21:33,661 --> 00:21:37,650
being humble and being,
doing the best that you can.

434
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,030
Um,
I think that's what,

435
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,660
what allows me to become great at 
Jujitsu and what allows me to become 

436
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,900
great at whatever I do.
And you know,

437
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:50,901
for me,
I never really had that much training 

438
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:50,901
sessions with my father.

439
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:54,140
People think he was there coaching me 
everyday training on the sidelines with 

440
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,590
water bottles and all this shit that 
never existed in.

441
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,370
But one thing I do is I am very grateful
for is when I started to train really 

442
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:07,281
hard at like 12 years old.
My Dad was in training at the academy 

443
00:22:07,281 --> 00:22:10,620
and my brother had passed and he was 
just on his own search,

444
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,560
you know,
so he disappeared from the academy.

445
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:18,561
But every night I'd come home and he 
would be there and he wouldn't ask me 

446
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:22,131
how was school.
He would ask me how was training and I 

447
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:22,131
would tell them,
oh man,

448
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:25,410
I got smashed or this happened,
or I got stuck in this position,

449
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:29,430
so at the dinner table or at the front 
of the TV,

450
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,940
he would give me an answer to my problem
and he would give me advice,

451
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:37,941
you know,
whether it'd be about Jujitsu technique 

452
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:37,941
or whether it be about what happened 
here or how to,

453
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:42,390
how to react to what this person did.
And so my learning magic Jitsu really 

454
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,220
growth happened over food,
over,

455
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:48,750
you know,
watching tv,

456
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,170
you know,
that's where I really learned what I 

457
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,840
learned and then went back and trained 
at the academy and practice what I was 

458
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:56,840
taught.
So,

459
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,720
um,
most of my Jujitsu I learned through 

460
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,461
verbal,
like just like conversations at the 

461
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:05,760
dinner table and being able to,
do,

462
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:08,040
you know,
from that really

463
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,790
your dad had a,
that approach which was different than 

464
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,390
voices approach and different than many 
other people's approach.

465
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,660
This approach of mastering the physical 
as well as mastering technique.

466
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,280
You know,
your dad is an accomplished Yogi,

467
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,940
is very physically strong.
That was one thing that really separated

468
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,460
him from a lot of the other people in 
the Gracie family.

469
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,860
Yeah,
I definitely think so.

470
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:35,861
I think what separates my dad from not 
only everybody in the family but from 

471
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:40,010
most fighters is his,
not only his mental strength,

472
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,820
but his spiritual strength and he's a 
very spiritual person.

473
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:46,430
And um,
I think that's huge,

474
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,110
you know,
especially now in my life,

475
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,150
realizing how important that is a part 
of me,

476
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,660
I think being spiritually connected to 
yourself and connected to whatever is 

477
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:55,910
above us is,
is,

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,200
is something that really sometimes 
things you can't explain happen when,

479
00:24:01,591 --> 00:24:06,591
when you're that connected.
So my dad has always been a very 

480
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:06,591
spiritual person.
You know,

481
00:24:06,591 --> 00:24:10,961
he's,
he's doing all the things that he does 

482
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:10,961
for his purpose,
you know,

483
00:24:10,961 --> 00:24:15,011
if you talked to him for about money,
money is just secondary to,

484
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,360
to what his beliefs are.
And so as opposed to some people who 

485
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,390
they will go against what they believe 
in or they'll go against their 

486
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:25,970
spirituality for a paycheck.
So my dad,

487
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,500
you know,
never,

488
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,240
never did that,
you know,

489
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,580
he never took,
you know,

490
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,280
sponsors for,
for beer or whatever,

491
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:39,281
you know,
because he doesn't believe that that's 

492
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:39,281
necessarily the image that he wants to 
go with.

493
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:42,680
And I think he's a very spiritual person
and he and I still,

494
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:46,250
even today I'm like surprised with how 
much of a,

495
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,770
how much honor and,
and you know,

496
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:50,660
like,
you know,

497
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,020
it's just weird to describe how,
how,

498
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,480
how good he he's done for Jujitsu.
Really

499
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,540
the growing up in that atmosphere.
That's an incredible role model to have 

500
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,530
that as your dad,
this guy that's got such a high moral 

501
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,770
standard and he,
how did he get into yoga?

502
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Because that's another thing that really
separated him from a lot of other 

503
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,520
martial artists and really opened up a 
lot of people's eyes to the beneficial 

504
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,550
aspects of yoga.

505
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,180
So he got into yoga with this guy,
Orlando Kearney,

506
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,240
who is a Brazilian,
a yoga guy who basically his whole 

507
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,330
theory was breathing with your movement.
So being able to.

508
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,570
Because Yoga is usually you breathe in,
you stop and you kind of breathe in.

509
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,600
You just do your movements and your kind
of just static,

510
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,730
but he kind of incorporated breathing 
with movement and being able to like,

511
00:25:39,731 --> 00:25:40,300
he would be like,
oh,

512
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:41,290
I'm gonna,
I'm an animal.

513
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:46,291
I'm a tiger.
So he would walk like a tiger and you 

514
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:48,160
breathe and you look and he would 
visualize himself like a tiger.

515
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,540
So he started to be able to to not only 
do that as animal,

516
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:55,840
but he started to transfer it over to 
Jujitsu and being able to.

517
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,570
Because this theory,
the guy's theory,

518
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:02,050
Orlando counties theory was animals are 
perfect,

519
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:07,051
you know,
they move and they breathe and they 

520
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:07,051
don't get tired and everything is in 
sync.

521
00:26:07,051 --> 00:26:10,810
So his whole theory was,
the better you can do that,

522
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,960
the more you can replicate that,
the more you're going to be able to be 

523
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:15,960
efficient with your,
with whatever you do.

524
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,660
And the yoga for my data I guess was a 
huge,

525
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,370
huge part.
And,

526
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:26,371
you know,
since a little kid he kind of always 

527
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,620
told me about breathing and yoga and I 
never cared and just kind of brushed it 

528
00:26:29,081 --> 00:26:34,081
off until when you get older and you 
start really having difficulties when 

529
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:36,190
you really start searching and really 
start having problems,

530
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,640
then I started to start to breathe more 
and now I think that the breathing is a 

531
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,840
huge part of my,
my myself and it's a huge part of my 

532
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,530
growth and it's a huge part of me being 
able to be in,

533
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,910
be in tune with what I'm doing.
So I wouldn't take away that for 

534
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,251
anything.
And I think that's probably one of the 

535
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:58,251
biggest,
you know,

536
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,670
additions to my,
to myself that I could have added.

537
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,320
Yeah.
The Yoga breathing is a thing.

538
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,840
Pranayama,
is that what they call it?

539
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,280
I don't know.
Uh,

540
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,830
yeah.
Prada Yama is a,

541
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,970
is a huge part of,
uh,

542
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,150
what a lot of people are missing when it
comes to the idea of yoga.

543
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:20,151
They don't,
they don't understand that deep 

544
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:20,760
breathing and breathing exercises are 
there.

545
00:27:20,761 --> 00:27:23,780
They're very difficult to do.
It's very difficult.

546
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:28,160
And it becomes like a factor of motivate
you can do this shit to write shitty dad

547
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,790
does with the abdomen.
Of course.

548
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,510
Yeah,
I do that.

549
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,600
Um,
what is that,

550
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,980
that,
that crazy video if folks who haven't 

551
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,381
seen this is a documentary called choke.
It's an amazing documentary and it was 

552
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,780
back when Hickson was competing in 
Japan.

553
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:46,380
Valley Tudos was like 1995 or 
[inaudible] 94 95.

554
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,860
And he,
there's a video that really like opened 

555
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,621
up a lot of people's eyes of him doing 
yoga and moving his stomach around with 

556
00:27:56,621 --> 00:27:58,520
these weird stomach exercises.
What,

557
00:27:58,521 --> 00:28:00,840
what is that?
So your diaphragm.

558
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,590
Well,
I can kind of explained.

559
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:06,580
But basically your,
your,

560
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,600
your lungs are like,
oh,

561
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,320
like bottles,
they start screaming at the top and then

562
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,620
they,
they fill up to be big at the bottom.

563
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,950
So when you normally breathe you,
you're only filling up a small portion 

564
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,240
of your lungs.
And when you get scared or when you have

565
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:27,241
anxiety,
everything is shortens your breath and 

566
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:27,241
then screwed.
Yeah.

567
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,040
So that's what normally happens.
That's what's very normal for humans.

568
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:34,220
And being able to breathe through your 
diaphragm is filling your lungs to the,

569
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,250
to the Max and,
and being able to control that is so 

570
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,610
your diaphragm is a muscle and you need 
to train it like a pushup or like 

571
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:44,290
anything you do,
you need to train your muscles.

572
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,980
So the more you train your muscle,
the more control you have over it.

573
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:53,010
And that is just being able to have the 
highest control of your diaphragm 

574
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,210
muscle.
And when you have that kind of control,

575
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,480
you can filter your body out easier as 
opposed to like right now,

576
00:29:00,491 --> 00:29:03,640
if you don't train it,
you can't even like use your diaphragm.

577
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:03,820
So

578
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:04,520
sure

579
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,520
that just that simple movement is,
is it difficult,

580
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,920
uh,
is a difficult thing to do.

581
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,930
You have to train to do that.
And then being able to do that.

582
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,600
So what you're doing as you're breathing
in deep and then you're pulling your 

583
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,210
diaphragm in

584
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,640
that actual exercise that you do is you 
exhale,

585
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:34,490
you have no oxygen in your lungs,
and then you use your.

586
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,840
Then you just kind of massage your 
diaphragm and you kind of just have that

587
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:43,841
kind of control so you're just 
practicing like how to move it because 

588
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:47,341
when you're training and you're tired 
and if you have to think about to 

589
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:49,501
breathe,
its already too much so you should just 

590
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,690
have it.
It's like a one of those things that 

591
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:51,690
start fire.
When you push out,

592
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,390
it's when you open it up,
it fills up naturally,

593
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,760
so if you learn how to breathe through 
your diaphragm,

594
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,830
you naturally are going to filter way 
more oxygen and you're going to have a.

595
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,100
everything's going to be better.
I like that's the reason why I can train

596
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:08,200
as long as I can train and why I can 
stay clear.

597
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:13,201
And normally a lot of people they they 
get cast out or they or they feel like 

598
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:15,550
they're going to pass out or or they get
anxiety.

599
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:20,140
So being able to breathe correctly is a 
huge part of my growth.

600
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,680
I think.

601
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,370
Learn that from your dad.
The diaphragm breathing.

602
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,810
What does he call it?
What it.

603
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:25,600
Is there a name for it?

604
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:30,670
No,
because we're not necessarily like yoga 

605
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:30,670
crazy,
you know,

606
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,980
super into a specific type.
I think I just use yoga for my benefit 

607
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,940
and I'm not like a ride or die of a 
certain type of yoga.

608
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,900
I just kind of use yoga for my,
for,

609
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,930
for what I do for Jujitsu and how to 
become a better person so I don't know 

610
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,951
exactly what the name is or anything.
It's just being able to breathe and 

611
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,561
being able to use my diaphragm and being
able to stay calm and learn how to 

612
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:57,910
manage my energy.
So that has helped me not only with 

613
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,140
Jujitsu but anything new I do or if I'm 
going to come here on an interview,

614
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,910
if I start to get nervous,
you know,

615
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,200
I breathe in,
it goes away.

616
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:08,201
So the breathing has helped me become,
is given me an opportunity to do 

617
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,020
everything that I can do.

618
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,530
Yeah.
I do a lot of deep breathing exercises,

619
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,900
um,
in a sensory deprivation tank.

620
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,920
And one of the things that I do is a 
long breathing.

621
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:23,190
Like I'll,
I'll have an inhale that lasts a minute 

622
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,420
and then the exhale last a minute and is
a,

623
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:29,421
it's a discipline,
like you have to force yourself to 

624
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:29,800
maintain that pace because you get to a 
panic.

625
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,070
He just want to fuck this,
but you can stay alive and keep doing 

626
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:40,711
it.
You can do it and you can still stay 

627
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:40,711
alive and keep doing it,
but it's,

628
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:41,440
it becomes this weird thing where your 
body starts freaking out.

629
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,790
It's like breathe,
motherfucker,

630
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:43,990
stop breathing out,
breathe,

631
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:44,890
breathe,
breathe in,

632
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,010
breathe out for a minute and then 
breathe in for a minute.

633
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:48,910
Breathe out for a minute

634
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,470
there.
Yeah,

635
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:51,360
there is different types of exercises.
I know,

636
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:55,680
like sometimes if I'm,
if I'm trying to stay calm,

637
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,720
I'm going to breathe slower.
If I'm trying to get energy,

638
00:31:57,721 --> 00:32:00,930
I'm going to breathe faster.
If I'm trying to maintain a high pace,

639
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm going to,
you know,

640
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,870
it's like a car when you drive a car,
if you're driving slow,

641
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:07,070
uh,

642
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,380
but if you drive fast cars,
so you need like when I train,

643
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:13,510
if I'm in a very intense,
I'll breathe loud.

644
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:18,280
Like so to make sure I'm getting enough 
oxygen to,

645
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,680
to keep up with what I'm doing 
physically.

646
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:25,681
So I definitely am very grateful for 
being able to have that a part of my 

647
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:28,210
life.
And it's cool,

648
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,080
man.
It's really good.

649
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,240
I only experienced that breathing for 
the first time in Jujitsu after a 

650
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,631
lifelong martial arts.
I'd never heard anybody breathe like 

651
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,531
that until I started training and uh,
at John jocks academy and hearing 

652
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:42,830
people,
you know,

653
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:47,831
hearing like black belts roll here guys,
really what the fuck are they doing it?

654
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,190
But yeah,
it was a white belt.

655
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:51,060
I was walking around with everybody 
doing it was,

656
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:54,950
it was such a strange thing.
And John Jack explained to me that,

657
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:55,410
you know,
when,

658
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,830
when you breathe out you will definitely
breathe in,

659
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,970
force yourself to breathe out and then 
get rid of all the car.

660
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Yeah.
The bad air in your body and breathe in 

661
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,590
fresh oxygen.
And that the forcing it out is something

662
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,090
that people don't concentrate enough on.

663
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,770
Yeah.
When you normally want to breathe,

664
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:14,150
you breathe in and then that only fills 
up that top part,

665
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,080
you know.
So if you,

666
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,260
I mean is there a lot about it,
but I think it's definitely a huge part 

667
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,240
of my success today and it's also a huge
part of my dad's.

668
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,890
Yeah.
I would recommend to anybody who is 

669
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,830
interested in this to go and just look 
up various yoga,

670
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:34,831
breathing videos on youtube and just 
follow along with them and you'd get a 

671
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:37,030
great benefit from that and it's 
something that people don't really think

672
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,880
too much about,
about concentrating and controlling your

673
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:44,881
breathing.
And there's also a great meditative 

674
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,450
quality to that too.
I'm one of the first breathing exercises

675
00:33:46,451 --> 00:33:49,960
I ever did when I was really young.
So many told me that you can meditate by

676
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,530
just concentrating only on your breath,
just not,

677
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,090
not even a breathing exercise,
but just breathe in good and out bad and

678
00:33:58,091 --> 00:34:01,690
think of nothing but those things.
I think as you're breathing in,

679
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,530
you're taking in oxygen and as you're 
breathing out,

680
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:06,750
you're just pumping out in with the good
out the bad.

681
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:11,751
I just think of those things and think 
only of your breath and by forcing 

682
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:14,941
yourself to concentrate on that,
it sort of filters out everything in 

683
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:14,941
your life and it all becomes like 
background.

684
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:19,741
Everything else sort of calms down and 
you get this feeling after you're done 

685
00:34:19,741 --> 00:34:20,860
doing that.
If you do that for an hour,

686
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:26,490
everything else sort of like the.
The importance of things that you 

687
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:28,700
thought was so big and so crazy in your 
life and all this is fucked up,

688
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:32,020
but what am I going to do about that?
It seems less important after that.

689
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,240
Yeah.
I think the breathing keeps me in touch 

690
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,280
with my spirituality and being able to 
breathe.

691
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,750
Like I've gotten into some,
some super gnarly trances where I'm,

692
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,220
you know,
really connected to whatever is above us

693
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:51,290
and that's through the breathing so that
like being able to breathe and like 

694
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,510
after your training or during your 
training or however you like to do.

695
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,710
It has given me like a huge,
huge benefits and I,

696
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,910
I connect myself too when I'm training,
like being able to breathe puts me in a,

697
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,340
in a very animal like state where it's 
like me against you.

698
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
It's not,
I'm not thinking about what you're 

699
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,400
doing.
I'm not thinking about,

700
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,680
oh,
I am thinking about what you're doing,

701
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:20,681
but I'm not thinking about things.
It's more of like a feeling and that 

702
00:35:20,681 --> 00:35:21,770
feeling.
The closer you are to that feeling,

703
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,130
it gives you almost above your mind 
above you can actually think it's more 

704
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:32,411
like a of a,
of a animal instinct and that like since

705
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:38,021
I started to really incorporate the 
breathing and the connecting it to my 

706
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:38,610
Jujitsu,
it's given me way more.

707
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,250
Well,
there's a,

708
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,870
a whole group of people that use 
breathing.

709
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:47,871
It's called holotropic breathing and 
they use it to achieve psychedelic 

710
00:35:47,871 --> 00:35:52,821
states.
They have achieved psychedelic states 

711
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:55,401
for sure.
Like what's the most intense state 

712
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:55,401
you've ever achieved while breathing?

713
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:59,010
Oh,
I mean I think a couple of times after 

714
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,010
training when I'm really exhausted,
like I'm very,

715
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,450
very,
very,

716
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:03,350
very exhausted to a point where you want
me to stop training like 30,

717
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:08,240
40 minutes before and then after I'll do
a breathing,

718
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:11,010
breathing in and out and I'll just keep 
going into the breathing and as I,

719
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,900
as I start to breathe and start to get 
more in tune,

720
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:19,901
there's nothing exists and it's just me 
and I can almost see the particles in 

721
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:22,430
the air and I can.
It's just like a sensation that,

722
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:27,431
you know,
I've only felt a couple of times but I 

723
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:27,530
definitely have gotten in touch with 
like,

724
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,250
it's very,
it's very intense to like to get to that

725
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:34,640
point where you just feel.
It's almost like you can see the air.

726
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's almost like you can see and like 
all these little things and it's pretty 

727
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,370
intense.

728
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,140
So I've gotten to that point a couple of
times or three or four points were where

729
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,790
I feel like,
wow,

730
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,620
I can actually feel the energy.
And it was a great thing,

731
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:52,590
man.
I'm like,

732
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,680
after if you feel high and you smile and
you're like,

733
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:58,160
man,
this is crazy and crazy that you can,

734
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,340
how much we're capable of as humans and 
how much will do is so big and you know,

735
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:09,080
you think about the actual world and how
the actual world is,

736
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,100
is like this planet.
We should be in touch with something 

737
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,100
above,
you know,

738
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:18,730
we should be able to in touch with how 
this got to this or how there's 

739
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,570
Waterhouse Salami.
All these things that we today are like,

740
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,350
oh no,
that's this,

741
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,290
that's this or this is that.
It's so much more.

742
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,490
You can explain shit,
you know.

743
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:30,491
So it's like really?
I go a lot more about my feelings these 

744
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,390
days than anything else.
You know,

745
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,910
over my rational decision.
I kind of try to feel how things are.

746
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:38,120
I feel how people are feel,
how I feel,

747
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,420
how I,
how I feel about this training session 

748
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,631
or whatever it is.
I kind of try to go more about feeling 

749
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:45,631
because that's never failed me before.

750
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,510
So this,
these breathing techniques and he states

751
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:53,511
that you achieve the,
they give you a sort of a fresh 

752
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:56,421
perspective.
They give you a perspective of 

753
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,400
recognizing the greatness and the beauty
and the magnitude of life that sometimes

754
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:04,401
escapes us and our normal everyday path 
where you just sort of take for granted 

755
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:06,360
that that's a door.
This is the house go outside,

756
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:08,400
that's the sky.
It becomes normal,

757
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:13,401
but these breathing techniques and the 
just the psychedelic states that you 

758
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,800
achieve from them allow you to almost 
like a reset button.

759
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,620
Yeah,
it's pretty cool,

760
00:38:18,621 --> 00:38:23,621
man.
I really recommend breathing in for 

761
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:25,160
anybody who is doing anything in their 
life,

762
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:30,161
whether it'd be something you know,
whether you're trying to get through a 

763
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:33,371
tough situation,
whether you're arguing with your 

764
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:33,371
girlfriend or whether you're stuck in 
traffic or whether you're trying to stay

765
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,730
calm while somebody was trying to choke 
you.

766
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,570
The breathing has given me and it took a
long time.

767
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,350
It's not like,
oh boom.

768
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:39,730
I started breathing.
I got it.

769
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,180
It's actually took a long time before 
you really value it because when my dad 

770
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,381
started telling me this,
I kind of didn't care and I was just 

771
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:49,381
like,
whatever,

772
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:49,381
whatever.
He's got all kinds of.

773
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:50,220
She's always telling me Shit.
So,

774
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,430
but after,
you know,

775
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,480
the older I got,
the more I kind of started to have 

776
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,150
stress and have to deal with this 
pressure and then I kind of started to 

777
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,040
do it every once in a while and then now
it's at a point where the past few years

778
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:10,070
I've really stepped it up a lot and it's
really a big part of my,

779
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,640
my,
my training and my and everything.

780
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,320
I do.
So even when I skateboard now,

781
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,920
I'm like trying to breathe and I'm 
trying to like,

782
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,100
keep,
keep everything in tune so I can do the 

783
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,100
best I can do

784
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,910
the last time.
Um,

785
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,370
when,
when we had a dinner together,

786
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:28,860
your dad was still talking about 
competing.

787
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:30,810
He had,
he had stopped,

788
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,510
but he was still thinking about 
fighting.

789
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:35,400
He was still,
there was people,

790
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:40,401
you know,
there's always a threat on the 

791
00:39:40,401 --> 00:39:40,460
underground is one of the big themes in 
the underground is Hixon by Armbar.

792
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,560
They would,
they would joke around about anything,

793
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:48,561
you know,
who'd win Godzilla versus King Kong 

794
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:48,561
kicks in by arm bar was,
it is,

795
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:52,020
it was just an inside joke when someone,
something could be answered.

796
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,640
Someone just right Hixon via arm bar.

797
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:54,960
Um,

798
00:39:55,510 --> 00:40:00,510
did,
did he have any regrets that he didn't 

799
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,210
fight any of the big name guys that he 
didn't continue?

800
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,170
We were talking about him fighting 
fader.

801
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:04,570
He,
you know,

802
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,330
he was,
uh,

803
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:10,620
he was saying that if he did fight 
someone who would want to fight fate or 

804
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:10,620
who is the champion of pride at the 
time.

805
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,020
Yeah,
I think that,

806
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,600
I don't know if there's any regrets or 
anything.

807
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:16,710
I think it was just a time in my dad's 
life where,

808
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,450
well,
right after my brother passed,

809
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:20,910
you know,
he,

810
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,680
he got offered to fight Sakharova and it
was a big,

811
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:26,690
big payday and it was a big,
big fight.

812
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,690
And of course my dad being the man he 
is,

813
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:34,691
he wasn't going to just leave the family
to go train for a fight and take his 

814
00:40:35,661 --> 00:40:40,520
selfish needs into consideration.
So he kind of just took her,

815
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:44,570
which turned away the fight and kind of 
gave his energy to the family and try to

816
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:49,370
do what he could to help everybody.
And after that time passes,

817
00:40:49,371 --> 00:40:54,371
there's still like some,
some people wanting to have them fired 

818
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:54,371
and he was maybe five Fado and maybe 
with this.

819
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:56,900
But I think after that moment he kind of
just,

820
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,210
the time passed,
you know,

821
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:01,970
his fighting that time had passed for 
his,

822
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,700
even though he was still possibility for
him to fight,

823
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,950
I think that he necessarily.

824
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,460
He was ready to fight and as a man he 
was ready to die.

825
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,850
But I don't think that necessarily it 
was.

826
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,610
I'm glad that he didn't fight after 
that.

827
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,620
I'm glad that he,
you know,

828
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:23,920
it happened the way it did and he 
retired the way he did and he still has 

829
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,780
the greatest image.
So I think that it's,

830
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,320
I think it's a great thing that it went 
away.

831
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,340
Did you know,
like,

832
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:36,610
my dad is a great fighter and he's great
mind and that separates him from 

833
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,031
everybody else,
but I think that everything went fine 

834
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,410
even though whatever happened,
I think that he didn't need to fight.

835
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:44,330
He didn't need to prove anything to 
anybody else.

836
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,120
And even if he did fight,
win or lose,

837
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,510
that would have been his hammer his 
best,

838
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,350
you know?
So,

839
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,890
um,
I think my dad did enough from when he 

840
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:56,890
was 15,
when he was 40.

841
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,700
He proved enough people wrong.
He did what he had to do.

842
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:00,490
He was ready,
you know,

843
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,570
you don't know where.
It's like nobody knows what it's like to

844
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,360
be having to be ready to fight,
to die at any moment.

845
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,390
Motherfuckers come in your academy and 
they challenge you.

846
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,270
You got this guy telling him that he 
doesn't believe in Jujitsu.

847
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,150
So nobody knows what that feels like to 
have to be ready.

848
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,080
Everybody now,
Oh,

849
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:15,950
you want a fight?
Okay,

850
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,620
give me three months or six months.
I'm going to train for my fighter,

851
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,870
but to be,
have to be ready at any time,

852
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,210
any moment,
no matter what.

853
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,800
You know,
that's where my dad lives,

854
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,730
like from 15 years old to 40 years old.
So he needed to retire,

855
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:33,731
he needed to be able to not be ready.
He needed to be able to release and I 

856
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:36,200
think that was the best thing for him 
and it was the best thing for his life.

857
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,970
And now I think it's all good and it's 
just a very tough situation,

858
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:45,971
man.
I lot of people don't know how serious 

859
00:42:45,971 --> 00:42:47,651
my dad took.
Of course people know how serious but 

860
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:47,651
you only see the glory,
you know,

861
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:50,540
you don't see how he really is as a man 
and how,

862
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,270
how you,
you really make it your life,

863
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:58,290
you know,
and fighting is a big thing is probably 

864
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:58,580
the hardest thing to do.
And you know,

865
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:02,110
that guy was ready anytime,
anywhere where approved,

866
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,470
very approved.
The family was,

867
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:07,490
was better ready to prove that he was 
better and you know,

868
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:10,430
that's what gives me inspiration to,
to wake up in the mornings and do what I

869
00:43:10,431 --> 00:43:15,431
do.
And I only really do it because of him 

870
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:16,220
and my brother.
I only really compete because of him and

871
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:16,940
my brother.
I only,

872
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:22,510
the more my motivation is to keep,
keep him happy and to keep this family 

873
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,360
remember instead of just,
Oh,

874
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,790
the gracies work good when nobody knew 
Jujitsu,

875
00:43:28,791 --> 00:43:29,810
but now everybody doesn't.

876
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,930
They're not the nowhere.
So I,

877
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:36,931
I think it's important for my life.
I've already kind of am willing to 

878
00:43:36,931 --> 00:43:39,620
sacrifice my life and willing to 
sacrifice whatever I feel and how I like

879
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,650
things to be for the bigger objective,
which is to keep my father and my 

880
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:45,540
grandfather,
you know,

881
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:51,070
alive and well in their legacy.
Will you there for any of those 

882
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,480
challenge matches?
When Anjo came to the,

883
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:54,440
uh,
I was.

884
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:56,690
So Joe,
I was a little kid at that time.

885
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:59,610
I was like maybe four or five years old 
and um,

886
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,270
I remember the days happening and it's 
happening.

887
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,840
I wasn't there at the specific advice 
because not even my dad was at the time 

888
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,460
and my dad was at home in breakfast and 
the guys came and called them.

889
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:11,060
I was like,
dude,

890
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,760
because in Japan were invading the 
academy.

891
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,120
So my dad got up and like got ready to 
go to the academy and that was like 

892
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,691
another thing like you just waked up 
that I was going to be another day for 

893
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:25,631
him to go on a bike ride and then 
motherfuckers outside the academy ready 

894
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:26,870
to challenge you with all this press and
you know,

895
00:44:26,871 --> 00:44:30,020
if you lose,
it's just as like a real fight,

896
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,590
you know,
for folks don't know.

897
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:31,990
That's

898
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,400
one historical match that apparently a 
gordon has just said he seen is a Yogi 

899
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:43,581
and Joe who is a pro wrestler and MMA 
fighter in Japan just showed up at the 

900
00:44:43,651 --> 00:44:48,651
academy and Hixon took him into a back 
room and beat the fucking shit out of 

901
00:44:49,021 --> 00:44:50,340
him.
And Your Dad,

902
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,910
you know,
he,

903
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,320
he came out and Yohji Andrew's face 
faces,

904
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:58,700
photos of his face online.
We can see what your dad did to him.

905
00:44:58,701 --> 00:45:03,701
But I've heard all sorts of stories 
about the way he choked him and all 

906
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,830
sorts of,
you know,

907
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,730
I don't know.

908
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,000
True story,
true story.

909
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:12,001
I seen the video many times and I used 
to bring my friends over when I was a 

910
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,851
kid and show them the fights and 
everything is in Joe's face up on that 

911
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:15,690
screen.
So the story behind that as he came into

912
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,280
the academy and,
and it's a long story,

913
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:23,281
but I'll kind of sum it up,
but basically came in to challenge my 

914
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:23,281
dad and my dad was like,
okay,

915
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:26,941
fine.
So he shows up at the academy and they 

916
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:29,851
kicked all the press out because he 
didn't want them to film in case 

917
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,060
whatever happened.
So he kicked all the press out and then 

918
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,670
just the guy on Joe and his manager were
in the,

919
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,720
in the academy.
My Dad was having a car or my dad's 

920
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,531
black belt was having a class where 
there was a bunch of students there and 

921
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:43,660
yeah man,
just like everybody says,

922
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:45,100
my dad beat the shit out of this guy.

923
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,290
Like this guy came in and my dad 
instantly took them down,

924
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:49,720
mounted him up.
And in the beginning of the fight,

925
00:45:49,721 --> 00:45:54,721
the guy turned his back to try to get 
put to sleep because he realized he was 

926
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:58,951
going to lose,
so he gave him his back to get to sleep 

927
00:45:58,951 --> 00:45:58,951
in.
My Dad was like,

928
00:45:58,951 --> 00:45:58,951
no,
you're going to take more punishment,

929
00:45:58,951 --> 00:45:59,830
you're not going to get put to sleep so 
easily,

930
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:04,831
you know,
so he kept beating them bad and it was 

931
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:04,831
like,
it was hard to see,

932
00:46:04,831 --> 00:46:05,410
you know,
as even as a kid and he broke his nose,

933
00:46:05,411 --> 00:46:08,470
you can hear his nose break and it's a 
pretty big beating.

934
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:11,920
And then after he fought,
put them to sleep,

935
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,730
he called the press and the press came 
in and took pictures and everything.

936
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,840
Andrea went back to Japan saying that he
got jumped by the academy,

937
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:24,520
that we all jumped him.
And then my dad had filmed it,

938
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,070
brought,
brought the video to Japan,

939
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,670
was like,
look,

940
00:46:27,671 --> 00:46:29,500
this is the fight.
Showed all the press.

941
00:46:29,501 --> 00:46:31,630
And they were like,
oh yeah,

942
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:32,740
they all like,
you know,

943
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,890
thought it was very bad that he had lied
and said that he got jumped in front of 

944
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:38,740
TV.
So anyways,

945
00:46:38,741 --> 00:46:41,430
yeah.
That fight is true and what isn't it put

946
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,580
that online?
I don't know.

947
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,280
That's a good question,
but I think he just because it's martial

948
00:46:45,281 --> 00:46:46,420
arts history.
Yeah,

949
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,320
I'll,
I'll talk to them.

950
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,770
Itunes.
You probably make 100 grand,

951
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:54,390
you know,
sell that thing on itunes for a buck and

952
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:56,530
you probably make $100,000
easy.

953
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,330
Easy.
I think so.

954
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:01,930
I mean maybe I'll promote it,
let me know man,

955
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:03,760
let me know when it's up.
I'll put it on twitter.

956
00:47:03,761 --> 00:47:08,761
I'll put it on the podcast.
I'll let people know I pay a buck to 

957
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:08,761
watch that.
Right.

958
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,240
I'll pick 20 bucks to watch that Shit.
That to me,

959
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:14,260
that's one of the great challenge 
matches in martial arts history.

960
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,500
I mean there's your dad versus a Hugo 
Duarte on the beach in Rio.

961
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:22,090
There's like a few of those that you can
see.

962
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,820
You know there's a few of those which is
fucking crazy.

963
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:29,821
I mean they were duking it out on the 
beach in sand know pretty,

964
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,140
pretty,
pretty wild.

965
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,340
You could see that,
but that wasn't the prolonged beating.

966
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,200
You know,
he let him up after he kicked his ass.

967
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,380
I think my dad,
because there were so many videos of 

968
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:43,720
everybody fighting the gracie in action 
videos had came out,

969
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:48,750
all these videos were out.
I think my dad just wanted to keep 

970
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,660
something for himself and wanting to 
have some kind of power because 

971
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,730
everybody had taken all the footage and 
everything was used in whichever way,

972
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,760
you know,
my dad probably never got paid a cent 

973
00:47:59,760 --> 00:47:59,760
for the gracie in action videos are or 
anything.

974
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,910
So I think he was just wanting to keep 
something that he had power and,

975
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,360
and,
and it was good,

976
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,090
you know,
at this moment he has no value to that.

977
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:10,770
Yeah.
A dollar 99,

978
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:15,450
50 bucks.
There was also from the outside,

979
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,480
there was always the um,
the talk was always,

980
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,200
especially because uh,
you know,

981
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:25,220
I've been working for the UFC since 97,
so the people that I was working with 

982
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:25,590
like Campbell Mclaren and all those 
guys,

983
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:29,190
they had been there from ufc one and 
they were,

984
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:32,940
you know,
they'd said that the reason why I'm your

985
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:37,941
uncle didn't put your brother in our,
didn't put your father and instead put 

986
00:48:37,941 --> 00:48:42,351
hoists in that.
The reason why he did that was because 

987
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:43,680
he couldn't control Hickson.
Hickson was just,

988
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,840
you know,
he was the best of the family.

989
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:47,610
Everybody knew he was the best of 
family,

990
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,590
but that Horian knew that if he put 
Hixson Hixson wasn't gonna,

991
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
you know,
Hickson was going to do whatever you 

992
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:57,660
want it to.
He was,

993
00:48:57,660 --> 00:48:59,601
he wasn't going to listen to him and he 
wouldn't be able to control him the way 

994
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:03,291
he possibly controlled everybody else.
Is there any truth to that or what is 

995
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:03,291
it?

996
00:49:03,291 --> 00:49:07,860
So there's a lot of different things 
that happened in that kind of time and 

997
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:07,860
Arrow,
you know,

998
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,240
one reason why he's fought in the UFC 
and I,

999
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,480
my dad,
because my dad was the best,

1000
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:18,481
you know,
my dad would tap out hoists with one 

1001
00:49:18,481 --> 00:49:19,870
hand and in his belt before his fight.
So there was no doubt of that.

1002
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:24,130
One excuse I think was that Horian 
looked or hoist look more frail.

1003
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,430
He looked like a more of a normal guy.
So they wanted to make him.

1004
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,490
They wanted that to be able to prove 
that you do to is better.

1005
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:34,930
But ultimately,
I don't know if that's true or not and I

1006
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:38,230
don't know the exact reason,
but basically before that situation,

1007
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:41,490
a Horian and my dad had a,
had a,

1008
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,750
uh,
they kind of started to separate.

1009
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:45,340
They kind of started,
you know,

1010
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,720
to go their own ways.

1011
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,490
And I think in that situation,
again,

1012
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:49,720
I don't know,
100 percent,

1013
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:55,170
but that's what I kind of thing happened
and I'm sure horry and felt more control

1014
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:56,710
over,
over,

1015
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:59,080
over hoist.
Then he did it with my father.

1016
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,200
My Dad was kind of already starting to 
find his own way and do his own thing.

1017
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,750
And um,
yeah,

1018
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:09,751
I dunno,
I don't know too much about it because 

1019
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:09,751
we never really talked about that far 
back.

1020
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:11,590
But even I think I have talked to my dad
about it,

1021
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:14,500
but I forget because that's not really 
that important these days for me.

1022
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,810
Well,
you know,

1023
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:18,400
Horian gets a lot of.
Whoops.

1024
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:23,490
Whoring gets a lot of grief.
But I mean he was such a great promoter 

1025
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,780
of Jujitsu and if it wasn't for him 
doing that,

1026
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,150
it wasn't for him putting on those 
gracie in videos and promoting them.

1027
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,970
And promoting Jujitsu and promoting 
Gracie Jujitsu.

1028
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:32,610
It,

1029
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,880
yeah,
probably has a huge part of what Jujitsu

1030
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:41,881
and MMA is today that um,
he definitely made his value huge 

1031
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,850
because not only did he create the UFC 
but he,

1032
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:47,530
you know,
came to America,

1033
00:50:47,531 --> 00:50:48,680
he spread it,
he,

1034
00:50:48,681 --> 00:50:53,681
he,
he was the one challenge doing all the 

1035
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:54,040
challenges in doing everything.
So he was the reason really.

1036
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:59,280
And my dad was just a soldier,
was the guy that one representing and 

1037
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,230
ready to do what he had to do and you 
know,

1038
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:07,231
it's like Carlos and Leo.
Leo was the representative and Carlos 

1039
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,820
was the guy who kind of took care of the
academy and it was the theory behind the

1040
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:12,790
diets and the theory behind the names 
and stuff.

1041
00:51:12,791 --> 00:51:16,840
So I think neither one of them,
I think they're both responsible for,

1042
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,930
for the movement.
And yeah,

1043
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:21,910
I think it was a great thing.
Horian,

1044
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,160
they,
he did like even as academy,

1045
00:51:24,161 --> 00:51:25,990
look at his academy day,
it's like a museum,

1046
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:26,680
you know,
he has,

1047
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,430
it's like a five star hotel with shower 
head look at my academy and it's nothing

1048
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,940
like that,
you know,

1049
00:51:30,941 --> 00:51:33,460
my academy is,
it has some pictures and stuff,

1050
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:35,410
but it's not focused on that.

1051
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:38,590
My focusing is on the match,
will retrain what I teach.

1052
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,980
I'm not focused on promoting and being 
able to sell Jujitsu and being able to 

1053
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,330
expand.
Why the gracies you know,

1054
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:48,100
like for me,
you come in,

1055
00:51:48,101 --> 00:51:53,101
you're gonna be,
you're gonna come to me and telling me 

1056
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:53,440
if you know and you want to.
And horian was,

1057
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,430
he did a great job in expanding and 
showing the world in your face.

1058
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:57,790
Like,
here,

1059
00:51:57,791 --> 00:52:02,791
look,
this is what happens when this happens 

1060
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,831
and this.
So he was a great tool for the family 

1061
00:52:04,831 --> 00:52:04,860
and a great,
you know,

1062
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,820
he,
he made it happen.

1063
00:52:06,821 --> 00:52:07,180
You know,
he,

1064
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:08,170
he created a lot.

1065
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Yeah,
all of us fans of Jujitsu or Horian 

1066
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,450
Gracie,
a huge debt of gratitude without a 

1067
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,571
doubt.
And also because he produced his sons 

1068
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:22,350
that are also great promoters of Jujitsu
and the great the Gracie breakdowns I 

1069
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,350
one of my favorite things about after 
submissions after this,

1070
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:29,351
a submission in the UFC,
a Henna here on will get together and 

1071
00:52:29,351 --> 00:52:34,020
discuss with,
with great technical explanation all the

1072
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,220
various aspects of where someone went 
wrong,

1073
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:39,040
where things went right,
what was the proper adjustment,

1074
00:52:39,041 --> 00:52:41,740
what they did to get out of a bad 
situation.

1075
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,230
Really very,
very educational.

1076
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,590
And if you watch that show a UFC 
ultimate insider,

1077
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,120
it's on UFC ultimate insider.
It's so great because first of all,

1078
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:55,300
henry is so good at explaining these 
things.

1079
00:52:55,301 --> 00:53:00,301
He's so articulate and so charismatic 
when it comes to these breakdowns of 

1080
00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:03,700
positions is so much enthusiasm.
You know,

1081
00:53:03,701 --> 00:53:06,730
you watch these guys talk about these 
things and it makes you want to train.

1082
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,050
I mean,
it really does.

1083
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,740
It's a,
it's really good stuff and it just shows

1084
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,100
how much is going on with Jujitsu.
For folks who don't know,

1085
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,530
there's so much going on,
you know,

1086
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:19,950
for people don't know they're looking 
at.

1087
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:20,860
They think,
oh,

1088
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:23,320
this guy's trying to choke that guy.
And he's trying to stop it,

1089
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:28,321
but it's all about the and the intricate
details of leverage and movement.

1090
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:30,960
And these guys do a real good job 
breaking that down.

1091
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,260
Yeah,
they do do a great job breaking it down.

1092
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,280
And personally for me,
I've never been one to teach online or 

1093
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,520
through magazines or through stuff.
I think I believe the Jujitsu is a lot 

1094
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,510
more about feel and I don't,
I,

1095
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:48,790
I kind of don't do that.
I kind of disagree with myself teaching 

1096
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,630
online or through videos and all that 
stuff.

1097
00:53:50,631 --> 00:53:55,631
I kind of,
I want to be able to feel and look 

1098
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:55,760
somebody in the eyes if I'm going to 
teach them Jujitsu.

1099
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:00,110
And so yeah,
that's my philosophy behind that,

1100
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:05,111
but you know,
they're doing a great job of spreading 

1101
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:06,920
it to all those people who can't get to 
them and they do what they do.

1102
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,430
I'm not really a to in control of what 
they do or how they do it.

1103
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,150
But I know for myself,
I,

1104
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:17,151
I kind of don't do that and I kind of 
stick to my academy and where I teach 

1105
00:54:18,411 --> 00:54:20,420
and I focused on that kind of stuff.

1106
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:25,510
Right.
But what I'm talking about is their 

1107
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:26,610
explanations of those guys are in mma,
who rate

1108
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,790
for the native,
you know,

1109
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,420
those guys,
they,

1110
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:32,060
they,
they explained to the T.

1111
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,190
it's one of the more difficult aspects 
of doing commentary is explaining not 

1112
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,340
just recognizing positions and what's 
going to happen,

1113
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:43,341
but explaining to people positions and 
explaining what were the defenses were 

1114
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:48,410
the offenders and doing it all in real 
time while the mat scrambles are going 

1115
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:48,820
on and trying to like,
you know,

1116
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:54,580
you know,
what arms and Japanese at the left arm 

1117
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,991
with his left arm and you know,
you got to process all this stuff and 

1118
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:56,991
you had,
does he have his hand,

1119
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:57,210
his hands locked.
I can't see.

1120
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,760
And try to put it all into together and 
then explain it to the layman to explain

1121
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,280
to the person who doesn't train at home 
where it's just a massive bodies.

1122
00:55:05,281 --> 00:55:10,281
You know?
That's why I just focused on competing 

1123
00:55:10,281 --> 00:55:11,400
and training better for me.
Competing training and teaching.

1124
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:16,401
Yeah,
well I like that philosophy of looking 

1125
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:18,561
someone in the eye and,
and training because there is that 

1126
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:21,360
aspect of if you put a video out there 
you don't know who's learning your shit,

1127
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,290
you know?
Yeah,

1128
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,370
of course.
Very personal,

1129
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:25,310
right?
Jujitsu and it's very personal.

1130
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,340
I think so too.
You know,

1131
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:31,350
and while I'm still competing,
last thing I want is my enemies to be 

1132
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,310
able to see what I do and see how I do 
things.

1133
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:35,010
So yeah,
there's no way I would do that.

1134
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:39,190
One of the interesting aspects about you
and your Jujitsu career too,

1135
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,220
is that there's a lot of variation in 
Jujitsu and Jujitsu styles.

1136
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,010
There's a lot of new stuff that's come 
along,

1137
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,360
a lot of new techniques,
a lot of new strategies,

1138
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,080
but your,
your attacks and your Jujitsu,

1139
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:57,160
very much like your father's.
It's very much traditional Jujitsu,

1140
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:58,510
you know,
and there was a,

1141
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:03,630
there was a time when Vinny Magalhaes 
was on the ultimate fighter with a 

1142
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,970
Minotauro Nogueira and he was talking 
about minotauro.

1143
00:56:06,971 --> 00:56:09,100
Nogueira is Jujitsu and he said it's 
very basic,

1144
00:56:09,101 --> 00:56:11,560
very basic features are.
I mean it's all got really mad at him,

1145
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,890
but he,
he said he didn't mean it in a bad way.

1146
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,160
What he meant by.
It's the basics but honed to a laser 

1147
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,750
sharp edge.
Like there's nothing wrong with the,

1148
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,460
they're the foundation of Jujitsu and 
when I watch you compete,

1149
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,900
you're using the real traditional 
techniques of Jujitsu.

1150
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:36,901
You're not.
There's nothing like a tricky that 

1151
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:41,851
people haven't seen before.
It's just Jujitsu that's done to 

1152
00:56:41,851 --> 00:56:41,851
perfection.

1153
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,120
Yeah.
I think that the tricks they work 

1154
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,640
sometimes and they work if it's some 
good moment,

1155
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:51,420
you know,
like these,

1156
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,600
these new things that happen in these 
new ways to defeat your opponent.

1157
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:59,601
So I'm always looking for a situation 
that's going to work all the time,

1158
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,490
you know,
so these tricks,

1159
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:07,590
the good positions or stuff,
they demand a lot out of you and they 

1160
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,541
only work if that situation happens.
So I'm not concerned with trapping 

1161
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:16,671
myself into a position that's good for 
me because I count on not being in good 

1162
00:57:16,671 --> 00:57:17,760
positions.
I count on being in a bad position.

1163
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:20,590
I count on being in another position,
so for me I'm,

1164
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,610
I'm,
I'm leaving my training sessions open 

1165
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,521
to,
to what may happen and I don't like try 

1166
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:31,320
to get to a certain position and then 
began my training.

1167
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,810
That's what I feel like happens most of 
the time.

1168
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,160
It's due to these days as you want to 
get to this grip,

1169
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,750
this grip and then from here you're 
going to start training.

1170
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,800
So to get to that position where you 
have your special grips and everything,

1171
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:49,070
it takes a lot of energy and it takes a 
lot of strength and I kind of based my 

1172
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,510
attitude so on leverage and techniques 
so that it'll work when I'm fresh,

1173
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:56,511
when I'm tired,
if I'm fighting a guy who's bigger than 

1174
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:56,511
me,
it doesn't depend on physical strength.

1175
00:57:56,511 --> 00:58:01,281
So that's where kind of my dad kind of 
forced me because I didn't always think 

1176
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:05,050
like this and you kind of given me the,
not only the,

1177
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,480
the technique and the leverage,
but showing me that it's possible 

1178
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,570
proving to me firsthand that it's 
possible for you to beat your opponents 

1179
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,570
with leverage.
To not use dream to say,

1180
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,070
so my like,
you know,

1181
00:58:17,071 --> 00:58:22,071
been been promoting this like little 
mini warrior in my mind for a long time 

1182
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:27,411
of how to be not only mentally but 
physically in training wise and 

1183
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:31,220
spiritually and it's been,
it's all helped me in and he's a great,

1184
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,460
huge part of,
of,

1185
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,870
of my success.

1186
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,380
One of the things I took from the 
conversation with your dad,

1187
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:39,080
we was talking about the various aspects
did you did too,

1188
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,380
but he was saying that first and 
foremost,

1189
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:45,530
one of the most important weapons that 
he has is his defense.

1190
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,420
That is always safe.
He said,

1191
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,740
at any position,
I'm always safe.

1192
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,430
He doesn't that.
He concentrates on that.

1193
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:56,530
And then the other thing was that when 
he moved from one position,

1194
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,100
I never forget this conversation.
He goes,

1195
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,400
we all started point zero from zero in 
the neutral point I moved to one and 

1196
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,920
when I get to one,
I'm not going back to zero.

1197
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:12,340
It sounds like he said he's a very 
interesting person,

1198
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:12,640
you know,

1199
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,410
but it's true.
If you watch his fights,

1200
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:17,920
he rarely loses positions.
There's no sloppy scrambles know.

1201
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:20,860
It's one of the things that I criticize 
people sometimes about an MMA,

1202
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:25,861
like guys leave too much space.
They go for things in a way they're not 

1203
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:29,570
in control of the position and he never 
did that when when he would mount a god,

1204
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:34,571
that motherfucker would stay mounted 
when he mounted the guy was just a 

1205
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,090
matter of time before we got an arm bar 
or whatever he got for you.

1206
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,130
Yeah.
It's pretty cool to see that the,

1207
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,470
I guess like everything in life,
everything goes back to the basics and I

1208
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:46,370
didn't like plan to have a certain type 
of style.

1209
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,240
I didn't like,
Oh,

1210
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:48,220
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

1211
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:51,260
Just try to train this style.
Just submissions only.

1212
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,850
No,
I didn't plan that.

1213
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:58,210
I'm planning and it's not like I'm going
to start a fight and I'm just going to 

1214
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,901
go for an arm rocker.
I'm going to go for a crazy submission 

1215
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:01,901
from nowhere.
It's not like that either.

1216
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:05,620
You're not gonna get that,
but my training sessions are to like 

1217
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:09,611
you're.
My Dad says to get to the next better 

1218
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:09,611
position to get to the next better 
position to get to the submission.

1219
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:12,860
So I'm never stopping my mind,
I've never stopped in my training,

1220
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,940
I don't stop in a place and be like,
okay,

1221
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,650
I'm going to breathe here for a second 
or I don't do that.

1222
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:23,650
I kind of always am looking for the next
place to get to the finish line and 

1223
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:29,290
that's created a very aggressive style 
because I'm always looking for the next 

1224
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,520
place to be and it's not necessarily 
like,

1225
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,110
oh,
I just go for submissions from anywhere.

1226
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:34,420
No,
I'm going for.

1227
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:39,460
Sometimes it may be to pass the guard or
maybe to do to get his leg off my hip or

1228
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:43,700
whatever it is that may happen.
So it's not like I'm just thinking about

1229
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:46,370
submissions or I'm not thinking about 
doing crazy.

1230
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:52,280
The tricky stuff,
it's just that those stuff may not fall 

1231
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,260
into what I'm mentally trying to do.
Your objective,

1232
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:56,480
my objective,
and I think that's the biggest thing.

1233
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,240
I don't think too much about it.
I just think about how am I going to get

1234
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:02,390
to a next better place?
How am I going to put him here?

1235
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,540
So it just comes kind of naturally at 
this point.

1236
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:10,541
I can't even.
Not trained that way if I try to train 

1237
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:15,550
any different way,
my Jujitsu sucks so it's become A.

1238
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:20,770
I'm glad.
I'm very grateful that it's become like 

1239
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,381
this and I have this type of style and I
had gotten as good as I got with the 

1240
01:01:23,381 --> 01:01:25,550
basics and with what I with the tools 
that I had.

1241
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:26,750
So I'm,
I'm super stoked.

1242
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:31,850
That became an issue in Abu Dhabi with a
lot of wrestlers that wrestlers would 

1243
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,920
take guys down and just hold them in 
positions and not go for submissions.

1244
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:39,060
Just try to go for points and you know,
and people would get furious.

1245
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:40,500
It'd be like,
well this isn't Jujitsu,

1246
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,310
but some people felt like the only way 
to compete with these guys is to do what

1247
01:01:44,311 --> 01:01:47,650
they're doing is to fight smart.
The only way you can win is to,

1248
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,350
to,
to fight on points.

1249
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:54,150
Would you rather lose on points then 
when?

1250
01:01:54,151 --> 01:01:55,380
By holding a guy down?

1251
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:57,290
Yeah.
I have lost like,

1252
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,990
that doesn't bother you.
It does.

1253
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:01,850
I mean you don't.
You show me a good loser.

1254
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:06,851
I'll show you a loser,
but you know.

1255
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:11,891
Yeah.
I rather lose on points with keeping my 

1256
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:17,021
mentality always with the objective to 
get into a better place then to stop my 

1257
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:22,841
game and to find out how I'm going to 
win this match while using the time on 

1258
01:02:22,841 --> 01:02:27,141
my side.
So I have fought matches where I lost 

1259
01:02:27,141 --> 01:02:31,010
when I could won,
I was winning on points and then I went 

1260
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:31,180
for something or I try to advance the 
position,

1261
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:33,180
then I lost it and then doing and then 
whatever.

1262
01:02:33,181 --> 01:02:35,160
The guy swept me and then I lost because
of the time right now.

1263
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:39,930
So I have lost matches like that and it 
served as a good learning experience and

1264
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,270
everything and you know,
yeah,

1265
01:02:42,271 --> 01:02:46,380
I'd rather lose on points then to sit 
there and stop the game and wait for the

1266
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:47,640
time to,
to,

1267
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,930
to run out because I will.
I don't know if I would feel like shit,

1268
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:56,931
you know,
I feel like deep inside me I have a 

1269
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:59,220
thing that I feel like really bad if I 
don't try to go for the next position.

1270
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:01,770
I feel guilty almost.
So like my grandfather's.

1271
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:09,160
So you were your Jujitsu and your,
um,

1272
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:14,190
your,
your path is clearly a work in progress 

1273
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,861
and even though you've achieved the 
great heights of being an Abu Dhabi 

1274
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,100
world champion,
while you're training and fighting,

1275
01:03:18,101 --> 01:03:21,130
you're always competing with that very 
specific mindset.

1276
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:24,130
So any setbacks are just going to be 
educational experiences.

1277
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,130
You learn from those setbacks and then 
next time you even greater,

1278
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,390
which is why when you came in,
was it second place in 2011?

1279
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,430
A third,
third place,

1280
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:37,450
2011.
They came back and fucking dominated in 

1281
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:37,750
2013.
That was a big leap man.

1282
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:39,520
Yeah,
that was good one.

1283
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,980
It was a good.
I think honestly,

1284
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:45,850
I think I was ready for it and maybe if 
I would've won in 2011,

1285
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,730
it wouldn't have been the same.
Or if I went in 2009,

1286
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:51,040
who knows what would happen.
But you know,

1287
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:55,420
I feel like now I'm ready.
I don't make more excuses about anything

1288
01:03:55,421 --> 01:03:57,160
and if I don't win,
it's my fault.

1289
01:03:57,161 --> 01:04:02,161
If I,
if the guy was good enough to stall me 

1290
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:02,161
out,
he was good enough to start me out.

1291
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:06,820
So I have to come up with some thing to 
be able to be better than he is,

1292
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:09,400
so I don't really take it in,
criticize them anymore.

1293
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:14,401
If the guy just stalls on me,
I expect that the guys are not going to 

1294
01:04:14,401 --> 01:04:17,731
want to fight me into.
They're going to want to start and get 

1295
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:17,731
some points in,
feel good.

1296
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:19,390
I expect that and I trained that 
situation and I'm ready for that.

1297
01:04:19,391 --> 01:04:22,030
And so far so good.
You know,

1298
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,240
I've been on a,
on a good,

1299
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:24,280
good run lately.

1300
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,420
Have you ever seen the video where Eddie
Bravo and I were talking about your 

1301
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,930
magic?
Dad was great for folks who don't know 

1302
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:36,350
in the finals that dude was trying to 
stall crawling out and starts making 

1303
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:40,340
chicken noises.
He's gone.

1304
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:46,510
And for a Jujitsu Guy,
I mean,

1305
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,250
do you want to talk about the ultimate 
mind?

1306
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:51,300
Fuck,
you're not just fighting against the son

1307
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:56,330
of the greatest ever,
but the greatest ever is making chicken 

1308
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,330
noises that you.
Yeah,

1309
01:04:56,330 --> 01:04:56,880
that was fucked up

1310
01:04:56,910 --> 01:05:00,050
because.
Because it started.

1311
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,090
When he did that,
I was like,

1312
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,730
man,
now I can't let this get to me too.

1313
01:05:04,731 --> 01:05:06,800
You know,
because my dad is over here,

1314
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:11,180
like of course I have to kind of try to 
keep in the final match.

1315
01:05:11,181 --> 01:05:13,490
I fought a guy who I had beaten many 
times before,

1316
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,070
so,
um,

1317
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,910
I knew that I could win,
but if I were to start letting myself 

1318
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,360
believe that I was gonna win,
Oh,

1319
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:23,950
I'm going to win because I had already 
won.

1320
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,140
It was going to completely mess up my 
mind.

1321
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:29,290
So I went into the fight like he was the
most difficult fight of my life.

1322
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:33,310
And when my dad started to get Fred,
I knew he was going to back away.

1323
01:05:33,311 --> 01:05:36,190
I knew he was gonna start me out and it 
was not getting to me.

1324
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,990
I was just like trying to do what I 
could do.

1325
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:41,560
I'm not going to go crazy because he's 
not wanting to fight me.

1326
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:46,980
I was expecting that the reps were gonna
warn him and take away points and I was 

1327
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,280
going to let that happen.
And Yeah,

1328
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:52,960
when my dad was like,
when you did that,

1329
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:54,450
I was like,
I was like,

1330
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,320
man,
I kicked chrome.

1331
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,000
Don't let it get it to you.
Don't let that shit get to you,

1332
01:05:58,001 --> 01:05:58,590
man.
Don't think,

1333
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,930
don't let him.
You have to make it so that me.

1334
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,450
So you and your dad are fighting 
together.

1335
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:09,750
Not against each other.
I didn't want to let him where he said 

1336
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:11,731
like affect my train of thought,
put more pressure on me to have to do 

1337
01:06:11,731 --> 01:06:15,181
something.
So I kinda kept my cool and thank God 

1338
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:18,391
like shortly after that he,
he got a point taken away for crystal 

1339
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,580
clean and then he went for the take down
and I got him in a good guillotine.

1340
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:24,910
So it all worked out as well.
And that victory right there,

1341
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:26,950
right there is like the happiest moment 
of my life.

1342
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:32,730
That's the greatest feeling ever.
And I think my dad still still so happy.

1343
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:35,260
I mean I haven't seen my dad that 
everybody that comes up and talks to me,

1344
01:06:35,261 --> 01:06:40,261
he's like,
you're dad hasn't been this happy in so 

1345
01:06:40,261 --> 01:06:42,271
long and to see him so proud and so,
so stoked to finally achieve that number

1346
01:06:43,181 --> 01:06:45,190
one place is a,
is a good thing.

1347
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,350
It was such a beautiful poetic moment 
too.

1348
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:52,351
When the guy shoots for the take down,
you immediately lock it up like this is 

1349
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:52,351
why this guy was

1350
01:06:52,351 --> 01:06:52,351
stolen

1351
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:56,950
right into the jaws of death.
You lock that thing on.

1352
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:58,460
Perfect too.
That was beautiful.

1353
01:06:58,490 --> 01:07:00,490
I mean he tapped out within like a 
couple of seconds.

1354
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,070
It was over.

1355
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,640
Yeah.
When he went for like.

1356
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:03,620
I mean I,
I have,

1357
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:06,060
I'm dangerous from a lot of different 
places,

1358
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:08,940
you know,
but when he went from my leg I was like,

1359
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:13,941
thanks buddy.
I was like this great Christmas present 

1360
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:16,500
and like boom,
everything fits so good.

1361
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:17,460
And,
and uh,

1362
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,470
it was,
it was a good good.

1363
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,340
I mean it was a great show in,
in,

1364
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:26,341
in that success of that competition kind
of just came from a lot of I trained my 

1365
01:07:26,341 --> 01:07:28,160
ass off,
like sacrifice everything.

1366
01:07:28,161 --> 01:07:33,161
And you know,
in life that's what you gotta do when 

1367
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:33,161
you want something,
you know,

1368
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:37,140
whether whatever field it is you have to
kind of really see what you wanted.

1369
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:41,970
And I saw my potential and I used it and
I kind of,

1370
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,440
you know,
anybody who saw me trained so hard.

1371
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,110
I trained for that fight.
I was ready to win.

1372
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,360
Yeah.
You want to see something crazy.

1373
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:52,380
Pull up a kron gracie Ninja training.
It's some bars in Santa Monica that's.

1374
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,370
I saw this the other day.
Somebody put it on my message board.

1375
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,340
On the thread of this particular 
podcast.

1376
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:03,090
When the podcast was announced you,
do you do this often?

1377
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,500
Is this wild video of you climbing up on
these bars in Santa Monica?

1378
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:12,090
You climb to the top and then you.
You're swinging like here's the video he

1379
01:08:12,091 --> 01:08:12,420
climbed.

1380
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,200
How often do you do this?
I mean,

1381
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,930
I live in Santa Monica,
so I go there all the time and I kind of

1382
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:22,931
always do just like some workouts and I 
like to be at the beach and in the 

1383
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:22,931
ocean,
but this is just like a joke,

1384
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:25,850
you know,
like it just kind of a little trick,

1385
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,210
you know?

1386
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:27,920
Yeah.
Well this little trick,

1387
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:33,360
he's jumping nine feet from one bar to 
the next swinging and then catching with

1388
01:08:33,981 --> 01:08:37,220
his arms like a monkey.
I mean this is some wild shit.

1389
01:08:37,221 --> 01:08:39,560
Dude.
This is on the chimpanzee shit

1390
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:42,410
that day.
Nate was the one filming that and he was

1391
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:44,900
super stoked on it.
And how often do you do that?

1392
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:48,680
I go down to the bars or at least like 
once or twice a week just to kind of,

1393
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:50,780
you know,
I do the ropes or climb the ropes for my

1394
01:08:50,781 --> 01:08:53,570
forearms and I do some of his stuff,
but you know,

1395
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:58,740
that's never like the biggest part of my
training or it's never the most 

1396
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:58,940
important thing.
It's always come secondary to training,

1397
01:08:58,941 --> 01:09:01,670
Jujitsu and my specific stuff I got 
going on.

1398
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:06,671
But when you train all day,
everyday you got to find ways to keep 

1399
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:08,720
yourself entertained and keep yourself 
enjoying what you're doing.

1400
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:11,390
And I hate being in a Jew.
I had been in a gym.

1401
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:12,950
Weightlifting,
gym.

1402
01:09:12,951 --> 01:09:13,440
Human.
Yeah,

1403
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,520
weightlifting gym and I hate being in 
there like working out and so if I'm 

1404
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:18,760
going to go on a bike ride,
I'll go outside.

1405
01:09:18,761 --> 01:09:20,000
If I'm going to run out,
go outside,

1406
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:25,010
I like to feel the fresh air and kind of
enjoy myself while I'm in this kind of 

1407
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,510
hill that I live in.

1408
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,080
It's kind of held perpetual training,
you mean?

1409
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:35,110
Yeah.
How much physical training do you do 

1410
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,110
besides the Jujitsu?

1411
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:38,800
I do a lot of energy too.
I do a lot of everything I run,

1412
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:40,420
I bike,
I swim,

1413
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,860
I do.

1414
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,150
And when you do it,
like what are the objectives?

1415
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:45,770
Like when you,
when you do you're running,

1416
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:48,230
are you monitoring your heart rate?
He doing sprints,

1417
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:50,290
eat tabata intervals.
Like what do you,

1418
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,280
how do you ever.
I do all the different types,

1419
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:57,340
you know,
sometimes I do just a long distance run 

1420
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,660
while run an hour and 10 or 20 minutes 
straight and then the goal would be for 

1421
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:05,351
that would be endurance and then I'll do
some days where I'll just do sprints 

1422
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:09,500
upstairs or some days I'll just do a 
bike long bike rides or you know,

1423
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,150
all those things.
I kind of just,

1424
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:16,270
some days it's more explosive and some 
days it's more long distance and I just 

1425
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:21,461
use it as a tool,
as an addition to two other things I do 

1426
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:24,320
and I felt like since I really started 
to put my energy into other things,

1427
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:29,740
it's made my Jujitsu better because the 
more in life when you sacrifice in one 

1428
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:30,650
direction,
no matter what it is,

1429
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,450
it gives.
It makes you better.

1430
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:37,570
I don't know how,
I don't know what it's like something 

1431
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:37,570
with the universe where no,
even if you say,

1432
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:42,371
oh,
I'm going to wake up at six in the 

1433
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:43,250
morning to go do 20 pushups and then go 
back to sleep.

1434
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,940
That is gonna make you better at what 
you do because you are going to start to

1435
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,920
create this energy to,
to achieve your goals.

1436
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:53,840
So once I started to really dedicate 
myself,

1437
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:56,200
not only with Jujitsu but with breathing
and,

1438
01:10:56,201 --> 01:11:01,201
and physical strength and,
and technical strength and mental 

1439
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:02,360
strength and all these different ways 
that I can build myself as a,

1440
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,180
as the best I can be,
it really went to show,

1441
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:07,460
you know,
it really made a big improvement.

1442
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:08,150
Since that moment.

1443
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:12,400
Do you find that the physical training 
helps prevent injuries?

1444
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,010
Do you find?
I do.

1445
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,770
I think it's important.
I think physical is training should be 

1446
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:25,521
done at a right time because if you get 
a white belt and you start telling them 

1447
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:29,900
all right,
you got to be physically strong and you 

1448
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,900
tell them to start working out and 
running and then he's going to create.

1449
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:33,180
His training is going to be based on his
physical strength.

1450
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:37,230
So my advice is the physical strength is
to,

1451
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:39,420
uh,
to add to your technical ability.

1452
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:44,421
It's not to take away from your 
technical ability and make you rely on 

1453
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:46,590
your strength and really make you rely 
on your physical attributes.

1454
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,920
So I always kind of don't push for,
for guys in my academy to work out until

1455
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,850
they reach a brown or black belt level,
then there they can,

1456
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,990
they can start adding to their technique
because if you get too strong,

1457
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,260
I've seen happen many times where guys 
will take steroids and then they'll get 

1458
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:03,260
so strong and they'll lose their 
technique.

1459
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:08,060
So I never wanted that to happen to me.
I knew that the strength was always 

1460
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:08,280
gonna be there if I,
if I worked on it.

1461
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:13,281
So I think it's important for you to 
build your technique and then secondary,

1462
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:14,940
you know,
your strength can keep,

1463
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:20,210
keep your technique going because of 
course if you don't have any physical 

1464
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:20,210
strain,
your technique will,

1465
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,120
will,
will fade,

1466
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:26,180
you know,
so you gotta have enough strength to 

1467
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:26,180
keep it,
to keep it going.

1468
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,840
Do you have a trainer that helps you 
with your physical strength workouts or 

1469
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,600
do you just know?
I got myself,

1470
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,920
that's,
that's how I count on all that you've 

1471
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,270
learned over all the years of martial 
arts.

1472
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:37,350
Yeah.
And like I said,

1473
01:12:37,351 --> 01:12:38,210
you know,
like it,

1474
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:39,960
it took,
um,

1475
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,560
you know,
when you're,

1476
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,010
when you're training for fights and when
you're,

1477
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,640
when you're getting ready.
My Dad left to Brazil when like,

1478
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,540
oh,
when I was 18,

1479
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:51,360
so I didn't have a coach,
I didn't have nobody.

1480
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:54,060
My Dad was in another country,
I didn't have a coach,

1481
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:57,720
I didn't have a strength trainer,
I didn't have nobody to give me any kind

1482
01:12:57,721 --> 01:13:02,400
of advice.
So for a long time I was kind of like,

1483
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,810
oh man,
this sucks.

1484
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:05,520
Like fuck,
everybody should be helping me.

1485
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,210
My Dad should be helping me.
I should have a trainer,

1486
01:13:09,211 --> 01:13:12,840
I should have fucking somebody,
you know,

1487
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:17,320
write my stuff down and I should have 
all this stuff and you know,

1488
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,260
I should be sponsored by Nike and I 
should have,

1489
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,540
you know,
like all these things that like,

1490
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:24,870
I compared myself to Colby Ryan.
But um,

1491
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,320
as you get better,
you realize that stuff's not going to 

1492
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:30,320
happen.
And,

1493
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,260
and I kind of got to a point where I 
kind of stopped making excuses and I 

1494
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,240
kind of started to blame myself for,
for,

1495
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:39,000
for my own success.
Not blaming other reasons,

1496
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:42,060
not blaming because I didn't have this 
or because I didn't have this or because

1497
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:47,061
my dad wasn't here,
so I'm grateful for my dad taught me as 

1498
01:13:47,061 --> 01:13:50,301
much as you can for as much as he did 
and got to a certain point where I 

1499
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:50,301
stopped blaming.

1500
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:54,800
I stopped blaming anybody for anything 
and I kind of just put all everything 

1501
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,120
into my hands.
So that was my,

1502
01:13:57,121 --> 01:14:02,121
what I do now and how my schedule is now
as a result of a lot of years of being 

1503
01:14:02,121 --> 01:14:03,780
on my own and being.
Of course I've had help here and there,

1504
01:14:03,781 --> 01:14:08,781
but nobody fully embraced being my help.
So of course I picked.

1505
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:14,270
I picked from the help from I can get 
from wherever I can get all this guy 

1506
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:14,500
taught me this one thing,
I'll do it.

1507
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:20,130
So I kind of go around and using my 
experience to make the best training 

1508
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:23,851
that fits for me and I've kind of 
finally got to that point where I know 

1509
01:14:23,851 --> 01:14:26,140
how to train hard to.
I don't overtrain to where I know I'm in

1510
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:31,141
shape to where I know a mental.
All that stuff was kind of starting to 

1511
01:14:31,141 --> 01:14:34,711
really combine well based on what I feel
and based on how I have lived my life 

1512
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:37,600
and how I've competed in how I've put my
body in stress,

1513
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:41,080
so I'm able to kind of get a good 
understanding of where I'm at.

1514
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,270
When your dad went to Brazil,
was he,

1515
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:48,300
was he teaching in Brazil?
My parents got split up and then my dad 

1516
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,880
went to Brazil to go recharge his 
battery just to hang out.

1517
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:52,780
Yeah,
to go.

1518
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,930
He just his.
His analogy is,

1519
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,840
his explanation is,
you know,

1520
01:14:58,841 --> 01:15:02,920
you put a coconut tree in America.
It doesn't grow,

1521
01:15:02,921 --> 01:15:07,921
Cook and you put a cup in Brazil in 
coconut grove.

1522
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:13,200
I cannot explain why,
so he was just to make some coconuts.

1523
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,640
So I think he just wanted to feel good 
and kind of be his on his little retreat

1524
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:23,800
and it worked well and now he just moved
back actually a couple months ago.

1525
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:28,890
He's moved back here and now he's kind 
of after eight years of living in 

1526
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:32,581
Brazil,
he's kind of got more motivation to be 

1527
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:32,581
here in America and be a part of my 
life.

1528
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:34,180
And I mean,
he's always been a part of my life,

1529
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:36,400
just,
I just don't,

1530
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:41,550
it's not like my dad didn't help me,
but he helped me up until I was like 18,

1531
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:45,040
gave me everything he could and then he 
let me be my own man.

1532
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:45,460
You know,
he,

1533
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,070
he let me do everything on my own,
make my own decisions.

1534
01:15:48,071 --> 01:15:50,080
If I wanted to do this,
I could do it if I wanted to do that,

1535
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:52,230
if I wanted to wake up at 3:00
in the afternoon I was going,

1536
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:56,080
I was my own man and had the freedom to 
do everything.

1537
01:15:56,081 --> 01:16:00,640
So he gave me the option to do whatever 
I wanted and think,

1538
01:16:00,641 --> 01:16:05,641
God,
I was able to really embrace that and 

1539
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:07,831
use it to my benefit and it'd be able to
do what I did with that kind of on my 

1540
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:09,610
own.
You know.

1541
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,820
Does your dad still train?
Um,

1542
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,880
my dad teaches when he doesn't train so 
much where he actually goes and tries to

1543
01:16:18,251 --> 01:16:20,690
get better.
He's a,

1544
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:25,740
he's kind of physically can't do it 
because he's got like 800 years in his 

1545
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:26,350
back.
He looks like a,

1546
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:27,610
you know,
he,

1547
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:29,410
his,
he's physically burn out,

1548
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,000
you know,
you,

1549
01:16:30,001 --> 01:16:35,001
you,
you train at the highest level for her 

1550
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:35,001
whole life with no.

1551
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:35,001
When you say Hernias,
you mean herniated disc?

1552
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:36,940
Herniated,
herniated discs.

1553
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:39,580
Yes.
So it's got his back's a mess.

1554
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:40,520
Oh yeah,
he,

1555
01:16:40,521 --> 01:16:42,430
he,
his doctor said he shouldn't be walking,

1556
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:47,431
but he walks so he can't train as much,
but he does put a gear on and he'll show

1557
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,540
move here and there and he'll do what he
has to do.

1558
01:16:50,050 --> 01:16:53,440
And um,
and I think he's happy with it.

1559
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,870
I think he's now he's gotten to a place 
where,

1560
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:01,950
where he is okay with being retired and 
he's okay with not being the frontline 

1561
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:06,250
and he's okay with,
with being at the stage where,

1562
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,250
where he is,
you know,

1563
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,690
he knew that the time that he had to be 
physically,

1564
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:15,030
it was up into this age and you know,
I guess when you start to,

1565
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:20,250
to fall out of your physical shape,
you want to fight it and you want to 

1566
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:20,250
know I can still do it.

1567
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:24,640
I could.
And I think now he's very happy being 

1568
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:24,640
the icon that he is in being,
you know,

1569
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,501
he helps me with what he can help.
He trains with what he can do and he's 

1570
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:31,450
still the man like w when he comes with 
me with theories and,

1571
01:17:31,451 --> 01:17:32,750
and,
and training stuff.

1572
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:33,350
I mean,
man,

1573
01:17:33,351 --> 01:17:36,770
it's like nobody else has the mind that 
he has.

1574
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:39,980
Even if you put his brain on anybody's 
body,

1575
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:42,860
there will be a champion for sure 
because he has a,

1576
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:48,340
an old.
He's a very great sense of how do I 

1577
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,330
adapt to anything.
So sometimes I'll come up with a move or

1578
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:51,560
I'll be like,
dad,

1579
01:17:51,561 --> 01:17:56,561
this has been giving me problems.
And even if him not training for 10 

1580
01:17:56,561 --> 01:17:59,291
years,
he'll still feel how to defend it or 

1581
01:17:59,291 --> 01:18:01,871
feel how to deal with that or to have a 
greater understanding of how to be.

1582
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:06,680
So I think he's just better now this 
time of his life,

1583
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:11,681
he's incorporating different things.
He's not focused on training hard that 

1584
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:14,321
time for him.
It's past the time for him to fight his 

1585
01:18:14,321 --> 01:18:14,360
past.
Now it's time for him to watch me fight.

1586
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,620
Now it's time for him to watch himself,
you know,

1587
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:20,930
teach or watching,
being an icon,

1588
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:21,620
you know,
start,

1589
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,930
you know,
what does he do for exercises?

1590
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:26,740
Oh,
he serves and he and he doesn't exercise

1591
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:29,060
and he'll do his little workouts and 
stuff and he's still,

1592
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:34,420
he's still very active but he's just not
going to go and train rounds after 

1593
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:38,621
rounds.
But he's definitely very healthy and 

1594
01:18:38,621 --> 01:18:43,571
physical.
A person and I mean if I have eight 

1595
01:18:43,571 --> 01:18:46,400
hurting your despite his age and I'm 
able to do what he did,

1596
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:47,870
I'll take that.
No problem.

1597
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:51,170
I'll take the eight and he has to be in 
the best in the world.

1598
01:18:51,170 --> 01:18:52,790
Note any day of the week.
So.

1599
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:55,760
Well they uh,
they can do a lot for those things now.

1600
01:18:55,870 --> 01:19:00,870
Yeah,
I mean he's going to doctors and if you 

1601
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:00,870
have any,
any advice?

1602
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:01,220
He definitely certainly do.
The,

1603
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:06,221
uh,
Regina King that I had done was because 

1604
01:19:06,221 --> 01:19:07,160
of a bulging disc and made a huge impact
on me.

1605
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:10,670
And it's also the same thing that a lot 
of football players have done.

1606
01:19:10,671 --> 01:19:14,510
Like Peyton manning had done on his neck
and he had two operations on his neck,

1607
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:16,610
was ready to retire,
went to Germany,

1608
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,640
had the blood spinning procedure done,
and now I was playing football than 

1609
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:21,640
ever.
That's great.

1610
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:24,080
Massive a antiinflammatory properties of
it.

1611
01:19:24,081 --> 01:19:29,081
And the good thing about it is it's 
using your own blood so it's not like 

1612
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:32,501
you're introducing a steroid or any 
unnatural a substance into your body 

1613
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,110
that's going to cause an adverse side 
effects.

1614
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:38,110
It's actually actually your own blood.
It's amazing to see with his body how 

1615
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:39,800
it's been,
how well he lives in,

1616
01:19:39,801 --> 01:19:42,680
how he's happy to.
He says,

1617
01:19:42,681 --> 01:19:47,681
if I can serve and I can do the things,
if I can train once a week and do the 

1618
01:19:47,681 --> 01:19:48,320
little moves here,
I'm okay with that.

1619
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:53,510
So I don't know how far he's trying to 
step into actually being feeling like 20

1620
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:58,511
years old again,
but I'm sure he'd be interested to hear 

1621
01:19:58,511 --> 01:19:58,511
what you have to say.
Well,

1622
01:19:58,511 --> 01:19:59,660
just pain relief and just the,
uh,

1623
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:04,661
the uh,
replenishing of his body's ability to 

1624
01:20:04,661 --> 01:20:05,780
move correctly.
It would be a huge impact.

1625
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:08,100
Um,
I know a lot of guys that

1626
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,040
are getting towards his age though that 
have done Jujitsu for a long time,

1627
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:14,380
have similar issues.
Ricardo Laborio told me he has seven,

1628
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,540
seven desks,
you know,

1629
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,720
and you know,
like standing next to Ricardo he's Kinda

1630
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,900
like hunched over and leaned down and 
when we were describing it,

1631
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:26,901
you know,
you could see like he has like a 

1632
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:26,901
winston,
his face,

1633
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:29,161
he's just thinking about the pain,
but still trains still goes out there 

1634
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,410
every now and then roles and just loves 
it and can't help it.

1635
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,080
That's the problem is Jujitsu,
so fun.

1636
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:37,110
It's too bad.
Your body's not indestructable to patty.

1637
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:39,560
Can't tap out,
but your bodies,

1638
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,970
you know,
rubber indestructable.

1639
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,240
He created like that for a reason.
I bet.

1640
01:20:44,450 --> 01:20:47,220
Yeah.
My Dad was still be mopping floors have,

1641
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,780
I'd be like,
this is my time now.

1642
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:54,720
They give me a break.
What was the last time your dad like 

1643
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,520
really seriously rolled?
How long ago was it?

1644
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,630
Uh,
I dunno.

1645
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:01,030
All I know is the last time we seriously
rolled.

1646
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:06,690
I got fucked up.
This is bad because I just got my black 

1647
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:07,120
belt and I was like,
all right dad,

1648
01:21:07,121 --> 01:21:09,340
you know,
at this time he was still kind of not.

1649
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:11,320
I mean he's had hernia disk for a long 
time.

1650
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:16,321
I,
he probably had her $800 disc when he 

1651
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:16,321
was fighting.
Really know.

1652
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:16,321
Yeah,
he,

1653
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:17,980
he's probably had it for a long time.
It's not just dealt with the pain.

1654
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:19,750
Yeah.
He's dealt with pain his whole life.

1655
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,950
And um,
I don't know exactly what,

1656
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:24,520
what is,
what the exact he has or doesn't have.

1657
01:21:24,521 --> 01:21:27,250
But um,
yeah,

1658
01:21:27,251 --> 01:21:29,230
like when I was 21 years old,
19,

1659
01:21:29,231 --> 01:21:31,780
I just got my black belt and I was like,
all right dad,

1660
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:33,700
let's go.
Since you're out of shape,

1661
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:39,540
let give me three minutes,
three minutes and we'll go as hard as we

1662
01:21:39,681 --> 01:21:44,681
can for three minutes and let's see.
Because after three minutes then of 

1663
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:46,870
course I'm in better shape and you are 
not training so much.

1664
01:21:46,871 --> 01:21:50,170
So I don't want that to be an issue.
And uh,

1665
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:55,230
when we train man,
he got me in like a minute and a half 

1666
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:56,470
and I was so pissed.
Come in with a foot lock and I was like,

1667
01:21:56,471 --> 01:21:57,100
yeah,
all right.

1668
01:21:57,101 --> 01:21:57,790
He's still the man

1669
01:21:59,170 --> 01:21:59,790
that was the last

1670
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,050
family we really rolled.
So,

1671
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:02,940
um,
yeah,

1672
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,770
I mean he's a,
he's a very.

1673
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:10,120
I mean he's just a real Samurai.
You mean you didn't know where they put 

1674
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:10,120
it?
He's just all around.

1675
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:10,980
It's not an act,
you know,

1676
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:14,760
he's definitely in his bones.
He's ready to die today.

1677
01:22:14,761 --> 01:22:19,761
If something happened,
you'd be ready to die for what he 

1678
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:19,761
believes in.
And I think that's why I,

1679
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,240
I believe in what he says and I believe 
in what I do and why I do what I do with

1680
01:22:24,241 --> 01:22:24,930
so much passion.

1681
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:26,290
Yeah.
He's the real deal.

1682
01:22:26,291 --> 01:22:28,840
And for folks who you want to get a 
sense of it immediately,

1683
01:22:28,841 --> 01:22:31,120
even if you're not a martial artists,
the movie choke,

1684
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:33,300
go watch the movie choke because that's,
you know,

1685
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:38,310
Hixon when he was,
I mean essentially not quite as prime 

1686
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,080
because he was in his late thirties at 
the time.

1687
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:44,081
It was probably,
it was better when he was even younger 

1688
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:45,400
than that.
But you get a chance to see the physical

1689
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:50,401
preparation when he's sitting up to his 
neck in an ice glacial river and 

1690
01:22:50,801 --> 01:22:55,801
meditating.
I mean fucking freezing cold water and 

1691
01:22:55,801 --> 01:22:57,110
he's just breathing and concentrating.
Ace Hoyle,

1692
01:22:57,130 --> 01:22:59,050
he gets in,
he gets his foot and he's like,

1693
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:04,051
fuck this.
Everybody else is like touching the 

1694
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:04,051
water and go,
oh,

1695
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:07,450
this is crazy.
Your Dad's in there up to his head.

1696
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:08,800
Like,
like,

1697
01:23:08,801 --> 01:23:10,860
it's nothing like he's in the Jacuzzi.
So yeah,

1698
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,580
I'm.
That inspires me,

1699
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:13,150
you know,
and I.

1700
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:15,840
Well I remember him getting out,
you know,

1701
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:20,100
happy and praising and thank you.
My Lord are loving it.

1702
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:24,340
The know he embraces the challenge of it
and the braces.

1703
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:29,341
Just the wildness of being in a,
in a glacier river and Japan and the 

1704
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:30,400
whole deal,
man.

1705
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:32,260
Yeah,
he really does it.

1706
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,320
Now.
You are starting to,

1707
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:38,870
you're doing a lot of training with.
I know Gilbert Melendez,

1708
01:23:38,871 --> 01:23:43,871
he's a good friend of yours who 
thankfully just got reassigned to a new 

1709
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:46,060
deal where he's going to compete against
Anthony Pettis,

1710
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:49,810
who's the lightweight champion.
They're gonna fight after they coach the

1711
01:23:49,811 --> 01:23:51,970
ultimate fighter together,
which is a huge thing.

1712
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:57,260
Um,
and you're training with a lot of the 

1713
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:58,440
other oil or get out outta you.
Had enough ever folks who don't know,

1714
01:23:58,441 --> 01:23:59,350
you know,
toilet Gracie,

1715
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,890
so one of the greatest submission 
artists of all time to and very,

1716
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,980
very successful in competition.
So you know,

1717
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:11,250
when you see the difference between how 
a Hixon deals with it and how heuler 

1718
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:14,490
deals,
but that's when you really get a sense 

1719
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:15,340
of what a special person he has.
And by the way,

1720
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:20,341
no one's telling him to do this.
This is all his idea in your mom's 

1721
01:24:20,341 --> 01:24:20,341
calling.
Oh fuck.

1722
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:21,820
Yeah.
And my dad never had it

1723
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,840
coach either,
you know,

1724
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,910
he never really had nobody there all the
time.

1725
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:27,730
Time.
So that gave me more motivation to.

1726
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,880
And also it gave him the confidence that
he could let me be on my own and,

1727
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:35,020
and I was still going to be all right if
I was trying to be all right.

1728
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:39,240
Now what I was going to say is you,
you've done quite a bit of training with

1729
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:44,241
Nick and Nick Diaz and Ronda Rousey.
Did you do some training with her as 

1730
01:24:44,241 --> 01:24:45,070
well?
I've never trained with Rhonda actually.

1731
01:24:45,071 --> 01:24:45,120
Yeah.

1732
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:50,170
Um,
I've trained with Nick and nate a lot 

1733
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:50,170
and Gilbert and jake quite a lot,
you know,

1734
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:54,710
so those guys are a big part of my 
training and I've helped him out all out

1735
01:24:54,711 --> 01:24:55,520
with fights and

1736
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,550
Rhonda trends with those guys on a 
fairly regular basis.

1737
01:24:58,551 --> 01:24:59,780
Right.
She's trained with them a few times.

1738
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:02,480
She definitely was up there more before,
I think.

1739
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:03,980
I don't know how much she goes up there 
now.

1740
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:06,320
But are you planning on fighting and MMA
now?

1741
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:06,740
Yeah,

1742
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,340
I am.
So I actually,

1743
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:14,430
after the ADCC I kind of,
I'm kind of starting to focus more on 

1744
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:19,351
mma,
kind of want my energy to be driven 

1745
01:25:19,351 --> 01:25:19,590
towards fighting professionally and in 
man.

1746
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:25,960
Yeah.
That's where my energy is going these 

1747
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,350
days.
And what motivates you to want to do 

1748
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:28,350
that?
Like I said before,

1749
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:31,531
this has been my.
I knew I was going to get to this point 

1750
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:34,171
when I was a little kid.
I never saw Jujitsu is my final mission 

1751
01:25:34,241 --> 01:25:39,241
and um,
I was just waiting for a right time and 

1752
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:42,161
reading for myself to be ready for 
whatever obstacles I can get to on this 

1753
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:47,850
specific situation.
So now I feel mentally ready and now I 

1754
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:49,810
feel the motivation and now if you would
ask me when I was 20 years old,

1755
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:50,740
if I was ready to fire me,
I,

1756
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,590
I wasn't mentally,
not physically,

1757
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:58,591
not technically,
but just mentally ready to do something 

1758
01:25:58,591 --> 01:25:58,591
like that.

1759
01:25:58,591 --> 01:26:00,700
So the last thing I wanted was to be 
traumatized.

1760
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,650
And uh,
now I feel like no matter what happens,

1761
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,710
I'm ready to,
to,

1762
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,060
to embrace whatever it happens and I'm 
ready to fight.

1763
01:26:08,061 --> 01:26:12,300
So negotiating scene with the best 
situation for me to,

1764
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:15,090
to take advantage of this moment.
Now,

1765
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:17,960
how have you adjusted your training to 
prepare for mixed martial arts?

1766
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:20,960
Some minor,
some minor adjustments.

1767
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,230
Nothing too crazy,
but I think of course you go.

1768
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:30,300
There's different obstacles and 
different things that you got to worry 

1769
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:30,300
about when you're just dealing with 
rigid soon when you're just dealing with

1770
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,460
mma,
you know,

1771
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:34,980
of course you can hit and stuff,
but I think generally my fights,

1772
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,140
the way I fight is,
is more of a fight and I,

1773
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:39,870
I kind of,
not a sport,

1774
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,290
I'm not trying to be sporty with my 
Jujitsu,

1775
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:47,090
so I don't think the transfer over will 
be that big of a jump as it could be for

1776
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:49,640
some other guys.
People who more points oriented,

1777
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:51,810
people who are kind of.
They want to stay in their columns.

1778
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:55,370
I'm very comfortable in the,
in the storm.

1779
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:57,260
So,
um,

1780
01:26:57,560 --> 01:26:59,600
I think that'll help me when I,
when I fight.

1781
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:04,840
That's something.
One of the most important attitudes to 

1782
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,491
have in life is to embrace the storm 
you're comfortable in the store and try 

1783
01:27:06,491 --> 01:27:08,480
to figure out how to make yourself 
uncomfortable all the time.

1784
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,280
There's always time for relaxation after
that.

1785
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:13,490
It's all over,
but don't avoid the storm

1786
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:19,170
that's going to make you really asking.
Then you're going to see who you are 

1787
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:19,720
when you can deal,
how you react in those situations.

1788
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,780
Absolutely.
Especially if you embrace it,

1789
01:27:21,810 --> 01:27:26,000
it becomes a part of who you are as a 
human being that you do that,

1790
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:28,930
that you take on those challenges.
What about striking?

1791
01:27:28,931 --> 01:27:30,370
What are you doing as far as striking?

1792
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,820
I'm working on and a little bit here and
there.

1793
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,430
Um,
you know,

1794
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,210
don't want to give up too much of my 
training.

1795
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,210
But uh,
yeah,

1796
01:27:39,211 --> 01:27:41,550
I mean,
I think Jujitsu has striking,

1797
01:27:41,551 --> 01:27:42,390
you know,
there is,

1798
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:45,960
it's just Jujitsu strikes when it's 
beneficial for you.

1799
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:49,680
It doesn't teach you to sit there in the
pocket and just bang out with anybody.

1800
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:55,280
But if a striking is definitely a part 
of Jujitsu and I think it's going to be 

1801
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,800
interesting to see what I can do,
you know,

1802
01:27:57,870 --> 01:27:59,960
I'm curious and I,
and I'm,

1803
01:28:00,870 --> 01:28:02,320
I want to,
I want to see what,

1804
01:28:02,321 --> 01:28:03,060
what happens,
you know,

1805
01:28:03,061 --> 01:28:08,061
so just like anybody else,
I'm very curious to see how much you do 

1806
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:09,150
digital is going to play in fighting and
how,

1807
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:15,340
what's going to happen?
Is the Jujitsu going to be enough or is 

1808
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,290
he going to have to do this certain type
of training?

1809
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,270
So I think,
uh,

1810
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,030
my training with nick,
nate and,

1811
01:28:20,031 --> 01:28:24,300
and Jake and Gilbert is sufficient to,
to really put me wherever I want to be.

1812
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:25,730
Now your,
your,

1813
01:28:25,731 --> 01:28:29,120
um,
your uncle who is said recently,

1814
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:34,170
you know,
that you don't need anything other than 

1815
01:28:34,170 --> 01:28:36,180
introducer.
Is it all these different people that 

1816
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,430
the train wrestling and all these 
different aspects of striking that you 

1817
01:28:38,430 --> 01:28:39,630
really don't need it just trained 
Jujitsu.

1818
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:44,700
Do you,
do you agree with that or do you think 

1819
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:45,830
that in modern mixed martial arts it is 
important that you cross train?

1820
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,840
It is important that you prepare for 
full mixed martial arts competition or 

1821
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,910
do you think that the highest level of 
Jujitsu is still sufficient fish

1822
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:55,220
it,
I think Jujitsu is sufficient.

1823
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,840
I think it's sufficient to be the best 
martial arts.

1824
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,200
I just think that rule is make it so 
that it's not necessarily possible.

1825
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,480
So the rounds,
the gloves,

1826
01:29:06,510 --> 01:29:08,280
the rules,
you know,

1827
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:12,180
those things all change the sport and it
changes the situation.

1828
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,380
Standups,
yeah.

1829
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:18,381
Like if you have no gloves,
nobody's going to be throwing those 

1830
01:29:18,381 --> 01:29:22,080
punches that guys throw these days.
So you're going to break your hand first

1831
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:22,800
punch,
you throw the guy,

1832
01:29:22,801 --> 01:29:23,960
ducks his head,
you're going to break your hands.

1833
01:29:23,961 --> 01:29:28,190
So I think that all those things change 
it and when it changes,

1834
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:31,320
you have to be ready to adapt to what 
changes personally.

1835
01:29:31,321 --> 01:29:35,370
If you put two guys in a cage in Jujitsu
is enough,

1836
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:40,400
but when you put on the gloves and you 
put the time and you put the rounds and 

1837
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:40,400
you put the,
you know,

1838
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:43,020
all these things,
the steroids,

1839
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:48,120
so it changes the situation and,
and you know,

1840
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:53,810
guys are more willing to just throw the 
hardest punches and knock you out 

1841
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:57,830
because they know that the round is 
going to end because they know that 

1842
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:57,830
their hands not necessarily going to 
break.

1843
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:59,730
So if you asked me what's the best 
martial arts,

1844
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:00,840
I think judy who?
Of course,

1845
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:04,200
if you ask me what is digital enough?
Yes.

1846
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,760
It just depends on the rules.
If you tell me,

1847
01:30:05,761 --> 01:30:10,761
okay,
it's a two minute round and the guy is 

1848
01:30:10,761 --> 01:30:10,761
gonna stand you up,
or do you know?

1849
01:30:10,761 --> 01:30:12,780
Of course then you have to learn how to 
box.

1850
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:17,781
You have to learn how to do this,
and personally I'm deflection of punches

1851
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,110
is always been a part of Jew to be not 
necessarily being able to strike.

1852
01:30:22,530 --> 01:30:24,780
I don't know necessarily if I'm gonna be
knocking guys out,

1853
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:28,810
but I'm going to be able to defend my 
goal into the Jujitsu.

1854
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:33,830
Go in.
The principle is to be able to defend 

1855
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:33,830
whatever the guy's gonna do.
If the guy's going to punch you,

1856
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:38,571
you have to be able to defend the punch.
You have to be so I don't necessarily 

1857
01:30:38,571 --> 01:30:41,481
think that you have to be a great 
striker to to win mma and to be a champ,

1858
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:44,700
but you have to be able to defend 
yourself.

1859
01:30:44,701 --> 01:30:47,040
You have to be able to know where the 
punch is coming from.

1860
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,540
You have to be able to know what's going
on.

1861
01:30:48,541 --> 01:30:50,820
You have to know about stuff.
It's not like,

1862
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:55,850
oh,
Guy Trained Jujitsu for 20 years and 

1863
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:55,850
then he goes into a fight.
He's going to get,

1864
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,160
he's going to get beat up,
you know,

1865
01:30:56,220 --> 01:31:01,220
so it depends how you train and what 
your worry is and how well you adapt to

1866
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,910
whatever's going on in the fight.
Your Dad always said that,

1867
01:31:04,911 --> 01:31:09,911
that he doesn't train kickboxing to 
become a kickboxer transit to know what 

1868
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:09,911
they're doing.
Yes,

1869
01:31:09,911 --> 01:31:11,810
exactly.
So I feel comfortable.

1870
01:31:11,811 --> 01:31:15,770
So who were you talking to?
Are you talking to organizations?

1871
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:16,760
Can you tell me?
Uh,

1872
01:31:16,761 --> 01:31:17,230
yeah,
I'm,

1873
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,140
I'm talking to right now.
I'm negotiating with Japan.

1874
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:26,141
Nothing's for sure,
but it's looking good and I'm trying to 

1875
01:31:26,141 --> 01:31:28,130
see if I can get a,
there's an opportunity for me in Japan.

1876
01:31:28,131 --> 01:31:30,500
So what organizations are left in Japan 
right now?

1877
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:33,500
Don't,
can't really say too much right now,

1878
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:37,230
but basically it's very shortly we'll,
we'll know going

1879
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:38,880
on with that.
And uh,

1880
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:40,630
well for folks who don't know,
your,

1881
01:31:40,680 --> 01:31:42,990
your dad was a huge star in Japan.
Yeah,

1882
01:31:43,030 --> 01:31:48,030
they had a comic book based on them.
I mean there was a lot of fanfare and 

1883
01:31:48,030 --> 01:31:50,370
publicity and they,
they embraced him,

1884
01:31:50,371 --> 01:31:52,950
especially when he won the Japan valley.
Tudos,

1885
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,940
I mean,
your dad was an enormous star over there

1886
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:02,030
and I think that,
that sense that you would want to 

1887
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:03,100
compete over there because they would be
very interested to see.

1888
01:32:03,410 --> 01:32:08,410
Yeah,
there's a lot of benefits for me 

1889
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:08,410
starting off in Japan and,
and uh,

1890
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:13,090
you know,
the just a lot better for me at this 

1891
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,690
moment in my career to start off in 
Japan into,

1892
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:19,720
to really build myself the best I can.
And I personally like fighting in front 

1893
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:22,550
of Japanese culture because,
you know,

1894
01:32:22,551 --> 01:32:23,210
they're,
they're,

1895
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:25,940
they're a little bit more martial 
artists.

1896
01:32:25,941 --> 01:32:27,330
They come from like a Samurai 
background,

1897
01:32:27,331 --> 01:32:32,331
so they really care about what you are,
they really care about what you stand 

1898
01:32:32,331 --> 01:32:32,331
for,
they really care about,

1899
01:32:32,331 --> 01:32:34,730
um,
if you sweep somebody in the middle of a

1900
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:35,510
tournament,
they're going to clap,

1901
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,100
you know.
So personally for me,

1902
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,670
I,
I appreciate that and I liked that about

1903
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:46,870
Japan and um,
I think it's just a time in my life and 

1904
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,570
of course,
if Japan were to ever like,

1905
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,730
you know,
have a movement of,

1906
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,760
of,
of being able to bring mma back to 

1907
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:58,661
Japan.
I think a possibility will be with 

1908
01:32:58,661 --> 01:33:01,270
bringing me to it because that's gonna.
It's of replicate what my dad did.

1909
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:04,040
You know,
how he brought it to Japan.

1910
01:33:04,041 --> 01:33:06,770
So I think it's,
for me in this situation,

1911
01:33:06,771 --> 01:33:11,771
it's,
it's a great opportunity and I'm trying 

1912
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:11,771
to go for that.

1913
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:11,771
Yeah.
For people who don't know,

1914
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:15,860
your dad was the star of pride one.
I mean that's what got pride kicked off.

1915
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:16,940
That was the,
uh,

1916
01:33:16,941 --> 01:33:21,520
the big launching pad after he had won 
the Japan Valley Tudo.

1917
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:25,600
And then of course pride came close to 
me.

1918
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:30,670
It was an enormous event in Japan,
like they had put on 90,000

1919
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,990
seat shows several times

1920
01:33:33,270 --> 01:33:35,970
60,000
Tokyo dome sold out huge.

1921
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:41,210
And somehow or another it stopped.
It's one of the great mysteries of 

1922
01:33:41,881 --> 01:33:45,690
martial arts and I don't totally 
understand Japanese culture.

1923
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:50,280
I guess they get really into things 
sometimes and then the things fade away.

1924
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:55,640
But uh,
when we were there and we did the UFC 

1925
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,891
there a couple of years ago,
it was my first time in Japan and I was 

1926
01:33:57,891 --> 01:33:57,891
amazed that the audiences,
they were awesome.

1927
01:33:57,891 --> 01:33:59,490
They are amazing.
Like when the fights going on,

1928
01:33:59,491 --> 01:34:04,491
they're so polite and then when 
something happens like a transition or 

1929
01:34:04,491 --> 01:34:04,670
sweep,
everybody applauds.

1930
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,760
Like it's like,
wow,

1931
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,370
there's like,
it's really cool.

1932
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,400
It's like I,
I really appreciate how much they love 

1933
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:17,520
the,
the technique and the martial arts 

1934
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:17,520
aspect of it.
But as far as like a crazy crowd,

1935
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,000
there's nothing like Brazil.
There is nothing like Brazil.

1936
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:23,970
This last event when Machida fought most
saucy,

1937
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:26,140
I watched it at home.
And uh,

1938
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:31,190
when,
when Bruce Buffer says it's time to 

1939
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,700
whole audience does it with them.
I mean there's like 18,000

1940
01:34:32,701 --> 01:34:33,120
people.

1941
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,670
No one cheers.
Like a Brazilian crowd.

1942
01:34:38,671 --> 01:34:43,671
No one cheers.
And they're there at the very first 

1943
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:43,671
fight.
That place is packed,

1944
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:45,420
packed.
They're getting their money's worth.

1945
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:46,470
Fuck.
Yeah.

1946
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,180
Fucking fired up,
man.

1947
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:53,420
We got there early and there was already
just a giant line around the block to 

1948
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,750
the arena.
And then when we got in it,

1949
01:34:54,751 --> 01:34:56,940
man,
the energy in the air was it,

1950
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,460
it was a huge,
huge,

1951
01:34:58,461 --> 01:35:03,461
huge thing.
That was the last one that I was at in 

1952
01:35:03,461 --> 01:35:03,461
Rio.
But um,

1953
01:35:03,461 --> 01:35:05,720
there's no crowds like Brazilian crowds.
The Japanese soccer,

1954
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:09,110
they come from the soccer backgrounds,
so they're really into that.

1955
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:13,100
Japanese crowds are just different in 
their own way.

1956
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,110
Completely different.
Very,

1957
01:35:15,111 --> 01:35:16,640
very different from the Brazilian 
crowds,

1958
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:20,440
but different in their own unique way.
So does.

1959
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,490
Is there a timeline on when this is 
going to happen?

1960
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:25,180
Basically we're going to know very soon,
very,

1961
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:29,250
very soon in the next.
Probably the next time I see you.

1962
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:34,960
It will be you.
I'll have an answer and so I'm just 

1963
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,301
waiting.
I don't want to give up a date or a 

1964
01:35:38,301 --> 01:35:39,621
time.
I don't want to put too much energy 

1965
01:35:39,621 --> 01:35:41,091
into,
into that because I hope it happens so 

1966
01:35:41,091 --> 01:35:41,460
much that I don't want to spoil 
anything.

1967
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:44,070
So see.
And it's going to happen very soon.

1968
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,720
So I'll let you know.
I'll let you know.

1969
01:35:45,721 --> 01:35:46,860
Don't worry,
be able to.

1970
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:49,830
Did you watch the UFC this weekend?
I did not.

1971
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,380
I just missed it.
Damian Maya,

1972
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:56,100
who is a very excellent representative 
of Jujitsu,

1973
01:35:56,130 --> 01:36:00,260
fought Rory Macdonald and got beat up.
Who,

1974
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:02,130
what happened in the fight?
Well,

1975
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:04,830
Damien took them down the first round of
mounted him,

1976
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,370
but uh,
he couldn't submit them.

1977
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:10,800
And Rory defended,
got back up to his feet and then started

1978
01:36:10,801 --> 01:36:13,280
kicking the shit out really.
And was Damien just trying to

1979
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,180
stand up with him?
Yeah,

1980
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,960
yeah.
Well there you go.

1981
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:20,140
I mean,
I like Damien.

1982
01:36:20,141 --> 01:36:22,000
Damien is a,
a good guy,

1983
01:36:22,001 --> 01:36:22,850
you know,
and he's like,

1984
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:27,851
uh,
I've always had respect for him and 

1985
01:36:27,851 --> 01:36:27,851
we've always had a good time 
relationship.

1986
01:36:27,851 --> 01:36:29,860
Um,
and he's always been a representative of

1987
01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:32,900
Jujitsu in a great way.
Um,

1988
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,270
so I think the more he,
he focuses on that and the more he tries

1989
01:36:37,271 --> 01:36:39,850
to really use the J to,
the better he's going to be because he's

1990
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:42,370
a specialist in Jujitsu.
He's not a specialist in striking.

1991
01:36:42,371 --> 01:36:47,371
So it's tough to,
to try to be an excellent person in a 

1992
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:50,160
different sport.
I think he should try to focus in on,

1993
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:55,240
on,
on being the greatest Jujitsu fighter 

1994
01:36:55,240 --> 01:36:56,680
and an iron man.
I think that'll be beneficial for him.

1995
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:58,880
Well,
he was trying to do that.

1996
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:01,550
I mean he was trying down but he 
couldn't take them down.

1997
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:03,560
So then they're getting his take down 
stuffed.

1998
01:37:03,561 --> 01:37:06,080
And then he was forced to stand with 
them and rory kept kicking him.

1999
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:07,610
He was just kicking the shit out of him.

2000
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:08,880
That's why I'm curious,
you know,

2001
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:12,050
I'm curious to see for myself how it is,
you know,

2002
01:37:12,090 --> 01:37:17,090
fighting with guys who don't want to go 
to the ground and see how I'm going to 

2003
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:17,090
be able to deal with it and I don't 
know.

2004
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:19,920
I have zero experience in mma so I'm 
curious.

2005
01:37:19,921 --> 01:37:24,921
I'm curious to see what happens and I'm 
curious to see how really difficult it 

2006
01:37:24,921 --> 01:37:28,071
can be and where my,
where my technique is going to play a 

2007
01:37:28,071 --> 01:37:28,510
role in how it's going to be because you
never know.

2008
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:31,840
That's why I'm,
I'm really open for the,

2009
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,960
for the challenge.
And you know,

2010
01:37:33,961 --> 01:37:34,470
my,
my,

2011
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,250
my blessings for,
for Damien,

2012
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:42,290
hopefully he can find a great tactic to 
beat his opponents and be guys who are 

2013
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:42,290
trying to do that.

2014
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:47,540
Do you look at him as sort of A.
I mean he's a very high level Jujitsu 

2015
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:47,540
God,
you look at him and as,

2016
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:52,040
as an example of what can be possible 
and not the pitfalls and the 

2017
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:52,290
possibilities.

2018
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:57,640
Yeah,
I mean I think if somebody can defend 

2019
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:59,990
his takedowns to something,
then there's definitely a technical 

2020
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:02,361
reason why that's happening.
And I think that like personally I 

2021
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:04,050
admire the guy,
the guy's a,

2022
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,690
an exceptional athlete and he's a great 
fighter and hear everything,

2023
01:38:06,691 --> 01:38:11,691
but I don't look up to his Jujitsu.
I don't look up to anybody that you did 

2024
01:38:12,541 --> 01:38:15,540
to that is fighting these days,
you know,

2025
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:19,650
I don't like seeing anything that,
that is exceptional,

2026
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:21,120
you know,
I see guys that are good,

2027
01:38:21,121 --> 01:38:25,470
tough and guys who make it happen.
But I'm impressed with my dad's Jujitsu.

2028
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,100
That's where I feel like I'm going to 
try to replicate.

2029
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:33,930
So as much as I'm a,
I'm a fan and admired and all these guys

2030
01:38:33,931 --> 01:38:34,740
are,
they made,

2031
01:38:34,741 --> 01:38:37,080
they got to where they got with the 
tools that they were given,

2032
01:38:37,410 --> 01:38:39,510
you know,
we are all given certain amount of tools

2033
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:44,511
and how will you use them?
So I can't take anything away from the 

2034
01:38:44,511 --> 01:38:45,990
guys who got far with the Jujitsu 
striking or with whatever.

2035
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:49,530
But um,
yeah,

2036
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:53,400
it's definitely like you're going to be 
able to see,

2037
01:38:53,401 --> 01:38:53,670
you know,

2038
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
who do you think is the best 
representative of Jujitsu right now in 

2039
01:38:59,000 --> 01:38:59,000
mixed martial arts?

2040
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,360
Uh,
I mean,

2041
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:01,590
there's a lot,
a lot of good guys,

2042
01:39:01,591 --> 01:39:02,280
you know,
there's,

2043
01:39:02,370 --> 01:39:03,660
you know,
the classics,

2044
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:03,990
you know,
like,

2045
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:05,410
Damien's very good.
You know,

2046
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:07,440
Jack is very good.
Those guys are guys who,

2047
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:12,441
I have friends with,
guys who have been competing in 

2048
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:12,441
tournaments in

2049
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:13,530
Sergio Mariah's to his Jujitsu.
I mean,

2050
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,340
he hasn't gotten to that level yet.
Uh,

2051
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,110
you know,
the,

2052
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:21,111
the level of opposition yet.
But his Jujitsu has been very effective 

2053
01:39:21,111 --> 01:39:21,111
in mma.
His,

2054
01:39:21,111 --> 01:39:22,370
uh,
his submissions or uh,

2055
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:22,820
you know,

2056
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:25,850
I actually haven't seen him fight really
in MMA,

2057
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:30,880
so I don't really know too much.
But his Jujitsu and Jujitsu tournament 

2058
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:30,880
is,
is,

2059
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:31,520
is good.
You know,

2060
01:39:31,521 --> 01:39:34,670
he's a tough guy.
He has a specific type of style.

2061
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,240
But again,
I'm not impressed with his Jujitsu,

2062
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:40,180
you know,
like I'm impressed with him as a,

2063
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,250
as a whole,
you know,

2064
01:39:41,270 --> 01:39:41,990
he's like,
oh,

2065
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,030
the guy can make it happen.
He can defend.

2066
01:39:44,031 --> 01:39:46,220
Well,
he's an exceptional athlete.

2067
01:39:46,221 --> 01:39:48,800
The guy is very strong,
very explosive,

2068
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:54,520
but you know,
I don't see him as an exceptional 

2069
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:57,520
Jujitsu fighter.
What's missing for him personally?

2070
01:39:57,710 --> 01:39:58,340
Yeah.
I mean,

2071
01:39:59,390 --> 01:39:59,960
again,
like,

2072
01:39:59,961 --> 01:40:00,350
I don't know.

2073
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,160
No,
but when you say,

2074
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:06,180
I mean you look at a guy who was like a 
high level world champion caliber 

2075
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:09,011
fighter,
but you say you're not impressed with 

2076
01:40:09,011 --> 01:40:09,011
his Jujitsu.
What is not impressive about it?

2077
01:40:09,011 --> 01:40:12,890
Um,
uh,

2078
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,850
I don't know because I had never seen 
him fighting MMA,

2079
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:17,460
so I don't know what he's doing in mma,
but when I fight him,

2080
01:40:17,461 --> 01:40:22,461
I fought him once he beat my ass and 
then I fought him the next time and it 

2081
01:40:22,461 --> 01:40:24,930
was a very even match.
I thought I won that match and I got.

2082
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:27,110
I felt like I got gypped.
But

2083
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:32,220
did they give him an advantage?
It gave them an advantage of the last 

2084
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,370
five seconds is so squirrely for folks 
who don't know.

2085
01:40:33,371 --> 01:40:37,210
There's weird scoring and Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is zero to zero.

2086
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,470
One guy can get what they call an 
advantage and it's very subjective.

2087
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:42,940
And uh,
you know,

2088
01:40:42,941 --> 01:40:47,800
people I've seen fucking bench clearing 
brawls because of a advantage scoring.

2089
01:40:47,900 --> 01:40:52,900
What I feel about impressive Jujitsu is 
why am I so impressed with my dad's got 

2090
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,020
to,
is because he outsmarts me.

2091
01:40:56,380 --> 01:41:01,380
He technically beat me.
If somebody is stronger than me and they

2092
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:06,720
pass my guard or they submit me,
I am not impressed because of that.

2093
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,950
I think that the guy used this tool to 
beat me or did whatever too.

2094
01:41:11,380 --> 01:41:13,210
But that doesn't mean he's a better 
Jujitsu.

2095
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:16,930
Doesn't technically a impressed me.
So,

2096
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:19,270
um,
it's very difficult to impress me.

2097
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:24,271
I come from my father.
My Dad has been technically outsmarting 

2098
01:41:24,271 --> 01:41:27,001
me for a long time,
so it's hard for me to be impressed 

2099
01:41:27,001 --> 01:41:29,071
with,
with Jujitsu these days and that's what 

2100
01:41:29,071 --> 01:41:31,951
I am trying to do.
I'm trying to do that is technical and 

2101
01:41:31,951 --> 01:41:36,330
it's way harder for you to technically 
outsmart somebody then for you to just 

2102
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:37,690
know I'm going to get it and just take 
it and the guy defends and then you just

2103
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:38,470
rip right through it.

2104
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:42,220
So it's a different approach to what I 
believe digital is about.

2105
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,750
And that's why I feel like I'm not 
impressed as much as other people or how

2106
01:41:46,751 --> 01:41:48,820
they see he got that arm bar.
Yeah.

2107
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:53,990
But,
but he got an arm bar because he's much 

2108
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:53,990
stronger than the guy.
The guy has no defense.

2109
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:56,950
And so I feel like it's a mind game and 
however,

2110
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:59,470
well you use your chest pieces,
you know,

2111
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:02,290
that's what's gonna make you the 
results.

2112
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:04,080
But I don't take anything away from 
surgery.

2113
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:04,750
Mariah's,
he's a,

2114
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:08,740
he's a great fighter and he's an 
exceptionally healthy,

2115
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:13,741
strong person and he's able to use the 
tools and he's able to use Jujitsu for 

2116
01:42:13,741 --> 01:42:17,251
his benefit.
That doesn't mean he's not good at 

2117
01:42:17,251 --> 01:42:19,591
Jujitsu or anything.
That just means that if you speak 

2118
01:42:19,591 --> 01:42:19,690
specifically for Jujitsu,
is he,

2119
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:25,110
is he using his strength or is he using 
his technical ability to,

2120
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:28,810
to beat your opponent?
And that's where I say that.

2121
01:42:28,811 --> 01:42:32,430
That's why I say that Mark Coleman wants
certainly share this.

2122
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:35,710
That was the match that I draw with 
them.

2123
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:37,300
He was like four,
four.

2124
01:42:37,301 --> 01:42:38,550
And then,
um,

2125
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,020
I lost on an advantage at the last 
second.

2126
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:43,210
You were rocking the Old School Samurai 
ponytail.

2127
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:47,660
Just try that out for a little bit.
Nobody told me it was really gay,

2128
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:52,430
so he kept going for a little bit.
Your Dad had that back in the day,

2129
01:42:52,431 --> 01:42:53,450
man,
that's a tribute.

2130
01:42:53,451 --> 01:42:55,760
That's attributed haircut.
You'd get a pass.

2131
01:42:56,070 --> 01:43:00,430
You get a gay pass.
When I realized it was really,

2132
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:03,200
so I kinda cut it.
But did he get in the way?

2133
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:08,230
Yeah,
I just got in the way and it just kind 

2134
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:08,230
of wasn't really my style for.
I was for awhile.

2135
01:43:08,230 --> 01:43:12,880
I did.
I had to do with it and then that was 

2136
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,741
it.
I was gonna say that Mark Coleman wants 

2137
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:14,960
told me strength is technique,
strength,

2138
01:43:14,961 --> 01:43:17,660
two technique for some people and that's
for some people they.

2139
01:43:17,661 --> 01:43:19,160
Everybody has their,
their belief,

2140
01:43:19,161 --> 01:43:20,600
other people,
other digital guys.

2141
01:43:20,601 --> 01:43:21,920
They're like,
you know,

2142
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:25,370
if the movie doesn't work then use more 
strength.

2143
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:30,730
You know,
if the moves don't work because you're 

2144
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:30,730
not using enough strength.
So I'm not.

2145
01:43:30,730 --> 01:43:33,380
I don't come from that theory.
I don't come from that belief and I come

2146
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,420
from a leverage and technique 
background.

2147
01:43:35,421 --> 01:43:40,421
So that's why I feel the way I feel.
It's not because I feel against anybody 

2148
01:43:40,421 --> 01:43:44,741
and I'm not trying to point fingers or,
or try to say that I'm better than 

2149
01:43:44,741 --> 01:43:44,741
anybody,
nothing like that.

2150
01:43:44,741 --> 01:43:49,420
I still have a lot to prove,
but if you honestly ask me if I'm 

2151
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,010
impressed with the Jujitsu I come from,
I'm picking son,

2152
01:43:52,011 --> 01:43:52,430
you know,
I,

2153
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:56,060
I come from the best.
If I'm easily impressed,

2154
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:57,220
you know,
that's not a good sign.

2155
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:00,730
Who impresses you in Jujitsu today?
Um,

2156
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:04,820
what really impresses me is guys who are
smaller,

2157
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,790
being able to really defeat bigger 
opponents like Marcella Garcia.

2158
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:11,330
My celebration is a very,
he's definitely a great fighter.

2159
01:44:11,331 --> 01:44:16,331
You know,
I fought him twice and he's one guy who 

2160
01:44:16,331 --> 01:44:16,460
technically is great,
you know,

2161
01:44:16,461 --> 01:44:19,100
like I have nothing to say about his 
technical abilities and he's,

2162
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,010
he's technically in the game,
you know,

2163
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:27,011
he's not overpower.
He's not using his physical attributes 

2164
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:27,410
to beat his opponent.
So I'm impressed with that.

2165
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:29,060
That's,
that's a great thing that he has.

2166
01:44:29,061 --> 01:44:31,730
And um,
yeah,

2167
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:35,540
I mean the technical ability is where I 
feel like is the line for,

2168
01:44:35,570 --> 01:44:36,710
for,
for greatness.

2169
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:38,780
And then,
yeah,

2170
01:44:38,781 --> 01:44:39,720
Marcella Garcia,
he's,

2171
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:40,850
he's great.
I,

2172
01:44:40,990 --> 01:44:42,710
I love,
I love fighting him,

2173
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:47,830
you know,
that's one guy who I will fight any day 

2174
01:44:47,830 --> 01:44:50,550
that it's great to be meshing with that 
kind of talent.

2175
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:53,520
So,
um,

2176
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:56,650
yeah,
he's a great example and he fought,

2177
01:44:56,651 --> 01:45:00,200
guys were really big and right there.
I almost got him,

2178
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:05,590
Marcella had him in a guillotine for,
for good minute until my forums cramped 

2179
01:45:06,351 --> 01:45:06,500
up.

2180
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,400
But um,

2181
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:14,630
if there was a professional avenue for 
Jujitsu of Jujitsu was like golf or 

2182
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:16,640
baseball or something like that.
It was on television all the time.

2183
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:20,600
Would you be motivated at all to enter 
into MMA?

2184
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:22,990
Um,
yeah,

2185
01:45:22,991 --> 01:45:27,820
I think so too because I think it's more
of a real fight and I think it's more of

2186
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:30,680
a challenge and I like challenges and I 
like to,

2187
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:36,400
I like to challenge and I like to see 
what's going to happen.

2188
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:41,640
And personally I think that Jujitsu 
takes away a little bit from the full 

2189
01:45:41,681 --> 01:45:46,681
fighting for fighting because it's 
punching because there's no punching in 

2190
01:45:48,791 --> 01:45:51,160
because there's other tools.
So the less rules you have,

2191
01:45:51,790 --> 01:45:56,790
the more you can actually present 
yourself in and use the stuff that you 

2192
01:45:57,641 --> 01:45:58,390
have within,
you know,

2193
01:45:58,391 --> 01:46:03,391
the fighting spirit and find out ways to
stay safe and in personally digits,

2194
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,180
who most of the Jujitsu these days are 
very boring matches and they're very,

2195
01:46:07,181 --> 01:46:09,920
you know,
point oriented and they,

2196
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:11,650
they,
they kind of,

2197
01:46:11,980 --> 01:46:12,960
you know,
it's,

2198
01:46:13,030 --> 01:46:16,600
it's not as interesting to watch because
guys are not really,

2199
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:21,150
they're there for the wind for the point
and um,

2200
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:23,070
it's not motivating for me,
you know,

2201
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:26,620
it's not motivating for me to compete in
a fight like that.

2202
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:32,190
I'm motivated to,
to embark on this new journey of MMA 

2203
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:32,820
motivated to,
to see what happened,

2204
01:46:32,821 --> 01:46:37,821
to see how the fight fight goes,
what I need to do with what happens if 

2205
01:46:37,821 --> 01:46:39,370
this happens.
And I think that's a great thing.

2206
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:40,810
Now when you see guys like Jocko,
right,

2207
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:45,610
who were great Jujitsu artists and now 
entering into mma and just drunk arrays,

2208
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:47,390
winning a lot of his fights with 
kickboxing.

2209
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:49,440
Yeah.
And a lot of guys that he's fighting,

2210
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:54,441
he's not able to take down.
So some sort of forced to stay on this 

2211
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:55,260
track with them.
Would you take away anything from that?

2212
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:57,060
Do you learn anything from that?

2213
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,500
Yeah,
I'm trying to learn.

2214
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:03,560
I think Jakarta is great and I really 
like him a lot as a human being and as 

2215
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:06,580
an athlete I've been his fans and she 
was before,

2216
01:47:06,581 --> 01:47:07,920
you know,
in Jujitsu,

2217
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:11,130
he was always a kind of a real cool guy 
to,

2218
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:14,010
to watch and he's a warrior,
you know,

2219
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:19,011
that guy has a,
has a strong spirit and he's a very 

2220
01:47:19,011 --> 01:47:19,110
strong hearted person.
So,

2221
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:22,050
so whatever he does,
he's going to be good at.

2222
01:47:22,051 --> 01:47:23,600
And however he does it,
he's gonna be,

2223
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:28,020
he's gonna make it happen and he charged
her courage is use the tools that he was

2224
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:31,080
given to to get the best results that he
can get.

2225
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,910
I don't take anything away from him.

2226
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:38,580
Darn it mean by tech.
Do you personally get something from 

2227
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:38,580
watching him?
Like,

2228
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:40,460
dude,
you learn something from his.

2229
01:47:40,490 --> 01:47:42,390
His approach?
Yeah.

2230
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:47,460
Me Personally,
I'm kind of trying to always analyze in 

2231
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,640
more importantly,
I'm trying to see where I fit in on 

2232
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:50,640
this.
You know,

2233
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:53,760
I want to see if it's really,
if how I'm gonna deal with somebody 

2234
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,440
who's not letting me take them down,
how am I going to get them down,

2235
01:47:55,441 --> 01:47:57,520
how am I going to find the way to win 
the fight?

2236
01:47:57,521 --> 01:48:02,521
So I think it's all in the air and we're
going to see what happens and I can't 

2237
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:06,811
wait to start to,
to test myself in these waters and get 

2238
01:48:06,811 --> 01:48:09,220
these challenges and find out ways to 
find out ways to win.

2239
01:48:09,410 --> 01:48:11,930
No,
other than Gill and Jake,

2240
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:13,360
how many wrestlers?
Yeah,

2241
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:13,440
as you're

2242
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,760
working with.
I mean,

2243
01:48:14,770 --> 01:48:19,770
in my academy there's always been great 
wrestlers and great judo guys and great 

2244
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,060
everything.
They all come in and out of my academy.

2245
01:48:22,061 --> 01:48:26,610
So I've wrestled with the best wrestlers
and I've wrestled with uh,

2246
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,560
you know,
I've been in the mix with a lot of great

2247
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:32,980
athletes and um,
yeah,

2248
01:48:32,981 --> 01:48:36,370
I mean they're,
they're,

2249
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,870
they're,
they're a part of the training,

2250
01:48:37,871 --> 01:48:42,871
you know,
they come in and when I go up to train 

2251
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:42,871
with nate or Gilbert,
there's lot of wrestlers.

2252
01:48:42,871 --> 01:48:44,230
And I think that's just one more tool.
One more,

2253
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:46,790
one more training session.
One different types of train,

2254
01:48:46,791 --> 01:48:48,350
sometimes you train just tonight you're 
taking.

2255
01:48:48,351 --> 01:48:49,990
Now sometimes you train to take somebody
down.

2256
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:53,650
Sometimes you just trained Jujitsu.
Sometimes you just train defense.

2257
01:48:53,651 --> 01:48:58,651
Sometimes you just train one position,
so you try to build yourself as a 

2258
01:48:58,661 --> 01:49:00,260
complete as much as you can.

2259
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:03,430
And of course my specialty will never be
wrestling.

2260
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:06,820
My specialty will never be boxing or 
kickboxing.

2261
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:11,050
It's never going to be my specialty,
so I'm just like,

2262
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:16,051
Jack,
his specialty is not going to be stand 

2263
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:16,051
up.
He's great at standup,

2264
01:49:16,051 --> 01:49:17,560
he's knocking guys out,
he's doing great,

2265
01:49:18,130 --> 01:49:20,410
but that's not his specialty.
When you ask him where he feels the best

2266
01:49:20,411 --> 01:49:25,411
is going to be Jujitsu.
So I feel like my best is always going 

2267
01:49:25,411 --> 01:49:29,720
to be Jujitsu as much as I trained the 
other stuff and as much as I feel 

2268
01:49:29,720 --> 01:49:33,150
comfortable in the other place,
I want to bring the fight to where I'm 

2269
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:36,540
where I feel great.
That's why Anderson Silva was champion 

2270
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:40,381
for so long was because he was able to 
keep the fight where he felt 

2271
01:49:40,381 --> 01:49:43,891
comfortable.
He was able to keep the fight on his 

2272
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:43,891
feet and in that,
you know,

2273
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:46,480
elusiveness,
he was able to win if he was like,

2274
01:49:46,481 --> 01:49:51,481
I don't care,
I get taken down and let the guys 

2275
01:49:51,481 --> 01:49:51,481
mountain and do this stuff.

2276
01:49:51,481 --> 01:49:55,080
And then they didn't fight to get up.
Then he would have lost a long time 

2277
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,050
before.
But because he was so well at being able

2278
01:49:56,051 --> 01:50:01,051
to stay in his where he's comfortable at
and keep the fight where he wants to 

2279
01:50:01,051 --> 01:50:03,100
keep it right.
He was an exceptional legend,

2280
01:50:03,101 --> 01:50:03,480
you know,
for,

2281
01:50:03,481 --> 01:50:06,200
for so long and you know,
that's something to admire.

2282
01:50:06,201 --> 01:50:07,490
And,
and I,

2283
01:50:07,491 --> 01:50:10,960
I see guys,
a lot of guys are just just general.

2284
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,760
A lot of guys are just really good at 
everything.

2285
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:17,780
Nobody is a special ed specialist in 
anything and suffer some here and there.

2286
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:21,790
But generally mma is just,
you're just good at everything.

2287
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:25,690
You're not specialized in something.
So I think for me,

2288
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:28,780
coming from a martial arts background,
not coming from an MMA background,

2289
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:32,170
not coming from.
I didn't just start doing this because I

2290
01:50:32,171 --> 01:50:37,171
saw her on TV.
I come from a tradition in my tradition 

2291
01:50:37,171 --> 01:50:41,761
is due to my tradition,
is his technique and leverage and that's

2292
01:50:41,801 --> 01:50:44,920
what I based my whole life on.
So if I'm going to fight,

2293
01:50:44,921 --> 01:50:46,930
I'm going to use that to my benefit.
You know,

2294
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,090
there's one pattern that we do see in 
mma all the time,

2295
01:50:50,091 --> 01:50:54,260
is that when a guy gets truly excellent 
at any one aspect of fighting,

2296
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:59,050
that will always be that advantage when 
it gets into the octagon that it.

2297
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:04,380
It always is a significant advantage 
over people that have never competed in 

2298
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,270
that individual form.
Like,

2299
01:51:06,271 --> 01:51:11,271
like for example,
like if you take a guy like Anderson 

2300
01:51:11,271 --> 01:51:15,340
Silva is a total specialists to stand up
striking specialist being his whole 

2301
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:19,301
career as a standup striking specialists
in order for you to get that good as he 

2302
01:51:19,301 --> 01:51:20,900
was at a whole lifetime.
It's a whole lifetime.

2303
01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:22,370
Yeah.
So that's.

2304
01:51:22,371 --> 01:51:23,260
I don't got to live

2305
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,950
right now.
Do what I got going on.

2306
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,150
Where's your academy?
Where?

2307
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:34,170
Where do you teach?
I teach in Culver City right next to 

2308
01:51:34,170 --> 01:51:34,170
apply to the way a Jefferson and 
centinela.

2309
01:51:34,500 --> 01:51:37,380
It was called the chrome grace home.
Now.

2310
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:41,010
Do you find that teaching makes you 
better at your too?

2311
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,800
Yeah,
I've been teaching since I was 15,

2312
01:51:42,801 --> 01:51:47,801
so everyday I teach even till today I 
still get better and I realized 

2313
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:52,211
something that could be better or 
realize how I can explain something 

2314
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:54,821
better or realize how I can see a 
different side and teaching for me has 

2315
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:58,871
definitely been a huge part of my growth
in Jujitsu and I see people who just 

2316
01:51:58,871 --> 01:52:03,551
trained and don't teach and I see a big 
difference in the people who do cheat 

2317
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:07,391
and how much more knowledgeable they are
and how much better they can be from 

2318
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:07,391
that.

2319
01:52:07,720 --> 01:52:08,590
Yeah,
it's interesting,

2320
01:52:08,591 --> 01:52:13,591
isn't it,
that teaching someone who doesn't know 

2321
01:52:13,591 --> 01:52:14,980
something forces you to think about 
almost every single aspect of it,

2322
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:19,000
including parts of it that you could 
sort of take for granted and it seems to

2323
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:21,970
translate not just what you do too,
but kind of any.

2324
01:52:21,971 --> 01:52:23,200
Anything that you teach people?

2325
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:23,900
Course.
Yeah.

2326
01:52:23,901 --> 01:52:28,901
If sometimes you do something naturally 
and it just feels right and then when 

2327
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:30,320
somebody asks,
oh,

2328
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,850
how'd you do that?
Or how'd you get out?

2329
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:36,710
Then you have to like sit and you have 
to program your mind to do and know what

2330
01:52:36,711 --> 01:52:39,680
you're doing instead of just reacting.
You know,

2331
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:41,260
you have to know like,
oh,

2332
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:43,490
this is.
I knew I did that and I know.

2333
01:52:43,790 --> 01:52:48,650
So I think it's a teaching for me has 
been huge and I really,

2334
01:52:48,651 --> 01:52:51,140
really enjoy teaching much more now.
You know,

2335
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:54,050
I really enjoyed teaching.
I really enjoy making people better.

2336
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:56,210
I really enjoy,
you know,

2337
01:52:56,211 --> 01:53:00,630
as a teacher I am able to see what a 
person needs and see where,

2338
01:53:00,631 --> 01:53:05,631
where,
where he's weak and try to make it 

2339
01:53:05,631 --> 01:53:07,130
better instead of coming in with a class
like in my mind,

2340
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:08,560
oh,
I'm going to just teach this class,

2341
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:10,010
I'm going to just teach this move.

2342
01:53:10,510 --> 01:53:15,510
Now I'm looking specifically to see what
this person is lacking in and how it's 

2343
01:53:15,510 --> 01:53:16,940
going to benefit.
Some guys are too hyper,

2344
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,500
you have to calm down,
breathe.

2345
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:20,780
Some guys are too slow.
Wake up buddy.

2346
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:21,890
Come on,
let's get it going.

2347
01:53:21,891 --> 01:53:24,220
You know?
And so I think the,

2348
01:53:24,510 --> 01:53:29,510
the,
the good teacher is the one who kind of 

2349
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:30,590
adapt to the needs of the student for 
the,

2350
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,590
for the goal of being better,
you know,

2351
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:35,900
I'm not necessarily trying to make you 
feel good.

2352
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:39,680
I'm not necessarily trying to make you 
believe something.

2353
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:43,070
I'm trying to make you better at g two,
you have to get better,

2354
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,860
you have to be a little bit better every
time you leave me,

2355
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:46,970
you know.
So,

2356
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:52,740
um,
I really believe that the more I teach 

2357
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:55,880
and especially for me personally because
my dad left when I was 18,

2358
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:57,920
so I had all these students at the 
academy,

2359
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:00,020
you know,
all these were all my training partners.

2360
01:54:00,020 --> 01:54:05,020
So I had to teach these people to be 
better so that I could have good 

2361
01:54:05,020 --> 01:54:07,200
training because if I didn't have,
if I was,

2362
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,060
they're like,
oh yeah,

2363
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:09,680
just do that move.
Yeah,

2364
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:10,940
keep going guys.
Keep going.

2365
01:54:10,941 --> 01:54:11,790
Open training.
All right.

2366
01:54:11,820 --> 01:54:15,470
But then I will not have great training 
partners the way I do now.

2367
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:17,600
I have great training partner now 
because I was like,

2368
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:22,660
okay,
how is this guy to beat me or don't let 

2369
01:54:22,660 --> 01:54:25,991
me get to this position and I'm very 
passionate on letting these guys get 

2370
01:54:25,991 --> 01:54:26,780
better to tell him.
I'll tell him,

2371
01:54:26,781 --> 01:54:27,260
man,
dude,

2372
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:32,580
the way you're going to pay me to do 
like this and I'm making these guys 

2373
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:34,190
better to try to beat me so that one 
they stay motivated and to.

2374
01:54:34,191 --> 01:54:39,191
So they gave me great training because I
can train now in my academy for four or 

2375
01:54:39,841 --> 01:54:44,841
five.
I don't need to go to train with these 

2376
01:54:44,841 --> 01:54:46,721
other because I have guys who know 
exactly what I do and I tell them 

2377
01:54:46,721 --> 01:54:49,751
exactly how to defend it and I'm working
that and the better I make them the 

2378
01:54:49,751 --> 01:54:51,080
better they're gonna make me.

2379
01:54:51,140 --> 01:54:56,140
So.
So you were teaching at Your Dad's 

2380
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:56,390
academy when you were 18?
You were basically 15,

2381
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,590
15.
I started teaching,

2382
01:54:57,591 --> 01:55:01,520
but I wasn't running the academy.
I wasn't teaching the classes at 16.

2383
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:05,210
I taught like once a week 17.
I started teaching a couple more times a

2384
01:55:05,211 --> 01:55:10,211
week.
By 18 I was fully teaching everything 

2385
01:55:10,211 --> 01:55:10,490
and running the whole academy.
Wow.

2386
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:12,740
So that's what you've been doing 
essentially for a living?

2387
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:14,300
Yeah.
Wow,

2388
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:20,440
that's crazy.
So for the past seven years that's been 

2389
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,120
what you do will.
Since I was 18,

2390
01:55:23,121 --> 01:55:24,660
I've been,
since I was 15,

2391
01:55:24,670 --> 01:55:26,810
I had been all the money I make is from 
Jujitsu.

2392
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:28,010
So yeah.
Wow,

2393
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:33,011
that's incredible.
So now when you teach 'em how many days 

2394
01:55:33,011 --> 01:55:34,310
a week you teaching?
I teach once a day.

2395
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,610
Once a day,
yeah.

2396
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,910
Do you have daytime classes?
It's someone else teaches.

2397
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:42,850
I teach once a day and then some days I 
teach twice and then some days I,

2398
01:55:42,851 --> 01:55:47,851
I the afternoon class and so I kind of 
scatter it out to where I can get to 

2399
01:55:48,310 --> 01:55:52,020
every teach two days in the afternoon 
and then I'll teach every night and then

2400
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,770
so some days on Tuesdays I teach twice a
day but.

2401
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:01,340
But yeah I teach a lot and I also teach 
enough to where I don't over teaching 

2402
01:56:01,981 --> 01:56:04,710
get kind of.
Because I've taught before where I teach

2403
01:56:04,711 --> 01:56:06,780
every class and that's training,
you know,

2404
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:08,550
you give a lot of your energy,
you teach it,

2405
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:10,350
you know,
you give,

2406
01:56:10,351 --> 01:56:15,351
give,
give and then you have nothing for 

2407
01:56:15,351 --> 01:56:17,061
yourself.
So I've found my kind of remedy of how 

2408
01:56:17,061 --> 01:56:19,851
much I can teach to where I still feel 
good about myself and still have enough 

2409
01:56:19,851 --> 01:56:22,020
to do the things I need to do.
So I teach,

2410
01:56:22,021 --> 01:56:27,021
you know,
Monday through Thursday nights and then 

2411
01:56:27,021 --> 01:56:27,480
I teach Tuesday and Friday mornings and 
then salaries,

2412
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:32,481
open training and so I kind of give 
myself a time to not have those 

2413
01:56:32,481 --> 01:56:32,481
responsibilities

2414
01:56:32,770 --> 01:56:34,510
now.
How do you structure a class?

2415
01:56:34,511 --> 01:56:39,511
Do you,
do you sit down and write out what your 

2416
01:56:39,511 --> 01:56:41,860
objectives are for each class?
Do you structure them in on the fly?

2417
01:56:41,861 --> 01:56:46,861
Like as you get there,
do you have specific things that you 

2418
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:49,471
want to work on?
Certain drills that you think that 

2419
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:49,471
people are lacking in?
Like

2420
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:52,860
everyday is different and it depends a 
lot on my mood to a.

2421
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:55,450
Some days I want to do a specific 
training for me,

2422
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:57,280
so I'll do like,
oh,

2423
01:56:57,340 --> 01:56:59,200
something that I feel like I need to 
work on,

2424
01:56:59,770 --> 01:57:04,770
so then I'll teach that move and I'll 
have something I know I'm not the 

2425
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:09,361
greatest asset,
so I'll teach that move and didn't try 

2426
01:57:09,361 --> 01:57:11,521
to really research and see how I can 
make it better and then work on that 

2427
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:11,530
move.
Sometimes I see what the class needs and

2428
01:57:11,531 --> 01:57:12,820
what,
what the,

2429
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:15,880
what.
I feel like those people who are in that

2430
01:57:15,881 --> 01:57:20,881
class,
how are they going to get the most out 

2431
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:20,881
of that class?
So some days it's,

2432
01:57:20,881 --> 01:57:22,160
it's like that.
Some days it's not.

2433
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:23,800
Some days I come up with stuff on the 
moment,

2434
01:57:23,820 --> 01:57:25,840
some days I'm kind of like thinking 
about something all day.

2435
01:57:25,870 --> 01:57:29,440
Everyday is different and uh,
are basically.

2436
01:57:29,441 --> 01:57:33,640
I never write anything down before I 
kind of just do everything on the spot.

2437
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:38,640
And basically my goal when I'm teaching 
is to make my students better and to 

2438
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,620
make them a gain.
You know?

2439
01:57:41,621 --> 01:57:43,810
So how I'm going to do that,
I don't know.

2440
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:46,210
I'm just going to kind of see and feel 
where,

2441
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,350
where it is,
you know,

2442
01:57:47,351 --> 01:57:52,351
sometimes I have a lot more beginners.
I'm not going to teach a fancy or 

2443
01:57:52,351 --> 01:57:54,460
something that took me 20 years to 
figure out.

2444
01:57:54,461 --> 01:57:55,960
I'm not gonna teach it to somebody 
beginners,

2445
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,210
so if there's a class in,
it's mostly beginners,

2446
01:57:58,211 --> 01:57:59,980
I'm going to teach him mostly beginner 
stuff.

2447
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:02,670
There's a class in,
it's these guys want to all train,

2448
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:05,410
then we will do all these trends.
So it depends.

2449
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:10,870
It's an interesting aspect about Jujitsu
that most people that have never 

2450
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:14,861
trained,
but it's very difficult for them to 

2451
01:58:14,861 --> 01:58:15,920
grasp the depth of technique.
There's so many different techniques and

2452
01:58:15,921 --> 01:58:18,950
there's so many different techniques 
that transitioned into other techniques.

2453
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,950
It's for the lay person to kind of 
understand it.

2454
01:58:21,990 --> 01:58:25,040
It's almost impossible.
So when you,

2455
01:58:25,490 --> 01:58:30,490
when you see someone like yourself that 
has a deep knowledge of it and then 

2456
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:34,481
teaches and trains and competes,
you got to kind of pay attention to it 

2457
01:58:34,481 --> 01:58:34,481
for many,
many,

2458
01:58:34,481 --> 01:58:37,040
many hours before you even see how deep 
the water is.

2459
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:41,380
Yeah.
I feel like the more you learn,

2460
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:43,390
the more you realize you don't know,
you know,

2461
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:45,610
and it can always be easier for,
you know,

2462
01:58:45,611 --> 01:58:48,250
like if you're training and you're 
having trouble,

2463
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,620
if it's difficult for you to beat your 
opponent,

2464
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:52,750
then it's,
you're doing something wrong,

2465
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,010
you know,
it should be easy.

2466
01:58:54,011 --> 01:58:59,011
You should be able to outsmart your 
opponent and it should be easy.

2467
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:04,051
Jujitsu is easy really.
So if you're having a struggle with any 

2468
01:59:04,051 --> 01:59:08,821
kind of training session or anything,
then that means you need to improve on 

2469
01:59:08,821 --> 01:59:11,461
something else to make your life easier.
So I really don't think that there is 

2470
01:59:11,461 --> 01:59:11,940
ever like a cap where you're going to be
like,

2471
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:13,190
oh,
I know everything and I,

2472
01:59:13,191 --> 01:59:18,191
I,
it gets to such a small detail and then 

2473
01:59:18,191 --> 01:59:21,151
it gets to like the timing of not only 
being able to know and to do what you 

2474
01:59:21,151 --> 01:59:21,670
do,
but do it at the right time.

2475
01:59:21,671 --> 01:59:24,460
So it's very complicated.
So complicated.

2476
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:26,320
I've cried so many times trying to 
figure it out.

2477
01:59:28,110 --> 01:59:32,050
Uh,
identity still to this day I feel like,

2478
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:37,560
fuck,
I'm only like maybe even halfway of 

2479
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:37,560
where I want to be.

2480
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:38,430
Dennis Mckenna,
who's a very brilliant guy,

2481
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:41,640
an interesting expression when it came 
to learning things,

2482
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:46,910
he said,
the brighter the bonfire of 

2483
01:59:46,910 --> 01:59:49,371
enlightenment,
the more surface area of ignorance is 

2484
01:59:49,371 --> 01:59:49,371
revealed.
So the more you know,

2485
01:59:49,371 --> 01:59:51,690
the more you realize God,
there's so much shit to.

2486
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:56,860
No,
it's true and it sort of applies to 

2487
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:00,291
everything,
but I think one of the unique things 

2488
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:00,420
about Jujitsu and one of the things that
I've gotten,

2489
02:00:00,421 --> 02:00:05,421
not just for myself but from other 
people that I've inspired to begin 

2490
02:00:05,421 --> 02:00:09,231
Jujitsu and start training Jujitsu,
is that they say that it makes 

2491
02:00:09,231 --> 02:00:11,000
everything else in their life better.
That they say that the,

2492
02:00:11,001 --> 02:00:16,001
the Jujitsu training,
the difficulty of it and the learning 

2493
02:00:16,001 --> 02:00:17,910
about themselves has helped them in 
virtually everything they do.

2494
02:00:18,500 --> 02:00:19,820
Yeah,
I definitely agree.

2495
02:00:19,821 --> 02:00:24,821
I wouldn't.
You couldn't give me a billion dollars 

2496
02:00:24,821 --> 02:00:24,821
today to take away the Jujitsu.
I know,

2497
02:00:24,821 --> 02:00:26,040
and you know,
that's it.

2498
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:28,220
There's no way,
you know,

2499
02:00:28,221 --> 02:00:31,400
like how I feel as a man,
how I talk and how I am.

2500
02:00:31,790 --> 02:00:36,790
He's 100 percent because of Jujitsu and 
that's just something that I'm very 

2501
02:00:36,891 --> 02:00:41,891
grateful to be to have landed where I 
landed in the footsteps of following my 

2502
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:47,680
father's footsteps and it's just a real 
Jujitsu will for sure.

2503
02:00:48,561 --> 02:00:52,730
Save your ass it one way or another.
Not necessarily a physical fight,

2504
02:00:52,731 --> 02:00:55,310
but also being able to deal with 
yourself,

2505
02:00:55,340 --> 02:01:00,340
know about yourself and and it really 
improve yourself as a whole because it's

2506
02:01:00,801 --> 02:01:05,801
very easy to get trapped into like a 
daily life schedule and you kind of 

2507
02:01:05,811 --> 02:01:10,811
don't even tap to your potential.
You don't even tap into discovering 

2508
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:11,060
yourself and realizing all these 
feelings.

2509
02:01:11,600 --> 02:01:16,600
I feel alive when I could compete and 
when I trained for a fight and when I 

2510
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,160
know I got to fight in this deadline and
if you on this day,

2511
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:24,550
you're going to show up whether you're 
going to be ready or not or whether 

2512
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:25,490
you're sick or hurt or this day this is 
going to happen.

2513
02:01:25,491 --> 02:01:30,491
So to know that that is going to happen 
and to be nervous and to train for that 

2514
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:34,961
and to put so much energy and wake up 
early and do a and drink this special 

2515
02:01:34,961 --> 02:01:36,680
juice and do this and,
and you know,

2516
02:01:36,770 --> 02:01:41,770
eat healthy and all this stuff that only
makes you know more sure of yourself.

2517
02:01:45,141 --> 02:01:46,530
And when the day happens,
you know,

2518
02:01:46,531 --> 02:01:48,950
like then after.
So it makes me feel alive.

2519
02:01:48,951 --> 02:01:53,951
I,
all these feelings that you get before 

2520
02:01:53,951 --> 02:01:53,951
you fight or when you're fighting or 
training for a fight.

2521
02:01:53,951 --> 02:01:56,180
It makes me feel alive and I love that 
feeling.

2522
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:59,750
Now if you take away competition from my
life,

2523
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:02,150
I will go crazy.
I'll go,

2524
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:03,530
I'll go crazy.
I would just wouldn't know.

2525
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:06,080
What days would you seem like?
Repetitive.

2526
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:08,570
I have no passion.
I lose my drive.

2527
02:02:09,290 --> 02:02:11,840
I kind of just start going down a dark 
hole.

2528
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:16,841
So I think that Jujitsu competitions 
really makes me feel alive and every 

2529
02:02:16,841 --> 02:02:19,790
time before I feel nervous and then 
after when I win or lose it,

2530
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:22,790
it's just a,
you only gain.

2531
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:24,530
And when you know that you're going to 
have a fight,

2532
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:30,070
you gained.
Because you know that you've got to be 

2533
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:30,070
at your best,
so you always like,

2534
02:02:30,070 --> 02:02:31,490
how am I going to get my better?
You're never good enough,

2535
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:35,090
and then it's just so.
It makes me feel real good.

2536
02:02:35,550 --> 02:02:38,400
Well,
one of the things that I feel is missing

2537
02:02:38,401 --> 02:02:43,401
in today's society is that people can 
get by really easily.

2538
02:02:44,070 --> 02:02:46,380
You know,
all you have to do is show up for work,

2539
02:02:46,381 --> 02:02:47,790
do your job,
go home,

2540
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:49,170
eat food,
go to sleep.

2541
02:02:49,470 --> 02:02:51,990
You don't have to struggle to acquire 
that food.

2542
02:02:51,991 --> 02:02:56,970
You don't have to really go through life
or death scenarios on a daily basis.

2543
02:02:56,971 --> 02:03:00,030
For most people,
a life or death scenario is incredibly,

2544
02:03:00,031 --> 02:03:05,031
incredibly rare,
but those scenarios are sort of 

2545
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:06,240
replicated inside the gym on a daily 
basis.

2546
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:11,720
When somebody,
some Jujitsu black belt is mounting you 

2547
02:03:11,720 --> 02:03:13,470
and he's choking the shit out of you.
Survival is the key thing.

2548
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,990
It's real.
It's real.

2549
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:17,040
Like,
you know,

2550
02:03:17,041 --> 02:03:17,490
look,
look,

2551
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:22,820
if,
if I'm rolling and you know John Jocks 

2552
02:03:22,820 --> 02:03:24,150
on top of me and he's got an arm 
triangle and I might black out,

2553
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,790
I'm 100 percent certain,
he's not going to kill me.

2554
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:28,200
He'll tap me,
you know,

2555
02:03:28,230 --> 02:03:30,090
I'll go.
Even if he chokes me up and go to sleep,

2556
02:03:30,091 --> 02:03:34,470
I know that I'm going to survive.
But you don't feel that at the time when

2557
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,390
you're,
when you are getting choked,

2558
02:03:36,391 --> 02:03:38,770
that is life or death.
It really,

2559
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:39,570
truly is.

2560
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:45,190
Can't fake those feelings that you feel 
when you're training and you put 

2561
02:03:45,190 --> 02:03:45,860
yourself through all these situations.
And I've been put to sleep many times in

2562
02:03:45,861 --> 02:03:46,550
training,
you know,

2563
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:49,940
and you know,
that's a crazy feeling.

2564
02:03:49,941 --> 02:03:51,320
You know,
it's a crazy feeling to like

2565
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:53,490
I don't want it to have been.
I don't want.

2566
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:56,000
I'm going to almost get out and I'm 
going to own more than.

2567
02:03:57,030 --> 02:03:59,380
And then you just wake up and you mother
fuckers are laughing at.

2568
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,220
So

2569
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:04,640
that's,
that's feeling

2570
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:09,640
that you cannot replace.
There is no other way that you're going 

2571
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:11,981
to be able to feel that unless you 
personally are like living in that 

2572
02:04:11,981 --> 02:04:16,811
moment and no matter what,
there's nothing more intense than 

2573
02:04:16,811 --> 02:04:16,850
somebody trying to choke you.
You know,

2574
02:04:16,870 --> 02:04:19,060
your natural,
so you,

2575
02:04:19,061 --> 02:04:22,580
you feel those feelings and,
and how you deal with those feelings are

2576
02:04:22,581 --> 02:04:27,581
going to really dedicate your life.
And that's how I kind of am able to read

2577
02:04:28,041 --> 02:04:29,540
people,
is how they deal.

2578
02:04:29,570 --> 02:04:31,370
How do they deal when they're under 
stress?

2579
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:35,210
How do they deal when they're winning?
How are they deal when their.

2580
02:04:35,600 --> 02:04:40,600
Everything's going good?
Are they the same person when they're 

2581
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:40,600
losing them,
when they're winning?

2582
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,670
How do they deal with when somebody out 
tomorrow?

2583
02:04:41,671 --> 02:04:46,671
So I've kind of always been really 
curious to see how people are and how 

2584
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:51,330
they,
how do they react,

2585
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:53,070
you know,
how are you going to react when somebody

2586
02:04:53,150 --> 02:04:54,770
beating you,
how you interact with somebody who's,

2587
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:56,250
when you're,
when you're winning,

2588
02:04:56,251 --> 02:04:58,680
when,
when you're stronger or how are going to

2589
02:04:58,681 --> 02:05:00,990
rack when somebody is weaker and you're 
just trying to help.

2590
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,700
So I think it's a kind of a great,
um,

2591
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:06,270
experience.
Jujitsu reveals character.

2592
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,330
Oh,
I have no more about my students,

2593
02:05:09,331 --> 02:05:11,760
didn't they know about themselves,
you know,

2594
02:05:11,840 --> 02:05:14,060
I will tell them exactly where they,
uh,

2595
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:19,340
you know,
I know everything about them because 

2596
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:19,340
I've trained with them and I know what 
they feel,

2597
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:20,820
how they feel,
when they're feeling great,

2598
02:05:20,821 --> 02:05:22,920
how they feel when they're feeling weak,
when they,

2599
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:24,930
when they,
when they're winning,

2600
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:27,390
you know,
I know how to feel if you're a coward or

2601
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:28,090
if you're,
if you're,

2602
02:05:28,240 --> 02:05:30,360
if you have hard,
if you've patients,

2603
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:33,630
if you have dignity,
all of these things are,

2604
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:36,180
are things that I can feel when I train 
with you.

2605
02:05:36,210 --> 02:05:38,320
Just give me five,
10 minutes to train with you and I don't

2606
02:05:38,330 --> 02:05:41,340
know more about you than probably you 
yourself,

2607
02:05:41,341 --> 02:05:43,710
unless you're very experienced person 
who is yourself.

2608
02:05:43,711 --> 02:05:45,600
So,
um,

2609
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:50,070
and that's what I kind of judged my 
whole basis on is how I feel,

2610
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:55,940
how I judge somebody on how they train.
I don't judge somebody by how they talk 

2611
02:05:55,940 --> 02:05:55,940
to me,
you know,

2612
02:05:55,940 --> 02:06:00,920
sometimes I'll get people who the super 
nice and they're super and super 

2613
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:03,720
respectful in person and they were just 
the perfect person.

2614
02:06:03,721 --> 02:06:04,870
Right?
And then when they train,

2615
02:06:04,871 --> 02:06:07,180
they just the,
there's this malaise from them.

2616
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:08,910
It's weird,
you know,

2617
02:06:08,911 --> 02:06:09,510
you're like,
Whoa,

2618
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:11,340
that malice is for real

2619
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:14,000
malice towards other people or

2620
02:06:14,150 --> 02:06:16,610
just not how they were when they were 
normal,

2621
02:06:17,210 --> 02:06:20,270
you know.
So when they're able to act,

2622
02:06:20,300 --> 02:06:22,220
they're able to put this show on for 
whoever,

2623
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:27,221
but when they're training,
there's no way you can hide your 

2624
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:27,221
personality.
So.

2625
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:27,221
And it goes the other way too.
It goes other people,

2626
02:06:27,221 --> 02:06:30,250
sometimes people are very cold and rude 
and,

2627
02:06:30,251 --> 02:06:30,630
and,
and,

2628
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:35,810
and that's not necessarily them,
they just don't feel necessarily when 

2629
02:06:35,810 --> 02:06:37,360
they train their,
they're respectful and they and they,

2630
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:39,620
you know,
they're trying to get better.

2631
02:06:39,621 --> 02:06:42,620
So there's a lot of different ways that 
you can kind of feel people out.

2632
02:06:42,621 --> 02:06:45,260
And I just kind of do my judgment on 
their training.

2633
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:47,780
I don't really care what people.
Of course I care,

2634
02:06:47,781 --> 02:06:51,350
but I don't judge too much on what you 
say and how you are.

2635
02:06:51,351 --> 02:06:54,530
Of course I feel it,
but when I train with you,

2636
02:06:54,531 --> 02:06:56,030
I'll make my final decision.

2637
02:06:57,820 --> 02:07:00,610
And on that note,
that's a beautiful way to describe it.

2638
02:07:00,850 --> 02:07:02,530
I love that.
I love that statement.

2639
02:07:02,531 --> 02:07:04,450
When I train with you,
I'll make my final decision.

2640
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:06,970
That's so true,
man.

2641
02:07:06,971 --> 02:07:11,971
That's so true.
You learn so much about someone when 

2642
02:07:11,971 --> 02:07:11,971
they train.
Now,

2643
02:07:11,971 --> 02:07:16,130
as far as your goals,
you've achieved world championship 

2644
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:18,490
status in Jujitsu.
What are your goals from now?

2645
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,140
Uh,
my goal now is to focus on MMA and,

2646
02:07:21,141 --> 02:07:25,510
and to be the best I can be in mma.
So that's my new mission.

2647
02:07:25,511 --> 02:07:27,510
And so you have aspirations to fight in 
the UFC?

2648
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:32,870
Yeah,
I mean right now I think the Japan is 

2649
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:33,340
the bed is the better opportunity for 
me,

2650
02:07:33,370 --> 02:07:34,690
but you know,
whatever,

2651
02:07:34,691 --> 02:07:39,691
if it's UFC or you know,
I'd love to fight in the UFC has the 

2652
02:07:39,691 --> 02:07:43,660
best fighters in the best organization.
So of course I would like to test myself

2653
02:07:43,661 --> 02:07:44,560
against those guys.

2654
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,950
So you want to try other organizations 
first,

2655
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:49,590
get your feet wet and mma and then 
eventually jump in.

2656
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:52,660
I don't know exactly,
but all I know is right now I have Japan

2657
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:56,740
to negotiate with and I know that of 
course wherever the best fighters are,

2658
02:07:56,741 --> 02:07:57,790
that's where all want to be.

2659
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,400
What do you,
what do you think about guys like,

2660
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:02,200
like [inaudible] grace here,
for example,

2661
02:08:02,230 --> 02:08:07,230
he's a perfect example of a guy's,
a very high level Jujitsu guy who just 

2662
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:09,910
hasn't really been able to get that much
going in mma.

2663
02:08:10,580 --> 02:08:12,740
Um,
I don't train with him so I don't really

2664
02:08:12,741 --> 02:08:13,550
know.
Uh,

2665
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:18,650
I know that he's a legend in Jujitsu and
he's been able to really excel energy 

2666
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:20,000
to,
um,

2667
02:08:20,030 --> 02:08:23,600
but I don't train with him.
I don't know necessarily how well he,

2668
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:26,420
what he does or anything.
So,

2669
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:29,960
uh,
I really hope that he's able to excel in

2670
02:08:29,961 --> 02:08:32,720
mma and I really hope that he's able to,
um,

2671
02:08:33,650 --> 02:08:36,200
show what he's about and bringing the 
game to his game.

2672
02:08:36,860 --> 02:08:40,400
And I saw a fight with him with the 
Kennedy,

2673
02:08:40,401 --> 02:08:45,401
I think it was and I just felt like he 
wasn't able to find his place and he 

2674
02:08:45,401 --> 02:08:45,680
wasn't able to find,
um,

2675
02:08:47,150 --> 02:08:52,150
find himself in the fight.
And I don't know if that's lack of 

2676
02:08:52,150 --> 02:08:53,240
training,
lack of advice,

2677
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:56,990
lack of knowing what to do.
I don't know what it is really.

2678
02:08:56,991 --> 02:08:59,730
And I'm curious to see if that's going 
to happen with me too,

2679
02:08:59,790 --> 02:09:04,790
because it gets also Tim Kennedy to Tim.
Kenny Kenny's really good verizon 

2680
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:04,790
animal.
Very good.

2681
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:04,930
But

2682
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,050
he's really a dangerous guy,
you know,

2683
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:09,790
a lot of stuff.
Way cuts and this,

2684
02:09:09,791 --> 02:09:13,240
that's how they start to.
So there's no real,

2685
02:09:13,241 --> 02:09:15,670
I don't know,
and I'm not the owner of the truth to be

2686
02:09:15,671 --> 02:09:18,370
able to tell you what he's doing or why 
he's not or what.

2687
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:21,130
I Dunno.
He's different than me.

2688
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:24,130
He's a different sides of me.
He's a huge guy.

2689
02:09:24,710 --> 02:09:27,150
Um,
I would love to see him just whoop ass,

2690
02:09:27,151 --> 02:09:28,750
you know,
I would love to see them do really well,

2691
02:09:29,350 --> 02:09:31,150
but his thought was a little different 
than mine.

2692
02:09:31,151 --> 02:09:31,900
You know,
he is bigger.

2693
02:09:31,901 --> 02:09:33,370
He,
I'm not.

2694
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:37,180
I have to 100 rely 100 percent rely on 
my technique and my leverage.

2695
02:09:37,190 --> 02:09:38,840
And,
and uh,

2696
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:40,360
we'll see what happens.
I'm really curious.

2697
02:09:40,361 --> 02:09:44,710
That's why I'm in this is to see and to 
prove to the people what I'm about.

2698
02:09:44,711 --> 02:09:49,711
So I hope harsher winds and I hope he 
does well and I'm hoping he's able to 

2699
02:09:49,711 --> 02:09:52,780
find himself and really be able to be 
where he's at,

2700
02:09:52,781 --> 02:09:54,120
which is the number one place,
you know,

2701
02:09:54,121 --> 02:09:55,390
that's where he deserves to be.

2702
02:09:55,550 --> 02:09:58,340
Were you there for any of horrors,
MMA fights?

2703
02:09:58,400 --> 02:09:59,960
No.
He,

2704
02:09:59,961 --> 02:10:02,870
um,
he had some disastrous,

2705
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:06,740
disastrous results in MMA.
Get some really high level guys were,

2706
02:10:06,741 --> 02:10:11,741
it seems like maybe he took some fights 
that maybe wasn't quite prepared for.

2707
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:18,120
Um,
do you learn from anything like that 

2708
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:18,860
when you see him fighting?
Guys like he fucked kid Yamamoto.

2709
02:10:18,861 --> 02:10:19,940
Right?
And kinky,

2710
02:10:19,941 --> 02:10:22,400
pseudo and real,
real high level guys.

2711
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:24,150
Yeah.
I don't know,

2712
02:10:24,151 --> 02:10:24,960
I,
I just,

2713
02:10:24,961 --> 02:10:25,330
uh,

2714
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:29,710
but he's another example of a very 
technical Jujitsu guy.

2715
02:10:29,711 --> 02:10:30,760
Very high level.

2716
02:10:31,050 --> 02:10:32,130
I'm curious,
you know,

2717
02:10:32,131 --> 02:10:37,131
I'm curious to see.
I'm going to be about in mma really for 

2718
02:10:37,131 --> 02:10:41,471
me to say sit here and tell you and be 
and act like I know what I'm doing and 

2719
02:10:41,471 --> 02:10:45,431
like I know the rules and I like,
I know that the truth behind everything 

2720
02:10:45,431 --> 02:10:50,021
is bullshit because I don't.
And I'm in it just like you're curious 

2721
02:10:50,021 --> 02:10:54,161
to see how I'm going to do.
I'm curious to see how I'm going to do 

2722
02:10:54,161 --> 02:10:54,490
too and I hope I do well and I hope I am
able to,

2723
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:54,980
to,
to,

2724
02:10:55,210 --> 02:10:58,160
to do everything that I want to do,
but I don't know.

2725
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:00,740
I don't know if that's going to happen 
and that's why we're going to.

2726
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:03,860
That's why I go there and test myself 
because if I knew I was going to win,

2727
02:11:03,920 --> 02:11:05,030
I probably wouldn't even fight.

2728
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:07,160
Well,
that's a beautiful aspect of what you're

2729
02:11:07,161 --> 02:11:12,161
trying to do.
The fact that you embracing a challenge 

2730
02:11:12,161 --> 02:11:14,711
that you are,
you are gravitating towards the most 

2731
02:11:14,711 --> 02:11:17,051
difficult thing you could possibly do.
And I can't to see what you're saying.

2732
02:11:17,631 --> 02:11:18,560
You know,
it's beautiful.

2733
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:19,970
The attitudes,
beautiful.

2734
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:20,490
Your,
your,

2735
02:11:20,500 --> 02:11:25,500
your thought process behind it,
the reason why you're doing it in the 

2736
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:25,500
first place.
It's all,

2737
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,660
all the right stuff and all that stuff.
Thank you.

2738
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:27,680
Well listen,
man,

2739
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:32,710
thank you very much for an awesome 
conversation and I look forward to 

2740
02:11:32,710 --> 02:11:34,610
seeing you compete in whatever you do,
whether it's Jujitsu or mma.

2741
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,160
I love your attitude.
I love all the things you've said.

2742
02:11:37,161 --> 02:11:42,161
I think you've opened up a lot of 
people's ideas and a lot of people's 

2743
02:11:42,161 --> 02:11:42,530
minds on how profound you're thinking 
is.

2744
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:43,690
And uh,
I think,

2745
02:11:43,691 --> 02:11:45,050
uh,
it's very inspirational.

2746
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,250
I appreciate it.
Enjoyed it very,

2747
02:11:46,251 --> 02:11:47,240
very much.
Thank you.

2748
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:49,980

in mma.
I would love to call one of your fights 

2756

There will be an honor for me to imagine

2757
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:18,980
a beautiful podcast is done.
