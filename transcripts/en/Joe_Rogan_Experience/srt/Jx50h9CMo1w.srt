1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,920
Male.
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,900
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is a guy
is in need of a new way of saying that

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,040
because it's fucking tired of it.
Goddammit Patrick Turner,

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,140
the coming distractions. Yeah. Here,

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,440
here's some shit you should do with
your money if you want to help the show.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,450
It doesn't really help us.
I mean it sort of helps us.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,270
It helps the people who pay us.
So it helps us indirectly.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,790
One thing we can promise you, when we, uh,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,770
have any sort of sponsorship on the show,

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,420
it is 100% of product that I believe
in. There's, there's no like,

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,680
we'll never bullshit you. So anything
that we have that sponsors a show,

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,480
you can guarantee that what we are
saying first of all is 100% of what we

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:46,260
believe. And the, if we find out that
it's incorrect in any way, shape or form,

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,400
we will go back and correct it. There's
a, the last thing I want, that's a little,

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,360
that's not subtle enough.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,050
The last thing I want is for anyone to
get ripped off ever from anything that

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,340
I'm associated with.
So everything we sell you,

18
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:03,360
whether it's the supplements from
on it or Ting, uh, we believe in,

19
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,390
what is Ting Ting is if you go to
rogan.ting.com you will be able to get a

20
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:14,310
better understanding of it. And you also
save 50 bucks on your first ting device.

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,870
They have a bunch of cool smartphones,
including the Samsung Galaxy s three.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,760
I only saw amazing your day.
Don't do it. Don't know. Tim,

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,640
why don't you hook Brian
Redman up of the phone?

24
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:28,380
I think we need his technical advice
because I just love me like the bigger

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,320
pictures.
Maybe like going on browser,

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,450
big screen.

27
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,490
I've been using this nexus seven thing
here and it has the android operating

28
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:42,330
system on it. And so now I'm like, man,
I wish I could use this as a phone. Yeah.

29
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:45,030
Because I kind of want to see the
Internet. Is it on the Internet?

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,660
It's a Wifi only. So I use my
iPhone five to teeth are at to,

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,680
do they make any ones like that that
are um, by the way, it's tethered.

32
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,240
You're fuck,
there is

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,750
um, the, um, did they
make them that small?

34
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:04,020
That actually or is it the note is
the only one that's smaller than that.

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,770
It is a smaller, they don't make something
that size. That's a phone though. No,

36
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:10,890
I don't think so.
But I think us cellular Wifi,

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,520
I saw somebody use one of those
notes on the other day. This girl,

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,360
this little girl had this humongous phone.
It was like,

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,020
it looked like the old days when people
had boombox is on your shoulders.

40
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,970
But they're cool man. I'm telling you,
I get mad phone envy, technology envy.

41
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,780
Whenever I see that screen. Um, they
don't, sorry, Tim doesn't have that.

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,120
But they have the galaxy s three.
That's why I want to get it yesterday.

43
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:35,340
And I walk into a huge too.
That's like a medium,

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,150
a medium ground between the note and the,
some of the other Google smart phones.

45
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,470
Um,
but the,

46
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,020
what's great about Ting is the way
they've set up their business and the,

47
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:49,021
the idea behind it is you can still run
a good business and make money and not

48
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,150
have to rip people off.

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,010
Not have to get people involved in these
crazy contracts where you can't get out

50
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,680
of it unless you pay money. I think
that's disgusting. I really do.

51
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,750
I think it's a crazy,

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,250
horrible situation where when you,
when you order service,

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,940
especially from some gigantic
multibillion dollar companies, you know,

54
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,240
when you're ordering service,
when you don't want the service anymore,

55
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,450
you should be able to say, I don't want
your service anymore. Thank you very much.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,380
And boom, it goes away. It shouldn't
be you have to pay them money.

57
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,660
But that's how it is with
most major providers.

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,990
And Ting doesn't have it set
up like that thing. Also, I,

59
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:30,640
I misspoke when I said that, um, you, um,

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,320
that you're,
you're,

61
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,160
you're minutes go into the next
month if you don't use them,

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,300
it's actually better than that.

63
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,480
They actually knocked you down on your
bill and then they credit you the next

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,690
month. So it's like they
actually charge you less money.

65
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,430
This is not even that they
give you more minutes,

66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,300
you less so they take away
like you have a credit. Say,

67
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,630
if you have a plan and you,
your,

68
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:57,700
your plan is to use x amount of minutes
for x amount of dollars per month.

69
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
If you use less than that, they
will actually bill you less. I see.

70
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,140
They'll credit your next month.
Right? It's, I mean overpaid on us.

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,130
It's a great company and they use sprint.

72
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:11,131
So it's a major networks network backbone
without the contracts and all the

73
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:17,080
other craziness that goes along with,
uh, using cells for cell phone service.

74
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,290
It's really nuts. So we support
Tang. They're a cool company.

75
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:25,291
And if you go to rogan.ting.com you
can save 50 bucks of one of their many

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,040
Badass android devices. It's
really, if you're into technology,

77
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,810
it's fucking fascinating stuff.

78
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,680
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com that's, Oh,

79
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,990
Anne and I tea makers of Alpha brain.
What are you doing Bryan?

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,210
You scan the shit out of me.

81
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,290
I got to put too much Alpha brain
and my system for your sound effects.

82
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,020
What is Alpha brain? It's um,
it's most certainly is no miracle.

83
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,810
Okay. It's not if you're a
really dumb person. I'm so sorry.

84
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,310
But there's nothing you can do.
But what it can do for you is what really,

85
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:02,260
essentially all nutrients can
improve the way your body functions.

86
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,060
It's what your body needs to run.

87
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,270
And we live in a world where most of
us don't eat enough of the proper food.

88
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:12,940
We don't eat enough healthy
green leafy vegetables.

89
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:16,480
That's like one of the main ones. Um,
all sorts of different vegetables.

90
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:18,420
We don't drink enough
water. We, you know, we,

91
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,830
we took a lot of stupid
shit into our bodies.

92
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,960
So the fix that first before you start
taking any supplements before you just,

93
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,350
you know,

94
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,590
eat fucking two cheeseburgers and then
go take some shroom tech and want to work

95
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:32,890
out. It's not like that you should
take care of your body first.

96
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,560
That's number one.
Eat as much healthy food as possible.

97
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:39,160
Give yourself some cheat days, man. Give
yourself some days where you fuck off.

98
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,180
But for the most part, try to eat
healthy. You will feel better for sure.

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,700
And more importantly,
your mind will function better.

100
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:49,030
There's essential nutrients that your
mind needs to function at its optimal

101
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,750
level.

102
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,560
And what we've done with Alpha brain is
isolate those nutrients and give them to

103
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:58,160
you in the purest, most effective form
possible there is behind it. However,

104
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,940
I am way too stupid to be describing
that science because I really have no

105
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,440
education in any of these subjects and
it's really nonsense and Jibberish that

106
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,200
I've just memorize for people
far more intelligent than myself.

107
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,290
If you go to [inaudible] dot com
it'll all be explained to you.

108
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,950
There is Alpha brain, which is the
one that, uh, I, I talk about so much.

109
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,000
It's the one that I take before every
comedy show. I take it before podcasts.

110
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,230
It's, um, it's,

111
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,340
it's most certainly has a positive
effect on the mental function.

112
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,910
And I have so many of my friends addicted
to it. It's a some fascinating shit.

113
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,910
But if it doesn't work for you,
you get 100% of your money back.

114
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Our first order of 30 pills and you
don't even have to return the product.

115
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,520
Just say this didn't work for me,
and then you get your money back.

116
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,130
Nobody wants you to be ripped off.
And if you use a code name Brogan,

117
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:45,131
you will save 10% off any and all orders
of all supplements that are available

118
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,310
through on it, including hemp force
protein, the hemp based protein,

119
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,240
which is legal and won't, you won't test
positive for marijuana. Don't sweat it.

120
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,530
It's not what it is. It's really, it's
a weird little loophole where it's like,

121
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,310
it's very similar to the marijuana plant,
but it does,

122
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:05,240
it's not psychoactive so you can eat
it and it's really healthy for you. Um,

123
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,050
hemp protein is really healthy. It's
what they use for fiber, for clothes,

124
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:12,230
like camp clothes.
But it's illegal to grow in America,

125
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,550
but you can buy it. But you got
to buy it with cash from Canada.

126
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:21,180
It's fucking squirrely set up
folks. So we get hemp prone, uh,

127
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,770
protein, the finest hemp hearts from
Canada. It's really hard to do it.

128
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:29,660
It's annoying because it takes jobs away
from US farmers, if I'm on it, could,

129
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,440
we would love to have a farm here in
America and grow hemp and hire people and

130
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:36,680
employ them. But we can't. We can't
because we have a corrupt government.

131
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,010
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's just,

132
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,990
it's just been around for so
long in this stupid wonky,

133
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:44,900
transparent bullshit form that we,
for whatever reason,

134
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,570
are stuck there and unless
less people talk about it,

135
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:49,880
it's going to stay that way.
And this is the problem folks.

136
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,090
It's nonsense that Hamsa legal,
it's nonsense.

137
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,960
It's not even related to the marijuana
as a psychoactive drug debate,

138
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,950
which is also nonsense grown people
telling you what the fuck to do.

139
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,910
But because of that nonsense, you can't
buy hemp very cheap. It's expensive stuff.

140
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:08,270
Use a code name broken,
save 10% we also have kettle bells.

141
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,980
We have a battle ropes, all different
things to get you fit in a functional way.

142
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,910
Uh, and by the way, all this
stuff is stuff that I use myself.

143
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,840
All of it is stuff that I've learned from
strength and conditioning coaches from

144
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,140
a guys that train people
for Jujitsu or MMA.

145
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,350
It's all like the best exercises to
a really sort of for functional form,

146
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,160
for functional strength, for strength,
where your whole body moves as one unit.

147
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,580
You know, these kettlebell
exercises, it's a, you're not this,

148
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,440
you're not isolating any
muscle groups really.

149
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,350
It's like you're using your entire
body and when you do that, it's like,

150
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,330
first of all, you feel great. It's great
to have like a body that works well.

151
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,450
It's great to be able to
move things. It's, I mean,

152
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,750
just forget the superficial way that
you would look. Just, it's great.

153
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,050
It's nice to have a
functional body that looking,

154
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,680
pick things up if you need the moved.
You know what I mean?

155
00:08:58,681 --> 00:09:00,540
People don't think about it that way.
Where you essentially,

156
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,110
your body is like a race car. You could
choose how much horsepower to put in it.

157
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,750
Oh, I have to do is lift weights. If you
lift weights, you get more horsepower.

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,550
It's that simple. Brian,
Dj Brian on the mix.

159
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,230
Anyway. Um, we also have
BLENDTEC blenders coming in.

160
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,350
They should either be in today or
tomorrow. I think they're in already.

161
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,130
They're fucking fantastic. There's the
blenders that we saw we use on an iPhone.

162
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,960
We just decided to start selling them
like they're the best blenders. Yes,

163
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,060
they're awesome. They they, yeah. Though
I use a Vitamix, which is equally good.

164
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,280
Excellent, excellent blender.
But, uh, most of the consensus
was that blend texts.

165
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,720
I wonder if you could
blend a Vitamix with this,

166
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,180
break it up first, but I bet you could
just try one that pointed the blades,

167
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:47,860
couldn't blend the blades. Right. I
don't know what the fuck would happen.

168
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,300
Should it be chaos,

169
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,080
uh, on a.com folks and
also, uh, Jesus Christ, uh,

170
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,010
audible was the last one. I
love audible. audible.com if a,

171
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,560
let me pull up the euro URL real quick.

172
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,920
Lot of people are saying thank you for
introducing them to the Steve Martin Book,

173
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,570
uh, born standing up. Uh,
uh, they loved it. Yeah.

174
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:15,180
Because Steve Martin reads it and so it's
like listening to like a play on that.

175
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,660
It's great. I highly recommend it.
I like audible for like road trips.

176
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,690
I'll put it on my iPhone and just like
Bluetooth it over and listened to us.

177
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,000
People talk and fall asleep
while I'm driving. Yeah.

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,360
I'm a huge fan of books on tape.
Uh, when I used to use them,

179
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:36,750
a lot of road gigs, whenever to have
these long road gigs, it'd be painful.

180
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:39,410
I going to drive like three hours
up to Maine or something like that.

181
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,460
Back then they were all cassettes, but
I, I got into it and it's like, man,

182
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,010
it changes a boring drive
and does something wrong.

183
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,050
Really exciting. Okay. All right. That
was a mistake. These are ridiculous.

184
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,830
You look a little try. This is the
way it was supposed to sound like,

185
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,430
that's like a little car that's better.
That's way better.

186
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,690
Um,
they're all w,

187
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,190
but it was trying to say is that when
you're on a long boring ass drive or any

188
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,930
kind of commute, plane flight, whatever,

189
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,880
it can literally turn something that's
seemingly meaningless into an educational

190
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,800
experience and inspirational experience.
I mean,

191
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,610
that's the beauty of books on tape or
could just be like really educational,

192
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,580
you know? Um, I mean,
it's, uh, to me it's a,

193
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:28,410
it's an awesome resource that a
lot of people don't take. Pardon.

194
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,220
And,
uh,

195
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,630
it allows you to make productive
time and enjoyable time out of time.

196
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:37,890
That sucks. That fucking dumb ass commute
you have to do every day. You know,

197
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:42,720
when you, when you listen to an
excellent book on tape, man, it's a,

198
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,890
it really is. Um, to me it's,
it's a total game changer.

199
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,160
It makes it enjoyable. You actually get
home, you're like, how you feel? Great.

200
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:54,460
It just so fired up. You know, I've
sometimes gone home and, uh, you know,

201
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:59,020
taking the CD out and listen to a
book on tape in my house, you know,

202
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,960
and you could do that if you have an
iPhone hook up to your car too. I just,

203
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,020
I'll just continue it.
I get got rope 10. Um,

204
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,640
if you go to Joe Rogan,
Duh,

205
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,550
it's the wrong fucking URL.

206
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,440
audible.com backslash, uh, something

207
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,310
that didn't help at all.

208
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,380
Bull backs.
I think it's Joe Rogan.

209
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,260
Let's see. It's that, or it's, Joe
was trying to leave it hit a bump.

210
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,300
They say so it's not that.
Yeah.

211
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,630
I'm trying to look up Alison Shudi.
Yeah. Okay. It's Joe. That's what it is.

212
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,730
It's audible.com. Forward slash. Joe,
if you do it, you, uh, if you go there,

213
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:45,731
you can try audible free for 30
days and get a free audio book.

214
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,990
So it's an awesome resource.

215
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:51,650
Audible is one of the best sites
in the world when it comes to this.

216
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:52,181
It's like the,

217
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:55,580
the most prominent site in the world when
it comes and they've been around for a

218
00:12:55,581 --> 00:12:56,080
long time

219
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,720
and the onset of Opiod,
Anthony shows when you were on there,

220
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:02,560
they have like back episodes of when
you ran or an opiate Anthony. So like,

221
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,910
like you can listen to it. Ari should
fear and us and everyone on, on,

222
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,720
on the opn yet they'd, they also have
a your cd's on here and shit like that.

223
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,810
So it's a good way to buy your stuff.
Yeah, it's just, it's a cool service.

224
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,790
It's a cool service that we
would like to set up. Uh,

225
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,420
I really enjoy the audio books and,
and you know,

226
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:21,230
of course shows like opie and Anthony,

227
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,190
great to be able to get to and
comedy cds and stuff like that.

228
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,180
It's just a huge variety
of things. But the, the

229
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,090
beautiful thing is if you go
to audible.com four slash Joe,

230
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:32,190
you could try it out free for 30 days

and get a free audio book,
right? Is that what it is? Yeah.

232
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,400
Something along those lines. Uh,
yes. That is exactly what it is.

233
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,090
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
let's fucking get this show rolling.

234
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,610
This is the lamest
commercials we've ever done.

235
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,000
We need a little fire under our asses,

236
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,080
ladies and gentlemen.
The Great Alex Gray is here.

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,380
We're going to get the bottom of
some shit and figure some things out.

238
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,650
Good

239
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,100
experience,
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

240
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,990
If there is a man that is on more

241
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:14,220
dorm room walls than you,

242
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,680
it might be frank Frazetta but it's
only like if you count all time,

243
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,581
you know,

244
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:25,460
if you think about it like if as far as
like the 70s and eighties those poster

245
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,160
years, Frank Frazetta put in
some God damn numbers. You know,

246
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,290
that guy that he had some amazing stuff,

247
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:36,291
but you sir are right up there and
you are as far as like the psychedelic

248
00:14:37,171 --> 00:14:38,070
community goes,

249
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,940
you're the only guy that I've ever
seen that I've looked at your work.

250
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:46,800
And I'm like, wow, that guy actually
like captured some of that. You, you,

251
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:50,040
you've actually grabbed some
of it and you've, uh, it's,

252
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,120
it's v for someone who has

253
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,580
an experienced,
uh,

254
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,460
a really intense psychedelic
breakthrough sort of a moment. They,

255
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,420
they, I don't know if they would
connect with your art work the same way.

256
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:06,500
It's beautiful. It's striking.
It's amazing and unique. But it's,

257
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,700
what's amazing to me about it
is that when I see your stuff,

258
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,140
it's like you've really captured
something somehow or another,

259
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,050
the, the, the unremembered bubble.

260
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,460
You remembered it enough or you
channeled it enough or whatever,

261
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,370
but you nail stuff,
man. Mean you're, that,

262
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:28,330
that one that you were just showing
the Hologram. Oh yeah. What is,

263
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,320
what is the cause one of my faves?
Yeah, it's one of my favorites.

264
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,780
The, uh, the, the Bardo
being, and then the, uh,

265
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,180
diamond being at, let's
say they angles here. Yeah.

266
00:15:42,181 --> 00:15:45,150
There's a diamond being,
there's a bar that

267
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,990
there's the,
uh,

268
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,770
jewel being so see how they kind of like,
uh,

269
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,653
they,
uh,

270
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,640
it's like you have a little trans
dimensional portal and in a postcard.

271
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,710
Wow. That's amazing. That's beautiful.
That one right there, that one that,

272
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,470
that's yeah, that's totally damped. Yeah.

273
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:12,270
You nailed body who has had the
trip to me and experience, uh,

274
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,260
recognizes it.

275
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:17,730
And that's what's really fascinating
because it's impossible to actually

276
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:22,530
translate that trans dimensional
realm that enter dimensional,

277
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,110
uh, uh, infinitude.

278
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,470
And yet as crude as it is a
painting that's an authentic,

279
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,150
uh, transmission from that stain
will communicate to people.

280
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,390
And it astonishes me that,
uh,

281
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,390
I meet brothers and sisters all over
the world that say the same thing,

282
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:47,070
that they've been there, they've seen
that, they know where I'm painting from.

283
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,530
Have you ever had a thought in your
mind or a dream where somehow no,

284
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:53,211
other than the dream,

285
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:57,660
this has happened to me several times in
my life where an image, a really weird,

286
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:58,321
bizarre,

287
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:03,321
random image was recognized to me to
mean something or have some significant,

288
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:09,060
uh, play some significant part of
my life, whether it's some friends,

289
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,830
I know a place that I live, but it
would be imagery. It was really weird.

290
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,530
It like I looked at that imagery,
whatever it was,

291
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:21,450
it's strange geometric pattern and it
represented to me very clearly like this

292
00:17:21,451 --> 00:17:25,420
aspect of my life, but only in a dream
form. It's visual poetry and I re,

293
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,270
I remember so many times it's going,

294
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,420
I got to wake up and I
got to write this down,

295
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:35,421
but I couldn't even write it down because
the shape was constantly moving in my

296
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:38,010
mind. Yeah. You know, it
had like, I was like, no,

297
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:41,940
but if I could just draw this image
with bill, that's what you did,

298
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,440
exactly what you drew that. Yeah. It's
kind of a compression of, of that.

299
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,160
That's for you. Of course. Thank you.
Yeah, you nailed man. Whatever it is

300
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,450
right there. Boom. The one
with the stripes, Holy Shit.
The skulls and the stripes.

301
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,400
That's insane, man. That's like,

302
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,990
that's as close to what a
real trip feels like as,

303
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,824
as possible.

304
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,480
And that's for anybody who has ever
had any sort of psychedelic experience.

305
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,290
That's the crazy thing about it at all.
After all rather is that it is possible.

306
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,480
It's hard to believe that it's possible.
Wouldn't you know,

307
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,400
I wanted to, um, give to you, uh,

308
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,340
the fourth book in America. Uh, you're,

309
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,960
you will be the fourth now.
This is,

310
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,010
you'll be the fourth person
to have seen, uh, this book,

311
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,860
which we just got an hour ago.

312
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,940
My wife and daughter and I saw it.

313
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,970
It was delivered to her door and we,
and we drove right over here. Wow.

314
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,310
So this is t you a brand new,

315
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:48,810
it won't be out in the United States for
another month and a half or something

316
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:52,500
like that. Wow. It is a net of being.

317
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,480
Wow. This is awesome. Thank
you very much. That's cool.

318
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,643
Wow.

319
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,010
This is incredible. I can't wait to go
through it. I'm going to set it down,

320
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,000
but I've been a fan of
your work for years, man.

321
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,130
I've got a big a piece of yours.
Um,

322
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,750
hanging up in my isolation tank room,
I have several of them.

323
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:16,690
I have a disco ball and
that isolation tank, no,

324
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:21,400
I think that's what it needs and really
take it over the edge. Um, the, um, uh,

325
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,950
the cosmic Christ,
it's another one of my favorites.

326
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,400
It's when did you start
doing this kind of art? I,

327
00:19:28,401 --> 00:19:29,530
how long have you been doing this?

328
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,833
Oh,
let's see.

329
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,780
When I was at 21,

330
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,660
I had a kind of a crisis I think.

331
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,930
And I wasn't sure that I really wanted
to live any longer because I was really,

332
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:51,000
uh, um, I was really depressed.

333
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,860
And so,

334
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,000
and of course I did not believe
there was a spiritual reality at all.

335
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,020
And even though my,
my friends had a,

336
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,270
had a trip before me,
I never did because I was so miserable.

337
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,330
I just thought I'd go to hell
and who needs infinite hell?

338
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,620
And so anyway, at some point, uh,

339
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,150
I prayed to a god that I
didn't really believe existed.

340
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,980
And, uh, uh, that if you do exist, then I,

341
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,850
uh, I need a sign or, you
know, I'm through and,

342
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,510
and so within 24 hours,
I,

343
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm saying goodbye to my
professor, uh, at art school.

344
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,100
And it was the last day of school,

345
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,980
like August 30th or something or, or, uh,

346
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,560
didn't, no, no, no. It was
like May 30th, May 30th. And,

347
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,850
and around the corner drives us a VW at,
and it's Sa,

348
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,780
the Scow, Alison who, uh, uh,

349
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,110
invites us to her graduate now it's kind
of like the end of school party and her

350
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:06,280
sister's in town. And so, uh,

351
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,300
so this professor picks me up later
that night and we go to this party.

352
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,100
And on the way he says,
I've got in this bottle,

353
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,380
some Kahlua and LSD.
And I said,

354
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
you know what? Basically, what the fuck?

355
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,160
And so I drank about half of it and,

356
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,610
uh, I got to the door and the
gout drinks the other half.

357
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
And I sit on her couch for the entire

358
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,380
journey almost. And, uh,

359
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:46,530
just sit there kind of weirdly inside
myself on one of her sculptures,

360
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,490
a couch with a,

361
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,800
with a soft figurine of a self portrait.
And so,

362
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,760
um,
when I closed my eyes inside,

363
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,120
and I've never had a trip like this sense,

364
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,530
but I was in the dark,
I could see I was in the dark,

365
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:10,860
but I was going toward the light because
there was this curling kind of mother

366
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:13,630
of Pearl,
like conch shell thing.

367
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,340
And I was like a tunnel with a light
coming just from around the side.

368
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,860
And, uh, and it was awesome because
it was, that was it. Of course,

369
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,310
this was God.
This was the light was God.

370
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,780
And I knew that even if I was in the dark,
I was going toward the light.

371
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,190
And I saw that all the
shades of gray connect,

372
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,840
both those opposites. And so I
changed my name to gray right then.

373
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,170
And so my art has always been kind of
trying to integrate the spectrum of

374
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:53,521
reality into a more holistic picture of,

375
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,230
uh,
the trans dimensional,

376
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,650
the visionary and the Trans transcendental
because the transcendental aren't

377
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:07,660
traditions, you know, the, all the
sacred arts of all the different world,

378
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,540
visionary cultures.
Cause all,

379
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,510
all religion comes from
the mystical experience.

380
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,430
And that's a visionary experience.
And you see it through all the, uh,

381
00:23:17,431 --> 00:23:19,900
the mosques are beautifully worn,

382
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:24,901
a mentally patterned from the same
visionary mindscape that a Dmt user would

383
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:26,344
recognize.

384
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,690
And the same thing goes for the great
Christian masterpieces and all through a

385
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,480
world religion,

386
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:39,870
there are these waves that
have crystallized into these
visionary experiences of

387
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:44,800
angels, of demons, of all kinds
of worlds. And they're really,

388
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,770
uh, uh, it's,

389
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:52,730
it's the thing that connects all the
world religions is sacred art, you know?

390
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,460
And so we started thinking like,
wow,

391
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,010
there's needs to be a new kind of sacred
art that integrates this visionary

392
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:05,620
dimension of where all, all cultures, uh,

393
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,010
emanate from this vision at
the true visionary cultures.

394
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,380
Aminay from us. You, she see it in the
Shapebos, you see it in, uh, the, uh,

395
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,260
the we chose way.
You see it in so many of face,

396
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,530
uh,
patterns.

397
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,420
Isn't it a fascinating thing that art
is such an integral part of religion,

398
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:29,420
but it's not really discussed that way.

399
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,730
Religion is all about
ideology for most people.

400
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,080
But if you really stop and think
about it, the, the Christian artwork,

401
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,040
the Hindu artwork,
why do we care about,

402
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,100
we listened to the music or
watch the dance. You know, it's,

403
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,280
it's the way that people connect together.
It's a fascinating aspect though,

404
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:50,750
a really underappreciated aspect. The
aspect of religious art having influence.

405
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:54,260
Cause especially when you're stopping and
you're thinking about back when people

406
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:58,820
had no other transmissions, there was
no broadcast images. There's no video,

407
00:24:58,821 --> 00:24:59,990
there was no photographs.

408
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,850
You literally had nothing or
incredibly stunning religious heart.

409
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,370
You know, that's it. You know,

410
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:11,990
there was nowhere else to go to see
iconography and was probably the most

411
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:14,750
impactful thing a person
could see back then.

412
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:17,660
Cause there'd be all this other
art. But the other art, you know,

413
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,360
whether it's a painting of a tree
or whatever the fuck it is, it's,

414
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:22,790
it's not going to be Jesus,
you know,

415
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:26,240
and someone who can paint an
incredibly detailed Jesus.

416
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,070
And if you stop and think about the time
in which these people were doing this,

417
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,210
you know, this is a, an
incredibly, like the,

418
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,090
like the access to
information was almost nil.

419
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,830
So this to them must have been
hugely impactful. The actual,

420
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,470
because you could see it and
it wasn't just a thought,

421
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:49,160
it wasn't just you talking about,
you can actually see this painting.

422
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,020
There are benchmarks in the evolution of
human consciousness as what they are so

423
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:59,021
strange that it's not really talked about
as being completely connected because

424
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,690
it's the underground mycelium of
visionary culture that unite everyone.

425
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,330
And that's what the religion
of the 21st century is,

426
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:14,330
I think is just your creativity,
you know,

427
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:18,830
and it's your way that you connect
with God however it is. And it's, uh,

428
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,350
it comes out.
You can look at the art,

429
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,370
you can see how the arts could
unite all world religions.

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,070
It's trans dimensional,
you know,

431
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,590
or Trans Trans Denominational
and tries to match now,

432
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,710
you know,
and that's what we're building at Kozum.

433
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,810
Even,
uh,

434
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:43,810
Scientology has lava exploding out
of a mountain and across with like

435
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,910
a crazy star thing in the
middle of it. Yeah. You know,

436
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,940
they have their own shit to deal Mormons.
The Mormons have religious artwork.

437
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,630
Oh Wow. They have temples and they're
quite extraordinary. So thank you.

438
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,160
And the, and the stories
themselves are works of art. No,

439
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,360
they are all religious.
Yes.

440
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,250
All the stories of all the founders
and mystics come from this visionary

441
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,800
experience. They have. I
think Joseph Smith though,

442
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,770
it's been pretty much proven
that it was a con man. Well,

443
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,410
he claimed to have a mystical experience.

444
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,660
That's what ignited the excitement,
the religious fervor of people.

445
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,310
He was also monitored, you know, and
there are a lot of people who hated him.

446
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,560
Obviously. He wished martyred
at like the Bob Gotten martyred,

447
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:34,850
the behind the Great Behi. Now there's,
I'm not familiar with that story.

448
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,350
Oh my God.
You know,

449
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:42,690
it's not the church of the sub genius
Bob. It's the, uh, it's the, uh,

450
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,330
founder of the Behi religion.
And where's that from? Uh,

451
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,110
unfortunately I ran
and I believe, and, uh,

452
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,940
they, so he was, uh, considered
a heretic and it was the,

453
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,090
I believe later 19th century
when he received the,

454
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,170
uh, understanding that there is a unity
of all world religions that we should

455
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,850
consort with people of all
religions. And that, uh,

456
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
that religion comes in waves of revelation
and he argued for the equality of,

457
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,940
uh, uh, women and men and the, uh,

458
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,440
the friendship of all
races. And so this, uh,

459
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,870
the understanding of how, uh, some
of the religions had failed us,

460
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,850
but not pointing out negatives,
but just positing, uh,

461
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,230
what could be as a higher
vision of a world religion.

462
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,760
It's fascinating to me that even
religions that are clearly made up,

463
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,460
like we're someone that sat out
to try to create a religion,

464
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:48,890
you can call it a cult or what have you,

465
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,260
but there's ones that they've done that
where even though you know that someone

466
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,770
invented it, it's still has a
positive impact on those people. Yeah.

467
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,800
So it's almost like even creating a
fake religion if done the right way,

468
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,890
imparts an important,
there's a problem of,

469
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,060
I think there's a problem with that is
really, yeah. Yeah. Well I definitely,

470
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,780
yeah, stuff based on false hoods
are not really religion. To me.

471
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,940
The, the, uh, the, the real
religion, uh, has to do with contact,

472
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:26,340
direct contact with God and that's,

473
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,830
that's then it comes out
through these stories and, uh,

474
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,160
the validity of any of the world
religions is through the direct contact.

475
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:39,570
But I know people that are Mormons that
have benefited tremendously from being

476
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,830
Mormon. I mean, I know some really

477
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,090
nice, friendly people and a lot of
that is attributed to their faith,

478
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,200
which brings them to these churches and
these communities. But that, you know,

479
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,820
that thing was created by a 14 year old
boy who said he found golden tablets

480
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:56,290
that were the last work of Jesus.

481
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,480
That is something that
was created by [inaudible]

482
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,820
bullshit. While it seems to be helping
those people, it might've been a dream.

483
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,330
Just like when you see picture images
that are spelling out something to you,

484
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,070
um, to him as a, as,

485
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,670
or a liar or a visionary
was, uh, you know,

486
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,590
given this owl chemical symbol,
it United the symbolism of Alchemy,

487
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,250
of Christianity and of native Americans.

488
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:31,650
Now this is a unique synthesis. This is
what Joseph Smith did. Yeah. Joseph, well,

489
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,000
I con of graphically,
right? The Chameleon,

490
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,800
the tablets that you could go
back to Hermes, Trismus justice,

491
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,570
the emerald tablet, or you could
look at the, uh, the tablets of the,

492
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:50,430
um, did Jewish, you know, Moses
tablets you could look at.

493
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,140
So there's a, uh, the Rosetta stone,
all of these written in stone is,

494
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,270
it's a very powerful symbol.
Okay. So, uh, and the,

495
00:31:00,271 --> 00:31:04,740
the chameleon that, uh, doesn't, um, uh,

496
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,270
burn, you know, it's the,
it's an alchemical symbol. So

497
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,900
to us, the, the iconography,

498
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:16,901
the icon of a written and tablet is almost
like all sort of like profound ideas

499
00:31:18,531 --> 00:31:22,820
will come in that form or many will come
in that form because it represents like

500
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,030
almost in our DNA a represents
something of significance.

501
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,540
Wow. Those, um,

502
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:33,550
those aligned with this vision,
this higher vision,

503
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:38,170
granted an American,
this was like one of the earliest,

504
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,900
um,
religions along with spiritualism,

505
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,020
born in America.

506
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,580
Now there's a differentiation
because you have your Middle Eastern,

507
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,740
which is mostly everything comes out
of there and you go a little, uh, uh,

508
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:58,870
to the side and to India.
And, uh, uh, this, this is it.

509
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,660
It didn't happen over here
to our knowledge. Of course,

510
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:05,980
the native people were wise beyond anyone,

511
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,600
but no one was listening to them.

512
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,110
No one took them seriously
because they were all heathens.

513
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,820
And so they were murdered. We
move, we move to an awesome,

514
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,670
awesome place upstate Hudson valley,

515
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,240
the town of Wappinger and the
WAPA venture people 400 years ago,

516
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,100
people,
the east side of the river,

517
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,620
all the way down to Manhattan or you know,
loosely federated tribes.

518
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,180
And you knew that, that cause
you're from Jersey. The, uh,

519
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,390
the Hudson River used to
be called the [inaudible].

520
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,200
Connie took before Henry Hudson.
Whoa. The mall he, Connie took,

521
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,910
that's way cooler. Ah, listen to what
it means. Listen to what it means,

522
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:55,100
that, uh, the great flow
that goes both ways.

523
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:59,540
Ooh, because it's a tie. It's a
tidal river. It's a moon river.

524
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,620
It is polled back and forth all
the way up to whoppin chair.

525
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,700
Why would they want to change that name?
So beautiful?

526
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,390
Because Henry Hudson put his
big Dick, uh, in history.

527
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,320
Henry Hudson changes himself.
Well, he got a chance. Well,

528
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,150
he did establish the
white, uh, folk in there.

529
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:24,440
And there were a few friendly exchanges
between Hudson and the wappinger.

530
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,680
Some of the very first encounters with
native people where the Wappinger with

531
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,490
the, uh, with Hudson and he
reports on it. And there was a,

532
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,530
there was an unfortunate incident
where, uh, his men had killed, uh,

533
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:44,330
some, uh, you know, just in fear. And, uh,

534
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,920
they kind of were forgiving for one
night and I think they all got drunk.

535
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,590
And then,
uh,

536
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,640
then like a war ensued
over a hundred years,

537
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,720
the entire tribe was like wiped out.
Oh my God.

538
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:04,760
And it was the genocide of a people
practically at Nais fragmented,

539
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,360
uh, this, uh, beautiful people.

540
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,270
It was over a hundred years. Oh
man, it was relentless. And uh,

541
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,280
and so the last time were driven out,
uh,

542
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,760
like the Cyo to trail the
trail of tree of tears.

543
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,250
And I heard like clay at here,

544
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,110
this native American brother came to
us after we acquired this land and want

545
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:32,000
banter because he felt it was always
wholly to the WAPA. Pinchers and uh,

546
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,150
so, you know, we put a big, uh,

547
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,040
Karen to honor the wappinger spirit.
And um,

548
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,170
he,

549
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:47,170
he talked about what happened to the wop
wappinger and how they were walked out

550
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,230
like through Ohio. They
had to march, you know,

551
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,830
and uh,
as they were going through Ohio,

552
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:00,430
they passed right down high
street from where I was born.

553
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,560
You're a burden on high street. That's
where I'm from. No, no, in Columbus,

554
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:04,920
Ohio where I'm from.
Yeah.

555
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,720
And so I put a self portrait,

556
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,530
like as one of my crazy ass art projects,
you know,

557
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:17,240
really early on I used to
work for a billboard, the
billboard place, and I said,

558
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,990
please let me do this. It's a dead bored
anyway, you know, nobody cares. You know,

559
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:25,940
it's on high street. And it was a, a self
portrait, but with half my hair shaved.

560
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,120
And uh, so, but it was a huge, um,

561
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,670
billboard kind of thing. But with his head
with very ambiguous like what is that?

562
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,010
And, uh, so high street

563
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,460
was the trail of tears.
And at that point,

564
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,910
Evan said that number of the Delaware
Indians began to absorb the brothers and

565
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,320
sisters of the Wappingers so
that they found a solace there.

566
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,520
And there was something very interesting
about the Delaware Indians was that

567
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,340
they had a particular kind of haircut,
uh,

568
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:03,060
that was only for the warriors
in order to keep their, uh,

569
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,670
their bow out of the hair.

570
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:10,290
It was a cut in half side, uh, you know,

571
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:14,490
was shaved bald and the other half was
long. Here's the, a, a billboard actually.

572
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,490
Yeah, that's, I'm from a
Worthington. Holy Crap.

573
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,030
Hey neighbor, how you do it? Well,
people are from Columbus. It's funny.

574
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,670
Yeah. We've run into so many people from
Ohio, Maynard's from Ohio I guess too.

575
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,580
Yeah, that's a, that's wild man. So you
didn't even know that when you did it.

576
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,200
Hell No. I had to move to
wappinger to find that out.

577
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,850
That's crazy. Wow. What
a what a sad, sad story.

578
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,800
And you know,
we uh,

579
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,830
we spend so little time thinking about
the culture of the people that lived here

580
00:36:49,321 --> 00:36:53,370
before us.
It's so fascinating that we to on foot,

581
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,240
we want to honor them and um,
you know,

582
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,710
just say what,

583
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,880
what remarkable and a wonderful
people that they were.

584
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,910
Could you imagine mean if you have,

585
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,770
I mean I'm sure you have a match
because you live in this property.

586
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,820
If you thought about what it must have
been like to live there as them before

587
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:14,170
the white man arrived,
it must have been amazing there.

588
00:37:14,171 --> 00:37:19,171
It must've been like avatar except no
flying dragons notail sex about a lot of

589
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:20,820
it was like,

590
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,820
I mean they were literally living off
the land and they knew how to do it and

591
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:29,970
they were sustainable and they had great
reverence for the land. They lived off.

592
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,690
You mean the, they were missing a lot
of inventions that western Manhattan.

593
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:38,370
But man, I bet. I bet they were pretty
fucking happy. For the most part.

594
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,420
There's a, I was in Disneyland
yesterday, man. It's a dis.

595
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,190
There is a disturbing trend of people
getting so fat that they have to be

596
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,150
wheeled around. Did you see South Park
last week? Did the whole thing about that?

597
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,770
You will go crazy, dude, I will
go crazy because it was weird.

598
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,580
It was weird. It was. It wasn't. There
were injuries. You weren't injured people.

599
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,270
They were just, or if they were
fucking injured, it was from being fat.

600
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,590
These people were enormous and they
were pushing them around these other,

601
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:10,890
there was a these little scooter things
taking them everywhere. I guess the,

602
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,780
the morbidly obese have not had
a proper vehicle in the past.

603
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,960
Perhaps it's a tab out vehicle they give
up. They just give up on life like fog.

604
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,840
I'm just going to scoot around. There's
so many of them, man. I mean it wasn't,

605
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,720
it was, I don't remember
seeing this when I was younger.

606
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:32,190
I don't remember seeing these numbers of
morbidly obese people on motor scooters

607
00:38:32,191 --> 00:38:36,040
where they literally have
stopped walking like that. That's

608
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,660
too painful or they're too big to walk.
What,

609
00:38:38,661 --> 00:38:42,460
what has numbed people to the point where,
uh,

610
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,860
that is an acceptable behavior?

611
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,260
Is it the kind of crap that fast food has,
uh,

612
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,250
uh, gone to or, uh, you
know, as part of it?

613
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,013
What do you think?

614
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:56,821
Uh,
there's,

615
00:38:56,821 --> 00:39:00,510
there's certainly an issue with the
human body becoming addicted to unhealthy

616
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:04,860
foods. The look, me, myself, I
struggle with cheeseburgers and fries.

617
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:08,550
I love them. They're so delicious, but
I know it's like, it's super unhealthy,

618
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,650
but I try to limit it and then I put
a really healthy food in between that.

619
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,670
Some people don't do that.
They don't, and if you don't,

620
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,120
you can get caught up in this
addiction cycle was shit food.

621
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,720
Yeah.
I mean if you're,

622
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,670
if you know everybody who does that
artery read that, uh, old report,

623
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,260
you know, the change didn't. Yeah.

624
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,820
Yeah. Um, that's, that's a certainly a
good thing to read. But I mean, it's,

625
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:35,290
it's just, it's, it is weird.

626
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,650
The numb numbness is a good way
to describe it because it's just,

627
00:39:38,651 --> 00:39:42,910
you just keep eating and you don't see it.
You know, you don't freak out. You know,

628
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,620
it's like somehow slowly but surely,
he just get to this insane point and

629
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,390
well, I mean, I love Walt Disney.

630
00:39:50,391 --> 00:39:54,890
He said to me is an extraordinary
artist. And, and look at the,

631
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:55,640
uh,

632
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,620
amazing industry that's grown up
around and then the breakthroughs and,

633
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:05,690
and a motion picture technology,
all kinds of things that nature films,

634
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:09,690
you know, they, they used to
really, uh, deeply, uh, and, uh,

635
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,300
ubi works. Uh, they finally
are acknowledging his, uh,

636
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,800
you know, authorship basically it Mickey
mouse and things like that. So it's,

637
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:23,750
I think that they're an awesome
organization that has tried to, uh,

638
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,780
growing in a,
in a beautiful way and is a way,

639
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:31,781
a kind of the most generous a
representation of the Cherry on top of,

640
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:38,120
uh, American culture or something.
At the same time, you know, you like,

641
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:42,690
you really wonder like, well, well,
what does it actually mean? What is,

642
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,060
what is the religion of Disney as him
teaching us? Is it something about,

643
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,310
um, uh, passive observation
of reality, uh, and uh,

644
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,420
to,
uh,

645
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,730
kind of delight us with spectacles of our,
uh,

646
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,790
sort of delusional
understanding of certain things?

647
00:41:01,791 --> 00:41:06,600
Or is it actually playing a,
an important kind of moral, um,

648
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,490
role? And I think that for
the most part, you know,

649
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:14,180
it's been a very benign to very positive,
uh,

650
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:18,830
organization I think. And as a,
and as art, it's unparalleled.

651
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,500
You know,

652
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,360
they do have some amazing cartoons. Stop
and think about it like a, the sorcerer,

653
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:29,220
what was the, uh, the first one
called Asia antisocial. My premise,

654
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,370
amazing, amazing piece of work. And if
you really stop and think about the time

655
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,460
in which that was released, I mean,
there was nothing like it before.

656
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,850
It was so groundbreaking.
It's hard for people to really understand.

657
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,550
Was This 1930s? Is that what that was?
Yeah, the look, the rides are amazing.

658
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,870
My kids have an awesome time. I love
Disneyland. That's not what I, I've just,

659
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,920
I'm freaking out about humans.
The first of all,

660
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,030
the fact that Disneyland is so packed,

661
00:41:56,031 --> 00:42:00,950
it's crazy. So many human beings
in one area. It's incredible.

662
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,530
But, but you know what it's like,
it's like Faca for Americans. I mean,

663
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,190
is there anything else more Mac out
like in American wall of American?

664
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,710
Maybe but not really know
Disneyland is the spot.

665
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,600
Maybe a Disney world and Disneyland.
Yeah, those two. Yeah, maybe sea world,

666
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:21,500
but not even. No, no. Disney land.
It's like really where it's at.

667
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah.
It's incredible how,

668
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:28,790
and you know it was really kind of cool
about it was there's so many people

669
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,240
there. I mean it is insane. I never
saw one person raise their voice.

670
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,470
I didn't see one person get angry
with their kids. I didn't see,

671
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,740
I mean for as much as we like to talk
about the negative aspects of humans and

672
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,530
man lately on this podcast,
it's really been a bummer.

673
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,870
We've been having a lot of people like,

674
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,060
like reporters telling us about corruption
and the Congress people running for

675
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:56,900
Congress that are telling us about how
fucked up these new bills that are being

676
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:57,300
passed.

677
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,190
I mean you just over and over again you
keep hearing negative shit and we're

678
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:02,960
guilty of it too.
We were discussing it,

679
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,500
but when you go to Disneyland you
like all these people get along great.

680
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,920
Like look what's going on here.
They personally own positive vision.

681
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,100
Us a positive ability for all of us and
have always emphasized creativity as a

682
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,390
and the imagination as something
that is really important.

683
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,890
It's uh, it's amazing that they can
get that many people to be friendly.

684
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,250
You never hear about a gang fight
breaking out at Disneyland. No.

685
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,840
That's what kind of makes me mad though
with all those protestors though,

686
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:34,660
an Anaheim who are trying to
march to march towards that.

687
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,040
I kind of don't like that. I kind of
like, there's a lot of kids there,

688
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,850
you know? Why don't you just
get away from that? Yeah.

689
00:43:41,851 --> 00:43:43,160
I think they were trying to do that,

690
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,830
I think is that we get the maximum amount
of attention. Fuck with that. You know,

691
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,440
like if my kids there and you start
doing bringing that to my kids, fuck you.

692
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:53,530
You know?
Okay.

693
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,980
You shouldn't say fuck you because all
they're trying to do was called light to

694
00:43:56,981 --> 00:44:00,430
the fact that the kid was murdered by
a cob. Yeah. But you know what I mean?

695
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,270
Like don't bring it to her to that.

696
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:06,160
Why would you bring protests where
people are dressed up in military towards

697
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,370
kids? Well, I don't think when
they first started doing it,

698
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:11,170
there was no one dressed up in military.

699
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,150
That's how that happened
when they arrived.

700
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,530
So I think there's a little
bit of confusion there on
your part there, buddy now.

701
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,480
But I think just people
would just choose Anaheim,

702
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:23,190
but some things are that
are pouring then rides, man.

703
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,860
Some things are more important than rods
and getting people to pay attention.

704
00:44:26,861 --> 00:44:31,440
Kids are more important than everything.
All tech kits or hey listen to this.

705
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,060
Don't think this is hurting the kids.

706
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:37,440
I think there's only reason the only
violence was being thrown at the

707
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,650
protestors. The protestors,
as far as I know,

708
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,380
didn't or weren't accused
of doing anything violent.

709
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,080
It was the police that
were showing up with,

710
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,190
unfortunately if that shooting rubber
bullets like we saw with Amber Lyon when

711
00:44:50,191 --> 00:44:52,610
she was on the podcast, they
shot rubber bullets. I it.

712
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:55,410
But unfortunately you know how
there's going to be people,

713
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,740
especially like homeless people that
are joining these kinds of protests.

714
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,090
Just to be like fuck the police.
Cause I've, I saw it at, okay Brian,

715
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,073
what's a ship?

716
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,250
The thing where everyone sat outside
by Wall Street and occupy La.

717
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,650
When I went there I was like,
there's like a bunch of drunks,

718
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:13,740
a little different like this
and this was a community.

719
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:17,460
This particular instance in Anaheim
was a community responding to a murder.

720
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,610
It was violent. You know, they brought,
there was violence in Anaheim. It could,

721
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,500
there shouldn't be violence anywhere in
your kids. That's what I'm saying. Oh,

722
00:45:24,501 --> 00:45:27,240
can I see what you're saying?
But I think in this case,

723
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:30,870
if somebody's trying to do violence,
they weren't violent.

724
00:45:30,871 --> 00:45:33,180
The cops were violent towards
them. That's the accusation. Right?

725
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:37,120
As far as I understand it, you know
the, what we saw with that. Amber,

726
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,770
why just protests?
I don't know why he did eat it.

727
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,450
You thought about yourself innocent boy.
Why?

728
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,640
Because I was thinking about
how awesome Disneyland wise,

729
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,480
and I was like that when it was on the
last episode. I remember thinking that.

730
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,020
It is amazing.
But what I found fascinating about when,

731
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:53,400
one of the things that made me
smile when I was there, it was,

732
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,870
it really is amazing how well
people can get along if sort of,

733
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:01,830
gee, if the right kind of vibes
are generated and Disneyland,

734
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:03,840
it's like the exact right kind of vibe.

735
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,570
The only thing that
sucks is lines and lines.

736
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,770
Everybody just kind of laughs and jokes
around and kids play with each other.

737
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,740
That's not that big a deal. Hey
Man, that outlines very well.

738
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,260
Some kids complain and they say,
look,

739
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:18,510
we're going to have a great time when we
get on the Rod. It's going to be fine.

740
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:18,970
It's,

741
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,910
it's amazing how well people can get
along in that sort of environment.

742
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,300
People can say, well that's unrealistic.
Well, no, it's not unrealistic.

743
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:29,290
It's like we all cried

744
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,450
to get along, you know, instead
of think that, you know,

745
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:37,110
stepping outside of a place
like that, which I, you know,

746
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:42,090
say it one way or the other seems
a little more sacred to people. Uh,

747
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,060
and that may seem humorous in some ways,
but it's uh,

748
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,830
because it's focused positive. Yeah. Uh,

749
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,660
it's family oriented,

750
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,140
it a nondenominational and can be enjoyed.

751
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:00,720
And uh, you know, by, by anyone.

752
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:05,260
Yeah. It's a positive place. It's
fun. It's a fun place. But, and it is,

753
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,180
is sacred in that respect. It's
for, for children. It's such an a,

754
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,540
it's like a little religious experience
almost. Yeah. It's fun. I mean, it's like,

755
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,820
you see, it seems so much fun. See fairies

756
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,720
in places you see, you get a
taste of the visionary experience.

757
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:24,130
That's what they're trying to
create. It's a fully dynamic, uh,

758
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,430
pull you into a new way of seeing
reality kind of reorienting

759
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,220
experience. Yes. It's,
you know, it's like, oh,

760
00:47:33,221 --> 00:47:37,600
well we just want the temples to be like
this because they're so exciting and

761
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:41,320
they're so fun and they're, some are
a little too threatening, but summer,

762
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,510
you know, sit depending
on the age, you know,

763
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:47,320
and so you learn and you can grow and
you can go and visit these things and

764
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:50,200
enjoy them with your children.
It's a wonderful thing. We need,

765
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:54,040
the pool is very psychedelic.
Have you been on the Winnie the Pooh ride?

766
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,360
Oh my goodness. Winnie
the Pooh is, first of all,

767
00:47:58,361 --> 00:47:59,530
it's fascinating because my daughter,

768
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:01,540
she's only four and the
Winnie the Pooh was like,

769
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,110
have you get buckled down in this
thing and it's a slow ass ride.

770
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,560
So when w when it's over, she looks, when
she goes, why do we have seatbelts on?

771
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,840
She was like,
this is ridiculous.

772
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:13,540
Like a four year old is like you
don't need seat belts for this.

773
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,810
This is so stupid. Like why did
they make us it down? Um, but you,

774
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,770
you go through it and it's
all Winnie tripping. Okay.

775
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:23,980
Cause they do, they do it in
the guise of him falling asleep.

776
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:29,100
So when he is sitting there and then when
he ghost is doing flips like over him

777
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:34,150
and flips over him,
then we enter into this next room,

778
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:35,950
which is supposed to
represent Winnie's dreams.

779
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:40,630
And it saw neon tiggers knocked him over
and honeys everywhere and he's like,

780
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,420
this dreams amazing.
And he's literally in heaven.

781
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:48,570
I mean he's in this wonderful
psychedelic heaven where this like tiger,

782
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:53,700
who's neon colored completely like,
yeah, whole thing is white, you know,

783
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,730
lights. It happened in Dumbo
and it happened. Look, when you,

784
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,540
when you go through it,
when Winnie the Pooh has his,

785
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,440
has his psychedelic trip, like right
when he goes through and he falls asleep.

786
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,140
It's so obvious that like
acid based. Yeah. Yeah.

787
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:15,050
As mushrooms or something
there he starts tripping.

788
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,670
That's cool.
And then when he comes out of this dream,

789
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,000
you know, when he comes out of this, uh,
this, this falling asleep experience,

790
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,240
you see the next crazy room.
We look at this.

791
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:32,420
We need the pull is tripping his brains
off. This is a DMT trip. Look at this.

792
00:49:32,421 --> 00:49:34,820
Look at pink Tigger neon paint.
Take a look at this.

793
00:49:34,821 --> 00:49:36,110
About the fucker with giant orange,

794
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,610
orange heads and green arms
and honeys floating everywhere.

795
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,400
What is more psychedelic than this?
Look at this.

796
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,240
What the fuck are they trying to say?
This happens when you sleep.

797
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,110
It was just how many,
when you look at this,

798
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,950
if there's anything that's a psychedelic
trip, it is Goddamn Winnie the Pooh.

799
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,120
That should be the next thing. Kids
taking mushrooms and getting on the way.

800
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,990
The pool ride.
I bet you would freak the fuck out.

801
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:08,450
Just a pot cooking on this thing.
It's amazing.

802
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,450
That's great. Isn't that amazing? Wow.

803
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:16,360
That is clearly a psychedelic now.
So this is a walkthrough.

804
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:19,470
No, no, no, you're strapped in to,

805
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,520
my daughter was trying to express,
wow.

806
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,450
I tried to stretch a little bit
like a intestines or something.

807
00:50:26,451 --> 00:50:30,320
Like you're being in his
imagination. Yes. Yeah.

808
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,180
And then the pimps you out at the end.
Yeah.

809
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,710
Normal. Yeah. Yeah.

810
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:42,260
No of the human animal
fusion is an archetype that's
tens of thousands of years.

811
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,860
What do you, uh, what do you think
that is? What's the human animal?

812
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:51,740
Anthropomorphic being there.
They were standing up. Yeah.

813
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:53,420
Like human beings kind of,

814
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,240
and like your association with them was
person to person in a way, but they,

815
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,500
they represent the character
of that creature, you know,

816
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,420
in a more humanoid,

817
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:07,750
anthropomorphic talking kind of way.

818
00:51:07,751 --> 00:51:11,200
So that spirit in a
sense can speak to you.

819
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:14,800
Like you could be in contact
with other animal spirits,

820
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,820
but they would communicate to you and
in a certain language that you could

821
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,700
understand.
And so always,

822
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:26,701
I think the Schamens had been able to
have relations with these spirit beings.

823
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,170
And some of the earliest
cave art actually, uh,

824
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:37,260
of male figures are so cold sourcers
like the sourcer of Troy Fair.

825
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,820
And, uh, it is a, a horned, uh,

826
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,550
kind of deer type, uh,
being that is also, uh,

827
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,310
a man. Clearly I've got a penis. And, uh,

828
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,540
and so it's a fusion,
uh,

829
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,820
images of it online. Oh yeah. Right.
Can you find that the sourcer of Troy,

830
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,750
t, r I. S and then two,

831
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,550
or why us Frere. T. F. R.

832
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,740
E. R. E. S.

833
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,230
Don't guess,
if you didn't get the name

834
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:22,150
of Troy for air,

835
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:24,690
um, what do you think that is?
So you think that these are real,

836
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:27,900
real beings of these people were coming
in contact with through psychedelic

837
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:28,740
experiences.

838
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,990
It, it's possible, you know, and that, um,

839
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,750
or it's a portrait of the sourcer,
uh,

840
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,840
that is an integration of,
of yeah.

841
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,070
Of Human and animal qualities.
Now this is an enhanced,

842
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:50,780
uh, version of, it looks very similar
to that, but it's on the side of a cave.

843
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,800
And so they would,
um,

844
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,080
go into the code. The real one, Brian,

845
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,100
that's what they did is they traced it
so he could see what it actually looks

846
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,240
now. That's still amazing,
isn't it? So, so that whole arm,

847
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,040
there you go. So the archetype, wow,
that's the real one. Yeah. That's amazing.

848
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:13,540
That is amazing. It tells you quite
a few things. It tells you, uh, the

849
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,120
Shamonic, uh, you know, um,

850
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,770
x Ray Vision,

851
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,310
that is an ancient kind of quality of
vision that sometimes you appear to be

852
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:31,191
able to see through to the lifeline
are to the underlayment of the fabric,

853
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:35,910
of the body, of the physical
body to it, another kind of body.

854
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:40,911
But here it's mostly the fusion of the
human and animal archetype can see he's

855
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:42,420
got a Johnson

856
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:45,830
down there and I love his eyes.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Isn't he awesome?

857
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:50,080
Completely awesome. Oh yeah. Yeah.

858
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,210
I got that business.
I got you like Matt Tail.

859
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,660
Yeah. He's like letting you
know. Yeah. Right. I know, but
he's not hard. So he's not,

860
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,370
no, no. Exactly. He's not needed. Yeah,

861
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:08,210
I can look behind. What
a strange, very strange.

862
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:13,640
What is, what is that getting out
sweet duty? That's a weird little,

863
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,700
it looks like a little mushroom.
Maybe it does. Maybe it is.

864
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:20,420
It's at mushroom up his ass. Could be
most of them coming out of his ass.

865
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:24,860
That's controlling his mind. Wow. I'm

866
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,280
sorry. How old, uh, can
you look at check the date?

867
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,840
I think it's at least 16,000,
16,000 years old. Yeah. They,

868
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:35,270
you know,
the most stable civilizations.

869
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:40,271
I think we're from the earliest a work
of art that I know of is this amazing

870
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:46,060
picture. I'm sure you've seen
it, of this goddess that, uh,

871
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,520
made out of mammoth ivory and it
looks like Dolly Parton or something.

872
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,730
It's an amazing, uh, you know,

873
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,750
buck some goddess and

874
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,530
it's so, uh, archetypal
it 40,000 years ago. Okay.

875
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,580
So they were still,
uh,

876
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,930
having these figurines like the Venus of
Willendorf and things like that tens of

877
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:15,650
thousands of years later.

878
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,090
Now there isn't a civilization on earth
that was more stable than the goddess

879
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:24,350
worshiping cultures. They were
agricultural. They were stable,

880
00:55:24,351 --> 00:55:26,690
sustainable relationships with nature.

881
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,550
Is it just that human beings get to a
certain level of technological proficiency

882
00:55:31,551 --> 00:55:34,070
and then they just start to fuck
each other up really easily.

883
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,260
And that's when things go wrong.
Well,

884
00:55:36,261 --> 00:55:41,261
I think that there was a
remarkable breakthrough in
human consciousness that led

885
00:55:41,361 --> 00:55:45,920
to, uh, a cerebral, uh, kind of,

886
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,810
uh,
you know,

887
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:52,811
fire of intelligence that led people to
begin to write and to write in such a

888
00:55:55,521 --> 00:55:59,030
way that,
that they could commune with the Gods.

889
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:02,660
The earliest books were all
religious texts, you know,

890
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:07,550
6,000 years ago, you know, the
vedic hymns can the rig Veda,

891
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,810
you and you know, that's got
references to Soma. The, uh,

892
00:56:11,811 --> 00:56:15,220
the most ancient of these, uh, uh,

893
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:20,090
psychedelic Brahma better than Indra.
Exactly. And connects us with the,

894
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:23,530
uh, immortality and, and uh, infinite,

895
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,880
no one knows by the way, what's so
my, it was correct. Exactly true. Now,

896
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,970
a lot of different people have
different consents, uh, conjectures,

897
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,890
I have no idea, but it
was clearly a kind of, um,

898
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:42,040
NT agentic a sacrament that allowed
people access to the realm of the divine.

899
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:45,200
One of the things that Mckenna said,
Terrence Mckenna.

900
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,870
So that was so fascinating to me.
And so when,

901
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,920
when you really stop and think about
the history of human culture and

902
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:53,060
psychedelic usages,

903
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:58,090
how could something that was so powerful
where they talked about it with great

904
00:56:58,131 --> 00:57:00,500
reverence and their scripts,
how could that have gone away?

905
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,340
How could people forgotten what that
is? I mean, that's, it's amazing. Well,

906
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,780
we're very distractible

907
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:10,740
and, uh, we are not certain about the, um,

908
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:14,430
kind of, um, the game that we're in.

909
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,690
Is it an ego game or is,
uh,

910
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,770
or does love when the day, and, uh,

911
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:28,130
can you find your own
personal connection with,

912
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:33,330
uh, the creative source, you know, and,

913
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,033
uh,
if,

914
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:40,250
if your life is an opportunity for your
soul to read the tea leaves of your

915
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,660
reality and,
uh,

916
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:48,600
see whether it's in alignment with
your heart's purpose, you know,

917
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,420
uh, I mean, that's,

918
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,130
that's one of the other great reasons
that entheogens or sacraments or

919
00:57:56,131 --> 00:58:00,930
meditation or Yoga and
meditation or any of,

920
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:01,380
uh,

921
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:06,030
many different ways of
accessing the imaginal realms.

922
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:11,460
I mean, making art is,
uh, that to me. And,

923
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,250
uh,
so as a spiritual practice,

924
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,710
thank you.
As a spiritual practice,

925
00:58:19,711 --> 00:58:22,650
I think it has a much
in common with prayer.

926
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:28,550
If your artwork is in service of love
and truth and goodness and beauty,

927
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,980
and that would birth a new kind
of sacred art as well as these,

928
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,091
the access,

929
00:58:39,091 --> 00:58:44,091
the now verifiable and repeatable access
to the visionary dimensions provided

930
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:51,120
by, uh, entheogens, which has
happened in numerous cultures,

931
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:52,560
including the Greek culture.

932
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:57,240
We have the foundation of Eastern
civilization and the vedic hymns,

933
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:02,220
uh, mentioning a psychedelic. Then
we look at the Greek tradition,

934
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:05,100
uh,
and the Eleusinian mysteries,

935
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,790
also a 1200 year old
rubbish. And that's er, uh,

936
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:13,910
and civilization really pretty long
time actually for civilizations and very

937
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,530
profoundly important. And all the
philosophers that we're familiar with,

938
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:24,531
Plato and Aristotle and Socrates would
have been initiates and the Eleusinian

939
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:28,090
mysteries. And so, uh,

940
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,310
these great thinkers that
form the foundation of,

941
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:35,420
of Western civilization had to haul,
uh,

942
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,430
taken a psychedelic and
uh, enabled them to, um,

943
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:43,190
commune with the Gods and with the ideals.

944
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:47,390
That's why Socrates whole
platonic forms or you know,

945
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:50,450
that he talks about the ideal realms,
uh,

946
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:55,160
that he describes are him clearly
and contact with a visionary reality.

947
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:59,750
One of the most famous tales about
Socrates is he walking across this square

948
00:59:59,751 --> 01:00:02,930
like he did every day and he
stopped in the middle of the square.

949
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:07,931
He just like started talking
and arguing with this.

950
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,200
Um, Damon, he called it
his Damon and this was his,

951
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,260
this visionary being that he
communed with and had a day long,

952
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:22,330
24 hour exchange with in the
middle of the public square watts.

953
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,900
Yes.
He was crazy.

954
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,860
He was high as fuck.
It was crazy.

955
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,560
He might have just come back
from the Eleusinian mysteries,

956
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,140
ran to arrest him today. If
someone did that, they would,

957
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:39,170
but they knew he was frickin
sock gritty's they already knew,

958
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:43,950
give him space. And of course,
well, you know how he wound up,

959
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:48,470
you know, he was martyred. He, you know,
they didn't want him around, you know,

960
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,980
he corruption of the youth. And
uh, so he had to drink this poison.

961
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,910
Did he have sex with
a bunch of young boys?

962
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:59,850
It wasn't that also part of
his thing. What was, uh, uh,
I, you know, you could say,

963
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,670
where's the verification?
Right.

964
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:07,470
And where's the notion that that wasn't a,
uh,

965
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:12,470
something that was mutual and wears?
Just say that some of the gay, uh,

966
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,440
artists weren't the greatest and
art history, like Michelangelo,

967
01:01:16,441 --> 01:01:21,300
like Leonardo,
does their gay nes suddenly make them bad?

968
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:25,890
I don't care if they did. Fuck, no,
I certainly does. But you know, it,

969
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,490
you know, might be an interesting
sidebar about history. Well,

970
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:31,260
that's what I was getting at.
Like what was it,

971
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,270
what was different about life back then?

972
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:36,060
That was like a really common thing
that men will have sex with young boys.

973
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,410
And even if it was a,
um,

974
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,700
a mutual thing where
it comes into question,

975
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:44,640
that's when obviously when you talking
about like really young people that you

976
01:01:44,641 --> 01:01:48,150
can't really have a
mutual, you know, if you,

977
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,880
if you look at the ideals
that Socrates spoke of

978
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:57,890
truth and goodness and beauty and being
in contact with the ideal realms where

979
01:01:58,201 --> 01:02:00,960
you commune with these, uh, you know,

980
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,760
angels and you get
communication from the highest,

981
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:11,160
you don't, uh, go about messing
like that. That happens at the,

982
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,240
at the kind of a perversion of,
you know,

983
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:19,650
what the intention of God is,
I believe.

984
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,330
But in terms of, of, uh,
reaching, uh, you know,

985
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:29,550
like he, he was, uh, just, he
was interested in what was just,

986
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:34,440
you know, he wasn't interested
in, in, uh, molestation.

987
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,190
So you feel that those are just false
charges against him or do you tap the

988
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:43,830
Austria is just tower he's going for, if,

989
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:44,341
you know,

990
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:49,341
what we like to do is trash all of our
heroes to make them as low as possible so

991
01:02:50,131 --> 01:02:55,050
that you have no hope about
human character. And I think
that's shame. I have not.

992
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,180
I did not look at it that way.
When I heard this read this, I, I,

993
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,310
I kept hearing about this and many,
many civilizations.

994
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,910
I mean obviously the Greeks are famous
for the Romans were famous for it as well,

995
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:11,060
and my point was merely that was
sexuality viewed as a completely different

996
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:14,010
thing. I've been, the way we
view it today, I'll play. Yeah.

997
01:03:14,011 --> 01:03:18,510
I think it's more that there was going
a molestation thing, I think are,

998
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,180
we're very repressed whether
we believe it or not,

999
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:23,490
and I'm not saying you should
start having sex with young people,

1000
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:27,330
but we are incredibly repressed when
it comes to sexuality I suppose.

1001
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:32,510
And I wonder if back then it was
just the ideal was different.

1002
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:37,420
The, the, the, the literally the way you
thought of life was different and it's,

1003
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,400
I think it's very hard for people.
I think you're right. Yeah.

1004
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,900
I think it's very hard for people
to wrap their heads around that,

1005
01:03:42,901 --> 01:03:46,080
especially if it comes to something
as controversial as, oh my goodness,

1006
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,830
it's still, you have to be a check.
Look at different, if you're,

1007
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:54,330
if you're on an anthropology
article, uh, kind of, um,

1008
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,390
fan and you really look at
different world cultures while yes,

1009
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,920
you can see they've all got one head,
two arms,

1010
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:08,910
two legs in general,
and have two sexes and uh,

1011
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,150
come in a variety of colors and uh,
things.

1012
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:17,150
But there are many different cultural
practices that work uniquely for each

1013
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:21,780
little niche of a human
civilization or culture.

1014
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:25,480
And it's astonishing
really. Yeah, it's, it's,

1015
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,210
it's different in different Crinod
I'm sorry, in different times,

1016
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,531
you know,
oh,

1017
01:04:31,531 --> 01:04:36,531
we believed this then and then now we
don't do blood letting so much anymore.

1018
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:41,000
You know, what haven't
we done? Well, um, how,

1019
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,720
how fascinating are you,
uh,

1020
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:47,750
by the Maya and the Mayan culture and
there if there was ever a culture like so

1021
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:51,420
severely obviously impacted by
psychedelics. It's really true.

1022
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:54,760
It's like the whole culture.
I went to Chichen Eatsa,

1023
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,980
I had a really, uh, educated, uh, guide.

1024
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:02,800
It was a guy who was a local professor
who took us around and you know,

1025
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,760
he taught like more openly than
I've ever heard anybody talk.

1026
01:05:05,761 --> 01:05:06,750
Cause I didn't even ask him.

1027
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:10,920
Started talking about the psychedelic
drug rituals that they have and where they

1028
01:05:10,921 --> 01:05:14,070
would have of an explained
was a chocolate and mushrooms.

1029
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,070
I don't know what it was. I believe
it was [inaudible] he froze the flesh

1030
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:23,070
of the gods and they mixed the
chocolate and the mushrooms,

1031
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,470
which has done to this day.
It's delicious.

1032
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,030
Chocolate is so good for you too
by the way. I end. Yeah. Yeah.

1033
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,060
Never had people who will never ever be
like raw cocoa, raw chocolate. Especially.

1034
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:38,650
It's so, it's super high in
antioxidants. Like, you know, like,

1035
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,030
well it was suicide but it has
also gotten, uh, the, uh, the,

1036
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,780
I think the greatest endorsement
from the scientific community.

1037
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,610
The Johns Hopkins Study.
Yes.

1038
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:53,611
It corners and Ron Griffiss and
it confirming basically the same,

1039
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:56,880
uh, uh, discovery from the Good Friday.

1040
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:59,710
Cause maybe you can talk some sense into
my friend Brian then because my friend

1041
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:04,510
Brian has done mushrooms a bunch of times
and he doesn't see any transformative

1042
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:07,870
nature to the drug.
You think she's just taking go?

1043
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:11,300
I think the first time
you, you, uh, take it,

1044
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,060
it definitely opens up something in
your brain and makes you look at things

1045
01:06:14,061 --> 01:06:16,430
different.
But that will always stay open.

1046
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,520
But I don't think anytime I
take mushrooms from now on it,

1047
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,460
it might be something positive and
I'm on my gain something from it.

1048
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:25,460
But it only like a week or
two later I'm back. You know,

1049
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:29,660
I'm not like thinking about that one trip
I did two weeks ago and how much it's

1050
01:06:29,661 --> 01:06:33,320
changed my life. I'm more like, all right,
what's going on? You know, moving on,

1051
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,850
you know,
like it's never

1052
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:40,200
have and you haven't properly integrated
it then my friend because uh, and,

1053
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:42,270
and actually,
uh,

1054
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:47,330
dousing of one's consciousness into the
infinite is well worth considering about

1055
01:06:48,001 --> 01:06:52,050
how it relates to your everyday
reality. And, uh, what,

1056
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,640
what does it say? You know, what is
the nature of consciousness? Who went,

1057
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,380
who are you ultimately, and what, uh,

1058
01:06:59,430 --> 01:07:03,280
what does God want a view basically.
Yeah.

1059
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:07,980
And I believe that your, you know,
your entire life is, uh, is uh,

1060
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:12,570
basically, uh, an expression of
that. You know, it's a natural thing.

1061
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,280
That's why we call,
you know,

1062
01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:19,080
art our religion or
creativity in any form is,

1063
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,080
uh,
this sacred thing.

1064
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:24,480
And because it's an expression of ourself,

1065
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:29,730
this unique lens through which
the creative spirit passes,

1066
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:34,210
not him.
Nah,

1067
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:39,210
it's a wizard of Oz on mushrooms
with pink Floyd sinked up.

1068
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,220
It's not like that, but that's the
cartoon level, man. That is like, I mean,

1069
01:07:44,221 --> 01:07:46,650
if you have any interest in this,

1070
01:07:46,651 --> 01:07:51,120
don't trip again until you read Stan
[inaudible] work. He's not reading shit.

1071
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:56,580
Well, you see, if you, if you want to get
the most out of an experience like that,

1072
01:07:56,610 --> 01:08:01,610
a real opportunity to drop into infinite
love where you and God become one,

1073
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:06,930
uh, you know, you beat your own
God self. It is possible. But,

1074
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:09,720
uh,
in Roland Griffiths study,

1075
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,830
it was a those who,
um,

1076
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:18,950
actually we're interested in
contact with spiritual reality,

1077
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:22,070
uh, who had an intention, uh,

1078
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,250
about it spiritually inclined. People, uh,

1079
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,720
were the ones who were
opened up 65% of the time.

1080
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,490
Now each of them thought it was a positive
experience. Not all of them, you know,

1081
01:08:34,491 --> 01:08:38,140
got all the way to the mystical
experience, but the mystical experiences,

1082
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:39,950
something pretty well defined.

1083
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:44,240
And once a person actually
has that experience,

1084
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,000
it's um,
it's affirmative.

1085
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:52,070
It's so affirmative that you
reorient your life to relate to it.

1086
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:56,000
And it may not change your outer
appearance of, of your life,

1087
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:59,690
but it may empower it in some
way with hope and you know,

1088
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,510
new kind of creative dreams that,
you know,

1089
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:06,320
where's your creative flow coming from?
It's not just cashflow, it's got to be,

1090
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:11,630
you know, connected with, um, whatever
you feel like your creative spirit is. I,

1091
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,030
you know,
I have no problem with the word God,

1092
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,640
but a lot of people
have trouble with that.

1093
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:20,780
But I think that it's a legitimate way
of thinking of your relationship with a

1094
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:21,800
spiritual reality.

1095
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,680
Just to play devil's
advocate and you know,

1096
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,080
only so that we could answer the
question. When you, when you, you,

1097
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:31,880
you talk about these people that wanted
to have this experience and then had the

1098
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:33,810
65% of them,
I mean,

1099
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:39,110
how much of what we're talking about is
real and when you go into it with good

1100
01:09:39,901 --> 01:09:42,840
intentions to have some sort
of a visionary experience,

1101
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,030
how much of it is your imagination?

1102
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,990
How much of it is your
imagination acting with a,

1103
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:52,620
a hallucinogenic drug to produce this
euphoric state that you think is visionary

1104
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:55,020
contact or some sort of spiritual contact?

1105
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,170
And how much of it could just be your
imagination mixed with drugs and this is

1106
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:03,120
what you were looking for.
So your imagination created it for you.

1107
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:08,270
And I'm not saying that that
is bad or good because I don't,

1108
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,690
I have a feeling as I get older,
this makes more and more sense.

1109
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:14,550
Even though it's harder
and harder to talk about,

1110
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,410
I have a feeling that things
are neither real nor not real.

1111
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:24,300
I have a feeling that the, the way we try
to define things in such simple terms,

1112
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:29,610
it, I don't, I don't necessarily think
that the imagination is not real.

1113
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:34,410
I think the imagination has
some sort of weird impact.

1114
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:39,560
The mine detention and the creativity has
some sort of a weird impact on reality

1115
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:44,520
of course. So that's what that is
the evolutionary edge of reality.

1116
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:48,270
That creative spirit
is evolution in action.

1117
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:52,280
Is that weirdly defined when you use
the word God, weirdly defined eye,

1118
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,120
that's God's paintbrush. You
know, w who created all this,

1119
01:10:57,121 --> 01:10:59,760
not you are or me. You know, how much of,

1120
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:04,820
of all of the spectacle of reality
did we really have a part in creating,

1121
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,440
right? You know, but when you say
it, when you're saying, God, I,

1122
01:11:08,441 --> 01:11:11,560
I completely agree with you
that that is the most, uh,

1123
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:13,830
the most beautiful way to God.

1124
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,540
And probably the most,

1125
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:20,570
if there is some sort of an overwhelming
power to this creative force,

1126
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,650
they all describe the,

1127
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:29,180
this sacred a reality as a
creative force. And uh, it,

1128
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:33,540
uh, at the first moment, you
know, and it's the declaration,

1129
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:36,600
let there be light.
Let there be, you know,

1130
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:41,580
it's that it's the positive
affirmation of the creation, you know,

1131
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:45,360
like what is it,
13.7 billion years ago,

1132
01:11:45,361 --> 01:11:50,361
there was an affirmation that took
place and where the living result of it,

1133
01:11:50,371 --> 01:11:55,371
the evolutionary wave has brought us
to this moment and it's an awesome,

1134
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:58,650
awesome thing if you really
look at it, you know, you know,

1135
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,770
4 billion years of evolution
on earth practically and,

1136
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:06,780
and from blue green algae to human
beings gibbering at each other on a radio

1137
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:07,710
podcast,

1138
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:12,950
holy and we are to the future just like
Amoebas are absolutely no question about

1139
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:17,430
a tiny,
one of my question was when I said does,

1140
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:21,450
does it weirdly define it to use the
word God because the word God to a lot of

1141
01:12:21,451 --> 01:12:25,410
people does not mean that too. A lot of
people, and probably most of the world,

1142
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:25,980
the world,

1143
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,790
the word God means a deity who created
the earth and did it with certain

1144
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:33,270
intentions and has rules that you have
to follow or there will be repercussions.

1145
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:36,920
It's a completely different kind of God
than what you're describing. Well, it's,

1146
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,310
it's, um, if one would
give themselves the,

1147
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:46,490
the pleasure of being introduced
to the various faces of God,

1148
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:49,550
you know, it's that, uh, to uh,

1149
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,570
expand their mind beyond
the any dog don't,

1150
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,260
uh,

1151
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:00,260
really submit to the authority of any
religious dogma until you've examined

1152
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:05,530
reality and it has to jive
with science. You know, your,

1153
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:11,120
we have awesome tools now for actually
analyzing reality and measure shit.

1154
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:16,910
So don't leave that out or, or
discounted or anything like that. And,

1155
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,370
and uh,
so it has to have a sense of justice,

1156
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,840
all the rest of the things
that religion has always had.

1157
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:30,230
And that's why if we enacted our
creative spirits in the service of love,

1158
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:36,000
and that's what happens at Disneyland,
you see that,

1159
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:39,540
that there's a lot of love
and families to come what may,

1160
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,360
and they yell at each other and they
don't get along and they're bitter and

1161
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:42,840
whatnot,

1162
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,550
but maybe for a few hours they can suspend
themselves and just delight in being

1163
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:51,450
together. Uh, having a
visionary experience. It's,

1164
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,600
it's a kind of a drop down visionary
experience that takes you outside of

1165
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:59,250
yourself.
You get pulled in,

1166
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:04,520
you lose your ego for a moment and join
in a collective imaginal experience.

1167
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:07,020
And by the way,
ladies and gentlemen,

1168
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:11,070
if you're playing the Joe Rogan experience
drinking game and you drink every

1169
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,870
time someone says the word
experience today, you're dead.

1170
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,330
You're not going to make it. Don't play
this shot. Stop it. Don't play this game.

1171
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:23,710
Um, my, my just point was
that the word God has already,

1172
01:14:23,711 --> 01:14:26,140
it's like so many people.

1173
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,930
I absolutely agree that,

1174
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:32,590
that your concept of God must evolve.

1175
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:37,120
It can't be stuck in a fundamentalist,
a definition.

1176
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,320
Just like our definition
of religion as Bob Jesse,

1177
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:46,090
my dear friend who, uh,
council on spiritual practices,
he said, Alex, you know,

1178
01:14:46,091 --> 01:14:50,440
there's a, a, a primary
religious experience

1179
01:14:52,450 --> 01:14:54,820
and then there's everything
else, you know. And,

1180
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:59,821
and so the primary religious experience
was this contact with the divine.

1181
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,080
And, uh, that was at
the heart, the mystic.

1182
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,370
Every one of these world,

1183
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:10,780
we said eastern and Western civilization
started with psychedelic reality.

1184
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,480
Okay. Then look through all
the major world religions.

1185
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,370
They all started with this visionary
experience. You know, uh, uh,

1186
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,810
Moses sees a burning Bush with the
guy next to them have seen at burning.

1187
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:27,040
I don't think so. It was his
neurons that were burning. He was,

1188
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,860
he was ignited with this voice of God.

1189
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,480
And with this experience of this fire,
not unlike Joseph Smith's fire,

1190
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,321
a fire,

1191
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:40,321
which is a visionary fire and know that
Jerusalem scholars have recently started

1192
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:45,580
attributing that to a
psychedelic experience. Oh, well,

1193
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:51,250
there's actually science behind it.
Apparently. The acacia tree, Aha. DMT

1194
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,800
that Bush the Acacia Bushes, very
common in that area. The burning Bush.

1195
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:59,230
He talks to God.
He finds out how eventually shit,

1196
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:03,370
the DMT trip was the foundation
of this, uh, uh, Jewish.

1197
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:08,140
I'm completely messiah.
Nothing like nothing. What
was the man growing out there?

1198
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:09,730
Man? It's going down.
It's a good question.

1199
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:14,670
Was that the growing on the sacred calf
that they were worshiping because like,

1200
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:19,830
hey man, we eat the stuff, the goose
poop. You knew? Well, yeah. I mean,

1201
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,930
no question. That was, uh, not, not that,

1202
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:26,440
just that cows were worshiped because
of that. There was a sacker. They were,

1203
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:27,420
you know, the, they,

1204
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,030
they didn't eat them because they were
worshiping them because they created

1205
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,300
these, these mushrooms that would let
them communicate with God. Exactly.

1206
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:37,840
There can be no clearer when you're
talking about poor people in India,

1207
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,960
there could be no clear example
of an entheogenic being a,

1208
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:47,990
a connection to God that
then you literally don't
kill these animals that you

1209
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:53,770
could use for food. You literally
start, but you do milk them and it,

1210
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:58,480
and it's of interdependent,
kind of symbiotic,

1211
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:02,470
um, positivity, you know,
for each one. And there's a,

1212
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:07,650
a friendship not to develops between
the creature world and the human world,

1213
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:12,560
this sense of comradery
with the creature world.

1214
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,670
But in her case,
the actual creature in Disneyland,

1215
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:21,530
we don't experience these creatures
all the time. We live in the cities.

1216
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,230
We forget about our
connection with the creatures.

1217
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:28,460
And so a trip to Disneyland may
remind you, even if, uh, you know,

1218
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:31,380
in a anthropomorphized way,
um,

1219
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,180
but they have really been working on
that too. They'll go down a, you know,

1220
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:37,770
an open, uh, as zoo, uh,

1221
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:42,710
element and try to try to care for
animals because they're part of the human

1222
01:17:42,711 --> 01:17:43,990
story.
The,

1223
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:49,090
the animals are branches
on the evolutionary tree
that we're in relationship

1224
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:54,221
with in this mighty evolutionary patchwork
that is the mycelium of consciousness

1225
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:59,490
on the earth that's runs
through everybody. It is
pretty fascinating that we,

1226
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:03,650
I mean, humans for the most part, think of
animals. You think of your dog, your cat,

1227
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:07,310
and then some shit that's in a cage
somewhere that you can go stare at or

1228
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:08,990
something that you can watch on the DVD.

1229
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:14,260
But it really is fascinating when you
stop and think about the vast majority of

1230
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:18,590
animals on this planet are not
us. Like, this is not our planet.

1231
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,450
We are on this thing.

1232
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:25,250
We've just figured out how to build these
really stunning structures that keep

1233
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:27,940
them out for the most part.
But he has, like, there's,

1234
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,500
they've been spawning
coyotes in Manhattan lately.

1235
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,800
They've had several coyote
spottings in Manhattan. Wonderful.

1236
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:38,730
Schamens coyotes are, yeah. So the cat
eaters, that's what they are. Yeah.

1237
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,640
And rat eaters may be, and they're
coming in for help. You know,

1238
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,940
and it's interesting to see
who thrives and who, uh,

1239
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:52,370
declines in the animal populations
in these really difficult times.

1240
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:56,630
I'm afraid we're going through
mostly caused by humans.

1241
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:59,570
And as far as like the polluting,
of course,

1242
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:04,010
the heating up of the
atmosphere and the, and the, um,

1243
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:08,180
political suicide and, and,
and, you know, it's like,

1244
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,080
I feel like,
uh,

1245
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:15,170
it's the mighty mission of art to try
and uplift humanity beyond itself.

1246
01:19:15,171 --> 01:19:16,550
Destruction.
You know,

1247
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:21,530
this is why all creators need to
really consider the ethical, um,

1248
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:25,990
Stan that they're taking
in their culture and, uh,

1249
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,710
not just, uh, be like
soldiers of fortune. Uh,

1250
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:33,110
if you're selling your soul that cheaply,
you know,

1251
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:38,090
if you're not taking people to some kind
of creative source and positive force

1252
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,880
that is at the heart of
their own creative spirit.

1253
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,950
If you're not trying to ignite and uplift
a people souls, what are you doing?

1254
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:51,020
Why are you doing it? What about people
that would just try to be entertaining?

1255
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:54,230
Is that uplifting someone's
soul? I mean, it should be IP.

1256
01:19:54,710 --> 01:19:59,570
Is it always at the expense of someone or
we, are we always making fun of people?

1257
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:04,580
Is that the highest that we can reach
for in terms of our, of our, uh, I mean,

1258
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:08,280
it doesn't hurt to disarm are kind of,
uh,

1259
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:12,450
pompousness, you know, to
try and knock down everybody.

1260
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:17,570
I think that there's positivity
in that, you know, so that
we're, you know, less, uh,

1261
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,270
less pompous.
Uh,

1262
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:24,730
some of my favorite humor is people
getting shit on cars. I so do I,

1263
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:28,670
and we love the drama Kinison
and, oh, he's amazing. And, uh,

1264
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:32,940
my friend Joey d is just yell at
people for serving them ranch dressing.

1265
01:20:32,941 --> 01:20:37,830
It's very negative, but it's hilarious.
It stirs things up. Well, you know,

1266
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:39,470
we split off fiction. It's, it's,

1267
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:43,030
it's like watching a movie with
fake violence in it. You know,

1268
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,780
it's like watching people get
killed by Werewolf's. You know,

1269
01:20:45,781 --> 01:20:48,870
it doesn't really freak me out because
there's no where Wilson, it's not real.

1270
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:53,910
I enjoy it. It's fun. It's
just a silly created piece of
art. It's a ride, you know,

1271
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,180
and it's, you know, it's obviously
it's, somebody has expenses.

1272
01:20:56,300 --> 01:21:00,020
That guy who fucked up and
went in the basement, that
guy gets it, you know? Yeah.

1273
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:03,720
But it still, I still enjoy
it. What does it feed in them?

1274
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:06,420
What does that feed in comedy?
What is it?

1275
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:10,170
What does it feed in the human soul?
Well,

1276
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:13,650
it gives the human soul and escape for
a short amount of time and get some to

1277
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:16,200
think about how ridiculous
something that someone just said,

1278
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:19,860
even if it's really negative,
how preposterous and ridiculous it is,

1279
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:24,600
especially done in the form
of standup comedy. And uh,

1280
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,870
for me,
I just enjoy it as an art form.

1281
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:32,460
I enjoy offensive comedy as an art form.
Like I enjoy Andrew dice clay.

1282
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:37,320
I think he's hilarious. I treat him
like I treat a band that I enjoy.

1283
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,180
I like what they're doing.
I like what they're doing.

1284
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:41,760
It's fun for me or you not zip.
It's a work of art.

1285
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:45,990
It's certainly not if I wanted to talk
to him as a human being and that was what

1286
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:49,230
his point of view on life represented.
No,

1287
01:21:49,231 --> 01:21:53,090
he's saying a bunch of shit that is really
silly and he's doing it to, you know,

1288
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:56,010
in this character, cause he's knows it's
funny, he knows what he's doing. He's no,

1289
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:58,860
he knows how to make
you laugh and it's not,

1290
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:03,780
there's a big difference between that
and it representing his life philosophy,

1291
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:08,940
representing who he is, the person. It's
art, you know, stand up philosophers.

1292
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:12,420
Yeah, we do. And we don't. We
also just need comedy. You know,

1293
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:16,920
there's plenty of philosophizing
going on in this podcast. You know,

1294
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:20,580
if I applied this amount of
philosophy to my standup, I'd fucking,

1295
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,750
no one would show up that people
would go to sleep after a while.

1296
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:28,560
They built to come to command someone's
attention for an hour and 10 minutes.

1297
01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:32,400
You have to be funny and you have to
work on being funny and it's like you,

1298
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,330
you can't have,

1299
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:36,300
there's a certain amount of philosophy
that people will upset except,

1300
01:22:36,301 --> 01:22:39,990
and certain amount that if you try to
get a point across, you have to throw in,

1301
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:43,050
you know, you, you really have to
explain people where you're coming from.

1302
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:46,560
But the beautiful thing about the
podcast is when I was younger,

1303
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:51,120
I always thought that like one day I would
have like a message, like as a comic,

1304
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:52,050
you know the,

1305
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:56,310
my comedy was so juvenile and ridiculous
and it's a lot of it is about sex and

1306
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:58,720
stupid shit and I was like,
well someday I'll, I'll,

1307
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:03,300
I'll evolve my comedy to the point
where it's like it's got like a message

1308
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:06,130
because I admired certain
comics that had that.

1309
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:10,000
But then as I got older and especially
as I started doing the podcast,

1310
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:12,250
that became less and
less interesting to me.

1311
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:15,430
Like I don't want to hear your
point of view through stand up.

1312
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,293
It's just the same way.

1313
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,390
I don't want to hear a complex
idea described through a song.

1314
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,700
I want you to tell me,
tell me what you're really thinking.

1315
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:26,020
And they explained to me over with
all the words possible in the most

1316
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:31,110
descriptive and intricate and
objective and subjective way possible.

1317
01:23:31,421 --> 01:23:34,050
I want you to explain it
to me with your own work.

1318
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,210
And you do that just through standup.
It's eliminated medium.

1319
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:39,790
It's not what it's for. It's
for. It's for cracking jokes.

1320
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,330
It's for making people laugh or if
it it's, it's at someone's expense.

1321
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,550
The way I feel like it's tough shit.

1322
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:49,450
You should be able to take the hit if
you're not looking at this instead of

1323
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:51,220
feeling so serious about it.
Not only that,

1324
01:23:51,221 --> 01:23:55,510
I don't think it's good to enforce the
idea that people should be so fucking

1325
01:23:55,511 --> 01:23:57,970
sensitive when it comes to
people communicating about them.

1326
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,080
I think there's far too many people that
get butthurt too easy in this country

1327
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:04,240
and this world and this in this universe.

1328
01:24:04,420 --> 01:24:08,170
I think we have to be able to make fun
of things and you have to be able to

1329
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:11,710
laugh at your own self. Right?
And when you, when you say, oh,

1330
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:15,080
is it someone else's expense?
Sometimes they need that shit sound.

1331
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,870
Some people are ridiculous.
All right.

1332
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:21,850
Some people will look for every fucking
opportunity to cry or be negative or

1333
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:25,180
whine about shit or do something stupid.
And those people,

1334
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:30,190
I think it's culturally, it's important
to knock them down. It's important.

1335
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:34,240
It's important to all laugh together
and it's important for them because if

1336
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:37,990
they're doing ridiculous behavior and
you highlight that ridiculous behavior,

1337
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,510
it benefits them because now
they get a chance to see that,

1338
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:42,250
oh everybody thinks I'm a fucking dummy.

1339
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:47,580
That's part of how we evolve consciousness
by becoming conscious of something

1340
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:52,200
that appears to be a wrongdoing.
And if they can't accept that they,

1341
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:55,840
all they're doing is dragging their
heels behind the evolution train.

1342
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:56,531
That's what they're doing.

1343
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,900
They're kicking at the dirt
trying to slow down the train.

1344
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,720
They don't want to evolve themselves.
So they don't want to have anything.

1345
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:05,620
Cause if you're making fun
of them unjustly, guess what?

1346
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:09,070
It won't be funny if there's no
work, there's no truth. Your words,

1347
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:14,190
it won't spontaneously make people laugh
because you've spoken a truth that no

1348
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:17,890
one will say. And it scares the
crap out of people. You know,

1349
01:25:17,891 --> 01:25:22,720
like when Bill Hicks would let loose on
things, you know, it was like, oh my God,

1350
01:25:22,721 --> 01:25:26,920
can he say that? He said that, you know?
And every time he would say something,

1351
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:30,070
you know, it was like, oh, oh my God, I
didn't know I was going there and there.

1352
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,640
And it was a genius,
you know, of, of uh, uh,

1353
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,980
carving territory. But he also,
if he, even if he painted hell,

1354
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:43,210
he painted a little bit of heaven
too. And I love that about him. Yeah,

1355
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:47,470
he really did. He had some great points
that weren't necessarily even funny,

1356
01:25:47,471 --> 01:25:51,380
but he wanted to make them when he,
when he was doing certain bits and,

1357
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,160
but he was so interesting that
he carried it anyway. You know,

1358
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:57,670
he had this like thing that
he wrote down, uh, look, uh,

1359
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:01,180
the bill Hicks rules for standup or
something like that. I forget what it was,

1360
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:03,980
but one of them was,
I'm paraphrasing

1361
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,730
it that you didn't always have
to be funny. Just be interesting.

1362
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:10,820
Like there's sometimes you,
you, you use the funny,

1363
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:13,010
you get the funding there and then
you could tell him something that is

1364
01:26:13,011 --> 01:26:17,380
entertaining for a brief moment. Just
not necessarily funny. You know, it's a,

1365
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:21,380
it's a tricky thing to do in stand up,
especially at not be preachy.

1366
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,130
That's where shit gets annoying for
people to go see a comedian and they get

1367
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:26,920
really preaching. Yeah. Yeah.

1368
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:31,100
Because it's the intoxicant of the stage,
you know,

1369
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:34,700
you're allowing people to have a massive
amount of control over the influence

1370
01:26:34,701 --> 01:26:37,330
that they have on you
to stand up on top with,

1371
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:42,350
with a big spotlight on you and an echoey
voice and you know, magnified voice.

1372
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:46,870
All of that is ridiculous.
So because you're in this situation there,

1373
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:51,500
there comes a time where a lot of
people do things just because they want,

1374
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,090
they want people to think they're smart,

1375
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,540
they do things just because this is going
to get a big impact. This is going to,

1376
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:58,670
and then they got to start getting
really preaching. And that's what it is.

1377
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:02,970
It becomes disingenuous. You lose
this connection with the comic Ma.

1378
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,720
I saw a lovely Tom on do something
extraordinary, you know, like,

1379
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:08,510
uh,

1380
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:12,860
signs of intelligent life on earth or
something like that or that was very good.

1381
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:16,490
And, uh, even, you know, even though, uh,

1382
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:22,270
it came out of love and self reflection
and that kind of thing is really rare

1383
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:28,520
and I'm, all I'm doing is saying all
of culture is necessary and every,

1384
01:27:28,521 --> 01:27:33,080
the freedom of expression as as a
guaranteed absolute, I think in the,

1385
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,373
uh,

1386
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:38,870
and it's the only way that the creative
spirit can feel free enough to do

1387
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:43,280
anything and to explore, uh,
and evolve into territory.

1388
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:48,020
But if you're going to
then call it something like
sacred art or if you're going

1389
01:27:48,021 --> 01:27:49,760
to try and reintroduce,

1390
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,960
cause my wife and I had these mystical
experiences and what are you going to do

1391
01:27:53,961 --> 01:27:57,300
then? Oh, I think I'm just going
to make art about the marketplace.

1392
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:59,810
Cause that's the only thing that's
going on these days. You know?

1393
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:03,410
Or maybe I should do some kind of vulgar,
uh,

1394
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:07,960
transgressive thing to really
make a spectacle and things are,

1395
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:11,690
or maybe I should, uh,
critique corporate, uh,

1396
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:16,880
vacuity or something like that.
No, the mystical experience.

1397
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:20,530
That's the most important thing.
And throughout history, uh,

1398
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:24,020
see the reason that Bob,
Jesse said,

1399
01:28:24,230 --> 01:28:28,190
I don't give the fundamentalists
the word religion.

1400
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:32,450
It's, you know, then, then, okay,

1401
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:37,310
you can't evolve that concept. It's
too important to concept to let go of.

1402
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,340
And uh,
so you have to evolve it.

1403
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,520
You have to take it on and say,
okay,

1404
01:28:43,521 --> 01:28:47,960
there was a primary religious experience
that was the mystical experience that

1405
01:28:47,961 --> 01:28:50,990
was the visionary experience
that contacted, uh,

1406
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,960
such as the Moses moment or
these various kinds of things.

1407
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:57,650
Those things recur and
they continue. And, uh,

1408
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:02,280
so there is a contact with a sacred
reality. And if we look at love,

1409
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:07,830
just people still believe in
love and they feel it from Ah,

1410
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,580
they're kids and thinks now that
means love is a cosmic force,

1411
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,720
God or Creator,
whatever name you want to say,

1412
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:19,380
or just the big bang
brought us. And in a, uh,

1413
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:23,030
if anybody looks at, uh, the, uh,

1414
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:27,900
amount of intelligence that it
goes to create a cell, you know,

1415
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:30,960
Dr. Hoffman, Albert Hoffman, uh,

1416
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:34,800
discover of LSD use to, uh, talk about,

1417
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,040
do you think it would be possible for the
parts of a cathedral to be laid out on

1418
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:44,730
a football field and to assemble
themselves into a cathedral?

1419
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:51,000
Now, uh, you think of the unlikelihood
of that even given the, you know,

1420
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:56,060
like an infinite time and you know
that it takes intelligence to build a

1421
01:29:56,401 --> 01:29:57,234
cathedral.

1422
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:03,020
And he said a self reproducing cell is
much more difficult to construct than a

1423
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:08,430
cathedral. And it is done in such a, um,

1424
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:12,710
my microscopic way that,
uh,

1425
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,860
you have to,

1426
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,170
I a good scientist would
simply infer that, uh, the,

1427
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:20,910
uh, intelligence, uh,

1428
01:30:20,911 --> 01:30:24,920
that constructed the
universe is at work in,

1429
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:28,300
in so many systems that we see around us.
And uh,

1430
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:30,030
you would even if you,

1431
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:35,120
part of your small mind is absorbed with
the daily bullshit that comes floating

1432
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:40,020
by you're a screen and you get upset
about it and you get hooked into your

1433
01:30:40,021 --> 01:30:44,430
emotions and all that stuff
on the background reality.

1434
01:30:44,431 --> 01:30:48,150
If you could just lean away
from the bullshit and, uh,

1435
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:51,660
tap into the infinite,
that is always there.

1436
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,010
The divine creative spirit
that really turns people on.

1437
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,340
That's the thing that people want to
experience. The ecstasy of creation,

1438
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:00,480
you know,

1439
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,440
and when you're even gardening or when
you're cooking a new kind of soup,

1440
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:08,990
or you're being creative, you're
happier. You're not thinking about the,

1441
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:12,120
the thing that she said you are,
the,

1442
01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:14,400
or the thing that he did or,

1443
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:17,700
or how terrible the world is
or anything like that. You're,

1444
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:22,910
you've transcended the
chatter of the mind,

1445
01:31:23,310 --> 01:31:24,180
Bruh.
You know,

1446
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:29,720
briefly and entered a creative flow that
is an intuitive flow that is just a,

1447
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:34,980
just a plane of consciousness, higher, uh,

1448
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:37,530
than the most of the current,
uh,

1449
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,050
video screens that people are tapped into.

1450
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:45,440
So if you could just begin to lean away
from that mental stuff and back into

1451
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:51,450
the, the, the creation that brought
us here, then you'd see like,

1452
01:31:51,451 --> 01:31:56,040
wow, okay, things aren't really
so fucked up actually, you know?

1453
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:58,020
Okay.
So we blow it.

1454
01:31:58,350 --> 01:32:02,450
Look at the magnificence of this,
um,

1455
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:04,480
intelligent,
uh,

1456
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,990
evolution to a point where we have,

1457
01:32:08,050 --> 01:32:11,200
even though we don't know what
reality is and it, and it,

1458
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:15,730
this part of the imagination and
consciousness, these are great mysteries.

1459
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,110
That's, you know, that we
are God speaking to God.

1460
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:21,660
We're consciousness.
Uh,

1461
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:25,780
speaking to consciousness
is the way that I see you.

1462
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:28,210
You're tapped into so many networks.

1463
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:33,390
You're part of a wider intelligence that
in circles the globe and that listens

1464
01:32:34,151 --> 01:32:37,360
avidly for your independent,
uh,

1465
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:42,100
advocacy for points of view that
are very marginalized in society.

1466
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:47,310
It's an extremely important stand to
take as a cultural hero to many that you,

1467
01:32:48,570 --> 01:32:52,780
uh, uh, we'll acknowledge certain
things that are not popular,

1468
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:55,390
but you feel it's important to say.

1469
01:32:55,960 --> 01:33:00,820
So your work comes from a place of the
heart and a place of justice and a place

1470
01:33:00,821 --> 01:33:05,821
of a kind of righteous understanding
of the multiple dimensions that we all

1471
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:09,310
dwell within.

1472
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:10,720
Well, it also, my,

1473
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:15,750
my point of view comes from a person that
feels that like how I know myself and

1474
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:21,650
my, uh, tendencies to,

1475
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,670
to get in bad patterns in my own life
and how I've overcome that and how I've

1476
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:32,650
sort of molded my mind and changed
the way I thought about just reality,

1477
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:34,720
my interactions with human beings,
all these things.

1478
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:38,290
I know that I'm not unique
in my ability to do that.

1479
01:33:38,291 --> 01:33:42,010
I know that a lot of people have done
that. I can do that and are doing that.

1480
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:45,240
And one of the things that's
been the most positive, uh,

1481
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:49,750
benefit of this podcast for sure is
running into so many people that have said

1482
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,580
that listening to these conversations and,
and,

1483
01:33:52,581 --> 01:33:54,880
and taking in these
different points of view,

1484
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:58,690
these well-considered points of view has,
have actually benefited their lives,

1485
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:01,810
changed their lives. People are eating
healthy. Isn't that awesome? Exercising?

1486
01:34:01,811 --> 01:34:02,340
Yeah.

1487
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:06,550
It's direct to transformation.
It's, it's the, um,

1488
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,930
I guess the fourth quadrant of how,
uh,

1489
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:14,220
art and a podcast as a work of art.
Yeah.

1490
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,470
It's not only visually
beautiful, but, uh, you know, uh,

1491
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:21,820
Brian's been weaving in the sound effects
and that it's a work of art that's not

1492
01:34:21,821 --> 01:34:24,480
art. Don't tell him that.
Sorry. Okay. Okay. But doing,

1493
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:26,920
I don't want to inflate anyway,
but I'm saying

1494
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:31,610
hour. We'll just be none of that.

1495
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:34,970
Don't, don't, don't, don't encourage
them. Oh, you son of a bitch.

1496
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:39,710
He's got the Shaman's rattle. That
is the Shaman's rattle. Right?

1497
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,440
Is it shaman or Shaman? Uh, I've,

1498
01:34:42,530 --> 01:34:45,380
I've used both at varying times.

1499
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,990
Yeah. It's a tricky one.
It's like Bahrain, Bahrain.

1500
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,950
Um, so you're, you're, you,

1501
01:34:54,951 --> 01:34:58,400
this gentleman who you quoted
about the use of the word religion,

1502
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,520
don't give it up to the fundamentalists
who feel the same way about the word God.

1503
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:04,640
It's like, don't give it to people
that have a narrow definition of it,

1504
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:08,150
just use it, use it.
Even though there is a

1505
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:12,380
standard definition that a lot of people
sort of think, oh, your religious,

1506
01:35:12,381 --> 01:35:15,290
are you a Christian sir?
Do you believe Jesus is your savior?

1507
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:16,490
And then things get strange.

1508
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:19,000
Well that,
yeah,

1509
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:24,030
the ideology can in small in
us and it absolutely does.

1510
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:27,190
And so, uh, the real religion,

1511
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:32,460
the primary religious experience
is direct contact of self with God.

1512
01:35:33,910 --> 01:35:37,030
Now that is still valid and important.

1513
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,580
And then the ability to let go and
reach these strange realms of higher

1514
01:35:43,041 --> 01:35:47,060
consciousness that are available with
and without help from any sort of

1515
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:51,830
entheogens. Absolutely. Prayer and
meditation alone as the Royal Road,

1516
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:55,970
you know, uh, the mine is very variable.
It's very variable in its frequencies.

1517
01:35:55,971 --> 01:35:59,960
It's very variable in where
you can take it. And, uh, my,

1518
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:02,630
my own experiments with
a [inaudible] experience,

1519
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:07,490
a part of my life is isolation tanks.
A huge part of my,

1520
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:08,830
my development as a human,

1521
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:13,480
that's a fabulous kind
of late 20th century, uh,

1522
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:18,550
uh, addition to spiritual
practices. And unfortunately really,

1523
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,940
really, uh, found it.

1524
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:25,490
And he was one of the psychedelic
fathers of, um, this, I,

1525
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,633
I see,

1526
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,160
by the way, I should say something about
Lilly, but just came out today. They're,

1527
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:31,790
they're showing me on Twitter.

1528
01:36:31,791 --> 01:36:36,230
It's going crazy to ketamine
used to cure depression. Wow.

1529
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,380
They're saying that it's one of
the most effective, cute uses of a,

1530
01:36:39,381 --> 01:36:41,630
a cures for depression.
They've vibraphone really

1531
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:46,540
simply one dose.
One dose has an impact at Saint John.

1532
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:50,210
They were saying that for sure,
but, uh, you know, uh, I don't,

1533
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:53,990
I don't know exactly what they're
claiming all he have vitamin B,

1534
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,350
vitamin,
fabulous proponent of ketamine.

1535
01:36:57,650 --> 01:37:02,360
My God, I, well, you know, ketamine
has an interesting kind of, um,

1536
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:07,100
shadow side to you that I've
seen. Uh, it's very dumb, yeah.

1537
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,470
For people. And I, uh,

1538
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:14,500
I never saw that in the classic hose
and agendas that were psilocybin or,

1539
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:18,440
um,
even LSD or DMT.

1540
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:23,300
They're not really addictive in the,
in the, uh, kind of strict sense.

1541
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:28,700
So Ketamine is one of those
interesting new substances.

1542
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:29,820
Uh,

1543
01:37:29,820 --> 01:37:34,820
it was extensively studied and the 60s
and the Vietnam War and used actually as

1544
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:39,320
a battlefield and Dickerman and uh,

1545
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:44,360
then a small amounts of it snorted or
smoked and various things like that take

1546
01:37:44,361 --> 01:37:48,460
people into these dimensional,
I,

1547
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:53,240
it's kind of like a catapult for your
consciousness. It goes flinging out, uh,

1548
01:37:53,241 --> 01:37:57,210
if you're laying down, uh, uh, into, uh,

1549
01:37:57,330 --> 01:38:01,770
what seems like a very rapid motion
of your consciousness going very fast,

1550
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:04,920
even though you're laying
down and over a texture,

1551
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:09,270
a kind of a vast texture. And, uh, we,

1552
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:13,910
we had these kind of
openings into the void, uh,

1553
01:38:13,911 --> 01:38:18,420
that were very profound and
very, uh, heart opening in a way.

1554
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,760
It is a, um, a horrible club drug though.

1555
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:26,870
It's used very sparingly and it
should be treated with great respect.

1556
01:38:28,260 --> 01:38:31,640
I know, but yeah, I never heard a, uh,

1557
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:36,660
like I had a number of, of
friends. I never got into it,
frankly, you know, I d uh,

1558
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:41,480
we were injected with it I think a couple
of times, like back in the 70s. And,

1559
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:45,190
uh, it was, uh, you know, it
was an available thing and, uh,

1560
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:50,000
and a psychiatrist gave us
that experience and it was, um,

1561
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,470
it was profound.

1562
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:55,540
My friend Todd Mccormick,
do you know Todd marijuana activists?

1563
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,860
Very interesting guy.

1564
01:38:57,490 --> 01:39:02,490
He got injected by John Lilly himself
with ketamine in Lily's isolation tank and

1565
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:08,120
he went deep and he was, he's kind of
freaking out in the town. So Lilly shoots,

1566
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:12,010
he shoots ketamine into himself, gets
it another tank and goes and visits him.

1567
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:14,590
Whoa.

1568
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:16,580
Yeah.
What that is,

1569
01:39:17,010 --> 01:39:21,780
that is high tech shamanism is high
tech shamanism that, uh, you know,

1570
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:22,321
hey,

1571
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:27,321
I ventured into the coincidence control
here that I'm not familiar with and

1572
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:32,580
it's, I'm really freaking out. And, uh,
so I mean, he might've even, uh, had to,

1573
01:39:32,581 --> 01:39:33,750
uh,
you know,

1574
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:38,400
pay a little something to his
buddies who run the machines,

1575
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:42,270
uh, to, uh, get his friend back.
What would you, what happened?

1576
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:46,030
What a piece of your consciousness
would you have to give up? Oh, uh, no.

1577
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:49,650
It was just like a, hey,
hey, I'll give you my sex.

1578
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:55,530
I'll give you my sex. Yeah. Those
change from male to female. Really?

1579
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:56,543
John Willy,

1580
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:00,630
he changed from male to female. I believe
he did it. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

1581
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:04,080
So you're saying that my friend Todd
McCormack in his irresponsible use of

1582
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:08,760
ketamine now, so now you just said, well,

1583
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:12,860
I don't mean it. I'm just fantasizing.
Is that like a dude that dude,

1584
01:40:12,861 --> 01:40:16,680
did he do that? I don't think
it had anything to do with
your friend at all. Okay.

1585
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:21,390
Uh, it was for him, I'm sure, and
have a creative evolutionary step.

1586
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:23,250
So Ketamine,
essentially,

1587
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:27,270
he marched toward the divine
feminine and embraced it.

1588
01:40:27,660 --> 01:40:28,770
That's interesting.
Well,

1589
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:32,220
a lot of people believe that that is
the number one problem with the world is

1590
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:36,210
the expression of the fact of
the divine feminine. Absolutely.

1591
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:40,950
The fact he was Austrian exists in the
intelligent life form that is evolving

1592
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:44,560
past pass through the, the,
the actual form of the,

1593
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,100
that we recognize matter in,
into a nuclear haves. Like what,

1594
01:40:49,390 --> 01:40:52,920
what else was he then,
if, if people are profits,

1595
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:54,550
if people are profits

1596
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,443
of something,

1597
01:40:55,720 --> 01:41:00,720
he was a prophet of transformation and
the use of all technology available for

1598
01:41:03,131 --> 01:41:08,131
accessing the human bio computer
and a coincidence control.

1599
01:41:09,070 --> 01:41:13,570
Right. And so he really
believed in a spiritual reality,

1600
01:41:13,571 --> 01:41:18,430
but it was a completely informed by a
Rica and all the rest of the systems that

1601
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:20,680
he was familiar with.
But I think a very legitimate,

1602
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,230
and one of the most densely
detailed descriptions from, uh, uh,

1603
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:26,343
you know,
uh,

1604
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:30,880
this trans dimensional
realm that we currently have

1605
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,850
and his incredible invention
of the isolation all night.

1606
01:41:33,851 --> 01:41:36,140
God was such a brilliant,
brilliant invention. Yeah.

1607
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:40,720
He was trying to figure out
how to separate the mind
from the sensory input of

1608
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:45,070
the body and he couldn't get there with
meditation, couldn't get there with yoga.

1609
01:41:45,071 --> 01:41:48,310
He couldn't, couldn't quite get there.
He was always conscious of his body.

1610
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:51,640
So he figured out how to do this in the
first sensory deprivation tank was like

1611
01:41:51,641 --> 01:41:55,240
a scuba tank or you had like a,
a helmet,

1612
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:57,880
scuba helmet and you would
float like from your neck.

1613
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:03,220
They use that in an altered states, you
know, to uh, describe initially the first,

1614
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,070
it was pretty chronological
in that respect.

1615
01:42:06,071 --> 01:42:07,930
They started off with that sort of a once,
right.

1616
01:42:07,931 --> 01:42:10,720
And then went to the horizontal once
they figured out how to use salt in it.

1617
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,690
But his old ones, he used to have
like waste evacuation systems. Yeah.

1618
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:17,410
Well he would shit and Piss
in the tank for a long, long

1619
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:20,530
time. You know, the uh, you know,

1620
01:42:20,531 --> 01:42:24,770
because he was interested in long
term immersion. Yeah. And uh,

1621
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:29,770
this was basically a replication of
something that had been done for many

1622
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:31,270
centuries. I'm sure you're
familiar with it. You know,

1623
01:42:31,271 --> 01:42:36,271
the young teat practice and a Tibetan
Buddhism is all about the dark retreat.

1624
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:41,710
You go into the dark and uh, yes, uh, uh,

1625
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,101
you know,

1626
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:46,060
all these things that he talks about
that you're still dealing with gravity,

1627
01:42:46,061 --> 01:42:49,210
blah, blah, blah. Uh, but
the intention is the same,

1628
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:54,360
to remove all distractions and
to be surrounded by darkness.

1629
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:59,430
Well, I wouldn't even call it a
distraction to be awake. Um, you know,

1630
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:04,660
and you could lose consciousness of
your body so much and are able to access

1631
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:06,970
your imagination.
Now,

1632
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,960
Ibn Arabi thought that at,

1633
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:14,710
and he was a Sufi mystic.
Uh, my favorite, uh,

1634
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:19,490
your favorite Sufi missed tab 10 wow.
Room.

1635
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:21,640
He wouldn't be right next to have cars,
you know,

1636
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:26,590
but Eben and Robbie was the most scholarly
and he called the imagination your

1637
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:30,400
angel.
That is the place where God meets God.

1638
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,550
And so, uh, that,

1639
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:38,500
that is the visionary
mystical experience that,

1640
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:43,180
uh, runs through all world
religions and he details it.

1641
01:43:43,480 --> 01:43:46,570
And there are celestial hierarchies that,
uh,

1642
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:51,440
Plotinus describes in exactly the
same way they had a cross cultural,

1643
01:43:51,680 --> 01:43:55,220
although they were writing it at
different times. It wasn't dissemination.

1644
01:43:55,221 --> 01:43:59,390
It was all direct knowledge.
And, uh, so these were,

1645
01:43:59,420 --> 01:44:03,560
these were people that were getting
it from the highest, uh, command.

1646
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:05,810
And it came through there.
Um,

1647
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:09,110
it came through their unique
lens of their language.

1648
01:44:09,111 --> 01:44:14,111
And so they each had unique prayers to
be in contact with this creative force.

1649
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:15,733
And,
uh,

1650
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:20,360
he really did emphasize the
sacredness of the divine feminine.

1651
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:24,830
And he's, yes, no [inaudible]
been a rock. And, uh,

1652
01:44:24,831 --> 01:44:29,180
so the great mystics, I've quite often
done the same thing, you know, I mean,

1653
01:44:29,181 --> 01:44:33,980
what do we have more art of a
goddess sculptures, you know,

1654
01:44:33,981 --> 01:44:38,570
the goddess is the symbol of
beauty as symbol of love, uh,

1655
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:42,710
for humanity. And although it gets
perverted and things like that,

1656
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:46,730
if you step back and just look at
the flow of art history, you know,

1657
01:44:46,731 --> 01:44:50,180
back from the 40,000 years ago to today,

1658
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:55,480
what is celebrated the beauty of
the divine feminine and a worshiped,

1659
01:44:56,690 --> 01:44:59,750
really, really, truly new age. Shamanism,

1660
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:04,160
the creation of this sensory deprivation
tank is the creation of something that

1661
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:08,420
allows you to take this practice of
solitude and darkness to a completely new

1662
01:45:08,421 --> 01:45:13,280
level and literally remove the body,
remove the body from the equation. And,

1663
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:17,930
uh, Lily Korea, you're still aware
of the smell and you're still aware,

1664
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:22,400
but it's much less. Not really cause
all factory sense is only detect change.

1665
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,780
As long as you don't Fart in the tank,

1666
01:45:23,781 --> 01:45:26,970
you're not aware of the smell because you
won't be aware of anything. Yeah. Your,

1667
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,750
your, your nose will stop receiving any
changes in see the one you've got? Yeah.

1668
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:34,340
It's a, it's is created by this
guy, a crash from the float lab.

1669
01:45:34,341 --> 01:45:37,090
A float lab is in Venice and it's
the best place in the country. Wrong.

1670
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,560
He's a really mad scientist
when it comes to it.

1671
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:42,040
There's the filtration
systems that he uses or the,

1672
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:45,230
the highest standard and he's pushing
for like an industry standard to try to

1673
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:49,880
get people to start taking these things
seriously as far as like how you can

1674
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:52,650
clean the water to make sure that
you could use them commercially. Yes.

1675
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:54,140
We know lots about,
have you,

1676
01:45:54,170 --> 01:45:59,020
have you been to Munich and to the float?
Uh,

1677
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:01,850
experienced though? I've never been
to Munich and, well maybe I have,

1678
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:05,930
well it was in Germany. I forgot where I
was actually. Sorry. It was for a fight.

1679
01:46:06,050 --> 01:46:09,650
What happens is you go
into this huge tank,

1680
01:46:09,651 --> 01:46:11,390
it's like a king size bed,

1681
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:16,420
but bigger of water and
eight inches deep I guess.

1682
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:21,700
And so you lay down and it's the salt
and it's really warm and nice and it goes

1683
01:46:23,991 --> 01:46:28,790
down to a very, you know, like ultra
marine blue doesn't go totally plaque.

1684
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:32,240
Oh. And there's, and you can close
your eyes and most of the end,

1685
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:35,480
and it doesn't change at all and it's,

1686
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:39,860
it's just the most pleasant,
uh, an amazing, uh,

1687
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:42,170
it relaxation kind of experience.

1688
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:46,850
And he's woven it into the German
businessman. Now they, you know,

1689
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:50,070
on lunch hour they'll come in and say,
wow

1690
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,210
man, I really need to unwind. And it's,

1691
01:46:52,211 --> 01:46:54,990
let's just like a half hour
later they're like, whoa.

1692
01:46:55,170 --> 01:46:58,170
It's just like they were meditating.
It does wonders for me,

1693
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:03,060
especially after I do Jujitsu classes
and I'm exhausted and strained out.

1694
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:06,660
They'd like, it lengthens your
body, like your, your, your muscles.

1695
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:09,740
They contract and tighten it up.
And what I mean by lengthen is,

1696
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:14,590
is they relax and sort of extend the,
they relax and pull away.

1697
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:15,050
Like it,

1698
01:47:15,050 --> 01:47:20,050
everything feels like it sort of just
takes a big deep breath like all of your

1699
01:47:20,581 --> 01:47:25,510
tissue. Like Ah, ah, it relieves
so much tension. It's it,

1700
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:28,500
by the way, it also, it
benefits your body. Um,

1701
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:32,760
it's one of the best sources of
magnesium because I'm at the magnesium is

1702
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:35,540
entering your body through
the Epsom salts and your skin.

1703
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:39,830
It's actually very healthy for you.
Very interesting. We know the, uh,

1704
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:44,870
the filtration system that they
had was unique and patented.

1705
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:49,260
John Daly's no, the one
in Germany, in German.

1706
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:53,580
And they were, they saw themselves
as continuing to work. You know,

1707
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:57,000
John's obvious, you know, uh,

1708
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:59,750
invention and uh,
uh,

1709
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:03,250
move it forward also in a
similar way to your friend, uh,

1710
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,270
is doing out there in Venice.
That sounds like a great idea though,

1711
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:09,510
to have just a really light blue
so you can even open your eyes.

1712
01:48:09,511 --> 01:48:13,290
And just the idea of doing it for
as a short term relaxation thing,

1713
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:17,070
that would be very pleasant.
It's, it's extremely uplifting.

1714
01:48:17,071 --> 01:48:20,610
And probably the caller has something
to do with it. You know, I love blue,

1715
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:24,870
like a for professional pool.
They found out that the color,

1716
01:48:24,871 --> 01:48:27,120
they'll a light blue,
a light calming blue,

1717
01:48:27,121 --> 01:48:31,170
like a blue sky is like the best
color for seeing objects around it.

1718
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:34,980
As far as like seeing edges, the edges
of the ball and things like that.

1719
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:38,510
That light blue is what it
really just a appeals to the eye.

1720
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:41,730
I use these two things. It was green,
it was green for the longest time,

1721
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:46,650
but now they uh, they go with light
blue. That that feeling. Yeah,

1722
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:48,860
the feeling of floating also,
um,

1723
01:48:49,240 --> 01:48:53,700
the release of all the input that's
coming in from the body allows you to take

1724
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:54,960
in information better.

1725
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,040
And what crash has been working on over
at the float lab is what he calls a

1726
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:00,750
cellular influenced device.

1727
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:05,490
And the idea behind it is it is a screen
that is fits in front of your, your,

1728
01:49:05,491 --> 01:49:07,980
your visual peripheral,
like from here to here.

1729
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:13,370
And it is the lowest emission of
light that's physically possible.

1730
01:49:13,501 --> 01:49:17,730
So you literally don't see the
edges of the, the television at all.

1731
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,350
You see nothing other than
whatever is being broadcast.

1732
01:49:21,370 --> 01:49:24,600
They figured out how tuned that in.
It took him years to figure this out.

1733
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:29,620
And he has these speakers that are in
the water literally on either side of

1734
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,600
right here.
They're all,

1735
01:49:30,601 --> 01:49:34,980
it's all sealed up and so
they're underwater and you're
in this thing and first

1736
01:49:34,981 --> 01:49:38,790
of all, the sound moves, the
water, it pulsates the water.

1737
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:43,770
So you feel the sound, you feel his
toes. He, yeah, you do whatever you want.

1738
01:49:43,771 --> 01:49:47,030
I mean, would crash is trying to do
is get people to start coding, uh,

1739
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:48,070
documentaries

1740
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:48,881
and uh,

1741
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:53,080
instructionals to it cause he thinks it
will speed up learning by a staggering

1742
01:49:53,081 --> 01:49:53,914
amount.

1743
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:59,410
That's a remarkable it to
immediate kinesthetic. Um, yeah.

1744
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:03,440
Uh, kind of taking it on a
cellular level in farming your,

1745
01:50:03,490 --> 01:50:05,110
your cells all over.

1746
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:09,940
And also the retention is
just far stronger and greater
because the fact there's

1747
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:12,810
no distractions while it's going
on. It's the same as, I mean,

1748
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:14,890
in theory this all needs to be tested.

1749
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:20,130
But I can tell you that as far as just
your sheer horsepower for concentration,

1750
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:24,700
to me, there's never been anything like
it in my life other than psychedelic

1751
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:28,510
experiences. But I consider it a very
psychedelic experience. And you know,

1752
01:50:28,511 --> 01:50:32,950
probably came to him in that state
and it was used to study that a thing.

1753
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:37,550
That's how the Shama and say, you know,
like, uh, the plants told us, you know,

1754
01:50:37,570 --> 01:50:38,740
it was like the,
uh,

1755
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:44,160
he was one of the first really a
scientist to do deep studies with Lsd.

1756
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:49,060
I find that fascinating and I find
that so hard to believe. Uh, I don't,

1757
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:54,360
I also find it amazing how few scientists
today openly discussed psychedelic

1758
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:58,300
experiences and are enthusiastic. They'll
be ostracized. Isn't that amazing?

1759
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:03,320
It's sad. The same reason
that more artists don't talk
about it either. It's, uh,

1760
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,530
it's, they're not mutually
exclusive. You know,

1761
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:08,230
that people have to understand
that silly behavior, yes.

1762
01:51:08,231 --> 01:51:12,820
Can Be attributed to the recreational
drugs or recreational drug use at a one

1763
01:51:12,821 --> 01:51:14,680
that's not what we're talking about.
And B,

1764
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:19,000
just because someone is involved in
something that other people were using

1765
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:22,300
recreational doesn't mean there's not
some massive benefit to it that can be

1766
01:51:22,301 --> 01:51:26,770
discussed by scientists on, uh,
you know, a really scholarly level.

1767
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:31,860
There's something going on that can
truly benefit humanity by harnessing a

1768
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:38,100
substance that most certainly help
people access their expanded states of

1769
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:43,150
awareness. Now that is what Dr. Hoffman
wanted. And I quote him at length,

1770
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:46,600
uh,
on his hundred and first birthday,

1771
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:51,720
he wrote the most remarkable thing
about the promise of the entheogenic

1772
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:56,110
sacraments and about how he hoped,

1773
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:01,270
because he always felt tremendously
guilty for anyone who had, uh,

1774
01:52:01,450 --> 01:52:06,400
you know, uh, taken a wrong turn
or not been a, you know, headed,

1775
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:10,620
it had catalyze there
a predisposition to a,

1776
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:15,490
to a psychotic state. Borderline
personality should avoid it entirely.

1777
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:20,050
People who have a history of mental
illness, you know, without, uh,

1778
01:52:20,110 --> 01:52:23,890
professional, uh, use, they should
avoid these things for sure.

1779
01:52:24,070 --> 01:52:28,920
But sometimes people take them. And so
it, it haunted him horribly. And he, he,

1780
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:33,610
he was never an advocate, but he,
at the end of his life, really,

1781
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:37,540
you know, he kind of
told people about it. He,

1782
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:41,830
he on stage would say that, you know, I,

1783
01:52:41,870 --> 01:52:45,980
I sent the size did in
1938, uh, we tested it

1784
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,840
on animals. Nothing happened, you
know, and then five years later,

1785
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,940
you know, in, uh, April, he,

1786
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:59,020
he starts to hear a voice that asks
him to resynthesize this particular

1787
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:04,010
molecule. Now he sent the sizes
thousands and thousands of molecules,

1788
01:53:04,190 --> 01:53:04,641
but he said,

1789
01:53:04,641 --> 01:53:09,641
never before had he heard that voice
calling him to do a particular thing.

1790
01:53:09,711 --> 01:53:14,030
So he did it. And, uh, then, uh,

1791
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,150
April 19th, when he finally, uh,

1792
01:53:17,300 --> 01:53:21,410
basically dosed himself in 1943,
um,

1793
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:26,420
at four 20, really? Yeah. Have Four,

1794
01:53:26,421 --> 01:53:30,770
19 at 4:20 PM pm, he, uh,

1795
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:34,970
in his journal, he writes a, that
was his, uh, that's when he took it.

1796
01:53:35,510 --> 01:53:40,430
And, uh, the origin of four 20, no,
no, it's not. It makes sense. No,

1797
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:44,690
it isn't. But it's an interesting
coincidence. Yeah. And, uh,

1798
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:46,140
so I mean,
it ha,

1799
01:53:46,190 --> 01:53:50,450
it may have had some
sequential elegance in his own,

1800
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:52,160
uh,
journal writing.

1801
01:53:52,161 --> 01:53:57,161
It wasn't randomly that he chose that
time to do it because it was an experiment

1802
01:53:58,011 --> 01:54:00,140
that he was wondering about.
But he,

1803
01:54:00,350 --> 01:54:04,970
but he brewed up the tiniest
amount that any, uh, you know,

1804
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
that is for sure not active by
any substance known to humanity.

1805
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:15,410
Uh, if you take 250
million, 70 gram, you know,

1806
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:19,880
nothing happens with anything that's,
that's like, uh, uh, what do they call it?

1807
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:23,000
Homeopathy, you know,
it's that kind of dosage.

1808
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:28,120
But little did he know that he had
stumbled upon the most potent psychoactive

1809
01:54:28,131 --> 01:54:32,240
substance of all times. You
know, it's, uh, you know,

1810
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:36,710
Co many times, uh, more potent
and powerful than any other,

1811
01:54:36,740 --> 01:54:41,180
a sacrament in those
tiny mouths. And so, um,

1812
01:54:41,330 --> 01:54:45,740
he was catapulted into a, uh, uh, a
kind of chaos. He thought he was dying,

1813
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:50,000
of course. So, you know, and, and he just
didn't want to die in the lab. We would,

1814
01:54:50,001 --> 01:54:52,880
you want it to just go
home, you know, to die.

1815
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:58,060
And so he was freaking out feeling for
sure he had poisoned himself and he and

1816
01:54:58,341 --> 01:55:00,860
his assistant rode their bicycles back.
And of course,

1817
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:04,580
that's why they call it bicycle
day, you know, uh, four 19.

1818
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:09,740
And uh, that he made it home and
then they called, it was April 19th,

1819
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:13,640
April 19th. It was 1943 at four 20. Yes.

1820
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,000
Yes. That there was, uh, uh, I,

1821
01:55:17,001 --> 01:55:21,110
I did a painting and it's in the net of
being book. You need to bet the lottery.

1822
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,700
We need to call, put some
numbers on. Well, you know
what happened that same day?

1823
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:28,640
Probably around the same time. Well, well,

1824
01:55:28,641 --> 01:55:33,641
there was a Warsaw ghetto uprising
that happened in the wake of the Nazis

1825
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,160
wanting to burn down the war.
So ghetto Warsaw ghetto,

1826
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:41,240
and it never happened before.
There was a spike in the novelty,

1827
01:55:41,630 --> 01:55:46,500
a curve that day that was off the charts.
And,

1828
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:50,940
uh, they, it, it led to a siege. It
never happened and never happened since.

1829
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:56,430
Whoa. What the fuck is up with that?
The number. Isn't that interesting?

1830
01:55:57,150 --> 01:56:01,350
Isn't that interesting? Do you do, does
that make sense? It's a synchronicity.

1831
01:56:01,351 --> 01:56:05,230
That's just a interesting, the, you
know, something I've been noticing a,

1832
01:56:05,250 --> 01:56:08,940
and I can't explain it at all,
but it's just one of those mystery things.

1833
01:56:08,941 --> 01:56:12,360
Like you were saying, like in your dream,
you see these various things, you know,

1834
01:56:12,361 --> 01:56:16,680
they're, they're saying something, they're
all, it's almost like God is a Punster,

1835
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:17,401
you know,

1836
01:56:17,401 --> 01:56:22,380
and putting visionable rebus says
us for this is a visual language,

1837
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:23,640
you know,
in front of us.

1838
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:28,910
Have you ever looked into all this
stuff that's going on right now in,

1839
01:56:29,381 --> 01:56:33,360
in physics where all these uh,
different scientists are proposing?

1840
01:56:33,361 --> 01:56:38,040
The idea that we're living inside of a
simulation and it's becoming more and

1841
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:40,410
more prominent today.
I got a new thing,

1842
01:56:40,411 --> 01:56:45,390
technology review.com a new thing
published by Mit and this was a sent to me

1843
01:56:45,391 --> 01:56:48,990
through Twitter. So of course I
had to investigate it because I,

1844
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:50,670
I'm inundated by this shit.
Like,

1845
01:56:50,671 --> 01:56:55,671
literally every day there's some new study
or new proposal about the world being

1846
01:56:57,691 --> 01:57:01,110
some sort of the universe, the reality
being some sort of a simulation.

1847
01:57:01,230 --> 01:57:06,030
When you see shit like the number four
20 coming up over and over again for 19

1848
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:09,750
and four 20. Do you
ever stop and go, well,

1849
01:57:09,751 --> 01:57:12,450
maybe that's just the way it was written.
It's the cosmic code.

1850
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:14,970
It's the cosmic wink,
you know,

1851
01:57:15,330 --> 01:57:19,920
there are so many correspondences.
Uh, I feel like the, uh,

1852
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:25,470
what did, what happened to psychedelic
culture after that time, uh,

1853
01:57:26,260 --> 01:57:30,810
you know, was, uh, there, there came
a time of tremendous repression,

1854
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:34,500
but first there was scientific study.

1855
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:39,980
So they actually established the true
merits of these substances prior to them

1856
01:57:40,741 --> 01:57:45,360
becoming illegal,
illegal for political reasons,

1857
01:57:45,361 --> 01:57:49,920
by the way, you know? Hmm. Uh, not,

1858
01:57:49,921 --> 01:57:51,210
not for,
not and it,

1859
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:56,240
and I think it's anti American because
America is all about freedom of religion

1860
01:57:57,690 --> 01:58:02,070
and freedom of point of view. And
as Terence Mckenna says, you know,

1861
01:58:02,071 --> 01:58:03,500
there's nothing ever been a key.

1862
01:58:03,550 --> 01:58:07,770
I deuced against them except that
they give people funny ideas. Yeah.

1863
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:10,140
Well,
your definition of America,

1864
01:58:10,170 --> 01:58:15,000
much like a definition of God is not the
popular one as far as the rest of the

1865
01:58:15,001 --> 01:58:17,010
world.
And I think [inaudible] represents,

1866
01:58:17,011 --> 01:58:19,590
I think of it I'll get with Terry Monster.

1867
01:58:19,660 --> 01:58:22,960
Exactly. It's Americorp's,
that's what I call it.

1868
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:27,060
AMERICORP's is that what
America has become, right?

1869
01:58:27,370 --> 01:58:32,370
It's a living death that being perpetrated
on the world and it's because of of

1870
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:36,940
this, uh, uh, you know,
cause out, you know,

1871
01:58:36,941 --> 01:58:40,720
of this hole to the
military industrial complex.

1872
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:45,010
Eisenhower warned us about
it. She was going to say that.
Yeah. And so, so, you know,

1873
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:49,990
there are various reformers in
government that are trying, you know,

1874
01:58:49,991 --> 01:58:54,680
really trying to shift things, but
they're massive forces, you know,

1875
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:57,910
they are cons as the gnostics would say,
you know,

1876
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:01,960
that are kind of dragging their
heels in the evolutionary bell curve.

1877
01:59:01,961 --> 01:59:06,520
They haven't gotten the message that
we're all a unity and that we need to now

1878
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:10,180
think about how we can
best preserve the life web,

1879
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:15,220
not how we can destroy it and make profits
for a few years while we watched the

1880
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:17,200
weather, uh, go haywire.

1881
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:22,270
There's never before been
a clear indication that the
people who are in charge

1882
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:27,350
are not, they're not tuned into
the Internet. The they, they,

1883
01:59:27,351 --> 01:59:29,810
they came about this way.

1884
01:59:29,811 --> 01:59:34,340
They created this way long before there
was an internet and this is how it's

1885
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:38,180
always been done. And now that
it's being exposed all around them,

1886
01:59:38,181 --> 01:59:42,830
they're still clinging to this archaic
notion of non connection, right?

1887
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:45,320
This archaic notion that
all of your actions,

1888
01:59:45,321 --> 01:59:48,830
all of your deeds and all of our thoughts
and feelings aren't all connected in

1889
01:59:48,831 --> 01:59:52,670
some sort of a strange way that
we need to recognize a dress end.

1890
01:59:53,090 --> 01:59:56,060
We need to move forward with that as,

1891
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:59,690
as an ideal that we are
all connected then. Yes,

1892
01:59:59,870 --> 02:00:04,490
absolutely not happening. Cover it and we
have to recover it. It's a spoil banks.

1893
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:08,990
It's not happening with the
Federal Reserve or whoever
the fuck is in charge of

1894
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:13,580
sending us to Afghanistan. Right. Whoever
wants to us to actually put, you know,

1895
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:18,480
yeah. Well that was a, that was an
obvious and huge mistake. There's even a,

1896
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:23,030
uh, a page in there called remembering
nine 11 before it happened.

1897
02:00:23,690 --> 02:00:28,290
You know, now I think that
it's pretty remarkable, uh,

1898
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:32,420
kind of thing that, that, uh,
happened era of course, who,

1899
02:00:32,421 --> 02:00:37,400
but a spook would do something
like that. Nine 11. That's a joke.

1900
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,220
Okay. Emergency, you know,

1901
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:43,550
that's a spook that to Joe mean like the,

1902
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:48,760
like the nine 11 is the code word for
emergency right now outside of America.

1903
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:54,920
Question Mark.
You know,

1904
02:00:55,160 --> 02:01:00,160
like that's a reference
that only an American would,

1905
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:03,620
uh, would play with because, uh, okay.

1906
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:08,480
So then we have all the explosive
evidence about what happened that day.

1907
02:01:08,930 --> 02:01:13,400
Now, uh, you know, the burning of
the right stock and all of that.

1908
02:01:13,490 --> 02:01:18,290
Have we forgotten history? You know,
that's a massive distraction to, uh,

1909
02:01:18,830 --> 02:01:20,030
you know,
uh,

1910
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:25,090
stop the everybody from paying attention
to Enron and go into some place that

1911
02:01:26,241 --> 02:01:30,560
never attacked us. That's, this
is your point. The Iraq war,

1912
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,450
what was that based on?

1913
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:37,630
But a lot of lies and
Afghanistan the same way that,

1914
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:38,600
uh,

1915
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:43,600
there a need to sell weaponry
and to spend money on these,

1916
02:01:43,910 --> 02:01:45,770
uh, you know, uh,

1917
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:51,650
these mercenaries in order to,
uh, satisfy a certain hunger.

1918
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:57,190
And this a hunger is the shadow is the
set seti and energy that dwells in the

1919
02:01:59,691 --> 02:02:01,850
desert and is,
uh,

1920
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:06,880
and we are living off of what we
need to become is a solar powered,

1921
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:09,170
uh,
humanity.

1922
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:14,350
We are still struggling with set and
Horace who fought an epic battle thousands

1923
02:02:16,490 --> 02:02:20,270
of years ago in the deserts of
Egypt and continue it today.

1924
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:25,460
The soul of humanity has to go
toward the light and find new energy,

1925
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,600
uh, means to, uh,

1926
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:33,000
to bring us out of our
dependence, our addictions to, uh,

1927
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,360
the destructive web of, uh, this, uh,

1928
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,110
kind of oil Gorky that we're enmeshed in.

1929
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:42,030
So it's your opinion that,
uh,

1930
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:46,160
September levels with some sort of a
false flag event and it wasn't just

1931
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:48,010
incompetence or,
uh,

1932
02:02:48,011 --> 02:02:53,011
an attack that was capitalized on by
people with nefarious ideas that it was

1933
02:02:53,151 --> 02:02:57,620
instead plant. Um, or you would
only, I would don't, yeah,

1934
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:59,900
I entertain that possibility.

1935
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:02,630
And I think that the entire
affair needs to be examined.

1936
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:07,660
But why I was setting that
up and to controversial
elements that many scientists

1937
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:13,830
bring up. Not, you know, like
artists, you know, our people's,

1938
02:03:13,831 --> 02:03:15,740
an engineer has all those,

1939
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:19,940
all those people who analyze the actual
material and the polling of building

1940
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:24,800
seven as the smoking gun. But, you know,
you can go down that and look at it.

1941
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:27,620
I think it should be
examined. But the, uh,

1942
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:32,680
what I find fascinating about the entire
thing is the nest of synchronicities

1943
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:37,840
that, uh, artists, uh, where,

1944
02:03:38,090 --> 02:03:41,350
uh, exhibiting on, uh,

1945
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:46,130
that day, uh, there was, uh,

1946
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,770
a man who had a studio,

1947
02:03:48,980 --> 02:03:53,120
an artist who had a studio in a tower.
One,

1948
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:58,430
a number of artists had studios
actually in the twin towers. And,

1949
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:02,330
um, his name was Michael
Richards, actually.

1950
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:06,740
He was a black artist and he
was a sculptor and remarkable,

1951
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:11,540
wonderful work. You hate himself?
Well, he was, uh, he, he was, uh,

1952
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,990
he was an awesome, uh, that
was a bad joke. Yeah. Yeah.

1953
02:04:15,230 --> 02:04:18,880
Now he's has no relationship
to that, uh, uh,

1954
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:23,210
fella and just happened to
have the same name. And, uh,

1955
02:04:24,110 --> 02:04:25,800
so,
uh,

1956
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:29,910
his entire body of work was
destroyed practically, uh,

1957
02:04:30,050 --> 02:04:34,850
when the plane hit the twin towers.
And,

1958
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:38,970
um, so a couple months later, uh,

1959
02:04:39,120 --> 02:04:40,690
some of his friends discover,

1960
02:04:40,691 --> 02:04:45,300
and this a museum in South Carolina that
they have one of his pieces once been

1961
02:04:45,301 --> 02:04:49,500
discovered. And, uh,
it was a self portrait,

1962
02:04:50,160 --> 02:04:54,660
um, and, uh, at Saint Sebastian,

1963
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:59,940
you know, but instead of arrows going
through the body, they were airplanes.

1964
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:05,070
Wow. Okay. Whoa,

1965
02:05:05,970 --> 02:05:06,803
whoa.

1966
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:11,040
Saint Sebastian and the tar
baby is what it's called.

1967
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:12,870
Wow.

1968
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:14,520
Okay.

1969
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:17,130
Now that is a fact.

1970
02:05:19,210 --> 02:05:23,950
Now, uh, I did a painting
like an eight, 1989.

1971
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,910
I was,

1972
02:05:24,910 --> 02:05:29,050
it was a vision I had the day our daughter
was born and it became the painting

1973
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:33,010
Gaya. Now, what's interesting, you
can look in that book, Netapp being,

1974
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:38,070
we were in the World Trade
Center September 10th, 2001.

1975
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:44,110
Wow. And, uh, I, I put my
tag in there actually. And,

1976
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:48,690
uh, in the guy a painting,
there happened to be, um,

1977
02:05:48,940 --> 02:05:52,510
two airplanes. And, uh, there, uh,

1978
02:05:52,570 --> 02:05:54,070
there's also the twin towers.

1979
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,030
There's someone who looks
strangely like George Bush.

1980
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:02,140
He's embracing a terrorist and a disease.
Dick.

1981
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:08,470
And, uh, I had no idea it
was used in the Beastie boys.

1982
02:06:08,471 --> 02:06:13,420
It'll communication album,
which by the way, has, uh, uh,

1983
02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:19,150
I, I can't stand it. Uh, the, the
most famous hit from that, uh,

1984
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:22,720
from that album was a sabotage.

1985
02:06:23,890 --> 02:06:27,760
I tell you it now y'all, it was
sabotage, right? And, you know,

1986
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:32,940
and so there are numerous things planted
into the collective consciousness you

1987
02:06:34,541 --> 02:06:37,150
could say. But then the, the, uh,

1988
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:41,980
the comic book of Superman that
came out September 12th, actually,

1989
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:47,320
uh, had the twin towers surrounded in
smoke and how copters were around it.

1990
02:06:47,321 --> 02:06:50,670
And the first panel panel one,
there was a hip hop group.

1991
02:06:50,690 --> 02:06:55,320
Everybody remembers this thing was
released that week after nine 11, uh,

1992
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:58,620
there was this hip hop
group, the Coo who, uh,

1993
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:03,660
had two members there and they were with
kind of like punchers and in back of

1994
02:07:03,821 --> 02:07:08,440
them,
the twin towers exploding now,

1995
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:12,070
uh, they were prevented from releasing
it because it was September 12th.

1996
02:07:12,071 --> 02:07:15,010
They said, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,
whoa. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1997
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:18,370
But September 11th in Boston,

1998
02:07:18,371 --> 02:07:23,290
where's it's released live from
New York, this, uh, particular, um,

1999
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,500
place, uh, this band in Boston, uh,

2000
02:07:26,501 --> 02:07:28,760
and it had the twin towers
surrounded in flame.

2001
02:07:30,070 --> 02:07:34,930
So you think that this, these people
who are creating this art that are,

2002
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:40,130
are remembering these images that they're
pulling this from some collective from

2003
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:45,160
the [inaudible], I mean,
uh, close encounters, right?

2004
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:49,220
Remember that moment when they all
go into the artists, uh, you know,

2005
02:07:49,230 --> 02:07:53,350
room where there, oh, this one drew it
and that one sculpted it. And that one,

2006
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:57,740
you know,
they all got blazed with something and,

2007
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:01,020
and it, it, and it's such
a fascinating narrative,

2008
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:03,520
synchronicities that I
believe it's unprecedented.

2009
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:05,360
Well, you, you're,

2010
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:09,300
your point of view on just reality itself
has got to be so much different than

2011
02:08:09,301 --> 02:08:13,380
the average person's. How often
do you bring up this? I mean,

2012
02:08:13,381 --> 02:08:17,420
this is a very controversial and strange
thing to say. You know what I mean?

2013
02:08:17,421 --> 02:08:18,254
It's a very

2014
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:22,530
requirements saying that
it, that you know, uh,

2015
02:08:22,850 --> 02:08:25,770
that my painting or various other things,
uh,

2016
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:28,130
necessarily lead to the truth,

2017
02:08:28,430 --> 02:08:32,480
but they point towards something
strange. Very strange. I mean,

2018
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:37,200
anybody body examining the evidence,
it wasn't premeditated. It,

2019
02:08:37,250 --> 02:08:41,690
it's remembering nine 11
before it happened. Right.

2020
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:44,770
What w what I was saying was this is a,

2021
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:48,790
you just the way you have
to sort of lay this out.

2022
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:51,680
How many times have you
had this conversation with
someone that you could see

2023
02:08:51,681 --> 02:08:52,514
him go,

2024
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:57,290
oh, okay. Yeah. Looking at the time,

2025
02:08:57,790 --> 02:09:00,610
show the evidence though.
Show Michael Richard Sculpture,

2026
02:09:00,611 --> 02:09:05,200
which we do in this book. Matt
have been and show, show the,

2027
02:09:05,201 --> 02:09:08,170
um, uh, the folks that, um,

2028
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:12,910
DC weren't, weren't fond of it,
so I didn't reproduce their thing,

2029
02:09:12,911 --> 02:09:15,010
but people can go onto
the internet and find it.

2030
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:18,010
There's many Niecy what
does that DC comics,

2031
02:09:18,011 --> 02:09:21,370
they didn't want the superman panel
reproduced in a thing like that.

2032
02:09:21,700 --> 02:09:25,780
But you can talk about it and you
can say exactly what happened.

2033
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:29,290
And just to pointing it out,
you have a sense of the uncanny.

2034
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:33,960
There's a que se uh, and uh, uh,

2035
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:38,530
right. They couldn't release that thing
would, that's the real image. Yeah.

2036
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:41,500
That's it. No, that's not the real image.

2037
02:09:41,501 --> 02:09:45,160
That was what they fabricated
and wire to release that week.

2038
02:09:46,300 --> 02:09:50,620
But we're prevented by every good
sense, you know, to say good grief,

2039
02:09:50,621 --> 02:09:52,820
we cannot be doing it.
Doesn't mean,

2040
02:09:52,821 --> 02:09:56,340
is that the real image of nine 11
[inaudible] from there? Yeah. Yeah.

2041
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:58,810
That was the CD cover.
That was the angle. Yeah.

2042
02:09:58,930 --> 02:10:03,820
So I mean this is a smoking
gun of some kind of, of uh,

2043
02:10:03,850 --> 02:10:07,690
regulatory breakthrough.
That was a terrible thing.

2044
02:10:07,870 --> 02:10:09,520
It was a terrible thing but it,

2045
02:10:09,550 --> 02:10:12,460
but it leaked through the
consciousness of humanity.

2046
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:17,640
So you see the power of art as prophecy
and you see the power of art as what

2047
02:10:20,471 --> 02:10:24,820
could it point us toward?
We want to see a sacred possibility.

2048
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:29,350
We went to look at our highest potential,
not look at the destructive.

2049
02:10:29,351 --> 02:10:33,920
We want to take that power of art and
plant seeds of liberation in the minds of,

2050
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,641
of people,

2051
02:10:34,641 --> 02:10:39,641
not this kind of negative world of
self destructive nihilist a culture and

2052
02:10:40,341 --> 02:10:41,174
behavior.

2053
02:10:42,980 --> 02:10:45,890
My point of view or what I
was trying to get at was, um,

2054
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:50,700
when you go into this sort
of a definition of things,

2055
02:10:50,701 --> 02:10:53,810
it's a fairy fantastical
and amazing sort of a,

2056
02:10:54,060 --> 02:10:58,560
a concept that there is some sort of
frequency that we're tuning into and were

2057
02:10:58,561 --> 02:11:01,020
getting warnings from, from, you know,

2058
02:11:01,110 --> 02:11:03,990
future events that we'll
have a big ripple in time.

2059
02:11:04,140 --> 02:11:06,630
How has this normally received
when you talk to people,

2060
02:11:06,631 --> 02:11:08,340
I mean you're a very unusual guy.

2061
02:11:08,490 --> 02:11:10,500
How many people can you
talk to about this stuff?

2062
02:11:12,200 --> 02:11:17,160
I think it's unsettling to
most people because, uh,

2063
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:20,480
it's,
I haven't heard it spoken up,

2064
02:11:20,481 --> 02:11:25,100
but I hate just happened to be one of
the people that got blazed with a vision.

2065
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:29,780
I had forgotten about it entirely. I,
you know, I knew I had painted some, oh,

2066
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:33,650
this was the dark possibility of
humanity and this is the light.

2067
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:36,530
This is the nature, you know,
and this is what we have to in,

2068
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:41,400
here's Al Gore with some basket of
fruits and things in the guy, guy, guy.

2069
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:43,700
Can you pull it up?
The guy at painting.

2070
02:11:43,820 --> 02:11:46,190
And how long did you do
this before September?

2071
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:49,760
It was a 1989.
It was,

2072
02:11:50,060 --> 02:11:54,650
I had the vision in 1988 the day our
daughter was born. You know, how powerful,

2073
02:11:54,730 --> 02:11:58,010
you know, your child being
born is, it impacts you.

2074
02:11:58,011 --> 02:12:01,640
So as we had been up for
three days anyway, and, uh,

2075
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,860
and I had to leave my wife,

2076
02:12:03,861 --> 02:12:07,730
they kind of kicked me out and I had
to go do an illustration project,

2077
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:11,870
but as I was going over the
Brooklyn Bridge, I had this
vision, you know, and this,

2078
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:15,820
it was probably the division, you know,
I've Manhattan and the vocoder sound that,

2079
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:19,200
you know, but, but I had
this, uh, this dip titch uh,

2080
02:12:19,250 --> 02:12:24,140
kind of think there's a better
one on Alex grey.com. But the, uh,

2081
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:26,030
but that's basically it. The, uh,

2082
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:30,890
the world tree as the great mother
and the stress, uh, that humanity,

2083
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:35,540
uh, is, uh, causing food. The twin towers
and little planes. That's fucking trippy.

2084
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:39,620
Yeah. So 1989. And, uh, uh, there was,

2085
02:12:39,710 --> 02:12:42,770
somebody bought it and, and
of course it was in the, uh,

2086
02:12:42,860 --> 02:12:45,830
the El communication album. And, and, uh,

2087
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:49,820
and then I published it in 1990
and the Sacred Mirror book,

2088
02:12:49,821 --> 02:12:54,320
my first book that came out then. And
so that was in there. And, and, uh,

2089
02:12:55,250 --> 02:12:57,890
um, uh, after nine 11,

2090
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:02,920
some people sent me emails and
showed me the picture again and I,

2091
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:08,550
I hadn't remembered any of that at all.
That's amazing.

2092
02:13:11,130 --> 02:13:12,830
That's really,
really freaky.

2093
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:17,060
When you think about these
ideas and these blips in these,

2094
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:21,110
these signals and whatever it is that
you tune into when you become creative,

2095
02:13:21,410 --> 02:13:23,320
you know, when, when you think about the,

2096
02:13:23,321 --> 02:13:26,840
the impact that the work that
comes out of it has on people,

2097
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:31,560
what do you think ultimately we're
doing here as humans are evolving?

2098
02:13:31,561 --> 02:13:32,490
Aren't cognitive

2099
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:34,110
process.
Absolutely.

2100
02:13:34,111 --> 02:13:38,100
You can't help but be transformative as
technology and destruction of anything

2101
02:13:38,101 --> 02:13:41,990
to do with that. Is there cars?
It's accelerating the, uh, you know,

2102
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,970
the shaft or change to the
need for change and to grow.

2103
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:48,960
It's almost like we're threatening suicide
unless we can think about. Absolutely.

2104
02:13:48,961 --> 02:13:50,700
And you should together,
I'm gonna blow my brains out.

2105
02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:56,290
The Waking Up is happening a lot through
the interconnectedness of the web of

2106
02:13:58,130 --> 02:14:02,810
technology. Technology had to
happen after an industrial period.

2107
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:08,080
All of it has been an
evolving intelligence that
is finally beginning to see

2108
02:14:08,511 --> 02:14:12,830
it's cosmic origins in this story of,
uh,

2109
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,250
of the universe that we've
been discovering and, uh,

2110
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:20,480
and the Hubble telescope that shows
us the vast ness of space in the

2111
02:14:20,481 --> 02:14:23,840
understanding of dark energy
now that connects everything,

2112
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:26,930
the clusters of galaxies
that had to exist,

2113
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:32,240
that the earth is a rare, uh, kind of,

2114
02:14:32,270 --> 02:14:36,710
I think of it as the, uh, as this, um,

2115
02:14:36,950 --> 02:14:41,090
owl chemical, um, balancing act.

2116
02:14:41,390 --> 02:14:45,740
Well, it's, it's, it's, it's, you know,

2117
02:14:45,741 --> 02:14:49,640
the Olympic that goes around the sort of,
um,

2118
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:54,140
whatever the alchemists puts
into his retort or into his,

2119
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:58,430
into his flask. This flask, uh,

2120
02:14:58,580 --> 02:15:03,580
then is heated and it has a special
temperature that brings the interior to

2121
02:15:05,511 --> 02:15:09,410
transformation. And it goes
through a lot of different stages.

2122
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:14,800
But I think of the earth and its
sir surrounding geomagnetic field.

2123
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:20,180
The geomagnetic field is our limbic.
It's our al chemical epic.

2124
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:25,690
Now you'll look at the Mars and it no
longer has a magnetic field around it.

2125
02:15:27,290 --> 02:15:28,790
And so everything has died.

2126
02:15:29,300 --> 02:15:33,860
And so this magnetic field that surrounds
the earth is our protection from the

2127
02:15:33,861 --> 02:15:38,240
solar, uh, flares and
the solar heat, the sun.

2128
02:15:38,241 --> 02:15:41,780
And it gives that beautiful kind
of a Rara, uh, that happens.

2129
02:15:42,050 --> 02:15:46,360
And so just at this
particular, uh, orbit, uh,

2130
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:49,850
where are we in relationship
with our guru, the sun?

2131
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:53,780
And we have this attraction, you
know, but what is attraction?

2132
02:15:53,781 --> 02:15:58,340
It's the bending of space time and
you're at a particular circulation,

2133
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:02,870
but that circulation has the Olympic
of the geomagnetic field around it.

2134
02:16:03,100 --> 02:16:03,933
The US,

2135
02:16:04,010 --> 02:16:09,010
what the experiment of life can unfold
takes billions and billions of years to

2136
02:16:11,091 --> 02:16:15,860
grow an intelligence that can
start to recognize its own source.

2137
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:17,930
That's astonishing.

2138
02:16:18,530 --> 02:16:23,530
That's a great epic journey of the
evolution of human consciousness.

2139
02:16:24,051 --> 02:16:28,730
And that's what's really going on.
Don't read the Times.

2140
02:16:28,731 --> 02:16:33,190
Read Aternity is, as Emerson said,
you know, it's a great quote.

2141
02:16:33,730 --> 02:16:38,320
Do you ever see [inaudible] uh, album
cover live scenes from New York City?

2142
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:43,360
Cha Cha, there it is. Yeah, it's,
there it is released nine 11.

2143
02:16:43,900 --> 02:16:48,580
Yeah. And has the twin towers on
fire on an apple. That's crazy.

2144
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,730
The, um, the future.

2145
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:56,050
How do you, uh, how do you think
this is all gonna play out? I mean,

2146
02:16:56,051 --> 02:17:01,051
obviously you believe that you expressing
yourself with love and using art and

2147
02:17:02,021 --> 02:17:06,520
finding creativity elevates the human
experience as do I think there's something

2148
02:17:06,700 --> 02:17:10,540
incredible about seeing great art in
any form, whether it's great music,

2149
02:17:11,230 --> 02:17:13,420
great paintings or whatever it is.

2150
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:18,421
There's something about seeing someone
really tap into whatever it is that is

2151
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:22,330
going on. When you're being creative,
whatever it is that you're really,

2152
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:26,360
when you're really accessing the
imagination that elevates us. It does.

2153
02:17:26,680 --> 02:17:29,740
You see that as an integral
part of this experience,

2154
02:17:29,741 --> 02:17:32,770
of this transformative experience
that human beings are going through.

2155
02:17:32,771 --> 02:17:34,630
But where do you see it
going? Like, what do you,

2156
02:17:34,810 --> 02:17:36,720
what do you see wakening
to our own? Yeah, I'm

2157
02:17:36,720 --> 02:17:37,650
creative spirit,

2158
02:17:37,651 --> 02:17:42,651
our own unique lens into the infinite
one that we all are and reflection stuff.

2159
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:48,600
Uh, we're, uh, you know,

2160
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:52,500
ultimately humanity has a great future.

2161
02:17:52,501 --> 02:17:57,240
And if you look at the evolutionary
bell curve of what's possible for human

2162
02:17:57,241 --> 02:18:01,360
consciousness and love,
uh Huh.

2163
02:18:02,010 --> 02:18:07,010
And how primitive it still seems that
humanity is in terms of their ability to

2164
02:18:07,771 --> 02:18:09,720
love one another.
You know,

2165
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:14,130
we've had great teachers from
all over the world, you know,

2166
02:18:14,131 --> 02:18:16,350
teach us the same thing.

2167
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:20,940
The wisdom masters say repeatedly
to love each other, you know,

2168
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:23,340
and uh,
not to kill each other.

2169
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:28,560
And it's something that is so
simple and so true and so beautiful.

2170
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,240
And,
uh,

2171
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:35,310
this is the affirmation of the
intelligence that built ourselves.

2172
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:39,340
We have to tap into the, you know, we,

2173
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:43,210
we recently had the
guest, Paul Stamets, uh,

2174
02:18:43,380 --> 02:18:47,100
visit cause him a couple of weeks
ago at our fourth summer. Him,

2175
02:18:47,101 --> 02:18:51,210
what you're referring to is the chapel of
sacred mirrors in New York. Absolutely.

2176
02:18:51,510 --> 02:18:54,860
At the chapel of sacred
mayors in Wappinger. Uh,

2177
02:18:54,930 --> 02:18:59,930
actually we had the great Miko Eco or
Eco Miko cow mycologist ECO mycologist,

2178
02:19:03,451 --> 02:19:06,660
Paul Stamets, who's written
extensively about, uh,

2179
02:19:06,750 --> 02:19:09,110
the power of fungus and the,
uh,

2180
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:13,470
he's one of the world's
experts in medicinal. And, um,

2181
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:18,780
uh, just the, uh, the
power of these things too.

2182
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:23,270
Like he uses them to soak
up oil spills, the, uh,

2183
02:19:23,460 --> 02:19:28,200
oyster mushrooms and things like that
have been used to draw hydrocarbons,

2184
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:32,090
uh, out of, uh, uh, water
that's been polluted with them.

2185
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:36,440
And Chernobyl.
And the 30 mile radius around Chernobyl,

2186
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:41,090
there are funguses growing
mushrooms growing that are hot.

2187
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:43,010
They're radiation,
uh,

2188
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:48,070
filled because the mycelium that they
fruit from has been drawing all of the

2189
02:19:49,730 --> 02:19:54,730
radiation from the soil in order for
life to come back to the forest there,

2190
02:19:57,351 --> 02:20:02,351
the deepest oldest plant on earth and
human beings themselves diverged from the

2191
02:20:03,591 --> 02:20:06,680
fungus over 650 million years ago.

2192
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:11,570
So we have this connection,
this web of connectedness and obviously,

2193
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:16,790
uh, uh, a connection with the
intelligence of the mushroom and, uh,

2194
02:20:17,210 --> 02:20:21,380
and Paul at far from
being a Terrence, uh, um,

2195
02:20:21,680 --> 02:20:25,850
sort of endorsing of
the, uh, uh, you know,

2196
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:28,750
exogenous kind of, uh, um,

2197
02:20:28,970 --> 02:20:31,280
fertilization of the earth with the spore.

2198
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:35,780
He believes it was homegrown and
he believes that we're exporting.

2199
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:36,830
Uh,

2200
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:41,830
so I love that kind of can do earth
based consciousness that evolved in this

2201
02:20:43,161 --> 02:20:44,610
alembic.
And for those who

2202
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:48,230
don't understand what you meant by
that, what would you, you met for the,

2203
02:20:48,231 --> 02:20:53,120
the story is a Mckenna believes that it's
possible that mushrooms came from the

2204
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:56,570
vacuum of space.
It rise on asteroids as well.

2205
02:20:56,571 --> 02:20:58,550
It's the theory of Panspermia,

2206
02:20:58,820 --> 02:21:02,270
which is we know amino acids and certain
things are transferred and there are

2207
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:05,220
asteroids here from other planets
that have land the media rights.

2208
02:21:05,810 --> 02:21:08,840
And that is also one of the theories about
what happened to Mars as well. Right?

2209
02:21:08,841 --> 02:21:11,450
And that's how they lost
their environment. It was
an asteroid will impact

2210
02:21:11,550 --> 02:21:16,370
possible. And certainly we,
uh, the human, uh, or the,

2211
02:21:16,440 --> 02:21:20,740
the great chain of being in great
chain of evolution that, uh,

2212
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:26,180
was impacted on the earth. Certainly,
uh, there's a belief that they media,

2213
02:21:26,190 --> 02:21:27,730
right. Uh, you know,

2214
02:21:27,810 --> 02:21:32,810
basically ended the era of the
dinosaurs and these little rat,

2215
02:21:33,091 --> 02:21:37,140
like things that were our
ancestors were able to, uh,

2216
02:21:37,170 --> 02:21:42,170
become more dominant as a species and
evolve due to the territorial kind of

2217
02:21:42,511 --> 02:21:46,410
disputes being over with these
large lizard people. Yeah,

2218
02:21:46,411 --> 02:21:50,220
that really was a nice,
nice break for us really.

2219
02:21:50,430 --> 02:21:52,170
And it had to happen.
But yeah,

2220
02:21:52,171 --> 02:21:56,970
we have big brother Jupiter out there
watching our back and it's taking the

2221
02:21:56,971 --> 02:22:00,010
heat, you know, he's
the bouncer of the, uh,

2222
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:03,210
whole cosmos a or Arab
middle solar system.

2223
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:08,540
And so only at a certain
level surrounded by a living,

2224
02:22:09,481 --> 02:22:14,210
kind of a lambic and
shielded by a particulars,

2225
02:22:14,270 --> 02:22:19,270
a kind of a planetary brother was
life of this kind even possible.

2226
02:22:20,670 --> 02:22:24,840
Think of how many billions of
galaxies it might take. We,

2227
02:22:25,530 --> 02:22:29,910
well, we certainly are probably
the only, you know, Earth,

2228
02:22:29,911 --> 02:22:33,600
planetary consciousness in the
universe. Obviously, you know,

2229
02:22:33,601 --> 02:22:36,390
we're a unique little neighborhood.
When you say Earth,

2230
02:22:36,391 --> 02:22:39,000
planetary consciousness in the universe,
what do you mean by that? Well,

2231
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:44,250
there's no other earth right where
it, where the earth, this planet,

2232
02:22:44,580 --> 02:22:47,940
we're the only ones.
We're the only ones it evolves uniquely.

2233
02:22:47,941 --> 02:22:52,430
Darwin showed that on every
little, uh, uh, cov or,

2234
02:22:52,431 --> 02:22:55,140
or things,
things evolve a little bit differently.

2235
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:59,790
So wherever else life exists,
if it does,

2236
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:05,070
uh, uh, in a quite quite likely debt,
does it, most scientists would agree that,

2237
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:07,420
but, um, uh,

2238
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:10,980
is we have a unique jewel.

2239
02:23:11,310 --> 02:23:14,910
We've been gifted with it from
billions of years of evolution.

2240
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:19,320
Don't fucking below it. That's
the most important thing. Yeah.

2241
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:23,970
It's a w w we are saying if people don't
understand it is that Jupiter has a

2242
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:27,690
massive amount of gravity. It's enormous
and it absorbs asteroidal impacts,

2243
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:33,020
sucks them all up. It's like
the body guard for the earth.
It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

2244
02:23:33,090 --> 02:23:34,390
Yeah. It's, it's,

2245
02:23:34,391 --> 02:23:39,240
it's truly unique situation as far
as what we've studied in the cosmos.

2246
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:44,040
But I might be further evidence.
There's a simulation. I'm like, yeah,

2247
02:23:44,130 --> 02:23:48,720
which is awesome. Well, you know, my
experience, uh, with, with Alison,

2248
02:23:48,930 --> 02:23:52,870
just to inform that
one, uh, our first, um,

2249
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:56,810
kind of breakthrough,
um,

2250
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:00,630
psychedelic experience that
changed both of our works.

2251
02:24:00,631 --> 02:24:05,280
It happened about a year after we first
met him, like our first anniversary,

2252
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:09,420
June 3rd, say, uh, uh, 1976.

2253
02:24:09,930 --> 02:24:14,930
And we both melted down into these kind
of Tour Royito fountains and trains of

2254
02:24:16,931 --> 02:24:20,820
light and every other being
in thing in the universe,

2255
02:24:20,821 --> 02:24:25,680
which one of these balls of light as like
a soul. But it was, you know, like, uh,

2256
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:27,990
uh,
an amazing kind of tourists.

2257
02:24:28,020 --> 02:24:31,230
It was like a tornado flow and uh,

2258
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:33,780
this thing felt much more

2259
02:24:35,310 --> 02:24:39,570
alive and real than our kind
of material world reality.

2260
02:24:39,660 --> 02:24:42,360
It felt like this is what's
really going on. It's,

2261
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:47,420
it's eternally and infinitely
light and we are projecting our,

2262
02:24:48,720 --> 02:24:53,490
uh, kind of souls into
experiences to have, uh,

2263
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:54,450
um,

2264
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:59,450
in reaching educational opportunities
and try to wake up to God sent us here to

2265
02:25:00,571 --> 02:25:05,260
wake up to God, you know, to the
core of our being, to our God self.

2266
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:09,750
That's why this painting that's on the
cover of the net being is called God self

2267
02:25:10,350 --> 02:25:15,240
because it's a symbol of our
interconnectedness with all other gods.

2268
02:25:15,241 --> 02:25:17,550
Selves is every other being and thing.

2269
02:25:17,551 --> 02:25:22,551
And the network has access to this
great vast intelligence of the,

2270
02:25:23,650 --> 02:25:25,660
there's no other reason
that we could be here

2271
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:31,380
when you believe that and think
that and then see what's going on.

2272
02:25:31,381 --> 02:25:35,650
Like with everybody saber rattling
about going to war with Iran. Well,

2273
02:25:35,690 --> 02:25:36,840
what do you,
how does that mean?

2274
02:25:37,340 --> 02:25:39,510
I feel very sad, you know, because, uh,

2275
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:44,240
really it's about a breakout the piece,
Monkees,

2276
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:47,990
you know, don't destroy
each other and don't, uh,

2277
02:25:48,110 --> 02:25:52,160
don't poison the web that sustains you.

2278
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:58,240
That is only logical and by toxifying
both the consciousness of humanity by,

2279
02:26:03,710 --> 02:26:05,180
uh,
you know,

2280
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:10,840
in training people's minds with a limiting
self images instead of accessing our

2281
02:26:12,681 --> 02:26:16,580
unity as a human species
and expand beyond that.

2282
02:26:16,581 --> 02:26:19,850
If you can feel,
even though you may hate your neighbor,

2283
02:26:20,060 --> 02:26:22,310
you now you may have
a gripe here or there,

2284
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:26,180
but ultimately you
connected with loved ones.

2285
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:29,180
Love brought us all here.

2286
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:34,190
Love is the highest expression
of the cosmos. You know,

2287
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:39,280
Albert Hoffman said that
the highest refinement of
light in the universe is love

2288
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:48,040
because it took a solar battery
like our son to give birth to uh,

2289
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:50,540
uh,
a planet earth.

2290
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:54,740
And it took the evolutionary train
billions of years to get here to a point

2291
02:26:54,741 --> 02:26:56,330
where a consciousness,

2292
02:26:56,331 --> 02:27:00,500
a brain was capable of having
the experience of love,

2293
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:04,520
which was the common source of everyone,

2294
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:09,830
the love that brought us all here
to recognize it in each other,

2295
02:27:09,831 --> 02:27:14,060
to honor it and each other through all
different ways until we celebrate that

2296
02:27:14,450 --> 02:27:18,740
amazing experience and to try and,
you know, turn the ship around.

2297
02:27:18,740 --> 02:27:22,550
Now folks, you know,
don't go over the edge.

2298
02:27:22,610 --> 02:27:26,840
Don't commit suicide, do
something harder. You know?

2299
02:27:26,841 --> 02:27:30,950
Why is it more impossible
as the occupy folks said,

2300
02:27:31,130 --> 02:27:36,080
to imagine the end of capitalism then?
Or Why is it more,

2301
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:40,280
uh, easy to imagine the apocalypse
than the end of capitalism?

2302
02:27:41,330 --> 02:27:42,163
Yeah.

2303
02:27:42,290 --> 02:27:43,200
You think the,

2304
02:27:43,670 --> 02:27:47,780
that capitalism is the big problem and
it's not just putting hard of morals,

2305
02:27:47,810 --> 02:27:52,190
it's part of it. Yes. All of that. Because
it's not a god centered consciousness.

2306
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:54,230
We've wandered away,
you know,

2307
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:58,100
is it possible though to have a god
centered consciousness and produce all the

2308
02:27:58,101 --> 02:28:01,520
shit that we produced to make all the
laptops we make to make all the cars we

2309
02:28:01,521 --> 02:28:04,850
make? You know what Steven
Chops was and to my friend.

2310
02:28:06,690 --> 02:28:07,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2311
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:10,120
Who's in a yelling at his employees.
Yes.

2312
02:28:10,150 --> 02:28:12,710
She's ended up making Chinese
people worked for $50 a month.

2313
02:28:12,950 --> 02:28:14,810
He was into a lot of shit there was,

2314
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:18,800
but look at the nucleus of where those
things that you were just celebrating

2315
02:28:18,830 --> 02:28:22,520
came from. Well, he made
it his, it was from his LSD

2316
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:23,410
experiences.

2317
02:28:23,690 --> 02:28:28,460
He credited that with being
a tremendous opening for him,

2318
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:31,760
uh, and informing his, uh,

2319
02:28:31,761 --> 02:28:35,090
breakthroughs in
technology and Kary Mullis,

2320
02:28:35,091 --> 02:28:39,950
the Nobel Prize winning a molecular
biologist has said exactly the same thing.

2321
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:43,730
And many people's lives have
been ruined by these things,

2322
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:48,070
but many other people's lives
have been saved. My own, um, the,

2323
02:28:48,071 --> 02:28:52,670
the Francis Crick story, is that true?
You Go, yeah, this is a true, well,

2324
02:28:52,700 --> 02:28:57,250
you know, it, it is a
congested me. It is a, uh, uh,

2325
02:28:57,260 --> 02:28:59,780
it was released after his death,
right.

2326
02:28:59,781 --> 02:29:04,070
Cause he by threat of deaths had such,
and so now you could say,

2327
02:29:04,430 --> 02:29:05,060
oh,

2328
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:10,060
now somebody just trying to hijack
that breakthrough of the imagination.

2329
02:29:10,760 --> 02:29:15,760
But then you go back to when it happened
and you realize that actually he was a

2330
02:29:16,101 --> 02:29:20,540
psychedelic advocate and he had, um, uh,

2331
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:25,580
like many of his scientist
friends experimented with
these substances which were

2332
02:29:25,581 --> 02:29:28,430
supposed to catalyze the
creative imagination.

2333
02:29:28,670 --> 02:29:33,260
So he had read the papers and he
had access to these things. And, uh,

2334
02:29:33,261 --> 02:29:37,670
so, uh, he, there was no
stigma about it. In fact,

2335
02:29:37,671 --> 02:29:42,671
the first life magazine stuff about
psychedelics was extremely positive and

2336
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:46,130
there was no stigma about it than what,
and he'd come out and say it initially.

2337
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:51,200
Oh, because by the time,
uh, that it was a, yeah,

2338
02:29:51,201 --> 02:29:52,910
you would think you would think,

2339
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:58,090
but he might not want to
Sally his breakthrough by,

2340
02:29:59,430 --> 02:30:04,100
uh, by, by, by putting
anything between, uh,

2341
02:30:04,101 --> 02:30:08,630
the breakthrough insight and the, you
know, then what are you talking about?

2342
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:14,090
What, you know, based on a drug induced
hallucination. But, you know, I mean,

2343
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:19,010
that's how the benzene ring was
discovered. It was in a dream, you know,

2344
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:20,060
and,
uh,

2345
02:30:20,180 --> 02:30:24,140
so great discoveries come through
the visionary imagination.

2346
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:27,470
Isn't the Hell Day cargo the idea of
science in the first place? There you go.

2347
02:30:27,500 --> 02:30:29,050
It was a dream that,
uh,

2348
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:34,600
I think the exact quote was the science
and nature will be conquered by using

2349
02:30:34,971 --> 02:30:39,530
measurement. There you go. Well
that was a really important thing,

2350
02:30:39,531 --> 02:30:43,620
but conquered gives it, yeah, I
think I probably use that. That's,

2351
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:48,470
but that is an aggressive
stance that, that uh, the,

2352
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:53,570
um, the male species has,

2353
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:57,320
has, uh, promoted because
it's very self serving.

2354
02:30:57,800 --> 02:31:01,940
And I think that, uh, if, you know,

2355
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:03,320
part of,
uh,

2356
02:31:03,350 --> 02:31:07,610
what we're doing at this
point and as evolving, uh,

2357
02:31:07,611 --> 02:31:12,611
human beings is trying to create a new
model of possibility for humanity and in

2358
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:19,070
a realm of sometimes for some
people diminishing expectations.

2359
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:20,650
So the,
uh,

2360
02:31:20,670 --> 02:31:25,650
Paul Stamets a point of view of how
mushrooms can save the world and how

2361
02:31:25,651 --> 02:31:30,651
mycelium is actually a
network of intelligence that
connects us with the plant

2362
02:31:30,901 --> 02:31:35,580
realm and that we can take advantage
of by tapping into the nervous system.

2363
02:31:35,790 --> 02:31:40,790
That's a humanity diverged from
over 650 million years ago.

2364
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:44,430
Now that's tapping into
cosmic intelligence.

2365
02:31:44,790 --> 02:31:47,670
Do you follow Mckenna's stoned ape theory?

2366
02:31:47,840 --> 02:31:52,470
I feel like that's the way a lot of people
and even responsible anthropologists.

2367
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,370
Thank that.

2368
02:31:53,370 --> 02:31:57,630
There's some something to it because
they certainly would have encountered the

2369
02:31:57,631 --> 02:32:02,631
psilocybin mushrooms and who can say
that it didn't play a part and catalyzing

2370
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:07,710
the growth of human consciousness. Now
it was Leary's or I'm in Lilly. Oh,

2371
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:11,670
both leary and Lilly ideas was that it,
uh,

2372
02:32:11,671 --> 02:32:15,690
that these substances could advance in
the evolution of human consciousness.

2373
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:20,280
Now you look at the Uni Oda Veggie
Vegetal, which is the, uh, first,

2374
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:24,690
uh, psychedelic church for white
people, I guess in the United States.

2375
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:28,170
Um,
and part of the mission of the UDV,

2376
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,870
which is a church that
originated in Brazil, you know,

2377
02:32:30,890 --> 02:32:35,470
the heart of the Amazon from the
green mantle of the earth. Uh,

2378
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:39,450
the green emerald comes these great
wisdom traditions that are spreading

2379
02:32:39,451 --> 02:32:44,010
throughout the world with
Iowasca and people are waking
up to the mind of nature,

2380
02:32:44,460 --> 02:32:49,380
um, uh, through these plants, sacraments
that have been used for centuries,

2381
02:32:49,530 --> 02:32:52,810
for thousands of years actually.
And um,

2382
02:32:52,860 --> 02:32:57,090
more and more anthropologists are saying,
well, they were seeing visions and the,

2383
02:32:57,300 --> 02:32:58,770
and the place,

2384
02:32:58,771 --> 02:33:03,771
we know that the bog people used to
smoke cannabis and cannabis has been

2385
02:33:04,501 --> 02:33:09,490
humanities friend for a long time.
Now neuroscientists just to,

2386
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:11,670
and,
and I'll hand the floor over.

2387
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:16,970
A neuroscientist in quoted in scientific
American said most neuroscientists

2388
02:33:18,301 --> 02:33:23,301
would agree that everything
that we experience is a
figment of our imagination.

2389
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:30,060
Most neurosciences would agree with this.
That's what she said.

2390
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:32,670
She might be crazy.
She might be,

2391
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:37,790
but she had an entire issue of scientific
American optical illusions that it's a

2392
02:33:38,941 --> 02:33:41,730
yearly publication.
And so yeah,

2393
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:44,850
she argues for this idea of
the plasticity of the mind.

2394
02:33:45,240 --> 02:33:49,170
And when you take these a dimensional
shift, you know, I'm like,

2395
02:33:49,171 --> 02:33:52,770
you're changing the radio
station with your, um,

2396
02:33:52,890 --> 02:33:55,280
kind of dimensional shifting that some,
uh,

2397
02:33:55,440 --> 02:33:57,930
psychonauts are able to do your,

2398
02:33:58,010 --> 02:34:02,370
you're tapping into different wavelengths
so you literally change reality.

2399
02:34:02,430 --> 02:34:04,620
Absolutely.
Literally can change reality.

2400
02:34:04,621 --> 02:34:09,240
Reality is reality is low dimensional
reality is code dimensional.

2401
02:34:09,241 --> 02:34:12,200
It's not like you, you know, you are,

2402
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:15,090
this conversation changes
reality in this dimension,

2403
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:18,790
but they'd also has a resonance
with another dimension.

2404
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,370
So it's essentially what we
were talking about earlier.

2405
02:34:22,470 --> 02:34:26,900
That's neither real nor not real
and that, exactly. There you go.

2406
02:34:27,110 --> 02:34:30,680
It's a combination of
imagination and reality.

2407
02:34:31,190 --> 02:34:35,340
One of the things that always struck me
about imagination is how it's sort of a

2408
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:40,690
marginalized, like the idea
of all that. Timmy, he's got
a vivid imagination, right?

2409
02:34:40,691 --> 02:34:42,020
You know, there's,
there's something to that.

2410
02:34:42,021 --> 02:34:45,650
But the reality is that
every physical thing,

2411
02:34:45,710 --> 02:34:47,600
including this building that we're in,

2412
02:34:47,620 --> 02:34:49,670
including this chair
that you're sitting in,

2413
02:34:49,850 --> 02:34:51,830
the microphone that
you're talking through,

2414
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:56,540
all of it was created through the
imagination. So it did not exist.

2415
02:34:56,780 --> 02:35:00,980
It was thought up through
the imagination then became,

2416
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:03,020
it manifested itself in a physical form.

2417
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:08,360
And we've become basically numb to
the spectacle of the creation that has

2418
02:35:09,421 --> 02:35:10,740
unfolded before us.

2419
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:15,920
And if we could remove our blinders
and notice the awesomeness, you know,

2420
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:18,840
in the lean away from the Jibber Jabber,
you know,

2421
02:35:18,841 --> 02:35:23,841
we could be more at peace and maybe
recognized that the same beautiful,

2422
02:35:24,130 --> 02:35:29,070
uh, true and good stuff that flows through
your heart is flowing through mine.

2423
02:35:29,180 --> 02:35:30,740
Well,
if it is possible,

2424
02:35:30,741 --> 02:35:34,750
I believe that conversations
like this are what move, uh,

2425
02:35:34,920 --> 02:35:38,300
the consciousness of the people who
listen to this and the people who consider

2426
02:35:38,301 --> 02:35:40,470
these thoughts and the
things that you've said it,

2427
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:44,210
it does move things in a better direction
and moves it in the better direction

2428
02:35:44,211 --> 02:35:47,480
for those people that are listening.
And I think if there's any one way,

2429
02:35:47,481 --> 02:35:49,610
we really can't change this world,

2430
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:52,700
it's to change the way people
who are open minded view it.

2431
02:35:52,910 --> 02:35:54,740
If you're open and you,
you,

2432
02:35:54,770 --> 02:35:57,500
you introduce a positive new
idea into someone's mind,

2433
02:35:57,740 --> 02:36:00,710
you know that that can change them
and benefit them in a positive way.

2434
02:36:00,860 --> 02:36:03,210
So if you really want to change the world,
you already just did it.

2435
02:36:03,211 --> 02:36:04,340
You just did it with this conversation.

2436
02:36:05,980 --> 02:36:08,800
You're awesome. Chow and you're awesome
too, man. You, I love you too many. Your,

2437
02:36:08,801 --> 02:36:09,970
your work is amazing.

2438
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,930
And for folks who want to stay
up on everything you're doing,

2439
02:36:14,110 --> 02:36:18,440
they can follow you on Twitter.
It's Alex. Great. Kozum c o s m um,

2440
02:36:18,850 --> 02:36:23,830
gray. Why not a y? Um, and uh, if
they want to, what is your website?

2441
02:36:24,700 --> 02:36:25,150
Well,

2442
02:36:25,150 --> 02:36:29,020
the most important thing that's going
on is really the chapel sacred marriage

2443
02:36:29,021 --> 02:36:33,080
project. We're creating our
first sacred structure, right

2444
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,120
sample.
We're building it up there.

2445
02:36:36,180 --> 02:36:40,500
And it is an incredibly
important time for us. Uh,

2446
02:36:40,560 --> 02:36:44,550
if you look@alexgrey.com at
all, uh, well, let's see.

2447
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:48,900
And theone is really the, uh,
the, um, the thing that we're,

2448
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:50,130
we're working on now.

2449
02:36:50,280 --> 02:36:54,990
And that is this new sanctuary
for visionary art. And,

2450
02:36:55,190 --> 02:36:55,860
uh,

2451
02:36:55,860 --> 02:37:00,860
it is a multi denominational or trans
denominational acknowledgment of the power

2452
02:37:04,081 --> 02:37:07,590
of the creative spirit.
And it's occurring in architecture now.

2453
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:12,240
And it's a place to house, uh, the,
uh, this thing. It's something else.

2454
02:37:12,241 --> 02:37:16,060
And an I were shown in a dream.
And, uh, she is the cofounder

2455
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:20,750
of the chapel sacred mirrors.
She inspired the Sacred Mirror series.

2456
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:23,330
She named the sacred mirrors.

2457
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:28,780
So the honoring of the divine feminine
is really at the center of my life and

2458
02:37:29,631 --> 02:37:32,300
she turned my life around with her love.

2459
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:37,610
And so that kind of love
is, uh, and the creative,

2460
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:38,510
um,

2461
02:37:38,510 --> 02:37:43,280
evolutionary spirit that goes through
everybody is kind of what we celebrate at

2462
02:37:43,281 --> 02:37:47,790
Kozum. And, uh, so people
do a lot of creative. Um,

2463
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:50,570
you know, there's art church.
We just had an awesome,

2464
02:37:50,571 --> 02:37:54,200
our church with other visionary artists.
It's happening around the world.

2465
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:58,910
Visionary artists or like providing
cultural alternatives, you know,

2466
02:37:58,940 --> 02:38:02,180
where a likeminded people,

2467
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:05,890
we call them the love tribe because you
find them all over the world, you know,

2468
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:08,870
who've awakened to something beyond,
you know,

2469
02:38:08,871 --> 02:38:12,250
the stress full politically charged,
uh,

2470
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:15,950
national boundaries and
they're global citizens. They,

2471
02:38:16,310 --> 02:38:21,310
they are tapped into the world centric
intelligence that could help lead us to a

2472
02:38:22,221 --> 02:38:26,360
planetary civilization. And they, by the
way, probably didn't exist 50 years ago.

2473
02:38:26,420 --> 02:38:28,830
Yeah. So that's the big jump. Yeah.

2474
02:38:28,900 --> 02:38:32,090
It's one of the things when people want
to talk about how bad everything is,

2475
02:38:32,091 --> 02:38:33,930
they're not aware of how good it is to,
yeah.

2476
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:36,150
So chapel of secret
mirrors is a chocolate,

2477
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:41,500
what does the [inaudible] dot Org Alex
grey.com has just been a re a revised by

2478
02:38:44,181 --> 02:38:49,070
our dear friends falling and Scotty
beautiful. And, uh, so, uh, there,

2479
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:53,720
there will be updates about
[inaudible] and, uh, it, it, uh,

2480
02:38:53,930 --> 02:38:58,910
incredibly important step
for our community and,

2481
02:38:59,030 --> 02:39:02,440
and uh, for visionary
art. We hope. Listen man,

2482
02:39:02,450 --> 02:39:04,880
you just rocked a lot of
people's worlds today, Huh?

2483
02:39:05,290 --> 02:39:08,560
He threw a monkey wrench into the
gears of reality for a lot of folks.

2484
02:39:08,561 --> 02:39:10,480
I think that was awesome.
Thank you very much for doing this.

2485
02:39:10,481 --> 02:39:13,690
Anytime you want to do it again,
I would love to. That was,

2486
02:39:13,691 --> 02:39:15,610
it was just too much fun.
All right. Thank you brother.

2487
02:39:16,420 --> 02:39:20,350
Thanks to audible.com for

days and get a free audio book and a,

2490
02:39:29,060 --> 02:39:34,060
as Brian said, and I've said the Steve
Martin one, uh, on doing standup, it's,

2491
02:39:34,061 --> 02:39:36,400
what is it called? The standard
[inaudible] standing on standing up.

2492
02:39:36,790 --> 02:39:39,160
It's fucking amazing, man.
It's read by Steve Martin.

2493
02:39:39,161 --> 02:39:43,640
If I wanted to just introduce
you to something that would, uh,

2494
02:39:43,690 --> 02:39:48,460
get you to really appreciate the impact of
audio books, that's my, uh, personal, uh,

2495
02:39:48,461 --> 02:39:51,730
idea. Uh, that's, uh,
Brian's as well. It's, um,

2496
02:39:52,060 --> 02:39:55,330
it's a great choice. Give it a shot. But
there's a million books on there. I mean,

2497
02:39:55,331 --> 02:39:58,600
I don't know how many there are, but
that's an incredible amount of, uh,

2498
02:39:58,660 --> 02:40:03,390
interesting books on CD
or on audio rather. Uh,

2499
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:07,660
an MP three form that you can listen to
pretty much anywhere and it just makes

2500
02:40:07,661 --> 02:40:10,930
commutes and it makes
otherwise meaningless time.

2501
02:40:10,931 --> 02:40:14,520
It makes it educational and inspirational
and, uh, an awesome website.

2502
02:40:14,550 --> 02:40:16,140
audible.com forward slash Joe,

that, uh, we've started working with.

2506
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:34,110
Um, no contracts. The way
works is if your money,

2507
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:37,860
if you don't use all your minutes, you're
actually credited for the next month.

You got, you actually, they drop your
bill down and you're, you're credited.

2509
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:43,950
So it's a beautiful company and
they use the sprint backbone.

2510
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:47,840
So it's excellent
service. It's a, you know,

2511
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:51,930
a great a line of phones that
they use mostly android phones,

2512
02:40:51,931 --> 02:40:53,730
but they also have some a right,
if you're,

2513
02:40:53,770 --> 02:40:57,750
if you're one of those old school dudes
resisting change in you and to flip

2514
02:40:57,751 --> 02:41:02,520
phones, they even have those things. So go
and check that out, you freaks. And, uh,

2515
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:07,140
also thanks to [inaudible]
dot com for sponsoring our
podcasts. Go to O. N. N. I. T.

2516
02:41:07,141 --> 02:41:11,100
I checked, I can't find the blenders
online, so I guess they're not there yet,

2517
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:13,410
but just to let you know
the blenders on that way,

2518
02:41:13,411 --> 02:41:17,260
you dirty bitches and a kettle
bells are there. We have a,

2519
02:41:17,270 --> 02:41:20,910
an awesome supply of kettle
bells in various, um,

2520
02:41:21,240 --> 02:41:26,060
various weights and sizes. And we also
have packages. And, uh, we have the,

2521
02:41:26,061 --> 02:41:28,530
the battle ropes in as well,
which, uh, there's videos.

2522
02:41:28,530 --> 02:41:31,280
Explain how to use them and
what to do with them. It's,

2523
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:35,340
it's a awesome way to work out your entire
body. If you use a code name, Rogan,

2524
02:41:35,460 --> 02:41:39,030
you will save 10% off any and
all the supplements can't do.

2525
02:41:39,031 --> 02:41:40,920
You can't use that with kettle
bells and battle ropes though,

2526
02:41:40,921 --> 02:41:43,230
