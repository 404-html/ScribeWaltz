1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,880
Freak bitches

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,140
for the social justice warrior types
out there who might be listening.

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:07,651
It's like,

4
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:08,010
do you,

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,700
are you really willing to say that
every single person who's accomplished

6
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,550
something as done that as a
consequence of oppression,

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,510
that that's again what the Soviets claimed
with regards to the to the successful

8
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,740
peasants in the 19,

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,900
in the just before the 19 twenties.

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,590
It's like,

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,340
well,

12
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,400
the peasants were in demand,

13
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:24,781
some painted.

14
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,030
They were serfs until about 30
years before that they were served.

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,100
They were basically slaves and some of
them had clambered up to the point where

16
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:34,800
maybe they could have owned
their hot and a cow and couldn't.

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,800
You don't employ someone
while the Soviet claim was,

18
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,130
well,

19
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,060
that's all theft.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,091
You got that all [inaudible],

21
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:40,980
you're an oppressor.

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,090
And so then the Soviet intellectuals went
into the villages and just imagine how

23
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,611
this happened.

24
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:46,710
So imagine a village,

25
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,580
small town where everyone knows
everybody and there's maybe 10,

26
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,890
20 people there who are
moderately successful.

27
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:53,491
Okay?

28
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:57,930
And so you can imagine that those 20
people have like 100 enemies at the bottom

29
00:00:57,931 --> 00:00:59,760
of the socioeconomic distribution.

30
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:00,420
Useless,

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,841
horrible.

32
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:04,470
People who are jealous and resentful
about the fact that these people have been

33
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,304
successful.

34
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:05,641
Okay,

35
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:08,700
so now the intellectuals come
in and say property is theft,

36
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,200
success is oppression,

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,830
and then they looked for the people
in the village who are willing to move

38
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,900
against those 20 successful people.

39
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,610
Well those guys at the bottom,

40
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,230
those 100 resentful,

41
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:20,040
jealous,

42
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,850
murderous people at the bottom there just
waiting for an opportunity to go kick

43
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,090
down some doors and that's exactly
what they did in the 19 twenties.

44
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:27,631
And as I said,

45
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:31,350
they wiped out all their
productive peasants and then
6 million Ukrainian starve

46
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:32,184
to death.

47
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,210
They had posters.

48
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,090
The Soviets produced posters
in the 19 thirties that said,

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,613
essentially,

50
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,680
don't forget it's wrong
to eat your children.

51
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,760
So whoa.

52
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,181
Yeah,

53
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,014
whoa.

54
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,130
There's nothing about the Soviet.

55
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,240
There's nothing that you can imagine
that's horrible enough so that it matched

56
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,090
the reality of what happened
in the Soviet Union between 19,

57
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:58,470
19 in 1959.

58
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:58,600
Uh,

59
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,310
I think also technology is just,

60
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,480
it's just trying to get us
more and more addicted to it.

61
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,840
I was thinking of this the other day
and I was flying back from Hawaii.

62
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I was thinking of how many people I
see stare at a phone at the airport,

63
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,400
at the fucking mall,

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,220
at a restaurant myself.

65
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,920
I'm staring at my own phone
and I'm not immune to it.

66
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,590
We're all staring at
fucking phones and I'm like,

67
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,270
if I was a pilgrim,

68
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,493
if you took,

69
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,970
you went back in a time machine,

70
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:31,750
you grabbed a pilgrim and
dragged them to 2016 and he said,

71
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:32,584
what are you saying?

72
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,321
It be like,

73
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,240
oh my God,

74
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,330
they're all prisoners
to the looking glass.

75
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,380
He'd been captured like slipped
runners spell under a spell.

76
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,650
They stare at a fucking glass
screen first thing in the morning.

77
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,240
They check their email to go to work.

78
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,230
They stare at a screen.

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,920
They look at their navigation system
while they're fucking driving to work.

80
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,670
They get home,

81
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,410
they watch tv before they go to bed.

82
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:54,670
They check their email again.

83
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,920
They're just staring at fucking screens.

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,870
They're living their
lives through screens.

85
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,480
I would think that looking glass,

86
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,950
it's captivated though.

87
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,710
I would think they were
under the spell of glass,

88
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,780
like there was something
about something bond.

89
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,650
They're not moving.

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
They're just sitting there in front
of this fucking thing all day.

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,510
They're almost.

92
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,810
There's almost no movement.

93
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,750
Almost all the time you're
in front of a screen.

94
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,860
You're just sitting there.

95
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,030
Yeah.

96
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,140
If you saw that and you had no idea what
the fuck a television was or a phone,

97
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,870
you were just a person from
another time period and he said,

98
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,704
what do you think's going on?

99
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,600
Like with these fucking
people are under a spell.

100
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,550
They're clearly under a spell.

101
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,990
Like it's given them something.

102
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,380
Yeah,

103
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,430
but that's what a spell his fucking.

104
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:34,930
When the,

105
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,100
the,

106
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,391
the,

107
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:38,950
the hypnotic dancer dances in front of
you and then all of a sudden you don't

108
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,970
even know where you are anymore.

109
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,220
It's because you're looking at
something cool at the Strip club.

110
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,630
Exactly.

111
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,961
There you go.

112
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:44,794
Nowhere you are.

113
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,020
Yeah.

114
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,800
You ate the edible.

115
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,310
Did Joey Diaz gave you that
was mislabeled on purpose.

116
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,920
This is what you're seeing.

117
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,950
You're seeing something amazing and that
amazing thing is making you want more

118
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,630
of it so you're.

119
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,370
You're spending more money to get a better
computer to make better explosions on

120
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:07,660
the bigger screen that has the better
sound and it keeps going deeper and deeper

121
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:11,470
and every fucking new phone has some
new way to get you excited and you keep.

122
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,530
You're staring at the newest and best
screen and it just locked into this sort

123
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:20,560
of hypnotic trance of technology.

124
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,011
Oh,

125
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:21,540
it allows.

126
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,630
It allows you to Bluetooth with your
navigation so it syncs up to your car and

127
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,930
like you're still staring at a
fucking screen and not doing anything.

128
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,670
It doesn't matter what's happening.

129
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,010
The same effect is taking place.

130
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,780
You're staring at a screen.

131
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,770
I've identified this sort of thing.

132
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,663
Um,

133
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,480
the,

134
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,630
an idea I've been working on
called Yellowstone Syndrome though,

135
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,010
is where people,

136
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
Americans,

137
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,290
some,

138
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,920
so many of them,

139
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,670
their only idea about wildlife and
wildlife politics and wildlife management

140
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,790
comes from the yellowstone story.

141
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,830
That they wind up having a difficult
time understanding wildlife and wildlife

142
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,100
management in situations that are
outside of a national park setting.

143
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,920
Which is to say they don't have a very
good grasp on the inevitable conflicts

144
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,100
that are going to arise between wildlife
and society and that's a large chunk of

145
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:16,370
ground where you just do not
have those sorts of conflicts.

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,870
Like what kind of conflicts
were talking about.

147
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,231
Oh,

148
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,370
like for instance,

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,660
a thing has been very difficult and very
vexing for wildlife managers is what

150
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:27,860
happens to what happens to
buffalo when they leave national.

151
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,480
The yellowstone national park.

152
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,530
I'm just,

153
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:31,980
I mean,

154
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,813
tobacco on the,

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,700
on the yellowstone is she goes to get
a sense for how revolutionary that idea

156
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:38,534
was.

157
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,260
You know,

158
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,770
there was the Indian wars weren't
even over when they made yellowstone.

159
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:43,604
Yellowstone,

160
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,250
you know,

161
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,390
we,

162
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,680
we were still battling American
Indians on the great plains.

163
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,700
When you also want it to affect,

164
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:50,061
matter of fact,

165
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:55,061
yellowstone was a park when the Nez perce
were chased through by the US army and

166
00:05:57,201 --> 00:06:01,490
they actually killed a couple terrorists
in yellowstone bright as some of the

167
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,450
buildings that are still there.

168
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
Wow.

169
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,340
Yeah.

170
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,930
So you were,

171
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,930
you went to yellowstone and got shot by
Indians who were engaged in a war with

172
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:12,524
the US army.

173
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,890
Wow.

174
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,723
It was like a,

175
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,150
it was a,

176
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,530
it was like they hadn't even,

177
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,070
you know,

178
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,940
the West hadn't even been in some ways
that the center west hadn't even been

179
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,680
settled and they were made and they made
a national park and then Roosevelt went

180
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:28,250
there and uh,

181
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,491
you know,

182
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,660
at the commemoration to like,

183
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:30,494
it was,

184
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,341
you know,

185
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,140
went there to applaud it,

186
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,780
you know,

187
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,140
people look at me as if I still
don't have my shit together,

188
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,510
but the only thing that I did was I took
appeal that I thought was gonna give me

189
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,344
a boner.

190
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,370
And it literally,

191
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,430
it's caused me a lot of heartache and
a lot of disappointment and a lot of it

192
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,653
just threw me

193
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,501
way,

194
00:06:50,501 --> 00:06:51,221
shape or form.

195
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,530
When someone gives you this pill and
you don't know where it came from,

196
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:53,921
you don't know.

197
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:55,300
What did you think,

198
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:55,601
man?

199
00:06:55,601 --> 00:06:56,500
I don't know what's in this.

200
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,561
No,

201
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:57,891
I didn't.

202
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,101
No,

203
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:59,360
I didn't think of it because,

204
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,194
um,

205
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,630
I had been dealing with
the athletic commission.

206
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,830
I've been in the UFC for a long time
and I've taken a little gas station,

207
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:07,581
take pills before,

208
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:08,090
like,

209
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,391
you know,

210
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,224
like,

211
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,050
and I've never felt the drug test ever.

212
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,810
Did you ever think that
you might have got lucky?

213
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:15,321
No,

214
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,160
I didn't think I got lucky.

215
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,620
I thought that you failed drug tests
when you're doing sketchy shit.

216
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:18,921
Right?

217
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,590
But didn't you think there might be
some sketchy shit and some Chinese?

218
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,961
No.

219
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:22,910
Station Rhino.

220
00:07:22,911 --> 00:07:23,690
Dick pill?

221
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,290
I,

222
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:24,531
I,

223
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,100
um,

224
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,240
what you know about the rhinos?

225
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,991
My friend Ryan,

226
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,040
my friend Brian called it,

227
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:28,881
he was on the,

228
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,810
on the podcast.

229
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,650
He said,

230
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,970
know John Likes to party.

231
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,570
I bet he took them

232
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,470
one of them Dick Pills.

233
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,280
Um,

234
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,641
no.

235
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:35,474
Um,

236
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,040
it's funny you called it.

237
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,850
Yeah,

238
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:38,660
well he was,

239
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,493
he was on

240
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,000
who's watching this video online
yesterday of this girl who is a,

241
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,240
she's like a Vegan activist who had
this video about why do we Turkey on

242
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:50,751
Thanksgiving.

243
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,130
It's a really well done video.

244
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,930
She's very,

245
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,930
it's very smartly edited and very smartly
narrated and she starts talking about

246
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,140
the Turkey industry,

247
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:01,520
but she sets it up really well.

248
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,470
Like what did we just sort of do it,

249
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:07,520
like why do we turn and then she takes
you to this Mike Rowe episode where they

250
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:12,050
show how they get Turkey come and that
all these turkeys are so they're so

251
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,610
overbred and fucked up and
they're so big so quick,

252
00:08:14,611 --> 00:08:17,760
you literally can't physically have
sex and they can watch on the catwalk.

253
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,370
And so these artificial insemination
and so this guy has to literally talk,

254
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,990
talk sweet to them.

255
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,231
Yeah,

256
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,190
you gotta start sweet to them.

257
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,840
They have this Turkey's legs clamp
down on this machine and then he's like

258
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,140
touching it and with a tube.

259
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,960
Uh,

260
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,390
and it's like holy because it has
one hole and the sucking it in,

261
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:39,640
sucking it out with a straw.

262
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,610
Turkey's got to be like,

263
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:42,800
what the fuck going.

264
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,030
Exactly.

265
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,870
He's getting settled.

266
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,763
He's coming.

267
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,030
This guy has a tube.

268
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,030
He's sucking the come out
of this Turkey's whole,

269
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:50,211
you know,

270
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:53,480
because they have like that one sort
of universal whole for everything.

271
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,020
Yeah.

272
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,470
And as he sucking to out of it,

273
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:56,191
he has a glass,

274
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,590
a bottle of water with them because
sometimes it gets in his mouth.

275
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,200
So he has to clean it out,

276
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,340
like kind of a fucking job,

277
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,570
but this is the only way
you can get this stuff.

278
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,700
This dude Turkey rape should be illegal,

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
totally illegal.

280
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,820
But it's amazing that
nobody talks about that.

281
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,470
But everybody talks about like
force feeding ducks to get fog wall.
