1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,780
The joe rogan experience.
I'm not, you know, I don't,

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,660
I don't spend a lot of time with,
with other water unless there,

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,790
there were those who were deeply
admire who I see every now and again,

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:12,750
like Sebastian younger. Um, but I'm not, I
don't, I don't hang out with them day in,

5
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:16,920
day out. So there's levels
to the involvement. Yeah.

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,970
To weather how deeply you're
immersed. And it's, it's,

7
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:22,950
it's completely upside down
in the state because the TV,

8
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:26,970
new Gen TV news journalists aren't
deeply involved and just want to get that

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:30,690
quick shot of them looking like they're
somewhere Middle East and he closest to

10
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,540
the front line with the flak jacket on
the perfectly ironed shirt and they're

11
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,620
not, they're not sweating or even worse.
The Brian Williams type situation. Yeah,

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,780
yeah.
Or on the roof of the five star hotel.

13
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:43,170
Sometimes you might see people report
about what's happening with Isis and

14
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:45,000
they're in Beirut.
Right.

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:47,700
And I think they're relying on the fact
that a lot of people don't understand

16
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:51,120
that's a different country.
Um, but you know, those guys,

17
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:54,480
some of those guys are paid millions
and treated very, very well.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,800
The photographers and print journalists
who are immersed and last spending weeks

19
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,510
there,

20
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,520
I sometimes struggling to make a living
and aren't well known and aren't well

21
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,330
supported.

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,500
What is it about the talking head in
front of the camera that we want so badly?

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,780
I mean I think it's, it's, it's a way
for the news networks to, to, you know,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,420
claim credibility and then
when you see them get deployed,

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,530
they're not focused on getting material
from the war in these countries.

26
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,930
They're focused on the,
on the two way, right?

27
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,470
[inaudible] shark guy from wherever.
Right.

28
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,440
That's more important than actually
spending days collecting footage of what's

29
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,274
actually going on.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It seems like you see that rarely if
ever these days it's more and more rare.

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,700
It, it seemed to me that
during like Desert Storm, um,

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,290
in the 90s there was always someone that
was over there and it seemed like there

33
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:46,080
was real threat and it
was really going on.

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,560
But now everything seems to be done from
the desk and you don't really see a lot

35
00:01:51,631 --> 00:01:54,490
of, I mean, am I right about that?
Yeah. I mean, I think emotional,

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,730
a lot of the major news
networks said to their crews,

37
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,250
you're not allowed to spend
the night in Mosul. You know,

38
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,340
you can go there and film a street,

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,600
interview some refugees who
just escaped isis territory,

40
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,400
but you can't spend days on end there.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,950
Whereas the freelance photographers
and some of the writers,

42
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:11,130
they were spending days on end there
and getting, getting the real stuff.

43
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,750
Is it because the on camera
people will be targeted? Um,

44
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,690
I just think the risk is too high,
full stop for the entire crew.

45
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,010
And certainly if you know,

46
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:22,860
when a story is really big and you
send one of the very well known

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,700
correspondence there, then yeah, they
can't be running around, you know,

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,420
filming house to house fighting.

49
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,140
So when you're over there and you see
these guys show up and you know that

50
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:34,530
they're just going to be hanging out
with the hotel and what does that feel in

51
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:38,790
like, uh, yeah, I mean, I'm
pretty disdainful of those. Yeah.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,190
Those guys you have to be, yeah.
Yeah. You see these films like, um,

53
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,680
whiskey, tango, Foxtrot about
Afghanistan and I just, yeah,

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,230
I just don't recognize that that world,
you know,

55
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,660
partying every night at whatever
bar or restaurant. I just,

56
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,020
I just think if you're there and you're
obviously in the wrong place, right,

57
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,290
right. And it's not, it's
not an adventure, you know,

58
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,180
it's not a fun trip for you of,
of wild times and you know, it's,

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,050
it shouldn't be that. It
should be, um, I mean from,

60
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,970
it feels like an endurance
test every time you go.

61
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,330
It should be hard and you should be
spending time with the people you're

62
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:12,250
covering. And you know, sometimes you can,

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,280
you can think you're finished with
someone and just go for dinner or tea.

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,170
And just by having normal
human conversations,

65
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,010
you find out so much other stuff that
you didn't go there to report. You know,

66
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:22,810
that's, that's, that's what you have
to be doing. And that takes weeks,

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,220
weeks of getting closer to them and gain
their trust. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And just,

68
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:30,000
just, just, you know, spending
enough time there where you,

69
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,190
you then end up being in the right place
at the right time to show something

70
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,270
really happening.
Yeah.

71
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,450
It was unfortunate that I had to take
that from him and I kind of, in a sense,

72
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,410
I felt like I was taken away
from what he was doing for them.

73
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,480
So when I saw her walking backstage, I
just couldn't control it. I just let,

74
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,520
I just let go and I just can help
but cry on her shoulders. Disagree.

75
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:54,510
It's a great video. What is her name was
woman's actresses. Roma Downey. Yeah,

76
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,340
that's her right there.

77
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,870
The video is amazing cause she's
hugging you and she's Talon you.

78
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,020
Congratulations.
And she's telling you that they're coming,

79
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,020
they're going to be coming
for you. So train hard. Yeah.

80
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,290
And it's just like her attitude, man.
It's beautiful, man. It's, it's, um,

81
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:14,090
it's amazing her character that she
handled that. I mean, this is her baby.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,920
Her baby just lost and lost every
round and it was a, you know,

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,050
pretty dominant victory by you and for
her to treat you that way afterwards to

84
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:26,300
shows amazing character. Yeah.
And it's, Sarah is right here.

85
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,700
You can see it up here. Look at her.
She just embraces you. Open arms.

86
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,670
It's all good. It's all
good baby. Look at that.

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
Oh,
amazing.

88
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,100
That's an amazing woman right there.
He bought work a couple of phone calls.

89
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,820
So you take it too. Oh good. Wow.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,890
That's amazing man. And even Tyron, the
way tire and here, it's crazy, right?

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,680
It makes me cry. Something in the
air over here. I've got to do it.

92
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,590
I got it made me cry when I saw it.
It's making me cry now. Yeah, man. Um,

93
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,510
and in the way she treated tire into the
same thing. I mean, she's just, that's,

94
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:12,350
and that, that's, that's kind
of, that's how my mom is to that.

95
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,620
So I felt such a connection to that to
her because my mom has the exact same

96
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:22,250
way. My mom would have done the same
thing to Tyron. And um, it just,

97
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,980
it was powerful, man. It was
moving. And because it's,

98
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,470
and it goes through a test to how the
sport has, how bay this sport is as well.

99
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,700
Yeah. Like it's not all man,
that's just a regular fight.

100
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,000
You guys hate each other and
you were fighting. No, this
was a competition. Yeah.

101
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,290
You know, this was two men that went in
there too for a competition and one guy,

102
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,210
one and you know,

103
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,370
and you saw the aftermath is see
the family receive each other. Yeah.

104
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,090
People loved that man. They
love when people put all
that bullshit aside. I mean,

105
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:56,170
you guys had a lot of trash talk at the
press conferences and there was a lot of

106
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:57,980
that going on,
but that tickets and

107
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,510
it's good for everybody and it's, it's
natural and normal. But after it was over,

108
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,600
it was nothing but respect.
Can I, can I pause here?
Leptin is produced where? Yeah,

109
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,130
Leptin is produced. Yeah. Let's
talk about linkedin a little bit.

110
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,290
It's produced in fat cells,
um,

111
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,130
and it's produced in proportion
to the size of fat tissue.

112
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,190
So the amount of body fat you have,
the more fat you have,

113
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:23,030
the more Leptin you have in the
circulation. And basically what this is,

114
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,580
it's what's called a
negative feedback loop,

115
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:30,200
which is a really simple engineering
term that works like a thermostat.

116
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,960
So with your Thermostat,
you uh,

117
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,150
if you set your thermostat to 70,
if it starts getting a little bit hotter,

118
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,720
your ac turns on to bring it back
down at the starts getting lower,

119
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,840
ac comes on or the heat
comes on to bring it up.

120
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,610
That's called a negative feedback system
and it maintains the stability of the

121
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,840
temperature of your house.

122
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,850
We have many negative feedback loops
in the human body to regulate body

123
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:59,330
temperature, to regulate blood pressure,
to regulate all sorts of things.

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,460
One of the negative feedback loops we
have regulates body fatness and the

125
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:09,230
hormones. So your, your
thermostat measures temperature
by using a thermostat,

126
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,780
a Saria,
a thermometer,

127
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,890
your brain measures body fatness using
this hormone leptin that's in the

128
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:20,450
circulation. And then particularly
when your body fat level drops,

129
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,820
your Leptin levels drop and your brain
hears that and it kicks in a starvation

130
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,900
response basically.

131
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,500
And this is the main reason why weight
loss is so difficult because your brain

132
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:34,880
is like, no, I don't want to be
losing fat. And it makes you hungrier.

133
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:39,500
It increases your cravings at a
certain level of body fat as a sub. Um,

134
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,230
so here's is just when you're
losing body fat in general,

135
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,690
like even if you're a large
person that's overweight, correct.

136
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,980
When you're losing body fat in general,
your body, it exacerbates your hunger.

137
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,611
And this is,

138
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:54,080
this is the thing that's really important
to understand about obesity is that

139
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,080
people with obesity
have a higher set point.

140
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:01,520
So it's like turning your thermostat from
70 to 80 and then your thermostats and

141
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,950
regulating around 80 people with obesity,

142
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,260
they're not regulating
around one 70 anymore.

143
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:11,261
They're regulating around two 50 and
so when you cause a lean person to lose

144
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:11,960
weight,

145
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,500
you see the same thing is when you cause
a person with obesity to lose weight,

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,800
you see this reaction in their brain
circuits that regulate body fatness that

147
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:26,030
drives them to increase their cravings
and their hunger to metabolic rate drops.

148
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,840
So it'd be an evolutionary mechanism
to force you to seek food. Correct.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,420
And not just the foresee to seek food,
that's the main thing.

150
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,430
But it also slows your metabolic rate,

151
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,810
does everything it can to get more energy
in your body and have less leaving.

152
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:42,410
And it keeps doing that until the fat
comes back. Can I pause here? Yeah.

153
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:47,090
So when you're eating a sugary
diet, a high, high calorie diet,

154
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,510
you will produce more fat. Your
body will get fatter, right?

155
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,530
It depends on how many calories
you're eating. If you're overeating,

156
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,040
you consuming a lot of sugar,

157
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,230
a lot of carbohydrates, your
body will get fatter. Correct.

158
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:02,040
So your body will produce more Leptin.
Correct. So it comes from the Diet.

159
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,070
Um, yeah. Indirectly.
Definitely not. Yeah.

160
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,710
Yeah. Pause please. Yeah. I played the
nine holes of golf with him. Was it like,

161
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,660
and uh, it was, well,

162
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,900
there's still security
secret service all around it.

163
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,580
And so it was a private golf course.
Uh,

164
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,510
Larry Ellison a that
owns oracle. Oh Wow. Uh,

165
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,180
owns this private golf course.
It has 14, he's a big tennis guy,

166
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:32,330
so he puts on the tennis stuff out in
palm springs and nobody plays his course

167
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:35,020
and he doesn't play golf. And uh, Eh,

168
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,330
it's just his practice is to deal
[inaudible] course get is. Yeah,

169
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:39,310
he's got his own courses.

170
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,170
He played through our group and
shadow creek and Beverly Hill,

171
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:50,060
I mean in, in Vegas. It really exclusive
course, impossible to get on. And,

172
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:53,120
and he was playing by himself and
he was gone the tee box and I said,

173
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,400
as lonely at the top area. He goes, yeah.

174
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,790
And his ball and went off by himself.
And uh, but he wasn't even there but,

175
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,000
but Clinton was,
and he told me a story goes,

176
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,060
his friend of his as a record producer,
rap records big.

177
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,760
I didn't tell me who it was and didn't
tell me who the artist was either.

178
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:14,870
But the artists was all dug down and
he was in a Ferrari store and, and uh,

179
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,260
and uh, the salesman, he goes, are
you thinking about buying this car?

180
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,060
And the guy goes, no, I'm going to
buy the car. I'm thinking about pussy.

181
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,020
So the Glen told me a story that
had the word [inaudible] in it.

182
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,640
And Clinton Clinton told me that.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,380
That's a great fucking story.
Yeah.

184
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,250
So, so Nietzsche and Schopenhauer talked
about the idea that there's the well,

185
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:44,000
right? So as a human being, you're
stuck in this fucking, I got to eat,

186
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,751
I've got to fuck,

187
00:10:44,751 --> 00:10:49,751
I got to sleep and I got to breed and
I eat and I sleep and I fucked so I can

188
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,920
breathe, you know, and I can stay
alive. And then my, you know,

189
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,410
further my gene pool and you're stuck in
this kind of like will to live theirs.

190
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,260
But there is a response. And
that respite is, is when you,

191
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,170
when you see a great work of art
or you're doing great works of art.

192
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,130
And somehow when you see
something beautiful, when
you're laughing, really hard,

193
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:10,280
equate standard, when you're seeing them
an amazing movie like American beauty,

194
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,570
the state it puts you in is so
incredible because it gets you to forget

195
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,250
momentarily about your own biology,
about your own urges, your own needs,

196
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:23,750
your own wants for whatever reason you,
you rest in this state of majesty,

197
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:27,260
this sort of high relief, this your
higher self. And you go, you go man,

198
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:28,910
that might be what God's about.

199
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:33,440
And that might be what it's like to be
touching something bigger than myself or

200
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,780
bigger than all of this other appetite
stuff. Like I, it's almost like, um,

201
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,770
it's almost like something you,

202
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:42,080
you forget that you forget about death
and you forget about your fears and

203
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:42,711
everything else.
You know,

204
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:46,100
that those feelings of inspiration that
can happen when you're listening to

205
00:11:46,101 --> 00:11:49,640
great music or it can happen
when you're making great music.

206
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,460
But that is almost the only time you have.
Um,

207
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,690
I guess,

208
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,970
and of course we can talk about flow
and you're climbing a mountain with no

209
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,170
ropes or whatever it might be.

210
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,000
I think that puts you in those
states of true focus and true flow.

211
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,590
And, um, that's what we stay
alive for. We stay alive for that.

212
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,150
And when you are not that,
you know,

213
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,300
everything else becomes drudgery
almost because everything becomes,

214
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,960
and I would even, I would even
equate like, oh, we stay alive also,

215
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:22,990
not just for our accomplishments,
but like when you're with your friends,

216
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:25,780
like when we're doing the fight companion
and we're laughing and being silly

217
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:30,130
game for no other reason. There is a flow
to that. Oh yeah. There's a, there's a,

218
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,170
you are, you are removed for
temporarily from the world, from,

219
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:38,250
from, from the reality of your
own limitations. And there,

220
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,420
there's something that's
so beautiful about that.

221
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,400
I think Nietzsche talked
about the idea that you can,

222
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,700
you can actually make your life that
your life should be a work of art,

223
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,820
live dangerously and leave a good
looking corpse. Don't, don't,

224
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,320
don't worry about all the other things.

225
00:12:59,610 --> 00:12:59,670
Okay.
