1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,770
And also it's like try getting really
high on a really good weed and start

3
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:11,430
thinking about those fucking drones
zooming around Afghanistan and blast and

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:16,410
missiles at kids and it's like you'll
really start getting a clear understanding

5
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:18,360
of how fucked up that is.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:18,991
You know,

7
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:22,740
no matter what even let's say even
those drone attacks we had to do them,

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,090
it's still fucked up.

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,880
It still creates more of
a sensitivity towards,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:27,780
um,

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,750
people getting their limbs
blown off of their bodies,

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,780
um,

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,260
in the pursuit of some ridiculous war.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,370
And that kind of,

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:35,970
you know,

16
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,430
that's hitting the military
industrial complex.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,240
It's hitting the pharmaceutical companies
because if you start getting high,

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,270
you're going to start experiencing a,

19
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,720
a better level of happiness.

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,120
It's going to make you start
dealing with your bullshit.

21
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,250
Or maybe it'll make you
depressed because you're lazy,

22
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,360
but either way,

23
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:55,500
it won't allow you to like sink into the
kind of sedated hypnosis that it seems

24
00:00:55,501 --> 00:01:00,360
like that works really
fucking well for Applebee's.

25
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:00,871
You know,

26
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:03,000
it works really well for the corporations,

27
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:08,001
for people to be in a sedated hypnotic
state where they can really make sense of

28
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:14,070
going down to a shopping mall
and and like eating at a fucking,

29
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,120
I dunno,

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,470
chicken place with their,

31
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,280
with their kids and then
going up and buying some shit.

32
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,790
I'm a shoe store and then spending
their day just consuming shit they don't

33
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:27,270
really need and then going home and
sitting back to watch TV with more

34
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:30,780
advertisements and not thinking that's
weird and falling asleep and that kind of

35
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:35,550
depress lumber that is really
hard to do if you're high,

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,290
if you're really high,

37
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,650
it's really hard to watch
normal TV and not be like,

38
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,540
this is horrible.

39
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,820
Look at these advertisements.

40
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:45,654
Are you kidding?

41
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,790
They think that that
that's going to work on me.

42
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,990
Oh my God,

43
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,820
$48,000 for a fucking car
you're going to pay for.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,010
That's like over a year's wage.

45
00:01:56,011 --> 00:02:00,540
For some people you're going to make sense
of buying a brand new car payments of

46
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,460
$285 a month.

47
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,990
When you for like four grand,

48
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,640
you can go buy a fucking car,

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,510
get it fixed up through the year and have
like a shitload extra money and not be

50
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,260
in debt.

51
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,670
That's what pot makes you think.

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,460
If you're,

53
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:12,661
you know,

54
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:17,160
but if you're like drunk and you're
fucking scratching your balls and watching

55
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,980
the game and a fucking the new Lexus,

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,030
you'll start thinking like,

57
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:21,301
well,

58
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,160
my credit score went up this year.

59
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,900
I think I might be able to take out a
loan from the bank and get a new Lexus.

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,590
Even though you're fucking broke and
living in hell and it's going to just

61
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,560
create this weight on your budget
that's going to make you miserable.

62
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,280
Dude,

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,390
I don't mean to go on a long rant,

64
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,480
but did I ever tell you the time a friend
of mine picked me up and his fucking

65
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,280
Mercedes and took me to his apartment.

66
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,330
They would tell you this.

67
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,720
No.

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,710
You had a brand new Mercedes and I know
this guy knew what his job was picking

69
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:48,690
me up in his and I knew
he can afford a Mercedes.

70
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,910
Picks me up in his brand
new Mercedes and he's like,

71
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,061
Hey,

72
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,230
I got to stop by my apartment.

73
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:53,220
Come inside for a second,

74
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,020
go into his apartment.

75
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,480
It is a size of a fucking closet.

76
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,850
It is the smallest I've
ever seen in my life.

77
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,930
Like barely could eat like he had to like
kind of like almost like walk sideways

78
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,570
against the wall to get around
the bed to get to the bathroom.

79
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:10,960
It's like a New York style just shit box.

80
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,580
Meanwhile that guy's car payments
have gotta be like five 5,600 a month.

81
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:20,581
I mean this is a nice fucking Mercedes
and in his mind he had like his logic

82
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:25,150
behind it was like yeah it's better to
have like a really nice car then like a

83
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,590
comfortable living situation.

84
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,590
I talk about this like a d one last thing.

85
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,370
That guy is a tramp Daemon cause why?

86
00:03:32,371 --> 00:03:36,460
Cause he's a tramp demon because Trump
see that Mercedes and they're like let's

87
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,700
go back to your apartment cause they
think he's rich and then they get in this

88
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,250
tiny little fucking shitty closet space.

89
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,930
We have some rap about that.

90
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,410
They're making my new
place or fixing up town.

91
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:47,860
I'm staying here for a little while.

92
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,643
Yeah.

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,670
So fucking set the look on those Trump's
face when they walk in that door and

94
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,190
realize that they barely room to stand.

95
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,670
There's like two feet of carpet
between the door and the bed.

96
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,540
There's a lot of people who believe in
those really small sustainable houses.

97
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:04,841
You know,

98
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:06,250
that people are making these like really,

99
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,450
really little houses and you like move
things out for the kitchen and move

100
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,480
things up in the bed is like a
little scenario and you know,

101
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,131
and yeah,

102
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:14,940
like it's,

103
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,720
it's like a whole trend on the internet.

104
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,460
There's a lot of people who
are doing that and that's cool.

105
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,740
I don't think there's anything
wrong about living simply.

106
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,260
It's just hilarious when people,

107
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,640
uh,

108
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,070
oh yeah,

109
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,291
no,

110
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,440
they throw themselves into a hellish debt,

111
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,040
uh,

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,510
for a symbol and,

113
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:28,801
and,

114
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,191
and well,

115
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:29,980
it's not just that,

116
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,431
honestly,

117
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:30,731
it's a,

118
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,030
you,

119
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,341
you,

120
00:04:31,341 --> 00:04:31,690
you,

121
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,370
you enjoy the fuck out of a nice car.

122
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
You get an a Mercedes.

123
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,400
You can't believe you're
allowed to drive this thing.

124
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,240
Everywhere you go,

125
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,280
people look at you like you
must be special looking at,

126
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,390
he's getting into that Mercedes.

127
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:40,631
I'm like,

128
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,351
oh my God.

129
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:44,950
For a lot of people that is a tangible
benefit of having a car like that they

130
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,910
liked this quarter.

131
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,650
You could say it's shallow all day,

132
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:49,960
but men driving one of
those things is beautiful.

133
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,310
It's an amazing piece of
engineering and as a a year head,

134
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,160
you know I'm sort of a minor league area
because I don't know exactly how all

135
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:57,560
that works.

136
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,060
Yeah.

137
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,070
But like Adam Corollas,

138
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,320
like a legit gearhead and
he can like build cars.

139
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,650
I just like buy them from people who know
how to build them and they appreciate

140
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,251
the fuck out of him.

141
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,210
I think they're interesting.

142
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,190
But the driving one you've drive like
a really well engineered piece of,

143
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,053
it's amazing,

144
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,750
man.

145
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,021
I,

146
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:16,780
if I had shit shitloads of money,

147
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,120
I would buy a nice car and I
wouldn't feel weird about it.

148
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:24,121
Cause anything to like to to dull the
fucking existential harder that comes over

149
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,550
me on the one oh one and traffic.

150
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,750
That's beautiful.

151
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm just saying when those commercials,

152
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,643
you know they're are,

153
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,300
they're not just appealing to rich people,

154
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:34,690
they're,

155
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:34,990
they're,

156
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,990
they're manipulating eds into somehow
convincing them that logically makes sense

157
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,800
to get in debt to a bank for 50 grand.

158
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,910
It's not just idiots.

159
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,800
It's people that are not happy.

160
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,020
That's what they're
offering you happiness.

161
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,380
See,

162
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,450
most people throughout their day,

163
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,810
they have a job that can
occasionally be interesting,

164
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:57,320
but they would never fucking do for free.

165
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,050
And whether they're good at or not,

166
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,590
it takes some sense of
pride in their work.

167
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:01,424
They get through their day,

168
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,840
but they're fucking tired,

169
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,171
man.

170
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:04,880
And people were unsatisfied.

171
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,070
They feel like they
worked so fucking hard.

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,320
They put so much and what am I getting?

173
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:10,610
I'm just existing.

174
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,721
This is what I'm doing.

175
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:12,554
I'm existing.

176
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,790
So what do they do?

177
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,200
They get fucking shit.

178
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,700
They buy a new bowling ball.

179
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,534
They get a new,

180
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,240
they get a new Lexus and no one for them.

181
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:20,511
You know,

182
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:21,770
for some of them you say it's sad,

183
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:23,660
but for some of those guys
that are stuck in that life,

184
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:24,530
no matter what they do,

185
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,070
that might prevent that might give
them like a little bit more happiness

186
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,600
driving,

187
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,250
you know,

188
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:29,710
plastic,

189
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,260
a nice new Mustang and the way
that word classic fucking fruit.

190
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,140
I mean really the idea
is get underneath that.

191
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:36,651
Don't start.

192
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,110
You're starting at the top start way deep.

193
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,980
Start down deep and then worry about
the fucking Mercedes and yes for you.

194
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,030
Yes,

195
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,840
for you,

196
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,351
for you,

197
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,430
for a guy who thinks,

198
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,880
but for someone who's just locked into
the life of a drone and accepts it and

199
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,450
Nice Little Red Mercedes,

200
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,284
look at that.

201
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,060
Look at the look on Bob's face.

202
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,321
He's so happy.

203
00:06:57,321 --> 00:06:58,910
Then he gets into his red Mercedes.

204
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,770
Even in the girls,

205
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:01,604
hey girls,

206
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,110
I don't buy Mercedes,

207
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:03,944
but I did.

208
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,380
I get myself in debt.

209
00:07:06,381 --> 00:07:07,191
Always have been.

210
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,130
I did the same shit.

211
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:10,490
I don't buy Mercedes or
our go to that crazy.

212
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,600
But my shit was always like,

213
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,990
I grew up super poor and
then now I have credits.

214
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,840
So now I could buy things and Duke,

215
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,140
like the most of my life was like,

216
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,340
hand me down shit.

217
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,091
Or you know,

218
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,680
like shitty toys or you know,

219
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,180
just not like you walk,

220
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,120
you live in a neighborhood with a bunch
of kids and get anything they wanted.

221
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,750
Growing up,

222
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,201
I can't,

223
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,940
I don't have to see these kids.

224
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,511
And you're like,

225
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:29,811
wow,

226
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,950
you got vultron,

227
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
how'd you get Voltron?

228
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,610
That's just like $80 you know?

229
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,270
And then now you're an adult,

230
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,140
you're kind of over like,

231
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,701
you feel like,

232
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,280
I deserve this because I didn't
have that stuff growing up.

233
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:40,391
I,

234
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,570
I want what I want.

235
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:41,781
You know,

236
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:42,170
like,

237
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,490
like these kids always had growing.

238
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,460
He fucking like objects have to sue them,

239
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,490
give me a big computer monitor and fucking
world of Warcraft and some medicinal

240
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:54,320
marijuana and that's all I need.

241
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,570
And that costs 1399 a month.

242
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:04,230
Okay.
