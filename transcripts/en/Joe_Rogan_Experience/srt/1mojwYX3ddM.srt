1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,700
Oh my goodness.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,820
here we go again.
Here we go again.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,430
This episode of the Joe Rogan 
experience.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,630
I just did some UFC stuff today,
so I almost said the ultimate insider,

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,590
the Arctic Joe Rogan.
And trying to switch gears.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,840
I switched gears from Sports Guy 
Persona.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,060
Uh,
we uh,

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,040
were sponsored by Ting.
Ting is a,

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,100
a mobile company.
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,250
you can see all the information and you 
could also save 25 bucks off of any of 

11
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:37,380
their phones or,
or the service I believe,

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,880
I believe it's applicable to a either or
with ting is,

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,881
is a very ethical cell phone company.
And what they're trying to do is they're

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,750
trying to offer you the same service 
that a big network like sprint would 

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,781
offer you,
but they're trying to make it so that 

16
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,160
you can cancel anytime you want and 
there's no hidden fees and they,

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:58,690
uh,
they,

18
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,740
they have it set up so that if you 
don't,

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,760
uh,
if you don't use a certain amount of 

20
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:06,760
minutes,
say if like a you're on one plan and you

21
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,661
use something that would qualify you for
a lesser plan on your next bill that's 

22
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,070
reflected,
they reimburse you for it.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,900
They,
they,

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,270
they make it so that you're paying for 
what you use.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,550
And really that is how it should be.
I mean,

26
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:25,551
it's a,
that's how every company should be the 

27
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:25,551
idea of getting locked into contracts.
It's fucking gross.

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,550
You don't have to get locked in the 
contracts and you don't have to suffer 

29
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:31,550
with shit phones either.
They have the top of the line,

30
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,560
android phones,
including the Samsung Galaxy s three,

31
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,890
which I have,
which is just a stunning phone.

32
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,440
And the Samsung Galaxy note,
Opi hasn't.

33
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:41,580
You have the s,
the s three,

34
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,770
I sure do.
It's a

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,280
combat asphalt whistle.
Earlier I was talking to him about that 

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,280
whistle that always got me embarrassed 
when

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,500
the services a gray.
A lot of people,

38
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:54,050
um,
uh,

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,730
love the sprint service in La.
I know Joey raves about,

40
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,330
he says it's great.
Um,

41
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,270
and the,
uh,

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,320
like I said,
the phones that the quality of the 

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,481
phones is top notch.
I mean they have the best phones in the 

44
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:08,510
world now if you want to like,
have like a one purpose device.

45
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,810
These,
especially the galaxy note to the new 

46
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,180
one.
I saw one today.

47
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:14,680
I,
I,

48
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,970
you know,
it's a little vague.

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,070
I've resisted getting one,
but I think I can't resist any longer.

50
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,990
I think I have to have one of those 
fucking things,

51
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,890
isn't it?
I am a Dork.

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,670
Okay.
The big heads and big hands.

53
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,530
I have a big head and normal.
I'm not going to.

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,990
Yeah,
a

55
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,210
little fit May.
Maybe.

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,390
Maybe that's what I need.
Yeah.

57
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,190
Anyway,
go do a Rogan.ting.com

58
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,050
and you can save 25 bucks and it has all
the other information.

59
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,380
This is a company though.
We've,

60
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:50,381
uh,
we've been working with them for a long 

61
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:50,381
time,
very,

62
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:52,521
very cool people and what they're trying
to do is just be involved in an ethical 

63
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,870
business and we support that.
So Rogan.ting.com.

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,990
We're also sponsored by on it.
Of course o n n it if you have never 

65
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,880
heard of it or anything,
you must be new to the podcast because a

66
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:06,270
fucking said everything I could say 
about on it.

67
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,100
Wait,
we got,

68
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,620
we got the Himalayan sea salt and the 
salt.

69
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,350
Yeah,
we just continue to,

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,320
to have cool shit that we,
uh,

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,430
we're,
we're selling people.

72
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:18,410
That's all.
We're trying to do it on it.

73
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,860
Hey,
should they get pepper?

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,430
Maybe?

75
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,640
Yeah.
Why would you wouldn't.

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,170
Have you ever heard of a place that 
sells salt and pepper?

77
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,730
Well,
not normally,

78
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:31,731
but see Himalayan sea salt known as a,
a more of like a health supplement.

79
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,570
Like people put it in their water when 
they get up in the morning,

80
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,930
find some pepper to go with it.
It's only good if you're cooking William

81
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,550
Pepper.
Pepper is only good if you're cooking.

82
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,300
I need to find out the benefits of 
Himalayan Sea salt,

83
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:49,050
but I think it was just like I said with
the killer bee.

84
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,250
Honey,
we have killer bee honey.

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,460
Why do we have killer bee honey?
Because it sounds gangster as fuck,

86
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,490
right?
It's,

87
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,730
it's bad ass to Jackson killer bees and 
take their fucking honey and that's also

88
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:02,250
bad ass to get some salt that came from 
the Himalayas.

89
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,280
I don't know why.
I don't know why it doesn't make any 

90
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,280
sense.

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,650
A lot of his fucking stupid but.
But it is a fact that Himalayan sea salt

92
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,450
sounds dope and if you have it over your
house,

93
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:13,980
chicks will think you're smarter than 
you really are.

94
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,410
You know,
if a girl comes over at some guy's house

95
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,510
and he's got some Himalayan sea salt 
laying around,

96
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,370
she might go,
well maybe he knows things.

97
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:25,371
You know,
just maybe it's just not good at 

98
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,991
communicating.
What is your fucking pepper who also 

99
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:29,990
have a force,
a hemp protein powder.

100
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,140
It's the finest quality hemp protein 
powder along with Monica and raw cocoa 

101
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,791
when it's just fucking fantastic shit 
and it's super delicious and it's also a

102
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,010
very low in sugar.
It only has one gram of sugar per 

103
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,010
serving.
It's because it's sweetened with Stevia,

104
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,900
which is a natural plant sweetener 
that's really potent.

105
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,340
You only have to use like a tiny amount 
of it.

106
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,340
It's pretty crazy shut,
but it's super delicious and nutritious.

107
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,310
And of course Alpha brain,
which is the cognitive enhancing 

108
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,520
formula.
What Alpha brain is a.

109
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,550
it's common at atory supplement.
A bunch of different nootropics and 

110
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,640
nootropics are these vitamins and 
nutrients for the.

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,900
For Your Dome Son to file your neuro 
transmitters to keep you talking.

uh,

153
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,790
my new specials available right now.
It's on Joe Rogan.net.

154
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,040
It's five bucks.
It's drm free.

155
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,200
It's just the,
the Louis C K model.

156
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,900
So I'm go get that and go fuck yourself.
Okay.

157
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,490
All right,
great.

158
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,700
Oop.
Joey or ladies,

159
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,770
you play the music and the podcast has 
come full circle experience trying to 

160
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,850
get podcasts all.

161
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,260
What happened?
He just,

162
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,550
he just died off there.
Like your,

163
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,480
your actual real voice.
The podcast has come full circle.

164
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,630
You are here.
If it was not for Opie and Anthony,

165
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,340
I doubt I would have ever thought it 
would be so fun to do a podcast.

166
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,860
What was it about us that made you want 
to do this?

167
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,830
Because you guys are the first radio 
show that I've ever done.

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,860
That is a complete hang out.
Like almost every show that I had ever 

169
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,310
done.
Even the great ones.

170
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Howard Stern,
whatever it felt like they have an 

171
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,390
agenda like the sit down and they'll ask
questions and you know,

172
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,410
they have and they're going to control 
it and they're going to move it along 

173
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,590
certain lines with you guys.
It was always just to hang out.

174
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,850
You would go there and it was just a 
real conversation.

175
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,120
Well,
uh,

176
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,070
it's,
it's just that word lazy.

177
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Yeah.
But you don't understand that all of a 

178
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:01,900
sudden the right way to do it.
But then it became our thing,

179
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,470
you know,
just to chill out and,

180
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:03,400
you know,
go for it.

181
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,460
You guys doing it that way,
inspired me to do this the same way I 

182
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,460
am.
That's so cool.

183
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,070
One hundred percent,
100 percent.

184
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,850
If it wasn't for doing your show because
every other show where someone got,

185
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,330
you know,
they got interviewed on your show.

186
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,370
You just talked.
I mean,

187
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:22,270
we could go on a show and you know,
we could just all ask anthony about guns

188
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,420
and that'd be a fascinating fucking show
and we could do it for an hour and a 

189
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,420
half,
hour and a half.

190
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,290
You know what I'm saying?
That's him getting warmed up as far as 

191
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,040
that'd be three or four hours,
but you know what I mean.

192
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,520
I mean it's like,
well,

193
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,690
the philosophy I've always had about 
radio is a philosophy about radio.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,580
Uh,
there's a lot of egos and radio.

195
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,870
Yeah.
And so they,

196
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,330
there's a lot of guys,
I don't feel like naming names today,

197
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:45,940
but a lot of guys,
they have to be the funniest guy in the,

198
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,920
in the room.
They have to be the most creative,

199
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,550
the most interesting.
And we took the tack,

200
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,590
like if you come on our show,
we're going to fucking sit back and 

201
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,191
listen to what Joe Rogan has to say 
because you come in well prepared and 

202
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:02,061
you'll do,
you blow our mind every time you come 

203
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,401
in.
But when I go home and I'm in among my 

204
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:04,401
friends and family,
they go,

205
00:09:04,401 --> 00:09:05,610
wow,
that was a really good show today.

206
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,680
I get the credit in the end.
So who gives a fuck?

207
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,670
Who the funniest guy is in the room or,
or the most interesting.

208
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,790
But a lot of radio guys never understood
that fucking concept.

209
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,790
So it goes back to your thought,
everything has to be all right for the 

210
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,731
next 15 minutes we're going to do this 
and then we're gonna move onto the 

211
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,390
interview and if you get a laugh,
I got to make sure I get a bigger laugh.

212
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,260
That's an exhausting way to do it is 
really dumb too.

213
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,290
It's like,
why would you not want other people to 

214
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,290
be funny?
Right?

215
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,830
How does that make you less funny?
Like the idea that your entire body of 

216
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,310
work that you've done up until now is 
meaningless.

217
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,770
If this other person is funnier for a 
brief moment.

218
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,660
Of course it's so stupid.
It's like,

219
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:47,661
why would you be even affected by it at 
all if someone else is doing well,

220
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,770
but the business is filled with those 
guys.

221
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,060
It's so weak.
It's comedy is as well.

222
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,660
Yeah.
And,

223
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,170
and they're scared of the unknown as far
as radio goes.

224
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:03,170
You know,
if something's going well just go with 

225
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,141
it.
But they have that stupid a clock in 

226
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:06,141
their head and they're like,
well,

227
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,130
we only allowed 20 minutes for this guy 
to be funny or interesting and we got to

228
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:11,570
move on to like news or some horse.
Yeah.

229
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I think you have to go to said,
just throw all that shit away and just 

230
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:16,580
keep going.
All right.

231
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,440
We're going to read the news at noon.
You're fucking thing that you have to do

232
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,710
15 minutes and all that.
And that bored the hell out of me when I

233
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,600
got into radio.
I mean they still do it.

234
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,180
They still do it.
I got in and I was playing music and all

235
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,260
that shit.
I'm like,

236
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,840
this is stupid.
If I can't talk and just,

237
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,010
you know,
have some kind of hang,

238
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,540
then I'm going to go and do something 
else.

239
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,290
Yeah.
Kevin.

240
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:38,070
And been a really interesting guys.
I don't know if you know them at all.

241
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,510
The guys,
of course.

242
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,260
Yeah.
Do you guys,

243
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:43,980
have you ever met one of them?
Who's the bigger guy that's been.

244
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah.
I've met Ben at k rock in New York.

245
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,270
He's really smart.
He could've been nicer,

246
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,610
really smart cats and if someone just 
like let them talk in the morning and 

247
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,550
just have people on talking and have 
guests on a talk with them,

248
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,160
should be fucking a fantastic radio 
show,

249
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,580
but they have to shove songs.
Then they just shove songs in it because

250
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:07,581
that's the new thing on regular radio.
You've got to get to music and for 

251
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:07,581
whatever reason,
I mean,

252
00:11:07,581 --> 00:11:09,040
and it's all music we've heard a million
times.

253
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,610
You're not going to blow my mind with a 
new song.

254
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:16,611
Right.
And you can be in the middle of the 

255
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:16,611
coolest fucking conversation.

256
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:17,890
They have to play a song and the PDS are
down the hall there.

257
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,520
They're watching the clock and they'll 
hotline,

258
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,000
you know,
they'll,

259
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,390
they'll come march in the studio and 
they'll,

260
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,100
they'll do this point at an imaginary 
watch like,

261
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:26,700
you know,
get back,

262
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,190
get back to the format.
So whack.

263
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,080
Hey,
am I going to get strep throat from you?

264
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,800
No,
no,

265
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:32,400
no.
He didn't.

266
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,070
He didn't.
I was only contagious for the.

267
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:38,580
First of all I'm thinking is I'm going 
to get strep throat now.

268
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,730
I was,
how do you get strep throat then you 

269
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:43,730
have to kiss somebody or something.
Uh,

270
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,310
I think it's from eating a lot of pussy.
I'm allergic to penicillin,

271
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,570
which is like the number one,
like get rid of strep things.

272
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,270
So that's why I get it so much.
You're that guy that's allergic it.

273
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,110
I'm the one

274
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,900
guy and it's so I have,
I think that's why I get it so much.

275
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:58,490
But the only thing I've been doing is 
eating pussy.

276
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,350
What?
You sound like you're doing a character.

277
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,000
He's like,
yeah,

278
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,180
if you can,
if you didn't.

279
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,060
Pithy,
like the creepiest guy.

280
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,980
Every voice to be talking to Brian has 
strep throat right now.

281
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,760
Your voice is whack.
If you took penicillin.

282
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:14,310
I need to know I get a huge rash over my
whole intensity.

283
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,360
It's pretty bad.
Rash.

284
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:16,970
I'm not like,
you can survive that,

285
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:17,850
right?
Yeah.

286
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,340
But I,
I can take z packs and that usually 

287
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,340
works.
Love the zoo.

288
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,260
Pass time.
I love my left.

289
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:28,790
Tonsil is so big that the air is gone 
from my throat.

290
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,260
Like when it tried to sleep,
it's like I'm gagging the whole night 

291
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,260
because I'm like,
I can't breathe.

292
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,290
Oh,
rapid strep throat.

293
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,900
Think so it's not fun.
Oh,

294
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,320
this place is set up up to

295
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,400
Kinda intimidating,
intimidating.

296
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:45,590
Wait till we put the Werewolf in.
What's the world?

297
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,360
Will get a wearable.
There's a guy named.

298
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,100
Pat Mcgee is a special effects guy.
He's recreating the American Werewolf,

299
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,130
right?
You know,

300
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:54,380
uh,
American Werewolf in London.

301
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:59,381
They do a full size version of it.
And how bad ass is that kind of jealous.

302
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,480
We got just a shitty studio in New York 
that we can't do much with.

303
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,840
Well,
that's the beautiful thing about not 

304
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:10,840
having a boss,
you know,

305
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,490
to whatever we want.
We just set,

306
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,460
just done a little of that just a little
while.

307
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,690
You guys can,
you know,

308
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,610
you guys have been saddled down by 
bosses forever if you guys,

309
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,570
uh,
not really.

310
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,020
Never.
Now we've never listened to him.

311
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,130
Yeah,
that's true.

312
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,970
That's caused a lot of strife over the 
years.

313
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:30,860
But the fact that there's even any 
strife,

314
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,920
you know,
they should just leave you the fuck 

315
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:35,920
alone.

316
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,870
They should let you do whatever you want
to do and you're going to do it the 

317
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,091
right way.
You're trying to do a good show as much 

318
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:40,091
as we complain.
I mean,

319
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:40,190
we're allowed to do whatever the fuck we
want,

320
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,020
but what about.
What about this is ideal you have?

321
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,130
You don't listen to anybody?
No,

322
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,670
not no one is on your back.
This is the one there.

323
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:52,050
This is the whole operation.
Get it.

324
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,220
The whole operation.
Yeah.

325
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,030
Yeah.
We do whatever we want.

326
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:56,790
That's cool.
Yeah.

327
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,930
I mean there's a lot of shit that I'm 
sure we would've gotten in trouble for 

328
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:01,930
it.
We had to listen to somebody.

329
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,880
What do you think is stupid?
What is your number one thing you would 

330
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:06,880
have gotten in trouble for?
If it was on regular radio?

331
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,500
You of the word cunt.
Oh,

332
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,760
language crap.
Yeah.

333
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,580
Yeah,
but satellite.

334
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,090
You can tell a lot of.
I'm sure a lot of corporate stuff,

335
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,220
but you guys know about corporations 
drugs.

336
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,260
You wouldn't last a couple of sponsors,
but did you do any bits that would have 

337
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,260
gotten you in trouble?
We don't really do.

338
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,220
Bits are going away.
Yeah,

339
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,370
we just,
I mean I would rather just have 

340
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:29,370
conversations with interesting people 
like it,

341
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,470
but then,
but every now and then someone will do a

342
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:31,490
bit.
That's fucking great.

343
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:36,491
I mean,
I'm not opposed to anybody creating 

344
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,150
anything that's funny just for us to do 
it.

345
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,610
So much to talk about.
Hope the world is fucking banana and I 

346
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:42,860
do have to say this.
You're the king of twitter,

347
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,610
the King of twitter ads.
You are the king of twitter has to be 

348
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,040
said.
You're the lengths you tweet or just 

349
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,990
amazing.
Oh well get them to me.

350
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,910
You know,
most of your search that out.

351
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Yeah.
Well maybe some of it is a things I 

352
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,140
retweet.
Some of it is things Sunday,

353
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,440
whatever I could put,
but you're filtering it from,

354
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,080
you know,
you're filtering the shit you're,

355
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,910
you're finding and then sending it out 
to your people,

356
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,870
but there's never been a time where you 
get so much weird shit thrown at you all

357
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,470
day and you can throw it right back at 
everybody.

358
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,610
And you were the one that started the 
whole planet thing.

359
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,410
Where earth is this.
Yeah.

360
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,470
And then it shows this and it just gets 
bigger and bigger and just blows your 

361
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:23,690
mind.
Now the thing is everywhere.

362
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,220
But you were the first one to tweet 
that.

363
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,900
Oh really?
Well,

364
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:28,980
it was just knowing how fucking big shit
is.

365
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,390
Loved that video.
That video is so fascinating.

366
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,940
Do you love it though?
It doesn't creep you out.

367
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,780
Yeah,
definitely.

368
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:36,560
Definitely does.

369
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
We had a neil degrasse Tyson Tyson on 
the other day,

370
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,330
the astrophysicist.
Sure.

371
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
He was talking to us about.
Oh my God,

372
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,190
he was talking to us about the depth of 
the universe and it just,

373
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,840
the way he does it,
first of all,

374
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:50,930
he's so brilliant and passionate and 
when he describes things,

375
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,170
it's just so like there's like a theater
to it as well,

376
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,210
you know,
because he's such a good talker and he's

377
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:01,211
also so fucking smart.
So when he's talking about the 

378
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,551
multiverse and the idea that the 
universe with hundreds of billions of 

379
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:03,920
galaxies,
like almost infinite,

380
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,730
is really just one of an infinite number
of universes and he likes,

381
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,190
it just freaks.
It can freak you the fuck out and you're

382
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:18,191
one of these guys.
You're convinces his life all over the 

383
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:18,191
fucking place.
Right?

384
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,010
I don't see how weak,
you know,

385
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,070
I think they've done calculations on not
just like everything in the world is a 

386
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,070
collection of Adam's essentially.

387
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,060
Right.
And I think if you understand what it is

388
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,610
that's your,
uh,

389
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,620
your Dorsal,
I think they understand that if the 

390
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,651
universe is large enough that every 
collection of atoms in exactly the same 

391
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,760
collection as it is on earth will exist 
somewhere else that when you're talking 

392
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,180
about something that's infinite,
like literally everything that exists in

393
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:58,181
the exact same order and the exact 
objects in the exact place exist in some

394
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:03,200
place,
but it has to be some insane light years

395
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,100
away.
Like 14 trillion,

396
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:06,260
trillion,
trillion trillion.

397
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,850
There was a into the wormhole with uh,
what's,

398
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,440
what's his name guys banging his 
granddaughter,

399
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,290
Morgan Freeman,
Morgan Freeman.

400
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,330
And he's the host of this.
And it's just like.

401
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,330
So there's another ope.
It just,

402
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:22,640
you have to go far enough if that's what
infinity means.

403
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,250
It's so crazy that not only is there 
another ope,

404
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,430
but there's another jamie in the room,
there's another Brian.

405
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,890
The room is another me and I wrote like,
that is real,

406
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,920
but what kind of life you think is out 
there is that I think we're out exactly 

407
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,020
how we're living on earth or it or is it
earth?

408
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,280
Uh,
5,000

409
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:45,281
years ago,
the universe infinite is so crazy that 

410
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:49,151
the earth in exactly the order that it 
appears here might be somewhere else 

411
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:54,010
because it's just a combination of Adams
and various states and that combination 

412
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,240
of animes in various states could 
absolutely mirror in the infinite,

413
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,160
but we have to think about what the 
infinite means,

414
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,440
what the with the infinite is.
It's impossible for us to conceptualize 

415
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,220
that freak you out as a kid when you 
started thinking about the universe and 

416
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,790
then you were okay with the fact that,
wait,

417
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:11,610
maybe it ends and there's a wall.
This is how I thought of it.

418
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm like,
okay.

419
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,120
The bar says,
and there's a wall,

420
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,090
but then I started thinking,
what the fuck's on the other side of the

421
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:23,091
wall?
I remember being a little kid and just 

422
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:23,160
stopping and thinking for a second that 
there's not a roof,

423
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,610
there's not a roof to the world.
Wow.

424
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,710
You know,
there's just kind of flying through 

425
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,871
space and all of a sudden my law,
my world went like from my point of view

426
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,940
to be in this is my neighborhood,
this is where I lived,

427
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,960
to what the fuck?
Like how come nobody's talking about 

428
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:40,960
that?
It was,

429
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,110
it was really weird to be like a seven 
or an eight year old,

430
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:44,910
whatever it was when I really started 
about eight.

431
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I think it happens a around a for 
everyone because that's about the time 

432
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,270
you realize you're going to die your 
life.

433
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,290
Far too scary day.
I remember I learned at eight that you 

434
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,950
were going to die and my parents were 
taken off to go to the movies.

435
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I just want to suck on.
My Mom's was so fucking scared and to 

436
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,860
them it was just a night out to me.
It was like a life changer.

437
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:08,610
I'm like,
wait a minute,

438
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:11,310
this fucking thing in day.
Yeah.

439
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,440
It was a weird,
weird night.

440
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:18,441
I cried the first night,
I realized that I was going to die 

441
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:19,170
someday,
like six or something like that.

442
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:24,171
I cried.
I was really sad and that was also when 

443
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:24,171
I was,
I,

444
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:25,830
I'd already given up on religion because
I did a year in Catholic school.

445
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,710
Are you a Catholic guy originally?
Yeah,

446
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,240
I did one year in Catholic school.
I was like,

447
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,320
yeah,
nope.

448
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,090
I'm telling my parents had run away from
home.

449
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,340
Was it?
I'm not going.

450
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,120
Was it all boys school?
No,

451
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:41,121
it was separate to separate us in class,
but there was girls that it would have 

452
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:41,910
other classes.
I was,

453
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,650
I was brought up Catholic,
but I'm not a,

454
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,510
I'm not an organized religion guy.

455
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,790
The craziest girl I ever dated was,
went to an all girls Catholic school.

456
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,490
Yeah.
What do you believe in then?

457
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,300
Um,
I don't really believe in anything.

458
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,370
I mean,
I don't not believe in anything either.

459
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,290
That's the problem.
Are you an atheist?

460
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,060
No,
I wouldn't say I'm an atheist.

461
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,980
There's something right now we just 
haven't.

462
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:06,981
I don't know.
I'm definitely not throw out the 

463
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:10,101
possibility that there's something,
I think to throw out the possibility 

464
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:10,590
that there's something out there is kind
of silly.

465
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I think this,
a lot of the reaction that people do 

466
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,340
that is the reaction against organized 
religion and organized religion.

467
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,520
We all know is silly.
So your reaction is to say no.

468
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:22,020
There's no god.
There's no anything,

469
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,400
there's no evidence.
I,

470
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:27,660
I respectfully leave open the 
possibility for almost anything.

471
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,120
But do you.
You said we all know,

472
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,780
we all know what the religion is 
organized religion.

473
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,080
You're listening to this show and you,
you feel me on this dog.

474
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm telling you know,
and I know that it's a crock of shit,

475
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,650
but that was,
that's interesting.

476
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:48,651
I want to go with that for a second.
Are you talking to the people out there 

477
00:20:48,651 --> 00:20:49,270
that go to church every Sunday?
They even know?

478
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,160
Or are you talking about the people that
have given up on,

479
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,330
on organized religion?
If you're really paying attention,

480
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,170
you know,
Tore Shit.

481
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,480
If you're really paying attention and if
you're not paying attention,

482
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,420
that's on you,
right?

483
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,470
You don't have.
People just don't want to admit that I 

484
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,300
don't want it to themselves.
It doesn't mean that there's no god is 

485
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,490
the idea that there's no god,
it's crazy,

486
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:10,990
but the real problem was the idea that 
all those contradictory things,

487
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:15,991
all those ridiculous things that are 
written down on paper about controlling 

488
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:20,770
property and about wearing types of 
cloth,

489
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:25,771
at the same time,
things need to be put to death for like 

490
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:28,951
if you really knew what the fuck was in 
the Bible and you really got a good 

491
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,280
account of it and excellent translation 
of all of it together,

492
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:31,630
which is really fucking difficult,
right?

493
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,400
You would go,
this is crazy.

494
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,900
People talk,
okay,

495
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,390
this is not God telling you all this 
shit.

496
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,540
There may be a god and maybe God has a 
way of communicating to you through good

497
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:46,930
and bad feelings,
good and bad reactions to people,

498
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,931
and maybe that's what God's message 
truly is and that's people have sort of 

499
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,710
learned lessons from these things and 
written them down.

500
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,860
It doesn't discount the idea that there 
might be some overwhelming force in the 

501
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,631
universe that creates all of this.
The idea that we should discount that 

502
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:04,630
entirely.
I think it's kind of nuts.

503
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,990
I think the problem is that it's been 
simplified to this nonsense sort of 

504
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,390
cartoonish,
you know,

505
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:14,110
man and a robe and gods and then his son
Jesus came down.

506
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,350
I think that that's what fucks it up for
the real idea because the real idea is 

507
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,560
not that far fetched.

508
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,720
Well how do we update that?
Well,

509
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,780
yeah,
that's a good thing because the Bible 

510
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:27,780
was written what,
600 years after the fact.

511
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,420
The real problem is pussy.
Okay,

512
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,530
let me just break it down.
The real problem is pussy because what 

513
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,060
happens is someone has a new way of 
thinking.

514
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Someone has a new way of doing it.
Someone comes up with a new Bible and 

515
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,411
they put it all together and then they 
start teaching that shit and then they 

516
00:22:46,411 --> 00:22:48,790
start banging chicks and then everybody 
gets pissed off and then everybody wants

517
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:53,791
to come in Waco style with guns and 
you're not going to be able to update 

518
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:58,021
it.
One of the things about religion is it 

519
00:22:58,021 --> 00:22:58,021
has to be old as fuck.
If it's not oldest,

520
00:22:58,021 --> 00:22:58,570
fuck,
we're getting there.

521
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,490
We're not going to trust you,
but there was a time.

522
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,080
Catholicism wasn't old as fuck.

523
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,630
Yeah.
Was there one time it was as new as 

524
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:07,660
scientology.
When was that?

525
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:12,661
When was it created?
Was it created all at once or did it 

526
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:13,170
absorb other religions?
I don't.

527
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:15,220
I don't know.
The history of says I have no idea.

528
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,590
It just always was.
I wasn't paying attention.

529
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,920
What a country religion to grow up as a 
Catholic was just fucking just torturous

530
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,650
and then and then the other religions 
you gotta blow off as not being real.

531
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,360
Well,
everyone's full of shit.

532
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,350
Crazy.
That's the reality is that the absolute 

533
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,561
hardcore reality is that we're just 
studying some things that people wrote 

534
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:42,090
and the idea that any of that stuff is a
message from God and then he's not 

535
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,430
communicating with you today in some 
way,

536
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:44,320
shape or form.
It's crazy.

537
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,880
You know?
I think that most of what people wrote 

538
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:49,910
about,
most likely the origins of it,

539
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,940
the real big experiences that we wrote 
about were either bullshit or would 

540
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,490
probably psychedelic experiences.

541
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,590
I think they were eating a lot of 
mushrooms back then.

542
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:02,591
The shit grew everywhere and they knew 
the ones you could eat and the ones you 

543
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:03,200
couldn't because it kept you alive.
You've talked about that on our show.

544
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:03,850
Yeah.
And,

545
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,750
and you look at the old,
uh,

546
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,490
what drawings and the drawings and 
stuff,

547
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,830
and you see the fucking magic mushrooms.
All magic mushrooms,

548
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,880
first of all,
all over Christmas Lore,

549
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,940
all over depictions of Christmas is the,
to Mascara mushroom.

550
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,080
I mean you see little elves with like 
dancing around these mushrooms.

551
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,980
So the thing about that mushroom is 
apparently it was very variable,

552
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:33,130
like you could get ahold of some event 
and it doesn't do shit for you and then 

553
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,281
you can get a hold of some other stuff 
that gives you the psychedelic 

554
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:36,890
experience.
And it might be seasonal,

555
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:39,770
it might be geographical,
it might vary in genetics.

556
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,980
So it's a tricky mushroom,
but those are a lot of evidence that 

557
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,101
points to the root of a lot of these 
religious things having to do with 

558
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:52,290
mushrooms and the use of psychedelic.
So why do they write about that one?

559
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,140
Because it's first of all,
find a deep on,

560
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,260
you could find it on the internet 
somewhere deep,

561
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,660
but there have been people that have 
written things about it,

562
00:24:59,661 --> 00:25:03,080
but it's not something that makes people
excited.

563
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,500
The,
uh,

564
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,530
the idea of psychedelics being anything 
other than a distraction and you know,

565
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,440
something bad for your life,
you know,

566
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,600
like when you think about,
like someone says,

567
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:12,860
oh,
he does psychedelics.

568
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,280
What does that mean to me?
It was,

569
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,230
it was to me,
you know,

570
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:17,840
automatically think hunter s Thompson,
he's losing his mind,

571
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,490
firing his gun at the walls.
You know,

572
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:21,590
that that sort of vision pops into mind.

573
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,000
Are you heading that way?
No,

574
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,120
that's crazy.
But if you,

575
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,910
if you said arguing the hunter s Thomas 
of our time,

576
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,520
I heart,
that's ridiculous.

577
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:32,500
You're getting there.
And he was a genius.

578
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,960
He was a,
he was an alcoholic too.

579
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,180
I mean at the end it was really,
I'm a huge fan and the end of his life 

580
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,370
is very sad.
I was listening to your uh,

581
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,900
yeah.
It was like almost he couldn't even 

582
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,900
understand them.
Yeah.

583
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:46,960
He was just rambling and told.
Yeah,

584
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,970
I know you're not a big alcohol guy.
No,

585
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,900
because I'd listened to the Joe Rogan 
podcast.

586
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,880
Who did you have on one of our.
Oh,

587
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:54,110
dom rare.
Powerful dot.

588
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,330
Yeah.
That was a cool plan partner.

589
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,220
I know and I found it fascinating that 
you used to hang out at that pool joint.

590
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,350
Which one?
The north north of the city.

591
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,650
Chelsea.
Chelsea bulliers weren't in white 

592
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:08,650
plains.

593
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:13,090
Yeah.
Executive leaders and wife was a great 

594
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,090
podcast to a thanks.
Yeah,

595
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,540
totally.
The old stories of the old pool hall.

596
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:19,750
Yeah.
That's just one of the last fun places 

597
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,300
where a man could be a man in this 
country.

598
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,310
You know,
there's something about pool halls,

599
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:27,311
like a lot of people like they look down
on it or they have a negative 

600
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:30,941
connotation with it because a lot of 
times pool is thought of as like this 

601
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:31,730
kind of tough person game or some,
you know,

602
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,230
you're going to be around like seedy 
characters and.

603
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,550
But I've had some of the best times of 
my life and pool halls.

604
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,600
Are you good?
Yeah,

605
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:40,010
I'm pretty good.
Real good.

606
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,780
Came in second place in the tournament 
last night.

607
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,100
Oh,
you're still playing well.

608
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,210
Damn.
Yeah.

609
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,390
I played in Toronto.
Still like it.

610
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

611
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,790
I just started playing in a tournament 
again.

612
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,530
But yeah,
I love playing.

613
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,300
I played,
I played a lot of money.

614
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,300
No,
no,

615
00:26:52,301 --> 00:26:57,301
no.
I mean if I'm with somebody I would 

616
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:00,261
gamble like a for the pay for the time 
or something like that or play for like 

617
00:27:00,261 --> 00:27:04,101
20 bucks or something like that.
I not really interested in stealing the 

618
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:04,101
money,
but I'm just interested in,

619
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:09,041
uh,
I just liked the game was just like 

620
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:09,041
playing the game.
I like competing.

621
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:09,041
Why?
Why do you like that game?

622
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:13,610
Because it's a control game.
The game is all about focusing in 

623
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,321
exactly on the amount of effort that you
have to use with your hand to make a 

624
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:21,480
ball roll certain amount of revolutions 
and there's times where literally you're

625
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:26,481
looking for the position to be,
to vary between one and maybe a half a 

626
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:27,210
revolution.
So you're,

627
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:32,211
you're looking to get that close and 
you're doing this all striking a ball 

628
00:27:32,211 --> 00:27:32,340
with another ball.

629
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,940
Now when I play,
I just want to try to hit that mark.

630
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,560
Have you ever seen anybody that's really
good?

631
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,520
Well,
yeah,

632
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,680
like really,
really good money.

633
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,290
SPN Yeah,
in real life,

634
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,470
but there's like an art.
What's her name?

635
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,870
Oh,
genetically she's very good.

636
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,110
She's good to look at.
There's there's guys that you watched 

637
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,420
them play and it's like you're watching 
an art form.

638
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:56,510
It's like,
I think that blows your mind when you 

639
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:56,510
see that.
I think that's the case with anything.

640
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,920
I think if you understand chess,
I think that the chest is like that.

641
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,080
I think the people that really 
understand shit.

642
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:06,081
I mean I understand chest,
but not enough to like read like the 

643
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:06,110
Rook Knight to seven and all that shit.
I don't,

644
00:28:06,111 --> 00:28:09,450
I don't really know it that way.
I just know which pieces go in what way,

645
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,480
but I know that peace to people that 
love games,

646
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,390
they'll sit and watch a guy play and 
they get an uber.

647
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,130
Ah.
When they see a good move,

648
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:19,250
like,
oh fuck yeah,

649
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,050
fuck.
Just it.

650
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,370
Just jacked him with that shit and that 
you know that that comes from knowing 

651
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,630
that that form of competition.
I,

652
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,780
I used to like playing chess,
I was pretty good growing up.

653
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,670
And then when you realize you have to 
think 10,

654
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,780
12 fucking moves ahead.
It's a lot of work done,

655
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:42,290
a lot of work to think to think about 
all these different things that could 

656
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,321
possibly happen and to calculate what's 
the risk and the reward and the factor 

657
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,800
in how your opponent plays and what's 
your.

658
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,350
What's your deal with alcohol?
What,

659
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:52,320
why don't you like it as much as the 
other stuff you've talked about?

660
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,040
Oh,
it's fun.

661
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:54,480
It's just bad for your body.
You know,

662
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,730
like still.
I still drank.

663
00:28:56,731 --> 00:29:01,731
I mean I'll help.
I'll have a couple of cocktails on 

664
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:01,731
occasion,
on occasion,

665
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:02,020
but the problem is like get hammered.

666
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,050
Then the next day you feel like fucking 
shit,

667
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,420
but if you smoke pot you don't feel bad 
at all.

668
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,010
You know?
Alcohol does a lot of great things.

669
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,580
It,
it,

670
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:16,581
it enables people to laugh when they 
maybe wouldn't have a lot more fucking 

671
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:18,810
high five and a lot more craziness.
This could be great.

672
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,780
Loosens people up.
Yeah.

673
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,010
Loosens people up.
It's great for comedy clubs,

674
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:28,011
man.
Like you could tell like evenings a 

675
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:28,011
week,
nights at the Improv,

676
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:30,090
like one of the things about the Improv 
during the week,

677
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,710
uh,
the shows are great.

678
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,770
They're very realistic.
Like the crowds do not give you any more

679
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:35,860
than you deserve.
If you're,

680
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,080
you're,
you're killing.

681
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,120
They'll laugh really hard.
Sure.

682
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,460
But you gotta be on point.
They're not going to just give it to 

683
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,460
you.
Yeah.

684
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,460
They're not drinking.
You look around,

685
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:43,460
you'll see like,
ah,

686
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,100
sodas and shit.
You know,

687
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,890
I just got a text from Jamie from the 
Improv by the.

688
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,380
Well I flew in.
You mean the laugh factory?

689
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,450
Oh,
he's left factor by the.

690
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:57,451
I'm not the Improv.
This other club on the other side of 

691
00:29:57,451 --> 00:30:00,511
town,
but he writes opioid ladies and 

692
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:00,511
gentlemen.
Sorry.

693
00:30:00,511 --> 00:30:01,540
Lost my phone.
You are welcome to come anytime.

694
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,240
I wrote him two nights ago when I come 
to town,

695
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,980
like going to the comedy store or you 
know,

696
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,510
any of the places.
That's where we first met.

697
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,690
Yes.
Yeah.

698
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:13,630
We first met before ever.
Did you show?

699
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:18,631
We met at the comments,
you don't always ask me why I love Joe 

700
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:21,130
Rogan so much and uh,
when we were going through our shit for 

701
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,240
the sex and the church thing,
you like stepped out and wrote a fucking

702
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:26,140
article on the whole damn thing 
supporting us.

703
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah,
I was,

704
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:30,850
I was horrified that no one was getting 
upset that you guys were getting.

705
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,320
Oh,
everyone was getting upset.

706
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,850
But I mean,
you know what I mean.

707
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,990
It wasn't like,
it wasn't like a national free speech.

708
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
Outraged man.
You wrote a great article and that's 

709
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,290
when I started really realizing,
you know what you're all about,

710
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,300
you know,
because I knew it for fear factory.

711
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:48,550
I didn't even know that you're a standup
at that.

712
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,910
At that time we didn't know each other.
And then when I saw your standup I was 

713
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,370
absolutely blown away because,
you know,

714
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,100
you leave thinking about shit.
I liked that.

715
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,040
I liked that from a standup,
but I'm full time.

716
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,210
What was going to say?
Oh,

717
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,570
um,
there was no outrage because we didn't 

718
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,630
have the social networking like our fan 
base was.

719
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,720
They were out of their minds.
Like what do you mean you guys are 

720
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:12,720
getting kicked off the air,
but there was no twitter back then.

721
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:12,720
There was nothing.

722
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,700
So it's kind of like,
I guess we've said on our show a bunch 

723
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:17,700
of times,
you know,

724
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,420
you hit your kick it and hill and all 
the ants go fucking scurrying,

725
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,500
but they don't know what the fuck to do 
that.

726
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,980
That was our fan base.
They're all pissed off.

727
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,150
They were running,
you know,

728
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,960
all sorts of directions,
but they,

729
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,610
they couldn't organize.
Nowadays you can organize obviously.

730
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,640
I thought it was the most ridiculous 
shit ever.

731
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:37,810
The people were making a great outrage 
about the fact that someone had sex in a

732
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:41,790
church that it's like you did something 
so horrible,

733
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,910
man.
They did something that everybody wants 

734
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:46,910
to do,
but they didn't.

735
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,910
The super secret special place.
And when Magic House,

736
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,830
why's it bad?
They're not bad.

737
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:51,610
They're,
it's stupid.

738
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:53,770
Why would it be worse if someone fucked 
in a supermarket?

739
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,210
That was my point.
It would be,

740
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,690
I would think would be worse with 
someone at a toys r us.

741
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:57,970
Yeah.
No,

742
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:02,971
I get your point,
but what would be the answer to why is 

743
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:02,971
it bad in the church?
Is that disrespectful?

744
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,960
It's a magic house.
That's what they're saying.

745
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,550
You know what I'm saying?
That magic is real.

746
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,630
And then all this fucking corny bullshit
that's obviously not real,

747
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,900
you know,
really look these people with their 

748
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,671
stain glasses and there's a dude is 
being tortured to death and he's 

749
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:21,650
supposed to stare at that and feel bad.
And I was in the vestibule anyway so I 

750
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,720
don't even think it was in the actual 
church and to this day I don't even know

751
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:27,100
if they actually did it cost me two and 
a half years of my career.

752
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,610
And you were one of the groups.
I mean literally one of the only guys 

753
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:32,610
stepping forward.
It was so gross.

754
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:37,171
I couldn't believe it was real.
I couldn't believe you guys are getting 

755
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:37,171
fired for that and I just,
I just like,

756
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:37,480
this is the craziest thing I've ever 
heard.

757
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:40,040
Like if we don't stand up and say this 
is nothing,

758
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,040
this is not that big a deal,
why are you making a big deal out of it?

759
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,860
Not only that,
it's,

760
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,810
it's,
it's funny.

761
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,390
It is funny,
you know that if they,

762
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:49,850
if they did it anywhere else,
would you have gotten in trouble?

763
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:54,851
That's the real question.
They did it a lot of other places that 

764
00:32:54,851 --> 00:32:54,851
day,
but that didn't get you in trouble.

765
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,900
They don't even talk about the church 
that got you in trouble.

766
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,810
So that's really saying that there's 
like a public policy.

767
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,270
Well,
the magic place Israel.

768
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:06,980
Well here's the thing,
the same day it was done in a toys r us.

769
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,710
That's right.
Yeah,

770
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,930
that's right.
Is Right about that.

771
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,780
So it was a toy store and the church 
were the two biggies that day,

772
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,890
but they didn't care about the fact that
they did Schwartz,

773
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:21,110
one of those,
I think it might've been Fao Schwarz,

774
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:26,770
the fact that that the reinforcing the 
idea that this magic place is actually a

775
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:27,380
magic place.

776
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

777
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:33,251
It's really kind of creepy that people 
go there and they'd want to worship and 

778
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:34,640
then want to be like,
you know,

779
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:38,390
so like if they interrupted and certain 
[inaudible] and a bunch of people and in

780
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,370
front of a bunch of people,
but if no one knows about it,

781
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,470
they actually pulled it off and I didn't
get caught.

782
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:43,030
Right.
No.

783
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,410
See,
no.

784
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,110
There was a security guard that saw it 
and actually he basically said,

785
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,760
get the hell out of here.
I don't want to deal with this shit.

786
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,530
And then someone grandstand of that day 
and you know,

787
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:58,750
it got.
So the only person that saw it was a 

788
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,750
security guard.
That was it.

789
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,750
We were,
we were done.

790
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,011
We were good.
He saw and he didn't want to deal with 

791
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:03,011
it.
He didn't want to write it up.

792
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:04,610
He didn't want to call anyone and then 
someone grand standard.

793
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,260
And then the guy basically it was like,
all right,

794
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,520
fine,
if this is what you want.

795
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:09,890
And then next thing you know,
the cops got called wow.

796
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,980
It was so real.
We had a chance that we would have got 

797
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:14,980
away with it and then we would have went
to our bosses like that,

798
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,690
man.
Then I,

799
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,500
we're just making belief.
It's just so silly.

800
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,820
But that fucked us up,
man.

801
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:21,020
We've,
we've never come back from.

802
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:25,070
That was so fucking big.
Yeah.

803
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,490
You guys were gigantic.
Fuck.

804
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,940
And then the world changed by the time 
we got back.

805
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,800
Yeah.
Two and a half fucking years.

806
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,690
Two and a half years.
Isn't it funny that,

807
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,880
you know,
people get addicted to other shows.

808
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,230
They just like,
whoa.

809
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,660
They lock onto a show and then they just
get a.

810
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,690
They get into it.
If you take it away from them for a 

811
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:43,690
couple of years,
things changed.

812
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:43,690
Well,
they came back,

813
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:43,870
but I mean,
you know,

814
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,470
then we're competing with everything 
else.

815
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,020
Yeah.
You know,

816
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,000
to this.
Now look,

817
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,130
everyone's podcasting,
everyone's on their phones,

818
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:54,150
you know,
now you're competing with some idiot 

819
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:54,150
that just wants to look at tweets all 
day.

820
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,001
So I try to get their attachment.
Could you have done podcasting at that 

821
00:34:58,001 --> 00:34:59,420
point existed?
No.

822
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:00,650
Nothing?
No.

823
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:02,630
There was nothing to do.
We had a wait.

824
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,330
They actually paid up and pee.
You Go pee.

825
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,410
Yeah.
But do you love doing this?

826
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,000
Yeah.
You know,

827
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,040
someone took this away from you for two 
and a half years or the UFC for two and 

828
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,920
a half years,
but they were paying you.

829
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,920
Would you be cool with that Joe Rogan?
No,

830
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,140
I'd be sad.
And plus the fact that I,

831
00:35:20,141 --> 00:35:22,880
I knew that another company would hire 
us,

832
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,940
you know,
uh,

833
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,210
immediately to continue where we were.

834
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,860
Yeah.
You would have immediately gotten.

835
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:29,390
But our company said,
fuck that.

836
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:32,780
We're paying every single dollar,
but you can't do nothing.

837
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,590
That's so gross.
What a Shitty fucking company policy.

838
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,210
So I tried to get out of my contract at 
the time,

839
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:43,000
but my agent was a little scared because
he was getting his piece.

840
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,090
He was getting his taste.
So I'm like,

841
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,160
oh,
we'll get this whole fucking thing back 

842
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,160
together.
Oh,

843
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,960
that's so yucky.
That's a contract.

844
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,390
Conflict of interest isn't.
I mean we're making,

845
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,310
doing something that we're making good 
money.

846
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:58,350
And he was getting his 10 percent.
Yeah,

847
00:35:58,351 --> 00:35:59,630
that's a conflict.
Why would,

848
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,130
why would he call the company and go,
Hey,

849
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,840
you know,
my boys went out,

850
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,150
but I'd call them like weekly.
I'm like,

851
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:11,151
get the fuck out of this contract.
Because at the time clear chow was the 

852
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:12,630
big radio company.
They want us immediately,

853
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,330
they wanted to put us on a q and a for 
New York.

854
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,030
So what,
what,

855
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,570
you know,
what did they want money to get a payoff

856
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,610
to get you out of the contract?
Did they or would you have had to just 

857
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,070
take a chance?
I had sued.

858
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,320
I um,
wait,

859
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,910
what was that again?
Because I had a flip there.

860
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,520
Oh,
it was.

861
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,080
I said why would they want money?
Like it was the company that don't.

862
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,970
Who owns you guys?
It was CBS,

863
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,050
CBS,
xfinity product.

864
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,140
They have accepted money to get out of 
that,

865
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,210
you know,
that,

866
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,730
you know.
So how could you say people get to say 

867
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,401
you're full of Shit,
but I know it says I know this to be 

868
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:52,101
true.
They didn't want us to compete with 

869
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:52,101
Howard.
Uh,

870
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:52,101
because they knew we'd go across the 
street,

871
00:36:52,101 --> 00:36:54,210
do mornings.
Would we beat Howard stern warnings?

872
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,760
I don't know,
I would like to think we'd have a pretty

873
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:58,860
good shot at back then especially.

874
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,650
And uh,
they were killing it.

875
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,710
We worked in this fucking huge and,
and afternoons they knew at the very 

876
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:07,020
least we're going to take a,
you know,

877
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,920
a nice chunk of his audience away and 
that,

878
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:13,970
that was a lot of money to the company.
So they sat down in a board room and 

879
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:13,970
they said,
look,

880
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,160
it's better that we pay these fucking 
guys for two and a half years instead of

881
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:19,710
taking the chance them going up against 
our main guy.

882
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,900
That is a fact.
Well,

883
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:23,150
if that's the case,
you know,

884
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,190
if they probably looked at their own 
profits and how much it would cost to 

885
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,831
pay you off,
they probably figured it was worth the 

886
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:30,831
gamble.
Oh No.

887
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:31,170
They made everything.
They made way more money us.

888
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,840
That's how weird.
That's how fucked up the business was so

889
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:37,230
strained as they used to.
They used to talk about it.

890
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,480
It was a business where,
you know,

891
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,530
where you just printed up money.
They just printed up money and what the 

892
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,220
advertisers were.
We're just paying a fucking lot of money

893
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:52,221
for their ads.
How much has the radio business changed 

894
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:52,221
since the Internet?
Uh,

895
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:53,100
drastically.
Massively,

896
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:53,750
right?
Yeah.

897
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,770
They're stupid because at,
at the time you need personality driven 

898
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:58,770
radio.
They,

899
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,960
they said fuck that.
So the two biggest formats on regular 

900
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,680
radio is sports talk,
which anyone could do.

901
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,540
No offense those guys.
But you know,

902
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,120
that stuff is easy to study and then 
it's a pop music.

903
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,570
That's it.
No talk shows are left.

904
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,510
Really?
Yeah.

905
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:13,740
It's hard.
You were saying earlier,

906
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,470
Kevin being they have to,
they have to play their music now too.

907
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,670
I think they've always done it that way.
You think?

908
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,970
Thanks.
I feel like I remember a time where they

909
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:24,030
were street talk show,
but you know,

910
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,650
they're,
they're good dudes.

911
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:30,830
I,
I just think that the future is not 

912
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,560
looking good for like regular radio 
company.

913
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,770
Their model that they operated under.
It's just really deteriorated.

914
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,370
Right?
There's too many options

915
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,960
and we'll like stitcher and your car.
You could listen to this podcast anytime

916
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:42,590
you won your car.
Just set that up and bang.

917
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,850
Yeah.
You download them and put it on your 

918
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:47,850
phone.
You can get them all off itunes.

919
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,580
I got it right here.
So easy to do.

920
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,640
I got it right here.
It's really hard for a radio station to 

921
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,161
compete that,
especially if they have the wacky dj 

922
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,591
voice.
You guys are one of the first to shit 

923
00:38:58,591 --> 00:39:00,550
all over the place.
You really made it obvious,

924
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,010
you know,
and then there was obvious to everyone.

925
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,290
It is obvious to everyone,
but nobody brings it up.

926
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,140
One of my favorite bits we do every year
is that Jack Tobar bit.

927
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:09,010
Yeah.
I love that.

928
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,630
So many radio shows are so fucking 
pissed off at us,

929
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,930
but it's like you look at yourselves,
we're actually trying to help you out.

930
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,690
Why are you still doing that type of 
radio?

931
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,730
October.
So October.

932
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,340
We just,
uh,

933
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,260
we feature one show every day for the 
month of October.

934
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,900
Just beat the shit out of them,
but they're all doing the same thing.

935
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:29,420
You know,
there's,

936
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,870
there's shows that they have to have a 
woman,

937
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:35,590
which we call the whole obviously,
but that's a DM program director.

938
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:38,080
They get like,
they would get like youtube together,

939
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:43,081
right.
And then they would throw a woman and 

940
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:43,081
for her point of view,
yeah,

941
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,150
I'm not really interested.
Course,

942
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,480
it's not that I'm a misogynist,
but I am a man talking to men and they 

943
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,540
have a to women too.
They have a tendency to fucking put up 

944
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:57,580
the yield sign or the stop sign like,
Oh,

945
00:39:57,581 --> 00:39:58,630
you know,
knock it off.

946
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,710
So yeah,
I mean we've been.

947
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:03,700
So we've been offered females over the 
years and we just said,

948
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,130
hell fucking no.

949
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,110
I mean we'll have females on our show to
do well,

950
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:09,400
you know,
they do really well.

951
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,690
They could,
they could hold their own,

952
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:13,060
but to have someone in there on a 
regular basis,

953
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,590
oh,
that would be a fucking nightmare.

954
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,950
I mean,
you'd have to have the perfect mix of 

955
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:19,950
personalities because otherwise there's.
Look,

956
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,470
there's nothing wrong with women like.
But what women like and men like is 

957
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,930
varies drastically big fucking 
difference.

958
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,350
And when women are in the mix,
if you're trying to do anything,

959
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,450
especially something creative along 
these lines,

960
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,350
when it's,
uh,

961
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:38,860
it's like freeform conversational type 
shit.

962
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,290
If a woman is in the mix on a regular 
basis,

963
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:43,200
it changes the entire dynamic of the 
show.

964
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,650
Are you going to watch and everything 
you're saying?

965
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,940
Yeah.
You gotTa Watch everything you're saying

966
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:47,410
and to try not to be as rude.
No.

967
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,160
All right.
Yeah.

968
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,020
You gotta you gotta definitely not shit 
on her.

969
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:52,580
The way you should on each other.
You're going to be very aware of.

970
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,020
You can't talk shit to check the way you
could tell it like you just say the 

971
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,020
French shut up stupid.
No,

972
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,240
and that's fine,
but no one ever gets upset.

973
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,970
But if you say that to a girl,
shut up stupid like,

974
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:06,010
eh.
I think our female listeners understand 

975
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,010
that too,
because they're like,

976
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,700
wait,
we get to hear like guys unfiltered.

977
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,780
Yes.
Because you know the guys in their 

978
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,461
lives,
they're around their wives or their 

979
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:14,461
girlfriends.
They're not unfiltered.

980
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:16,610
So radio shows like yourself and ours,
you know,

981
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:21,611
they,
they like to kind of take that peak and 

982
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:21,611
listen to it.
Yeah.

983
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:22,780
That's the only opportunity they can.
Just like when me,

984
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,630
when I listened to out cute gay radio,
I don't listen.

985
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,270
That's the only way I don't ever hear 
that gay people have like conversations.

986
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,970
Is it good?
I really don't know.

987
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,520
I really don't know.
They're nice guys know hall,

988
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,140
but there's um,
I guess I guess I check them out.

989
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:44,170
I just get a kick out of.
I get a kick out of listening to 

990
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,021
everything.
I like listening to conservative talk 

991
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,091
radio.
I like listening to like those really 

992
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:50,480
silly conservative guys where everything
is fucking 100 percent.

993
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,560
It's Joe's.
Yeah.

994
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:52,670
Down the road.
Well he's,

995
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,200
he's little weirder.
Alex has a lot of shit in there.

996
00:41:57,201 --> 00:41:59,000
Like he thinks marijuana should be 
legal.

997
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:03,190
Gay Marriage should be legal.
He's just a conspiracy theorists to the.

998
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,850
You scared me for awhile because I'm 
like,

999
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:06,590
man,
Joe Rogan is a really smart dude.

1000
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,830
And you were really into the Alex Jones 
and I miss.

1001
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,820
Hold on,
I misread it.

1002
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,370
And we finally had that conversation and
you,

1003
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,330
you said it,
you're like,

1004
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,070
I believe.
What 20 percent did you say?

1005
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,030
Like it depends.

1006
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,330
It depends on the subject.
Sometimes I believe 70 to 80 percent of 

1007
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:22,330
the way it says.
Fair enough.

1008
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,060
Because the last time he was on our 
show,

1009
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,150
I was surprised how much I was taking 
what he was saying.

1010
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,240
But then there's been other times it's 
been ridiculous.

1011
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,930
It's crazy,
but he's awesome and fun to listen.

1012
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,890
Do It's an act.
No,

1013
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,170
I know him really well.
It's not an act.

1014
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,740
He's my friend,
but I've,

1015
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:45,741
I've.
I've known that guy for over 10 years 

1016
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:45,741
now.
Alex Jones is exactly who he presented.

1017
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:47,110
I can.
You're not going to give me the total.

1018
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,580
No,
no,

1019
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:47,850
no,
no,

1020
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,650
no.
I'm telling you.

1021
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,750
I'm telling you this,
that he.

1022
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,100
He understands conspiracy,
like living in that world is as good for

1023
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:56,650
his business.
So he,

1024
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,070
he forces some of this shit to continue 
to live in the conspiracy world.

1025
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,590
I,
I,

1026
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,730
I understand why you would see that,
but I don't believe it's that what I 

1027
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,781
believe it is more of it's confirmation 
bias that happens when someone gets 

1028
00:43:10,781 --> 00:43:12,320
really fixated on the idea that there's 
a conspiracy everywhere.

1029
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,100
So they start seeing conspiracies in 
places that they're not right,

1030
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,460
but it doesn't mean that the validity of
some of the shit he's brought up,

1031
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,010
the validity of some of the shit he's 
brought up was unquestionable.

1032
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:27,070
Right now.
There's a lot of stuff that he brings 

1033
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:27,070
up.
And by the way,

1034
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:28,010
he was bringing it up way ahead of 
anybody else he was,

1035
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,040
he was talking about he during the first
days of September 11th,

1036
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,500
he was calling it a false flag attack.
And he was saying that,

1037
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,810
um,
you know,

1038
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:40,010
there was a,
there was possible that,

1039
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,770
you know,
buildings were detonated and like he was

1040
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,390
sticking himself way,
way,

1041
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:46,100
way out on a limb.
And when he did that,

1042
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:47,000
I was like,
wow man,

1043
00:43:47,001 --> 00:43:47,810
you can't.
I was like,

1044
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,000
you can't say that.
That's crazy.

1045
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,930
You can't,
you know,

1046
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:53,630
you can't,
you can't say that they're willing to go

1047
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,040
to war for profit.

1048
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,010
I thought he was being nuts.
I was talking to him.

1049
00:43:58,011 --> 00:43:58,520
I was like,
you know,

1050
00:43:58,521 --> 00:43:59,750
you're just drawing all these 
conclusions,

1051
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,050
but next thing you know,
we're at war with Iraq and nobody 

1052
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:05,540
understands why.
And you know,

1053
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,720
he's saying it's for profiteering,
they're profiteering over there.

1054
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Right?
I don't believe that he's right about 

1055
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,180
like September 11th being orchestrated 
by the government.

1056
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:15,620
I don't think it was orchestrated by the
government,

1057
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:17,720
but I do think that capitalized.
Well,

1058
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,920
of course.
I mean,

1059
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:21,230
one of my thoughts on that is if you 
want,

1060
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,030
let's say you want to bring your country
to war,

1061
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:25,610
right?
And you know that there's some shit that

1062
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:31,090
could be going down in New York City 
like planes going into the fucking 

1063
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:31,090
buildings,
you know,

1064
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,760
that would be technically really good 
for the country because then you would,

1065
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,180
like you said profiteer and,
and,

1066
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:37,640
and,
uh,

1067
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,580
head off to war.

1068
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,950
Why when you let it just happen.
Well,

1069
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,330
one of them was,
that's where,

1070
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,460
that's where I'm,
that's where my line is,

1071
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:47,040
where I wonder in that it's like a gray 
area to me,

1072
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,570
but to,
to think that,

1073
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:53,610
you know,
people were wiring the buildings while 

1074
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:53,700
people were going in and out of work.
That's just ridiculous.

1075
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:59,270
Yeah.
I put them possibly let things happen 

1076
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,270
and go,
you know what?

1077
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,270
All right,
we know this is going down,

1078
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,191
but you know,
it's not the worst thing for what our 

1079
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:04,230
agenda right now.
It's possible.

1080
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:09,290
The real issue is the idea of the false 
flag and the idea of the false flag is 

1081
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,940
the idea that the government would plan 
out a fake attack,

1082
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:14,610
would they do that?
And for most people that answer's no,

1083
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:19,611
no.
Most people say the government would 

1084
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:19,611
never do that,
but the real problem is they've done it.

1085
00:45:19,611 --> 00:45:22,020
They really actually have done it.
Not only have they done it,

1086
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,540
they've planned on doing it a bunch of,
other times they couldn't pull it off.

1087
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,190
There was one from when the Bush 
administration was leaving.

1088
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:31,800
They were talking about in 2007,
I believe it was.

1089
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,240
They were talking about,
uh,

1090
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,500
going into,
uh,

1091
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:39,501
Iran and coming up with a false flag 
attack and in order to get us into war 

1092
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:42,360
with Iran before the administration was 
to set the,

1093
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:47,390
you know,
the next administration has said Obama 

1094
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:47,390
Administration into some crazy fucking 
war that he couldn't control.

1095
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,250
Now in the end,
is that good for the country in their 

1096
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:52,250
minds?
I know,

1097
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:52,980
I think it's profiteering.
I really do.

1098
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:55,710
I think there's any other of your 
buddies,

1099
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,711
right?
There's no other way and it has nothing 

1100
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:00,711
to do with actually make the country 
stronger in the end.

1101
00:46:00,711 --> 00:46:04,970
If you can't justify it militarily,
if you can't justify the reason why 

1102
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,860
you're there,
then you profiteering and you know,

1103
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,380
it's just,
it's really that simple.

1104
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,140
It's like someone profiting amps Fuckin 
lutely.

1105
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,320
Okay,
so you can't justify when you're there 

1106
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,380
and someone's profiting.
That means it's about the profit and 

1107
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,780
that's something that we don't like to 
hear.

1108
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,350
We don't.
We,

1109
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,510
we don't like to accept that shit in 
this country.

1110
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,990
And Alex Jones,
Patriotic Alex Jones brings up all that 

1111
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,701
shit.
The northwoods document and the 

1112
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:31,701
northwest documentaries in the 19 
sixties,

1113
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:35,540
1962,
I think it was before Kennedy was 

1114
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,491
assassinated.
They saw the joint chiefs of Staffs 

1115
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:38,940
Sinus.
They agreed on this.

1116
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,900
They were going to fake a bunch of 
attacks on America by the Cubans.

1117
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:48,170
They were going to blow up a drone jet.
They're going to take a jet flight in 

1118
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,190
the air with radio control.
Then blow it up in the sky.

1119
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,680
They're going to blame it on the cube 
and said,

1120
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:54,880
we're going to arm a Cuban friendlies in
there.

1121
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:56,760
We're going to lob mortars at 
Guantanamo,

1122
00:46:56,761 --> 00:47:01,761
Bang,
possibly killing American civilians or 

1123
00:47:01,761 --> 00:47:04,880
citizens rather,
and they were going to do all this so 

1124
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,031
that we would get angry and we would 
want to go to war with Cuba because the 

1125
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,031
only way we could get to go to war with 
Cuba,

1126
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:08,300
they wrote all this down.

1127
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,210
They're like,
we're good to go.

1128
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,660
Then I'm not.
Kennedy was like,

1129
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,170
get the fuck Outta here with this.
Kennedy vetoed it.

1130
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,860
Where were you at Kennedy?
But he said they killed them.

1131
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,120
I'm almost positive.
I quite a few people.

1132
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:22,350
It was quite a few people wanted that 
guy.

1133
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,150
What's his name?
Came out what?

1134
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,230
A couple days ago,
right?

1135
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,790
Robert Kennedy's kid and them wanted to 
do it.

1136
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,090
No,
he said there's definitely.

1137
00:47:31,091 --> 00:47:33,430
You know that that was definitely a 
conspiracy.

1138
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,320
I don't think there's any question.
I mean,

1139
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:40,321
I think there's a lot of people that 
want to tie things up in a neat little 

1140
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:40,321
packages.
I think that's the least tie.

1141
00:47:40,321 --> 00:47:43,000
A little neat little package on earth.
I really don't,

1142
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,520
just the video alone,
there's a prude or video.

1143
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:50,521
The fact that you know that they had to 
attribute all those wounds to one bullet

1144
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,800
because they found a bullet that hit an 
underpass and ricocheted and so they 

1145
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,371
were like,
they were coming up with a logical 

1146
00:47:59,371 --> 00:47:59,371
reasons why all these wounds.

1147
00:47:59,371 --> 00:48:01,570
It's kind of from three shots.
It's kind of insulting our intelligence,

1148
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:02,060
right?
Yeah.

1149
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,330
Why would they say why would they limit 
it to three shots?

1150
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,510
Because I was the only amount feasible 
for this guy to pull off course to make,

1151
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:14,550
to make it.
One guy had to be no more than three 

1152
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:14,680
shots and it doesn't mean Lee Harvey 
Oswald wasn't in on it.

1153
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:15,700
I don't know.
He could have been.

1154
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:19,510
What the fuck it been.
He had a long history with the CIA.

1155
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,940
Had a long history of being,
living Russia,

1156
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,060
possibly being a Russian spy mean we 
with.

1157
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,150
There's a lot that points to the fact 
that Lee Harvey Oswald was doing some 

1158
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:30,580
shady shit to.
You ever been to Dealey Plaza?

1159
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,390
Yeah,
I've been there.

1160
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,400
Have you been.
There were.

1161
00:48:32,401 --> 00:48:33,760
No,
those whack jobs come out,

1162
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,950
but their books and their card tables.
No,

1163
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,620
there's still reliving.
Oh,

1164
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,170
the day.

1165
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,680
And they all have something to sell.
Oh,

1166
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,170
you haven't seen that?
No,

1167
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,020
I drove through it.
No Man.

1168
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,820
Next time you,
you played Dallas,

1169
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,180
you have to go to Dealey Plaza and you 
have to hang out there for like three or

1170
00:48:49,181 --> 00:48:49,990
four hours.
Well,

1171
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:52,300
we drove through it and it's so weird 
piece of history.

1172
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:53,150
It's smaller than.
Yeah,

1173
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:54,310
it's tiny and it,
it,

1174
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,590
it looks like,
um,

1175
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,460
it looks like a Hollywood stage,
right?

1176
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,850
It looks like a set for a movie because 
nothing has really changed.

1177
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,590
I mean the trees have grown.
That's about it.

1178
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,960
But these people that were there that 
day,

1179
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,540
they're all.
You talk about profiteering to this day.

1180
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:12,541
They're profitero and they go there 
everyday and try to sell their pamphlet 

1181
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:15,270
or their book or,
or whatever the fuck it.

1182
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,170
Someone like you,
you would love it.

1183
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,750
Love that.
Sandy Hook,

1184
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,770
uh,
fully exposed video that's been 

1185
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:24,770
announced.

1186
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,770
I saw that they tried to say it's a 
conspiracy conspiracy.

1187
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,670
Like how,
you know,

1188
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,740
like there was two other shooters and 
they show like even footage that like 

1189
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,660
the news of people like,
like the police catching a guy in the 

1190
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,220
woods and then whatever happened to that
guy and have some of the kids.

1191
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,280
So did the police catch him or not?
Can't they just talked to the police or 

1192
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:44,300
the policing on it as well?
Well,

1193
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,950
I'm waiting for somebody to debunk that.
I've seen the videos.

1194
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,360
I'm like,
something's got to be wrong here.

1195
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,560
They were saying that the tribute video 
was put up a month in advance and I was 

1196
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,081
like,
how do you know that someone did just 

1197
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:58,081
edit something and write it up?
Another video I like.

1198
00:49:58,081 --> 00:49:59,500
It could've been a post that was made a 
month ago.

1199
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,960
They did something else and they just 
took out the stuff and put it.

1200
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,380
The regular video in that could have 
been at.

1201
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,910
There's ways to like fake a timestamp if
you ever,

1202
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,580
you know,
previous posts of your editing.

1203
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,480
I don't know whether or not that's real,
but I,

1204
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:15,280
I do know that whenever anything happens
now,

1205
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:20,320
a million people for conspiracy,
even if it doesn't make any sense,

1206
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:23,560
even though there's no conspiracy,
I love a good conspiracy of love.

1207
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:25,210
A good guy.
We grew up with that shit.

1208
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,970
Do you believe the,
uh,

1209
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,450
a big foot.
That's a good one,

1210
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:31,490
man.
I'm really.

1211
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah.
Yeah,

1212
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,200
yeah.
This is the reason why.

1213
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,560
Two reasons.
One then was going to ask you about 

1214
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:38,560
blackness,
which is on the same page.

1215
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,581
We get Jane Goodall,
who's a world famous primatologist she 

1216
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:42,581
believes in big five.
No.

1217
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,280
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

1218
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,380
Yeah.
She says she's convinced that there's an

1219
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:48,920
undiscovered primate [inaudible].
I'm pretty sure that's her exact words.

1220
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:54,100
She's convinced.
So there's an undiscovered primate 

1221
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,100
living in the Pacific northwest.
So we're.

1222
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,910
The fuckers is the remains.
Well,

1223
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:57,080
the deal is,
well,

1224
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:58,580
you know,
we had a hunter on yesterday.

1225
00:50:58,581 --> 00:51:02,460
This Guy Steven Rinella,
and we were talking about animals like,

1226
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,720
has he ever seen a dead mountain lion?
No,

1227
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,530
never seen a dead mountain lion.
You know,

1228
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,910
you could.
And he's a hunter.

1229
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,560
He's in the woods constantly.
We know mountain lions are real,

1230
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:13,070
but what are the odds of running around 
and finding it dead?

1231
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,360
One it.
It's pretty fucking small,

1232
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:18,110
but no one has found a skeleton.
Skeletal remains and nothing.

1233
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,570
Nothing credible.
Nothing credible.

1234
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,300
But Mountain Lion?
No,

1235
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:22,580
no,
no,

1236
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:22,840
no,
no.

1237
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,350
I'm talking about for bigfoot.
Okay.

1238
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:25,790
Yeah,
but I'm saying I know that,

1239
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:30,791
but the reason why Jane Goodall believes
that it might be a real animal is 

1240
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:35,291
because there was a real animal that 
looked just like that and it lived 

1241
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:35,291
alongside people.

1242
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:37,430
It's called gigantic Pythagoras and the 
photos of them are kind of crazy.

1243
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:42,431
Like they have a recreation at one,
but it's an eight foot tall bipedal 

1244
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:43,000
giant sasquatch.
I mean,

1245
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:48,010
that's really what it is.
But they have actual proof that it 

1246
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,010
lives.
Oh,

1247
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,010
he lived.
Yeah,

1248
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,140
he lived 100 years ago because they have
bones.

1249
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:50,990
Oh,
they do updates that someone was talking

1250
00:51:50,991 --> 00:51:55,991
about.
I believe that that actually was one of 

1251
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:55,991
the few primates that stores.
It's dead.

1252
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:56,940
Like they buried their dead.
They had like,

1253
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,920
they're dead in one area.
Right?

1254
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,220
So they think they,
you know,

1255
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,240
they might've understood life and death 
more than other chimps who just sort of 

1256
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,460
leave their monkey bodies laying around 
after they die,

1257
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,230
you know,
they took care of the bodies,

1258
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,730
you know,
which is really kind of freaky.

1259
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,560
And if they were really,
really smart and multiple,

1260
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,810
all primates are smart,
you know,

1261
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,770
they're all reasonably smart because it 
was a gigantic one.

1262
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,230
Does that big?
It could be smart as fuck,

1263
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,720
but I mean everyone's searching for it 
now.

1264
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,710
Who searching or,
you know,

1265
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,710
I don't know anybody.
I just feel like I could say that.

1266
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:31,970
Say that it's true.
You don't think like people.

1267
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:36,971
I mean that would be amazing for 
somebody if they could prove that 

1268
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:39,500
bigfoot know spike has a new show.
It's like a $10,000,000

1269
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:42,630
challenge or something crazy like that 
to find big for my.

1270
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:47,870
I think I have said too much money,
so don't blame me.

1271
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:49,190
It might not be 10 million or whatever 
it is.

1272
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:53,000
There's a lot of money to go find big 
foot and it's a good concept.

1273
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,500
Yeah,
it's a fucking great concept.

1274
00:52:54,501 --> 00:52:59,501
You know,
and you got to go deep into the woods 

1275
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:00,320
and look for something.
The only guy that I've ever heard tell a

1276
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:05,321
big foot store.
I heard him tell it on your show and 

1277
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:05,321
then he came and told it on my podcast.

1278
00:53:05,321 --> 00:53:06,110
It was Les Stroud,
survivor man,

1279
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:06,920
right.
His,

1280
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,640
his big foot story was a pretty credible
because that guy,

1281
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:12,620
what did he say?
Yes,

1282
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,940
he was.
He had to,

1283
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:15,980
to um,
different encounters.

1284
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,160
One of 'em he was in Alaska and this is 
the most memorable and he was in his 

1285
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,530
tent and sleeping and it was just lying 
in his tent trying to go to sleep.

1286
00:53:24,531 --> 00:53:29,531
And he heard thumping through the woods 
by Peta lease and it was walking on two 

1287
00:53:29,531 --> 00:53:30,880
legs clearly.
And he goes and it was really heavy.

1288
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:34,420
You could tell it was really heavy and 
he didn't know what to do.

1289
00:53:34,421 --> 00:53:39,421
So he just laid there and waited and it 
got closer to him and it was coming 

1290
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:40,720
towards his camp and he said it was 
about 50 feet from him.

1291
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:41,280
It started

1292
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:41,830
both

1293
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,480
like he goes clear primate,
sounds like clear primate sounds.

1294
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:54,810
And he goes and reaches for his camera 
and when he rustles the thing runs off 

1295
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:54,910
and the thing runs off.
He says,

1296
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:56,470
it's running on two legs.
I hear it.

1297
00:53:56,471 --> 00:53:57,520
Thump,
thump,

1298
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:58,660
thump,
thump.

1299
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,130
Fuck.
10.

1300
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,720
You know,
and he to this day,

1301
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,300
is he?
He's convinced that it was a bear.

1302
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:05,980
He said there's no way that was a 
fucking bear.

1303
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:09,670
There's no way it.
I know I've been around every animal,

1304
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,770
you know,
he's a real survivalist.

1305
00:54:11,771 --> 00:54:16,771
You know what I'm saying?
Like that guy goes out there with the 

1306
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:16,771
fucking pocket life and it can last a 
month.

1307
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:17,800
Where it was he who is in Alaska.
Oh,

1308
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,910
you said he was hundreds of miles from 
anybody to do.

1309
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,920
They follow him in on a plane for hours 
before they dropped him off for a week 

1310
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,160
and he runs into this fucking animal out
there.

1311
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,190
There's been a lot of sightings in,
in Alaska by the way.

1312
00:54:30,191 --> 00:54:35,191
It's not just one.
There's hundreds of bigfoot sightings 

1313
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:35,191
and Alaska.
We got to catch one though.

1314
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:35,980
Yeah,
we do too.

1315
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,660
Are you scared of the woods?
Fuck.

1316
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,460
You should be scared of the woods.
Fucking scared.

1317
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:44,490
She'd be scared of everything,
everything natural because then you 

1318
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:44,740
become a part of the food chain here.
When a studio,

1319
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:49,950
the beautiful thing about the studio,
we have eliminated the food chain 100 

1320
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,621
percent.
It's just us in a fucking table and 

1321
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:54,960
yeah,
you don't have to like look out for 

1322
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,390
Jaguars and shit.
If you live somewhere that sucked,

1323
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,730
you'd have to look out for Jaguars.
Well,

1324
00:54:57,731 --> 00:54:59,290
you know when you're going into the 
jungle,

1325
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,510
are you going into the woods?
It's a beautiful thing,

1326
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:02,560
you know,
to be with nature.

1327
00:55:02,561 --> 00:55:07,561
It's beautiful,
but you also agree to be a part of 

1328
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:07,561
nature.

1329
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:07,720
You throw yourself back into the 
lottery,

1330
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,560
right?
You know,

1331
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:13,561
and it's fun for the first couple of 
minutes and then you start seeing those 

1332
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,460
shadows and fucking mind plays tricks on
you.

1333
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:17,940
I was in Montana.
I went hunting for a week.

1334
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:18,700
That's cool.
Yeah.

1335
00:55:18,701 --> 00:55:21,730
We went with the.
Steve Rinella was on yesterday.

1336
00:55:21,731 --> 00:55:23,430
I shot this thing.
Woops.

1337
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,630
Wait,
you shot this thing?

1338
00:55:25,631 --> 00:55:26,620
Yeah,
I shot this thing.

1339
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,450
What is it?
That's a deer.

1340
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,310
That's a nice,
uh,

1341
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,860
how many points?
Eight a point.

1342
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:37,861
Fucking deer we're looking at right now.
Just the skull and the antlers.

1343
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,230
It was a interesting experience.
But to um,

1344
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,400
to camp out like five nights in a,
in,

1345
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:46,480
in,
you know,

1346
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:49,570
like this really wild habitat like that 
man,

1347
00:55:49,571 --> 00:55:52,090
you really,
you start looking around for stuff.

1348
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:54,340
You really keep up.
We found Mountain Lion Shit,

1349
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:55,990
right?
That was a real eyeopener.

1350
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,770
Like you see a big fat rope of shit with
hair it and you're like,

1351
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:03,310
okay,
something killed a deer with its face.

1352
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:08,310
Jesus.
It caught a deer and killed it with its 

1353
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:08,310
face.
It's hanging out here,

1354
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,280
dropping shits.
So how did,

1355
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,300
how did you know you were safe?
Well,

1356
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,680
we had rifles.
Now at night when you're sleeping,

1357
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,580
well,
you're in a tent.

1358
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,910
You know,
it's gonna know where to attack in the 

1359
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:21,520
tent.
It looks at a 10.

1360
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:24,850
It's this big thing that doesn't totally
understand they,

1361
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:27,010
when they smell,
if you have food in the Tan or something

1362
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:28,120
like that,
especially bears,

1363
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,460
it can get really tricky.
But there's no bears in this area.

1364
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,830
Like mountain lions are really 
scavengers.

1365
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,530
They're looking to kill things.
I got to ask you,

1366
00:56:34,531 --> 00:56:39,310
so how is it a to kill Salta?
It's not that hard.

1367
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:41,050
No.
You're all right with that.

1368
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:41,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:46,741
I'm fine with that because I've been 
eating meat my whole life and if you 

1370
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:46,741
don't kill them,
it's not like they live forever.

1371
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,980
You know what you're doing is you're,
you're ending their life in you.

1372
00:56:49,981 --> 00:56:51,610
You're,
you're choosing to end their life.

1373
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:56,611
But their life is very temporary.
It's very temporary in a very harsh 

1374
00:56:56,611 --> 00:56:57,190
climate.
And if you don't do it,

1375
00:56:57,490 --> 00:57:00,640
they get eaten by wolves.
Now I'm not questioning that.

1376
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,580
I just don't think I could do it.
You can do it.

1377
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,640
Of course you could.
Your,

1378
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,820
your personal.
You want to be alive.

1379
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:07,990
Let me tell you something.
You're a father.

1380
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:09,590
Does it bother you at all though?
No,

1381
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,840
not even a little bit.
No.

1382
00:57:10,841 --> 00:57:12,040
I mean,
I have respect for it.

1383
00:57:12,041 --> 00:57:14,140
I have reverence for the animal.
I mean it was,

1384
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:15,050
uh,
you know,

1385
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,770
seeing an animal in the wild like that 
is,

1386
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,440
you know,
I don't want to use the word majestic,

1387
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:22,630
but it's a,
it's a really powerful moment.

1388
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Like you see that animal like wild,
like it's probably never seen a human 

1389
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,670
being before we were in the bad lands in
Montana and you're,

1390
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:32,680
you're running into a deer that very 
likely is,

1391
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,330
you know,
three years old,

1392
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:34,990
two,
three years old,

1393
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:36,850
and I never,
never seen a person ever.

1394
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,040
And then you're sneaking up on them and 
shoot them.

1395
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:41,500
You know,
it's pretty intense,

1396
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,650
but the food is delicious.
It's really nutritious and healthy.

1397
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,720
And if you're a person who eats animal 
protein,

1398
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,490
I can understand the ethics behind,
uh,

1399
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,020
not wanting to cause harm to animals,
not wanting to kill them,

1400
00:57:53,021 --> 00:57:56,560
but especially in the case of big game 
hunting like deer,

1401
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,800
all you're doing is you're,
you're ending their life before a 

1402
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,830
Predator takes them out.
They all get taken out,

1403
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:04,830
but they get taken out and I know 
they're over populated.

1404
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,890
All,
you know,

1405
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,360
how many deer die of old age?
Zero,

1406
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,360
zero.
Literally zero.

1407
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:15,220
They're just fucking making babies.
Wolves are pulling the babies out of the

1408
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:16,310
Mamas Pussy while they're giving birth.
I mean,

1409
00:58:16,311 --> 00:58:21,311
there's a crazy life.
You're out there in the woods is fucked 

1410
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,200
up podcast.
It's as dark as it gets out there in the

1411
00:58:23,201 --> 00:58:28,201
dear world,
so when you come along and blow their 

1412
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:28,840
heart out with a bullet,
I'll have to try it.

1413
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,940
Then.
It's really like the safest.

1414
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,910
I mean not the safest.
It's the most humane way for them to die

1415
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:35,110
ever.
You know,

1416
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:40,111
it's.
I could understand people's points of 

1417
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:40,111
view,
like if you want to be a Vegan,

1418
00:58:40,111 --> 00:58:40,510
if you want to be a vegetarian,
you don't want to cause any harm.

1419
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,920
I,
I totally understand that,

1420
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:46,921
but I think if you do accept that most 
people eat meat and that is the case in 

1421
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:48,130
this culture.
Most people eat meat.

1422
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:53,340
This is the most humane way to acquire 
the meat and all you're doing is acting 

1423
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,250
as a Predator in a world filled with 
predators.

1424
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:57,370
You're not denying any other animal the 
predation,

1425
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:01,030
and in fact the idea is that if done 
correctly,

1426
00:59:01,031 --> 00:59:04,240
it keeps the animal populations healthy.
Silicon fucking starve to death.

1427
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,770
I understand all that.
I'm just thinking of what goes on in 

1428
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,770
your head.

1429
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,770
That's.
No,

1430
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:09,770
it didn't.
I was ready for it.

1431
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,880
I had prepared myself for it for a long 
time,

1432
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:14,520
so I wanted to do this the first time.
Yeah,

1433
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:15,880
the shots.
Yeah.

1434
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,720
Wow.
Cool.

1435
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,010
You know,
and it's not like,

1436
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:20,980
um,
it's a very respectful thing.

1437
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:21,710
I mean,
you're eating,

1438
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:23,360
I'm eating on this whole animal,
you know,

1439
00:59:23,361 --> 00:59:26,120
it takes months to eat it.
There's a lot of meat.

1440
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,680
Yeah.
It's processed and cut.

1441
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:30,830
And I lived in western New York.
We had a lot of venison.

1442
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:32,150
Chili.
Oh yeah.

1443
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,240
I didn't like it.
Western New York is a lot of fucking 

1444
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:37,240
deer.
No Shit.

1445
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,080
When you take that ride from buffalo to 
long island where I brought,

1446
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,770
you know,
I was uh,

1447
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:44,390
brought up all we used to count how many
dead deer on the top of the cars.

1448
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah.
You see a lot of hundreds.

1449
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:47,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1450
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,100
Because,
you know,

1451
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,760
especially during hunting season and all
that,

1452
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,070
and then on the side of the road and all
that crap,

1453
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,900
a lot of people get their cars fucked up
by those deer to.

1454
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:59,900
Yeah.
That's why it's very important to keep 

1455
00:59:59,900 --> 00:59:59,900
deer populations down.
Like people don't understand.

1456
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,120
Like if,
if gear populations get really big,

1457
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,030
first of all,
you got a lot of lyme disease as well,

1458
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:10,180
that,
that happens to ticks travel from deer 

1459
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,180
to deer and they get into people and you
know,

1460
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,200
lyme disease and people's fucking 
devastating to your health.

1461
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,170
Right.
And a lot of that is overpopulation,

1462
01:00:15,171 --> 01:00:16,580
is these fucking deer.
They get,

1463
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,900
I mean,
they can get,

1464
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:18,880
there's a,
there's a,

1465
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:23,000
a road from Massachusetts,
western Massachusetts to uh,

1466
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:27,950
New York to like the White Plains area.
I forget what the road it is probably a,

1467
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:30,710
I want to say [inaudible] 91 maybe.
Whatever it is.

1468
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,400
There's a,
it's a two lane road.

1469
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,060
No,
at one point when you're like,

1470
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,910
I'm not too late.
Two lanes on each side for later.

1471
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:42,911
I guess a way way up in the upstate 
Massachusetts in western Massachusetts 

1472
01:00:42,911 --> 01:00:45,050
as you're driving down in New York,
it gets so bad with deer that you got to

1473
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:46,160
go like 20 miles an hour.

1474
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,160
It's fucking crazy.
They're just darting out in front of the

1475
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,080
lights,
just running out in front of your car.

1476
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,860
You ever see when get hit by a car?
Yeah,

1477
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,200
yeah,
I've seen like fuck up.

1478
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:55,460
It's pretty fucked up.
Yeah.

1479
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,350
I've seen a bunch of them on the side of
the road,

1480
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,300
you know,
in boulder.

1481
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,190
It's weird.
They're not scared of cars at all.

1482
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,380
They don't even run.
They just stand there.

1483
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,180
Really?
Yeah.

1484
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,870
Boulder.
There was a deer.

1485
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,700
We parked the car,
got out,

1486
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,530
the deer was 20 feet away,
20 feet away and we're all just standing

1487
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:13,820
there looking at them and there's like,
Hey,

1488
01:01:13,821 --> 01:01:18,050
what the fuck you bitches looking at it 
and it just keeps eating this grass.

1489
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,680
It was just used to it.
They're so used to it.

1490
01:01:20,681 --> 01:01:23,060
It was just used to cars.
We took a picture of him and got back in

1491
01:01:23,061 --> 01:01:24,530
the car and he jumped across the fence.

1492
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:29,530
I haven't run out,
but they get used to people and you 

1493
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,441
know,
if you don't keep those populations 

1494
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:34,151
down,
they're going to be slamming into your 

1495
01:01:34,151 --> 01:01:34,190
cars at night and they're like little 
crazy squirrels,

1496
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,750
you know,
but they'll kill you.

1497
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:37,880
Like they'll go through your windshield.
No kidding.

1498
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,220
Have you ever seen those photos online?
Have giant through the,

1499
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,550
through the windshield,
but they're beautiful.

1500
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:47,570
I understand that.
Beautiful.

1501
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:49,850
I'm not saying we should eradicate them,
but we should eat them.

1502
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:55,270
You know,
there's nothing wrong with the eating 

1503
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:55,270
them.
There's plenty of them.

1504
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:55,270
I was just trying to get into your head.
Oh,

1505
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:56,870
I was just curious because I've never 
done it.

1506
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:57,620
That's all.
Well,

1507
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:02,621
I never did it until this time and I 
wondered whether or not I was going to 

1508
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:02,621
have a problem with it.
But uh,

1509
01:02:02,621 --> 01:02:03,680
I eat meat.
I've always eaten meat.

1510
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:04,370
I like it.

1511
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:07,130
It's delicious.
Of course it would be hypocritical.

1512
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,900
It's one of my favorite foods in the 
world.

1513
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,640
Which one?
Snake snakes?

1514
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,270
Yeah.
He just love it.

1515
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:17,350
Steak over misskey.
Misskey lump charcoal and salt and 

1516
01:02:18,711 --> 01:02:19,500
pepper.
Bitch.

1517
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,450
And throw it out there.
Do you go with the grass fed?

1518
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,340
Do you ever have the grass fed is 
terrific.

1519
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:25,260
It's fucking beef.
Yes.

1520
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:26,250
Very nice.
Really good.

1521
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:31,251
It's interesting.
It's a different kind of taste and it's 

1522
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:31,251
way better for your body to.
What are you drinking over there?

1523
01:02:31,251 --> 01:02:32,880
Step bulletproof coffee shit that I told
you about,

1524
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,980
but it's made with butter.
Yes.

1525
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,620
It's made with grass fed butter.
What do you learn about this shit?

1526
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,590
This is a guy named Dave asprey who came
onto Brian,

1527
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:41,730
tells me everything.
He's my,

1528
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,290
he's my Yoda.
Brian knows this shit.

1529
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,610
No,
it's like Yoda,

1530
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:49,611
Yoda,
like pretending to be stupid background 

1531
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:49,611
with all the brightest.

1532
01:02:49,611 --> 01:02:50,780
One point on my strengths,
the um,

1533
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,270
this guy,
uh,

1534
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,120
that we had on the podcast,
Dave Asprey,

1535
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:54,930
he,
uh,

1536
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,320
gave us a really fascinating speech 
about Mycotoxins,

1537
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:05,400
some that I wasn't aware of,
but most coffee when you buy coffee from

1538
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,590
a store like starbucks or something like
that,

1539
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,880
it has mold on it and the way that,
like a coffee is stored in the way of 

1540
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:18,460
coffee is treated when it comes off of,
right out of the plantations taken care 

1541
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:23,001
of to is directly proportionate to how 
healthy it is for you and those 

1542
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:27,440
mycotoxins.
You haven't moldy coffee or really 

1543
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,691
fucking bad for you.
That's where liver toxicity and all 

1544
01:03:29,691 --> 01:03:30,550
these different,
these different effects that he like.

1545
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:34,140
There's an issue with some coffee is not
bad for you at all,

1546
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:38,370
but other coffee shows like bad liver 
markings and what that is,

1547
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:42,300
is fungus.
It's in corn and it's in coughing to the

1548
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:43,200
bunch of different shit.

1549
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,320
What kind of coffee is it?
A lot of different colleges.

1550
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,380
Big Guys.
Will you ever see there's a show called 

1551
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,620
the dangerous grounds show is about a 
dude who.

1552
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,580
He's on the travel channel.
He travels to all these different exotic

1553
01:03:56,581 --> 01:04:00,960
places where they make coffee like shows
you what it's like to acquire coffee and

1554
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:05,961
these tropical lands on and he was 
saying that somewhere between 70 plus 

1555
01:04:05,961 --> 01:04:10,191
percent of all the coffee you get has 
mold on it and that could be a health 

1556
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:14,781
issue.
So when people are talking about the 

1557
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:16,671
health issues of coffee,
Dave asprey guy says they're talking 

1558
01:04:16,671 --> 01:04:18,810
about mycotoxins and when you're dealing
with toxin free,

1559
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,490
clean fungus,
free coffee,

1560
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:24,150
you don't have nearly as many issues and
the energy does it.

1561
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:29,151
You don't crash afterwards.
What he's saying is that you're 

1562
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:29,151
basically being poisoned by shitty 
coffee.

1563
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:31,920
Isn't the water killing all that stuff?

1564
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,230
No.
That's the crazy thing about fungus.

1565
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,470
Not too good.
I know it's getting worse.

1566
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:41,210
It sounds like it's fake.
You should get a stephen hawkings device

1567
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,710
was one of those little things and 
click,

1568
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,190
click,
click.

1569
01:04:44,191 --> 01:04:46,110
I don't want to do it.
I don't want to get strep man.

1570
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,870
Oh,
he's not contagious at that.

1571
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,900
Yeah.
Just don't make out with them.

1572
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,700
Um,
your question.

1573
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:53,510
No,
they can't.

1574
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,660
It doesn't.
The boiling,

1575
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:56,040
it doesn't kill them.
See,

1576
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:59,430
they can survive in space.
They can survive on radiation.

1577
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:03,240
Yeah.
Spores can survive and insane places.

1578
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,600
That's one of the main reasons why some 
people believe that a magic mushrooms 

1579
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:11,790
came from outer space.
The idea being that there's,

1580
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:16,850
there's,
they're very different and far as the 

1581
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,341
chemical composition from other 
mushrooms and other and they mirror 

1582
01:05:19,341 --> 01:05:23,371
human neurochemistry and they could 
survive in a vacuum that did survive 

1583
01:05:23,371 --> 01:05:27,541
incredible radiation and we know that 
certain shit has come here from 

1584
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:27,541
asteroids.

1585
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:28,480
We know water's come here from 
asteroids.

1586
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:33,481
We know that things have hit other 
planets and sent things to us and could 

1587
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:34,310
have contained organic matter.
We know,

1588
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:39,340
we know all that,
so they're pretty sure that these 

1589
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,150
fucking spores,
these spores can survive in space.

1590
01:05:40,151 --> 01:05:41,620
And that's how we got some of these 
mushrooms.

1591
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:46,770
Well,
you know that's like prior to that shit 

1592
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,411
that causes mad cow disease that can 
survive like a thousand degrees for like

1593
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:53,160
seven days or something crazy like that.
Like they're,

1594
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,360
they're in,
they're insanely tolerant.

1595
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,030
Does this stuff keeps you awake at 
night?

1596
01:05:57,310 --> 01:06:01,330
Know your head is filled with a lot of 
fucked up.

1597
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,570
Fucked up.
It's fucked up.

1598
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,160
You know,
that's a compliment.

1599
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:09,400
But it's just the way I say it.
So can I take a fucking lake?

1600
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,180
Yeah.
Go take a leak.

1601
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,340
Go through that door and say what 
happens if I take a leak?

1602
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,630
You guys could come on right back.
We'll,

1603
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,090
we'll keep talking.
This is casual as fuck man.

1604
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:21,100
It's the Internet.
You looking at the CEO's of the company 

1605
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,550
right here.
You just never take a break.

1606
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:24,190
We do whatever we want.
So if I needed to take a break,

1607
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:25,780
if I leave,
will he be talking about me?

1608
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,320
No,
unless you want me to help fucking 

1609
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:31,320
though.
Whatever you want.

1610
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,050
Man wants to be talked about whether or 
not in the room.

1611
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,640
Are you checking your twitter like a 
little girl?

1612
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:34,270
What are you doing here,
man?

1613
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,400
Yeah.
It was just checking it out.

1614
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,710
Why not get a couple of plugs in?
That would help.

1615
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:41,830
Fuck.
Got a few followers for Christ sake.

1616
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,350
Follow OPI radio.
O P I e Dot.

1617
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,430
Go through that door and take a right 
right here.

1618
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:48,910
Wouldn't talk some shit about you.
Where you're going.

1619
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,530
What's that?
Yeah.

1620
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:51,190
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

1621
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,950
yeah.
Really?

1622
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,240
Yeah.
You got.

1623
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,180
Yeah,
there's a story.

1624
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:57,100
I knew a motherfucker.
We got to hear something.

1625
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,380
There's a story.
He's got something to show us.

1626
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:01,960
So a poor,
poor Brian.

1627
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:07,290
You got the band aids and uh,
you should call Peter Duesberg up right 

1628
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:07,840
now.
And tell him to go fuck himself.

1629
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,100
Okay.
Listen,

1630
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,860
Peter Duesberg,
I got mouth aids.

1631
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,900
Yeah.
STREP is no joke.

1632
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,930
Two,
how many days is stripped a contagious 

1633
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:19,840
for a,
I think it's the first 48 hours.

1634
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:24,990
Forty eight hours after taking the 
medication and how many hours you've 

1635
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:25,610
been taking the medication?
Seventy two.

1636
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:30,750
So you buffed it give a little buffer.
It feels like there's a piece of glass 

1637
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:31,770
in my throat.
Dude,

1638
01:07:31,771 --> 01:07:33,970
you sound like you're sucking cock for 
years.

1639
01:07:33,990 --> 01:07:36,220
Like they just put you on a cock sucking
plant.

1640
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:38,440
You know,
you just for for a year,

1641
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:41,190
you were in a cock sucker plantation and
that's what they did.

1642
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,970
They just lined you up and you got to 
just suck hawks all day for years.

1643
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,370
Can you imagine a world would that 
existed?

1644
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:50,620
Would that was the punishment that 
someone would bestow upon you?

1645
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,780
GotTa Suck Cox for years,
for years and years and years and years.

1646
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:57,790
You have two years in the cock sucking 
factory.

1647
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:03,090
So they sent me someplace and your 
life's existence is you get four hours 

1648
01:08:03,090 --> 01:08:05,440
sleep a night and the rest of the time 
while you're awake,

1649
01:08:05,441 --> 01:08:07,900
you're sucking decks.
That's your whole day.

1650
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:11,200
You get like five minutes to shove some 
food down your throat,

1651
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:16,530
five minutes to shit twice a day.
And then the rest of it is just sucking 

1652
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:17,000
or death.

1653
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:18,500
Your choice.

1654
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:27,280
There was a guy who did something to 
someone and paralyzed him and the 

1655
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,150
punishment that they gave him was to 
paralyze him

1656
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,920
medically.
Yeah.

1657
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,830
I forget what the story was.
I going to find,

1658
01:08:35,831 --> 01:08:37,870
uh,
the ruling judge's ruling.

1659
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,290
This was like a,
I want to say a couple of years ago.

1660
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:45,280
They apparently has a man found guilty 
of paralysis.

1661
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:45,970
Okay.
Let's see.

1662
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,230
Apparel

1663
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,500
paralyzes them.
One of those words we learned.

1664
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:55,760
Oh,

1665
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,290
paralysis.

1666
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:01,780
Perfect.

1667
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,420
What happened?

1668
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:08,260
I'm talking about some guy who,
uh,

1669
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:13,320
Saudi Arabia was gonna paralyze a man 
who crippled another man.

1670
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:20,440
[inaudible] w I wonder how this,
they were going to.

1671
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,360
This guy had crippled someone so they 
were trying to,

1672
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:29,361
uh,
they wanted a severed his spinal cord 

1673
01:09:29,361 --> 01:09:29,920
cripple him as punishment.
Right?

1674
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,210
And people got really fucking freaked 
out about it.

1675
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:34,170
The Guy,
um,

1676
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:39,260
he stabbed someone and severed their 
spinal cord and they were going to do 

1677
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:44,190
the same thing to him because under 
Sharia law,

1678
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,780
this guy,
uh,

1679
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,740
his victim requested that really?
Yeah,

1680
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,920
I just live in that world under Sharia 
law.

1681
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:57,660
This was his right to seek to wacky as 
part of the world.

1682
01:09:57,661 --> 01:09:59,680
They still deal with.
I mean,

1683
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,460
as an adult and especially as a father 
when you read about the,

1684
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:08,490
the,
the craziness in the world when you see 

1685
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:08,490
like some woman who was just gunned down
because she was a,

1686
01:10:08,491 --> 01:10:11,850
they thought she possibly has been 
guilty of adultery.

1687
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:16,851
So the guy gunder down the street and 
everybody's fine with it and you're 

1688
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:16,851
allowed to.

1689
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:21,270
How these honor killings is don't stick.
Our country could use a little of that 

1690
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:22,440
honor killings.
We'll just something.

1691
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,660
What do you mean?
Fuck man,

1692
01:10:24,661 --> 01:10:29,661
like the Aurora shooter.
I don't feel like seeing his fucking 

1693
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:30,600
face on the news every day.
Why can't we just take them out back and

1694
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,100
shoot him in the fucking head?
Okay.

1695
01:10:32,101 --> 01:10:35,270
But that's a big difference between that
and honored that.

1696
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,170
I was just bringing it all together.
No,

1697
01:10:37,171 --> 01:10:39,540
of course I don't want honor killings in
America.

1698
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:40,870
I was like,
what do you think?

1699
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,180
I think we're a bunch of pussies as far 
as we take care of some of these fucking

1700
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:50,181
people.
You want to take care of school 

1701
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:51,561
shootings?
Fucking fucking take these guys out 

1702
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:51,561
immediately.
Yeah.

1703
01:10:51,561 --> 01:10:55,131
You have to also find out what the fuck 
is going on with her mind though in 

1704
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:55,860
keeping them alive.
You can study them.

1705
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,800
You could find out what,
what we might be able to prevent ones in

1706
01:10:58,801 --> 01:11:01,400
the future.
We might have like markers or flags that

1707
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,390
they think,
yeah,

1708
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:07,170
they gotta they gotta figure out what it
is psychologically and they also have to

1709
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:09,690
figure out what it is.
I'm chemically right,

1710
01:11:09,691 --> 01:11:12,990
because a lot of these guys are on 
antidepressants more than 90 percent of.

1711
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,140
In fact,
I think.

1712
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:19,190
I think the mental illness part of this 
whole equation is way worse than the 

1713
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:19,190
fucking gun part.
Yeah,

1714
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:19,190
you're,
you're right.

1715
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,090
Absolutely right.
I mean,

1716
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:26,190
Timothy,
Timothy Mcveigh killed a lot of people 

1717
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:26,190
with fertilizer.
Right?

1718
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:28,230
If somebody wants to kill you,
they can kill you.

1719
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,260
And I agree with you.
Yeah.

1720
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:32,580
This is such a weird chill environment.
Is it?

1721
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:33,570
Yeah,
man.

1722
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,640
Just do it.
So out of my element.

1723
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,050
No,
you know,

1724
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:42,290
but it's cool though,
but what I'm trying to step out of my 

1725
01:11:42,290 --> 01:11:42,840
comfort zone does these days different 
things.

1726
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:47,841
Yeah.
Because like the type of radio show I 

1727
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:47,841
do,
I,

1728
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:47,841
I,
I could almost do it in my sleep now.

1729
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:47,841
Right,
right,

1730
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,740
right.
And you got to test environment to me is

1731
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:51,330
really fucking strange.
I'm just,

1732
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:56,331
I'm just pointing out some shit.
You guys have really become a home for 

1733
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:58,020
the comedian hangout,
right?

1734
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,820
You know,
we used to hate comics on the,

1735
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:00,570
on the,
uh,

1736
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:00,930
show.

1737
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:02,310
Really?
Yeah.

1738
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:05,050
When we're in Boston.
Wow.

1739
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:10,160
We fucking hated it.
And then when we first kicked in New 

1740
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:13,400
York,
we fucking hate it because we had guys 

1741
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:14,820
that came in and instead of just having 
the conversation we're having or just be

1742
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:19,821
funny because if you're a standup,
can't you just be funny and about a lot 

1743
01:12:19,821 --> 01:12:24,141
of these guys at first because we 
weren't getting the quality comics 

1744
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,811
either because we just starting out,
they came in and they wanted their pit 

1745
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:29,901
set up.
Why can't you just come in and have a 

1746
01:12:29,901 --> 01:12:31,530
conversation and maybe we'll fit in one 
of your bits or whatever.

1747
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:35,280
I don't give a fuck,
but let's talk about some shit and maybe

1748
01:12:35,281 --> 01:12:39,150
you get some jokes out there.
So we actually avoid a comics for a long

1749
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,230
fucking time.
And then,

1750
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:42,210
you know,
when you do radio in New York,

1751
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:43,050
you can't avoid it.

1752
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,110
And we finally embraced it and you know,
we'd love it.

1753
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:48,060
Of course we love when you guys come in.
Well,

1754
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:51,300
you guys figured out how to do it the 
perfect way,

1755
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:56,570
then let real comics come in and just 
fuck around and shoot the shit and talk 

1756
01:12:56,570 --> 01:12:59,710
shit and it creates these unbelievably 
hysterical moment.

1757
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:01,140
Sure.
Whereas,

1758
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,570
you know,
if you got a guy just come in and set up

1759
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:05,590
as bits,
how long can you do that for you?

1760
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,370
That's not even a real conversation,
but that's what they want.

1761
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:11,130
A lot of radio stations they like even I
did,

1762
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:16,180
I did a big radio station like a couple 
of years ago and they still asked me to 

1763
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:16,180
do this.
Oh really?

1764
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,420
They go,
we would like you to know,

1765
01:13:17,421 --> 01:13:22,421
uh,
what questions you would like to be 

1766
01:13:22,421 --> 01:13:22,421
asked to set up your bids.
And I go set up my bits.

1767
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:23,700
And the guy was like,
disappointed.

1768
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:24,720
They're like,
what bits are you going to do?

1769
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,490
I go,
what am I going to do?

1770
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:31,580
What we did not,
we did not know who's coming into your 

1771
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:31,580
fucking show.
Yeah.

1772
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:35,190
I can understand if it's somebody where 
maybe the comedy club made you take him,

1773
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,940
but someone like you.
Really it was,

1774
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,170
why would you waste your time with that 
shit?

1775
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:45,230
I only did it because I was not.
I don't mean you then when they had an 

1776
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,370
opportunity to have you just,
you know,

1777
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,140
talking on the radio show itself was 
great.

1778
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:54,170
It was the producer that was just 
weirded me out with all the was so 

1779
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:56,680
disappointed in me that I didn't have 
bits of prepared and I was like,

1780
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,830
what bits are you going to do?
And I was like,

1781
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:01,230
what are you talking about man?
Can we just go out there,

1782
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,150
put us,
put us on that radio thing,

1783
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,200
right?
Get out of here.

1784
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:05,880
You're fucking my head man.
Exactly.

1785
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:11,250
And those dudes do fuck with your head 
too because part of like a fun radio 

1786
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,280
show is like having a good time and 
being relaxed

1787
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,930
and when you're around someone who's 
super tense,

1788
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,030
what they don't understand as they tend 
to you up to.

1789
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:16,810
Right?
You're like,

1790
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:20,310
why you so weirded out about me going on
the radio or stop being a pussy.

1791
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,240
Just press play.
Well with that said,

1792
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:25,570
how many cool shows are,
are there out there?

1793
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:26,770
Very few.
Right?

1794
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:28,480
It's like a handful,
a handful,

1795
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,370
handful scattered across the country 
named five.

1796
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:35,800
Kevin had been in la for sure,
and I'll say this,

1797
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:37,120
there might be,
there might be more.

1798
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:39,550
I'm just telling you named five because 
you're going to piss off somebody.

1799
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:40,300
No,
I can't.

1800
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:43,720
Then I'll stop right there.
I'm not because I don't mean to know,

1801
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:48,721
but I'm just,
I'm just want to hear any nonsense from 

1802
01:14:48,721 --> 01:14:49,020
Alex Jones.
Alex Jones,

1803
01:14:49,021 --> 01:14:50,100
all you need,
ladies and gentlemen,

1804
01:14:50,101 --> 01:14:52,800
we've got Internet radio.
We've got live radio.

1805
01:14:52,801 --> 01:14:55,530
We are a hundred people strong in 
affiliate.

1806
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,540
One of the best things is when Jim 
Norton said,

1807
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:00,580
uh,
about Alex Jones and never thought of.

1808
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:05,581
He brought up this brilliant point.
Was that how he always talks about like 

1809
01:15:05,581 --> 01:15:07,900
the government is,
they're changing the papers.

1810
01:15:07,901 --> 01:15:12,901
They're doing this with the papers,
but then he uses the government's 

1811
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:14,830
research and papers for other points.
But it's true.

1812
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:17,410
It's like you can't do both,
right?

1813
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:19,330
You can,
but it's not as effective.

1814
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,670
That sounds like it hurts a lot to tell 
them.

1815
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:22,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

1816
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:24,640
That's like fucked up.
Yeah,

1817
01:15:24,641 --> 01:15:26,710
he definitely does do that.
I mean,

1818
01:15:26,711 --> 01:15:27,280
look.
Well,

1819
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:29,770
don't worry about all that,
but Alex is also a guy who,

1820
01:15:29,771 --> 01:15:30,700
uh,
you know,

1821
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:33,010
he'll,
he'll research shit that a lot of people

1822
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:38,011
wouldn't.
He'll find out some things and a lot of 

1823
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:38,011
people wouldn't.
Maybe he's a little wacky.

1824
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:38,770
Yeah,
I would say.

1825
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:39,820
Yeah,
he's a little wacky.

1826
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,940
My Pierce Morgan,
it was awesome.

1827
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:45,670
I loved,
it was just great fucking TV.

1828
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:47,350
It's just great theater.
I just went,

1829
01:15:47,351 --> 01:15:50,200
loved it when he was pretending when he 
was having the English accent,

1830
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:51,650
who's was talking to a peer.
So I think it's actually,

1831
01:15:51,651 --> 01:15:53,890
it's like Alex,
you crazy motherfucker.

1832
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:56,170
I wouldn't have blamed peers if you 
punched him at that point,

1833
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:57,880
but yeah,
he appears,

1834
01:15:57,881 --> 01:15:59,650
I think in the end it's just a fucking 
pussy.

1835
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,740
Yeah,
he really did say you're just a pussy.

1836
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,070
He seems very gross to me.
I Dunno.

1837
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:05,740
Peers.
Yeah.

1838
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,810
Some very dirty.
There's some.

1839
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:12,811
Yeah,
there's something going on there and he 

1840
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:12,811
got into some shit over there in 
England,

1841
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:12,811
so he's dirty.
Yeah.

1842
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:17,760
But it's just like,
I think he's a very intelligent guy and 

1843
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:17,760
he's a very good host.
But man,

1844
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,130
I feel like if he was involved in 
tabloid journalism before,

1845
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:23,530
this is what she was.
Yeah.

1846
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,420
It just seems like,
why would you,

1847
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:27,730
why do you want to talk to that guy 
right there?

1848
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:29,900
Those kind of guys are gross.
Like that thing,

1849
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:32,190
the tabloid journalism like that.
It's just really.

1850
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:37,380
And they did this sneaky shit.
They like listening on people's phones 

1851
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,380
and stuff.
That was peers.

1852
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:38,530
Yeah.
That is really gross.

1853
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,990
That's really gross stuff.
You know?

1854
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,130
It's like,
why?

1855
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:43,720
Why would anybody want to get involved 
with that?

1856
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:48,721
But Alex wanted to deport them because 
he said something about the second 

1857
01:16:48,721 --> 01:16:48,910
amendment is going after him.

1858
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,820
It's like,
so it was just great theater,

1859
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,700
deported.
They know.

1860
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:59,400
You go back to England and socialism,
you can't take our guns.

1861
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:04,920
He gets so angry and just watch you do 
that.

1862
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:09,921
Well,
he's so fun to watch and you see pierce 

1863
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:09,921
like holding it down in very 
professional.

1864
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:12,410
He plays,
he played them like a master.

1865
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:17,710
But when you don't understand is you can
never win against Alex Jones because he 

1866
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:21,581
will never feel ridiculous.
Slight pierces trying to like embarrass 

1867
01:17:21,581 --> 01:17:24,290
him by being quiet while Alex Jones 
screams and yells,

1868
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:29,650
but then you just allow Alex Jones to go
into full Alex Jones mode and then 

1869
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:33,371
you're fucked because then you're 
dwarfed by his personality and he's 

1870
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:33,371
saying Hilarious Shit.
You know,

1871
01:17:33,371 --> 01:17:34,880
he's talking to you in an English 
accent.

1872
01:17:34,881 --> 01:17:35,940
You're not even addressed.
Again.

1873
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:41,710
Cheerio old chap.
Can't take all guns away and pierce is 

1874
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,000
just peers.
We'll have him back because he knows.

1875
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,470
That's good.
That's good tv.

1876
01:17:45,710 --> 01:17:49,820
I'm sure he will have to.
I'm sure he will have them back.

1877
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:54,970
So what else is going on here that they 
went from Larry King to that guy so 

1878
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:55,370
fast.
They had to do something.

1879
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:58,910
I guess we've had Larry on the show.
He's awesome.

1880
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:00,270
He's elect Larry.
He.

1881
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,750
He tells a good story.
Still the smell.

1882
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:06,740
He looks like he would like antique 
bookstore or something.

1883
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:07,460
Yeah,
he's.

1884
01:18:07,490 --> 01:18:10,820
He's awesome.
He has lots of great stories.

1885
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,950
You can have mine.
He'll do it.

1886
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:17,230
Seemed like a real nice guy.
I've done his show a couple times when 

1887
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:18,170
he was on CNN a couple times for fear 
factor.

1888
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,000
Really.
Was that intimidating?

1889
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:25,030
Being on CNN,
it was weird because that's a big 

1890
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:25,550
international audience.
It was very friendly.

1891
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:26,680
He was very friendly.
So no,

1892
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,310
that didn't bother me.
No.

1893
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,030
You ever get nervous about people 
watching me on TV?

1894
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:36,830
None of that show.
I don't really know what you did between

1895
01:18:36,831 --> 01:18:39,830
the UFC and fear factor and I've just 
done it so many times,

1896
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:41,560
especially the UFC,
which is like,

1897
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:47,090
to me the like I owe those people that 
are fighting.

1898
01:18:47,091 --> 01:18:50,330
I owe them my best performance more than
anybody.

1899
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:55,410
Doesn't mean like the guy has a great 
fight and I don't do great commentary 

1900
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,610
over his great fight.
To me it doesn't feel like,

1901
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:00,520
you know,
if I fail my,

1902
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:02,900
my side of the bargain,
I,

1903
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:08,290
I feel very shitty.
So have any of those guys ever taken a 

1904
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:08,290
swing at you?
For?

1905
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:13,310
Some dudes have been upset at me,
but I've never been disrespectful in my 

1906
01:19:13,311 --> 01:19:15,410
depictions of like,
I don't like in a weird way,

1907
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:20,411
it's brave because you're living.
That's a crazy world to live in this 

1908
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:20,411
crazy world and you're critiquing some 
of these guys.

1909
01:19:20,411 --> 01:19:25,210
I've always water men.
I wonder if just one of those guys have 

1910
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:25,790
taken a shot at it doesn't mean that 
they can't kick my ass,

1911
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,800
but it doesn't mean that I'm wrong.
I know.

1912
01:19:27,801 --> 01:19:29,980
I know what could make them better,
you know,

1913
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:35,060
but they don't want to hear that.
So that's why I wonder if they've ever 

1914
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:39,131
taken it personally and by the way,
they might not even be able to 

1915
01:19:39,131 --> 01:19:39,131
physically achieve what I'm asking them 
to do.

1916
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:42,700
Some guys that get into striking too 
late and uh,

1917
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:43,370
you know,
you could say,

1918
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:48,371
well he needs to do is really go to a 
great striking camp and really get a 

1919
01:19:48,371 --> 01:19:49,520
striking together because he's missing 
this big hole.

1920
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:53,300
There were some guys athletically,
I don't know what it is,

1921
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:57,560
but they know they can never really get 
the striking part downright.

1922
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:02,710
It's weird thing.
It's like sometimes you see it in it's 

1923
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:06,640
rare wrestlers who have been wrestling 
for a long time and um,

1924
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,860
for whatever reason they can't seem to 
get snap and their punches.

1925
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:15,860
It's really weird.
And there's some guys who have it like 

1926
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:15,860
right away,
like you,

1927
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:19,921
you start holding the pads for them and 
right away they're scary as fuck with 

1928
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:19,921
their power.
They're just super athletes.

1929
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,290
But some guys can't get that striking 
together.

1930
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,600
And I don't know what that is.
I really don't understand it.

1931
01:20:24,601 --> 01:20:26,970
I've seen it.
I don't know if it's an age thing.

1932
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:29,730
I don't know if they caught it too late 
in life and they don't.

1933
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:34,731
They just cannot develop the kind of 
explosive that shit is obviously 

1934
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:34,731
movement.
Yeah.

1935
01:20:34,731 --> 01:20:35,580
And when you see these guys okay.
Yeah.

1936
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:36,990
Immediately.
To me they look,

1937
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,860
they all look like they could strike.
Well yeah.

1938
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,920
Well it's one of those things where if 
you,

1939
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:48,290
the more you appreciate martial arts,
the more you understand martial arts,

1940
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,150
the in the more techniques that you 
know,

1941
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:53,880
the more you appreciate seeing the 
application of the techniques.

1942
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:59,270
So like when people say like,
you know why you getting so excited 

1943
01:20:59,270 --> 01:20:59,270
about it,
you know,

1944
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:02,451
mma,
why do you watch a Jujitsu matches and 

1945
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:02,451
go crazy.
Like why you get so excited about it?

1946
01:21:02,451 --> 01:21:03,990
Because I know how hard it is to do with
that guy's doing.

1947
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:05,520
I know it intimately,
you know,

1948
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:09,630
so when you see a guy who's triangle and
some guy and you hear me screaming,

1949
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,080
it's because this fucking dude just 
pulled off a crazy as triangle.

1950
01:21:13,081 --> 01:21:14,040
It's hard to do.
Right?

1951
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:19,460
So I am extra excited because I'm 
intimately aware of how difficult it is 

1952
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:20,830
to do with this guy's trying to do.
Oh,

1953
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,100
I love how you call fights.
It's great.

1954
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:23,970
It's fun,
man.

1955
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,170
It's,
it's a fun Gig,

1956
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:25,760
right?
That,

1957
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,080
that's,
that's the only thing that I ever.

1958
01:21:28,081 --> 01:21:29,460
I don't,
I wouldn't say nervous.

1959
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,160
That's the only thing that I ever do.

1960
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:34,800
I feel like my responsibility is more 
than just me.

1961
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:35,680
It's like the,
the,

1962
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:39,930
the guys fighting as well.
It's a sport to the fact that,

1963
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,270
you know,
the fan base of millions of fans,

1964
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,610
you know,
if I'm their favorite guy to do this,

1965
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:47,840
like I can't like slack off.
They're like that,

1966
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:50,160
that I take like I take that super 
seriously.

1967
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:53,850
So if I ever do feel pressure it's then.
But that pressure is good pressure,

1968
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:59,390
you know?
But like as far as like doing this or 

1969
01:21:59,390 --> 01:21:59,390
doing Larry King or something like that,
it was easy.

1970
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:03,630
Like I did TV yesterday.
I'm doing a show for TVS.

1971
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:07,260
Who gets the last laugh?
It's a passionate coachers company.

1972
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:09,330
Oh really?
They're kind of reinventing punked.

1973
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,210
I did something with Ashton Kutcher's 
company.

1974
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:13,710
They were great people.
I didn't meet,

1975
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,840
I didn't meet astrium but the people 
were awesome.

1976
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:21,500
I'm handsome men,
so I'm in front of the line for 

1977
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:21,500
features.

1978
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:21,500
I'm in front of a live audience,
you know,

1979
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:22,020
on a,
on a stage,

1980
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:24,840
sort of.
They're basically like,

1981
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:27,190
I directed a prank,
kind of like what you've seen on,

1982
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:30,000
you know,
on pumped and there's three of us and we

1983
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:30,700
all,
uh,

1984
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:34,470
directed a prank and then we present it 
to a live studio audience.

1985
01:22:34,471 --> 01:22:37,150
That's fucking horrifying for me.
But I,

1986
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,640
but I could do radio,
like,

1987
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,540
like,
you know,

1988
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:42,900
I never get nervous doing radio.
But you're also doing radio to your fans

1989
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:45,180
while.
Yeah,

1990
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:45,900
I mean,
first of all,

1991
01:22:45,901 --> 01:22:46,800
they,
they introduced me.

1992
01:22:46,801 --> 01:22:49,830
No one knows who the fuck I am.
Well you didn't stack the deck.

1993
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,010
What do you mean you didn't tell the ONA
fans to get tickets?

1994
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,830
I should've.
I know.

1995
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:59,870
Know keeps you.
Shall throw that fucking phone in the 

1996
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,300
toilet.
You do that little bird that keeps going

1997
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:04,870
off for a couple minutes to burn.
In a previous podcast we talked about

1998
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,120
previous podcast.
We were talking about how every time I'm

1999
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,700
at a restaurant that goes out,
people are like,

2000
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:11,950
you just whistle at me with a little 
weird.

2001
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:13,000
I gotta be honest with you.
Look,

2002
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:18,001
it's one of my guys.
Great interview and Rogan asked to try 

2003
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:18,001
his uh,
uh,

2004
01:23:18,001 --> 01:23:18,970
deprivation tank.
Trippy.

2005
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,460
Trippy.
I do want to try that.

2006
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:26,700
I want to float to do a.
is there a place in New York where you 

2007
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:26,700
could do it?
I don't know.

2008
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,220
I gotta look it up.
But anyway.

2009
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:28,240
Yeah,
I need to open one.

2010
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,580
But it was horrified just presenting my 
stupid prank.

2011
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:34,080
So if you stack the deck with a ONA 
fans,

2012
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:36,040
I don't think you would have been.
They were cool.

2013
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,880
There was no.
Yeah,

2014
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,550
it was great.
It was great because it was funny.

2015
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,460
But my point is I don't do a lot of tv,
so when I do,

2016
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:45,190
it's like you want to talk about 
stepping out of your comfort zone.

2017
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,590
Fuck yeah,
that could fuck with you.

2018
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:52,591
That's like what?
Like when you see those sportscaster 

2019
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:52,591
guys that had been doing it like a 
million years and they were like,

2020
01:23:52,591 --> 01:23:57,150
you know,
like the nfl guys or any of these guys 

2021
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,150
that had been,
you know,

2022
01:23:57,150 --> 01:23:57,150
they just so smooth and whatever they 
do,

2023
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,690
they've been there,
done that.

2024
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,240
So it's all about doing the job.
It's not about,

2025
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:02,560
oh shit,
we're on TV.

2026
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:05,440
That's out the window now.
It's just about being a job.

2027
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,880
Yeah.
He used to be nervous doing radio.

2028
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,070
I mean,
but that left years ago.

2029
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:12,620
So the only person who's ever 
intimidated me,

2030
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,740
it was a ray Liotta,
diddy,

2031
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:16,840
intimidating,
you know what it was about him.

2032
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,110
But he came in recently and I,
I definitely did better.

2033
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:23,350
I just did better.
He was one of these guys,

2034
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,460
man,
I don't know what it is.

2035
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:29,880
I was fucking intimidating the first 
time he came in where I was barely 

2036
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:33,670
talking and he finally looked at me and 
he goes,

2037
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,230
hey,
is that guy sick,

2038
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:39,210
sick,
sick.

2039
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,290
I don't know what it was.
It's like,

2040
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:47,670
no one else does that to me.
But Ray Liotta and then the fans knew 

2041
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:47,860
and then when know when he was coming 
back in,

2042
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:50,110
they were all talking about tweeting and
you know,

2043
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,170
I did all right the second time.
But he's a bad motherfucker.

2044
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:56,320
I don't know what it is.
I guess respect for his acting funky.

2045
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,610
Goodfellas.
Fuck you.

2046
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:00,430
Come on man.
Did you ever see him in New York?

2047
01:25:00,490 --> 01:25:01,660
He's in Narcan,
right?

2048
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:03,250
No.
To breathing.

2049
01:25:03,251 --> 01:25:05,530
Yoda is a bad motherfucker was a bad 
ass.

2050
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:09,520
So I think it's him in the dark.
You're gonna have to look that shit up.

2051
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:15,260
Okay.
I have to go to the imd and see what's 

2052
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:15,260
up.
But uh,

2053
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,540
just his performance and goodfellows.
I mean,

2054
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:20,050
to me it was so good the way he was 
keeping everything together,

2055
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:25,260
you know,
running back and forth between the coke 

2056
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,240
house,
his girlfriend there and she throws a 

2057
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:27,240
brick of coke.

2058
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:27,850
Adam.
It was just like when,

2059
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,480
when he was in the car and he was 
driving around the helicopters were over

2060
01:25:31,481 --> 01:25:36,481
the head like you were there with him 
and kid and your high with them and I 

2061
01:25:36,481 --> 01:25:37,150
don't know what the fuck.
Yeah,

2062
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,050
really owed.
It was in that.

2063
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:41,230
I don't know what the fuck they did to 
his eyes and that scene.

2064
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:46,231
I mean maybe they kept him up and gave 
him coke because he looked like he was 

2065
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:46,231
coked out.
No,

2066
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:47,500
those are the eyes that that's what did 
it.

2067
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:48,780
Yeah.
I was staring at his,

2068
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:49,930
at his eyes,
you know,

2069
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:54,931
because when you're,
you got guys in your interview and you 

2070
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:54,931
got to look them right in the fucking 
eyes.

2071
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:54,931
And I was looking in his eyes.
I'm like,

2072
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:59,731
fuck,
that's fucking freaking me the fuck out.

2073
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:05,760
Freaking me out.
That scene where his eyes were all 

2074
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:05,760
fucked up and he was driving in the car.

2075
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,860
I'm like,
that guy.

2076
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:11,920
That's pretty much his eyes so well,
but I'm telling you that it's pretty 

2077
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,491
much his eyes in general.
So you ever think about like a shit 

2078
01:26:15,491 --> 01:26:17,230
actor doing that same part.
If you take some guy with an actor,

2079
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:22,420
of course can do that same part that him
knowing where it really oded ever done 

2080
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:23,900
it and this is difference and would we 
know,

2081
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:26,360
we would not know.
Goodfellas is a good movie.

2082
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:28,100
Yeah.
I wonder about that a lot.

2083
01:26:28,101 --> 01:26:30,410
Like these bad fucking comedies that 
come out.

2084
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:34,700
You wonder if they got a different guy.
Would that have changed everything?

2085
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,110
Yeah.
If you got.

2086
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:41,510
You don't mean if you've got someone 
else to play this character.

2087
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:45,630
This movie could never been as good.
Ray Liotta was born to play this cat.

2088
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:50,650
Sure,
but it's not saying that someone 

2089
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:50,650
couldn't have come up with something 
else.

2090
01:26:50,650 --> 01:26:51,410
Do you like caring about the actors that
were also up for roles like that?

2091
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,980
That's always fascinating.
Yeah.

2092
01:26:52,981 --> 01:26:55,520
I don't have an example right now.
Nobody could have done this.

2093
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:58,620
He was so fucking perfect with this.
It was so perfect.

2094
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:02,130
What are you looking at it?
Looking at?

2095
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:07,600
Look at sheer.
There is that guys.

2096
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,430
There's a few of those guys out there 
that are like real craftsman.

2097
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:12,250
Like Daniel Day Lewis,
really?

2098
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,670
Yoda,
Russell Crowe.

2099
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:16,790
Before he got fat and lazy.
We could still kick it out of the park,

2100
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:17,930
man.
He wanted to.

2101
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:19,850
He's been gone a while now.
Yeah.

2102
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:21,200
He needs a hit.
Yeah.

2103
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,280
But it's,
you know what it is.

2104
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:27,281
They keep the just get fucking crazy.
It's nutty life to be a movie star out 

2105
01:27:27,281 --> 01:27:28,880
there.
Jet Set in the globe trying to keep your

2106
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:30,560
shit together.
Or would you like to do that?

2107
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:32,060
Fuck that.
No.

2108
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:37,120
Why not?
Zero interest in making movies was 

2109
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:37,120
because it's not fun.
It's,

2110
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,750
it's thing you build up to a long point 
in time and then the fun things in the 

2111
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,750
movie comes out.
Yay.

2112
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,300
And then nobody likes it.
But all that making of the movie shit.

2113
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:46,460
That shit takes forever.
It takes forever.

2114
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,100
You're stuck in a time of.
Yeah.

2115
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,210
No,
nothing.

2116
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,890
Not really interested.
I get it.

2117
01:27:51,950 --> 01:27:53,540
I see how other people would like to do 
it.

2118
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:56,020
But to me I said it can be podcasting,
you know,

2119
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:58,310
or I could be doing standup or I could 
be doing something else.

2120
01:27:58,311 --> 01:27:59,840
Like why would I want to do that?
I want to do that.

2121
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,250
She looks boring.
My,

2122
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:06,251
uh,
my latest thing is exploring the 

2123
01:28:06,251 --> 01:28:06,251
exploring New York City.
Oh,

2124
01:28:06,251 --> 01:28:06,830
really?
Exploring.

2125
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,940
Did you ever see dark days where the 
bowl people used to live?

2126
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,790
Oh,
dark days is a grit.

2127
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,570
Well,
I shouldn't say it's a great document.

2128
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:15,910
It's a weird document.
It's a weird.

2129
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,920
It's a really cool documentary.
It's black and white and basically it 

2130
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:20,920
talks about the Amtrak tunnel under,
uh,

2131
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,720
the upper west side.
Uh,

2132
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:24,350
and you went down in there.
Yeah,

2133
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,440
I've been wanting to do that forever 
because you worry about the super aids 

2134
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:33,270
that are not super a pitcher.
If you go that far to the middle of the 

2135
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:33,830
earth,
the fuck would happen.

2136
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,600
When did you do this post or Pre Sandy?
Uh,

2137
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:40,370
after I only about a month ago.
There's a guy coming on our show that,

2138
01:28:40,371 --> 01:28:41,810
uh,
I forgot the name of his book.

2139
01:28:41,811 --> 01:28:45,800
Hidden cities of the world are under a 
fuck.

2140
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:50,890
You could probably look it up.
His name's Moses because you have a TV 

2141
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:50,890
show.
No,

2142
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:51,160
but he's connected with a lot of those 
guys there.

2143
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:56,290
It's like a,
it's like a network of guys and they go 

2144
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:56,290
around the world like,
Hey,

2145
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:59,950
you come to Paris,
I'll show you our shit and then we'll 

2146
01:28:59,950 --> 01:28:59,950
come to New York.

2147
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:00,650
You show us your shit.
So you went with them.

2148
01:29:01,050 --> 01:29:03,300
I went with this Guy Moses and we went 
into the,

2149
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:05,760
the old Amtrak tunnel and the train 
still run,

2150
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:10,790
but that's where the mole people used to
live under riverside park on the upper 

2151
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:14,481
west side and we went into a little 
fucking rat hole on the side of the 

2152
01:29:14,481 --> 01:29:15,470
highway and there was one holy wanted me
to go through them.

2153
01:29:15,471 --> 01:29:18,150
Like get the fuck out of here was just 
garbage and smell,

2154
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:20,340
like just horrendous.
I go,

2155
01:29:20,341 --> 01:29:25,341
let's see if there's another hole.
And we went a little further and sure 

2156
01:29:25,341 --> 01:29:26,190
enough there was a whole just enough to 
get your fucking body in and then all of

2157
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:29,130
a sudden you're,
you're under underground in this tunnel.

2158
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,490
Where were these people lived?
Wow.

2159
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:33,480
Some of these people lived down there 
for like 20,

2160
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:35,430
25 years.
They kicked everybody out.

2161
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,060
They kicked them out in,
um,

2162
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:38,850
I don't know,
like the mid nineties finally.

2163
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
How weird are people that they just find
these little collective groups of other 

2164
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:51,020
people willing to live in a tunnel and 
they find each other and they all live 

2165
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:51,020
together.
Yeah.

2166
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:51,600
I mean,
a lot of them are drug addicts.

2167
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:54,300
How many down there?
They don't really know.

2168
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,160
I mean,
some say hundreds.

2169
01:29:56,161 --> 01:29:58,950
Some say thousands.
They don't really know.

2170
01:29:58,951 --> 01:29:59,900
In dark days.
They,

2171
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:02,190
the documentary,
they didn't do a really good job because

2172
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:04,350
I would have loved to know that type of 
shit.

2173
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:05,190
They focused on,
uh,

2174
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:10,640
probably uh,
about a dozen people that were living 

2175
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,981
down there.
How would they built a little really 

2176
01:30:12,981 --> 01:30:12,981
nice fucking living arrangements for 
themselves down there.

2177
01:30:12,981 --> 01:30:13,600
Like,
really?

2178
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,570
Yeah man,
like little shanty towns.

2179
01:30:15,571 --> 01:30:17,400
But they had cable,
they have electricity.

2180
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:21,630
They caught the TV,
that TV they plugged into.

2181
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,190
They figured out how to plug into 
everything.

2182
01:30:23,191 --> 01:30:26,640
It was all free.
They had pipes that they broke for their

2183
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:29,490
showers that was just constantly running
cold water.

2184
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:32,550
They would take really ice cold showers.
Really?

2185
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,530
Yeah.
They had pets down there.

2186
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,920
When I went down there recently,
it was me,

2187
01:30:37,921 --> 01:30:42,921
this Guy Moses,
and we saw three people the entire time 

2188
01:30:42,921 --> 01:30:44,580
we walked under ground two and a half 
miles to the way out.

2189
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:49,850
I mean when you commit you got to go the
distance and it's two and a half miles 

2190
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:52,671
to get the fuck out or he got to where 
are you going to come back from where 

2191
01:30:52,671 --> 01:30:52,671
you came from?
Duke.

2192
01:30:52,671 --> 01:30:54,630
And we only saw three other people and 
they were explorers to.

2193
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,900
So they were explorers as well.
Yeah,

2194
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,670
checking,
checking that shit out.

2195
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:02,430
So there's a lot of people that go on 
and explore it.

2196
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:03,700
I mean not a lot.

2197
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:06,240
I mean that day there was what,
five of us total.

2198
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,440
So there's.
Yeah,

2199
01:31:07,441 --> 01:31:08,730
that's not big for New York.
Right.

2200
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:12,230
And it's a creepy thing to do though,
isn't it kind of creepy man.

2201
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:16,190
It was cool though.
But the relative to being in the woods,

2202
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:19,440
that stuff that used to be there,
what they do with it all,

2203
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:20,900
they just pulled it all out of there and
yeah,

2204
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:23,270
they cleaned it up yet because Amtrak 
had it and they.

2205
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:24,210
I guess I,
I,

2206
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:29,230
I think that the tunnels weren't being 
used back then or they weren't being 

2207
01:31:29,230 --> 01:31:30,720
used a lot in Amtrak,
one of their fucking tunnel back.

2208
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:32,780
So they kicked all the people out and 
they cleared,

2209
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:35,070
cleaned house,
got all the Shit outta there,

2210
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,760
but there's beautiful artwork down their
murals from these fucking,

2211
01:31:38,761 --> 01:31:43,761
just literally underground artists,
graffiti artists and shit off from the 

2212
01:31:43,761 --> 01:31:44,250
people that lived in there.

2213
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:46,940
Pretty fucking cool stuff because the 
greats,

2214
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:49,200
you know,
where people walk above obviously,

2215
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:54,620
uh,
the light comes through right on the 

2216
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:57,171
wall and every,
every area that has the light coming 

2217
01:31:57,171 --> 01:32:00,471
down,
someone drew something or painting 

2218
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:00,471
something on the walls.
Wow.

2219
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:02,590
And some of the shit is really fucking 
pretty,

2220
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:04,210
pretty good.
That's such a trip.

2221
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:09,450
It's such a trip that they had developed
like a little underground city down 

2222
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:09,450
there.
Fuck yeah.

2223
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:10,700
And a lot of these guys would come up 
during the day to,

2224
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:12,430
to hustle,
you know,

2225
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,140
collect cans and,
you know,

2226
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:15,070
make money,
whatever they,

2227
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,640
however they could.
Or they go through the garbage and get 

2228
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:20,640
their fucking food and then they go back
down.

2229
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:23,320
How long did this go on for?
According to dark days,

2230
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:25,780
they were talking about guys that were 
down there for like two decades.

2231
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:29,040
Jesus Christ said fuck it to,
you know,

2232
01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:32,890
society to society and decide they want 
to live down there,

2233
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,320
but a lot of them were drug addicts and 
crack heads and shit list.

2234
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,290
So many crazy.
But it will in the world,

2235
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:42,160
in the movie a dark days.
Some of the guys would write no crack on

2236
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:44,560
their little homes because they were 
sick of people,

2237
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:47,080
you know,
breaking in or knocking,

2238
01:32:47,081 --> 01:32:48,220
you know,
asking for crack.

2239
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,950
So yeah,
it's hard to get crack in the basement.

2240
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:54,580
It's the whole thing.
So there you go.

2241
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:57,070
I keep forgetting that we could check 
some of this shit out.

2242
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:58,930
Yeah,
it's so strange.

2243
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:00,220
I recommended.
I mean,

2244
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:01,630
I,
I think the,

2245
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,000
I think they could've done a better job 
with this documentary,

2246
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:05,260
but it was,
it was definitely cool.

2247
01:33:05,261 --> 01:33:07,030
Look,
that guy has a dartboard.

2248
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,660
Yeah.
He's got a frigerator behind him.

2249
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:09,930
Yeah.
As a refrigerator.

2250
01:33:09,940 --> 01:33:10,660
It's all,
you know,

2251
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:15,661
free electricity and that's crazy.
And so they just tapped into all the 

2252
01:33:15,661 --> 01:33:16,330
wires and everything.
Yeah.

2253
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:21,390
Wow.
It's really ingenious when it was so 

2254
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:21,970
fascinating how people just find a way 
to adapt.

2255
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:22,700
Right.
You know,

2256
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:25,150
they find a way to adapt to living in 
Siberia.

2257
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:27,940
They find a way to adapt living in the 
fucking tunnels.

2258
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:29,650
Right.
They seemed very,

2259
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:33,040
uh,
very happy down there to that it becomes

2260
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,070
their life.
Yeah.

2261
01:33:34,071 --> 01:33:39,071
And I bet they probably feel like 
they're getting away with not paying 

2262
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:39,160
rent.
And of course it cripples everybody.

2263
01:33:39,161 --> 01:33:40,170
Right.
You're paying rent.

2264
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:42,640
I was creeped out.
I thought I'd see rats down there.

2265
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:43,780
I didn't see any.
And the guy,

2266
01:33:43,781 --> 01:33:45,010
Moses I was with,
he's like,

2267
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:46,960
look,
there's no people down here anymore.

2268
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:49,360
And you know,
rats need people to survive.

2269
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:54,420
So they go to the people that are it 
because rats basically just eat our 

2270
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:54,420
garbage.
I uh,

2271
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:59,460
was on the upper west side once and I 
was at a gas station somewhere on the 

2272
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:02,580
west side and uh,
I uh,

2273
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:06,340
was on the payphone and it's how long 
ago this was and was on the phone and my

2274
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:11,410
car was parked and was getting gas rats 
or jumping out of this sewer,

2275
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:14,620
climbing up my wheel and into the 
wheelhouse.

2276
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:15,220
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2277
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:16,570
yeah.
Just immediately,

2278
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:21,571
like,
right away looking for like whatever 

2279
01:34:21,571 --> 01:34:21,730
fucking a sandwich.
I might've run over and saw the tires.

2280
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:27,050
You're looking for a way into the car 
looking for a way like into the engine 

2281
01:34:27,050 --> 01:34:27,580
compartment.
They sense the heat coming off of it.

2282
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:29,350
I mean,
I saw six,

2283
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:34,370
seven rats climb all over my wheels.
It was discussed and they're highly 

2284
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:34,480
intelligent.
There's so many.

2285
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,260
There's a book out there called rats.
You want to be creeped out to.

2286
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:39,520
Highly intelligent.
Yeah.

2287
01:34:39,521 --> 01:34:41,800
They really are.
And they learn and you know,

2288
01:34:41,801 --> 01:34:44,350
it's really tough to fucking trap them 
and all that shit.

2289
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:49,530
Really.
They understand when you're fucking up 

2290
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:49,530
their environment.
Oh yeah.

2291
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:50,180
That they,
you know,

2292
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,330
they,
they set up all their paths and stuff.

2293
01:34:52,331 --> 01:34:54,040
So you know,
dopey humans go,

2294
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:56,800
oh well I'll put the fucking rat trap 
right where their path is.

2295
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,610
They.
They understand that shit.

2296
01:34:59,950 --> 01:35:02,030
They're fully aware.
Yeah.

2297
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:03,710
Rat traps.
Not enough of those cons.

2298
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,800
No.
We've got to come up with robots at eat 

2299
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,721
rats.
They say there's more rats in New York 

2300
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:10,721
City than people and they s in this 
book,

2301
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:12,470
they said at any given time,
this is,

2302
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,830
this will blow your mind at any given 
time when you're walking around New York

2303
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,420
City,
there's a rat within feet of you.

2304
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,530
Wow.
Because they have all this,

2305
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:22,490
you know,
these tunnels under the sidewalk and all

2306
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:27,491
that shit.
So they dig their own tunnels under the 

2307
01:35:27,491 --> 01:35:27,491
sidewalk.
Love fucking tunnels.

2308
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:33,870
But according to this book,
at any given moment in New York City or 

2309
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:35,930
very close to a rat,
wouldn't that be nice if they had an APP

2310
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:40,931
for that?
So you'd go and you look at your phone 

2311
01:35:40,931 --> 01:35:44,411
like how many rats are near me?
And you look in everywhere and your 

2312
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:47,201
feet.
It's like that scene in aliens when the 

2313
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:47,240
little girl is hiding and the aliens are
coming through the ceiling.

2314
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:52,850
You look all over the ground,
it's like rats are underneath you and 

2315
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:53,030
tunnels everywhere.
I think people would move out.

2316
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:56,360
They wouldn't be so fucking comfy and 
cozy in their upper east side,

2317
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:57,780
you know,
penthouses.

2318
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,290
If you could look down,
you know,

2319
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:04,300
with a,
with a phone and just see all the rats 

2320
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:04,300
moving.
I need to serve as you know,

2321
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,750
uh,
the Plaza Hotel obviously in New York.

2322
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:10,751
Yeah,
I think it was the daily news did an 

2323
01:36:10,751 --> 01:36:10,751
article about the park across the street
is infested with rats.

2324
01:36:10,751 --> 01:36:13,430
And the reason is because the horse,
the horse and carriages,

2325
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:18,520
you know,
they put all the feed down so that shit 

2326
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:19,280
is everywhere.
So it's a great food source for rats.

2327
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:21,680
So I read about it in the,
um,

2328
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:26,860
the paper.
I went there that night and they said 

2329
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,070
you got to wait til the sun goes down.
And sure the fuck there were rats 

2330
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:33,281
everywhere.
Hopping across the fucking lawns and 

2331
01:36:33,281 --> 01:36:33,281
everything.
Did you freak out?

2332
01:36:33,281 --> 01:36:35,720
Sometimes they run like two feet.
What?

2333
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:40,900
Fuck you.
I don't know if it's because they're 

2334
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:40,900
excited.
I have no fucking idea.

2335
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:41,020
Not Not a lot,
but enough to creep you out.

2336
01:36:41,021 --> 01:36:42,280
Like what the fuck?
Rats running.

2337
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,350
Oh yeah.
And then there are people or people were

2338
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:50,351
just kind of sitting on benches and shit
and rats were literally right behind 

2339
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:55,061
them and they didn't know my because I 
was fully aware because the article 

2340
01:36:55,061 --> 01:36:55,460
somebody and they climb on people 
sometimes to just sit in there.

2341
01:36:55,460 --> 01:36:56,150
Any of that,
but.

2342
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,280
But then you also see all the paths 
where the,

2343
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:00,670
where they're coming from.
Yeah.

2344
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:05,770
Fuck paths from one bus to another.
How many didn't think you saw that 

2345
01:37:05,770 --> 01:37:06,200
night?
A couple of dozen probably.

2346
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:07,610
Oh yeah.
They came out man.

2347
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:11,450
And that's probably a tiny fraction of 
how many of them are tiny little park.

2348
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,740
It's like,
I dunno.

2349
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:18,390
Yeah,
it's like maybe four times the space 

2350
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,390
we're in right now.
Let's see.

2351
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,680
Just a small part,
but it was infested.

2352
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:21,470
Sure.
The city hasn't cleaned it up since.

2353
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:24,020
So how do they do something like that?
If you want.

2354
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,400
If you want to check out rats,
go there.

2355
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:27,500
It's across the street from the plaza,
not central park.

2356
01:37:27,501 --> 01:37:30,080
Which is right there too.
How do they keep a rat population?

2357
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,190
Correct.
Does guys that make a shitload of money?

2358
01:37:34,220 --> 01:37:35,630
Just killing rats.
Killing rats.

2359
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:37,250
I totally do.
Yeah.

2360
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,270
These,
these buildings,

2361
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:43,271
they.
They hire the best guys and they make a 

2362
01:37:43,271 --> 01:37:43,271
fortune keeping these buildings red 
free.

2363
01:37:43,271 --> 01:37:45,980
You need cats.
Cats are the way to go.

2364
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:51,350
We,
we cooked up rats on our radio show and 

2365
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,350
you ate it.
You didn't know about that one?

2366
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:56,440
No.
Maybe we did more shit at new than 

2367
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:56,440
satellite.
Really?

2368
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:57,660
Yeah.
One day we got the idea.

2369
01:37:57,661 --> 01:38:02,661
I don't remember why.
Maybe there's some dump cooking show on 

2370
01:38:02,661 --> 01:38:05,120
baby bird.
The bird was the greatest fucking bit 

2371
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:05,120
ever.
Oh,

2372
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,720
and we got to talk about the destroyer 
before I get out of here.

2373
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:09,540
The nickname you gave me,
right?

2374
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:12,180
You were there for probably the greatest
bit we ever did.

2375
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:17,210
Baby Bird.
But let me tell you about the rat thing 

2376
01:38:17,210 --> 01:38:19,260
real fast.
So at new we decided to cook up rats and

2377
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:22,140
we actually got listeners to come in to 
eat rat.

2378
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,150
Wow.
And I looked at Anthony.

2379
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:25,050
I'm like,
there's no way,

2380
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:26,190
but we'll try.
So we,

2381
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:26,970
we,
you know,

2382
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:29,730
we threw the question out there who 
would come in and eat rats,

2383
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,700
phones fucking lit up and people like 
Ali Rats.

2384
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:35,190
So we had two cooks come in.
God,

2385
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:40,250
we had one guy that was a French chef 
and we had just a fucking run of the 

2386
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:44,130
mill barbecue type guy and they,
they both had live rats.

2387
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:46,830
We gave them the live rats and they had 
to do everything else.

2388
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:50,460
And one guy killed the rat,
like very humane.

2389
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,120
He found a spot on the neck or whatever 
and just fucking stabbed the real fast.

2390
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:59,121
The thing was dead in a second,
half a second and the other guy fucking 

2391
01:38:59,121 --> 01:39:02,310
took his bread was just bludgeoning to 
death on the side of the table.

2392
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:05,550
Oh my God killed him because he didn't 
know how else this is on the radio,

2393
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,930
on regular radio.

2394
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,700
Oh my God.
And then the French chef,

2395
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:09,840
uh,
you know,

2396
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:14,841
had a nice recipe and he made like a,
I remember this brown sauce and a nice 

2397
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,720
feel like I was there,
nice presentation and the other guy just

2398
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:23,780
fucking cooked up this bloody mess.
Didn't even just cook the whole thing 

2399
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,000
basically,
but when you know,

2400
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:27,900
the listers came in and they tried the,
the,

2401
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:30,420
the,
especially the one by the French chef,

2402
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:34,230
they went back for seconds.
It went back for seconds.

2403
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:39,530
Well,
not only did they say the store ran or 

2404
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:39,530
was it a street?
Um,

2405
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:43,910
I don't,
I don't remember where we got the 

2406
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:43,910
restaurant and being completely honest 
with you.

2407
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:44,940
I was,
we were trying to get like subway rats,

2408
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,930
but I think we might end up getting them
from a pet store.

2409
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:52,950
So.
But they were big ugly motherfucker 

2410
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,950
things on youtube by the way.

2411
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:55,140
It's under opion is probably full show 
rat eating,

2412
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:56,320
so.
Oh yeah,

2413
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:57,960
check that out.
Wow.

2414
01:39:57,990 --> 01:40:01,080
But then you were there the first time 
we did radio together though,

2415
01:40:01,081 --> 01:40:03,450
I think was in Vegas at the poker 
tournament.

2416
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,360
No,
it wasn't in Vegas.

2417
01:40:04,361 --> 01:40:06,090
It was out here.
It was in California.

2418
01:40:06,300 --> 01:40:06,810
Oh,
and yeah,

2419
01:40:06,811 --> 01:40:08,330
in California.
Was that the first time you're on?

2420
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:11,240
Was Ed asner called you the destroyer?
Well,

2421
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:13,940
yeah.
But then he was at Asbury.

2422
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,750
But then you push that forward.
Well,

2423
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:17,730
you,
you came the first time we did the,

2424
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,980
did radio together.
Uh,

2425
01:40:18,990 --> 01:40:19,860
yes.
Yeah,

2426
01:40:19,861 --> 01:40:20,590
that is.
I didn't,

2427
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:23,820
I didn't really.
I knew of you and your standup obviously

2428
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:24,960
and like I said earlier,
you know,

2429
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:29,961
you support us and we finally got to do 
radio together and Anthony was in the 

2430
01:40:29,961 --> 01:40:29,961
poker tournament.
Yes.

2431
01:40:29,961 --> 01:40:31,320
So I'm like,
Yo Joe,

2432
01:40:31,321 --> 01:40:32,040
you know,
hang out,

2433
01:40:32,041 --> 01:40:32,760
let's do this.

2434
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:35,450
Yeah,
we had a good time and asked her.

2435
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:40,460
Came on.
I mean he had no reason to be on our 

2436
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:40,460
show to be honest with you.
He's a great guy.

2437
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:41,070
He just,
he was all right.

2438
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:44,430
He's you and.
And you started fucking with a full.

2439
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:45,780
No we didn't,
we didn't,

2440
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:47,850
we got along.
But uh,

2441
01:40:47,851 --> 01:40:52,851
I,
I had recently explained this a 

2442
01:40:52,851 --> 01:40:54,250
somewhere that um,
I do that shit just to get a fucking.

2443
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,620
Get a rise out of someone out of you.
Not.

2444
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:58,410
Yeah.
I don't give a fuck about.

2445
01:40:58,411 --> 01:41:03,411
So you,
you went after him to get a rise out of 

2446
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:03,411
them.
That's how fucked up.

2447
01:41:03,411 --> 01:41:07,570
That's fucked up and showmanship.
I did it to superfly Jimmy snuck in the 

2448
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:07,570
other day.
Oh,

2449
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,530
did you really?
Well,

2450
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:13,480
back in 83,
a woman died that he was with and it was

2451
01:41:13,481 --> 01:41:16,360
very suspicious,
very suspicious.

2452
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:18,130
He says she fell on some rocks.

2453
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:23,310
They were driving to a wrestling match 
or something and stopped at a rest area 

2454
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:27,460
and she was checking out a stream and 
she fucking hit her head and then by the

2455
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,710
time we got into the hospital and stuff,
she was dead.

2456
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:32,180
But some say,
yeah,

2457
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:33,580
you might have had something to do with 
it.

2458
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:38,790
Maybe he didn't know.
He imagine if that was actually just as 

2459
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:38,790
girlfriend and you're accusing him of 
killing her and you know,

2460
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:43,830
we got a video,
horrible and it's one of my latest 

2461
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,470
videos on my youtube channel because 
what happened was I,

2462
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,980
we,
we asked him the story which,

2463
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:53,070
which was pretty big because I wasn't 
sure he was going to talk about it and 

2464
01:41:53,070 --> 01:41:54,580
he told the whole fucking story and just
to get a rise out.

2465
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:55,630
Everyone in the room.
I go,

2466
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:57,160
well,
what is she doing now?

2467
01:41:58,660 --> 01:42:03,660
Knowing what,
and look at the reaction I'm getting 

2468
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:08,221
now,
but that's just to get everyone in the 

2469
01:42:08,221 --> 01:42:08,221
room.

2470
01:42:08,221 --> 01:42:10,170
Extremely approachable.
And that's what happened with asthma.

2471
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:12,730
It hasn't,
it didn't do anything to me,

2472
01:42:12,731 --> 01:42:17,731
but for the people that don't know,
a producers started giving me hand 

2473
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:20,230
signals and stuff like he was trying to 
get my attention for something else.

2474
01:42:20,231 --> 01:42:22,630
It might even been where I was at in the
poker tournament.

2475
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,800
And uh,
who,

2476
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:26,500
who said,
what does that mean?

2477
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:31,501
Was it you were at asthma owner about 
what would that hand signals that lead 

2478
01:42:31,501 --> 01:42:31,870
to what I did?
I don't remember.

2479
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,530
Oh,
okay.

2480
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,690
But anyway,
like someone asks like,

2481
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,500
what?
Why is that guy giving,

2482
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,600
you know,
hand signals.

2483
01:42:37,601 --> 01:42:38,170
And I said,
well,

2484
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:42,040
when the guest is boring,
I said this right as there I go with the

2485
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:47,041
guest is boring,
they'd give me you hand signals to get 

2486
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:49,651
them off the fucking air.
And that's what they're called the 

2487
01:42:49,651 --> 01:42:51,340
destroyer.
And for some reason that made you really

2488
01:42:51,341 --> 01:42:51,820
happy.

2489
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:53,980
It was hilarious.
Made you really happy.

2490
01:42:53,981 --> 01:42:56,500
It was fun because you were,
you were fucking with them obviously,

2491
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,090
but it was good nature.
It wasn't that.

2492
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:02,860
But you also got into a fight with a 
poker player that when we were there,

2493
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:08,990
you were there for me.
You mean you're talking about d dot 

2494
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:09,820
Grano?
Yeah.

2495
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:10,720
Yeah.
I didn't.

2496
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:15,470
I didn't really get into an argument.
He just wrote some stuff on his blog.

2497
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,860
We weren't feeling them that day.
We weren't feeling.

2498
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:18,110
Um,
he,

2499
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:21,010
he's a good guy.
Just he misunderstood what I was saying.

2500
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:24,430
He thought that I was talking shit about
his ex girlfriend.

2501
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:27,150
I was not doing that.
I was talking about like what?

2502
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,400
And he realized that he went back and 
looked at the listen to it and actually 

2503
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,670
wrote an apology on his website.
Oh really?

2504
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:34,960
He's a nice guy,
you know,

2505
01:43:34,961 --> 01:43:36,460
I got no problem with.
We didn't,

2506
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:39,580
I don't know.
I was doing radio.

2507
01:43:39,581 --> 01:43:41,980
We were talking about.
It was on Xm,

2508
01:43:41,981 --> 01:43:44,500
so we were talking,
we were having some fun.

2509
01:43:44,580 --> 01:43:49,580
We're having fun.
And then you were the one that 

2510
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:51,220
officially came up with baby bird say is
probably right up there.

2511
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,040
One of our greatest

2512
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,570
beds,
our,

2513
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:54,620
I think bill bird named it.
It was,

2514
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,230
it might've been building.
Said the name baby bird.

2515
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:58,740
Was it your ideas?
My idea.

2516
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,220
I can't take credit for that one.
My idea was,

2517
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:03,150
uh,
we were doing the eggnog contest,

2518
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:06,320
which we no longer can do.
It's illegal now.

2519
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:10,970
Fuck.
Stupid lady died that drinking water?

2520
01:44:11,290 --> 01:44:16,290
Yeah.
We usually shut down spring pat from Iu 

2521
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:16,430
knocky.
They shut down to see what he.

2522
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,640
Were you there the year the guy ate the 
fruit loops with the puke milk?

2523
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:22,340
Yes.
I saw Pat Duffy.

2524
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:24,470
What did he do with that day?
I think pat.

2525
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,000
Yeah.
Well I was there when he did it.

2526
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:29,470
He had pat dot because we brush his 
teeth with dog shit with cat shit.

2527
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:31,280
Shit,
dog shit.

2528
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,400
He's fucking crazy.
He's,

2529
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,960
he's on.
He's on twitter.

2530
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:37,800
Just love Pat Duffy.
I love him too.

2531
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:39,650
But whatever happened to him,
how come he's not working for you guys?

2532
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,620
Because we can't do the stunts anymore.
But we got,

2533
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,540
we got a couple of positions that are 
open.

2534
01:44:44,541 --> 01:44:49,541
So you know,
he wants to interview for depressed the 

2535
01:44:49,541 --> 01:44:50,110
other day.
It sounded so sad.

2536
01:44:50,111 --> 01:44:53,300
So really.
And he called in the Jim Martin show and

2537
01:44:53,301 --> 01:44:55,310
he's just like,
nothing's working for me.

2538
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:57,800
I'm on my last.
It's him.

2539
01:44:57,830 --> 01:45:01,070
He's willing to eat shit.
He did amazing stuff for us,

2540
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:06,071
but he was the one that decided to go 
over the garbage pail when pat from 

2541
01:45:06,071 --> 01:45:10,800
Inaki Start puking from toe.
We knew pat from when Daca was gonna 

2542
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:14,140
Puke.
So what we're trying to figure out what 

2543
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:14,180
would be the most fucked up way to cap 
off this already awesome radio show.

2544
01:45:14,210 --> 01:45:16,100
Which by the way,
we're on regular radio.

2545
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:17,420
Okay.
This was on regular radio,

2546
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:22,421
so we couldn't swear or anything like 
that and me from having doing fear 

2547
01:45:22,421 --> 01:45:22,421
factor.

2548
01:45:22,421 --> 01:45:24,200
It's the only way I would have ever 
thought to do this.

2549
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:27,320
I was like,
how about someone leans over the garbage

2550
01:45:27,321 --> 01:45:31,400
pail and he throws up in their mouth.
I never thought anyone would say yes.

2551
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:34,970
Duffy's fucking stepped right up.
And Pat Duffy stepped up immediately and

2552
01:45:34,971 --> 01:45:35,900
I'm like,
there's no way.

2553
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:40,901
This is really gonna happen.
There's no way it's really going to 

2554
01:45:40,901 --> 01:45:42,881
happen.
And the cartoonishness of the throw up 

2555
01:45:42,881 --> 01:45:46,120
coming out of path will knock you.
The fact that it literally all Eggnog,

2556
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:51,140
yeah,
it was 70 something shots of Eggnog and 

2557
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,710
it was like a broken fire hydrants 
dream.

2558
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,630
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen
in my life,

2559
01:45:56,631 --> 01:46:01,631
the most amazing thing I've ever seen 
because you couldn't imagine there was 

2560
01:46:01,631 --> 01:46:04,970
that much fluid and one guy.
It's just kept going and go in and go,

2561
01:46:04,971 --> 01:46:06,740
and if you haven't seen it,
ladies and gentlemen,

2562
01:46:06,741 --> 01:46:09,160
you deserve to allow you to tow it.

2563
01:46:09,260 --> 01:46:10,860
Youtube took a lot of the,
uh,

2564
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:13,520
videos down with that one.
Well,

2565
01:46:13,521 --> 01:46:16,220
this is from a cell phone.
They let the cell phone version.

2566
01:46:17,250 --> 01:46:20,180
This is all weekend long,
is unbelievable.

2567
01:46:20,181 --> 01:46:23,120
Pat Pat Duffy just sitting there with 
his arms crossed,

2568
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:26,710
relaxed and pat from Menarche,
who is about what?

2569
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,270
300 plus pounds,
gigantic,

2570
01:46:29,271 --> 01:46:34,271
tiny little thin legs and he's got this 
huge gut filled with eggnog and he's 

2571
01:46:35,061 --> 01:46:39,050
ready to blow it all over Pat's face.
And once it goes by the way,

2572
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:43,160
the floor is covered with plastic set up
like a texture cut room.

2573
01:46:43,430 --> 01:46:44,870
They couldn't wait to get us out of 
there.

2574
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,990
They fucking hated it all I'm sure.
Could you imagine?

2575
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,200
I didn't want to deal with these fucking
jazz show

2576
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:55,200
that's on and used that studio,
so I haven't seen this in a while.

2577
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,540
Perhaps Munafiki.
He said this is it.

2578
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:03,950
He's going,
he's 75 position the cameras and 

2579
01:47:04,631 --> 01:47:07,300
everything.
He's such a professional fine.

2580
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:09,520
People that call him from all over 
America.

2581
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:14,200
They've been puking all over the place.
Every city in America.

2582
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:16,060
Yeah,
because other people had already started

2583
01:47:16,061 --> 01:47:17,590
hurling.
They gave up early.

2584
01:47:17,591 --> 01:47:19,420
It was you and Bill Burns studio that 
day.

2585
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,210
Oh,
there it is.

2586
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:28,440
That's happening.
Is happening.

2587
01:47:28,460 --> 01:47:31,920
Oh my God.
That's massive.

2588
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:38,820
How big was that and you think there's 
no way.

2589
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,160
I have seen this video 100 times.
It never gets dumpsters full.

2590
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,200
Seven,
seven and he's not done

2591
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:11,290
gallon each.
How do you explain that?

2592
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:16,610
You can't explain,
but how do you explain how much liquid 

2593
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:19,090
is coming out of his mouth?
There was a massive,

2594
01:48:19,450 --> 01:48:23,650
but how do you explain that?
Like they're massive blast of Linkedin,

2595
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:27,820
so why like rivers coming out of his 
mouth?

2596
01:48:28,270 --> 01:48:31,660
You remember the Stephen King movie 
stand by me with a dude that has the pie

2597
01:48:31,661 --> 01:48:33,520
eating contest.
Bitch.

2598
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:35,540
Literally crazier than that.
Oh yeah.

2599
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:39,850
Literally it doesn't believe.
I don't believe that it came out of it.

2600
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:42,510
Body Pat toffee.
I didn't want.

2601
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:47,660
I did one study where we decided to make
ice cream out of his sister's breast 

2602
01:48:48,881 --> 01:48:51,240
milk,
so and I.

2603
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:56,510
every once in a while I'll step up and 
still do some of these fucking bits and 

2604
01:48:56,510 --> 01:48:57,930
that was one.
For whatever reason I said,

2605
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,630
yeah,
I'll fucking do it.

2606
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,180
Fuck it.
And the ice cream,

2607
01:49:00,181 --> 01:49:05,181
it tasted really good.
He was a first second and then it was 

2608
01:49:05,181 --> 01:49:06,330
the most horrendous tastes you could 
ever imagine.

2609
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:11,510
This.
The Pie eating contest where remember 

2610
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:11,510
that?
Oh yeah.

2611
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:11,510
I mean,
here we are,

2612
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:15,900
right?
Stephen King is such a bad motherfucker.

2613
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:20,550
How many good movies and books is this 
guy right here?

2614
01:49:20,670 --> 01:49:25,670
Yeah.
Trashed us was covered by Pam was what 

2615
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:29,020
was more impressive because that looks 
more fake.

2616
01:49:29,140 --> 01:49:30,800
It did look fake.
You tell them.

2617
01:49:31,230 --> 01:49:31,330
You

2618
01:49:31,330 --> 01:49:32,300
guys.
Yeah.

2619
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:34,010
I don't remember exactly.
Somebody people.

2620
01:49:34,011 --> 01:49:36,530
For what?
Somebody put so many people trashed us.

2621
01:49:36,531 --> 01:49:37,660
You forget.
After a while,

2622
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:42,860
Steven went to them.
I think we went after one of his radio 

2623
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:43,340
stations or one of his morning show,
the October sort of a thing.

2624
01:49:43,341 --> 01:49:46,160
I think someone did.
Someone maybe can help us out.

2625
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,000
Is He recently that did this?
A couple of years back.

2626
01:49:49,150 --> 01:49:51,130
Okay.
Because recently you guys went after one

2627
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:52,480
in Maine.
It was like a Portland,

2628
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:55,890
Maine when I was laughing my ass off.
It was really funny.

2629
01:49:55,910 --> 01:49:57,840
Yeah.
The jock tobar ones are really.

2630
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:01,430
I loved those and I love how they always
shut their facebook pages down,

2631
01:50:01,431 --> 01:50:05,030
like almost immediately the past finding
out about it.

2632
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:07,800
Just take that shit.
But he can take,

2633
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,430
but they take it to the uh,
the,

2634
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,580
the nth degree.

2635
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:15,160
It's Larry.
It's hilarious.

2636
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,240
Yeah.
The past,

2637
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:17,410
uh,
like the,

2638
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:22,600
the most loyal and active radio fans I 
think of any show.

2639
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:27,630
And they also turn on us as well.
I keep us on our toes.

2640
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:28,900
Like,
fuck.

2641
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:30,510
Yeah,
they uh,

2642
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:34,030
they definitely do at the comedy shows.
I know you guys had some.

2643
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:35,980
We,
I went to one of your shows.

2644
01:50:35,981 --> 01:50:37,900
I did one of your shows in Vegas and it 
was great.

2645
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:40,900
It was great.
I know our audience has a,

2646
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:43,810
it has to be said.
They are a great comedy crowd.

2647
01:50:43,870 --> 01:50:46,480
They will sit down and fucking listen,
man.

2648
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:52,140
Show in Philly the infamous show or that
one they did was a hostile.

2649
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:53,150
Yeah,
well they,

2650
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:56,470
they were drinking all day.
We did these comedy shows across America

2651
01:50:56,471 --> 01:51:01,471
and the Philly one is legendary now and 
I feel bad because I know you're close 

2652
01:51:01,471 --> 01:51:02,410
with dom rare,
but he ate his balls that day,

2653
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:05,440
but I've thought about it many times to 
sap went on.

2654
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:07,570
He never had a chance.
He never had a chance to.

2655
01:51:07,571 --> 01:51:12,571
Jimmy Schubert never had a chance.
And Jimmy Schubert actually bombed in 

2656
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:15,580
front of his fucking family that were 
basically sitting in the front row.

2657
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,760
They had to deal with that shit.
Did Jimmy go on first?

2658
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:20,290
Uh,
know Jimmy came close.

2659
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:21,490
I think,
you know,

2660
01:51:21,491 --> 01:51:22,990
I think he went,
who didn't bomb?

2661
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:26,920
Um,
Norton Bill Burr was next.

2662
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:31,120
Bill burr saw what was happening with 
Jimmy Schubert and then and then went on

2663
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:32,140
and shit.
And he goes,

2664
01:51:32,141 --> 01:51:34,210
you know what,
they're fucking not doing this to me.

2665
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:39,270
And at that point,
our audience didn't really know bill 

2666
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:39,270
burr yet,
you know,

2667
01:51:39,270 --> 01:51:41,440
they didn't embrace him yet.
Like other guys that came before bill,

2668
01:51:41,620 --> 01:51:46,620
he was sort of on the cusp of being 
accepted by our big fucking lunatic,

2669
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:48,820
a audience.
And he said,

2670
01:51:48,821 --> 01:51:52,370
I ain't doing that shit to me.
So legendary that,

2671
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:54,170
that,
that clip is out there to.

2672
01:51:54,570 --> 01:51:57,400
We took on the intox fuck the liberty 
bell.

2673
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,760
Yeah.
He went after Philadelphia in a way that

2674
01:52:00,761 --> 01:52:02,590
nobody's ever done before.
And,

2675
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,880
and he,
uh,

2676
01:52:04,090 --> 01:52:06,010
he,
they started booing them.

2677
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,200
By the end of it,
he got a standing ovation.

2678
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:10,480
It was one of the most amazing things 
I've ever seen.

2679
01:52:10,481 --> 01:52:15,481
I know what I'm saying that a lot,
but we're bringing up a lot of 

2680
01:52:15,481 --> 01:52:18,181
benchmarks today.
But that was one of the most amazing 

2681
01:52:18,181 --> 01:52:18,790
things I've ever seen.
A guy turn a fucking room like that.

2682
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,410
Yeah.
That was legit.

2683
01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:22,980
And that bothers me about this video.
This,

2684
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,240
I wish we had a better copy of this.
Yeah.

2685
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:28,690
It's just shitty cell phone video.
It's somebody a uploaded on.

2686
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:29,880
No,
no.

2687
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:35,100
Got It on their cell phone.
Bill Berg started out in Boston and you 

2688
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,450
deal with so many crowds like that 
drunk,

2689
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:42,540
angry,
crazy fucks that you develop that style 

2690
01:52:42,540 --> 01:52:42,640
that,
you know,

2691
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:46,220
that attack style that was a Boston

2692
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:50,120
is Boston set tough for you guys?
Boston's a great place,

2693
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:55,200
but every place to do stand up.
Well as long as you got your shit 

2694
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:55,200
together,
but I mean when you're coming up,

2695
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:56,150
I would imagine it was hard.
Well,

2696
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:57,650
when,
when bill and I came up,

2697
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:00,170
I was a couple of years before him,
but um,

2698
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,850
when we came up there was so many good 
comics around that,

2699
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:08,890
like the rules of the land had been 
pretty much established and there was a 

2700
01:53:08,890 --> 01:53:11,220
lot of really good places to do standing
up.

2701
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:16,230
Right.
But there was also like a lot of like 

2702
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:16,230
really fucked up little shit holes that 
you get sent to Brazil.

2703
01:53:16,230 --> 01:53:17,660
It's so important though.
Of course,

2704
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:22,661
you know,
you can't have like only easy crowds 

2705
01:53:22,661 --> 01:53:22,661
when you're starting out and really 
learn how to do comedy.

2706
01:53:22,661 --> 01:53:24,720
You got to be able to do some hostile 
places.

2707
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:24,840
Right?

2708
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:27,730
So I see like a guy like bill in that 
video,

2709
01:53:27,731 --> 01:53:29,330
it's like,
that's right up bills out.

2710
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:31,030
You get it,
you do stand up in Boston,

2711
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:32,980
you're going to have to deal with it.
You get it.

2712
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,960
I missed those shows.
Were thinking about bringing them back.

2713
01:53:35,961 --> 01:53:36,950
We'll send it back,
man.

2714
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:39,230
It'd be fun.
Maybe this coming summer we'll do one or

2715
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:44,231
two.
You were the guy that need you first 

2716
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:44,231
came up with the name desk squad.
Do you understand that?

2717
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:44,610
That really,
yeah.

2718
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:50,100
Our show or know the name desk was you 
came up with me personally or you did.

2719
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,600
You did.
And he called his dad.

2720
01:53:52,601 --> 01:53:54,170
He didn't make the name up but he called
us.

2721
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:59,171
That's fine.
You don't want to get a little credit 

2722
01:53:59,171 --> 01:54:01,470
here.
Joe is going to be able to have credit.

2723
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,770
Man.
When I showed up I showed up with tate.

2724
01:54:03,770 --> 01:54:05,840
Fletcher was his big giant ultimate 
fighter dude.

2725
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:07,100
And uh,
Eddie Bravo.

2726
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:07,910
Sure.
And you go,

2727
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:09,740
here comes Joe Rogan with the desk.
Okay.

2728
01:54:09,741 --> 01:54:11,840
I do remember that.
And when you did that,

2729
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,900
that literally became the nickname.
We started using it.

2730
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,780
So like all the podcasts that are called
the desk,

2731
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:21,260
it all came out of that one thing.
How do I get a little taste?

2732
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:22,670
What do you want?
What do you want a hug?

2733
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:27,350
I got my money,
I got my taste was out.

2734
01:54:27,370 --> 01:54:29,200
The tastes of that.
That's,

2735
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:31,940
it's tough to get that New York,
New York,

2736
01:54:31,941 --> 01:54:33,890
he gets got some wacky laws.
You know,

2737
01:54:33,891 --> 01:54:35,340
MMA is illegal in New York.
No,

2738
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:40,350
I know.
We can't even do a fuck when we talk 

2739
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:42,431
about that with Dana white all the time.
It's ridiculous what to do with fucking 

2740
01:54:43,971 --> 01:54:47,390
culinary union that they bind people 
off.

2741
01:54:47,450 --> 01:54:48,890
It's amazing.
It's amazing how it works.

2742
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:53,950
But if you're talking about the amount 
of revenue that's being lost in the 

2743
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:53,950
city,
so why can they work around that knowing

2744
01:54:53,950 --> 01:54:56,060
how much money they're losing because 
uh,

2745
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,000
the,
the,

2746
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,860
the industry is set up where the 
influence of these unions,

2747
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:01,670
uh,
is,

2748
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:03,290
uh,
is really been established.

2749
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:05,210
And when they want to keep something 
out,

2750
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:10,330
they spend the money.
They spent a lot of money on anti UFC 

2751
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:11,150
propaganda,
anti UFC websites.

2752
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:16,240
They put out,
they put out press releases and can't 

2753
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:16,640
make money off of say I don't,
I don't understand.

2754
01:55:16,641 --> 01:55:21,641
Here's the airstrip,
break it down to the culinary union is 

2755
01:55:21,641 --> 01:55:23,660
in dispute with the owners of station 
casinos.

2756
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:28,780
Station casinos are a non union 
organization and apparently according to

2757
01:55:29,421 --> 01:55:34,421
station casinos,
the workers in the casinos voted to not 

2758
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:38,051
go union.
They don't want to be involved in human 

2759
01:55:38,051 --> 01:55:40,520
because they don't want to have to pay 
the dues and they believed that the 

2760
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:40,520
company treats them fairly and pays them
well.

2761
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,740
So since they don't want to be in the 
coroner union,

2762
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:44,460
apparently

2763
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,060
this is allegedly.
And you know,

2764
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:49,350
I don't really have any direct 
connection to any of this knowledge.

2765
01:55:49,770 --> 01:55:51,450
This is a lot of hearsay.
Hearsay.

2766
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:56,540
Allegedly.
The Culinary Union would benefit in 

2767
01:55:56,540 --> 01:56:00,410
terms of millions and millions of 
dollars in dues if they got the station 

2768
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:04,641
casinos because I think there's like 20 
station casinos or something crazy like 

2769
01:56:04,641 --> 01:56:06,630
that.
If they got those casinos unionized than

2770
01:56:06,631 --> 01:56:09,000
it would be very financially beneficial 
for them.

2771
01:56:09,001 --> 01:56:14,001
So they have a use lobbyists and they've
used to politicians that they have 

2772
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:18,900
relationships with and people that they 
can pay off to try to keep them in May,

2773
01:56:18,901 --> 01:56:20,940
out of New York.
Man,

2774
01:56:20,941 --> 01:56:25,941
it's amazing.
It's amazing because his millions of 

2775
01:56:25,941 --> 01:56:28,131
people in New York and it's a tiny 
handful of slots that are keeping them 

2776
01:56:28,131 --> 01:56:29,550
in Mayo and it's all financial and it's,
it's made from New York City.

2777
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,920
Can you imagine?
I don't want to talk out of school,

2778
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:35,160
so I don't know what the real details of
their dispute or I don't want to pretend

2779
01:56:35,161 --> 01:56:35,550
that,
you know,

2780
01:56:35,551 --> 01:56:37,980
just because I worked for the UFC that 
they're correct or anybody's career.

2781
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:42,990
Sure.
But it looks to me like some typical 

2782
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:42,990
union goons,
strong arm bullshit,

2783
01:56:42,990 --> 01:56:44,260
you know,
and that's a,

2784
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:45,330
I'm a,
I'm a,

2785
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:46,920
I'm,
I think unions are important.

2786
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:47,970
I'm a fan of unions.
I'm a,

2787
01:56:48,030 --> 01:56:50,700
I'm a fan of people getting paid well 
for,

2788
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:52,050
you know,
for their efforts.

2789
01:56:52,051 --> 01:56:54,030
And I think that there's a lot of merit 
in that,

2790
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:59,360
but when they do stupid shit like this,
I think it ruins it for all the good 

2791
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,500
benefits of the Union code.
They started using themselves as a.

2792
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:06,501
they're like a mob of course,
and they're trying to enforce their own 

2793
01:57:06,501 --> 01:57:07,830
interests and it has nothing to do with 
safety or nothing to do with the public.

2794
01:57:07,831 --> 01:57:12,831
And to see these for horror politicians 
that have been bought off by these 

2795
01:57:12,831 --> 01:57:16,671
people,
to see them lobbying to keep the UFC 

2796
01:57:16,671 --> 01:57:16,671
out.
It's just discussed as standard.

2797
01:57:16,671 --> 01:57:17,640
Getting closer.
I think so.

2798
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:22,670
I think it's A.
There's Joe Rogan Madison Square Garden,

2799
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:25,560
Madison Square Garden calling a UFC 
fucking fight.

2800
01:57:25,561 --> 01:57:26,580
Can you imagine?
Yeah,

2801
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:28,770
I could imagine it.
That'll fuck it.

2802
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:30,000
Freaked out a little bit.
No.

2803
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:32,730
Madison Square Garden now I wouldn't 
know.

2804
01:57:32,890 --> 01:57:36,630
I found from the casino that when you 
guys were all there,

2805
01:57:36,650 --> 01:57:41,650
it wouldn't.
It wouldn't shake me because it's a 

2806
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:41,650
historic building,
but it's at the end of the day,

2807
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:41,760
it's just a building that's true.
You know,

2808
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:46,761
at this,
I mean maybe five years ago would have 

2809
01:57:46,761 --> 01:57:46,761
freaked me out,
or 10 years.

2810
01:57:46,761 --> 01:57:47,390
Is that as.
Look how young you are,

2811
01:57:47,490 --> 01:57:48,530
Brian.
He's a little sweetie.

2812
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:49,560
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2813
01:57:49,640 --> 01:57:51,000
Where is it?
Where are these pictures from?

2814
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:52,080
A.
This is from that casino.

2815
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:53,680
What side of the,
uh,

2816
01:57:53,980 --> 01:57:56,880
this is one of my private sites.
Well fuck man.

2817
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:02,730
And I can send them to you.
So my pictures way back in the day.

2818
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:04,230
Wow.
What year was that?

2819
01:58:04,231 --> 01:58:06,040
Like 2006.

2820
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:08,910
Was it even.
When were you guys,

2821
01:58:08,911 --> 01:58:10,800
when did you guys first get on his,
this guy?

2822
01:58:11,590 --> 01:58:13,590
Two thousand four.
I don't know.

2823
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,970
I know who that is.
He wants to take a guess.

2824
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:20,850
Some famous.
Very famous.

2825
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:22,440
Was that Michael Clarke?
Duncan.

2826
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:25,170
You were looking at a very famous 
athlete.

2827
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:27,110
She said it's Michael Clarke Duncan.
Well,

2828
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:30,090
I can't see it that good.
He's making a crazy face.

2829
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,370
We're looking at a very famous.
It was his name.

2830
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,460
T Dot Deacon Jones.
Oh,

2831
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:36,090
Deacon Jones.
Who was on?

2832
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,690
I think this is 2000 format to them for.
I think we just got on.

2833
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:44,590
When did you start working with me?
I'm 11 years ago,

2834
01:58:44,591 --> 01:58:48,420
10 years ago,
so 2002 while we went to sell it.

2835
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:49,650
Yeah,
it was 2004,

2836
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:51,490
2004.
It was like right after you guys went to

2837
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:52,030
satellite.
Yeah.

2838
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:53,830
We're just starting to get back and 
shit.

2839
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:55,490
Fuck.
Here's the table.

2840
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:57,130
Funny.

2841
01:58:58,950 --> 01:58:59,580
Yeah,
look at that.

2842
01:58:59,581 --> 01:59:02,820
Vos Vos was their boss was there,
so it was me,

2843
01:59:02,821 --> 01:59:03,570
you,
Vasa,

2844
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:08,600
Jimmy,
and it was playing poker that day and 

2845
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:10,821
then Ed Asner,
Steve and I did that just for you 

2846
01:59:10,821 --> 01:59:12,120
fucking guys because he didn't deserve 
it that day.

2847
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:17,270
Boy.
I listened to Vossa and body and 

2848
01:59:17,270 --> 01:59:17,670
Bonnie's a podcast the other night 
driving home.

2849
01:59:17,671 --> 01:59:22,671
It was on your station.
Wanted to fucking throw myself out of 

2850
01:59:22,671 --> 01:59:26,331
the vehicle.
I'm really did hit the gas and kick that

2851
01:59:26,971 --> 01:59:28,330
door.
Open leap.

2852
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:30,210
I don't know if you know what I'm 
saying.

2853
01:59:30,211 --> 01:59:33,000
Is there conflict?
Their concept back and forth conflict.

2854
01:59:33,001 --> 01:59:34,010
It's really fun.
I love it.

2855
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:36,090
It's really fun.
I really love listening to those two.

2856
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:40,230
The main sheet tortures him and she does
and you know what?

2857
01:59:40,290 --> 01:59:43,500
She's smarter than him and that's a bit.
That's a little bit.

2858
01:59:43,890 --> 01:59:48,890
Now Richard's going fucking text me.
She's smarter than him and they're in a 

2859
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:48,890
trap.

2860
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:48,890
You know,
she's,

2861
01:59:48,890 --> 01:59:51,540
she's got them locked up.
Whenever they start going,

2862
01:59:51,570 --> 01:59:53,810
they banter back and forth.
She's always right.

2863
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:59,560
He never went to one fucking trumping 
them over and over again.

2864
01:59:59,671 --> 02:00:00,840
And I'm listening to it.
I'm like,

2865
02:00:00,841 --> 02:00:05,190
I'm going to open this door and I'm 
going to jump this fucking car for rich.

2866
02:00:05,540 --> 02:00:09,450
This is brutal.
It's one of the few podcasts I do listen

2867
02:00:09,451 --> 02:00:10,420
to.
Yeah.

2868
02:00:10,421 --> 02:00:11,010
What,
what,

2869
02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:13,080
um,
what do you have on your show now?

2870
02:00:13,081 --> 02:00:16,350
You and your channel and the weekends.
You have our show,

2871
02:00:16,470 --> 02:00:17,300
our show,
the,

2872
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,870
we call it friends of the show.
It's your friends with Charlotte's.

2873
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:23,970
We call them a Richard Bonnie.
Um,

2874
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:26,940
I think bobby's podcasts out there.
I Dunno.

2875
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:29,280
We mix and match every weekend.
So.

2876
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:34,310
And it's on Saturday and Sunday.
Is that what it is to leave?

2877
02:00:34,311 --> 02:00:36,980
So I don't listen to my channel.
So you guys don't,

2878
02:00:37,010 --> 02:00:39,710
you don't control when your show goes on
because look,

2879
02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:41,910
I love Ron Fez.
Yeah.

2880
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:46,960
But I don't like the fact that when I 
get up in the morning and from driving 

2881
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:46,960
around at 9:00
in the morning,

2882
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,430
I don't hear you guys doing your show.
I hear Ron and Fez.

2883
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:51,530
Well you've got to get the on demand 
thing.

2884
02:00:51,610 --> 02:00:53,240
Yeah.
Yeah.

2885
02:00:53,241 --> 02:00:56,510
But when I'm driving,
I'm driving pretty fucking pot.

2886
02:00:56,511 --> 02:01:01,511
And if what it does is it connects to 
your internet and then you could just 

2887
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:03,650
show,
it sounds like a fake person.

2888
02:01:03,690 --> 02:01:08,690
You could choose.
We had every episode you want and you 

2889
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:09,790
could download tomorrow or yesterday's 
and hit play and it automatically play.

2890
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:12,020
So it's kind of like itunes for Sirius 
Xm.

2891
02:01:12,710 --> 02:01:14,510
Okay.
But can I listen to it today?

2892
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:15,350
Yeah.
Yeah,

2893
02:01:16,190 --> 02:01:18,200
super fast.
I would love for our show to beyond,

2894
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:19,840
of course,
you know,

2895
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:21,740
in the morning drive.
So the archives right away,

2896
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:25,340
I would love to have better,
but do have to have a three g connection

2897
02:01:25,341 --> 02:01:26,660
or some sort of a connection to pick it 
up.

2898
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,460
You always have that connection you 
usually.

2899
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:33,490
But yeah,
you have to have some kind of 

2900
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:33,490
connection,
some kind of connection.

2901
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:33,490
I don't like your voice because the 
satellite,

2902
02:01:33,490 --> 02:01:37,951
I don't have to have a connection 
because I'm connected to the 

2903
02:01:37,951 --> 02:01:37,951
motherfucking sky.
Bridges.

2904
02:01:38,720 --> 02:01:40,110
Storms.
Yeah.

2905
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:41,810
Bridges,
storms or clouds.

2906
02:01:42,650 --> 02:01:44,840
Snow fucks it up as well.
That sure enough,

2907
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:49,130
you ever get like direct TV snows out 
fucking worse.

2908
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:54,160
Good luck.
Why then you wish you had cable and you 

2909
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:56,111
pissed.
I don't know if I like the pure coconut 

2910
02:01:56,111 --> 02:01:58,301
water.
You guys got a lot of freaky stuff 

2911
02:01:58,301 --> 02:01:58,301
around here.
Coconut water.

2912
02:01:58,301 --> 02:01:58,860
It's very freaky.
I'm surprised it's a brain.

2913
02:01:58,870 --> 02:02:00,230
You're talking about.
How's coconut water?

2914
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:01,760
Freaky,
freaky,

2915
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:08,620
freaky shit.
I guess maybe I'm not describing it 

2916
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:08,930
perfectly,
but you got a new mood thing over there.

2917
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,200
You got fucking Alpha brain over here 
with freaky PPO.

2918
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:14,900
I'm drinking pure coconut water.
It's very good for you.

2919
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:16,420
Which I know is very good,
but I don't.

2920
02:02:16,421 --> 02:02:17,660
I don't.
I don't know.

2921
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:20,990
I don't like it was surrounding you with
like organic items.

2922
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:26,030
Wood and brick and and coffee made with 
butter it together,

2923
02:02:26,440 --> 02:02:28,040
Bro.
Coffee made with butter.

2924
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:31,220
It's bulletproof coffee.
It's fed butter.

2925
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:34,370
I know it's one of your sponsors.
Mycotoxin free coffee.

2926
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:35,620
I say that with love.
I know,

2927
02:02:35,621 --> 02:02:37,670
I know.
It's not even one of my sponsors.

2928
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:40,400
I think I've heard you talk about it.
We sell it on on it,

2929
02:02:40,401 --> 02:02:42,980
but they're not a sponsor on.
It's one of our sponsors.

2930
02:02:42,981 --> 02:02:47,981
We started selling bulletproof coffee 
because it's so good that the key is 

2931
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,700
trying to find coffee.
That's like.

2932
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:51,890
It has very little mold in it.
You remember?

2933
02:02:51,930 --> 02:02:56,930
You can treat it too with coconut oil.
You ever have this starbucks coffee 

2934
02:02:56,930 --> 02:02:57,290
where it's like the fucking really good 
shit.

2935
02:02:57,350 --> 02:03:00,140
Only a few starbucks a it.
What is it?

2936
02:03:00,890 --> 02:03:04,500
It's Kinda like um,
what I remember they have a.

2937
02:03:04,501 --> 02:03:09,501
I think you even told me about this,
that some starbucks have this million 

2938
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:10,520
dollar coffee maker machine.
Yeah.

2939
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:15,521
The others are machine guy made the.
He was a coffee freak and he made this 

2940
02:03:16,131 --> 02:03:20,450
machine that bruise the beans to the 
perfect temperature and all that shit.

2941
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:22,850
Starbucks experimenting with that in 
Boston.

2942
02:03:22,851 --> 02:03:26,570
You get a cup of coffee?
I actually had it on a.

2943
02:03:26,840 --> 02:03:28,100
What is it?
Boylston street again?

2944
02:03:28,101 --> 02:03:29,200
Yeah.
Is it Boylston?

2945
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:30,500
Down Boylston.
Boston.

2946
02:03:30,501 --> 02:03:32,600
Is that where the finish line for the 
marathon is?

2947
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:34,220
What road is that?
I don't know,

2948
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:35,690
I,
my roads fucked up.

2949
02:03:35,691 --> 02:03:37,700
I'm not a little man.
It goes around and running.

2950
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:39,050
No,
he never ran.

2951
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:41,260
I do run,
but I'm not to race.

2952
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:44,550
Let's see.
Who actually was.

2953
02:03:44,551 --> 02:03:46,490
I was just teasing.
I was good.

2954
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:48,140
Nothing wrong with running.
Anyway.

2955
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:49,850
They were running 20 miles without 
stopping.

2956
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:51,110
No,
let's do that.

2957
02:03:51,590 --> 02:03:54,640
Why would I do that?
Just get in the car just so he could say

2958
02:03:54,641 --> 02:03:59,641
that this year.
But there's a starbucks over there in 

2959
02:03:59,641 --> 02:04:00,740
Boston and it's like seven or eight 
bucks for one cup of coffee.

2960
02:04:00,860 --> 02:04:03,050
So I had to try it.
It was amazing.

2961
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:05,840
Is it the type of bean as wells as 
special,

2962
02:04:06,510 --> 02:04:11,510
like fucking blue or green something.
Fucking coffee beans.

2963
02:04:11,961 --> 02:04:16,240
And they brew individual cups of coffee 
and it takes a whole thing and it's like

2964
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:21,300
Kinda,
it's almost like a pizza pie tray and 

2965
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:21,300
it's a,
it's a whole thing.

2966
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:26,111
Your watch it being made the most 
expensive coffee or drinking something 

2967
02:04:26,111 --> 02:04:28,310
called Kopi Luwak.
No idea what it is.

2968
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:33,311
It's um,
it's coffee beans that are eaten by an 

2969
02:04:33,311 --> 02:04:36,551
animal called a civet right.
And it shits it out and when it hits it 

2970
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:37,440
out,
the coffee beans are not digested by its

2971
02:04:37,450 --> 02:04:38,070
body,
but

2972
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:39,510
it's bodies,
acids,

2973
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:44,570
stomach acid,
do something to break down the outer 

2974
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:44,570
area,
that outer heart area.

2975
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:48,270
And then when you brew those beans it's 
unbelievably smooth and delicious.

2976
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:50,880
And it doesn't taste like shit.
Someone has to say it.

2977
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:53,250
Sorry.
No,

2978
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:58,430
I guess they clean it.
Just fucking drain the beans a little 

2979
02:04:58,430 --> 02:04:58,770
bit.
They cleaned the shit.

2980
02:04:58,771 --> 02:05:00,150
I try that.
It's good.

2981
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:02,110
I'm telling you it's delicious.
Where he gets a different.

2982
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,800
You're going to specialty stores to get 
an order online.

2983
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:07,080
But the fact that someone likes coffee 
so much,

2984
02:05:07,081 --> 02:05:08,640
they picked it out.
A pilot shit.

2985
02:05:08,641 --> 02:05:11,430
No kidding.
This little cunty fucking civic.

2986
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:13,050
And you know,
they had been.

2987
02:05:13,230 --> 02:05:14,700
Someone had to try it for the first 
time.

2988
02:05:14,760 --> 02:05:15,840
Yeah,
we'll think about it.

2989
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,640
Anything that people have eaten yet?
We've,

2990
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:19,970
we've lobsters and shit.
Someone had to go,

2991
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:21,690
you know,
I think that might be tasty.

2992
02:05:21,900 --> 02:05:25,270
They had to give it a shot and they.
But I think at this stuff they,

2993
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:27,100
they tried like,
you know,

2994
02:05:27,120 --> 02:05:29,450
someone had to try poison ivy.
Yeah.

2995
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:34,580
Oh yeah,
but the eight that they had to try all 

2996
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:34,580
that shit.
Then we finally said,

2997
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:34,580
no,
leave that shit alone.

2998
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,460
Yeah.
It's funny how some plants are delicious

2999
02:05:38,461 --> 02:05:43,461
for you and other plants will kill you 
immediately and they all like sorta had 

3000
02:05:43,461 --> 02:05:48,440
someone had a fucking figure that shit 
out for us that they've all been 

3001
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:48,440
documented.
It's essentially into.

3002
02:05:48,440 --> 02:05:53,230
Except for like the rain forest,
there's they don't know what the fuck's 

3003
02:05:53,230 --> 02:05:56,481
in there and you deal with like the 
gigantic vast reaches of the Amazon and 

3004
02:05:57,151 --> 02:05:59,820
how many plants are in there that we 
don't even know about this.

3005
02:06:00,060 --> 02:06:05,060
It's very possible they send botness 
down there all the time and they 

3006
02:06:05,060 --> 02:06:05,060
discover new shit and we're just fucking
destroying.

3007
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:08,650
Tell us it's no big fucking deal.
Well,

3008
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:10,420
the.
Where's it Borneo?

3009
02:06:10,460 --> 02:06:12,420
Was it born here?
They keep finding new species.

3010
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:17,421
They've been funding a bunch of new 
species and then like tropical rain 

3011
02:06:17,421 --> 02:06:18,600
forest,
new species of primates,

3012
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:21,720
new species of bugs and these species of
birds.

3013
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:27,140
It's like they're constantly finding all
these weird freaky fucking animals they 

3014
02:06:27,140 --> 02:06:30,681
didn't even know existed and it's 2013.
We do not have a good inventory of all 

3015
02:06:31,591 --> 02:06:33,510
the life on earth.
We got most of it though.

3016
02:06:34,070 --> 02:06:35,100
Not Big.
Todd.

3017
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:37,190
Todd.
I don't know.

3018
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:42,840
What about lochness monster?
I think that's most likely horseshit or 

3019
02:06:42,840 --> 02:06:44,930
it could be a just a big fish or an 
eagle has to be you.

3020
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:48,870
Now they've been.
They've been looking around enough.

3021
02:06:48,930 --> 02:06:50,840
Well then that didn't know.
Just look around enough.

3022
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:55,560
They've actually trolled the sonars know
that and they thought it was a place.

3023
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:57,120
Yes.
Or I think,

3024
02:06:57,550 --> 02:07:00,480
but if I'm not mistaken,
I don't think that animal breeze water.

3025
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:03,240
I think that animal is supposed to be an
air breathing thing.

3026
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:04,380
Like a whale,
you know,

3027
02:07:04,381 --> 02:07:06,390
that kind of situation.
Yeah.

3028
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:08,040
And it's like.
I don't know though,

3029
02:07:08,100 --> 02:07:09,930
I don't know if they do,
they breathe the water,

3030
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:13,320
but I just don't think that a dinosaur 
could be alive today.

3031
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:15,810
It just doesn't make sense to me.
But how cool would that be?

3032
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:17,490
It would be pretty fucking cool.
That'd be cool.

3033
02:07:17,491 --> 02:07:19,350
Right.
You think will bring dinosaurs back?

3034
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:25,100
Yeah,
I think they're going to do that 

3035
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:26,361
eventually.
We're going to start doing some of that 

3036
02:07:26,361 --> 02:07:28,221
shit.
I couldn't imagine them not because 

3037
02:07:28,221 --> 02:07:28,560
they're already talking about mammoth.
I think there's some Russian.

3038
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:30,400
They're getting close scientists 
figuring that out.

3039
02:07:30,410 --> 02:07:32,310
I just think either they're very close 
to,

3040
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:33,450
but they've only been extinct.

3041
02:07:33,450 --> 02:07:35,350
How many years?
13,000.

3042
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:37,000
I was going to say somewhere in the 
pleistocene.

3043
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:42,100
Somewhere around the.
That's nothing compared to fucking 

3044
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:42,100
dinosaurs.
Yeah.

3045
02:07:42,100 --> 02:07:42,120
They don't know.
Uh,

3046
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:47,150
they,
they think that they might have been 

3047
02:07:47,150 --> 02:07:47,530
killed the same way they think that a 
lot of speculation as to what killed off

3048
02:07:47,531 --> 02:07:52,531
the woolly mammoth,
but they think the woolly mammoth and 

3049
02:07:52,531 --> 02:07:52,531
the tooth tiger might've been killed off
by meteors.

3050
02:07:52,531 --> 02:07:53,170
Really?
Yeah.

3051
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:54,110
They think that,
um,

3052
02:07:54,490 --> 02:07:55,000
the,
uh,

3053
02:07:55,001 --> 02:08:00,001
the decline of the last ice age,
like the abruptness might've might've 

3054
02:08:00,001 --> 02:08:04,801
been started or triggered initially by 
meteor showers because they found that 

3055
02:08:04,801 --> 02:08:07,060
about,
I think 12,000

3056
02:08:07,061 --> 02:08:08,710
years ago.
And the Strada,

3057
02:08:08,711 --> 02:08:11,050
when they do like coil soil samples,
you know,

3058
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:16,830
12,000
years ago they found this type of glass 

3059
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:18,310
that exists at nuclear test sites in on 
meteor impact sites.

3060
02:08:18,790 --> 02:08:21,810
And it's everywhere all over the earth.
So they,

3061
02:08:21,811 --> 02:08:24,760
they found in all sorts of different 
countries and it's all in the same area,

3062
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:30,120
so they're pretty sure that that's what 
happened and they think that that 

3063
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:30,430
might've coincided with a lot of mass 
extinctions,

3064
02:08:30,431 --> 02:08:34,540
including like the wooly mammoths and 
saber tooth tigers because they found,

3065
02:08:34,541 --> 02:08:39,541
they found some areas really interesting
areas where they found like a lot of 

3066
02:08:39,541 --> 02:08:42,841
bullying,
mammoth skeletons all together in one 

3067
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:42,841
place.

3068
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:42,841
Like they all died together.
I don't know,

3069
02:08:42,841 --> 02:08:44,890
you know,
I tell what kind of classes that they're

3070
02:08:44,891 --> 02:08:46,700
fighting impact glass.
It's like,

3071
02:08:46,710 --> 02:08:48,460
what does it look like?
It's like greenish.

3072
02:08:48,490 --> 02:08:49,250
It's really kind of,
what is it,

3073
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:54,350
like big huge pieces.
I don't think it's microscopic the 

3074
02:08:54,350 --> 02:08:54,600
scopic unless,
I mean,

3075
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:56,140
I don't want to say microscopic,
it's the wrong word.

3076
02:08:56,170 --> 02:08:58,060
I think it's,
it varies in size,

3077
02:08:58,061 --> 02:09:01,440
but some of it is small pieces that they
just find that's pretty cool in the uh,

3078
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:03,040
well let me,
let me find it like,

3079
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:07,660
so I can answer your question,
but impact glass glass 12,000

3080
02:09:07,661 --> 02:09:09,610
years.
Um,

3081
02:09:09,611 --> 02:09:14,611
yeah.
It's fascinating shit because what 

3082
02:09:14,611 --> 02:09:17,071
they're saying essentially is that it's 
most likely that if something like that 

3083
02:09:17,071 --> 02:09:21,841
did happen,
a lot of people died and then it 

3084
02:09:21,841 --> 02:09:21,841
might've killed off a huge percentage of
our population,

3085
02:09:21,841 --> 02:09:26,821
but it's so long ago that the stories 
about it,

3086
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:30,220
that the fables,
everything that was if there was writing

3087
02:09:30,221 --> 02:09:31,750
back then everything that was written 
down,

3088
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:32,200
it's gone.

3089
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:35,110
It's long gone and it's my.
It might be very well that the amount of

3090
02:09:35,111 --> 02:09:40,111
civilization that we had back then was 
like we were on our way to developing a 

3091
02:09:40,111 --> 02:09:43,351
civilization,
but it's pretty remote and pre pretty 

3092
02:09:43,351 --> 02:09:45,530
crude and then it got reset and then we 
had to start all over again.

3093
02:09:45,531 --> 02:09:50,531
You think it was crude?
Might be if there's a lot of highly 

3094
02:09:51,581 --> 02:09:55,150
intelligent beings before us.
Sure.

3095
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:57,430
It's possible.
It's just as no evidence of it.

3096
02:09:57,460 --> 02:09:58,120
True.
What?

3097
02:09:58,150 --> 02:10:00,520
What have you found new evidence 
somewhere and you found out?

3098
02:10:00,521 --> 02:10:05,521
Well in Greenland,
there's an alien ship that came here 

3099
02:10:05,521 --> 02:10:08,911
from another fucking planet.
They found it in the ground and they 

3100
02:10:08,911 --> 02:10:08,911
found all this alien fossils and they 
had a whole city set up here.

3101
02:10:08,911 --> 02:10:10,270
One hundred million years ago,
you'd be like,

3102
02:10:10,271 --> 02:10:11,500
Whoa,
no shit.

3103
02:10:11,501 --> 02:10:12,110
You would.
Yeah,

3104
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:14,100
I mean,
but until they find something like that,

3105
02:10:14,101 --> 02:10:15,610
you just talking to your ass,
you know.

3106
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:17,160
Well,
that's what I said about bigfoot.

3107
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:18,990
Said that about bigfoot.
Right?

3108
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:22,390
You're right.
Except I defer to that lady that,

3109
02:10:22,391 --> 02:10:23,290
uh,
that late.

3110
02:10:23,300 --> 02:10:28,300
Yeah,
she knows a little bit more Jane 

3111
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:28,300
Goodall's.
She's a bad bitch.

3112
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:28,360
She knows what the fuck she's talking 
about.

3113
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:31,240
But then again,
that could be just her super excited.

3114
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:36,570
The melt glass at 1700 degrees equal to 
an atomic bomb.

3115
02:10:37,140 --> 02:10:38,670
Meteorites are thought to have 
triggered,

3116
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:42,660
triggered a cold snap that killed off 
every civil early civilization and giant

3117
02:10:42,661 --> 02:10:43,590
animals.
Yeah.

3118
02:10:43,710 --> 02:10:45,960
This is what they're thinking.
Evidence of this media rights,

3119
02:10:45,961 --> 02:10:47,820
intense heat was found on two 
continents.

3120
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Researchers believed the huge,
huge cosmic impact triggered a vicious 

3121
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,320
cold snap which caused widespread 
destruction.

3122
02:10:55,350 --> 02:10:58,470
The international team found a substance
known as melt glass,

3123
02:10:58,680 --> 02:11:01,560
which forms the temperatures of 17 whoa.

3124
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:07,960
Seventeen to 100 degrees to 2,200
degrees Celsius and can result in a 

3125
02:11:10,941 --> 02:11:14,360
cosmic body hitting the earth.
So that's what it's is a result from.

3126
02:11:14,361 --> 02:11:16,640
So they think that that's like one of 
the leading.

3127
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:17,570
Oh,
it's big man.

3128
02:11:17,571 --> 02:11:19,820
They have big pieces of the shit.
I thought it was small,

3129
02:11:19,821 --> 02:11:20,390
but look,
it's big.

3130
02:11:20,391 --> 02:11:22,850
It's in this case,
it doesn't look like glass though.

3131
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:23,990
Yeah,
it's weird.

3132
02:11:24,470 --> 02:11:26,290
It's created by it.
Well,

3133
02:11:26,291 --> 02:11:28,460
it does here more.
It looks like,

3134
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:33,520
like melted glass right out.
You can just looking at sort of a weird 

3135
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:34,510
picture.
But um,

3136
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:40,270
there's a,
there's a thing called the clovis 

3137
02:11:40,270 --> 02:11:42,320
comment and uh,
that's uh,

3138
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:42,820
uh,

3139
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:45,690
a comment that they're,
uh,

3140
02:11:45,700 --> 02:11:48,470
an impact site that they,
they were uh,

3141
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:53,740
researching too.
They're trying to figure out is around 

3142
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:53,740
the same,
same time around 12,000

3143
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,810
years ago.
They think that uh,

3144
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:59,920
that might've coincided with a lot of 
the or might have rather been the source

3145
02:12:00,351 --> 02:12:04,040
of a lot of the stories of cataclysms 
and like the old texts,

3146
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:09,370
like the Sumerian texts and you know,
in the ancient stories from the original

3147
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:14,891
Hebrew Bible,
like a lot of those cataclysmic stories 

3148
02:12:14,891 --> 02:12:17,501
might've had something to do with it.
Retelling of the days of the impacts of 

3149
02:12:17,501 --> 02:12:17,770
the meaning,
the showers.

3150
02:12:18,360 --> 02:12:20,710
Were you bored in school?
Yeah,

3151
02:12:20,711 --> 02:12:21,630
I was pretty bored.
Yeah,

3152
02:12:21,710 --> 02:12:23,670
because they weren't teaching this shit.
Well,

3153
02:12:23,671 --> 02:12:24,410
they were,
you know,

3154
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:29,470
the problem with school is they're just 
trying to get you to conform to sitting 

3155
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:31,160
in a chair and absorbing information,
doing what they asked you to do,

3156
02:12:31,161 --> 02:12:32,380
all that,
you know,

3157
02:12:32,390 --> 02:12:33,620
when you're,
you got a kid.

3158
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:38,920
The way to get a kid excited about 
learning is to get them excited about 

3159
02:12:38,920 --> 02:12:39,380
learning something that he's interested 
in of course.

3160
02:12:39,381 --> 02:12:42,310
And then once they do that.
Yeah.

3161
02:12:44,530 --> 02:12:49,250
And then once you do that then you know,
learning becomes fun for most of us.

3162
02:12:49,251 --> 02:12:51,230
Learning became a bore,
a burden.

3163
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:52,020
It's A.
Yeah.

3164
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:54,830
So I had to kind of relearn what 
learning meant.

3165
02:12:54,890 --> 02:12:56,930
Now,
how you handle that with your kids?

3166
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,630
In what way?
How were they learning?

3167
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:01,580
Just traditional school.
Yeah.

3168
02:13:01,581 --> 02:13:02,300
Um,
but,

3169
02:13:02,301 --> 02:13:02,750
uh,
I mean,

3170
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:07,751
are they having a good time with it or 
are they going through the same shit we 

3171
02:13:07,751 --> 02:13:08,440
did growing up because my kids are still
too young.

3172
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:11,680
They're the start that next year.
I guess the,

3173
02:13:11,730 --> 02:13:16,730
the,
the four year old is in preschool right 

3174
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:19,631
now and it's fascinating to watch them 
first start to interact with their 

3175
02:13:19,631 --> 02:13:23,231
little friends and they're just starting
to learn things and they're learning 

3176
02:13:23,231 --> 02:13:25,850
things and it's fun.
And what's really interesting to me is I

3177
02:13:25,851 --> 02:13:29,060
was watching the other day and they're 
teaching this class and you know,

3178
02:13:29,061 --> 02:13:30,530
they're,
they're teaching them stuff and they get

3179
02:13:30,531 --> 02:13:31,980
excited when they raise their hand and 
they

3180
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,720
figured out and they're right and they 
all like laughing and having fun.

3181
02:13:34,721 --> 02:13:39,630
I'm a lot happens where this stops being
fun.

3182
02:13:39,730 --> 02:13:44,730
Like how does this become the gross snus
that is nonchalant high school teachers 

3183
02:13:45,691 --> 02:13:47,610
who don't give a fuck and kids in the 
class.

3184
02:13:47,611 --> 02:13:52,611
I don't give a fuck and everybody seems 
to be misguided and lost and ready to 

3185
02:13:52,611 --> 02:13:54,050
fucking just get out of there and break 
free.

3186
02:13:54,440 --> 02:13:57,370
I got to answer the first,
the first day they gave you homework.

3187
02:13:58,420 --> 02:14:01,290
I said it though,
I don't think you should do homework.

3188
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:02,290
I agree with you.
Well,

3189
02:14:02,430 --> 02:14:07,430
school was absolutely fun until they 
started fucking giving you homework and 

3190
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:08,250
if and,
and it was busy work.

3191
02:14:08,580 --> 02:14:11,820
Most of that shit was busy work and if 
it did,

3192
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:12,790
it looked,
you know,

3193
02:14:12,850 --> 02:14:16,900
only you can only focus on certain,
you know,

3194
02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:19,690
like one thing or whatever.
Whatever your,

3195
02:14:19,730 --> 02:14:24,730
your subjects already,
you're really trying to gather 

3196
02:14:24,730 --> 02:14:24,730
information on.

3197
02:14:24,730 --> 02:14:27,250
You can only focus on them for a certain
amount of amount of hours in the death 

3198
02:14:27,250 --> 02:14:30,830
course.
Otherwise you're going to lose the 

3199
02:14:30,830 --> 02:14:33,051
absorption and when you force kids into 
like getting home and then working out 

3200
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:38,780
what about the rest of their life,
you're going to make an imbalanced 

3201
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:38,780
person,
right?

3202
02:14:38,780 --> 02:14:41,110
If you're going to school eight hours a 
day after that,

3203
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:46,200
that should be good enough.
Should be an eight hours doing anything 

3204
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:46,290
a day should be good enough.
It's ridiculous.

3205
02:14:46,291 --> 02:14:48,420
You're not going to get it.
I'm going to handle that.

3206
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:53,480
My son is almost three at preschool next
year in the fall and I don't know.

3207
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:55,470
I don't.
I don't know how.

3208
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:57,460
What are your thoughts on the way to,
you know,

3209
02:14:57,820 --> 02:15:02,820
I mean obviously you made a living in a 
very controversial and I'm a unusual way

3210
02:15:04,250 --> 02:15:05,850
by,
by becoming a radio guy,

3211
02:15:05,851 --> 02:15:08,030
like very few people make it as a radio 
guy,

3212
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,400
so like mean a lot of parents,
they're big scare.

3213
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:15,480
The big fear is what if my son or 
daughter becomes a loser?

3214
02:15:15,520 --> 02:15:18,180
Right?
What if I fail to get them ready for the

3215
02:15:18,181 --> 02:15:23,181
real world?
And then they're out there and they 

3216
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:23,181
become like this big burden.
So then when they hear something like,

3217
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:24,690
hey mom,
I want to be a radio DJ.

3218
02:15:24,970 --> 02:15:25,980
No son,
don't,

3219
02:15:25,981 --> 02:15:30,981
you know,
it's hard to make it in the radio 

3220
02:15:30,981 --> 02:15:32,961
business.
The retail business has one of the 

3221
02:15:32,961 --> 02:15:32,961
smallest rates of success of any 
business in America.

3222
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:34,080
Why?
Why do that?

3223
02:15:34,081 --> 02:15:37,500
Or do you go work with your funder and 
stocks and bonds and mom,

3224
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:38,700
my dad said,
go for it.

3225
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:41,100
Well then your dad's a good guy.
He was an amazing guy.

3226
02:15:41,101 --> 02:15:42,570
Yeah,
he absolutely.

3227
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,730
He told me from a very young age,
he said,

3228
02:15:44,731 --> 02:15:49,731
look,
find something you really enjoy because 

3229
02:15:49,731 --> 02:15:49,731
you're gonna.
Have to do it for a long fucking time.

3230
02:15:49,731 --> 02:15:52,050
He didn't give a fuck if he wore a suit 
or if we,

3231
02:15:52,090 --> 02:15:53,460
you know,
try to be a radio guy.

3232
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,690
And he supported me.
He supported me every step of the way.

3233
02:15:57,750 --> 02:16:00,810
That's awesome.
And it's funny you say what you just did

3234
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:05,430
because I remember my friends were so 
fucking jealous of me because I was able

3235
02:16:05,431 --> 02:16:08,910
to go for my dream and they want to go 
for the same fucking dream,

3236
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:13,911
but they had the parents that you just 
marked where they basically said there 

3237
02:16:13,911 --> 02:16:18,111
was like five careers that were the hot 
careers back then and they've basically 

3238
02:16:18,111 --> 02:16:21,240
forced their kids to go to college to 
get a job with one of those areas.

3239
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:23,670
Yeah.
It was the safest route.

3240
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:25,050
And those,
those guys,

3241
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:27,240
they're miserable.
They're absolutely miserable.

3242
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:32,720
Yeah.
And then you're fucked because stuck on 

3243
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:32,720
that path.
There's nothing he could do.

3244
02:16:32,720 --> 02:16:32,890
You get the mortgage,
you got the wife,

3245
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:34,330
you've got the kids,
you've got the job.

3246
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:39,330
That's a good job.
Like what are you gonna quit this good 

3247
02:16:39,330 --> 02:16:39,330
job and then how are you going to live?
We're going to do.

3248
02:16:39,330 --> 02:16:42,651
You're going to be a musician now.
Really not your time to be a musician 

3249
02:16:42,651 --> 02:16:43,330
was when you were 20.
And to be fair,

3250
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:45,730
my dad always said have something to 
fall back on.

3251
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:49,180
Like he was aware that the odds were 
against me,

3252
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:50,080
but he's like,
you know,

3253
02:16:50,081 --> 02:16:52,330
make sure that you have something to 
fall back on.

3254
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:55,090
Which I never really did.
I just Kinda,

3255
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:57,880
I was either going to do that and just 
be a bomb or something I think.

3256
02:16:58,180 --> 02:17:01,510
But as far as my kid goes,
I just want him to just try every.

3257
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:03,100
Everything,
whatever he enjoys.

3258
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:04,930
Right.
Pursuing enjoys.

3259
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:07,120
I always say that if there's a guy out 
there,

3260
02:17:07,121 --> 02:17:09,280
anybody out there that's making comic 
books,

3261
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:11,110
you can make comic books too.

3262
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:16,170
Okay.
If there's a guy out there who's making 

3263
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:16,170
movies you can make movies to.
You're a person.

3264
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:16,660
You've got to figure out what he's 
doing.

3265
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:18,280
I'm not saying you're going to figure it
out.

3266
02:17:18,430 --> 02:17:20,710
You might not be able to figure it out,
but if it was so easy to do,

3267
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:21,990
everybody be doing it.
Okay,

3268
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:24,490
but if someone's doing it,
it can be done,

3269
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:25,360
right?
It doesn't.

3270
02:17:25,361 --> 02:17:28,120
You know,
you have to figure out and along the way

3271
02:17:28,210 --> 02:17:30,730
you learned about yourself and you learn
about getting shit done.

3272
02:17:31,210 --> 02:17:33,100
You learned about making things happen.
Of course,

3273
02:17:33,101 --> 02:17:38,101
that's what people don't learn when they
take the safe route and they save the 

3274
02:17:38,101 --> 02:17:38,101
take that safe route,
they,

3275
02:17:38,101 --> 02:17:39,670
they don't learn about making shit 
happen.

3276
02:17:39,890 --> 02:17:44,890
It'll learn about the thrill of carving 
a life out of something that's like a 

3277
02:17:44,890 --> 02:17:47,380
really difficult business like the radio
business,

3278
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,810
like you've got to kick back at the end 
of the day and go,

3279
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:50,560
hey,
fuck it.

3280
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:55,590
I'm opie from opie and Anthony.
It's one of the biggest radio teams in 

3281
02:17:55,590 --> 02:17:56,530
the history of the business.
A 10 year period.

3282
02:17:56,531 --> 02:17:58,860
At the end of the day,
there's no one can take that away.

3283
02:17:59,470 --> 02:18:01,420
That's pretty fucked up.
It's fucking awesome.

3284
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:03,220
That's the only thing I've done in my 
whole life,

3285
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:04,480
but it's good.
Eighteen years old,

3286
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:06,940
but it's great.
And to think about how few of them,

3287
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:12,120
how few people who get into radio ever 
get to be an opening and a few people 

3288
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:12,280
get to be on a show like opie and 
Anthony,

3289
02:18:12,430 --> 02:18:14,800
a few,
and they were scared to take the chance.

3290
02:18:14,801 --> 02:18:19,801
So you can understand why your parents 
would be reluctant to try to encourage 

3291
02:18:20,471 --> 02:18:23,290
you to do that kind of a dream.
If you don't want your kid to be a loser

3292
02:18:23,291 --> 02:18:25,150
and you see something like radio,
you're like,

3293
02:18:25,151 --> 02:18:26,440
ah,
it's fucking kid.

3294
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:31,800
I wonder what.
I wonder what they really thought were 

3295
02:18:31,800 --> 02:18:32,230
they weren't talking to me when I was 
away doing this fucking thing.

3296
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,550
I wonder if they,
you know,

3297
02:18:34,090 --> 02:18:36,070
I wonder if they had conversations like,
oh fuck,

3298
02:18:36,071 --> 02:18:37,510
I hope he gives up on that.
You know,

3299
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:42,600
fortunately one of these days,
my parents didn't have any influence on 

3300
02:18:42,600 --> 02:18:43,540
me by the time I was 21.
There's nothing they could say.

3301
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:46,360
I was so stubborn like I have.
When I had it in my mind,

3302
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:47,530
I was like,
it didn't matter to me.

3303
02:18:47,531 --> 02:18:49,960
So when I started doing standup comedy,
my mother was like,

3304
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:54,990
wow,
I never really thought you were that 

3305
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:54,990
funny.
I don't think.

3306
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:54,990
Yeah,
my mom didn't think I was funny at all.

3307
02:18:54,990 --> 02:18:55,530
I think,
uh,

3308
02:18:55,910 --> 02:18:57,580
I,
I never looked back at 18.

3309
02:18:57,910 --> 02:18:58,570
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3310
02:18:58,571 --> 02:18:59,640
I,
I came from a,

3311
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:01,540
you know,
kind of a strange upbringing.

3312
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:06,600
My mom was fucking mentally insane and I
knew I had to get the fuck out of there.

3313
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:10,390
So when all those stories about your dad
and the gambling,

3314
02:19:10,900 --> 02:19:12,880
gambling,
you know.

3315
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:13,720
Fuck.
Was that,

3316
02:19:13,770 --> 02:19:14,910
I don't know.
No,

3317
02:19:14,911 --> 02:19:15,250
no,
no.

3318
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:16,420
My Dad wasn't a gambler.
No,

3319
02:19:16,421 --> 02:19:18,190
I'm sorry,
I confused you with somebody else.

3320
02:19:18,191 --> 02:19:19,600
Who the fuck that I confuse you with?

3321
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:23,060
Oh no,
that sounds like a good story.

3322
02:19:23,990 --> 02:19:24,650
Shit.

3323
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:26,940
God dammit.
All right,

3324
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:28,010
forget it.
So

3325
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,530
now I need to know your mom was nutty.
Oh yeah.

3326
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:35,880
Yeah.
Do you feel like you have any of that 

3327
02:19:35,880 --> 02:19:35,880
nutty sauce working around your brain?
I'm sure we all do.

3328
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,000
Not like,
not like she had.

3329
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:39,400
No.
She had,

3330
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:42,020
she was dying.
She diagnosed with OCD,

3331
02:19:42,021 --> 02:19:45,200
but she's scared all sorts of shit going
on now.

3332
02:19:45,201 --> 02:19:47,300
What would they do for it today?
If it went today?

3333
02:19:47,301 --> 02:19:49,210
They would hook her on Medicaid.
Yeah,

3334
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:51,030
but I mean the pills that come a long 
way,

3335
02:19:51,031 --> 02:19:52,970
you know,
but back in the day,

3336
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:54,530
man.
Holy Fuck.

3337
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,730
Yeah.
If you were stuck,

3338
02:19:55,731 --> 02:19:58,070
if your mother had a mental illness back
in the day,

3339
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,430
nobody did anything about it.
They're not.

3340
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:01,280
They didn't have any results.
She went away.

3341
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:05,000
She would go away to mental hospitals 
and as kids we were like,

3342
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:05,780
where's mom?
Oh,

3343
02:20:05,781 --> 02:20:08,420
she's visiting like a long lost fucking 
relative.

3344
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:10,490
Oh,
she would be gone for a week or two at a

3345
02:20:10,491 --> 02:20:10,880
time.

3346
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,980
Yeah.
And they did.

3347
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:14,800
They did the electric shock treatment 
back then,

3348
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:18,380
the bad kind a,
they've been able to pinpoint that shit.

3349
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:19,800
So when they do give you,
let's recap,

3350
02:20:19,910 --> 02:20:20,990
now they,
they kinda,

3351
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:26,470
they understand a little better,
but back then they were just frying the 

3352
02:20:26,470 --> 02:20:26,510
whole fucking brand and hoping they 
returning some shit off.

3353
02:20:28,380 --> 02:20:33,380
Oh yeah.
What's really interesting when you look 

3354
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:35,561
at like respected peer reviewed medical 
journals from like the 16 hundreds and 

3355
02:20:36,290 --> 02:20:39,840
shed thought you could love bottom eyes 
people.

3356
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:42,060
Totally cool thing to do.
Man.

3357
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:44,360
I don't know what year it was where they
lobotomized people,

3358
02:20:44,361 --> 02:20:47,780
but I'm making the number up,
but whenever they used to do it,

3359
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:50,120
like you know,
they thought that was the way to do it.

3360
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:55,150
Right?
Like this is a good middle of fucking 

3361
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:56,990
stick in there and scrambling,
put some day they're going to look at 

3362
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:58,430
the shit we're doing today and going 
into these idiots back then thought this

3363
02:20:58,431 --> 02:20:59,180
was the right thing.

3364
02:20:59,210 --> 02:20:59,780
Oh yeah.
Like,

3365
02:20:59,781 --> 02:21:01,130
you know,
artificial hips,

3366
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:06,370
artificial hips tweaked me out.
Like I can see when someone needs them 

3367
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:06,370
and you know,
you gotta do what you gotTa do,

3368
02:21:06,370 --> 02:21:09,470
but I know in a few years they're going 
to be able to regenerate a hip.

3369
02:21:09,500 --> 02:21:12,440
Of course they're going to be able to 
figure out to do some really nutty shit.

3370
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:15,590
They built a woman's bladder.
They made a fake bladder.

3371
02:21:16,010 --> 02:21:17,720
Yeah.
They built it in a fucking.

3372
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:19,470
I Dunno how it built it,
right?

3373
02:21:19,530 --> 02:21:24,530
Do you use some sort of tissue from her 
skin and constructed a bladder one and 

3374
02:21:25,061 --> 02:21:28,210
then put it in her body didn't work.
I don't know.

3375
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:30,350
This is a test.
Her urine.

3376
02:21:32,890 --> 02:21:36,680
I don't drink other people's urine,
just my own.

3377
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:39,730
I don't even drink my own anymore.
I tried it a few times.

3378
02:21:39,731 --> 02:21:41,030
I tried.
It's not that bad.

3379
02:21:41,330 --> 02:21:42,860
It wasn't bad.
Yeah,

3380
02:21:43,380 --> 02:21:44,690
it was.
Yeah.

3381
02:21:44,691 --> 02:21:49,691
It's one of those things where you can 
survive on a boat if you drink your 

3382
02:21:49,691 --> 02:21:51,930
urine or you could die of dehydration.
Let's see.

3383
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:55,670
Fucking pussy.
You know what I'm saying?

3384
02:21:55,730 --> 02:21:59,450
I hear you saying that as a father you'd
be able to kill a deer if your kids were

3385
02:21:59,451 --> 02:22:01,220
hungry and you knew that's what you had 
to do.

3386
02:22:01,490 --> 02:22:06,490
Brewer.
Brewer told me the greatest thing about 

3387
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:06,490
being a father when he goes,
when you become a father,

3388
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:09,500
you completely understand that you could
kill another human being.

3389
02:22:09,550 --> 02:22:11,600
Oh yeah.
I didn't understand that.

3390
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:14,540
My wife was pregnant at the time and I 
was hanging out with her and you know,

3391
02:22:14,541 --> 02:22:17,210
you get all this advice from all your 
friends and that's what he told me.

3392
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,520
Had Boys at the fucking truth,
man.

3393
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:20,330
Oh,
it's totally.

3394
02:22:20,550 --> 02:22:23,180
Yeah.
I'm a lunatic father at the playgrounds.

3395
02:22:23,330 --> 02:22:28,330
Are you?
You a little kid watching my son's 

3396
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:28,330
coming down the slide.
Oh No,

3397
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:29,070
not that bad,
but there was a,

3398
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:33,030
there was a girl that pushed my son 
right into a pole bad and I had a little

3399
02:22:33,031 --> 02:22:33,930
girl.
My Shit.

3400
02:22:33,990 --> 02:22:36,090
Well she was bigger than my son,
but still,

3401
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,110
what,
three or four?

3402
02:22:37,111 --> 02:22:39,510
He was probably a year and a half at the
time was a little girl,

3403
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,940
uh,
a yelled in,

3404
02:22:41,941 --> 02:22:44,070
like,
just like in general,

3405
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:49,490
but the kid was pretty damn scared out 
of my mind because the parent wasn't 

3406
02:22:49,490 --> 02:22:49,490
around.
I was like,

3407
02:22:49,490 --> 02:22:51,870
who's I started screaming,
starts screaming,

3408
02:22:51,871 --> 02:22:56,490
who's fucking kid is fine because my kid
is like,

3409
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,860
you know,
when you see your kid cry,

3410
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,120
it's brutal,
right?

3411
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:01,110
Yeah.
It's pretty brutal.

3412
02:23:01,340 --> 02:23:01,990
I mean,
you know,

3413
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:04,260
I've learned since then you've got to be
a little cooler about it.

3414
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:08,310
But I lost my fucking,
my shit because she went right at him,

3415
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:10,260
you know,
he was being an innocent little kid.

3416
02:23:10,261 --> 02:23:13,080
Just kind of like shadow playing with 
them and following them around.

3417
02:23:13,470 --> 02:23:16,860
She turned around and gave him a shove.
He went flying to this poll.

3418
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:20,250
I thought he was fucked up to say that 
most kids that do that,

3419
02:23:20,251 --> 02:23:23,010
like physical kind of stuff,
it's because that's happening to them.

3420
02:23:23,410 --> 02:23:23,950
Uh,
no.

3421
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:26,520
Yeah.
Well we all know kids are sponges,

3422
02:23:26,521 --> 02:23:27,300
right?
Yeah.

3423
02:23:27,301 --> 02:23:30,210
They say when kids react violently,
like out of,

3424
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,070
out of sort like that.
I kind of believe that.

3425
02:23:32,180 --> 02:23:37,180
Yeah.
I noticed the most kids are passive 

3426
02:23:37,180 --> 02:23:38,310
aggressive assholes.
You go to the playground with your kids.

3427
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,960
Oh yeah.
How do you handle it?

3428
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,950
I just let him play.
And you let him get like thrown out.

3429
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:45,750
I have a two and a half year old and I 
have a four and a half year old,

3430
02:23:45,780 --> 02:23:47,340
so four and a half year old.

3431
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:49,410
I've watched her lose a little bit more 
distance,

3432
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:51,800
but the two and a half year old I 
mirrored her.

3433
02:23:52,450 --> 02:23:54,600
I'm there.
I'm her shadow wherever she goes.

3434
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:59,660
No,
I let I let my kid get roughed up a 

3435
02:23:59,660 --> 02:23:59,660
little bit,
but not that,

3436
02:23:59,660 --> 02:23:59,660
you know,
being pushed into.

3437
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:01,170
Well,
it just doesn't seem very necessary.

3438
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:03,030
Yeah,
I would definitely say something,

3439
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:05,310
but it wasn't really badly hurt.
Yeah.

3440
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:07,130
I'm trying not to scream,
you know,

3441
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,090
but it's hard when you're even 
embarrassed.

3442
02:24:09,120 --> 02:24:12,960
I lost it and then some parents came up,
but it wasn't her kid.

3443
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:18,320
It was like a friend of the,
of the parent that was watching the kid 

3444
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:18,960
and she's trying to go at me and I'm 
like,

3445
02:24:18,990 --> 02:24:23,990
look,
you don't even know what the fuck she 

3446
02:24:23,990 --> 02:24:24,510
did.
Was she saying because I'm yelling,

3447
02:24:24,750 --> 02:24:26,250
so she thinks I'm yelling at her kid.
I'm like,

3448
02:24:26,251 --> 02:24:28,050
I'm technically not yelling at your kid.

3449
02:24:28,050 --> 02:24:29,940
Um,
I am losing it because as you see,

3450
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:33,290
my kid is screaming over here and yeah.
And I,

3451
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:38,370
and I go,
you don't even know what the fuck 

3452
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:38,370
happened?
I said,

3453
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:38,370
fuck right.
I go,

3454
02:24:38,370 --> 02:24:39,310
well,
do you were,

3455
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,950
were you,
you weren't watching your kid.

3456
02:24:41,530 --> 02:24:43,080
Uh,
yeah.

3457
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:48,110
People get real defensive.
It's very emotional when you're dealing 

3458
02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:50,040
with children and injuries and shit.
And when you,

3459
02:24:50,041 --> 02:24:55,041
um,
when you like see how fucking wacky the 

3460
02:24:55,041 --> 02:24:56,100
world is getting,
do you worry about the future?

3461
02:24:56,101 --> 02:24:59,040
Each other fucking mean you guys as part
of your show,

3462
02:24:59,080 --> 02:25:04,080
you're constantly covering everything 
that's fucked up about the world and 

3463
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:05,400
this constant stories.
And it's brutal.

3464
02:25:05,790 --> 02:25:06,550
Yeah.
I,

3465
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:09,060
I kinda liked the days where I just had 
to worry about myself.

3466
02:25:09,660 --> 02:25:10,600
Yeah.
I also,

3467
02:25:11,130 --> 02:25:16,130
I also know that I will absolutely take 
one before my kid does.

3468
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:19,860
Right.
I know I will jump in front of a car and

3469
02:25:19,861 --> 02:25:21,510
all that shit now.
Well obviously,

3470
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:23,000
yeah,
that we hope it doesn't.

3471
02:25:23,470 --> 02:25:23,980
Course

3472
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:25,540
I did all that shit,
you know,

3473
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,340
plays into it being a father.
You're like,

3474
02:25:27,341 --> 02:25:32,341
oh my God,
this is all stuff I've never had to 

3475
02:25:32,341 --> 02:25:33,220
think about or worry about.
This world is beautiful in certain spots

3476
02:25:33,221 --> 02:25:38,221
for certain amounts of time.
And the key is trying to take those 

3477
02:25:38,221 --> 02:25:40,240
certain spots where it's beautiful for 
certain amounts of time,

3478
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:42,310
extended amount of time and spread out 
the spots.

3479
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:44,680
Nice.
You know that that really is.

3480
02:25:44,740 --> 02:25:49,740
I mean,
think about obviously we all like 

3481
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:49,740
people,
right?

3482
02:25:49,740 --> 02:25:50,200
And we all love people.
We all love people.

3483
02:25:50,260 --> 02:25:50,820
You know,
there's,

3484
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:53,380
we all have really good friends.
We all have family,

3485
02:25:53,381 --> 02:25:56,110
we all have people that we enjoy seeing 
in movies.

3486
02:25:56,680 --> 02:25:59,980
The key is to bring everybody else into 
that,

3487
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:02,850
like sort of a,
an environment like this.

3488
02:26:02,890 --> 02:26:05,110
This idea that we need constant 
conflict,

3489
02:26:05,650 --> 02:26:10,650
I think that's all,
some outdated ape shit and I think that 

3490
02:26:10,650 --> 02:26:14,101
that needs to be looked over and move 
forward and it can be managed and done 

3491
02:26:14,101 --> 02:26:14,860
with conflict.

3492
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:16,600
Yeah.
It's so stupid after awhile.

3493
02:26:18,110 --> 02:26:23,110
I mean the,
the fact that every fucking day in the 

3494
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:24,550
news we're talking about going into some
new country and there's some new,

3495
02:26:24,850 --> 02:26:27,070
uh,
al Qaeda strong point.

3496
02:26:27,071 --> 02:26:29,650
Did you hear about that shit?
This is some new talking point.

3497
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:30,910
Oh really?
Oh yeah.

3498
02:26:30,911 --> 02:26:34,960
They'll have an island and like Malley,
there's some place called molly.

3499
02:26:34,961 --> 02:26:36,580
Where's molly?
Do you know where Melia?

3500
02:26:37,330 --> 02:26:38,200
Brian,
anyone?

3501
02:26:38,201 --> 02:26:43,090
Malley Malley.
Google manage silly goose.

3502
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:45,730
It's mally mal.
I.

3503
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:48,160
So this is the.
Somebody sent me this tweet,

3504
02:26:48,161 --> 02:26:50,950
I don't know how correct he as he says,
al Qaeda moves to mally.

3505
02:26:50,951 --> 02:26:54,700
Just so happens molly has gold and 
mineral deposits of course.

3506
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:56,440
Oops.
Which is hilarious.

3507
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:57,430
So,
uh,

3508
02:26:57,700 --> 02:27:02,700
out in the headline in the world,
news on Yahoo is al Qaeda carves out own

3509
02:27:02,981 --> 02:27:06,550
country in Mali that al Qaeda has its 
own country.

3510
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:08,170
All of a sudden,
all of a sudden,

3511
02:27:08,650 --> 02:27:11,710
deep inside caves and remote desert 
basis,

3512
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:14,410
it sounds like you're reading something 
from the fucking 19 fifties.

3513
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:16,500
When it was propaganda films,
he'd been sad.

3514
02:27:16,720 --> 02:27:21,720
This is how it actually starts on Yahoo 
knows yahoo news deep inside caves and 

3515
02:27:21,720 --> 02:27:26,230
remote desert basis in the scarp mints.
It's an escarpment.

3516
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:30,190
The escarpments and cliff faces of 
northern Mallee,

3517
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:35,370
Islamic extremist fighters have been 
burrowing into the earth erecting a 

3518
02:27:35,681 --> 02:27:40,681
formidable set of defenses to protect 
what is essentially become our titus 

3519
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:43,830
newest country.
Africa.

3520
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:46,540
They got,
they got a layer that is,

3521
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:51,580
it sounds like they're living in the 
middle of a mountain that is Wacko 

3522
02:27:51,580 --> 02:27:52,030
propaganda.
When did that,

3523
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:54,130
a couple of days ago?
Um,

3524
02:27:54,190 --> 02:27:59,190
I think it's today.
I think it's Today's news I haven't 

3525
02:27:59,190 --> 02:27:59,190
really checked into 10 hours ago 
apparently.

3526
02:27:59,190 --> 02:28:00,040
I mean,
I don't know if that's true.

3527
02:28:00,070 --> 02:28:01,360
Maybe it is true.
Maybe there really isn't.

3528
02:28:01,361 --> 02:28:03,310
Al Qaeda has a fucking country all of a 
sudden there.

3529
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:03,910
You know,
I haven't,

3530
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:06,460
I haven't turned on CNN,
Fox,

3531
02:28:06,461 --> 02:28:08,320
MSNBC,
and like two or three days.

3532
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:13,320
It's kind of Nice.
It seems like the government wrote that 

3533
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:16,051
though,
I can't believe that a journalist wrote 

3534
02:28:16,051 --> 02:28:16,051
that the way this is written,
it's almost like the government said,

3535
02:28:16,051 --> 02:28:20,911
here go like this.
It's almost like the government hired 

3536
02:28:20,911 --> 02:28:23,461
some gay guy hiding from the fact that 
he's gay and he's very creative and he 

3537
02:28:24,621 --> 02:28:27,480
writes and he has a boyfriend,
but no one can know,

3538
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:30,530
and so he writes this kind of shit for 
them.

3539
02:28:30,531 --> 02:28:31,880
They pull him aside and say,
listen,

3540
02:28:32,360 --> 02:28:37,360
we need something that really gets 
people excited about us going over to 

3541
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:41,081
molly and taken over that gold,
so do what you gotta do and you have a 

3542
02:28:41,081 --> 02:28:45,091
fancy little typewriter and say hi to 
your boyfriend for me in this gay dudes 

3543
02:28:45,091 --> 02:28:46,100
sweating it out,
drinking bourbon.

3544
02:28:46,550 --> 02:28:51,550
Lincoln is glass together.
This is what one side King Center 

3545
02:28:51,550 --> 02:28:53,370
imagination you got in the escarpments 
carpets.

3546
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:58,500
Escarpments is this phrase only a gay 
man uses only a gay man under the 

3547
02:28:58,500 --> 02:29:03,401
influence of alcohol is trying to come 
off as being a little bit more literate 

3548
02:29:03,401 --> 02:29:05,420
and verbose in his scarp mints and cliff
faces,

3549
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:09,530
northern Mallee,
Islamic extremist fighters,

3550
02:29:09,531 --> 02:29:12,440
Islamic extremists fighter.
That's Kinda scary.

3551
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:17,500
I've been barreling into the earth.
You have a picture of these fucking 

3552
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:17,500
people.
Please.

3553
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:18,740
Can I at least see one of them satellite
photos?

3554
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:19,820
Do you ever leak

3555
02:29:20,780 --> 02:29:22,100
a leak in what?
I got to take it.

3556
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:22,930
A leak.
Oh yeah.

3557
02:29:22,931 --> 02:29:23,650
Go take a leak,
man.

3558
02:29:23,710 --> 02:29:24,700
Go ahead.
I can handle it.

3559
02:29:25,210 --> 02:29:26,830
I have a fucking powerful bladder

3560
02:29:27,830 --> 02:29:30,620
drinking coffee the whole fucking time.
Like I told you.

3561
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:32,270
Oh,
I got a powerful bladder.

3562
02:29:32,540 --> 02:29:34,710
How much time do we have left on this 
program?

3563
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,610
It's like not even 5:00.
Twenty minutes.

3564
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:40,250
We almost did three hours.
Ope already.

3565
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:41,350
That's pretty good.
Crazy.

3566
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,590
I think.
I think we did good.

3567
02:29:42,591 --> 02:29:44,460
Then you want to wrap it up right now?
No,

3568
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:46,310
I don't care.
You go take a leak and then come back.

3569
02:29:46,490 --> 02:29:47,570
We'll talk about some other shit.

3570
02:29:48,270 --> 02:29:50,550
Opie took notes.
It's a fucking goddamn professional.

3571
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:56,930
He knows what he's doing.
It's the most professional out of all 

3572
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:56,930
the radio guys we've ever had on the 
show.

3573
02:29:56,930 --> 02:29:57,750
One of the radio guys we had on the 
show,

3574
02:29:58,850 --> 02:30:02,960
so Norton Norton's comic as well.
We need to get tom like on.

3575
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:05,300
I know Kevin Smith back on.
Yeah,

3576
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:07,290
we need to get to,
I got to do his show next.

3577
02:30:07,291 --> 02:30:09,060
I owe him one,
but then he'll do ours,

3578
02:30:09,330 --> 02:30:13,050
but we have to do it that way because I 
did him first and then he did us.

3579
02:30:13,110 --> 02:30:15,990
That's why I'm io,
but I'll do it and then a,

3580
02:30:16,280 --> 02:30:17,100
they'll do us again.

3581
02:30:17,730 --> 02:30:17,900
Hm.

3582
02:30:19,020 --> 02:30:20,140
It's a big swap off.

3583
02:30:22,280 --> 02:30:24,020
But uh,
we got a lot of good guys coming up.

3584
02:30:24,110 --> 02:30:26,130
We're going to do what David Cho with,
uh,

3585
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:28,100
with Yoshi.
He's coming up soon.

3586
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:34,420
We got a Dunkin,
most likely it's going to be here 

3587
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:36,050
tomorrow,
but a Dunkin is undergoing a,

3588
02:30:36,350 --> 02:30:38,810
his first doses of chemo,
so.

3589
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:40,330
Oh No.
Yeah.

3590
02:30:40,520 --> 02:30:42,110
So He's,
he's very optimistic though.

3591
02:30:42,111 --> 02:30:46,560
The type of cancer that he had his 
papers to the trouble.

3592
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:47,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3593
02:30:47,121 --> 02:30:49,010
He has to do a,
a version of it.

3594
02:30:49,140 --> 02:30:52,880
I don't know exactly how it works.
He'll uh,

3595
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:54,980
he'll explain it to us because it's 
pretty interesting.

3596
02:30:55,080 --> 02:31:00,080
Like he was,
he was explaining to me on the phone 

3597
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:00,080
today they,
uh,

3598
02:31:00,080 --> 02:31:02,090
this particular type of cancer,
testicular cancer,

3599
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:07,790
a lot of research has been done and 
apparently they're very good at nabbing 

3600
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:07,790
it,
stopping it.

3601
02:31:07,850 --> 02:31:09,600
And a very good at,
you know,

3602
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:12,350
bringing people back to being cancer 
free.

3603
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:14,510
Scary Shit though.
Scary Shit.

3604
02:31:14,511 --> 02:31:15,740
When a friend has something like that,

3605
02:31:16,030 --> 02:31:17,680
you should check out the movie 50 slash 
50.

3606
02:31:17,681 --> 02:31:20,000
It deals with seth and then

3607
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,750
the guy from looper and stuff and I just
watched it the other day.

3608
02:31:22,751 --> 02:31:25,600
It's on Netflix and it was kind of 
interesting to watch,

3609
02:31:25,630 --> 02:31:27,820
you know,
like a young kid getting this cancer and

3610
02:31:27,821 --> 02:31:30,430
having to do like the cancer,
stuff like that.

3611
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:36,110
I went on a date with a girl once she.
She died of cancer when I wanted a day 

3612
02:31:36,110 --> 02:31:38,220
with her.
She was already suffering from cancer.

3613
02:31:38,221 --> 02:31:42,480
When my friend hooked us up together,
we went on like this double date.

3614
02:31:42,870 --> 02:31:44,370
She was very nice,
very nice.

3615
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:50,420
She had something like,
I think she had her lymph nodes already 

3616
02:31:50,420 --> 02:31:50,420
removed.
She had some,

3617
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:53,700
some,
some issue like her neck had like a scar

3618
02:31:53,701 --> 02:31:58,701
on it and she wore a scar to cover up 
this a scarf rather to cover up the 

3619
02:31:58,701 --> 02:32:03,351
scar.
She was very pretty and very smart and 

3620
02:32:03,351 --> 02:32:03,351
very nice and like so vibrant and full 
of life.

3621
02:32:03,351 --> 02:32:08,030
She was such a fun person,
was hard to believe that she was on her 

3622
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:09,270
way out the door and then within a year 
she was,

3623
02:32:09,390 --> 02:32:10,940
she was gone.
Oh yeah.

3624
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,030
It was really weird,
man.

3625
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:13,160
But uh,
you know,

3626
02:32:13,170 --> 02:32:15,900
my friend was like,
would you mind going on this double date

3627
02:32:16,050 --> 02:32:16,670
with,
uh,

3628
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,340
with my,
uh,

3629
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:19,860
my girlfriend's friend?

3630
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:20,580
And I said,
yeah,

3631
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:21,420
sure why?
He goes,

3632
02:32:21,620 --> 02:32:23,250
but I gotta tell you something,
she's dying of cancer.

3633
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:25,440
And it was like,
oh,

3634
02:32:25,441 --> 02:32:27,450
okay.
So I go,

3635
02:32:27,451 --> 02:32:28,980
okay,
that's a tough sell for me.

3636
02:32:29,420 --> 02:32:31,950
She was a tough sell for anywhere she 
was.

3637
02:32:32,250 --> 02:32:34,320
She was alive.
She was,

3638
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:39,370
if she did wind up dying of cancer,
but the night that we went and hung out 

3639
02:32:39,431 --> 02:32:43,620
and she was very alive and she was 
laughing and happy and it was weird.

3640
02:32:43,621 --> 02:32:46,830
It was weird to know that I was saying 
that she had already had an operation.

3641
02:32:46,831 --> 02:32:49,320
She wore a scarf because she had a big 
scar on her neck,

3642
02:32:49,321 --> 02:32:51,300
something.
She had something removed from her neck,

3643
02:32:51,600 --> 02:32:53,910
but she was still like really pretty and
really fun.

3644
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:58,140
And she was only 27 or 28 I think.
And then how long ago was this?

3645
02:32:58,230 --> 02:32:59,230
Long Time?
A long,

3646
02:32:59,260 --> 02:33:00,180
long,
long time ago.

3647
02:33:00,180 --> 02:33:04,350
It was in the nineties and she died.
It was crazy.

3648
02:33:04,351 --> 02:33:09,351
You know,
it's weird to think that your body can 

3649
02:33:09,351 --> 02:33:12,261
just go wacky on Ya.
And literally your body starts growing 

3650
02:33:12,541 --> 02:33:14,460
shit that's not supposed to be growing 
there.

3651
02:33:14,461 --> 02:33:17,640
And it enters into your system.
And then before you know it,

3652
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:19,680
you've got a real problem and 
everything's shutting down.

3653
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,540
Just going to check out.
Horrible.

3654
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:22,620
Yeah,
that's,

3655
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:23,760
that's great.
Joe.

3656
02:33:24,070 --> 02:33:25,920
Um,
I went to the bathroom.

3657
02:33:25,921 --> 02:33:30,921
What the hell happened?
I heard through the grape vine that a,

3658
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:36,260
you,
there's a video out of you being on top 

3659
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:38,940
of the fucking Chrysler building or 
something.

3660
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:40,650
Is this,
is this true?

3661
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:46,040
Did you,
did you get into the bowels of the 

3662
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:48,351
Chrysler building with some fucking 
nutty dude and he climbed up on top of 

3663
02:33:48,351 --> 02:33:49,440
the roof and you got like a video of 
this.

3664
02:33:50,310 --> 02:33:52,290
Is that possible?
Or there's no video.

3665
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:54,390
There's no video.
There's no video out,

3666
02:33:54,480 --> 02:33:56,040
there's no video out.
It hurts.

3667
02:33:56,150 --> 02:34:01,150
Well,
the rumor is you heard through the 

3668
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:01,150
grapevine.
The rumor is that,

3669
02:34:01,150 --> 02:34:01,580
I don't know.
I'm,

3670
02:34:01,650 --> 02:34:03,480
I want to say anything,
I'll just tell you what I've heard.

3671
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:07,620
Rumor is that you have a video that you 
were there personally,

3672
02:34:07,830 --> 02:34:12,830
while some fucking lunatic was climbing 
out onto the actual eagles that overhang

3673
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:20,380
on the Chrysler building,
so he's literally walking around on this

3674
02:34:20,381 --> 02:34:23,080
metal that is not designed to carry a 
fucking grown man.

3675
02:34:23,081 --> 02:34:24,190
By the way.
Imagine that.

3676
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:26,950
Metal would be slippery.
Slippery as fuck.

3677
02:34:26,951 --> 02:34:31,951
He's got street shoes on and he's 
standing on top of this thing and it's 

3678
02:34:31,951 --> 02:34:36,331
how many floors you're seeing this.
How many floors is it might be 60 

3679
02:34:36,331 --> 02:34:36,760
stories.
Jesus,

3680
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:40,750
fuck that guy's nuts.
Not seen this.

3681
02:34:40,751 --> 02:34:45,751
Huh?
I've heard this is what I heard is what 

3682
02:34:45,751 --> 02:34:45,751
I've heard.

3683
02:34:45,751 --> 02:34:45,751
Is it true?
Is it gets really windy up there.

3684
02:34:45,751 --> 02:34:46,870
Is it real?
How do you.

3685
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:49,430
How do you get there in the first place?
Fuck.

3686
02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:51,940
How does one get there?
Let's say hypothetically,

3687
02:34:52,090 --> 02:34:54,030
how would one get there?
Get there.

3688
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:57,460
If you were writing a novel that was 
exactly how it all went down,

3689
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:01,240
how would you have the characters do it?
This is a novel.

3690
02:35:01,241 --> 02:35:02,890
This is all fiction,
so you're in.

3691
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:03,580
This is.
This.

3692
02:35:03,581 --> 02:35:08,581
Didn't actually happen,
but if it did happen in your book and 

3693
02:35:08,581 --> 02:35:08,950
your book,
How would the guy do it?

3694
02:35:09,040 --> 02:35:14,040
Well,
tell me a little nervous.

3695
02:35:15,311 --> 02:35:16,270
Listen,
don't be nervous.

3696
02:35:16,271 --> 02:35:17,800
There's nothing he can do.
This is all hypothetical.

3697
02:35:17,801 --> 02:35:19,180
We've already laid that out.
Well,

3698
02:35:19,181 --> 02:35:21,490
the Guy Moses that took me Undergrad,
he,

3699
02:35:21,910 --> 02:35:22,740
he,
you know,

3700
02:35:22,840 --> 02:35:24,820
he knows some things.
He's done some things.

3701
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:27,510
He might have been on the Eagle.
It was him.

3702
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:29,070
The same guy.
He might have been.

3703
02:35:29,250 --> 02:35:30,970
He might have been on your book and your
book,

3704
02:35:31,030 --> 02:35:32,020
his book.
You'll be.

3705
02:35:32,030 --> 02:35:34,420
You'll be writing this book that's 
coming out in March.

3706
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,380
Oh yeah,
there.

3707
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:41,430
That's the thing.
That's the slipper eagle that 

3708
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:41,430
motherfucker's stood on that.
Yeah.

3709
02:35:41,430 --> 02:35:43,110
Oh my God.
Just why?

3710
02:35:43,570 --> 02:35:48,070
Looking at my skin's crawling.
My assholes quivering.

3711
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:50,910
I haven't even talked to my hands are 
sweating crazy.

3712
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:52,990
I haven't even talked about this on my 
own show yet.

3713
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:55,270
What did you do?
What happened?

3714
02:35:55,271 --> 02:35:59,080
Tell me what the fuck he's going to be 
so fucking pissed off.

3715
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:00,280
Shit.
What I mean,

3716
02:36:00,281 --> 02:36:02,960
but you can word gets out there.
The Internet has no secrets.

3717
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Well,
why would he take me on this amazing 

3718
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,040
tour and it allow me to tow and allow me
to film it,

3719
02:36:09,470 --> 02:36:13,060
you know,
because maybe he's a crazy.

3720
02:36:13,510 --> 02:36:15,880
That's why he's fucking climbing around 
on metal eagles.

3721
02:36:15,880 --> 02:36:20,880
Sixty nine store.
What if he slipped and you look up his 

3722
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:20,880
bucket list?
Moses Gates.

3723
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:23,740
What if he slipped off and you had that?
I had my first anxiety attack,

3724
02:36:24,040 --> 02:36:25,690
panic attack.
Looking at that,

3725
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:27,070
uh,
when I went home that night,

3726
02:36:28,390 --> 02:36:30,340
over and over,
over and over again,

3727
02:36:30,341 --> 02:36:33,010
I,
I pictured him falling from that Eagle.

3728
02:36:33,070 --> 02:36:38,070
What would you have done?
Would you have gotten in trouble if he 

3729
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:38,070
didn't,
do you think,

3730
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:39,490
how am I going to explain that?
I think you would have been okay.

3731
02:36:39,670 --> 02:36:41,920
How?
How do you know I didn't push them?

3732
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:47,070
You have good lawyers.
Why would you push them and him sitting 

3733
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:47,070
on Jesus Christ.
Is that him?

3734
02:36:47,070 --> 02:36:47,670
So it's on the Internet,
right?

3735
02:36:47,671 --> 02:36:49,060
Okay.
So he's a crazy fuck.

3736
02:36:49,460 --> 02:36:52,970
Photos of him.
It's on his God damn twitter page op.

3737
02:36:53,210 --> 02:36:58,210
A photo of him on his fucking twitter 
page is him that's sitting on that 

3738
02:36:58,210 --> 02:36:58,210
Eagle.

3739
02:36:58,210 --> 02:36:59,680
So you don't have to worry.
That's Moses Gates.

3740
02:36:59,830 --> 02:37:01,730
He said cities,
hidden cities.

3741
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:03,100
Uh,
Fuck Moses.

3742
02:37:03,101 --> 02:37:04,660
The TV show,
I swear to God,

3743
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:06,880
what's wrong?
There's nothing wrong with that.

3744
02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:07,690
Well,
a book.

3745
02:37:08,080 --> 02:37:13,080
Well,
I did make a kind of a promise of the 

3746
02:37:13,080 --> 02:37:15,681
guy.
His book comes out and March Kim in his 

3747
02:37:15,681 --> 02:37:17,551
promises.
Dude's got a picture of him standing on 

3748
02:37:17,551 --> 02:37:17,551
top of thing on his twitter page 
basically like,

3749
02:37:17,551 --> 02:37:21,591
Hey,
don't tell anybody that I'm standing on 

3750
02:37:21,591 --> 02:37:24,621
top of this thing.
Meanwhile he's got a photo of it 

3751
02:37:24,621 --> 02:37:24,621
basically.
All right,

3752
02:37:24,621 --> 02:37:27,120
if you have a photo of it.
So we went off the hook,

3753
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:27,960
we went under ground,

3754
02:37:28,050 --> 02:37:31,140
the mole people used to live and then he
goes,

3755
02:37:31,141 --> 02:37:33,480
I want to show you something else.
So I go,

3756
02:37:33,500 --> 02:37:34,080
all right,
I'm up,

3757
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:39,260
but he won't tell me.
We take a cab ride and I kind of seen 

3758
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:39,540
the distance.
It's the Chrysler building.

3759
02:37:39,541 --> 02:37:44,541
I'm like,
I think he's fucking taking me to the 

3760
02:37:44,541 --> 02:37:44,541
Chrysler building.
Oh Shit.

3761
02:37:44,541 --> 02:37:46,650
And uh,
all of a sudden we got past security.

3762
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:52,340
His name was on a list and uh,
we went in the elevators and we went up 

3763
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:53,580
to,
I think the,

3764
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:55,320
I want to say like the,
well,

3765
02:37:55,321 --> 02:37:56,310
I don't know,
I don't want to say,

3766
02:37:56,640 --> 02:38:00,330
but in the fifties and then all of a 
sudden we get out of the elevator and do

3767
02:38:00,331 --> 02:38:01,600
a quick dark to the,
uh,

3768
02:38:01,660 --> 02:38:04,080
the stairwell and then we went up 
another,

3769
02:38:04,081 --> 02:38:09,081
I don't know,
like maybe seven or eight floors and 

3770
02:38:09,081 --> 02:38:10,650
next thing you know,
there might've been a door unlocked.

3771
02:38:10,651 --> 02:38:14,370
That isn't an office that is abandoned.

3772
02:38:16,590 --> 02:38:21,590
And from that you can get that office 
allegedly to the bowels or rather the 

3773
02:38:22,051 --> 02:38:23,820
peak the attic.
Oh Wow.

3774
02:38:23,821 --> 02:38:28,821
You're going there.
I thought I was doing the first part of 

3775
02:38:28,821 --> 02:38:31,230
the story.
God was this.

3776
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:33,510
So,
uh,

3777
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:38,540
this abandoned office leads to,
I think it used to be an observation 

3778
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:39,750
deck back in the day,
but the railings really low.

3779
02:38:39,751 --> 02:38:42,480
It's only about four feet.
I think.

3780
02:38:42,540 --> 02:38:44,600
Something like that.
People didn't give a fuck back then.

3781
02:38:44,630 --> 02:38:46,240
No.
And that's harder people and that.

3782
02:38:46,290 --> 02:38:48,000
And you're looking at it right now.
If you're watching,

3783
02:38:48,180 --> 02:38:49,800
you know,
watching this podcast,

3784
02:38:49,801 --> 02:38:53,550
that's the iconic eagles that had been 
in a shitload of movies and whatnot.

3785
02:38:53,640 --> 02:38:57,450
I'm telling you right now,
a lot my fucking hands are sweating.

3786
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:00,120
Looking at that picture,
my hands are sweating.

3787
02:39:00,121 --> 02:39:02,880
My toes were wiggling back and forth.
I'm shitting my pants.

3788
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:06,360
I'm just going to unload them my fucking
cyber right now.

3789
02:39:06,660 --> 02:39:11,660
So this guy knew that the,
the office space was abandoned and this 

3790
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:16,431
guy knew also that the door was unlocked
so he knew how to do it when he'd 

3791
02:39:16,950 --> 02:39:18,030
gotten.
He's obviously,

3792
02:39:18,031 --> 02:39:19,740
he's taking fucking pictures up there.
Well there's,

3793
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:22,500
there's a,
there's a whole network of people.

3794
02:39:22,501 --> 02:39:24,300
They go to each other cities and do this
shit.

3795
02:39:24,301 --> 02:39:26,940
So I'm on top of each other's rooms and 
whatever.

3796
02:39:26,941 --> 02:39:31,941
This is good.
This video is that guys on the ground 

3797
02:39:31,941 --> 02:39:33,891
and like old water tunnels and there's 
guys like climbing the fucking bridges 

3798
02:39:33,891 --> 02:39:35,960
and all that Shell of being up there 
lesbians.

3799
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:41,720
So we had to go up.
So then the door was the door to the 

3800
02:39:41,720 --> 02:39:45,171
outside was open sliding door and then 
it's like an old fucking observation 

3801
02:39:45,171 --> 02:39:47,310
deck with those eagles.
And then as I'm at,

3802
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:50,190
as I'm at one of the eagles just kind of
filming shit,

3803
02:39:50,790 --> 02:39:55,790
all of a sudden I look over and he's 
standing on the head of the Eagle.

3804
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:59,460
He doesn't even tell me.
So yeah,

3805
02:39:59,461 --> 02:40:01,470
there you go.
There's the picture of soaking wet.

3806
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:06,540
And then he did it again and that I do 
have a video of them doing it.

3807
02:40:06,541 --> 02:40:07,370
Fuck it.
I do have,

3808
02:40:10,650 --> 02:40:13,230
when he turns around and get back to 
safety,

3809
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:17,220
I saw the slight slip.
I saw how it would happen.

3810
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:22,340
Oh my God.
Where that's all it would take because 

3811
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:22,340
this thing is like Kinda.
It's first of all,

3812
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:22,660
it's not flat.
It's,

3813
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:27,680
it's it,
it's some kind of metal which looks 

3814
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:27,960
really slippery.
And there was a wind.

3815
02:40:28,380 --> 02:40:30,330
The wind was about 30 miles an hour that
day.

3816
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:33,420
And I saw him turn around and that just 
slight slip.

3817
02:40:33,421 --> 02:40:34,830
I'm like,
that's how it would have happened.

3818
02:40:35,190 --> 02:40:39,960
So when I went home that night and I saw
that play over and over again in my head

3819
02:40:39,961 --> 02:40:42,090
and I had my first fucking anxiety tech.

3820
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:47,840
I'm a middle aged man.
I've never had an anxiety attack before 

3821
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:51,050
my heart was pounding out of my chest.
I woke up my wife and she had a fucking 

3822
02:40:51,050 --> 02:40:53,430
calm me down because over and over again
I saw him fucking fallen.

3823
02:40:53,850 --> 02:40:58,850
If I was there,
I would have given you a hit of some of 

3824
02:40:58,850 --> 02:40:58,850
this shit and it will put you right over
the edge.

3825
02:40:58,850 --> 02:41:02,690
No Shit right there at that moment.
Then you give a hit of that green crack 

3826
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:02,690
and he'd be like,
what?

3827
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,510
And then we might have done other shit 
watching that.

3828
02:41:06,511 --> 02:41:08,430
Just watching.
That almost gives me a heart attack.

3829
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:12,660
So I got video of him going out and 
kissing the head and he's a crazy man.

3830
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:14,430
It's crazy.
Yeah man.

3831
02:41:14,431 --> 02:41:17,670
That's those things break off and then 
it kills people below to.

3832
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:19,590
What do you mean breaks off?
If it broke off,

3833
02:41:19,591 --> 02:41:21,900
what if,
what if his weight.

3834
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:24,870
It's just not designed to carry 180 
pound man or whatever the alleyways.

3835
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:26,850
Oh there he is on twitter.
So yeah,

3836
02:41:26,851 --> 02:41:28,380
he's crazy as fuck that.
All right.

3837
02:41:28,381 --> 02:41:30,880
So that part of the story.
I could tell that thrill.

3838
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,970
We know who we have coming in.
Folks.

3839
02:41:32,971 --> 02:41:36,690
We have Alex honnold.
Do you know who Alex honnold is?

3840
02:41:37,350 --> 02:41:38,940
Alex honnold is,
uh,

3841
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:42,780
he's coming in on the 28th.
He's that kid who free climbs.

3842
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:46,770
He Free Solo climbs like things that go 
backwards.

3843
02:41:46,771 --> 02:41:51,771
So like he's hanging off and climbing 
and pulling himself up like thousands of

3844
02:41:52,140 --> 02:41:54,660
feet.
He resold climbs places that nobody else

3845
02:41:54,661 --> 02:41:56,630
can do.
What about the guy I forgot his name and

3846
02:41:56,650 --> 02:42:01,650
Jim Norton's a big fan of is the guy 
that climbs outside of the buildings 

3847
02:42:01,650 --> 02:42:03,810
without any anything.
Who's at a French dude?

3848
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:06,150
Somebody helped us out.
He climbs buildings.

3849
02:42:06,180 --> 02:42:09,450
There's a million videos online.
It's Spiderman guy is.

3850
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:14,500
It's.
Does he call himself list spite on my 

3851
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:14,500
hands.
I am less spatter,

3852
02:42:14,500 --> 02:42:18,741
but there's a video where he was 
climbing a building and they made them 

3853
02:42:18,741 --> 02:42:18,750
wear a harness.
He didn't want to.

3854
02:42:18,850 --> 02:42:21,120
Yeah.
This video of him fucking slipping.

3855
02:42:21,121 --> 02:42:25,170
It would have been his death maybe,
but maybe because of the harness.

3856
02:42:25,230 --> 02:42:27,780
That's why he slipped.
Say you always got an answer.

3857
02:42:28,360 --> 02:42:31,290
Seems like you always have a safety net.
You'll fall.

3858
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:36,410
You're always thinking out of the box.
Cop didn't have a safety net and that's 

3859
02:42:36,410 --> 02:42:37,740
why you're successful in this radio 
business.

3860
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:42,210
If you had that safety net was logan 
bend,

3861
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:47,300
what does that.
This is the world's largest building in 

3862
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:50,751
China.
This is the guy climbing this fucking 

3863
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:50,751
thing.
Spiderman guy.

3864
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:50,751
He uses a suction cup.
Things.

3865
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:52,350
Oh my God,
but he's got a court.

3866
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:54,250
Is this the time when he had the safety 
net?

3867
02:42:54,690 --> 02:42:56,370
The safety line.
Oh my God.

3868
02:42:56,371 --> 02:43:01,371
Look at this guy you've never seen.
This guy knows pretty much every tall 

3869
02:43:01,371 --> 02:43:06,140
building in the world up just hanging 
off the side like it's no fuck outta me.

3870
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:08,790
Shit.
My pants shitting my pants.

3871
02:43:08,791 --> 02:43:10,470
Just watching them.
No Shit.

3872
02:43:10,580 --> 02:43:11,950
I that.
That is the

3873
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:13,990
fear of heights thing,
man.

3874
02:43:13,991 --> 02:43:16,660
Looking over the edge of a building.
There was many times while we're filming

3875
02:43:16,661 --> 02:43:18,760
fear factor,
we were at the top of buildings and that

3876
02:43:18,761 --> 02:43:23,761
would just freak myself out and just 
look over the edge of the Chrysler 

3877
02:43:23,861 --> 02:43:25,150
building.
That was pretty amazing.

3878
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:28,240
That's one of the tallest buildings in 
Manhattan,

3879
02:43:28,241 --> 02:43:29,090
right?
Yeah.

3880
02:43:29,480 --> 02:43:31,360
Without with the World Trade Center 
towers.

3881
02:43:31,720 --> 02:43:33,930
Is that number one state building number
one?

3882
02:43:33,931 --> 02:43:35,230
Empire State building?
Well,

3883
02:43:35,231 --> 02:43:37,750
no,
I said the new freedom tower,

3884
02:43:37,751 --> 02:43:42,751
wherever the fuck they call it is now 
officially taller and the Freedom Tower 

3885
02:43:42,751 --> 02:43:43,000
is not done yet,
right?

3886
02:43:43,090 --> 02:43:43,630
No,
no.

3887
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:44,980
It's almost,
they're really.

3888
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,200
When is it going to be done?
Maybe next year.

3889
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:53,070
That's got to be crazy to live in a city
and see something like that happen 

3890
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:53,290
because all of us that experienced 
September 11th,

3891
02:43:53,291 --> 02:43:55,690
we experience it from the west coast.
You know,

3892
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,520
it was creepy.
I,

3893
02:43:56,620 --> 02:43:57,650
I,
I,

3894
02:43:57,780 --> 02:44:02,780
I'll never forget the smell of a plastic
and death.

3895
02:44:05,300 --> 02:44:07,030
You could smell dramatic pause.
Yeah.

3896
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:08,890
Oh yeah.
Like I,

3897
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:10,750
I stayed,
I wasn't living in the city at the time,

3898
02:44:10,751 --> 02:44:15,751
but uh,
I stayed for a few days so we could 

3899
02:44:15,751 --> 02:44:15,751
broadcast because they shut down the 
whole fucking city.

3900
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:20,560
And in midtown you smelled burning 
plastic and you smelled death.

3901
02:44:20,590 --> 02:44:22,660
There was no doubt in your fucking mind 
that was,

3902
02:44:22,810 --> 02:44:26,040
that was dead people all the way in mid 
town.

3903
02:44:26,041 --> 02:44:28,510
I don't know how many miles officially 
that is from ground zero,

3904
02:44:28,511 --> 02:44:30,010
but you know,
it's quite a hike.

3905
02:44:30,610 --> 02:44:35,500
And I also remember that some people 
were just going about their day,

3906
02:44:35,501 --> 02:44:39,040
like nothing was different.
I remember like studying people,

3907
02:44:39,310 --> 02:44:44,310
I remember looking at these two women,
they were going to happy hour and they 

3908
02:44:44,310 --> 02:44:44,440
were just talking about their dme 
office,

3909
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:45,850
you know,
their day at the office.

3910
02:44:45,851 --> 02:44:47,560
And I'm sitting there thinking to 
myself,

3911
02:44:48,070 --> 02:44:53,070
Holy Fuck,
do you understand just what happened to 

3912
02:44:53,070 --> 02:44:53,070
the city 24 hours ago?

3913
02:44:53,070 --> 02:44:54,100
Oh God,
I never,

3914
02:44:54,160 --> 02:44:55,540
never forgot that.
Yeah,

3915
02:44:55,541 --> 02:45:00,541
it's weird how people can do that.
It's weird if some people can just kind 

3916
02:45:00,541 --> 02:45:02,260
of shut off and disconnect to that 
because most of the people living in New

3917
02:45:02,260 --> 02:45:02,890
York,
they were all like,

3918
02:45:02,891 --> 02:45:07,891
holy fuck.
But you did see these other people that 

3919
02:45:07,891 --> 02:45:10,840
they basically their,
their lives didn't change that day.

3920
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:14,500
I noticed that when I went to work that 
people were friendlier.

3921
02:45:15,710 --> 02:45:18,250
The people got a lot friendlier beyond 
friendly.

3922
02:45:18,251 --> 02:45:20,050
All of a sudden like you're looking 
people in the eyes.

3923
02:45:20,051 --> 02:45:22,420
Like when you live in New York City,
you don't look at anybody.

3924
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:24,640
Yeah,
it's a very lonely place.

3925
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:26,440
There's so many people,
but it's not weird.

3926
02:45:26,470 --> 02:45:29,230
It's a lonely place.
Like there's no one looks at anyone.

3927
02:45:29,620 --> 02:45:32,320
No one strikes depending conversations.
Very rare,

3928
02:45:32,650 --> 02:45:34,680
but after nine slash 11,
everyone was talking to each other.

3929
02:45:34,681 --> 02:45:37,720
It's really cool.
It's a weird thing about New York or you

3930
02:45:37,721 --> 02:45:42,721
go to a big place and it's crowded with 
people and no one's talking to anybody 

3931
02:45:42,721 --> 02:45:42,790
and everybody's being themselves.

3932
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:44,950
Unless they know they can get a buck 
off,

3933
02:45:44,951 --> 02:45:46,160
you know?
It's very strange.

3934
02:45:46,490 --> 02:45:48,430
They know they can make money off and 
then they're talking to you,

3935
02:45:48,431 --> 02:45:51,430
but in general you're not having that.
You know that small talk.

3936
02:45:51,431 --> 02:45:53,740
Like I live in a building.
I've been there for years.

3937
02:45:53,741 --> 02:45:56,500
I don't know anyone in my building.
No one talks to anyone.

3938
02:45:56,501 --> 02:46:01,501
I see the same people in the elevator 
and I want to look at him like we know 

3939
02:46:01,501 --> 02:46:05,221
each other.
How about we talk a little bit and I've 

3940
02:46:05,221 --> 02:46:05,221
tried,
but I think you're a creep.

3941
02:46:05,221 --> 02:46:06,280
No,
it happens to everybody.

3942
02:46:06,340 --> 02:46:07,750
It'd be easy to say that,
but no,

3943
02:46:07,810 --> 02:46:09,980
but then when you do have a with someone
in the

3944
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,900
elevator of my building,
you know they're visiting.

3945
02:46:12,210 --> 02:46:17,210
There's no doubt in your mind because 
they're the ones that are having that 

3946
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:19,670
small.
They don't think you're creep when 

3947
02:46:19,670 --> 02:46:19,670
you're trying to start up a 
conversation.

3948
02:46:19,670 --> 02:46:20,370
Oh,
I don't know because I feel like God,

3949
02:46:20,420 --> 02:46:25,420
we've seen it so many times.
I don't think I'm doing anything out of 

3950
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:25,420
the ordinary.
I never liked that about New York.

3951
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:27,260
I always thought that was really 
unfortunate that,

3952
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:31,790
that,
that sort of a behavior exists,

3953
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:36,840
right?
People like real standoffish with each 

3954
02:46:36,840 --> 02:46:38,681
other.
And one of the things that I liked the 

3955
02:46:38,681 --> 02:46:40,841
most about living a when I lived in 
Colorado was a few people there where 

3956
02:46:40,841 --> 02:46:41,900
there's only a 100,000
people in Boulder.

3957
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:43,500
People are very friendly,
you know,

3958
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:45,830
because it's just less,
less burnout.

3959
02:46:45,890 --> 02:46:47,140
It's like,
you know,

3960
02:46:47,240 --> 02:46:48,800
you're around people all the time.
You're like,

3961
02:46:48,801 --> 02:46:50,270
fuck,
we can get the fuck away from me,

3962
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:52,520
but then if you see somebody that you 
haven't seen it forever,

3963
02:46:52,521 --> 02:46:53,510
you're so happy to see them.

3964
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:55,850
It's like you to find.
You have to strike a balance point.

3965
02:46:56,040 --> 02:47:01,040
I don't think the balance point is 
stalking people up 70 funding stories 

3966
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:02,060
high and I kind of miss when I used to 
live in western New York,

3967
02:47:02,061 --> 02:47:06,210
it was more of a small town mentality.
Have you guys ever earlier,

3968
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:08,690
have you ever thought about moving 
somewhere else?

3969
02:47:08,720 --> 02:47:13,720
You and Anthony ever thought about not 
living in New York and just fucking 

3970
02:47:13,720 --> 02:47:13,820
taking the show on the road somewhere?
Oh hell no,

3971
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:14,730
no,
no.

3972
02:47:15,320 --> 02:47:20,320
I don't.
I don't even know how many more years 

3973
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:20,320
we're going to do it.
What are you gonna do?

3974
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:20,690
If you don't do that?
Just chill out for a awhile.

3975
02:47:20,870 --> 02:47:23,500
The Fuck Outta here.
What are you gonna die going to get old.

3976
02:47:23,510 --> 02:47:28,510
I'll fall apart.
Can hang out with him right back and 

3977
02:47:28,510 --> 02:47:28,510
just chill out.
Know you guys should do it for real.

3978
02:47:28,510 --> 02:47:28,820
You should do.

3979
02:47:28,820 --> 02:47:33,820
Exactly.
We're trying to figure out what's next 

3980
02:47:33,820 --> 02:47:34,370
for us to do exactly what you're doing,
but do it on the Internet because that's

3981
02:47:34,371 --> 02:47:36,050
what's going to be in everyone's fucking
stereo.

3982
02:47:36,350 --> 02:47:38,630
Everyone's car stereo is going to be 
connected to the Internet.

3983
02:47:38,690 --> 02:47:40,760
We probably should have made the leap 
this last contract,

3984
02:47:40,761 --> 02:47:43,610
but you can make the leap to years 
slowly,

3985
02:47:43,850 --> 02:47:46,100
you know,
you could just do it under assumed names

3986
02:47:46,101 --> 02:47:47,290
that everybody knows,
you know,

3987
02:47:47,300 --> 02:47:49,460
he could come up with your own name,
you know,

3988
02:47:49,660 --> 02:47:51,680
fucking Douchey,
you know,

3989
02:47:51,681 --> 02:47:52,600
whatever.
Call it.

3990
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:56,260
I think a Dale Dudley.
They call themselves teabagging taint.

3991
02:47:57,330 --> 02:47:59,900
I think he's got some sort of a,
a contract issue,

3992
02:47:59,930 --> 02:48:04,930
things like that.
Just do it and just start it up with 

3993
02:48:04,930 --> 02:48:05,510
what could they do.
I've done it for a long time.

3994
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:08,840
I know,
but it's easy and it's fun.

3995
02:48:08,841 --> 02:48:10,490
I'm just looking for something new and 
different.

3996
02:48:10,520 --> 02:48:11,210
Oh yeah.
Like what?

3997
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:12,740
I don't know.
That's the problem.

3998
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:13,790
Hmm.
I don't know.

3999
02:48:14,650 --> 02:48:15,940
I've been fooling around with this 
video.

4000
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:17,180
The west coast.
Come on out here,

4001
02:48:17,181 --> 02:48:18,740
man.
I've had a lot of fun because I'd have a

4002
02:48:18,741 --> 02:48:20,600
video on desk squad.
Bring you full circle.

4003
02:48:20,670 --> 02:48:23,090
It's podcasts.
Will fucking make some videos.

4004
02:48:23,610 --> 02:48:26,180
I can squat and be right next to Kevin 
Pereira.

4005
02:48:26,260 --> 02:48:28,250
Yeah.
So I hope Moses isn't pissed.

4006
02:48:28,251 --> 02:48:29,660
Abby.
Listen,

4007
02:48:29,661 --> 02:48:32,190
Moses is a crazy fuck and he's got other
things to worry about.

4008
02:48:32,220 --> 02:48:34,790
How about his need to climb on top of 
that Eagle?

4009
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:40,030
He's crazy.
Asshole and then we might have done 

4010
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:40,030
other shit.
I don't want to hear it.

4011
02:48:40,030 --> 02:48:42,500
And I'm getting nervous.
My hands literally or sweaty or wet.

4012
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:43,940
It was wet.
That was.

4013
02:48:45,120 --> 02:48:46,590
Yeah.
It'll come out.

4014
02:48:46,730 --> 02:48:49,010
It'll come out in March because I sort 
of promised the guy,

4015
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:52,250
well woopsies,
but if his,

4016
02:48:52,530 --> 02:48:54,680
if he's sitting on the Eagle on his 
twitter.

4017
02:48:54,681 --> 02:48:56,210
I guess where I right with that.
Yeah.

4018
02:48:56,211 --> 02:48:56,600
These,
uh,

4019
02:48:56,630 --> 02:48:58,670
Alex honnold guy that we've got coming 
in,

4020
02:48:58,671 --> 02:48:59,760
you know,
we were talking about him.

4021
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:00,980
I told Steve Rinella.
I go,

4022
02:49:00,981 --> 02:49:02,840
yeah,
I got Alex honnold is coming in.

4023
02:49:02,841 --> 02:49:04,790
He's going to do the podcast.
Goes better.

4024
02:49:04,791 --> 02:49:07,380
Get Him in as quick as you can.
Those guys ain't going last.

4025
02:49:08,800 --> 02:49:10,200
I don't even know who he is to be honest
with you.

4026
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:12,080
He's the climber Guy.
The Free Solo that.

4027
02:49:12,110 --> 02:49:12,830
Oh,
okay.

4028
02:49:12,970 --> 02:49:13,250
Right,
right,

4029
02:49:13,251 --> 02:49:18,251
right.
He better get him in because he's not 

4030
02:49:18,251 --> 02:49:18,251
going to last.
He's going to fall right eventually.

4031
02:49:18,251 --> 02:49:18,990
I don't know.
Maybe not.

4032
02:49:19,140 --> 02:49:22,620
He knows what he's doing.
Shit that takes fucking balls.

4033
02:49:24,060 --> 02:49:29,060
You ever see those guys like those,
those real mountain climbers where they 

4034
02:49:29,060 --> 02:49:30,840
have to be up there for the night and 
they set up their fucking.

4035
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:36,160
You can't even call it a tense and 
whatever the fuck the apparatuses that 

4036
02:49:36,160 --> 02:49:39,801
is just hanging off the side of it and 
they and they were able to get a good 

4037
02:49:39,801 --> 02:49:40,790
night's sleep.
How the fuck did you do that?

4038
02:49:40,820 --> 02:49:45,820
You know,
if you roll over and you're sleeping 

4039
02:49:45,820 --> 02:49:48,360
right up the edge and then you realize 
as you feel your back touch the ledge.

4040
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:52,400
All my God,
I'm going off in the tent.

4041
02:49:52,430 --> 02:49:53,040
No,
you're,

4042
02:49:53,070 --> 02:49:54,870
you're,
you're off the ledge.

4043
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:56,640
These,
these sleeping.

4044
02:49:56,641 --> 02:49:58,050
I don't know what they're officially 
called.

4045
02:49:58,051 --> 02:50:03,051
You're actually off the ledge sleeping.
Somehow they hammered into the side of 

4046
02:50:03,051 --> 02:50:04,020
the fucking.
Oh Jesus Christ,

4047
02:50:04,140 --> 02:50:09,140
cliff or whatever.
Can you can find a picture that is 

4048
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:09,140
insane.
What is it called?

4049
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:09,710
I don't know.
He'll,

4050
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:12,510
he'll find it,
but they set it up because you know,

4051
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,560
their climb.
Is that,

4052
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:17,040
that fucking long and they got to like 
camp out for awhile and there's no,

4053
02:50:17,230 --> 02:50:19,260
you know,
they're on the side of the fucking.

4054
02:50:19,620 --> 02:50:21,360
What do you think of those crazy fucks 
that kitten,

4055
02:50:21,361 --> 02:50:25,440
those wingsuits saying?
Did you see that one video?

4056
02:50:25,441 --> 02:50:27,160
It doesn't look jumps,
attend,

4057
02:50:27,270 --> 02:50:28,410
things like that.
Yeah.

4058
02:50:28,650 --> 02:50:30,690
Just hanging off the side and,
and,

4059
02:50:31,350 --> 02:50:32,970
and it's somewhere in your brain.
You're like,

4060
02:50:32,971 --> 02:50:33,900
yeah,
this is cool.

4061
02:50:33,901 --> 02:50:38,901
I'm going to,
I'm going to now sleep and then I'll 

4062
02:50:38,901 --> 02:50:38,901
continue my climb in the morning.

4063
02:50:38,901 --> 02:50:39,900
So insane.
Yeah.

4064
02:50:39,901 --> 02:50:41,970
What are the,
what are those?

4065
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:44,820
Oh my God.
Look at how that is set up.

4066
02:50:45,180 --> 02:50:48,720
That is the craziest fucking thing I've 
ever looked at in my life.

4067
02:50:48,870 --> 02:50:50,340
Really?
And you've seen some shit.

4068
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:55,370
Those things are crazy.
They're hanging those things off the 

4069
02:50:55,370 --> 02:50:55,950
edge and they're just sleeping in those 
little tent things.

4070
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:58,410
You gotta you gotTa.
Hope that what?

4071
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:00,420
However you fucking fast,
you know,

4072
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:02,670
put to the side of the.
Yeah,

4073
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:05,160
the rock face that it's going to be.
All right.

4074
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:07,950
Fucking Bananas Open.
That one up Brian.

4075
02:51:07,951 --> 02:51:11,970
That one looked like just having the one
to the left of that.

4076
02:51:12,450 --> 02:51:14,520
Oh my God.
It is hanging out.

4077
02:51:14,521 --> 02:51:19,030
Reading the is so fun.
Seeing this one before raising.

4078
02:51:19,630 --> 02:51:21,400
I'm Kinda happy that I was able to turn 
you onto.

4079
02:51:21,430 --> 02:51:23,820
Oh my gosh,
these people are not.

4080
02:51:23,821 --> 02:51:26,720
You're always turned me onto some shit.
I finally got got one for you.

4081
02:51:28,980 --> 02:51:30,510
Could you do that?
Oh,

4082
02:51:30,620 --> 02:51:31,980
I mean,
I guess I could,

4083
02:51:31,981 --> 02:51:35,040
but I wouldn't like it at all.
All my instincts.

4084
02:51:35,330 --> 02:51:36,750
The last.
I don't know.

4085
02:51:36,751 --> 02:51:41,751
I mean,
you're essentially like shutting off 

4086
02:51:41,751 --> 02:51:41,751
that part of your brain that tells you 
you're,

4087
02:51:41,751 --> 02:51:42,330
you're shitting your pants.
Fuck.

4088
02:51:42,331 --> 02:51:47,331
You know,
it tells you you could die with one 

4089
02:51:47,331 --> 02:51:47,331
little slip.
Those guys die all the time.

4090
02:51:47,370 --> 02:51:49,170
Those climber guys,
that's a.

4091
02:51:49,171 --> 02:51:51,060
that's a crazy life.
Of course you might.

4092
02:51:51,090 --> 02:51:52,660
You might make it,
you might be fine.

4093
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:55,560
So what's up with the wing suits?
It does.

4094
02:51:55,561 --> 02:52:00,561
Cause rather than mom,
did you see the one video where the guy 

4095
02:52:00,561 --> 02:52:02,721
thinks holding up the balloons or 
something and the wing suit guy comes 

4096
02:52:02,721 --> 02:52:03,570
flying through and I think it's on Vimeo
or something.

4097
02:52:03,660 --> 02:52:06,040
He's holding up a balloon tweeted the 
other day.

4098
02:52:06,041 --> 02:52:11,041
It was just amazing.
He jumped off the top of a fucking 

4099
02:52:11,041 --> 02:52:12,340
mountain and now he's flying through the
valley and,

4100
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:13,810
and he's coming towards buddy.

4101
02:52:13,810 --> 02:52:18,810
And the buddy I think holds up balloons 
or something literally right over his 

4102
02:52:18,810 --> 02:52:20,920
head and he comes flying at.
You could barely see.

4103
02:52:20,921 --> 02:52:22,840
It's just like a flash.
Yeah,

4104
02:52:22,841 --> 02:52:25,210
they're going really fast.
They go like 100 miles an hour.

4105
02:52:25,810 --> 02:52:27,820
That is fucked up.
They're so silly.

4106
02:52:28,750 --> 02:52:31,420
Look at these motherfuckers climbing 
this wall.

4107
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:35,490
These people are so crazy.
You're,

4108
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:38,170
you're a fingertip strength.
It's got to be ridiculous.

4109
02:52:38,200 --> 02:52:43,200
Oh yeah.
These guys can do mad chin ups to their 

4110
02:52:43,200 --> 02:52:44,170
hand strength and their,
their ability to do chin ups.

4111
02:52:44,171 --> 02:52:45,880
It's fucking nuts.
What am I doing?

4112
02:52:45,881 --> 02:52:48,520
Like one finger chin-ups.
Mars works on our show.

4113
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,650
I didn't see it.
I heard him talking about.

4114
02:52:50,651 --> 02:52:53,050
But I had to do something before we 
start our radio show.

4115
02:52:53,051 --> 02:52:55,750
Last week there was a video he was 
going,

4116
02:52:55,751 --> 02:52:58,900
this fucking guy's doing a chin ups with
one finger,

4117
02:52:59,040 --> 02:53:00,160
you know?
Have you seen it?

4118
02:53:00,190 --> 02:53:01,120
No,
but I believe it.

4119
02:53:01,390 --> 02:53:02,730
You believe it?
Yeah.

4120
02:53:03,290 --> 02:53:04,450
Yeah.
People can fucking.

4121
02:53:04,451 --> 02:53:06,460
Finger just takes time.
You know,

4122
02:53:06,461 --> 02:53:09,340
you start out with your full hand.
Then you work your way to four fingers,

4123
02:53:09,341 --> 02:53:11,320
three fingers to.
And the more you keep doing it,

4124
02:53:11,321 --> 02:53:12,400
you can do it.
Wow.

4125
02:53:12,500 --> 02:53:15,340
The guys can do chin ups,
pushups rather with one finger.

4126
02:53:15,460 --> 02:53:18,760
I've seen that one finger on each side.
Guys do pushups,

4127
02:53:19,240 --> 02:53:20,500
full pushups.
Amazing.

4128
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:22,460
Supporting themselves with one finger,
right?

4129
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:27,470
Yeah.
You can develop a crazy strengthen your 

4130
02:53:27,470 --> 02:53:27,470
hands and your tendons.
It's like the difference between someone

4131
02:53:27,470 --> 02:53:32,071
who's really strong and someone who's 
not really strong is at the summit is 

4132
02:53:32,071 --> 02:53:32,110
really strong.
Oh look at this guy fall.

4133
02:53:34,670 --> 02:53:36,440
Looking at him.
He's being a dick head.

4134
02:53:36,450 --> 02:53:38,700
He's having fun.
The difference.

4135
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:43,060
Having fun because he slipped and caught
himself and was okay with the difference

4136
02:53:43,061 --> 02:53:48,061
between someone really strong and 
someone's not really strong besides 

4137
02:53:48,061 --> 02:53:48,061
genetics,
is that someone is really strong,

4138
02:53:48,070 --> 02:53:53,070
forced their body to get strong by 
making it lift weights a lot and keep 

4139
02:53:53,070 --> 02:53:53,800
going and keep going.
Fuck you.

4140
02:53:53,801 --> 02:53:55,480
Lift away.
It's fuck you lift the weights.

4141
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:58,120
So this Alex honnold guy and he's 
climber guys,

4142
02:53:58,270 --> 02:54:01,420
they're constantly climbing and oh my 
God,

4143
02:54:01,810 --> 02:54:06,810
this guy just felt look at this.
Oh Shit has got all in my God ain't 

4144
02:54:06,810 --> 02:54:09,700
knows how to grab them.
You get a slam it to the side now,

4145
02:54:09,730 --> 02:54:14,730
but the impact that the impact,
I never had a discipline that line on 

4146
02:54:14,801 --> 02:54:19,801
that thing that's supporting him.
That's so crazy because at that breaks 

4147
02:54:19,801 --> 02:54:19,801
off,
man,

4148
02:54:19,801 --> 02:54:24,750
you're fucked and he's just silly around
their hands get super strong because 

4149
02:54:25,571 --> 02:54:26,620
they just force them to.

4150
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:28,900
They're constantly carrying shit with 
their hands.

4151
02:54:29,160 --> 02:54:33,700
Their hands just get sick as fuck.
The kid is coming in.

4152
02:54:33,701 --> 02:54:36,340
He has his family there.
His fingers like sausage fingers,

4153
02:54:36,370 --> 02:54:38,410
so twice the size of a normal finger.
Really?

4154
02:54:38,490 --> 02:54:38,890
Yeah.
They just,

4155
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:41,230
they just get huge from carrying his 
weight.

4156
02:54:41,350 --> 02:54:43,720
He's not a big guys like they want to be
very slight,

4157
02:54:43,870 --> 02:54:47,380
big hands and be a slight person.
Carry yourself around that,

4158
02:54:47,980 --> 02:54:50,920
but you know,
it's a weird way to get you thrills,

4159
02:54:51,130 --> 02:54:51,970
you know?
Sure.

4160
02:54:52,150 --> 02:54:57,150
It's a weird way to just get your 
jollies out of climbing the top of 

4161
02:54:57,150 --> 02:54:58,750
something that can fucking kill you at 
sleeping on the side.

4162
02:55:01,810 --> 02:55:04,070
Don't go to the top of the Chrysler.
We got to wrap this

4163
02:55:04,070 --> 02:55:04,910
bitch up.
Joe.

4164
02:55:04,911 --> 02:55:05,690
This was fun,
man.

4165
02:55:05,691 --> 02:55:09,440
You got me out of my comfort zone.
I'm so happy you came down to this.

4166
02:55:09,441 --> 02:55:12,410
I would.
This podcast owes you a lot man,

4167
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:15,380
not just for naming death squad,
which is a ridiculous name,

4168
02:55:15,381 --> 02:55:17,420
but you know,
that deserves a twitter plug,

4169
02:55:17,650 --> 02:55:19,640
but anyone but not,
not just data,

4170
02:55:19,670 --> 02:55:24,670
but that's for Stan,
for creating a radio show that allowed 

4171
02:55:25,311 --> 02:55:30,311
us to realize that there's a show in 
[inaudible] talking because there's a 

4172
02:55:30,311 --> 02:55:31,340
show and just hanging and that,
you know,

4173
02:55:31,341 --> 02:55:35,270
you guys make it so comfortable for us,
for comics to come in and fuck around.

4174
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:40,330
And uh,
I think a lot of podcasts really 

4175
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:40,330
followed that lead.
I kind of,

4176
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:42,470
I don't want to play that game usually,
but I kind of get that feeling.

4177
02:55:42,970 --> 02:55:46,400
A lot of the podcasts are very,
very much like one.

4178
02:55:46,430 --> 02:55:51,430
I feel like it,
you guys are the most unstructured of 

4179
02:55:51,430 --> 02:55:54,821
all the major radio show told you that's
because we're lazy and it just worked 

4180
02:55:54,821 --> 02:55:54,821
out because it works.

4181
02:55:54,821 --> 02:55:56,630
That's the right way to do it.
You're lucky to the lazy way's the right

4182
02:55:56,631 --> 02:55:57,370
way to do it.
We actually,

4183
02:55:58,190 --> 02:56:00,210
we used to like prepare for our show and
we,

4184
02:56:00,340 --> 02:56:01,330
we,
that was like,

4185
02:56:01,760 --> 02:56:06,140
that was some of our worst shows that 
because we did try to have structure for

4186
02:56:06,141 --> 02:56:11,141
awhile there and there's some days where
like we don't even know what the fuck 

4187
02:56:11,141 --> 02:56:11,220
we're doing,
but by the end of the show we,

4188
02:56:11,460 --> 02:56:12,890
you know,
we had a good one.

4189
02:56:13,040 --> 02:56:16,460
You guys have an awesome group between 
Norton who's in my opinion,

4190
02:56:16,461 --> 02:56:19,070
the funniest fucking guy was ever been 
on radio ever.

4191
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:24,280
He makes me how all that kind of regular
basis listen to that show just because 

4192
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:28,391
he's so perverted and twisted in these,
carved out his own little fucking slice 

4193
02:56:28,391 --> 02:56:29,120
of the world with that,
you know,

4194
02:56:29,121 --> 02:56:30,950
his way and you know his way of 
thinking,

4195
02:56:30,951 --> 02:56:35,951
so it's extra hilarious when he says 
something crops up and then Anthony's 

4196
02:56:35,951 --> 02:56:39,401
fucking bananas and you're crazy and the
three guys together know each other so 

4197
02:56:39,401 --> 02:56:39,401
well and then you bring in comics.

4198
02:56:39,650 --> 02:56:40,990
It's just awesome.
It's been a good run,

4199
02:56:40,991 --> 02:56:45,991
man.
It has and it is for real is the reason 

4200
02:56:45,991 --> 02:56:48,731
why we do this podcast today.
I guarantee you it has a lot to do with 

4201
02:56:48,731 --> 02:56:49,160
it in a weird that someone will 
acknowledge us.

4202
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:51,090
Weird.
Yeah.

4203
02:56:51,110 --> 02:56:55,070
Not many people to really know what that
to feel left out.

4204
02:56:55,071 --> 02:56:55,740
Poor.
Oh No,

4205
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:58,100
no.
Honestly it means a lot.

4206
02:56:58,101 --> 02:56:58,900
Thank you.
Listen,

4207
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:00,650
I don't know how to handle that because 
we don't.

4208
02:57:00,710 --> 02:57:02,330
We usually don't hear that.
Well,

4209
02:57:02,331 --> 02:57:03,200
listen,
you guys,

4210
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:05,630
you,
you created the most fun environment and

4211
02:57:05,631 --> 02:57:07,860
radio for comics to come and hang out 
and you brother.

4212
02:57:07,910 --> 02:57:11,510
And because of that you've had so many 
funny fucking shows.

4213
02:57:11,540 --> 02:57:13,850
I mean,
it's just a brilliant,

4214
02:57:13,851 --> 02:57:15,060
brilliant run.
You know,

4215
02:57:15,380 --> 02:57:17,540
it's not like it's over anything.
I'm saying it like it's over.

4216
02:57:17,570 --> 02:57:20,780
Like you're retiring and shit.
I'll be on the radio tomorrow.

4217
02:57:21,380 --> 02:57:24,050
I stayed in La just for you.
Have you done live in the compound?

4218
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:27,320
Have you done in the compound?
He's another reason.

4219
02:57:27,321 --> 02:57:32,321
Anthony is another reason why we do it.
That's why we started doing it on 

4220
02:57:32,321 --> 02:57:32,321
ustream.
Yeah.

4221
02:57:32,321 --> 02:57:32,321
He,
uh,

4222
02:57:32,321 --> 02:57:33,140
he's not naughty motherfucker you work 
with.

4223
02:57:33,670 --> 02:57:35,000
I love him.
I love that guy.

4224
02:57:35,300 --> 02:57:36,410
Yeah.
Well I'm going to be there.

4225
02:57:36,411 --> 02:57:41,411
Uh,
I think in April or something like that 

4226
02:57:41,411 --> 02:57:41,411
or March.
So whenever there's a huge,

4227
02:57:41,411 --> 02:57:43,610
there's a UFC coming up there soon.
I'm taking her on the radio tomorrow.

4228
02:57:43,790 --> 02:57:47,270
I'm going to be there a day early just 
to hang with you guys.

4229
02:57:47,360 --> 02:57:48,590
Or Joe.
I remember my brother.

4230
