00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,311
Hi everybody,

2
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm here with Nick Nixon.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,340
Just did the podcast for the first time.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,210
It was incredible.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,110
It was amazing.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,720
Now the drive back is
going to be not that bad.

7
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,500
It won't be bad now.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,800
No,

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,311
it's perfect.

10
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,760
There's no traffic right now going well,

11
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,431
it might be a little.

12
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:18,360
It's actually 6:00.

13
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:18,860
Yeah,

14
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,860
it's actually rush hour,

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,450
but usually people are going
the opposite direction and I go,

16
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,160
well actually they're kind of
going everywhere right now,

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,310
tonight before holidays.

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,380
So people done son,

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,260
Echo Park.

20
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,070
Oh,

21
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,510
I can give you better directions.

22
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,050
Yeah,

23
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,530
there is a way to avoid a lot of shit.

24
00:00:38,531 --> 00:00:39,810
That's what I thought it was going to get.

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,380
A sneaky little way that
you can avoid to leave here.

26
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,150
I'm going to move even
further away from here.

27
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,300
I've looked at and I liked it.

28
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,250
I looked at some places.

29
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,760
I want to move them.

30
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,070
I want to get a house in the mountains.

31
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:53,940
I would love to.

32
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,500
I want to get a house in Lake Arrowhead,

33
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,580
hour out or whatever.

34
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,620
That's what I'm talking about.

35
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,670
It's amazing up there.

36
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,713
So Sam,

37
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,990
we can relax and bring benches and
there's weird she bought them to deliver

38
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,283
around that.

39
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,330
There's a lot of interesting cats up
there and so anywhere you live in the

40
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:13,830
mountains,

41
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,491
you live in the mountains,

42
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,200
living with people that
are living around nature.

43
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,680
You got to live around interesting
people and for sure they got strong,

44
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,193
strong,

45
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,270
strong mountains.

46
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,970
We have that here though too.

47
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,650
We definitely have a
lack of strong strongly.

48
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,561
In fact,

49
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,850
sometimes the wait is too strong,

50
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,241
you know,

51
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,290
I forgot what we were.

52
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,030
Um.

53
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,850
Oh Canada,

54
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,070
no,

55
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,570
England,

56
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:36,961
England.

57
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,550
We had some weed in
England and I was like,

58
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:39,540
this is really good weed.

59
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,650
It's not too strong.

60
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,770
It's like I don't feel
like I want roller kit.

61
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,490
Like Roller Skates Hash.

62
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,310
No,

63
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,330
it was weed,

64
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,060
but it was like,

65
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,160
it wasn't like,

66
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,430
you know,

67
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,000
some California where it is so hard.

68
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,021
It's so stony.

69
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,240
It's so powerful that
you kind of just like,

70
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,350
you get hit with any like,

71
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:55,801
Whoa,

72
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,030
I gotta manage this.

73
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,710
You know your mind in terms of job.

74
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,031
Yeah.

75
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,864
It's like,

76
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,060
but whereas with this weed it was silly.

77
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,740
We'd was like,

78
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,441
you hit it,

79
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,111
you felt high,

80
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:05,761
you felt good,

81
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:10,170
but you didn't feel too fucked up and
it took like four hits not to like two

82
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,004
minutes of California.

83
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,160
Are you adjusting to a
different atmosphere?

84
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,240
Yeah.

85
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah.

86
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,570
And you want to talk about.

87
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,040
I think Seattle's depressing.

88
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:21,991
Yeah.

89
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,411
I've never.

90
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,820
I've only spent a night in England,

91
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,654
a mentor.

92
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,543
Did you do stand up there?

93
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,173
People are great.

94
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,691
The grant,

95
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,740
we did a UFC there too.

96
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,830
The people are really nice people.

97
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,060
Some of the most polite people.

98
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,420
I really smart as well,

99
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:34,141
but man,

100
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,360
the weather is oppressing
whether it seems like that fall,

101
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,630
foggy and raining every day and

102
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,911
that too.

103
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,744
Yeah,

104
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,261
they don't have that.

105
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:44,850
American dental son.

106
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
Wga,

107
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,250
their dental bills.

108
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,180
Nick,

109
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,110
you're a road warrior.

110
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,940
How many days a year do you travel?

111
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,840
A.

112
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,160
I'd probably only on the road,

113
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,210
like maybe half the year.

114
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,450
Maybe.

115
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:54,960
Really important.

116
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,530
Yeah,

117
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,770
because I go off and on because I write
in town to get writing and you stay in

118
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:02,480
town and then he just started
doing stand up on the felon.

119
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:02,771
Yeah,

120
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,604
fill in time.

121
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,660
Shizam bitches.

122
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,321
They heard it.

123
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:09,310
That's how he runs his life and
you could find nick on twitter.

124
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,890
It's nic k a t h e.

125
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,350
that's exactly how.

126
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,100
Find funding and I'm verified.

127
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:15,501
So you,

128
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:15,961
that's how you know.

129
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:16,900
It's really mean.

130
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,940
I would imagine we're
making video powerful.

131
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,980
Hold on us or was a today Donald Trump,

132
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,680
another hilarious podcast.

133
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,514
Man,

134
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,431
we haven't done that.

135
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:33,670
Otherwise we're dead.

136
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,320
We need to do it like once a month.

137
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,400
I'd love to keep to keep
figuring out a way to avoid this.

138
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,420
This is what we have to do.

139
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,420
We have to do a steady one of these
because I think one a month is perfect for

140
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,430
us to have a shitload of things that
we haven't talked to each other,

141
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,420
you know,

142
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,370
because we talked so much about the,

143
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,650
on the phone about things and we see
each other clubs about things that

144
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,430
sometimes a lot of stuff gets like tread
to the point where we can't bring it up

145
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:00,060
organically in front of each other anymore
because we already talked about that.

146
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,250
So when you're talking about on the
podcast doesn't come out as seamlessly.

147
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,010
So we have like one
month between podcasts.

148
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,540
We built up a lot of good shit.

149
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:07,771
Yeah,

150
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:08,290
we do.

151
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,123
It's good.

152
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,100
It's been a month since
the last one about right.

153
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,260
I've been fucking around with this bit.

154
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:14,401
Well,

155
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:15,200
I can't tell.

156
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,690
I can't tell you.

157
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,524
It's not ready yet.

158
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,790
I'll tell you after we're done with this.

159
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,983
You can't know yet.

160
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,923
Someday be.

161
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,150
It's going to be a good bit.

162
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,290
It's doing really well right now,

163
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,124
but needs some work.

164
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,360
I just want to talk to my friend.

165
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:26,950
I'm going to go to Chicago or you guys.

166
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,390
Interesting.

167
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,223
I

168
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,360
go to the Chicago theater and
it will be lots of foreign firm.

169
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,830
We are bringing a party.

170
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,980
We're bringing Joey Diaz and Dunkin
and you know what it is what it is.

171
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,660
It is a big fat fucking comedy party.

172
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,500
That's what it's going to be.

173
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,460
It's going to be a good time.

174
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,830
The Chicago theater is awesome.

175
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,520
Um,

176
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,980
we're having the UFC Wayne's
there that same night,

177
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,920
so the way it's going to be there at
4:00 and we're going to have a show there

178
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,121
at eight.

179
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:54,571
It's called.

180
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:54,830
Yeah,

181
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,480
it's awesome.

182
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,360
And it's fun because when I was
looking for theaters in Chicago,

183
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,050
um,

184
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,590
we uh,

185
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,710
tried to get this theater and they said
that someone has a hold on it for that

186
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,711
day.

187
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:02,951
I'm like,

188
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:03,341
well fuck,

189
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:03,700
let's fine,

190
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,610
let's challenge the whole.

191
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,400
It's finding a whole lose the UFC fairly.

192
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,480
So I knew the UFC was going
to be out of there by 6:00.

193
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,220
They're done.

194
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,500
And then we come in at
eight to house bitch.

195
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,360
And I haven't been to
Chicago in a long time.

196
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,991
The last time was,

197
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:18,340
there was actually my 40th birthday.

198
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,233
I've never been.

199
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,470
Remember we had that crazy birthday cake.

200
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:22,980
Right.

201
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,400
Great comedy came from Chicago.

202
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,630
Chicago's a great comedy town.

203
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,440
You know what?

204
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,650
It's a comedy town that much like
Boston was at one point in time,

205
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,431
a great comments on.

206
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,720
And that was a little bit deprived.

207
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:31,971
You know,

208
00:05:31,971 --> 00:05:32,200
there's,

209
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,460
there's not that much there anymore.

210
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:36,520
There's a few clubs that have died off
or something made comics coming out of

211
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
Chicago.

212
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,601
You know,

213
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,560
when kids start out there,

214
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,830
they try to get out of there
and go somewhere with a scene.

215
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,190
No,

216
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,930
there's a few scenes left in the country.

217
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,680
Denver is,

218
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,401
in my opinion,

219
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,270
one of the big ones.

220
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,260
Underrated,

221
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,831
underrated,

222
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:48,581
under appreciated.

223
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,150
Seeing.

224
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,340
Oh,

225
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,661
Denver.

226
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,494
It's fucking great.

227
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,870
You know what else has got
a good scene in Atlanta?

228
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,860
That's great.

229
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,290
Can,

230
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,123
it's going to seem.

231
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,720
And the fucking the um.

232
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,111
Oh,

233
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:01,651
the other place.

234
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,040
So the Jesus Christ,

235
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,220
the place that I was going to.

236
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:05,520
What?

237
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,230
Sarah Club?

238
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,711
I don't know.

239
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,250
Only to the punchline.

240
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,160
Punchlines cars.

241
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,993
How can I remember that?

242
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,770
No.

243
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,551
So many names.

244
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:12,210
The chuckle hut,

245
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,170
the fuck factory,

246
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:14,580
the fucking giggle house.

247
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,770
But the punchline is amazing club.

248
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,920
That place is super old school
and it's really a museum.

249
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,620
It's just like the ice house when you
walk around and see shit on the wall.

250
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,970
That's called Holy Shit.

251
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:24,390
This is like,

252
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,620
you know,

253
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,310
as a headshot from 1980.

254
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,320
This is the punchline,

255
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,690
the laughing skull man because it's this
compact like fucking Bentley Room style

256
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,850
underground club.

257
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:39,851
And like it's a great thing to see I
think like 100 and that sounds like the

258
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:40,990
perfect place to go to,

259
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,200
to work on new material.

260
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,951
I can love it man.

261
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,710
It's beautiful club events
right under this cool bar,

262
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,431
the vortex.

263
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,264
So it's like,

264
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,800
I mean when I go there and man,

265
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:51,380
it's really bad because
it's endless beer and like,

266
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:51,621
dude,

267
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,450
let's go together.

268
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,200
I'd love to.

269
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,390
Oh,

270
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,290
that'd be so fun.

271
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,480
I'm going to do that right after I filmed
my next special because when I fell my

272
00:06:59,481 --> 00:06:59,931
next special,

273
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,690
the first thing I'm going to do
is go on a rampage of small club.

274
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,570
So after that I don't know.

275
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,160
I'm going there and I'm booked
again for like the summer,

276
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,400
but we should fucking be
so fun to hang out there

277
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,920
window from the time I record specialist
at the time I'd actually air still like

278
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,750
you have to come up with a lot of new
fucking material so I'm going to want to

279
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,670
go on the road a lot right after it airs.

280
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,250
I'm going on a long before,

281
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,460
you know,

282
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,230
because I only have like three or four
months to really come up with them on a

283
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,064
new shit.

284
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,481
It's,

285
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:28,314
it's tricky,

286
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:28,630
you know,

287
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,720
but those small places like the place
we're going to be out this weekend,

288
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,220
the Pasadena Ice House,

289
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,090
we're in the annex,

290
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:36,190
which is a really awesome room.

291
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,320
It is a really rare opportunity to see
comedy in like about as intimate and

292
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:42,360
environment that you're ever gonna.

293
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,420
See Doug Benson,

294
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,590
Joey Diaz,

295
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,633
me,

296
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,900
Pablo Francisco.

297
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:47,061
It's,

298
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:47,350
it's,

299
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,520
it's about as intimate as you get and we
do them there all the time and you can

300
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:56,140
get that podcast that we do from there
as well on desk squad on itunes and it's

301
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,340
called the ice house chronicle.

302
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,350
So what we do is while
the show is going on,

303
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:00,790
a podcast is also going on,

304
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,900
so one guy's on stage and five guys and
girls or whatever are in this room and

305
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,270
they're all talking
shit and it's hilarious.

306
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,530
It's comics hanging out.

307
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,880
It's a real green room.

308
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,010
It's a green room where it's like,

309
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:15,970
the way it's set up is you know
about as ideal as you can get.

310
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,820
Super Cool weed friendly comedy club.

311
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,390
You know the,

312
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,990
the bar is called the bartenders.

313
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,853
Cool.

314
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,360
Exactly.

315
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,260
The ruins an awesome five small

316
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,560
and it always sells out and
it's packed with podcast fans.

317
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,740
So if you want to check that,

318
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,950
do you want to check that out too?

319
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:33,784
So.

320
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,210
Alright,

321
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:34,600
that's it.

322
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,220
Dante.

323
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:35,650
Right.

324
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,560
So it's good to see you buddy.

325
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,443
Do you need.

326
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,870
Do you need anything man?

327
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,170
I'm.

328
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,830
Oh I have two flashlights on.

329
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,330
Cool.

330
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,560
Alright.

331
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,393
Give me some knuckles.

332
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,710
Stable was feeding

333
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,880
this table is better now
because it's got a new cloth.

334
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,180
So balls have fallen
easier until it breaks in.

335
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,450
Done another really fun podcast.

336
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:01,110
Brian,

337
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,010
did you enjoy it?

338
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,903
Yes.

339
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,080
Prophet Ron Paul Shark.

340
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,600
I have about 100 of them because
when I said that I wanted to uh,

341
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,680
where Ron Paul shirt on the tonight show.

342
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,641
Everybody got me.

343
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:15,870
Ron Paul shirts including
Alex Jones sent two boxes.

344
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,570
Two boxes or Ron Paul shirts.

345
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,180
So you can have some Ron
Paul shirts to Brian Sweet.

346
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,960
Like some Alex Jones.

347
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,361
Okay.

348
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,110
I got one.

349
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,810
We're hanging out with my friend Aubrey
who used to be Chris and it's the only

350
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:31,230
friend that I tolerate a change
their name and what else?

351
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,470
I'm like get the fuck Outta here.

352
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,480
I can't change your name.

353
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:33,991
I bought.

354
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:36,720
I've been persistent and you
can change your name as long.

355
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,640
Isn't it?

356
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,190
Incorporate.

357
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,970
It's become.

358
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,830
If it's psychedelically inspired,

359
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,900
I allow a certain amount of leniency.

360
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,460
It was already my middle name.

361
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,230
It's not like you made up a name.

362
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,700
I am sunflower,

363
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,321
right?

364
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,154
I'm apple.

365
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,240
Your thermal change your name?

366
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,470
I did red band.

367
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,401
That's right.

368
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:54,234
You did.

369
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,143
Good point.

370
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,350
I want to show everybody that fucking
super sexy fanny pack your rock and that.

371
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,570
His debts,

372
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,040
that Syrup Syrup Fanny packs
that sort of makes a hemp gear.

373
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,420
They make a hemp geek that I wear as
well and they've decided to make a

374
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,510
fanny pack when it's so big.

375
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:19,380
It's like a backpack that I use
it for a camera bag in one way.

376
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,880
It's pretty fucking killer though.

377
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm going to use it for traveling
I think because it's tough,

378
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,840
but hemp is amazing material man.

379
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,750
I mean I really should have
made my tee shirts at a half,

380
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:33,510
but it would have been even more
expensive than the ones that I have now.

381
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,590
I like the highest.

382
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,850
The higher primates shirts,

383
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,320
highest quality cotton.

384
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:39,650
I could get and really thin light ponds,

385
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:40,800
so it's like real comfortable,

386
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,873
but people were like,

387
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,603
Make Hampshire.

388
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,240
It's probably isn't move because
happens a superior form of cloth.

389
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,440
It's just much stronger.

390
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,980
I like him.

391
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,400
Shirts,

392
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,233
tee shirts.

393
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,880
My Ge mad shrunk like crazy.

394
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,400
That whole shit bamboos.

395
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:56,240
And another good one too.

396
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,810
It's easy to grow again.

397
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,000
You can get really good bamboo sheets.

398
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,310
Bedsheets using those for a long time.

399
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:02,551
Also,

400
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,210
towels,

401
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,270
rugs naturally antimicrobial as well.

402
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:08,650
So maybe have bamboo grows fast.

403
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,493
It's fun.

404
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,011
Show about,

405
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:11,340
um,

406
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,990
them taking bamboo and using it to make
houses because you chop it up and you

407
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:16,081
know,

408
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:20,730
use the fibers of and they make a
cardboard or plywood and have this bamboo

409
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:21,450
fiber.

410
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,460
But it grows like nothing.

411
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,310
It's all of you watching.

412
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,760
Yeah.

413
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,380
What a fucking plan.

414
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,750
And they use it for um,

415
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,210
uh,

416
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,250
occasionally use it for pool cues as well.

417
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,330
Some guys have been doing that recently
because the strength of bamboo compare

418
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:37,490
to the strength of other woods,

419
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,090
like through the roof
on that kind of line,

420
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,160
that vertical line apparently in
the this splice it and compile it.

421
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,600
And when you make a pool cue here,

422
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,790
but it has like a fucking,

423
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,170
like a crazy hit to.

424
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,020
It felt like extra spring to.

425
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:53,190
It just totally makes sense.

426
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,210
We're about to do some
manly shit right now.

427
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:55,930
Play Pool.

428
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,580
Brian played pool with me a couple times,

429
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,460
but since then he's learned
that have considered it.

430
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,530
I considered poor two
totally different things,

431
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,251
right,

432
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:03,550
Brian?

433
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,383
Yes.

434
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,283
What's the difference?

435
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,160
You're addicted.

436
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,243
You're,

437
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,380
you're,

438
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,610
you're hardcore about it.

439
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,240
Like you do a hundred games in
a night where I'm used to like,

440
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:13,481
hey,

441
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,880
we'll just have some beer and
play a couple games of pool.

442
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,990
You're now at the bar.

443
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,680
You're like,

444
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,750
let's play 100 games and
let's be there for five.

445
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,584
Eight till five minutes.

446
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,600
Doesn't even lock until about game seven,

447
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,860
dash seven.

448
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,590
That's when he gets out and
you're in fucking trouble.

449
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,350
I got to steal a few games early.

450
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:30,580
Otherwise be a bad night.

451
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,210
Although now my hair is my wife.

452
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,040
My wife was a friend
that will delete photos.

453
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,180
You can't let her have a camera

454
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,340
in it.

455
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:40,620
Yeah.

456
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,930
She just deleted all the
pictures that don't delete that.

457
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,530
They call you the next day and say,

458
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,720
did you delete facebook?

459
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,880
I used to scour my tags and be like,

460
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,630
don't care,

461
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,021
like whatever.

462
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,580
I want to look ugly 20
percent of the time.

463
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,180
Oh,

464
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,013
that's hilarious.

465
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,101
Good.

466
00:12:56,101 --> 00:12:57,030
Eighty percent average.

467
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,340
Can't worry about what you look like,

468
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,060
your photos.

469
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,620
Don't worry about what
you actually look like.

470
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,730
You know,

471
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,563
write him.

472
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,420
If you look good in real life and they
got a picture of you like bronchitis guys

473
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,770
don't care.

474
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:08,161
Like Brian,

475
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:09,480
there's a million pictures of you.

476
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,130
How many photos of you or
they give us the faith.

477
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,650
Literally thousands of pictures
that still going on now.

478
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,450
I stopped it,

479
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,790
stopped doing it too much and then
I just found myself always doing it.

480
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:21,624
When I was around Joseph,

481
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,380
I was like,

482
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,621
all right.

483
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:23,790
People just don't ask for it though.

484
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,250
People do ask for the fish.

485
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,233
I video

486
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,740
do it and behind it

487
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,440
and ruin the pictures and you
probably do like a thousand,

488
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:36,830
right?

489
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,440
Right.

490
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,070
More than that,

491
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,650
more than the balance
of this conversation.

492
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:41,630
There's two of us filming.

493
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,590
One of them is we're all just
got to get used to the lights.

494
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,170
Rhonda Bright Lights.

495
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,250
This is what's gonna happen.

496
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,570
They're gonna be a bunch of TMZ.

497
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:52,240
Cameras.

498
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,600
So you.

499
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,433
Who Do you want to find out?

500
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,100
Who's next for Misha?

501
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,440
Misha.

502
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,850
That's the one you want to fight?

503
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,893
Her boyfriend,

504

boyfriend.

505
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,770
Brian.

506
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,200
What is that?

507
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,033
Just the ultimate shits.

508
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,810
It seemed like a really nice guy.

509
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,760
That's what you actually know.

510
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,040
The guy he fought in a

511
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,573
very nice guy.

512
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,543
Nice.

513
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:14,970
Nice.

514
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm just trying to like Brian up.

515
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,430
What was his name?

516
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,400
However you say his last name?

517
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,500
Tate Tate.

518
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,010
Pat Frank tape.

519
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,061
Oh Shit.

520
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:24,894
Okay.

521
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,983
Yeah.

522
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,110
Wow.

523
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,800
You don't like it?

524
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,590
I do like them both.

525
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:38,250
I think they're both.

526
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:38,971
Both variously.

527
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,170
I don't think they like me very much.

528
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,020
It seemed like you're very nice person
but you should very competitive.

529
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,940
Very competitive with everything.

530
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,590
I'll have to like eat,

531
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:52,310
like if we were eating lunch together
and I try to finish my lunch before you.

532
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,390
Whoa.

533
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,800
It's like everything that's weird.

534
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,121
Yeah.

535
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,460
That's my like if I know I'm
not good at it then screw it.

536
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,294
I don't care.

537
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,210
Like Michael Jordan,

538
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,690
Michael Jordan and game of checkers.

539
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,524
He fucking hates.

540
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,270
Especially shit.

541
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,020
He's trying to like pull,

542
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:13,190
apparently beat him at pool.

543
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:14,024
He doesn't want to talk to you

544
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,730
like depressing lows in like I hate.

545
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,080
I get a pool or something.

546
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,850
Then you don't want to play
me because it's so slow.

547
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,640
The other person talks.

548
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,540
Shifting your time.

549
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,390
It makes it worse if you lose
it and someone's talking to you,

550
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,450
you know,

551
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,560
but I can't make fun of
a lot for losing pool.

552
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,020
I think it's better to be good
at jumping people in their heads.

553
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,510
Like all my talent has got funneled
into one area and like any sport with a

554
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:38,871
ball,

555
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,860
I just can't do it.

556
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,340
Start doing judo twice a week.

557
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:44,174
I teach

558
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,950
dynamics in the way

559
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,660
it's like on Santa Monica Boulevard
between like Barrington and Monday.

560
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,561
Oh cool.

561
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,311
I got to go down there.

562
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:55,471
I want.

563
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:59,900
I want to train with
Antony Dutch kickboxing,

564
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,813

565
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,003
wrestling,

566
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,683
competition

567
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,373
dynamics,

568
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,293
mma.

569
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,310
You want to get thrown
in your fucking head.

570
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,633
Go find her.

571
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,053
Max.

572
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,573
I want you in here,

573
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,520
man.

574
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,980
You Max.

575
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,153
Max.

576
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,790
Put this whole thing up.

577
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,640
Although you cannot see Max on the podcast

578
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,973
because of him.

579
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,980
Assault took place.

580
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,060
So I just want to say thank you.

581
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,671
Thank you Michael.

582
00:16:58,671 --> 00:16:59,000
Rupert.

583
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,590
That was an awesome podcast.

584
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,453
A lot of fun.

585
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,630
It was very interesting.

586
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:03,920
We've got to learn a lot of shit.

587
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,970
Got To get into some squirrel magic or Fox

588
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,580
is a shocking.

589
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,480
It was scary.

590
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:13,040
It was thought provoking.

591
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,360
It was positive.

592
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,330
Even ultimately with
all the doom and gloom,

593
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:17,020
I'm still positive.

594
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,700
There's a lot of good
things happening now,

595
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,030
man.

596
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,400
They're coming out and all we gotta
do is just speak to him to see him.

597
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:25,760
How did you choose the area where you
decided to camp out up North California?

598
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,031
Oh,

599
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:26,340
I've,

600
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,160
I've had the privilege
of traveling the world,

601
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,760
looking at sustainability and all the
efforts that are taking place all over the

602
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,970
country to write and what I
find in western Oma county,

603
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,870
it's the perfect climate.

604
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,160
That's where Luther Burbank settled.

605
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:38,000
It's the right culture.

606
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:43,001
There's a strong tradition of local
food growing and permaculture and uh,

607
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,450
the kind of society I want.

608
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:49,451
And there's also a center of learning
transition towns is a US headquartered

609
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:51,000
there and Richard Wineburg,

610
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,880
a lot of people who are part of the
same effort are all living there.

611
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:55,140
So it's Kinda like a little genuine,

612
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,120
you know?

613
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,511
Really?

614
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:57,230
Yeah.

615
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:57,680
Wow.

616
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,700
And how long have you been up there?

617
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,220
Uh,

618
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,170
we moved March 30th of this year.

619
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,990
I moved out of bed.

620
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,823
It's like,

621
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:03,630
yeah,

622
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,730
you don't want to be invested.

623
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,140
You don't want to be an advancement shits.

624
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,080
I have several friends
that live in Venice,

625
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,321

627
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,871
Why would you live there?

628
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:13,411
And crazy.

629
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:14,640
That's a dangerous spot.

630
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Dangerous.

631
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,720

Dennis.

635
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,450
Great parts about it.

636
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,710
But boys a spooky Los Banos yeah.

637
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,180
The guy who sail sail boats up and
down to the western hemisphere.

638
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,181
This wild motherfucker took a sailboat
from America all the way down to South

639
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,950
America.

640
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,230
Where did you go by himself?

641
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,950
Started Oregon Hood River,

642
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:40,921
Oregon.

643
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:41,270
And where,

644
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,103
where did you end up?

645
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,530
Middle of Columbia.

646
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,750
Got a little spicy.

647
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,620
They're kind of like,

648
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:47,454

649
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,593
Well,

650
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,153
I can't.

651
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,430
It's a,

652
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,430
it's an interesting area.

653
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,010
It's a place where there's a,

654
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,350
a constant battle going on.

655
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah,

656
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,470
and the ethnic

657
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:08,090
ethnic traditions there are still strong
and I stood out with the blonde hair.

658
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,790
Let's leave it at that
and see I problems there.

659
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,043
Yeah.

660
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,280
Show up and start banging
bitches on your sailboat now.

661
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,240
There was none of that.

662
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,470
You can't do that dude.

663
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,270
Then I going to take that.

664
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,010
No white boy shows up on a boat.

665
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,780
Is that what the problem was?

666
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,730
My lucky bastard.

667
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,030
No,

668
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,670

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,720

672
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,300
Wow.

673
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,530
Well thanks for hooking this up man.

674
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,250
This is a really fun part.

675
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,311
Thank you.

676
00:19:37,311 --> 00:19:37,680
Thank you.

677
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,070
Good.

678
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,910
Let's do it again man.

679
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,230
I'm sure we could talked forever.

680
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,340
We'll do it again some time.

681
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:41,791
Definitely.

682
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,470
And if you're ever selling anything,

683
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:44,790
if you ever got a book that's coming out,

684
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,750
if you have anything,

685
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,770
please let me know.

686
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,530
Throwing out twitter.

687
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,720
We'll pump it up as much.

688
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,953
It's cool.

689
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,810
Thank you.

690
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,643
Thank you guys.

691
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,110
Hi everybody.

692
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,150
This is post podcast.

693
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,450
I'm Joe Rogan and that's everlast when
the house pain or you can call him Whitey

694
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:01,710
Ford.

695
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,570
Don't call them Erica.

696
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,413
Pretend you know him.

697
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,683
Don't get stupid.

698
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,260
Don't get all goofy man and certain
certain rules that apply when you have a

699
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,840
fake name like soulja boy,

700
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,950
you can't come up soulja boy
and call him by his real name.

701
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,060
It's like disrespectful,

702
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,020
right?

703
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,530
Unless there's.

704
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,430
What's his name?

705
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,680
Does anybody know soulja boy's room
that you've seen some of his new dances?

706
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,910
He has a new dance contests.

707
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:24,750
You learned his dance.

708
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:26,730
If you do it the best are
going to give you $100,000.

709
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,610
Oh,

710
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,441
who's this kid getting?

711
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:29,274
It's kind of bread.

712
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,300
He's getting by like a
$50,000,000 check everyone gets,

713
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,090
but listen to your records
or not get your money.

714
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,590
Just has a good printer.

715
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,293
Is Printing money

716
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,300
stacks and it's like,

717
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,650
did he make it a lot of money?

718
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,040
He's selling out concerts.

719
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:48,340
He's.

720
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,173
He's huge.

721
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,810
He's got like,

722
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,490
who knows how many million
twitter followers now,

723
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,420
how many millions do you have?

724
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,890
Got a lot of twitter followers.

725
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,430
Right?

726
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,540
So he's got all that going on.

727
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,320
He's got,

728
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,970
you know,

729
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,480
he's selling out all these arenas,

730
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:58,811
you know,

731
00:20:58,811 --> 00:20:59,850
if you're selling out arenas,

732
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,070
you haven't going a lot of fucking money.

733
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,950
Why of people come and see soulja boy
concerts that I can't think of selling out

734
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:06,400
of the,

735
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,061
out of the loop,

736
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:07,291
man.

737
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,124
I'm sorry.

738
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,210
I've got to think of selling
out pretty big places.

739
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,320
Soulja boy's got killed.

740
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,870
So when you bought $50,000,000
jets that what he did,

741
00:21:13,871 --> 00:21:15,790
he bought a $50 million
dollars for his birthday.

742
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,510
That was like the last
news I heard about it,

743
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,490
but maybe he lines and maybe got
like conditions like partnership,

744
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,600
fractional ownership.

745
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,810
One of those things and shit.

746
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,240
Boy,

747
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,190
Jay Jay apparently with that
stupid fucking that Superman,

748
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,720
which is catchy,

749
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,390
but I really $50,000,000
jet for that song,

750
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:39,224
but it's amazing.

751
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,713
How do you do it?

752
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,550
Seems like it's having a good time.

753
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,440
He'd selling out like where?

754
00:21:43,441 --> 00:21:44,500
Like the staples center.

755
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,280
I don't know.

756
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,740
We have to,

757
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,010
we have to look up to
be honest about that,

758
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,210
to give a good statement,

759
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,880
but you know it.

760
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,350
You know what he's pushing those
that he's having a good time.

761
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,250
You know what,

762
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,083
he's pushing this,

763
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,120
he's out there,

764
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,930
they're sociable and he's having fun.

765
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,950
He's got his pants down here
and because pants like sagging,

766
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:04,480
like literally down to
his dick and he's silly.

767
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:05,290
It's a silly boy.

768
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,110
Completely unthreatening
skinny nonviolent.

769
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,030
Not talking about beating anybody up
and just catching on like wild fire,

770
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,310
you know,

771
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,960
and just found a niche family,

772
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:15,760
like some area that people want to hear.

773
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,530
Not that I'm,

774
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,103
I haven't bought it.

775
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,833
Well you're not,

776
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,430
you're not a 17 year old black girl,

777
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,130
girl,

778
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:25,570
girl,

779
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,030
girl,

780
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,863
girl,

781
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:27,760
girl thing.

782
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,740
Well there's a lot of girls that like,

783
00:22:28,741 --> 00:22:29,574
I'm just pretty boy.

784
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,191
That's this thing.

785
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:31,024
Pretty much swag.

786
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,043
And you love him.

787
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,550
I think he's having a good time.

788
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,070
I wouldn't mind hanging
out with that dude.

789
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:39,620
There you go.

790
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,990
Put it wasn't loaded.

791
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,440
Boy.

792
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,700
Joe Rosa and I hope it's front of me.

793
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,980
Seems like a friendly guy.

794
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,230
He sounds like he has no complaints.

795
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,120
Like you're pouty lips.

796
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,300
So the dollar jets.

797
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,100
And how long can we keep this up?

798
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,850
A little bit behind the music.

799
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,660
You guys still touring as a house of pain?

800
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,520
We did like a 20th
anniversary thing this year.

801
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,250
Oh yeah.

802
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:10,811
Six months.

803
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:12,310
I told her I get to do more of those.

804
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,780
Um,

805
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,660
that's like a kiss thing
where you can keep doing that.

806
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,740
You keep bringing that back
it out every once in a while.

807
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,310
Get happy around St Patty's Day.

808
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:22,790
And do like a week's worth of data.

809
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,070
You do it in Boston or
if we did well we did

810
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,390
kind of big return thing
we did was Dana's party.

811
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:32,981
Yeah man,

812
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:33,610
I was pissed.

813
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,750
I had a date already booked,

814
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:39,460
a comedy date already booked and it
was St Patrick's Day in Boston with the

815
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,294
house of pain.

816
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,010
It must have been a lot
of concussions that night.

817
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,140
Not really because it wasn't.

818
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,100
Know if I would've done anything over,

819
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,320
I would have opened it up to the.

820
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,700
It wasn't,

821
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,230
it was like a Dana private of.

822
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,580
Oh yeah,

823
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,350
it was fun.

824
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,590
It was a good time.

825
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:53,401
Everybody was fine,

826
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:58,030
but I'm saying like the knuckleheads
didn't get in last night,

827
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,590
but we did one.

828
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,670
We did one last year.

829
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,033
That's when.

830
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,770
Yeah.

831
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,120
Your music is synonymous with bar fights,

832
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,503
you know,

833
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,903
it's fun.

834
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,650
Yeah.

835
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,483
Yeah,

836
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:11,790
everybody wants to die,

837
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,440
right?

838
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,990
Yeah.

839
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,570
That was the first video where I was like,

840
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:14,811
cool.

841
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:16,540
That was cool to have a quarter Irish,

842
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,480
Irish last name was cool to
be a little bit of Irish.

843
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,021
Cool Dude.

844
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,760
He had always been cool
at certain neighborhoods,

845
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,110
but now it's National Celtics
Jerseys flew off the shelf.

846
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,580
That was just really awesome.

847
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:30,340
White boy shit.

848
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:30,790
Tuesday.

849
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:33,180
I've always been a laker
fan that trips people out,

850
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,880
but I wore the Celtics Jersey because
it was the Larry Bird thing like,

851
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:37,030
yeah,

852
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,863
we the bed

853
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,591
bad,

854
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:43,280
baddest white boys and the girl that
was that statement was hilarious.

855
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,540
He used Larry Bird is here.

856
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,320
That's right.

857
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
As you're the baddest white dude.

858
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,230
I love when he used to come to those
three point contest and you would go or

859
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,160
who's coming in second.

860
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,060
All right,

861
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,893
let me just show up.

862
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,090
You got to scale those three
throw contest and he goes,

863
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:56,924
who's coming in second?

864
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,930
First Bitch reading streets all day,

865
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:00,764
man.

866
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,810
Thanks for doing the podcast was awesome.

867
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,013
Say,

868
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:06,520
Oh gee,

869
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,490
everlast on twitter.

870
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,190
Hey.

871
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,890
Hey everybody.

872
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,350
We're post podcasts where my pal Brian.

873
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,551
That's right.

874
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,384
Ladies and gentlemen,

875
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,261
I am in the,

876
00:25:14,261 --> 00:25:14,550
uh,

877
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,610
in the cage right now,

878
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,130
Joe Rogan.

879
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,170
We had a good time today.

880
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,570
What's important?

881
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:19,841
Yeah,

882
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:24,360
a lot of weird shit and most importantly
brined cow and let us know he's going

883
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:25,480
to go back to training.

884
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,860
A lot of people say,

885
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,760
Hey Brian,

886
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:27,910
I'm,

887
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,181
you know,

888
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,260
train them more.

889
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,550
But I train a lot now and
just to roll it ties up a lot.

890
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,910
A lot of stand up.

891
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:34,331
Yeah.

892
00:25:34,331 --> 00:25:35,470
But meanwhile I,

893
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,750
if I get punched in the nose,

894
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,550
I got sucks.

895
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,750
It's bad for you.

896
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,680
Can't really transfer over
for me and let's be honest,

897
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:43,780
but it's just getting your nose broken.

898
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:44,710
It's such a huge pain.

899
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47,600
That deck or it comes to going to
the doctor and get straight to.

900
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:48,690
Yeah.

901
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,570
I have a friend who had a tongue ring and
his tongue ring somewhere else through

902
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:53,111
sleeping.

903
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:54,280
Cracked a couple of his teeth.

904
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
So they had extracted teeth,

905
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,831
so he lost,

906
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:58,960
like to have a side teeth
because of a tongue ring.

907
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,720
You can't stop shooting when by the way,

908
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:04,210
I broke my nose and I can
or I knocked my teeth out.

909
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,320
We have what he did,

910
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,030
but they give you like fake
teeth for a little bit.

911
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,470
It's really to do that.

912
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:08,870
Yeah.

913
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,000
They have to shut down production.

914
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,390
They could do it pretty quickly I think
give you like a little little bread,

915
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:15,820
but I don't want to fuck dude,

916
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:16,654
that's a drag.

917
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,670
I do love training or I miss it a lot.

918
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,530
So I've been doing it a
little bit and it's been fun.

919
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,940
But didn't you have
like a crazy concussion?

920
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,320
Yeah.

921
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
What you thought you
were going to last time?

922
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:24,930
I.

923
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,020
I've framed heavy.

924
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:26,620
Yeah.

925
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,880
I don't care.

926
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:28,451
You know now.

927
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:29,021
Now I don't care.

928
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,870
Now he's just kind of keep you keep doing
it and you do it at your own pace and

929
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:34,020
you can learn a lot better now.

930
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,830
I'll get better now because I don't care.

931
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,880
Because you're not a nut either.

932
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:37,720
You were spastic.

933
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,810
I remember when you rolled with Sergio
Colon and you've got so rough with him

934
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:42,640
and he fucking head butted head
about me and broke my nose.

935
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:42,930
Yeah.

936
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,130
What did you let you do that?

937
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,050
I was taking a.

938
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,360
well,

939
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,090
because I was in there
taking guys down cause I was,

940
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,821
I was arrested wrestler,

941
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:48,001
right.

942
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:48,900
So I'll take these guys.

943
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:49,171
I was like,

944
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:49,381
ah,

945
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,710
you don't know him that I was doing like
weird shit that doesn't work against

946
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,101
wrestlers,

947
00:26:53,101 --> 00:26:53,934
but they'd never done stuff.

948
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:57,890
Like one time I took a guy here I can't
remember and I ducked under and pulled

949
00:26:57,891 --> 00:26:59,850
this way and just flew over
and he didn't know what to do.

950
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:03,750
So I was doing really obnoxious shit
and Sergio and I got in this thing and I

951
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:05,010
didn't have any respect for just do to,

952
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,600
I didn't know anything and he kind of,

953
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,300
he kinda,

954
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,650
we went against the wall and he was trying
to take me down but he didn't know he

955
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:15,780
wasn't doing a lot of take downs or
something and I threw my hand into his

956
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,790
fucking that was just to tick.

957
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,721
And he goes,

958
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,000
he took it out of the way and he's like.

959
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,460
And then we went to the ground and the
little bucket and he put me in an arm bar

960
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:24,294
but he let me go.

961
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,350
He would have killed me,

962
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,480
but I was too stupid
to know the difference.

963
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,020
It happens.

964
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,411
A lot of.

965
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:28,731
Gosh,

966
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:31,740
there's a lot of guys to get
real personal chat though.

967
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:32,610
You don't mean I don't care.

968
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:32,821
I mean,

969
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:32,950
but.

970
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,780
But I just got excited and I've
seen people dig into people's eyes.

971
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:41,080
Would like hands accidentally tap and
they're like as the defending but like

972
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,130
digging noxious.

973
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,320
What are you doing man?

974
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,391
Just tasks.

975
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:45,990
Not a war,

976
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,300
which already we'll do
a lot of creepy shit.

977
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,621
No more taste stuff,

978
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,454
buddy.

979
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,450
Keep finding more gay thing stuff.

980
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,930
The fact that you might have sucked on
Barris cock on the outside about 30 or 40

981
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:55,990
years.

982
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,761
What's on the outside?

983
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:57,620
It was a mock suck.

984
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,530
Let's be honest.

985
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,150
The whole area story though.

986
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,890
That was funny as it gets,

987
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,241
right?

988
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah.

989
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,690
When you go start your own podcast.

990
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,270
I'm going to start my
own podcast next month.

991
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:06,980
Next week,

992
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,600
next week.

993
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,011
Next week.

994
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:08,371
We're doing it.

995
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,171
And you're my first guys.

996
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:09,370
Okay.

997
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,830
What would was going to be called?

998
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,400
It's going to be called
the questions with Brian.

999
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,870
Questions with Bryan
County sharks in questions.

1000
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,940
I'm going to ask you questions and
it's going to be all kinds of names.

1001
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:18,840
Should be in the beginning.

1002
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,340
Brian Cowen questions,

1003
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:20,800
Ryan,

1004
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,220
count your neighbors.

1005
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,510
Importance Barton.

1006
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,360
Countless questions.

1007
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,890
That's it.

1008
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,680
That's it right there.

1009
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,341
Brian Collins.

1010
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:27,174
Questions.

1011
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:27,661
Beautiful.

1012
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:27,780
It's.

1013
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,291
We just got.

1014
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,100
We just got the nail.

1015
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,470
My,

1016
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,780
your name is on the front of it.

1017
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,150
That's really important that
people know who the fuck you are,

1018
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:33,630
right?

1019
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:33,811
Yeah.

1020
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:35,220
Well you've been tagged teaching me about.

1021
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,510
I'm so lazy with that stuff,

1022
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:37,660
but it's important because you know,

1023
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,520
you want to get your.

1024
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:38,970
It's,

1025
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,900
it's fun to get an audience and in
connection with those people to,

1026
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,300
you know,

1027
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,710
not just the podcast but twitter,

1028
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:44,221
all that stuff.

1029
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:44,431
You know,

1030
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,330
you're interacting with people.

1031
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,610
I'm really anxious and
people really appreciate it.

1032
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:47,740
Which,

1033
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,600
so it surprised me.

1034
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,660
I had no idea that so many people listen
to your podcasts and I did it when I do

1035
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:53,550
the show and people
come up to me and they,

1036
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,400
and they,

1037
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,700
they thanked me here.

1038
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,570
They say I listen to
on the Rogan podcasts.

1039
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,650
It's a powerful medium.

1040
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:59,010
You know,

1041
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,671
it's amazing.

1042
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:03,360
We've never had anything like it before
in human history as far as we know,

1043
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,620
the idea that you can just have a pirate
radio show and it's legal for now.

1044
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,330
It's been talking about that before.

1045
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:10,801
It's illegal.

1046
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,780
Brian Sopa,

1047
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,160
he thinks so motherfuckers,

1048
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,363
they're going to say,

1049
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,120
yeah,

1050
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,760
we got to get bigger and bigger to
the point where they can't stop it.

1051
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,511
The ceiling.

1052
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,090
Hope there are big enough to the
point where when it rolls around,

1053
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:24,940
it's too big stuff.

1054
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:25,590
I mean,

1055
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,341
that's exactly right.

1056
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:26,701
You've got to.

1057
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:27,534
You've got to figure out.

1058
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,740
They want to pass legislation.

1059
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:29,760
It's going to make the problem better.

1060
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:30,570
Probably not.

1061
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:30,751
Well,

1062
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:34,320
there's also people that are interested
in launching their own satellites for

1063
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:35,640
communication and for Internet.

1064
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,660
If they shut down the Internet.

1065
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:39,050
There's private companies that
are talking about doing that.

1066
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:39,841
The Tesla Guy,

1067
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:40,674
in fact,

1068
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,130
who started paypal,

1069
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,360
he has a company that
launches a private satellites,

1070
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,250
so they're going to come up with a way
to keep the internet going no matter

1071
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:48,520
what.

1072
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,321
At this point in time.

1073
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,820
It's too many companies like,

1074
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,250
like Google's antisocial,

1075
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,610
right?

1076
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,443
Aren't they?

1077
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:53,951
I mean,

1078
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:54,251
come on,

1079
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,670
man.

1080
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,510
If Google's anti,

1081
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
so for that is also because you
can technically under that law,

1082
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,510
hold them accountable for
things and they're like,

1083
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,383
you know,

1084
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:02,850
my,

1085
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,720
my website would essentially
have to shut down.

1086
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,003
I couldn't.

1087
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,300
I couldn't keep all those.

1088
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,270
A toric stream.

1089
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,921
By the way,

1090
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,020
we've done just fine without
government intervention.

1091
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,720
We've done just fine so we don't need.

1092
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,420
We don't need a yet another
group of government laws.

1093
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,351
It's so gross.

1094
00:30:17,351 --> 00:30:22,351
Everything is regulated nowadays is
stand up comedy and fucking that's it.

1095
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,460
There's not much.

1096
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,720
There's not much that make sense anymore.

1097
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,491
It's weird.

1098
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,520
We're in a really weird
time where they're,

1099
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:29,500
they're scrambling,

1100
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:30,041
like you said,

1101
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,000
40,000 laws.

1102
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:31,840
They passed last year.

1103
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,520
Human beings figure themselves out.

1104
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:33,791
They can.

1105
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,091
We can.

1106
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:34,924
We can get along.

1107
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,071
And by the way,

1108
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:40,780
one of the other things is that that human
beings actually and even primates are

1109
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,030
very good at cooperation
and working together.

1110
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,811
Like we said,

1111
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:45,790
there's always going to be
people who do the wrong thing,

1112
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:46,630
but for the most part,

1113
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:47,730
if you look at the way society is working,

1114
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:51,430
if you look at the way people actually
behave in in catastrophes like tsunamis

1115
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,090
and things,

1116
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,500
they don't panic and running the streets.

1117
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,300
They actually work together
and help each other.

1118
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,630
They get very calm and they start
helping each other and they become very

1119
00:30:58,631 --> 00:30:59,464
communal

1120
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,020
social and that's how we've survived
through the millennia by cooperating with

1121
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:05,321
each other,

1122
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,400
by forming societies,

1123
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,560
by forming rules for those Saturdays,

1124
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,390
and we didn't need these huge central
bodies organizing and running,

1125
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,150
instructing the money from the system.

1126
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:19,090
You twats I see half my money.

1127
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,530
One love bitches does squad.
