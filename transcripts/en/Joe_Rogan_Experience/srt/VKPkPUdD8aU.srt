1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,780
How should you behave on Facebook
and how should you behave on Twitter?

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,360
I think Twitter drives
me a little bit crazy,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,530
you know,

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,880
um,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,100
I'm on it a fair bit.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,650
I'm not sure it's a good thing.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,390
And I tend to distribute
things that are alarming,

8
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,330
let's say in some sense maybe
they are alarming ideological,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,560
ideologically,

10
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,460
they're disturbing.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,970
And I was thinking about that
today in preparation for this talk.

12
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,590
And I wasn't really sure
that was necessarily a good
idea because there are a

13
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,050
lot of alarming things
happening all the time,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,670
everywhere obviously.

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,973
Um,

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,530
and now we can share all of
them always all the time.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,850
And so that means that instead of
hearing about one alarming thing a day,

18
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,490
you're hearing about like
500 alarming things a day.

19
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,324
And so then,

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,433
you know,

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,820
what are you supposed to do about that?

22
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,181
Is that,

23
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:57,150
does that indicate the state that
there's a state of emergency?

24
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:57,810
Well,

25
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,300
you don't know cause you don't know
how to calibrate the information.

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,321
So I was thinking,

27
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:05,280
well maybe the right way to behave on
Twitter is only two forward good things

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,061
that are happening.

29
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:06,301
You know,

30
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,190
cause there's lots of good
things that are happening.

31
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,140
But I actually don't
know the answer to that.

32
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,251
I,

33
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:11,130
I have no idea.

34
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:12,810
And I don't think
anybody else does either.

35
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,650
I do know that there are studies with
regards to Facebook that showed that the

36
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:18,300
more time that you spend on Facebook,

37
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:22,050
the more depressed you are and that it
looks like it's a causal relationship

38
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,060
rather than just a
correlational relationship.

39
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:28,140
And it seems to have something to do with
the fact that Facebook is one of those

40
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,290
platforms where everybody puts up
an advertisement for their life.

41
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:31,501
Right?

42
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,040
It's like,

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,330
here I am with my new girlfriend in The
Bahamas being happy and here I am in a

44
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:37,350
mountain being happy.

45
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:37,950
And it's like,

46
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,980
it's not you like miserable
with the cover over your head,

47
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,450
unable to get out of bed.

48
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,870
You don't,

49
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,703
you don't,

50
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,150
you don't broadcast that.

51
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:45,751
You can think,

52
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,584
well,

53
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,730
it means you're presenting people with
a falsely positive view of your life and

54
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:53,970
then they compare their lives to it
and they come up short and you think,

55
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,470
well that's a kind of deception.

56
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,390
But by the same token,

57
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:00,420
you don't stop random strangers on the
street and tell them how miserable your

58
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:00,991
life is.

59
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:01,290
Right?

60
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,490
They don't want to hear about that.

61
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:02,880
They,

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,790
they want to see a facade of normality in,

63
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:06,181
in,

64
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:06,630
in,

65
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,991
you know,

66
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,270
just casual day to day interactions.

67
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:13,920
And so part of pro social behavior
is only to put what's at least,

68
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,370
you know,

69
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,110
normative and good forward.

70
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,420
So it doesn't matter.

71
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:18,930
I mean,

72
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,880
so I don't think that's
necessarily deception,

73
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,420
but the mass consequences of that is
something that we don't understand at all.

74
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,763
And so,

75
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,730
well,

76
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,170
so with that sort of introduction,

77
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm going to kind of walk you through my
experience with social media and let's

78
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:34,260
say the old media,

79
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,520
for lack of a better word,

80
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:38,310
and I'll try to give you a
balanced account and to tell you,

81
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,451
well,

82
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,030
it's to see if I can draw some
conclusions about what's happening.
