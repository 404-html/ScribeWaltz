1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,290
Don't,
don't,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,890
don't,
don't,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,480
don't,
don't,

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,150
don't,
don't,

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,830
don't,
don't,

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,710
don't,
don't,

7
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:09,841
don't,
don't,

8
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:10,674
don't,
don't,

9
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,200
don't,
don't,

10
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,230
don't,
don't,

11
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,663
don't,
don't,

12
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,130
don't,
don't,

13
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,050
don't,
don't what happened.

14
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,970
But this was a heterosexual top 40 song
and then all of a sudden who said my

15
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,020
Dick,
who said that?

16
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,440
What happened?
I apologize that just popped out.

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,220
No Pun intended.
You fuck you feel if the animals,

18
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,260
he's back from Italy.
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,840
I'm back from the south of France.
Man.

20
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,240
We both went to Europe.
Very cultured,

21
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,100
very close.
Drink wine over there.

22
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,210
Of course I did.
Did you what you did you contact the

23
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,044
symbol?
Yay.

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,050
And then just let him know how much you
know.

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,950
No,
I didn't need to,

26
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,420
cause I was with a very rich friends.
It,

27
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,760
we just,
I just throw a dart at a cellar and I

28
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,710
took how insanely good wines.

29
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,990
I like one of those,
Oh forget it.

30
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,660
I was like,
I was saying shit like this.

31
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,540
I was like,
oh I smelled nutmeg and pencil

32
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,980
cause that's what I've heard people say.
They get mad at you and you.

33
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,430
Of course,
they came after me and then I took a,

34
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,480
then I sit some white wine.
I went,

35
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,610
whoa.
I feel like I just got hit in the head

36
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:16,440
with by a farmer.
I love saying dumb shit like that to try

37
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,530
and do a wine tasting bars,
like one of those,

38
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,030
those parties where they all get around
and they all talk about it.

39
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,910
How,
you know what I heard Smia say you trust

40
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,750
me on this one.
I said,

41
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:28,410
why?
Because he,

42
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,080
I was going to order our white whining.
It's unique.

43
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,710
I said,
well,

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,610
describe it.
He goes,

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,100
it's like biting into a wet dog.
I'll say,

46
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,030
hey,
that's exactly what I feel like

47
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,300
he was telling you that it's good.

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,320
It's like getting,
getting biting into a wet dog.

50
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,450
People.
He's done.

51
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,290
Shane.
I'd like good wine.

52
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,820
It tastes good.
I like that.

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,330
Yeah.
There's a part of me that rejects the

54
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,460
fucking,
the nonsense so hard.

55
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,130
Well,
it shouldn't anything as well.

56
00:01:58,131 --> 00:02:00,290
It should.
You should always reject that horse

57
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,330
shit,
but it sits.

58
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,420
It's so fucking pretentious.
Of course,

59
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:06,090
it's pretentious.
Think most pretentious here,

60
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,661
these,
the here,

61
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,710
the way they describe it,
it really holds you a pallet prison.

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,260
It holds your palate prisoner.
But here's the good news in a velvet

63
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,350
casing.
Oh,

64
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,250
speaking of velvet casings,
I was at a restaurant once,

65
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:19,890
a very fun restaurant and fairphone
Italian restaurant,

66
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,310
and a gentleman walked in with a
briefcase with two bottles of wine and

67
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,590
velvet in the briefcase.
I had to resist the chimpanzee urge to

68
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,000
over the table and smashed him in his
fucking head with that case.

69
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,100
But here's the thing,
here's the thing about that.

70
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
Here's the thing,
and here's the reason I support him

71
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,240
because I'm such a freak for one.
You cannot send $1,000 bottle of wine.

72
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,300
Uh,
you can't ship it because a lot of times

73
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,330
they put it in the hall of a ship and it
comes through,

74
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,580
say the Suez Canal gets hyper.
Yeah,

75
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,580
it might be 150 degrees in that hall.
Not Good.

76
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,010
And it's below or above the waterline.
You're in trouble.

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,570
So they fly that wine,
you can be fucked.

78
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,380
Yeah,
you it.

79
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,560
But this guy,
he just was bringing it to a restaurant,

80
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,850
kind of a dick.
This is kind of,

81
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,980
it's kind of a weird move.
And You bring your own food to a

82
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,250
restaurant.
I mean,

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,600
I guess it's a drink,
but it's not like you bring your own

84
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,680
tomatoes.
Excuse me.

85
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:14,290
Could you tell the chef to chop these
tomatoes?

86
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,510
Yeah,
a parallel with the floor.

87
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,550
I've never brought my own one.
I tell him it's,

88
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:20,560
it's obnoxious.
The establishment.

89
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,670
Yeah,
it's weird.

90
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,750
Yeah,
it is weird.

91
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,790
And then they have a corkage fee.
They charge you to open your won $35

92
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,070
that's fairly reasonable.
Well,

93
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,960
it's just if you're bringing $1,000
bottle of wine,

94
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,740
you know,
but I don't understand why one wine,

95
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,020
I do understand,
but I don't understand why someone is

96
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,520
willing to pay.
But I do understand it.

97
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,170
I do.
Because you want to be a part of that

98
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,760
fuck head club.
Well,

99
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,200
if you're,
and if you're a freak,

100
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,360
like man,
you like wine on that level when you

101
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:50,680
really pay attention it for me,
I actually,

102
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,810
it's,
I didn't even know how to describe it.

103
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,730
It's literally an experience,
right?

104
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,780
I tell you.
So my buddy,

105
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:59,030
I went to see who's made more money than
God and this is why he's,

106
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
I don't know if I told you this,
so all the money,

107
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,440
you know what I mean?

108
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,980
He has as much money as bruce
springsteen almost and a probably.

109
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,540
And uh,
he,

110
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,010
uh,
super rich and he,

111
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,860
I told you that he said,
we're going to open this,

112
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,370
this wine that Robert Parker gave a
hundred out of a hundred and called it

113
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,440
one of the wines of the century.
Who is Robert Park?

114
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:19,810
Robert Parker is the critic who sets the
standard.

115
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:21,130
There are a lot of eat that,
you know that,

116
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,671
yeah,
I know.

117
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm terrible.
Really bothers me.

118
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,780
I know,
but when you see an RP Robert Parker and

119
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:27,330
it has a 93,
94,

120
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,170
five,
you're paying a lot of money.

121
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,210
I want to hang out with Robert Parker.
Well,

122
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,240
he's a guy,
I think he's from Maryland and he's an

123
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:37,330
American dude and he's got his taste.
It doesn't mean he's right.

124
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,030
It just means he knows wine and he set
the standard.

125
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,960
Now there are more people,
but for the most part when Robert Park

126
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:47,220
gives your wine and 95 or above God,
why I hit him with a brick.

127
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,040
Hey,
hey.

128
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,530
Yeah.
Oh my God.

129
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,260
Did you think he says snarky things when
you go to dinner with him?

130
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,840
Well he,
he'll say for example the one I was

131
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,760
drinking,
he called it a century and one,

132
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:02,761
one of the wines of the century.
So don't try to please don't try to buy

133
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:07,660
it because you know you can't find it.
Is he the Tony Hawk of wine connoisseurs

134
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,530
as he is because nobody knows anyone
that's gates other than Tony Hawk.

135
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,460
That's,
that's actually,

136
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,530
that's exactly what he is.
That's exactly what it is.

137
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,950
And the Lance Armstrong of wine.
Yes.

138
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,930
And there are people who are trying to
make their way and,

139
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,700
and real critics,
but for the most part he's still the

140
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,010
man.
How much does it Piss people off?

141
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,450
Who,
who ride bikes,

142
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,310
who like are really good and no one
gives a fuck about them cause there's

143
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,330
not Lance Armstrong,
there's one guy,

144
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,460
there was Greg Lamont for awhile.

145
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,470
I remember he was also an American.
We remember him,

146
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,333
but you know,
nobody,

147
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,640
nobody.
I think part of it's also because he was

148
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:42,340
an American and so dominant and I'm,
and it's not,

149
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,340
you know,
Americans don't watch bike racing.

150
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,050
I could never stand on the sideline and
be like,

151
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,940
how long aisles keep on him.
I must keep bundling.

152
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,800
You know,
here's a water one,

153
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,630
an orange.
I'm not that guy.

154
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,950
Life is too short to watch a fucking
bike.

155
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:01,370
Race is definitely too short to be
watching on the sidelines,

156
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,750
like waiting.
It's that.

157
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,690
That's how I feel about marathons,
but Europeans are so different than we

158
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:08,540
are in that sense.
Would Europeans obsess over Formula One

159
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,510
they obsess over?
That's different than a formula one is

160
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,740
fucking why.
Yeah,

161
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,480
it's wild.
You ever seen those videos?

162
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,120
They do from inside the cockpit of a
Formula One car.

163
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,570
It's crazy,
but there's some old lightening fast

164
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,390
decision making going on there,
but when Senate died,

165
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,210
if you look at the streets of Brazil for
his funeral,

166
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,240
it was something that you would never
see in the United States.

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,080
If you have a great race car driver,
like say a great nascar driver,

168
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,810
you wouldn't see,
I think it was some crazy number of

169
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,370
people that showed up in the streets of
Brazil.

170
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,140
Well,
the Brazilians are insanely

171
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:42,050
nationalistic.
They love their country.

172
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,460
They're very,
very patriotic.

173
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:46,310
So when someone comes along like Sena
who dominates something that's

174
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,280
traditionally a European dominated
sport,

175
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,950
like Formula One,
and he was a wild man,

176
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,350
you said a documentary on him.
I didn't there.

177
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,970
Look at that funeral.
Wow.

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,500
Look at that.
And he was,

179
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:58,250
uh,
you know,

180
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,960
he was the guy who,
who could have been a playboy,

181
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,310
but he never really messed with girls.

182
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,920
He was,
he was,

183
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,530
he was,
uh,

184
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,560
a Samurai who's dedicated.
Yeah.

185
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,650
His,
his ability to shave milliseconds,

186
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,650
you know,
and just to take crazy chances and cut

187
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,620
people off and Oh yeah,
Jesus Christ,

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,150
that precision.
But that's a,

189
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,970
that is something that,
I don't know anything about it,

190
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,460
but I'm sure when you follow it and that
sort of,

191
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,540
those,
those millimeters,

192
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,060
those differences are what make
everything,

193
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,740
you know,
when you have a cultivated sense,

194
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:31,190
when you know what you're looking at.
And what looking for it's a,

195
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,810
it must be very enjoyable.
Well,

196
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,811
they have a deep connection with how
much traction there is exactly on those

197
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,940
tires feel like they feel it kicking
out.

198
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,721
Like they,
they,

199
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:45,830
they literally say with race car drivers
that you have to have an educated ass.

200
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,940
Damn.
Really?

201
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,610
Yeah.
Your ass has to be able to feel when

202
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:50,930
your car is breaking loose.

203
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,390
Like if you are a race car driver and
you had a numb ass,

204
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,340
you'd probably be fucked.
Wow.

205
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,890
Like if you had like Sciatica or
something and asked went numb,

206
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,000
which I would imagine it'd be a real
problem with someone who sits down all

207
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,750
the time.
Yeah.

208
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,920
They're truck drivers,
right?

209
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,170
They get Sciatica or all the time,
but race car drivers itself,

210
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,690
physical,
physical,

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,970
they lose so much water.
They lose like somebody like seven

212
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:12,470
pounds of water or something in inner
race.

213
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,180
Oh,
I would imagine the crazy sweat like a

214
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:14,841
pig.
Yeah.

215
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,820
It's hot as fuck.
They don't have air conditioning in that

216
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,361
thing.
Yeah.

217
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,620
There's giant engine.

218
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,100
They're flying down the road.
Lazy.

219
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,091
Oh,
it's mad.

220
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:25,280
It's so interesting that you have to
have an educated ass.

221
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,250
Cause I think horseback riding,
if you watch high,

222
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,650
high level jumpers,
they,

223
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,090
you know,
are just Saje guys.

224
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,050
They,
they,

225
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,170
it's the same exact thing.
It's all feel literally it looks like

226
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,840
they're doing nothing.
So the differences between the best in

227
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:43,310
the world and the number 300 you and I
could never tell the difference because

228
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:44,450
they don't look like they're doing
anything.

229
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,290
Literally.
They're just,

230
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,480
they look like for me,
they look like they're sitting upright

231
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,600
very still as why I could never ride a
horse and just,

232
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:52,910
there's nothing going on.
But the details,

233
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,220
those little like where are they placed?
The micro,

234
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,550
how they micromanage that saddle and the
signals they're sending to the horse

235
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,370
with their hands,
their legs and their ass is a whole

236
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,000
different thing.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,830
That's so often the case though with
things.

238
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,780
Would things look effortless because the
people that are awesome at them do it so

239
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:12,660
smoothly that it just,
you know,

240
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,090
you can't appreciate it unless you,
you actually do it.

241
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,320
That's what I love about life.
That's literally what I love about,

242
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,030
you know,
and it sounds silly,

243
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:26,031
but you can touch a little of that in
anything you do when you,

244
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,170
um,
you know,

245
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,520
when you practice something you're not
good at.

246
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,650
So tennis,
I always talking about tennis unboxing.

247
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,050
Am I good at boxing and tennis?
No.

248
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,250
Do I obsess over where my feet are?
Do I have cess over my grip with the

249
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:38,881
right,
it's,

250
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,280
it's,
I swear to God the actual,

251
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,490
maybe the actual activity is secondary
to how I love to work on the little

252
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,881
details and get better through daily
attendance through daily practice

253
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,550
because something happens to me that
reaches beyond that sport.

254
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,270
So when I do something that I'm maybe a
little afraid of or maybe I'm not good

255
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,570
at,
it forces me to think in a way that

256
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:07,410
informs the other things in my life that
I make a living at.

257
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:11,250
I do better at Standup,
I write better when I pushed myself in

258
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,380
these other areas.
It's really interesting.

259
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,360
Yeah,
it totally makes sense because I think

260
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,980
very difficult endeavors.
You know,

261
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,480
whatever,
whatever it is that you're trying to do.

262
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,450
Any fucking dance.
Yeah.

263
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,320
If you were trying to be a ballerina,
which I am.

264
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,340
Are you?
Yeah,

265
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,470
keep calling.
I thought you were done with that.

266
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,920
[inaudible] Bella is my foundation,
but I'm so passionate.

267
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,800
I live,
I live,

268
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,830
there's too much a quatre in me.
I live in my groin,

269
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:34,200
so I had to move to southside Madang.
Well,

270
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:38,520
people that get really get into Jujitsu
say that as well for has been saying

271
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,130
that a lot.

272
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,700
But you know,
getting into it is to him it's a lot

273
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:45,690
like writing in some ways or it's so,
it's almost like a meditation and it

274
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,760
completely obsessed it.
A Lot,

275
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,460
lot of people that get into Jujitsu
become completely obsessed with it too.

276
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,770
And it's for those same reasons.
Like you get obsessed,

277
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:56,280
first of all,
with how deep the rabbit hole goes.

278
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,970
Yes.
That's probably the same with tennis or

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,640
with golf.
It's most certainly the same.

280
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,550
I've never played golf,
but I know the people that exactly the

281
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,840
same thing I talked to will jerky will
durkee,

282
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:05,610
you know,
uh,

283
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,650
he won,
he took second in the,

284
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:10,140
uh,
10th planet Jiu Jitsu Tournament over

285
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,090
and in Austin.
He's amazing.

286
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:13,800
He's a professional poker player as
well.

287
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:17,790
And he was a d one wrestler,
I think out of Virginia and you know,

288
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,290
watching him,
um,

289
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,670
he lost to a,
uh,

290
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,770
another guy who was really good but,
but just barely.

291
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,990
And when you watch those high level,
high level competition,

292
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,540
black belts,
which I'd never seen the subtlety,

293
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,420
I don't even see what they're doing.
I didn't even see them tapping the guy.

294
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,700
Right.
But he was talking to me about how much

295
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:37,170
he loves games and why poker and Jujitsu
inform each other.

296
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,070
We know Josh Waitzkin same thing.
Same thing with chess.

297
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,520
Gee,
he's a Jujitsu.

298
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,393
Yeah.
Phenomenal.

299
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,250
If you know him well,
he's trying,

300
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,650
I think he has a school where he teaches
kids how to think.

301
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,750
You can cause it to,
he teaches them how to learn through

302
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,430
martial arts.
Math,

303
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,740
I know martial arts,
music and chess.

304
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,690
I,
and it's all kind of the same.

305
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,130
It's kind of the same thing.
It's kind of why I feel like a lot of

306
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:03,460
times that I do think there's a place
for self help and you know,

307
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,140
inspiration when you're young.

308
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,990
But after a while,
you know,

309
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,290
just trying to get really good at
something under proper tutelage.

310
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,440
I think we'll teach you all of those
things may be,

311
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,170
but there's a lot of people that just
try to get good at it.

312
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,900
They never get good at it.
That probably would do better if they

313
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,570
had better pathways to think.
Yes,

314
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,650
if they learned how to.
Well,

315
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:27,340
I think first what someone like Tony
Robins does because I've listened to a

316
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:31,030
lot of his tapes when I was younger and
what I was all set to make fun of him

317
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,900
because I was trying to write this
parody on him and then I listened to him

318
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:35,830
and I went,
oh,

319
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:38,470
this motherfucker knows exactly how my
brain works.

320
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,000
I mean a lot of ways he simplifies and
he has tools that helped.

321
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:47,500
Helped me
focus my energy and recognize,

322
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,010
recognize certain patterns you recognize
certain unhelpful,

323
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:51,190
bad.

324
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,900
It's very important.
Is having pathways in your mind like

325
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,960
abandoning negative thoughts,
concentrating on positive ones,

326
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,240
abandoning nonsense,
concentrating.

327
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,920
I mean that's a lot of what traps are
that people fall into like addictive

328
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:09,040
traps,
whether it's gambling or whatever.

329
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,980
Fill in the blank pornography.
Like I was watching this whole thing of

330
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:15,280
the day where people were coming out
against pornography and pornography

331
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:18,610
addiction like,
and they were talking about how harmful

332
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,050
pornography's no,
no,

333
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:23,710
your fucking mind is harmful.
Pornography's people having sex and sex

334
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,850
is awesome.
So shut up.

335
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,450
There's a great,
there's a dean to that.

336
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,440
Well you can simplify it this way.
There's a dean who said,

337
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,650
I am not interested.
It's,

338
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,600
it's less important what you think.
What I want to know is how you think and

339
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,820
you're talking about methodology.
It's,

340
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,650
it's how it's exactly what you're
saying.

341
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,950
It's how you think about life and how
you think about things.

342
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,040
So you may be a slave to certain
pathways and learning how to reprogram

343
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,410
you are your pathways is a way,
way more important thing.

344
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,350
So it's not so much that it's
pornography that's the enemy.

345
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,310
Yes,
it's,

346
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,830
it's the methodology.
Pornography is just sex.

347
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,750
And by the way,
we're just talking about regular

348
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,940
pornography there.
There's certain pornography that you go,

349
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,470
okay,
what the fuck is that for?

350
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,050
Like,
why does anybody need to see people spit

351
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,660
in people's eyes and come and people's
noses and stuff?

352
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,820
Like there's a lot of really fucked up
pornography,

353
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:19,000
but I always equate that to like the
same thing was like if you watch a

354
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:23,050
certain violent movies,
it's almost like they are the product of

355
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:26,260
the ramping up effect.
Three other violent movie that's come

356
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:29,020
before them.
They've had to go further and further

357
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,660
and further to the point where it's just
totally ridiculous.

358
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,610
That's exactly right.
It's not entertaining.

359
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:35,050
It's not good.
It's just there.

360
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,230
It's a response to like taking it to the
next level.

361
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,260
The guy who wrote the double helix,
quote unquote for the,

362
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,660
for a serial killer,
for the making of a serial killer,

363
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,150
a guy named Richard Walter who's an FBI
profiler,

364
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,010
brilliant guy.
He said that,

365
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,840
um,
serial killers,

366
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,430
we'll typically,
and this is from literally interviewing

367
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:54,980
20,000,
30,000 prisoners,

368
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,660
uh,
many of whom were murderers,

369
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,290
violent criminals,
and he put together this profile,

370
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:05,291
which was that serial killers.
Many times start as with fetishes.

371
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,590
They'll start with,
you know,

372
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,070
well a lot of times it can be as
innocuous as rubbing against people in

373
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:14,680
public places.
Uh,

374
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
and then what?
And then you,

375
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,380
you graduate,
then that doesn't do it for you anymore.

376
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,150
And then you have to go into a store and
cut leather jackets with a razor because

377
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,000
you might get caught.

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,150
But it's like skin,
all that stuff.

379
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,270
And S and what he said was that you
never,

380
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:32,780
once you get to one level,
you never can go back.

381
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,030
You have to go forward.
You don't see them go,

382
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,530
all right,
this is too much.

383
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,040
Let me go back to rubbing against people
on will never,

384
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,550
I mean,
don't,

385
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,460
don't some people like,
is there people that are potential

386
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:44,690
serial killers?
They go,

387
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:46,340
what the fuck am I doing in my life?
I needed,

388
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,170
I don't know,
Take Yoga.

389
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,180
I don't know.
I don't know.

390
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:52,370
But I do know that there've been some
studies about how,

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,470
uh,
less there are,

392
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:59,210
I guess a lot of serial killers are
maniacs are doing less of that stuff

393
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:02,270
because they can,
they can get more of it to a simulated

394
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,200
environment.
Well,

395
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:07,250
that was the argument that the Japanese
had or some Japanese scholars had about

396
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:11,750
pornography is a Japanese porn is,
is my might be wrong about this.

397
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,820
That it's more embraced and that when
you look at like deviant behavior,

398
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,430
it's more embraced and films and things
like that.

399
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:22,130
And that sort of keeps him from doing it
in real life.

400
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,530
Yeah.
I would imagine that you can get

401
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,030
satiated visually.
You have those,

402
00:16:26,031 --> 00:16:28,940
those visual triggers,
they say that the triggers for fighting,

403
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,770
you know,
when you watch mma,

404
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:34,430
there are a lot of those visual triggers
for men that are similar to what

405
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,880
pornography does to a man.
When we see two dudes kicking each other

406
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:39,650
and knocking each other out,
we want to do it.

407
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,690
Yeah.
Or at least we can't take our eyes off

408
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:41,991
it.
Yeah.

409
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,640
We definitely can't take your eyes off
of it.

410
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,120
Um,
but I think that also it's possible that

411
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,950
that could work.
If they say that about video games,

412
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,590
like the argument against video games,
it's always been the video games

413
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:53,810
encourage violence,
but it shows the,

414
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,140
the actual facts show that's the
opposite is true.

415
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,400
That video games actually get people
involved in the violence of video games

416
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:05,240
and it satisfies whatever weird cravings
people might have for violence,

417
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,950
which are,
you know,

418
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,010
leftover from thousands and thousands of
years of DNA of people being successful

419
00:17:12,171 --> 00:17:14,180
in violence,
being rewarded for it.

420
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,400
You violence was a way you survived.
You know,

421
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,500
think about hunting while the coliseum,
man,

422
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:21,560
I went to the coliseum this week been,
oh my God,

423
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,450
that is a fucking trip.
First of all,

424
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:28,160
I did not know that the coliseum
literally means next to the Colossus.

425
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,640
I didn't know that it was all about,
there was a gigantic,

426
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:36,641
I think it was 150 foot high bronze
statue of Nero that he had constructed.

427
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,791
Well,
you know,

428
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,840
the entire colosseum was Niro's house at
one point in time.

429
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,090
It didn't exist.
It was like,

430
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:48,560
there's like seven areas of Rome,
like seven hills of Rome or something

431
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:50,040
like that.
And His

432
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,740
fucking house was three of them.
Damn.

433
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,630
His house had an enormous,
I think it was like more than a hundred

434
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,590
acre lake in the backyard of his house.
A man made lake.

435
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,680
Wow.
And that manmade lake like to drain it,

436
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,010
the drainage system to build that lake
there.

437
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,110
They,
they're just discovering some of the

438
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:14,610
areas of the coliseum today.
So what they did is when they tore down

439
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:17,730
his house,
they built the coliseum for the people.

440
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,520
And it was like one of the biggest
public buildings ever.

441
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,590
And they built it to satisfy the people
that were just fucking furious that this

442
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:26,660
cunt,
yeah.

443
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,620
Taken over,
burned Rome.

444
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,160
He was just insane.
I mean,

445
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,470
Nero was just fucking completely insane.
But what they had done with his,

446
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,860
his structure was turned it into this
call scene,

447
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,890
but it was right next to this enormous
statue of him.

448
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,640
So when you say like the La Coliseum,
that's a stupid name,

449
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:44,970
right?

450
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,670
Because the La next to the call next
colossus,

451
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,910
that does not make any sense.
But that's what coliseum means.

452
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:52,170
Right?
It's wild.

453
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:53,970
When you go to Italy and especially
Rome,

454
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,320
and you're standing and structures that
have been there for an,

455
00:18:58,321 --> 00:19:02,160
and we're living and had people died on
that.

456
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,110
It's kind of like the idea,
the original octagon,

457
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:04,600
you know?
Well,

458
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,120
way more fucked up than me.
Yeah.

459
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,370
Here's one of the things they found out
just recently,

460
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:11,550
like really recently that they had boat
fights.

461
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,630
They would fill the bottom of the
coliseum with water.

462
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,340
Wow.
And they would have boats,

463
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,250
Jesus and they would get them.
They've literally just discovered this.

464
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,760
They discovered some sort of a,
um,

465
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,610
some sort of artwork or something,
some writing that indicated that these

466
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:31,290
boat fights took place for a very short
amount of time,

467
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,330
like a couple of years.
He do that fight each other with your

468
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:33,840
oars.

469
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,420
They bowels,
they would have battles.

470
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,254
Here it is.
They,

471
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,840
this,
they would fill up powerful Jamie.

472
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,650
They would fill up the bottom with two
meters of water,

473
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,790
six feet of water and have these boats
and float these boats around and they

474
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,880
would fight to the death on boats.
How the fuck would they do that?

475
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:54,150
I guess the walls kept the water,
I guess they'd say drain it.

476
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,610
Well they had a very complex drainage
system.

477
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:58,260
Like they showed the draining system to
us,

478
00:19:58,261 --> 00:19:59,850
wouldn't new they take you on a tour,
you know,

479
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
and uh,
they were showing us the drainage system

480
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:07,641
and also the system of raising the wild
animals from the basement up through the

481
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:09,580
floor.
Yeah.

482
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,270
How would they do that?
They had this thing where these,

483
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:14,180
uh,
they had a reenactment or,

484
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,210
or recreation of one that a,
I took some photos of,

485
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,840
I put one of the photos on my instagram
and these wild animals would be a locked

486
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:23,220
in these rooms,
right.

487
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,620
The small rooms,
they would give them no food,

488
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,260
no water,
and they'd keep them there for days.

489
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,040
So they'd be freaking out and starving.
And then finally they'd take them out of

490
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,350
the dark.
They put them,

491
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,940
uh,
they forced them into this platform.

492
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,240
And then they would have these slaves
crank this mechanism that would lift the

493
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,240
platform up through a trap door in the
floor.

494
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,930
So their first light in days,
and they would be out there with these

495
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:53,920
gladiators and a little and the bottom
floor,

496
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,730
like they had several levels.
And the bottom level was all the rich

497
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:00,910
people,
but they fucked up and they didn't have

498
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:05,260
the walls high enough.
So the lions with leap 12 feet over the

499
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,410
wall and just Jack,
all these rich people,

500
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,910
she's just fine.
She's

501
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,370
now the wall thing and though I,
Yay.

502
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,280
Yeah.
So it's something that San Francisco

503
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:18,190
soon,
that tiger jumped that 12 foot wall.

504
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,150
Exactly.
Yeah.

505
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,250
Well they had to figure out how to do it
too,

506
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,340
because they would get these animals in
there and most of the time they'd let

507
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,600
the animals out and that animals would
be just fucking scared.

508
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,640
They didn't want to fight.
Yeah.

509
00:21:27,641 --> 00:21:30,040
So they,
they realized that by keeping them down

510
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,910
there with no food and no water and
getting them to a complete state of

511
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,410
desperation and hysteria,
that would allow them to ensure that

512
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:41,380
when they pop that trap door,
the lions would come out and just try to

513
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:42,560
jack people.
Brutal.

514
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,600
Yeah.
They would kill everything.

515
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,030
They had elephants,
they had all,

516
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,310
all sorts of crazy fucking animals they
had brought in from Africa,

517
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,920
which by the way is not even a thousand
miles away.

518
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,740
I had no idea.
Africa was so close to the ceiling.

519
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,940
You can see it.
You can,

520
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:55,630
you know what I think?

521
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,463
Well,
you can see,

522
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,040
you can see Africa from Sicily.
I believe.

523
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:04,390
You can see Africa from there.
You can see it.

524
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah.
Like I'm clear days.

525
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,420
Wow.
That's crazy.

526
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,453
Correct.
Doesn't mean wrong.

527
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,600
It seems like too many miles.
No.

528
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,090
There are certain parts of,
let me look at a map.

529
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,610
I can't remember what it seems like.
What?

530
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:19,000
Just one area you can see from Spain.
From the tempest main maybe.

531
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,850
Hmm.
I think I can't eat either way,

532
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,000
but kind of crazy.
That was in Spain and says,

533
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:27,190
you can't get there.
You see the mountains or something?

534
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,263
Yeah.
Wow.

535
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,920
That's crazy.
So crazy.

536
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:30,940
Is that that?
That's that class.

537
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,600
It is.
Yeah.

538
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,230
Look close to this.
Wow.

539
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,520
It's really close.
Yeah.

540
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,570
Seriously.
It's not attached,

541
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:39,550
but I don't know why that happened.
Why didn't have it attach?

542
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,070
It's really weird.
That's a shitty map.

543
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,093
Yeah.

544
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,040
Oh,
what?

545
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,630
Yeah,
that's Africa.

546
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,250
Yeah.
You can see that close.

547
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,740
No wonder the Moore's concord system.
Exactly.

548
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,900
They're right there.
Exactly like they traveled.

549
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,930
No,
they got in a fucking raph floated over.

550
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,660
They backstroke turn out the way.
I mean Jack Jacked everybody,

551
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,810
but uh,
it's fucking beautiful.

552
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,250
It's so beautiful,
man.

553
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,290
Oh yeah.
God Damn often coast.

554
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,880
That's where we went.
We went there too.

555
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,730
We did a,
the Mafia coast with the Vatican,

556
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,560
the Vatican's and saying,
did you do the Vatican I did is insane.

557
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,510
And most of all the seven wonders,
man,

558
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:21,010
the fact that you're walking around on
this fucking tile that's 1700 years old,

559
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,850
it's incredible.
And in all hearts Zayic yeah.

560
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,020
And I mean beautiful artwork that
everybody's walking on.

561
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,300
Yeah.
Like the guy was explaining to us,

562
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,120
they'll like,
this is a 17 year,

563
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,870
a hundred year old work of art.
Not only that,

564
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,350
it was moved from somewhere else and
reconstructed hundreds of years ago

565
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,660
inside the Vatican wasn't even
originally there.

566
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,720
Damn.
I,

567
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,070
I never ever,
I've been to Saint Peter's Cathedral,

568
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,160
I dunno,
maybe

569
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,220
10 times because my uncle used to live
there and he had a rent controlled

570
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,890
apartment over the peanuts in Nevada,
which is really the uncle used to live

571
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:52,780
in Rome.
Yes.

572
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,950
My uncle,
my uncle was,

573
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,491
uh,
in,

574
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:57,110
in Brooklyn,
New York,

575
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,700
in Bensonhurst,
New York.

576
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,880
My uncle was a gay man.
Uh,

577
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,470
well he was very handsome.
He was a diver and a,

578
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:08,060
yeah.
And he was a,

579
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,990
but of course he was an actor and a
singer and a dancer.

580
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,680
And of course in Benson,
hers,

581
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,380
you know,
in Bensonhurst,

582
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:17,220
Brooklyn in the,
I dunno,

583
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,020
let's call it the what,
uh,

584
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,510
50s,
30s,

585
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,670
forties.
When you were gay,

586
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,840
you know,
it wasn't,

587
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,310
first of all,
you were very Catholic.

588
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,470
So that was already a sin.
Second of all,

589
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,700
you weren't really that welcome.
There wasn't a whole lot of gay pride.

590
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,200
Everybody wanted March.
Uh,

591
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:34,310
so he went to Italy.

592
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,850
We went to Rome and lived there,
knew he could be accepted.

593
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,560
Well,
he found his little niche.

594
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,090
He got into the theater company there
and I spoke Italian of course,

595
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:49,091
and a head of Horus and lived for,
and he died at 96 and lived above the

596
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,690
Piazza Navona in a rent controlled
penthouses die from that.

597
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,130
The Vatican own.
He didn't die.

598
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,030
No,
sir.

599
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,730
I'm going to ask you to be a little more
mature.

600
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,390
We have a lot of people listening.
He did not die from dicks.

601
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,380
Uh,
but he was a,

602
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,050
he was a character man and he did lots
of plays.

603
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,530
And did you know that the Vatican owns
the building that houses Europe's

604
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:12,800
largest gay gathpath house?
I did not know that.

605
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,880
But I also don't believe you because
the,

606
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,160
is that a,
is that a matter of,

607
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,340
uh,
is that a matter of a conjecture or it's

608
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:19,730
fact.

609
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,150
It's probably a bath house now.
It's the largest gay bath house in

610
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:25,340
Europe and the Vatican owns it.
Not only that,

611
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,500
I see,
I see the,

612
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,350
there's the cardinals or the bishops
who's fucking office is right above the

613
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:31,730
gay bath house.
Conveniently,

614
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,280
conveniently,
there's a fucking shoot that just

615
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,970
dropped down a lot of property as lube
up their button,

616
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:40,640
drop down through the floor and look at
this Vatican please.

617
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:42,730
Landlord to Europe's biggest gay
bathhouse.

618
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,260
Catholic church paid $30 million to
acquire a building that houses a senior.

619
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:50,180
Will cardinal end a huge gay sauna?
Nothing.

620
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,910
How weird.
It's so weird that,

621
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:53,810
uh,
I mean,

622
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,430
I don't know why they would want to own
that.

623
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:00,460
I don't know cause you want to sweat
while you get your Dick Dick work by

624
00:26:00,621 --> 00:26:03,980
strong man hands.
That's all.

625
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,070
Well the amount of artwork that is in
the Vatican,

626
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:10,460
like if you haven't been there before,
like I was not that excited about going

627
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:11,720
to the Vatican before went there.

628
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,610
It was like,
well I want to see the coliseum.

629
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:18,470
Obviously it's like one of the great
wonders of history like that they had

630
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:22,520
this thing there and that they did this
and then it's also like the ultimate

631
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:24,410
sign of excess.
You know,

632
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,840
like the,
the one thing that people point to when

633
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:29,870
they talk about society's falling apart
due to excess as the Romans,

634
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:31,190
the Romans,
they went crazy.

635
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:35,270
Like it was also sort of what gave food
to the reformation.

636
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,750
When Martin Luther,
this German Jesuit priest said,

637
00:26:38,751 --> 00:26:41,690
hey man,
all this money that's going to,

638
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,520
you know,
idolatry essentially like building

639
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,420
these incredible statues and these
incredible cathedrals and we're starving

640
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,700
over here.
How about if we just read the Bible,

641
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,520
we just read the Bible.
Then maybe we'll be,

642
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,420
you know,
just is in favor with God as you guys.

643
00:26:57,421 --> 00:27:01,920
And maybe we don't need a hierarchy of
bishops and all these and popes and all

644
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:06,921
this sort of rank and file that also
needs a salary that's also taking money.

645
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,690
Well,
Martin Luther was also the first guy to

646
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:13,680
translate the Bible phonetically so that
regular people could read it because

647
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,990
everybody else was like,
no one knew Latin.

648
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,760
They couldn't read Latin.
That's right.

649
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,990
So it was only these priests that we had
to rely on to,

650
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,700
to get the word of God from Martin
Luther was like,

651
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,090
that's ridiculous.
But as luckily Martin Luther,

652
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,670
it had such a high standing in society,
they couldn't kill him.

653
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,600
Right.
They tried.

654
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:31,230
He had to leave.

655
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,580
He was always on the run.
But you're right.

656
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,680
But it was,
if he was anyone else,

657
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,980
if he wasn't like a very respected high
standing person in society,

658
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:39,600
they probably would have jacked him a
long time ago.

659
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,270
Yeah.
That there was already,

660
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,010
um,
from an eye,

661
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,060
I can't remember.
I read a lot about it back in the day,

662
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:47,790
but um,
he was always under threat of that.

663
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,890
He had to essentially,
I think it was in bitten Berg.

664
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:53,640
And there's this a phrase that people
always associate with Rome called the

665
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:58,410
vomitorium and uh,
that's not what it sounds like.

666
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,770
Everybody thinks that they got there and
they threw up and then they went back

667
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:03,840
and eight again.
That's not what they did.

668
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,240
I always thought they did that.
Yeah.

669
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:08,430
No,
the vomitorium refers to the way they

670
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,750
got people out of the stadium had
nothing to do with the word vomit.

671
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,360
Huh?
It's the way the stadium is structured.

672
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,540
Is this gigantic?
That's a vomitorium is the,

673
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,770
the,
the exit.

674
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,640
So they had all these exits.
They had a bunch of different doors all

675
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:27,510
throughout the building.
Like if you look at like some images of

676
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:30,180
the colosseum,
there's all these pathways.

677
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:31,260
Like you would go,
you know,

678
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,060
30 yards over,
there's another pathway,

679
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:34,530
30 hours over,
there's another pathway.

680
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,060
And that allowed an efficient way of
getting people see like look at all the

681
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:41,430
doorways,
see all those doorways all around it.

682
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:45,330
That that was an efficient method of
getting people out of the stadium.

683
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,160
So they called it a vomitorium.
But like if you look the etymology of

684
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:51,780
the word,
like look up the,

685
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,710
the origins of the word vomitorium and
what it means in Latin,

686
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:58,710
but it doesn't have anything to do with
vomit but sounds like it.

687
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,620
So everybody was like,
ah,

688
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:01,320
they,
they just fucking eight and threw up.

689
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,860
So people like sort of repeated that
over and over and over again.

690
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:06,720
Let's stick a feather down their throat.
I'm sure someone did that.

691
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,110
I'm sure there was some fat.
Fuck,

692
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,790
that's right now in Los Angeles.
Yeah.

693
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,300
Fuck yeah.
I just did.

694
00:29:12,301 --> 00:29:15,900
A girl had a problem with that.
So deny vomitorium.

695
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,690
Okay.
Here it was a place which according to

696
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:21,120
popular misconception,
the ancient Romans were supposed to

697
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:22,410
vomit it.
That's not true.

698
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,020
Um,
the arch of a series of entrances or

699
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:28,980
exit pathways and an ancient Roman
amphitheater or theater.

700
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:29,671
Yeah.
See,

701
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:33,120
that's what it really means.
So the popular misconception,

702
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,900
the second version of it,
but translate user over time.

703
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
What,
what is the origins of the word though?

704
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,990
Like what does that mean?
Vomitorium is the plural noun.

705
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,160
Huh?
That's weird.

706
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,520
That's the plural vomitorium probably,
you know,

707
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,120
it sounds like it's where people would
vomit out of,

708
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,320
right?

709
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,860
Yeah,
but it's not vomit.

710
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,560
That's not,
it's like that's our word.

711
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,230
Yeah,
but that's not like what they would call

712
00:29:59,231 --> 00:29:59,950
it.
Right?

713
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,850
Like you know what I'm saying?
Like our word vomit is puke,

714
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,060
but that's not what they were referring
to when they were calling it a

715
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,220
vomitorium.
It's just one of those weird Latin

716
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,440
things.
But everybody always thinks that

717
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,110
everybody thinks that that's what a
vomitorium was like.

718
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,720
You should imagine if there was a
fucking house that people would go to

719
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:18,070
throw up and like,
hey,

720
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:20,560
let's keep going to go to the vomitorium
fucking puke.

721
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:23,440
Like what kind of assholes eat?
Here's a feather.

722
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:27,190
But you would call it the puke house.
Like that is so ridiculous.

723
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,280
The puke room,
vomitorium puke room.

724
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,860
The sauna room.
What is the actual,

725
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,730
does it say Jamie?
It says here this tube misinterpret or

726
00:30:36,731 --> 00:30:38,730
where it might have came from the
misinterpretations.

727
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,210
Yeah,
but what is the original?

728
00:30:40,211 --> 00:30:43,390
Was the actual word mean?
Like vomitorium.

729
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,310
It just sounds like this is the
entrance.

730
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,280
Just fourth.
Oh,

731
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:55,060
to spew forth this beautiful earth and a
wonder if involvement actually came from

732
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,350
that then.
Yeah,

733
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,320
so the original thing was an exit and
then vomit became that.

734
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,970
Ah,
that's interesting.

735
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,440
It's kind of how language happens,
right?

736
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,303
Yeah,
but that's,

737
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,410
well,
it's weird how it happens over thousands

738
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:10,150
of years.
So things just stuart and warp.

739
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,800
Yeah.
That's how the language is always

740
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,690
changing.
It's always changing.

741
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,340
We're always making up our own
languages.

742
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,770
It's constant.
While we were there,

743
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,600
they had just found some new shit two
days before we were there.

744
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:28,170
They're constantly finding new path and
passages underneath the coliseum and new

745
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:31,930
things,
but the amount of work that was done in

746
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:35,200
completing that building and making
those structures,

747
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:38,830
it's insane with free labor,
which is why slavery isn't that bad.

748
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,570
Oh,
what?

749
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,900
Wait a minute.
It's interesting that slavery was the

750
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:48,901
order of the day for most of history,
but when you look at like wage slavery

751
00:31:50,501 --> 00:31:53,710
today,
when you mean there's no slavery today,

752
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,430
but if you can imprison people in a
state of poverty,

753
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,330
right.
And it's not,

754
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,480
not against their will voluntarily.
Right.

755
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:05,710
You get people hooked on buying things
and you get them hooked on credit.

756
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:09,430
So they need to work,
they constantly need to work and then

757
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,330
they're in these jobs that are
completely dead end low wage jobs.

758
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,570
They can't go anywhere and then they
perform these menial tasks.

759
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,320
And until we figure out robot that could
do those tasks far better and far more

760
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:24,070
efficient.
It's not slavery because they can quit

761
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:29,071
and leave anytime they want.
But in a lot of ways it has the same

762
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:31,600
effect.
There's a difference.

763
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,250
I think there's a lot of differences.
I mean I'm talking about there's a macro

764
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:38,740
difference.
Like there's there

765
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,250
an idea that has gained great traction
and cause ideas move really slowly

766
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:49,430
sometimes.
But there's an idea that has gained

767
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,300
traction in most of the world and even
in parts of the world where it isn't,

768
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,310
they try to defend it as it being so,
and that is the idea of universal human

769
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:02,210
rights.
Universal human rights was not an idea

770
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,020
that was embraced by most of the world.
Even as far back properly.

771
00:33:06,021 --> 00:33:10,010
You can make the argument as 1940
slavery was alive and well.

772
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,410
Think about this country and it's and
itself,

773
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,440
this country until 1964 was it a where
there was separate but equal the idea

774
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:21,110
that you had black and white water
fountains,

775
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,780
um,
a brown horse years before that,

776
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:26,060
which is nothing slavery.
That's right.

777
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:29,930
And so the idea that,
and of course that had to be defended

778
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:33,260
along biblical grounds and all these
kind of shotty ideas,

779
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,130
but the idea of,
of universal human rights,

780
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:41,570
even though the Judaeo Christian ethic
and even Islam talked about sort of

781
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:45,200
everybody being of the same moral worth
because we're all from the same father,

782
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:45,440
right?

783
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,060
That's the monotheistic a notion and
where value comes in those religions,

784
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,990
we're all the same as long as you,
you know,

785
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,300
read the Bible and follow these tenants.
But universally human rights is

786
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,890
something a little bit different and
it's a modern concept and um,

787
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,080
that likes a germ theory.
The idea that these things you can't

788
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:05,630
see,
but you still have to wash your hands or

789
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:07,820
you can spread bacteria and things like
that.

790
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,190
Those things that move very slowly.
But that is,

791
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,810
I think where you,
are you connecting those?

792
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,860
I'll just talking about how both those
ideas are ideas.

793
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:17,270
It took a long time to gain traction,
you know,

794
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,860
even though they were good for us and by
law.

795
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,860
But let's stick to,
let's stick to um,

796
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,550
universal human rights.
I think that that idea,

797
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:30,320
I think that idea is,
is just that mindset and the fact that

798
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:35,321
you have to defend it as a society is
why there's such a stark difference

799
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,140
between,
I understand what you're saying by being

800
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:41,450
at bondage to your lifestyle,
to having to make a living because

801
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:43,220
you've got people who depend on you and
stuff like that.

802
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,350
I don't think that'll ever go away.
But,

803
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,980
um,
there's such a,

804
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,480
there is,
I don't think that'll go with,

805
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,070
could definitely go on saying we
slavery,

806
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm optimistic.
But what I'm saying is that there's,

807
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,450
I think when I'm like,
slaves have zero dignity.

808
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,510
Like it in fact there's no somebody one
time as a historian is that there's no

809
00:35:02,511 --> 00:35:05,840
such thing as a slave slave there.
There are people in bondage.

810
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,100
So anybody who is a slave,
you're not a slave,

811
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,530
but you are a person in slavery.
Right.

812
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,790
So,
so it was like he,

813
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,870
he poses the question,
he said,

814
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:16,790
what did the civil rights movement begin
in this country?

815
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,541
And it was like,
well,

816
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:20,120
and sell Alabama and the 60s and the
fifth.

817
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:20,931
No.
I said,

818
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:21,260
no,
no,

819
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,411
no,
no,

820
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,870
no.
He said the civil rights movement began

821
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:28,610
the first day that an African American
was brought to this country against his

822
00:35:28,611 --> 00:35:29,120
will.

823
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,630
Any human being doesn't want to be in
bondage.

824
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,610
You are always trying to get out of
bondage.

825
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,450
And there is that striving for that.
I think we're getting closer to,

826
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:40,650
I think,
well wait a minute,

827
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,540
that's slavery.
How was that,

828
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:45,180
the civil rights movement,
this is the first day that someone's

829
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:47,340
brought to United States against their
will.

830
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,510
That's not the first day that someone
enacted some sort of a civil right.

831
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,770
Well,
he was being,

832
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,810
he was being,
what he was saying was that,

833
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,750
you know,
everybody is always fighting for dignity

834
00:35:57,751 --> 00:36:00,900
and their own serenity and their own
civil rights regardless of,

835
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,940
you know,
where they are.

836
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,750
If you put someone in bondage and you
make them do things against their will

837
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,300
and you,
you take their dignity away,

838
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,610
they are immediately,
they're immediately beginning to

839
00:36:12,611 --> 00:36:14,910
struggle for their own freedom.
Right,

840
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,250
and that's where the conspiracy theories
fall into play,

841
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:22,080
where modern capitalism is thought of as
being some sort of a new way around that

842
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,940
that instead of having people slaves,
like literally bonding them,

843
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,740
putting them in chains,
keeping them against their will.

844
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,690
Instead you just set up these honey
traps and you allow people to get sucked

845
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:38,691
into these things like having massive
debt from student loans and making

846
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:43,020
credit cards easy and allowing people to
mortgage a house they can't really

847
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:47,340
afford knowing full well that eventually
the bank's going to foreclose on this

848
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:51,060
and reap some sort of a profit and that
all these things,

849
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,010
this is where conspiracy theories fall
into play,

850
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,080
that all these things are set up to
enact a modern form of slavery and that

851
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:02,430
there's always going to be people that
are taking advantage of people below

852
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:06,480
them and putting them in very
disadvantageous situations for their own

853
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:08,820
gain.
I would say that that's literally the

854
00:37:08,821 --> 00:37:09,970
state of nature.
And,

855
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,910
and what I mean by that is that,
let,

856
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:13,530
let,
let's just take for example,

857
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm the marketplace.
Uh,

858
00:37:15,301 --> 00:37:17,310
if you just let people,
you let people go,

859
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,510
let people do their thing.

860
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,030
They are going to,
for example,

861
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,820
uh,
there's going to be a marketplace for

862
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,670
differences of opinion.
This is what I mean,

863
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,450
there's a company,
it's about to start up a,

864
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,250
you start a company,
I don't know what it is.

865
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,110
Let's just say it's a,
you know,

866
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,350
a tech gadget.
And you're going to have groups of

867
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:39,210
people on this side that are going to
say,

868
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:42,810
that's going to be the next big thing.
Joe Rogan's company's going to be the

869
00:37:42,811 --> 00:37:45,360
next apple and you're going to have a
bunch of other people on the other side.

870
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:46,830
We're going to go,
you know what,

871
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,540
uh,
not a shot.

872
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,090
And here's why.
So you have these differences of opinion

873
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,740
and there's a marketplace.
There is a marketplace for what

874
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:57,430
essentially is a derivative,
uh,

875
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:58,380
you know,
or a swap.

876
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:01,410
There's a marketplace there too where
people say,

877
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,550
I will bet you I will short that.
I will basically say,

878
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:10,160
I'll buy it at this price right now and
I'll sell it to,

879
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,690
and if it goes up in value,
you pay me the difference.

880
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,000
That's how,
that's how marketplaces work.

881
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,080
So for me it's capitalism has just a
bunch of people with different opinions

882
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:22,110
who are trying to make money,
who are coming up with ideas.

883
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,450
And if you create a society where you
can enforce contracts and make people

884
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,850
keep their promises and you can,
you can ensure that people have what's

885
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:35,980
called property rights,
which is really important.

886
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,530
You know,
courts essentially that have integrity,

887
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:43,420
that can't be bought off,
then that's as far as I can see what

888
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,910
you'd call a free market capitalist
society.

889
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,400
And it seems to be better than most of
the other sort of,

890
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,290
uh,
systems that require central oversight.

891
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,560
And because I,
not because central oversight is such a

892
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:02,440
bad thing,
I just think it's impossible to control.

893
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,500
You know,
the way people think on such a macro

894
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,030
scale.
I think it's very,

895
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,080
I don't think you have to control the
way people think well or behave or

896
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,750
behave more harder.
Well,

897
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,020
yeah,
I get it.

898
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,960
And I see what you're saying about
capitalism and I see what you're saying

899
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:20,140
about society.
I think that all these things,

900
00:39:20,141 --> 00:39:23,710
when we point to ancient room would
point to how fucked up their world was.

901
00:39:23,711 --> 00:39:26,710
And slavery is recently as a couple
hundred years ago.

902
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,360
I think what we're saying is things are
getting better or we're evolving.

903
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,360
We're figuring out a way to make a
society that is more beneficial to more

904
00:39:36,731 --> 00:39:39,040
people,
but still not to everyone.

905
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,660
And then the point is,
is it possible to create a Utopian

906
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:46,000
society where it's beneficial to
virtually everyone?

907
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,890
And then the way to do that,
the only way to do that is like,

908
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,850
here's a,
here's a good example.

909
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:56,851
Like people love to tout socialism as
some sort of a cure to what ails us.

910
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,040
You know that somehow or another that if
you get people and you,

911
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:07,360
you give everybody money and you,
everybody's shares wealth equally.

912
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,890
But the problem with that cuts out
incentive incentive for madness and

913
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:16,180
excellence and the incentive for madness
and excellence is why you have tesla

914
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:19,210
motorcars and Ilan Musk and all these
fucking jobs.

915
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:22,060
Steve Jobs.
Steve jobs is a fucking maniac.

916
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,310
He was up,
I mean probably a bad dad.

917
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:24,790
Probably.

918
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,830
Probably probably a shitty got to work
for,

919
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,200
you know,
probably a total asshole if you did

920
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:31,900
something wrong.
If you put a one instead of a zero and a

921
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:35,740
line of code and the fucking phone
crashed when it hit a thousand emails or

922
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:37,270
what,
he'd probably beat the fuck out of him.

923
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,720
I mean he's a maniac.
Yeah,

924
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,920
but it was because of him that we have
iphones.

925
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,050
Well it's because of that kind of
madness.

926
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,810
100% how many,
how many iphones have you bought that

927
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,650
were made in Russia?
How many cars have you bought that were

928
00:40:48,651 --> 00:40:49,530
made in rush?
Exactly,

929
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,070
but in Russia's fucked up example,
because it's not really socialism,

930
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,230
it's really communist.
Dictatorship nowadays is,

931
00:40:56,231 --> 00:40:58,310
yeah.
What kind of was and then it wasn't and

932
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,160
it was again,
it never really recovered.

933
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,660
The Russians.
I think that their problem is they have

934
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,180
one idea of power,
which is biggest guns.

935
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,210
Divert your eyes in my presence.
How fucked up is that?

936
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,830
Russia's getting kicked out of the
Olympics.

937
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,170
Yeah,
I pay attention is,

938
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,930
yeah,
of course.

939
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,711
Fuck.
They're going to tick.

940
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:14,270
Kicked the whole team.
The whole Russian team.

941
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,680
What cheating is so it's so systemic,
so systemic.

942
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,930
It's,
it's state sponsored come.

943
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,060
They've got the KGB apparently are that.
Well,

944
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:23,620
it used to be the KGB involved.
Well,

945
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,680
now I have this one woman who was a
whistle blower who's going to compete

946
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:29,800
independently without a nation.
How long before they kill her?

947
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:31,210
I know.
Good luck with that bitch.

948
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:33,120
Get fucking bottle of water.
That's,

949
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,370
that's Russia's problem.

950
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,410
Russia's idea.
There are two types of power,

951
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,270
right?
There's the power that where you can't

952
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,780
stop staring at somebody because they
have prestige and you want to be like

953
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,060
them.
That's a power that you can use for

954
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:45,680
good.
If you have all those eyeballs on you,

955
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,850
you can,
you can say,

956
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:48,470
hey guys,
I know you're all looking at me and you

957
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,000
do this all the time and how many people
love this?

958
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,320
How many people download this podcast?
You're very aware of the responsibility

959
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:55,910
that comes with,
so you do two things.

960
00:41:55,911 --> 00:41:58,670
Do you try to keep it really honest and
true to yourself?

961
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:01,460
But you also try to have really smart
people on who have different

962
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:04,850
perspectives so you can kind of figure
out a way to get those ideas out into

963
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:07,580
people's heads.
That's one form of power that I would

964
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:09,050
consider a positive use.

965
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,240
Then there's the Russian model of power.
Well,

966
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,490
it's not power.
It's influence.

967
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,750
Uh,
I would,

968
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,960
I think they're very closely related.
I think they're joined at the hill.

969
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:19,610
They don't,
it doesn't control anyone.

970
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,890
That's the difference between like the
power that Putin has and the power that

971
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,210
the nerdist so,
so,

972
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:26,661
so,
so.

973
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,040
Exactly.
You just use the word.

974
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:31,310
So there's a difference.
So there's power that controls when

975
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:36,311
there's power that inspires.
And I think power that inspires is what

976
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,530
this country needs to keep in mind at
all times.

977
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,690
That's the power look.
You always need power,

978
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,430
you need guns and stuff.
They're crazy people.

979
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:45,530
You need a strong military.
I think the difference is like is it

980
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:48,920
using a blanket statement like power?
It's like the board drugs,

981
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,750
like caffeine is drug,
so it was meth.

982
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,930
You know what I mean?
Like there's power and then there's

983
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,080
influence,
but there's things that are powerful and

984
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:01,340
then there's things that have power over
people and exactly like to control

985
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,500
people like and then people can't do
anything about it.

986
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:05,000
That's exactly,
that's a difference.

987
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,470
That's right.
So the word power,

988
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,320
the problem is the use of the word
power.

989
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:14,321
I remember also mindset.
I believe that Russia and which is such

990
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:17,000
an amazing,
with such an amazing group of people,

991
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:19,760
they could do anything they wanted and a
strong culture,

992
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,070
but I think the mindset of Russians in
many,

993
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,630
in many ways,
maybe it's not their fault,

994
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:27,770
maybe it's a product of their history.
Their mindset is that they admire the,

995
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,890
the first example of power control and
strength and dominance more than they

996
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:38,750
admire the power that influences and
inspires things that are powerful.

997
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,020
So I like trump supporters.
I think so they're polluting supporters.

998
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,930
They like a strong man at the helm.
We know that trump like Putin and Putin

999
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:48,850
likes trump.
Yes,

1000
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,210
that sec.
Yeah,

1001
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,290
it's probably not good,
right?

1002
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,000
I would imagine.
No,

1003
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,810
I haven't been paying attention to the
Republican national convention,

1004
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:59,450
but shit,
but Jamie did and I,

1005
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,790
but I am paying attention to the fact
that this is,

1006
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:04,370
this is what I like about all this
stuff.

1007
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,590
What I like about all this trump
nonsenses it's shown how vulnerable the

1008
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:13,591
system is to fuckery that a madman and
come along and just take over the whole

1009
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:16,850
thing.
Did you see what his fucking biographer

1010
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,070
said?
That guy,

1011
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,790
he had rosie for Morris,
right?

1012
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,700
Deep remorse.
And he said that if Donald Trump becomes

1013
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,980
president and it has the key to the
nuclear football,

1014
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:27,740
he said he literally could be the end of
civilization.

1015
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,800
He said,
the book should have been titled and

1016
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,680
styled titled instead of the art of the
deal,

1017
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,040
should

1018
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,100
have been titled the art of Sociopath,
I believe.

1019
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:35,781
Or,
or the,

1020
00:44:35,781 --> 00:44:37,830
the words of a sociopath or something
along those lines.

1021
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,740
But his take on trump is that he's a
total sociopath.

1022
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,060
Not Surprising to me.
I mean,

1023
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,810
he's certainly a narcissist and maybe
they're the same thing in some ways,

1024
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:46,410
but I've,
I mean,

1025
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:47,360
my wife though,
he's,

1026
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,770
he's got a hot wife.
He's always bringing things back to

1027
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:54,750
himself and he just,
he just lies at his convenience.

1028
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,950
He's just,
it's unbelievable.

1029
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,330
Do you know that he's been sued?
Something like 3,500 times?

1030
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,400
I believe that when you have a huge
company,

1031
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:03,810
that happens a lot.
So that's,

1032
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:07,110
that's,
that's not as surprising to me.

1033
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:09,160
What my,
by waiters and stuff.

1034
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
Yeah.
Well,

1035
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,370
you know,
his creditors,

1036
00:45:11,371 --> 00:45:12,900
a lot of people that invested,
you know,

1037
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:14,850
people that did work for him never got
paid.

1038
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,320
A lot of the companies that he started a
went bankrupt.

1039
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,660
You know,
we talked about how the university,

1040
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,141
well,
yeah,

1041
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,060
we talk about him being this great
businessman.

1042
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,070
I don't know that we have a lot of
evidence.

1043
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:29,130
He's done a good job creating a brand
that's worth something.

1044
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:32,820
So if you put it on a hotel,
it comes with in your mind,

1045
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,840
uh,
you think of high quality prestige plus,

1046
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,470
you know,
nice bedding and the,

1047
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:37,930
you know,
the,

1048
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,530
or if he has a building,
it's the trump tower.

1049
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Also interesting that he took the name
trump because like I believe trump card,

1050
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:51,231
that expression trump card was there
before the name trump because his last

1051
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:52,880
name is drunk.
Yeah,

1052
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,560
drunk.
That's his actual last name that I saw.

1053
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:56,790
John all ever her.
Talk about that.

1054
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:58,200
It's real nice.
I mean there's nothing wrong with that

1055
00:45:58,201 --> 00:45:59,280
named [inaudible].
I mean,

1056
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:01,560
shit,
Arnold Schwarzenegger became famous as

1057
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:02,730
Arnold Swartz,
a nigger.

1058
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,080
I mean,
he's got the goofy,

1059
00:46:04,081 --> 00:46:07,020
his fucking name ever and he smashed it
with that name in America.

1060
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,790
You can get away with it.
Why couldn't you be drunk?

1061
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,090
I did the wrong with drum.
I remember it doesn't mean anything.

1062
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:17,120
I remember being amazed that the United
States voted a man by the name of Barack

1063
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:20,490
Hussein Obama.
And when we are public enemy number one

1064
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:21,750
was uh,
you know,

1065
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,540
uh,
Osama bin Ladin so phonetically they

1066
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:25,830
sound very similar.
Oh yeah.

1067
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:29,170
Well how about who's sane when we were
also Emma enemies with [inaudible]

1068
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:30,840
saying exact crazy.
Yeah.

1069
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,020
I mean he had a goofy ass fucking name
for a guy to be elected president,

1070
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:35,640
but that's why I give Americans a lot of
credit.

1071
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,320
I think Americans are,
are,

1072
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,180
you know,
if you listened to European stock,

1073
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:41,730
but they're always marveling at how
quote unquote dumb Americans are.

1074
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,380
I don't think Americans are dumb.
And I think Americans and a lot of ways

1075
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:46,200
they're very fair minded too.
Well,

1076
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,450
there's that,
but there's also the fact that there's a

1077
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,790
two party system where if you are on the
left,

1078
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:52,500
you have to support whoever's on the
left.

1079
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,850
That's why all these people lining up to
support Hillary Clinton and ignoring

1080
00:46:56,851 --> 00:47:00,000
left and right.
All the crazy evidence against her just

1081
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:02,250
being completely full of shit.
She's corrupt.

1082
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,390
We,
oh my God.

1083
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:06,180
We played this video the other day where
they were showing the differences

1084
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:09,480
between with the FBI has said about her
trial,

1085
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:13,710
about them looking into the email
server,

1086
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:18,660
the illegal use of email server.
The fact that top secret documents were

1087
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:23,661
shared cut and pasted and shared with
people that did not have the status to

1088
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,900
be able to check those and that multiple
devices were used to access these and

1089
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,160
then compare them to what she has

1090
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,260
said about it.
She's just a liar.

1091
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,030
She's a liar.
He's a liar.

1092
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:35,000
She's a liar.
You,

1093
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,570
what do you think?
Why do you think she set that server up

1094
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:39,670
in our bathroom?
What was the benefit of that do you

1095
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:41,740
think?
Who the fuck knows?

1096
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,500
What's it?
Just convenience and what she told to do

1097
00:47:44,501 --> 00:47:45,790
that.
It could be that.

1098
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:49,810
It could be that she just didn't want
anybody to have any oversight over her

1099
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:52,150
email and she wanted to have a server in
her home.

1100
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,670
Look,
she deleted a lot of fucking emails,

1101
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,360
thousands of emails,
and you're not supposed to do that.

1102
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,870
Like that's a part of that Gig.
Part of that Gig is transparency.

1103
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,670
She skirted around that kid.
I had Mike Baker in here from the CIA,

1104
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:10,510
a former CIA operative who said flat out
if he had done the same thing,

1105
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,210
he was how he says what he says,
yes,

1106
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,510
I would be in jail now he'd be in jail.

1107
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,350
And he was discussing how this is just
not done and everyone knows this.

1108
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:19,300
This is like,
it's not a woman who just stepped into

1109
00:48:19,301 --> 00:48:21,670
politics for the first time.
This is someone who's been involved in

1110
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:25,270
politics virtually your whole life.
I read a good article.

1111
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,870
Somebody sent me and I'll send it to
you.

1112
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,360
Um,
I can't remember what the magazine was

1113
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:30,340
credible,
a credible magazine and the journalist,

1114
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,721
he said,
look,

1115
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:33,760
I have my point of view on Hillary and
he's not,

1116
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,800
I left leaning,
I think he's probably more of a

1117
00:48:35,801 --> 00:48:36,970
conservative columnists.
And he said,

1118
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,350
and he went and um,
he interviewed all the people that have

1119
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,870
worked with Hillary Clinton for,
with,

1120
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,711
and,
uh,

1121
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:48,010
and even her opponents.
And it was really,

1122
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,290
really,
really interesting to get the

1123
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,220
perspective.
He said,

1124
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,130
the one thing that they talk about is
number one,

1125
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,620
she doesn't feel very comfortable in
front of,

1126
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,400
it's not a natural fit for her to be in
front of audiences talking.

1127
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:02,020
But Dude,
she's such a great speaker.

1128
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:02,854
She's a great speaker.

1129
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,480
I think her voice is very grounded and
strong like this.

1130
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,110
It's boxy,
but they all bought it.

1131
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:15,700
They didn't use words like they consider
it to be funny,

1132
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,700
thoughtful,
and very intelligent.

1133
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,780
Now,
uh,

1134
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,550
that,
that was an interesting eye.

1135
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,870
My eyes were a little bit over and I
said,

1136
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:24,220
well,
the people that are close to it,

1137
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:28,150
I've worked with her,
had more favorable things to say,

1138
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:30,790
and I'm not a hillary supporter,
but they had more favorable than

1139
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:32,650
negative,
which I thought was pretty interesting

1140
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:34,990
because I'd never thought of actually
interviewing people that have worked

1141
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:36,040
closely with her.
Okay.

1142
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,920
Stop right there.
These are political people.

1143
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,560
True.
So think about what their job is,

1144
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,300
right?
What they do for a living and how to

1145
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:46,300
make it in that world.
You have to be full of Shit and you have

1146
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,220
to like,
yeah,

1147
00:49:47,221 --> 00:49:49,930
it's very much like somebody say
something bad about somebody else cause

1148
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:51,470
you never know if they're going to be
it.

1149
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,010
It's amazing.
It's the best of the best gift I've ever

1150
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:54,341
read.
Well,

1151
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:56,290
not only that,
he's an amazing actor.

1152
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,790
She's amazing.
Oh my God.

1153
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:00,010
Ghostbusters.
The new ghostbusters is incredible.

1154
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,040
Those girls are so strong.
They're such strong women.

1155
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,390
It's my new thing.
It's amazing.

1156
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,160
My new thing is the empowerment of
women.

1157
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,130
I love this new talk that it's just,
it's not new either.

1158
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,690
I'm just,
she's totally empowered.

1159
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:12,820
She's,
she's totally embraced her new hoodie.

1160
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,980
Oh God.
She's bending over,

1161
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,560
arching her back and licking her lips.
She saw power.

1162
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:21,130
She's brave because she's naked and fat.
She's so brave.

1163
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,120
All right.
If she was brave,

1164
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:27,440
she'd get up at four o'clock in the
morning and hit the gym before she went

1165
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,130
to the set.
She wouldn't

1166
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,040
be fat anymore.
I'll tell her what's period that Melissa

1167
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,260
McCarthy woman,
they're angry that she's losing weight

1168
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,850
to understand this.
I love it.

1169
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,460
They're angry that she's choosing to
become healthy.

1170
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,210
So they're saying this is in direct
contrast to who she was before,

1171
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,050
who we loved is this fucking cartoonish
fat lady and this cartoonish fat laid

1172
00:50:46,051 --> 00:50:47,970
who we want to pretend is healthy.
Yeah.

1173
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,060
You know,
there's a fucking slew of people out

1174
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:54,830
there that have blogs out there talking
about different things that are healthy

1175
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:58,040
about being fat.
And I went down a rabbit hole one night

1176
00:50:58,041 --> 00:51:00,620
because some woman was writing shoes,
this obese woman.

1177
00:51:00,621 --> 00:51:03,110
And I was really sad when I was looking
at her photos.

1178
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:05,990
And you know,
people like to highlight things that

1179
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:08,570
people say about them on social media
and you know,

1180
00:51:08,571 --> 00:51:09,021
like,
you know,

1181
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:11,090
all these people are harassing her for
being fat,

1182
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:12,920
but she putting out a blog,
right?

1183
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,170
When you putting yourself out there and
you putting a blog,

1184
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,180
you're just going to a tree.
You put some honey out there,

1185
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:18,420
you're gonna attract a certain amount of
bugs.

1186
00:51:18,421 --> 00:51:19,910
It's just no way around that.
Right?

1187
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:25,180
But she was talking about different
aspects of being overweight that are

1188
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:30,500
healthy.
And that is one weird phenomenon where

1189
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,560
healthy people that catch a disease
sometimes don't do as well as fat people

1190
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:40,280
that have the same disease.
In the old days they said you should

1191
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:43,310
have some weight on you in case you get
a disease and you can fight it better.

1192
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:44,900
That was always the case.
What does that,

1193
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,670
how,
how could that be true?

1194
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,100
I guess because maybe,
and I'm just,

1195
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:53,000
this is bro Science,
but from what I remember reading your

1196
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:57,320
fat can actually absorb or store,
uh,

1197
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,280
uh,
more.

1198
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,300
I,
I don't know where you have,

1199
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,330
you have reserves when you're not eating
and stuff at you,

1200
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,400
you know,
your body will use the fatty acids for

1201
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:05,960
energy was that makes sense.

1202
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,650
So your body gets into a state of
burning fat rather than burning food.

1203
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,040
And many times when people are sick,
that's a huge issue.

1204
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,060
Coming up with some form of energy.
My Italian relatives,

1205
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:19,520
you know,
th the Sicilian side back in the day,

1206
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:21,950
I remember if somebody was too skinny,
they look,

1207
00:52:21,951 --> 00:52:23,450
they,
they would say,

1208
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,680
you know,
be careful.

1209
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,820
You get sick,
you know,

1210
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,340
you'll die.
Or was it totally makes sense,

1211
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:30,230
but that doesn't mean it's healthy to be
fat,

1212
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,560
but it just means it's like a,
it's a reserve policy in case you get a

1213
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:37,520
fucking catastrophic disease,
but you also more likely to get that

1214
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,590
catastrophic disease if you're fat.
Yeah.

1215
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,250
So she's such a catch 22,
this book by Gary Taubes,

1216
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,950
I just love called why we get fat and
what to do about it.

1217
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,550
And he,
he traces the genealogy of the obesity

1218
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:54,350
epidemic and he goes all the way back to
the 30s in New York City and he looks at

1219
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:59,210
how ineffective all these obesity
clinics and even the science of obesity

1220
00:52:59,211 --> 00:52:59,960
has been.

1221
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,990
It's been so difficult because a lot of
times they treated it like it was a

1222
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:04,970
psychological disease.
Like you eat too much,

1223
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,340
so you'd go to a psychiatrist,
um,

1224
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,980
or they would put you on these very
restrictive diets,

1225
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,560
1200 calories a day and you would lose
weight.

1226
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:13,760
But at the end of the day,
you descend,

1227
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,030
but also your body gets into this state
of panic.

1228
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,740
Yes.
It tries to store energy.

1229
00:53:18,741 --> 00:53:20,540
Yes.
Really quickly because it's worried that

1230
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,680
you're in a famine state,
right?

1231
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,800
So what he traces in,
and he looks at the native Americans

1232
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,040
that were,
had to sort of

1233
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,050
get,
get on government rations when their

1234
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,810
land was taken and they all blew up like
balloons because they were given white

1235
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,980
flour.
And the,

1236
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:36,600
the thesis of the book is essentially
that when you eat simple carbohydrates

1237
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:39,780
and a lot of carbohydrates,
especially things like white flour and

1238
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:42,270
sugar,
your body produces a lot of insulin.

1239
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,910
And for a whole bunch of metal metabolic
reasons,

1240
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,740
it's insulin that causes you to retain
fat molecules and need more sugar for

1241
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:51,840
energy.
And he does a really great job in the

1242
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,130
buffet,
a book of explaining it.

1243
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,140
Um,
but that sort of,

1244
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,100
you know,
when,

1245
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,870
when you look at it that way and when
you look at the fact that it's just a

1246
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:03,450
question of changing what you put into
your body,

1247
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,710
uh,
you know,

1248
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,650
you will then eventually at this Keto
Diet,

1249
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:10,200
for example,
it's a really good way to lose weight

1250
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:11,970
and not have to restrict your calories.

1251
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,310
It just is now.
I don't know if it's for everybody.

1252
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,620
Uh,
there is a single die that's for

1253
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:17,790
everybody.
I don't either.

1254
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,400
I don't either.
Those bodies are differently.

1255
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,010
Obviously people have different
allergies to foods like or allergies,

1256
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,260
all sorts of things like that.
It's,

1257
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,250
that's a great indication that we're
just,

1258
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,170
there's so much biological diversity,
so many people have genetics that have

1259
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:33,270
come from all sorts of different parts
of the world,

1260
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,720
all sorts of different environments that
we evolve from.

1261
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:41,790
There's no one single dime for obesity
is fairly recent only because when

1262
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:46,740
people started eating that much sugar,
but you know the think that's universal,

1263
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,870
right?
Like there's nothing wrong with eating a

1264
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:51,030
certain amount of carbs and breads and
Pastas,

1265
00:54:51,031 --> 00:54:54,540
but it is universal that massive amounts
of sugar bad for you.

1266
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,300
There's no,
I don't think there's any question any

1267
00:54:56,301 --> 00:54:58,340
more scientifically,
but one of the things,

1268
00:54:58,341 --> 00:55:01,260
it's hard for a very fat people,
obese people who have trouble with this,

1269
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:05,620
who may have gotten caught into that
pattern as kids at or they have.

1270
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,400
And it's very true that some people
genetically do put weight on.

1271
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,860
They don't process carbs the way other
people do.

1272
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:12,990
Like I can eat carbs all day and stay
very thin.

1273
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,020
Some people just can't do that,
but for a long time,

1274
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,700
very active.
I'm very active,

1275
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:21,060
but for a long time what I'm saying is
that there's always been instilled as a

1276
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:22,830
stigma,
which is your fat,

1277
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:27,560
which means you are a of weak character
or you have a faulty character you're

1278
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:29,250
about,
and that's why they take so much shit.

1279
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:32,610
Whereas Gary Tab and his books had a lot
of it was just the fact that people

1280
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:37,080
didn't know how the body worked and a
lot of this information came out in

1281
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:39,900
Germany before the war.
There were these Austrian and German

1282
00:55:39,901 --> 00:55:43,860
scientists that we're really closing in
on what insulin does to make you gain

1283
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:44,880
weight,
but guess what?

1284
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,450
When the war was over,
no American scientists,

1285
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:50,330
we're going to use German data,
right?

1286
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,420
It was kind of like,
no,

1287
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:53,910
we'll come up with our own data.
We use the rocket data.

1288
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,230
We did use their rocket fucking scooped
up all their operation paperclip.

1289
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:02,080
We scooped up all their fucking rocket
scientists and made them Americans.

1290
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,600
There is a fucking thing about Wernher
von Braun being a great American and

1291
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,490
like Wernher von Braun was a fucking
Nazi.

1292
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:13,491
The guy who ran the NASA space program
was a straight up Nazi who the Simon

1293
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:16,560
Wiesenthal Center said,
if he was alive today,

1294
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,550
they would prosecute him for crimes
against humanity.

1295
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:20,384
Damn,
I didn't know that.

1296
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,280
They hung the five slowest workers every
day at his fucking

1297
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,440
rocket factory in Berlin.
Sweet guys.

1298
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,470
They've hung Jews.
They hung them in the front of the

1299
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:32,260
fucking rocket factory to encourage the
workers to work faster.

1300
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:33,970
One of the things that they,
they sit by the way,

1301
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:36,340
coming directly from people who are
still alive,

1302
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,190
who worked in that factory,
I believe with tattoos on their arm.

1303
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,740
I believe it.
I don't think that's a,

1304
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,570
I don't even think that's a point of
conjecture.

1305
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:46,840
Brazy is it that we just scooped up all
those monsters and they can.

1306
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:50,630
We all scooped out good at fucking
shooting Middle Dixon to the sky,

1307
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,410
so let's come over here.
We also,

1308
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:58,210
but we also scooped up a lot of a German
and Austrian Jewish scientists because

1309
00:56:58,211 --> 00:56:59,470
when they,
in fact,

1310
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:02,950
Einstein I believe emigrated after a
number of,

1311
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,010
or that thing was two scientists who
were Jewish were assassinated,

1312
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:07,180
was shot on the street.

1313
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,480
And so all of these like brilliant
Jewish,

1314
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,940
uh,
scientists said,

1315
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,340
uh,
let's get the fuck outta here and go to

1316
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
the UK and go to the United States.
Will tragedy of Fritz Harbor,

1317
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,160
the harbor method.
The [inaudible] method is incredible

1318
00:57:24,161 --> 00:57:27,100
stuff.
And the guy figured out a way to extract

1319
00:57:27,101 --> 00:57:29,350
nitrogen from the air and it's one of
the,

1320
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:34,351
they say today that there's a,
there's a fantastic radio lab podcast on

1321
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,600
this,
I think it's called the bad show.

1322
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,210
I think that's what it's called because
there's a,

1323
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:42,370
they did,
they did a good show in a bad show.

1324
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,500
I think that's what it's called.
And would they just showed is that

1325
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,120
sometimes,
and this,

1326
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:49,330
we've all known this,
so sometimes people that have done

1327
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:52,060
horrible,
horrible things are also amazing.

1328
00:57:52,061 --> 00:57:53,860
It's something that benefits a lot of
folks.

1329
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,730
And this is one of the classic example.
Fritz harbor figured out this way to

1330
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:02,620
extract nitrogen from the air and the
nitrogen in our bodies today.

1331
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,620
They estimate that some 50 in nitrogen
with,

1332
00:58:05,621 --> 00:58:08,110
they use it for his fertilizer and for
the longest pneumonia.

1333
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:08,921
Yeah.
Yeah.

1334
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:12,070
For the longest time they used to have
to get like dead fish or mulch or

1335
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,240
something like that.
Compost.

1336
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,070
And then the fact that Bat Guano,
yeah.

1337
00:58:15,071 --> 00:58:19,720
Back when I was a big one literally bat
shit crazy was like because people would

1338
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,520
have wars over a bat.
Shit,

1339
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,670
it's nuts that I didn't know that but I
that's exactly,

1340
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,481
yeah.
That's what it is.

1341
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:29,830
It was fucking wars over bat shit like
cause that's how you grow your food is

1342
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,540
amazing.
People would starve during the winter

1343
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,480
because they didn't know how to get that
nitrogen into the soil.

1344
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,720
And Fritz harbor is literally credited
with stopping mass scale starvation.

1345
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:43,400
But then there's the other side,
other side.

1346
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,540
Well they said that today the nitrogen
in our bodies,

1347
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:48,820
50% of it came from the hopper method.

1348
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,330
Degas though all the people today,
like literally he's responsible for a

1349
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:55,150
massive increase in the population of
this world.

1350
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,580
But he also was the guy that fucking
used gas in war for the first time.

1351
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:02,800
Not only that,
he personally oversaw it,

1352
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,740
he went to the front lines and we
started with,

1353
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:06,574
it,
started with a p,

1354
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,290
he was working on insecticides,
right?

1355
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,640
Uh,
which is by the way,

1356
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:12,580
is what Zyklon B,
which was used to gas,

1357
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,250
the Jews.
He came up with Xy,

1358
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:18,000
clown eggs,
psych on a had a smell it to it so that

1359
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,770
you could know what it was and get the
fuck away from it.

1360
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,400
Whereas B,
the Nazis

1361
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,460
extracted the smell.
He will harbor was at ju.

1362
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:30,110
So what a fucking crazy conundrum.
That guy found himself where his own

1363
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:34,370
relatives died directly from an
invention that he creates.

1364
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:36,680
Incredible.
And you know also if you,

1365
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:40,280
if you take a sympathetic approach to a
man who was a patriot,

1366
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,980
he was a patriot.
His country was at war.

1367
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,120
He had benefited from this country.
He had a legacy in this country.

1368
00:59:47,121 --> 00:59:51,380
He had standing in this country and his
country was under direct threat.

1369
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:54,740
And he said,
I think I know a way to help this war

1370
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,410
effort so we can stop the enemy and you
know,

1371
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,690
we should all again,
it's not what you think.

1372
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,020
It's how you think we should all put
ourselves in his shoes.

1373
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,880
If I had a way,
and I'm,

1374
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,480
I think I'm right about that,
if I had a way as an American is Brian

1375
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,130
Count to save my country from people I
thought were going to actually take it

1376
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:15,590
over our kill a bunch of people,
including my family.

1377
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:19,700
I'm going to gas the fuck out of them.
If I can invent a technique,

1378
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:22,670
I'm going to gas them and I'm gonna come
up a way to shoot a rocket.

1379
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,410
Adam,
that's so,

1380
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:26,780
if that makes me a bad person,
call me Fritz slow.

1381
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:31,781
Isn't it crazy though that this guy was
literally receiving the Nobel Prize for

1382
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:36,800
the harbor method at the same time for
being wanted for crimes against humanity

1383
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:41,240
for war criminal,
but the same people that want to try him

1384
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:46,241
for war crimes dropped nuclear fucking
bombs on two cities in Japan.

1385
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:50,720
Like what is a war crime?
Like when you're killing people,

1386
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:51,261
like,
oh,

1387
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:53,870
you killed people the wrong way.
Like we have rules,

1388
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,780
can't kill her.
But like,

1389
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,930
there's lemay who oversaw,
I believe,

1390
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:59,840
the bombing,
the firebombing of Tokyo.

1391
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:00,950
Uh,
and,

1392
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:02,900
uh,
December before the,

1393
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,950
the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombs,
this is the fire bombs,

1394
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:08,750
which by the way,
killed more people,

1395
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,590
did more distraught.

1396
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,960
I mean,
everybody concentrates on the D two

1397
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,230
events.
Hiroshima,

1398
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,380
Nagasaki firebombing was,
oh,

1399
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:17,660
I mean,
what we did to Dresden,

1400
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,510
what we did to the allies,
really it was the British and the

1401
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,260
Americans.
But,

1402
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,330
um,
I mean dressing looks like the surface

1403
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:24,830
of the moon.
Uh,

1404
01:01:24,831 --> 01:01:25,830
you know,
uh,

1405
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,890
Kurt Vonnegut,
I think in the book a slaughterhouse

1406
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:30,470
five talks about this and the vivid
detail,

1407
01:01:30,471 --> 01:01:35,330
but look at just youtube dresden before
and after Jimmy bring up Dresden,

1408
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:36,680
Jimmy,
before Jimmy,

1409
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:38,630
I said Jimmy said Jimmy,
right?

1410
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,700
Dresden before and after the
firebombing.

1411
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:42,980
But Curtis Lemay,
I think in a period of eight days in

1412
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:46,670
Tokyo eight and I mean,
at 1 million people died from fire and

1413
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:50,210
Curtis Lemay said business,
it wars the business of killing people.

1414
01:01:50,211 --> 01:01:54,170
And if I had been on the losing side,
I'd probably be tried as a war criminal,

1415
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,290
and if you see Curtis Lemay,
he's always chewing on a cigar and he

1416
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:01,250
was the commander and he was the one who
made those decisions and they said,

1417
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,660
we're going to punish the German
workers.

1418
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,240
They're real pictures though.
Look at what is this?

1419
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:06,590
This?
I was like Dresden.

1420
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,010
Dresden was a jewel.
It was a jewel and there's an beautiful

1421
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,450
post,
like the surface of the fucking moon.

1422
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,960
You'll see they have videos of it.
Then Jamie,

1423
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,720
this all this is before and after the
allied bombing.

1424
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:23,250
I don't know why.
It's just pictures.

1425
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:26,400
See if you can find some photos,
some actual photo.

1426
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:29,010
Beautiful Dresden Ruins after the allied
bombing.

1427
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,210
Whoa.
But this is drawing worse in that

1428
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,671
photograph.
Oh,

1429
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:33,900
that's a photo.
Yeah.

1430
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,230
There you go.
That's what it's a photo.

1431
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,890
Oh my God.
It looks like,

1432
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:38,180
Oh my God.
If it,

1433
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:40,440
all of it.
And then any time they talk about the

1434
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:44,160
survivors who were just walking around
the city that had been standing for 700

1435
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:46,830
years or something crazy and it was no
longer,

1436
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,660
how would the neighbor have survived
this?

1437
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,340
They didn't.
In fact,

1438
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:52,020
people were falling over and look at
that.

1439
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:55,380
Those are bodies.
People were falling down.

1440
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,870
Um,
they were falling down because the

1441
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:00,450
oxygen was sucked out of the air.
So you'd be,

1442
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:03,450
you'd be on the street and you would,
you would just fall down because there

1443
01:03:03,451 --> 01:03:04,360
was no air.
Yes.

1444
01:03:04,361 --> 01:03:06,870
Or there'd be a bomb and the people
would open their shutters and stick

1445
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,180
their head out and the aftershock would
take their heads off.

1446
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:12,210
Whoa.
We're very lucky.

1447
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,430
Very lucky.
We didn't live at this time.

1448
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,180
She very left Bryce.
What a fucking strange thing.

1449
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,960
[inaudible] was an apocalypse.
Giant scale war is like that.

1450
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:23,070
And,
and Europe,

1451
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:27,660
what was it a,
was it a 50 million people at the end of

1452
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:30,630
World War II that were dead?
Maybe as many as 80 million.

1453
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:35,810
Put that into context and that from
those ashes from these experiments like

1454
01:03:36,151 --> 01:03:41,151
fascism and the idea that you can
perfect human beings and perfect society

1455
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:46,410
and create utopias from those
experiments came,

1456
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,380
uh,
ash and 80 million graves.

1457
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,350
And so,
and from that came right Kinda Sorta,

1458
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,050
I mean,
the idea like if you just wanted to

1459
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:58,620
improve upon human beings without
killing people that you thought were

1460
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:01,260
inferior,
if you just wanted to create the uber

1461
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:06,190
manch without making everybody else die
without you.

1462
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:10,260
But you need to reeducate.
So reeducation camps that Pol Pot would

1463
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,960
put people in.
You had to be marched to the countryside

1464
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,370
because he was creating a,
you an agrarian utopia.

1465
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,430
But why does it always have to,
why?

1466
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,990
Why does any beneficial act like the
idea of creating better people?

1467
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,330
Like we would all like a better society
with better people.

1468
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,360
I mean if we all had a,
a world where everybody had perfect

1469
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:29,190
genetics and nobody had to worry about
fat shaming,

1470
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,740
you know,
like nobody had to worry about not being

1471
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:32,840
attractive.
Nobody helped.

1472
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,320
But that's not good.
So the problem is like the stress and

1473
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:40,810
the anxiety of being a dork and the,
the,

1474
01:04:40,811 --> 01:04:42,780
the,
the stress of being bullied.

1475
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,780
And that's where diamonds come from.
Not good to someone.

1476
01:04:48,211 --> 01:04:51,780
It's not good to take advantage of
someone.

1477
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:55,380
It's not good to make someone's life
hell.

1478
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,960
But a lot of times that's where you get
a Marvin Gaye.

1479
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,041
Of course,
you know,

1480
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,200
you get these,
these jewels of art.

1481
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,040
Yeah.
You know,

1482
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:06,060
you get these people that come out of
these horrible environments and they

1483
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:08,760
have this power to them,
but you have to create,

1484
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:09,631
you have,
you're right.

1485
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,540
You still have to create some respite.
You know,

1486
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,920
that the great,
the greatest,

1487
01:05:13,921 --> 01:05:18,240
the Great Matthew Arnold who said that
the United States is the land of the

1488
01:05:18,241 --> 01:05:21,340
stock market and big guns and,
and powerful,

1489
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:22,470
you know,
an agrarian state,

1490
01:05:22,471 --> 01:05:24,880
it can feed the land of Prince.
What he also said,

1491
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:25,780
I was going to say,
he said,

1492
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:30,930
we have to always remember to create
safe haven for our gentler spirits are

1493
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:33,260
Weirdos and people that think
differently and active.

1494
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,570
And we,
that's what you get prints,

1495
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:37,360
little Richard,
Marilyn Manson and all the things that

1496
01:05:37,361 --> 01:05:39,580
make our culture interesting.
Yeah.

1497
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:42,070
And that's a very important thing to
keep in mind when you,

1498
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:42,910
when you,
um,

1499
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,960
but again,
look,

1500
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,740
when you talk about,
um,

1501
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:50,410
bombing and how we're getting better,
think about for a second the methodology

1502
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:54,970
in our brain of how we,
a lot of people think of not only

1503
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:57,220
terrorism,
and I'm guilty of this too,

1504
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:00,430
or even say something like cancer.
So if you have cancer,

1505
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:03,160
there's one method of treating it and
sometimes it works,

1506
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:05,800
which is there's a tumor,
let's cut it out.

1507
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:09,130
Let's cut the tumor out was another
method of treating and which was diet

1508
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,920
and health and taking care of your body
before it ever happens.

1509
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,620
This is one of the things that you're
talking now about the duality is what

1510
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:18,160
I'm saying is that we,
we fall sometimes into the mindset that

1511
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:23,170
every problem can be cut out and,
and removed,

1512
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:23,500
right.

1513
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,290
Instead of saying prevention,
what you just said,

1514
01:06:26,291 --> 01:06:30,210
what you just said is there's another,
there might be another tact in,

1515
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,690
in every issue.
So when you,

1516
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,660
when we talk about,
um,

1517
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:37,000
the bad guys and we talk about,
we have to in,

1518
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:37,960
and listen,
there's,

1519
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,510
there's,
there's a place in the time to take out

1520
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,550
the bad guys.
There's no question of course,

1521
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:43,413
but,
you know,

1522
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:48,420
but we have to be careful that we have,
we don't fall into one way of thinking

1523
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:52,510
and one way of dealing with what we
consider threats.

1524
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,410
Right,
right.

1525
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,890
Because we could make the problem worse.
Um,

1526
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:59,440
and instead,
sometimes we might want to say,

1527
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,890
maybe this time,
maybe this is a problem that doesn't

1528
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:06,430
require cutting and radiation and,
uh,

1529
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,301
you know,
removing,

1530
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,750
maybe it's what you just said.
Maybe we should approach it systemically

1531
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:13,780
from a different angle that's not as,
uh,

1532
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,390
not as violent and not as physical.

1533
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,530
Yeah.
Well,

1534
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,430
there's also the problem of the
charismatic leader and there's also a

1535
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:23,770
problem of people wanting to be a part
of a team.

1536
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,800
Like you were talking about,
if you could guess the people that are a

1537
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,200
threat to the United States,
but who are those people?

1538
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,260
Cause they're just people.
The idea that somehow or another,

1539
01:07:32,261 --> 01:07:34,650
someone who lives in Italy who,
uh,

1540
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:37,510
I've never met is against me.
Uh,

1541
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,150
someone who lives in the United States
who they've never met.

1542
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,430
That's preposterous.
We just don't know each other.

1543
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,200
And when you get,
by the way,

1544
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,200
when I was in Italy,
one of the weirdest fucking things about

1545
01:07:47,201 --> 01:07:49,060
it,
and I've never been there before,

1546
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:51,400
so I don't know that,
but the people that were there were

1547
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:53,440
describing to me how everything has
changed.

1548
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,990
I was talking to this one cab driver,
it was really interesting guy.

1549
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,160
And,
uh,

1550
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,060
he was,
uh,

1551
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,670
we were commenting on,
was asking him about everywhere you

1552
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:02,710
look,
they have these land rover defenders

1553
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,920
that are in Cammo with these military
people standing out there with fucking

1554
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:08,680
machine guns everywhere,
everywhere.

1555
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,990
And I said,
is this normal?

1556
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,190
And he said,
no.

1557
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,410
He said,
this is the new way.

1558
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,590
He's like,
is a,

1559
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,100
the world

1560
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,030
is changing.
He said,

1561
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:18,710
this is not a good world.
He said,

1562
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:20,090
this is not good.
And I said,

1563
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:22,970
so this is a direct response to the
terrorist threats and the things that

1564
01:08:22,971 --> 01:08:24,110
have been happening in Paris.
He goes,

1565
01:08:24,111 --> 01:08:25,160
yes,
yes,

1566
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:25,701
yes.
He goes,

1567
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,200
they don't want it to happen here.
So,

1568
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,210
so all the places where there was
tourists,

1569
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:31,670
where was the Vatican?
Whether it was the coliseum.

1570
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,820
You saw these,
these camouflage land rover defenders in

1571
01:08:34,821 --> 01:08:38,030
these public displays,
guy's gun and a woman.

1572
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:40,160
I saw a woman,
I was thinking about punching her and

1573
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,210
taking her gun.
It's like,

1574
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,800
I think it can sound as women are no
joke know.

1575
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:45,410
I don't think so.
I got it.

1576
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:46,730
They're trained to react.
My Guy,

1577
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,900
that's my guy,
that's my gun.

1578
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,510
It wasn't obviously,
I'm kidding,

1579
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:53,150
but it is.
It is weird to see these people.

1580
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:57,680
They're standing out there holding guns
and they had fucking very serious looks

1581
01:08:57,681 --> 01:09:01,100
on their face and they're scanning the
crowd looking left and looking right in.

1582
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,610
A lot of Middle Eastern people there.
A lot of fucking people dressed up like

1583
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:08,030
beekeepers.
A lot of poor ladies with gloves on and

1584
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:10,700
Ninja masks and I was like,
what in the fuck,

1585
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:16,010
2016 and you've got people wandering the
streets of one of the greatest cities in

1586
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:19,100
the world and our liberal democracy.
I'm fucking that.

1587
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:22,970
That talks about giving people their on
the serenity on him,

1588
01:09:22,971 --> 01:09:23,804
but they were,
yeah,

1589
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:26,000
and all the women like Italian women
trust like,

1590
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:28,480
Oh yeah,
I was looking for Dick.

1591
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:31,880
Oh well they're just very,
I consider they trust their minimalists.

1592
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:33,560
Excuse me sir.
They're mental mess and they did.

1593
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:34,790
They know how to,
I'm fan.

1594
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,640
I'm a fan of hallways.
Did you see what happened in France over

1595
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:38,900
the weekend?
It's um,

1596
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,650
this man stabbed a woman and her three
children at a,

1597
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:46,580
at a resort for being scantily dressed.
This Muslim man.

1598
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,580
Oh,
what in the fuck man.

1599
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:50,330
Just,
well,

1600
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:54,170
it's such a bankrupt.
It's such a bankrupt philosophy,

1601
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:57,740
if you can even call it that.
This ideology is an ideology.

1602
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:01,430
I'm going to kill you.
I thought you talk about people who are

1603
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:02,720
caught in a trap.
These,

1604
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,830
this isis ideology talk about being
caught in a past.

1605
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:08,390
This guy,
this guy wasn't nicest.

1606
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,580
He wasn't an isis guy.
He was just some radical Muslim.

1607
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:15,230
Some someone who deeply believes what
he's been taught,

1608
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:19,370
his ideology so powerful that he's
willing to stab an eight year old kid in

1609
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:21,860
the lungs is poor fucking kid.
At a collapse.

1610
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,000
A little girl,
a little girl,

1611
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,310
cause she was wearing a beach house.
Jesus Christ.

1612
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,770
Well this is a guy.
Um,

1613
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:30,470
it sounds like you've might've been
mentally ill or the guy drove all those

1614
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:32,260
people and needs that happened while I
was there is,

1615
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,120
I didn't say it nice.

1616
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:34,910
Nice.
That happened while I was there.

1617
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,280
It was a,
well this is the other thing is again,

1618
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,380
not only do they do that because they're
fanatical,

1619
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:43,280
they think they're actually going to
change something and make the world a

1620
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:48,281
better place by,
by behaving in this mad fashion.

1621
01:10:49,101 --> 01:10:53,180
In some ways they might because they're
going to unleash the Jocko willink on

1622
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:55,760
the world who are going to go out there
and they're going to fucking kill people

1623
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:57,300
like this.
They're there.

1624
01:10:57,310 --> 01:11:01,850
They're going to fucking get people to
the point where they lose all tolerance.

1625
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,650
Well,
I'm Kinda shit point and I'm pretty

1626
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:05,600
tolerant and I'm getting to that point.
And here's the,

1627
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:07,550
here's the thing about when you think
about isis.

1628
01:11:07,551 --> 01:11:09,920
So I was talking to my buddy who's a CIA
guy,

1629
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:10,750
you know,
he's at,

1630
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:13,910
he's at Delta Guy.
He's one of these were bill kind of a

1631
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,190
guys

1632
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,170
who's in there and does all the dirty
work.

1633
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,780
And he said,
um,

1634
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:18,960
I said,
you know,

1635
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,550
let's,
why don't we just bomb,

1636
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:21,360
uh,
the,

1637
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,550
the,
their strongholds,

1638
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,600
you make a martyr.
Well,

1639
01:11:23,601 --> 01:11:24,421
no,
he also said,

1640
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:27,270
he said,
you have to understand that that's not

1641
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:30,870
like they're all camped out in one area.
They're in a town the size of,

1642
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,450
you know,
let's say Baltimore and there they have

1643
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,070
safe houses,
but for the most part,

1644
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,500
they're all over that place.
But more importantly,

1645
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,000
as Isis fighters die,
what they do is they come to families

1646
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:44,100
that are peace loving families and they
say,

1647
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:45,510
listen,
we need to,

1648
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,440
we need to conscript your son and your
two other sons.

1649
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:49,931
Right?
They're there.

1650
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:53,610
They now belong to isis.
Now you can say no and die or you can

1651
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,190
bring,
bring them over for the cause because

1652
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:57,870
you better be down cause that what's
going on.

1653
01:11:57,900 --> 01:12:00,150
That's what's going on now.
Where's this happening?

1654
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:02,430
We'll pull in the world in Syria,
in Iraq,

1655
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,140
in,
in those places where they have

1656
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:06,360
strongholds.
[inaudible] people are joining

1657
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:07,390
voluntarily.
Yes,

1658
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:07,831
yes.
They,

1659
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:11,940
including European women.
Have you seen this crazy shit where

1660
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:14,450
girls are going from England and they're
joining isis?

1661
01:12:14,451 --> 01:12:16,410
Yeah.
They're also getting their also getting

1662
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:19,190
wholesale just destroyed.
Oh Man,

1663
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:22,890
I just fucking dying.
And now isis is trying to support the

1664
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:26,980
families of the martyrs and they're
running out of money and you know,

1665
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,750
so they're losing the,
they're losing the physical battle.

1666
01:12:30,751 --> 01:12:34,500
But the ideology is always going to
inspire fuck faces.

1667
01:12:34,501 --> 01:12:37,980
Like this guy who kills children.
And I think in that case,

1668
01:12:38,010 --> 01:12:40,530
you know,
you do need a strong presence and people

1669
01:12:40,531 --> 01:12:42,750
willing to shoot those people before
they do what they do.

1670
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,370
It's really hard to prevent though.
Well,

1671
01:12:44,371 --> 01:12:46,320
it's hard to prevent crazy people.

1672
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,330
Yeah.
And the word crazy is not the right

1673
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:50,610
word.
It's hard to prevent even addicts,

1674
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,430
psychopaths,
it's hard to prevent people.

1675
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:54,300
Like,
I mean,

1676
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:57,990
forget religious ideology.
The guy who fucking shot up those people

1677
01:12:57,991 --> 01:13:00,670
in the movie theater in Colorado.
It's hard to prevent that.

1678
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:01,390
Yeah.
It's,

1679
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,310
it's hard to,
I mean that,

1680
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:04,140
that happened more than once.
Right?

1681
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:05,730
I mean,
how many times people didn't,

1682
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:08,040
someone gets shot up in Amy Schumer's
movie.

1683
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,320
The one where there are people that went
to see train wreck that was right,

1684
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:13,921
right.
Yeah.

1685
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:15,890
And because she was a,
what would you set up?

1686
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,350
What do you think is the answer?
I mean it's a good question.

1687
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,050
The answer is the answer.
This is a little bit radical,

1688
01:13:21,051 --> 01:13:23,840
but is the answer.
Let all of us carry a gun.

1689
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,320
How are you gonna stop that truck with a
gun?

1690
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,350
I don't know.
The trucks are more dangerous than guns,

1691
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,220
you know,
it's fucked up.

1692
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:35,870
I kind of predicted that that truck
attack during the Steven crowder

1693
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:37,850
podcasts and I didn't even realize I did
it.

1694
01:13:38,060 --> 01:13:40,040
Somebody posted on the integrator in the
Internet,

1695
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,950
like a clip of it.
Like what's to stop someone?

1696
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,540
Cause we were talking about gun control
and I'm like,

1697
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:47,900
the problem is mentally insane.
People that are willing to kill people

1698
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,030
and they could do it a lot of ways,
man.

1699
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:52,250
And I was like,
what's to stop someone from taking a car

1700
01:13:52,251 --> 01:13:54,260
and driving through a fucking crowd of
people.

1701
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:55,330
There's not much you can do

1702
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,840
about it,
but you can't shoot him in the face so

1703
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:02,010
that they die in the car.
Maybe I do get lucky

1704
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,280
hit them.
You know how hard it is to shoot at

1705
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:06,170
someone when they're driving at you in a
car.

1706
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:10,190
It's hard to shoot a deer that's
standing still and in you resting your

1707
01:14:10,191 --> 01:14:12,520
gun on a rock.
But it's possible.

1708
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,060
It's possible.
I'd rather have that answer then have to

1709
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:19,150
run and scream with my kids.
I'd rather be able to stand my ground

1710
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:20,920
and fucking squeeze off,
you know?

1711
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,740
Right.
Six rounds in his direction.

1712
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:25,330
And I really mean that.
You'd know it's,

1713
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,100
it's,
there's an argument there and I think

1714
01:14:27,101 --> 01:14:28,570
the argument against that,
that,

1715
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:31,210
you know,
you should not have that because you're

1716
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:33,100
more likely to kill someone in your
family.

1717
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,920
And you know,
that's not a great argument either.

1718
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:39,040
I think on both sides,
like the real issue is mental health.

1719
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,850
The real issue is inequality.
The real issue is people growing up.

1720
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,140
And,
and when I say inequality,

1721
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:45,670
I don't necessarily even mean rights.

1722
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,060
I mean in the environment in which your
soul enters this world.

1723
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:52,420
Like what,
what,

1724
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,610
what is the environment that you and I
entered?

1725
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:56,530
Well,
we have really nice parents and we got

1726
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:58,820
really lucky.
We got born in America and we didn't,

1727
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,750
we even born American,
born in the Philippines,

1728
01:15:01,751 --> 01:15:03,970
there's Jesus Christ.
I was 14 years old,

1729
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,090
barely 100 different countries too.
I get my edge.

1730
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,641
But you,
you,

1731
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:09,670
you got lucky.
You have a really nice family.

1732
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,660
You know,
I got lucky,

1733
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,730
great family,
like Nice people.

1734
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,920
You know,
that's very fortunate.

1735
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:19,900
If you were born in Iraq or in Saudi
Arabia or in Afghanistan or in any of

1736
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:23,590
these places where they're dealing with
these ancient ideologies,

1737
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,330
you're fucked.
It's like,

1738
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:30,480
it's like there's a race and the race is
30 miles long and you're starting out at

1739
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,340
mile one where some people are at mile
29 like there's no way.

1740
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:38,950
It's no way this is fair.
It's no way.

1741
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,930
It's just not fair.
And there's gotta be a way through

1742
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,960
either time or effort or just the sheer
expression of ideas that permeate

1743
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:54,880
through this world where it slowly,
yeah,

1744
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:59,320
slowly but surely things have to even
out to the point where people realize

1745
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,630
the correct way to behave and treat
people.

1746
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,880
Look,
you could say religious tolerance all

1747
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,680
you want,
but when there's a fucking woman dress

1748
01:16:05,681 --> 01:16:10,360
like a Ninja at the mall,
that lady is not in a good place.

1749
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,910
She,
she's being forced to dress like that.

1750
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:15,580
This is not her idea.
There's no way it is.

1751
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:20,790
This is an idea that was stuck into her
life when she was a small person and she

1752
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:24,100
grew up with that idea and now she's
married to some guy who enforces that

1753
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:27,490
idea and this guy's walking around with
a fucking golf shirt on and his wife's

1754
01:16:27,491 --> 01:16:28,330
dress like a Ninja.

1755
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:28,871
I mean,
it says,

1756
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:31,750
man,
I think that it makes their country

1757
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,430
weaker if you get,
yeah,

1758
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,920
you guys arise and,
and,

1759
01:16:35,921 --> 01:16:39,460
and you know,
creates these sort of fencing around an

1760
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:44,140
entire class of people and agenda.
If you take women and say,

1761
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,540
you guys have to walk a little bit
behind me.

1762
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,730
You have,
we just know that that doesn't work.

1763
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:51,450
You're wasting a lot of human potential.
Yes.

1764
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,340
A lot of people with ideas that can make
the world a better place.

1765
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:55,460
And you also,
you're,

1766
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:57,790
you're stifling the debate and the
discussion.

1767
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:59,590
Look,
there's a lot of people that think

1768
01:16:59,591 --> 01:17:00,460
different than me,
man.

1769
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:04,570
A lot of people,
whether they're from different parts of

1770
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:08,200
the world or whether they have different
likes or dislikes and they have

1771
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:09,034
different,
uh,

1772
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,270
art that they appreciate.
And I,

1773
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,570
I like hearing their point of view.
There's a lot of people that I don't

1774
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:17,600
agree with what they're saying and I
like to hear what they say.

1775
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:21,380
There's radical feminists that I
listened to their ideology and

1776
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:24,080
unlistened to what they're saying.
And I try to figure out where the fuck

1777
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:25,810
they're coming from.
I try to figure,

1778
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:28,520
okay,
is this a direct response to something

1779
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:31,640
they've experienced in their life?
Like how much of this has to deal with

1780
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:34,490
them being persecuted?
How much of them it has to,

1781
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:39,520
how much of what people say has to do
with their direct experiences with the

1782
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:44,480
opposite sex.
Like when you look at a bunch of

1783
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:45,530
feminists,
right?

1784
01:17:45,531 --> 01:17:49,680
And some of them have pink hair and they
weigh 300 pounds and you,

1785
01:17:49,690 --> 01:17:51,890
you know,
life was not fucking awesome for them

1786
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:53,750
around men.
You just know it wasn't he?

1787
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:58,250
Well,
how much of this anti male sort of

1788
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:00,950
ideology that they're espousing,
like how much of that comes from their

1789
01:18:00,951 --> 01:18:04,400
direct experiences with men and how
different would it be if they grew up

1790
01:18:04,401 --> 01:18:06,070
looking like Julia Roberts?
Right.

1791
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:07,243
I mean,
a lot.

1792
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,650
Really good.
Um,

1793
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:12,690
one of the things I do with my podcast,
the Brian Council now is I do,

1794
01:18:12,691 --> 01:18:13,351
wait a minute,
wait a minute,

1795
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,820
wait a minute.
You have a podcast?

1796
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,780
I have a,
I have,

1797
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,440
I have the fight in the Cayman.
Wait,

1798
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:18,150
wait a minute,
Wayne.

1799
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:20,250
Man,
you brought back the Brian Cowen.

1800
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:23,580
Shall I ha I do it once a week and I
talk about a book about this.

1801
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,640
I sent you,
I sent you one of them just for you to

1802
01:18:26,641 --> 01:18:27,960
listen to because I did it with this
guy,

1803
01:18:27,961 --> 01:18:28,990
Hunter Mountain.
I don't listen.

1804
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,510
He was brilliant.
Just tell you right now.

1805
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:34,590
I sent it to here like whatever.
But it was a super busy,

1806
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,910
we had an amazing,
I'm very,

1807
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,470
very busy,
but I had an amazing conversation with

1808
01:18:38,670 --> 01:18:41,000
my buddy hunter that amazing.
Like you can't believe it happened.

1809
01:18:41,001 --> 01:18:42,360
Is it more?
It was good.

1810
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,500
My buddy hunter is really good at
reading everything and putting it in the

1811
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:47,910
context where I can understand it.

1812
01:18:47,970 --> 01:18:48,930
You know what I mean?
Like he,

1813
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,820
he can put it,
he can create useful,

1814
01:18:50,850 --> 01:18:52,980
he can turn it into a useful,
you know what I mean?

1815
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,500
But you can read a bunch of books but
you don't have to put it together.

1816
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:58,740
This motherfucker can put it all
together and contextualizes it and

1817
01:18:58,741 --> 01:19:00,720
everything else.
And we read this book,

1818
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:01,890
we'll read a book and then talk about
it.

1819
01:19:01,891 --> 01:19:05,760
So we read this book called the secret
of their success at the secret of our

1820
01:19:05,761 --> 01:19:08,220
success by Joseph Henrik.
And the book is,

1821
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,820
the theme of the book is basically this
and it's to your point,

1822
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:15,600
human beings are smart because they
borrow culture.

1823
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:20,870
Human beings are smart because they have
societies that excel have to be open and

1824
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:26,010
have to be open enough so that they can
borrow the best things from other

1825
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,210
cultures.
So for example,

1826
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:31,890
if you and I are put in the middle of
the Arctic would get a flat unless we

1827
01:19:31,891 --> 01:19:33,010
find a bunch of Innuendo.

1828
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,730
We're dead in about three days.
You know,

1829
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:39,600
if you and I are in the Amazon,
if you take an intuit who can kick ass

1830
01:19:39,601 --> 01:19:41,850
and find seal meat and everything else
and put them in the Amazon,

1831
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,020
he's fun.
He doesn't know,

1832
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:46,530
he doesn't have the culture.
Human beings survive and grow and excel

1833
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:50,190
because we are really good at learning
from each other,

1834
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,640
borrowing ideas.
It's called the diffusion of innovation.

1835
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,250
We are,
that's the most important thing.

1836
01:19:56,251 --> 01:20:01,251
And when you have societies that have
these strong rules and the strong

1837
01:20:02,191 --> 01:20:06,030
ideologies that keep people essentially
restricted,

1838
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:07,980
you are not to have

1839
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,070
the free flow exchange of ideas.
Look at,

1840
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:13,290
for example,
mixed martial arts.

1841
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:18,300
Think about where martial arts has come
once the ultimate fighting championship

1842
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:21,960
and the grace he's created this crazy
thing where everybody got to fight

1843
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,180
everybody else.
Pretty soon everybody starts sharing

1844
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:26,380
secrets.
Everybody starts to Kinda like go,

1845
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,600
this works,
this doesn't work.

1846
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,120
And you were putting it in an arena
where you were actually,

1847
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:32,640
it was just a very open place.
It was the people who have been ground.

1848
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:35,700
It was a proven ground and you could
borrow ideas and people are,

1849
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:38,400
look at what they're doing now,
their borrower coaches here,

1850
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:41,360
I have this idea in submissions and
kickboxing and all this.

1851
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:45,360
That's how societies,
that's how innovation happens.

1852
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:48,030
That's the best way to get ideas to move
forward.

1853
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:51,840
And again,
the problem with Wa this sort of

1854
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,880
countries that are restrictive like
Russia,

1855
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:59,300
like Saudi Arabia with the strong sort
of either cultures of power or cultures

1856
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:04,260
of religion is that they create um,
a very,

1857
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:06,030
very,
it's a very difficult atmosphere.

1858
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:09,600
Not only,
not only to be open with your ideas but,

1859
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:14,250
but to benefit from your ideas.
You are not going to start a company

1860
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:19,251
like apple in Russia when you know that
the government like Putin or whoever is

1861
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:23,670
co could take it anytime they want.
Where would be the incentive that I'm

1862
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:25,950
going to work for 20 years.
He's buddies with Putin.

1863
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,480
Exactly.
Might be able to pull it off,

1864
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:30,570
but you'll never do it in Saudi Arabia.
Now it's an economy of influence,

1865
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,000
not a meritocracy.
Let me ask you this,

1866
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:35,340
cause this is a kind of an interesting
thought that's going through my head.

1867
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:39,990
Do you think that one of the things
that's going on today that just really

1868
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:44,910
wasn't going on,
I mean in the 70s you had the Iran

1869
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:48,000
hostage crisis with Jimmy Carter and all
that jazz,

1870
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:51,690
but if you really go back and think
about what that was all about and if you

1871
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:55,410
really look at the history of the United
States intervention in the Middle East,

1872
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,920
it was really about controlling
resources,

1873
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:01,380
controlling now also controlling Soviet
influence.

1874
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:02,850
Yeah,
controlling Soviet influence,

1875
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,920
but that was also about resources too
because they were trying to,

1876
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,650
the mujahideen,
they were trying to control Afghanistan

1877
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:10,050
and they had wanted to get the natural
gas pipelines and there's,

1878
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:14,550
there's a lot of it to that deals with
monopolizing natural resources and the

1879
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:15,810
amount of money that you can get from
there.

1880
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,990
And then also the amount of natural
resources that could be used to

1881
01:22:18,991 --> 01:22:21,180
strengthen military,
you know,

1882
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,670
a regimes there.
There's,

1883
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:27,480
there's a lot of control issues in that,
but you didn't have the kind of

1884
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:30,780
terrorist activity that you're having
today,

1885
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,990
which also coincides with the freedom
and expression of ideas and information

1886
01:22:36,271 --> 01:22:39,030
at an unprecedented rate that we're all
experiencing today.

1887
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:44,300
And the areas where this is not true.
The areas where the freedom of

1888
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:48,510
expression and the tolerance of ideas,
I mean if you look at the United States,

1889
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:52,620
there's some some nonsense that's going
on today with political correctness and

1890
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:57,270
there's some complete the the the the
left that's taken so far left that it

1891
01:22:57,271 --> 01:23:02,271
almost becomes right because they're
just completely trolling but could not

1892
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:08,391
just controlling but so,
so infatuated with the idea of enforcing

1893
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:15,460
their version of what equality is,
equality is and what life is on

1894
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:16,240
everybody else.

1895
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,400
That it becomes this like,
oh this is radical.

1896
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,200
You've very tyrannical.
But point is this is this is the,

1897
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,120
the west,
I mean this is where we are.

1898
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:30,121
We are in the real marketplace of ideas.
This is the boiling point of all these

1899
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:36,271
ideas where things are changing at this
radical rate and this is the world that

1900
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:41,461
is also being attacked and really being
opposed by this completely constricted

1901
01:23:43,721 --> 01:23:45,970
world that really doesn't feel like it
has a chance.

1902
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:50,410
Like this world is trying desperately to
cling to these old ways.

1903
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:52,570
D I mean if you look at,
look what Isis is,

1904
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,960
they are desperately trying to cling to
these ancient religious ideologies that

1905
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:03,460
were established in,
in a way that does not allow for the

1906
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:07,090
even exchange of ideas and information
and this,

1907
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:11,560
this new way of,
but this is also this new way,

1908
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:14,200
is also attached of course,
to the military industrial complex.

1909
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,670
It's also attached to that the idea that
there's hundreds of different,

1910
01:24:17,671 --> 01:24:21,250
some different military bases and
hundreds of different countries where

1911
01:24:21,251 --> 01:24:23,170
we're in control of massive,

1912
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,080
the mountains has been,
has been noted.

1913
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:26,680
It hasn't been,
you know,

1914
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:30,990
terrorism by the way of the 70s I
remember being in Rome airport,

1915
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:33,990
they had plenty of guys with machine
guns because of their red book Grit

1916
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:35,340
Brigade.
There was timing as terrorism.

1917
01:24:35,341 --> 01:24:38,640
There was Palestinian terrorists and
back then when they killed the people,

1918
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:39,830
the Olympics,
Munich,

1919
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:41,390
yeah,
there was always terrorist,

1920
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:45,030
but a much smaller scale than today.
Much smaller.

1921
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:48,030
I don't know about that.
I don't know if that's true because

1922
01:24:48,031 --> 01:24:51,540
terrorism was a terrorism.
There was never anything like isis

1923
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:53,040
before.
No,

1924
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,480
there wasn't there.
This is a new thing and I,

1925
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,290
I,
but this really powerful,

1926
01:24:58,291 --> 01:25:01,860
but I have to stop you there because,
because when you say there wasn't

1927
01:25:01,861 --> 01:25:02,960
anything,
like I said,

1928
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:04,560
you're right.
But for example,

1929
01:25:04,561 --> 01:25:08,250
in Indonesia,
which was essentially an American ally,

1930
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:10,380
uh,
in Indonesia,

1931
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:14,820
had I just lost my yet,
take a look at how many people in one

1932
01:25:14,821 --> 01:25:19,821
year died during the communist purge and
I think it was 1965 by many,

1933
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,830
many accounts.
The,

1934
01:25:22,831 --> 01:25:25,620
uh,
there were probably 1 million people,

1935
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:29,430
most of whom were sort of take the
commando oxy,

1936
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:32,910
they were the sort of civilian
conscripts that the military kind of

1937
01:25:32,911 --> 01:25:37,830
recruited and said,
find us the communists in your villages.

1938
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:42,540
And they were marched down to the river.
They had their heads chopped off and by

1939
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:46,200
many accounts,
almost a million quote unquote

1940
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:51,201
communists in a period of about a year
in Indonesia were slaughtered.

1941
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,610
Let's take a look.
These are all related,

1942
01:25:53,611 --> 01:25:55,680
but no one's saying that.
That that my point is,

1943
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:56,260
is

1944
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:01,260
what I'm trying to get at is I wonder if
what is going on now is almost the same

1945
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:03,260
thing that's going on with like a two
party system.

1946
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:08,210
It's an US versus them thing,
but it's combined with the os which is

1947
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:10,250
this what's going on in the western
world.

1948
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:12,740
I mean obviously the Western world has
plenty of problems,

1949
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:17,480
but one thing the western world has
pretty clearly is the even exchange of

1950
01:26:17,481 --> 01:26:20,510
information and ideas.
You might not agree with these ideas and

1951
01:26:20,511 --> 01:26:23,300
you might mean and then that's it.
There's a problem with that as well,

1952
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:25,010
but,
but you have access to them,

1953
01:26:25,011 --> 01:26:27,650
you have access to them and this access
is like,

1954
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:30,830
well that's one of the things that's
going on with twitter and I dunno if you

1955
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:32,660
know about this,
but Milo Yiannopoulos,

1956
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:33,494
you know what he is?
Yeah.

1957
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,460
He got banned from twitter for writing a
bad review about ghostbusters,

1958
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,320
which essentially confirms what he said
about the regressive left is that

1959
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:46,070
they're trying to stifle ideas like w
and then they're saying that he's

1960
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:49,770
responsible for the harassment of Leslie
Jones.

1961
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,800
Right.
Which is horrible.

1962
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:54,260
You know what people did.
She's a fucking comedian.

1963
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:55,100
She's awesome.
Great.

1964
01:26:55,101 --> 01:26:56,720
She's not great.
She's funny shit,

1965
01:26:56,721 --> 01:26:58,240
man.
Um,

1966
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,960
but also this is just trolls,
right?

1967
01:27:00,970 --> 01:27:02,930
You're always going to have trolls.
But he didn't do that.

1968
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:05,390
He didn't,
he's not responsible for,

1969
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:08,090
he didn't like sending them who wasn't
the catalyst to the,

1970
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:11,750
yeah.
But what he did was make an incredible

1971
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:16,040
amount of sense when he was describing
that you cannot make fun of this movie.

1972
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:18,680
You cannot criticize this movie if you
do,

1973
01:27:18,681 --> 01:27:21,200
you're labeled a massage.
Dennis and he talked about how

1974
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:25,150
preposterous this movie is that these
women are all kicking ass and every man,

1975
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:28,460
the movie a buffoon and the women don't
have any negative traits or qualities at

1976
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,630
all.
They're there.

1977
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:32,030
They're super powerful and super awesome
and hilarious.

1978
01:27:32,031 --> 01:27:36,350
And the humor is nonexistent because
they put them in this restrictive box.

1979
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:38,150
He got banned from twitter for that
band,

1980
01:27:38,151 --> 01:27:39,170
for twitter,
for this you,

1981
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:39,990
you what?
They've,

1982
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:44,650
they're blaming him on the harassment
that Leslie experience inside of the

1983
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,760
inside anything.
He made a provocative article about a

1984
01:27:49,761 --> 01:27:52,550
piece of art and that's what that movie
is a piece of art.

1985
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:55,130
So they are,
they are guilty of censorship in the,

1986
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:56,270
in the worst way.
Well,

1987
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:00,000
what they're doing is they're stifling
ideas they don't agree with and they've,

1988
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:04,640
they've decided that the twitter
established some weird fucking thing

1989
01:28:04,641 --> 01:28:08,180
called the trust and Security Council or
something like that.

1990
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,060
And they brought all these social dress
justice words.

1991
01:28:11,210 --> 01:28:13,460
Jamie looked at up,
what the fuck is that called?

1992
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,520
That they tried to do,
but they brought on all these people for

1993
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:17,810
this.
I was like mouth China.

1994
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,930
But Chase is Christ very,
very bizarre.

1995
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,690
It is thought,
well look,

1996
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:25,370
I'm against harassment.

1997
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:28,340
If you could stop people from being
shitty to people and you say,

1998
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:30,560
well,
here's someone who's using twitter and

1999
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:32,660
they're going after people in a very
shitty way.

2000
01:28:32,661 --> 01:28:37,661
But the problem with that is look at how
many fucking people have made shitty,

2001
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:42,410
horrible,
evil comments about police officers.

2002
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:45,680
All police officers,
trust and safety council.

2003
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:48,380
When it comes to safety,
everyone plays a role.

2004
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,180
Please make that larger so I can read
it.

2005
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:54,890
Powers.
Twitter empowers every voice to shape

2006
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:57,650
the world,
but you can't do that unless you feel

2007
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:01,950
safe and confident enough to express
yourself freely and with the world

2008
01:29:01,951 --> 01:29:05,310
around you to help give your voice more
power.

2009
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:08,910
Twitter does not tolerate behavior
intended to harass,

2010
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:12,420
intimidate,
or use fear to silence another user's

2011
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:13,440
voice.
Very general,

2012
01:29:13,441 --> 01:29:14,730
by the way,
listening in general then,

2013
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,470
so now you have a council that is
deciding whether or not your good enough

2014
01:29:19,471 --> 01:29:20,520
for twitter as well.

2015
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:22,110
You know what the first thing they did
with him?

2016
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:23,370
They couldn't figure out what to do with
him.

2017
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,220
They took away his verification.
Wow.

2018
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:26,990
What?
What?

2019
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:28,200
What does that have to do with,
wow,

2020
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,300
what does that,
he's not verified anymore.

2021
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,890
They took away a little blue chat.
Yeah,

2022
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:34,380
it's very dangerous.
It's a very dangerous,

2023
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,510
slippery slope.
But we see the scenario.

2024
01:29:36,530 --> 01:29:39,390
Universities,
you do exactly the same thing.

2025
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,390
When they did that,
he gained 20,000 new followers

2026
01:29:42,391 --> 01:29:45,210
immediately because there was a massive
backlash.

2027
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,740
Yeah.
So now they're in a place where there is

2028
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:51,741
even more backlash because if you look
at the actual words that he typed versus

2029
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,870
what they're accusing him of,
and it just doesn't stack up,

2030
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:58,080
it's clear that they don't like him
because he's a Republican.

2031
01:29:58,081 --> 01:30:01,950
He's a trump supporter.
He and he is a fucking troll.

2032
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,660
I love him.
I think he's hilarious.

2033
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,050
He's a troll.
But in the marketplace of ideas,

2034
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:11,520
you should be able to combat his
trolling behavior.

2035
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:16,290
The thing I gag without gagging,
without gagging and engage him,

2036
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:19,980
engage him in a debate and a vigorous
spirit.

2037
01:30:19,981 --> 01:30:22,350
Exactly.
Gag The guy.

2038
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:24,720
Right.
If you really feel like he has done

2039
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:26,970
something egregious,
if he's done something that can be

2040
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:28,290
criticized,
criticized it.

2041
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:31,110
That's right.
And if he's actually harassing people,

2042
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:33,570
if he's actually saying,
Hey,

2043
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:37,680
go find Leslie Jones and,
and throw dog shit at,

2044
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:40,800
or do something horrible to her or slash
or tires or something like that,

2045
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:42,850
he's actually doing something like that.
Yeah.

2046
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:46,380
Then you know that he's doing,
that's where the,

2047
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:49,620
that you don't get up in a crowded movie
theater and scream fire because you'll

2048
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:50,530
create a stampede.
Yeah,

2049
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:51,331
right.
Exactly.

2050
01:30:51,331 --> 01:30:55,170
You know my Angela talked about that
when she said where the Ku Ku Klux Klan

2051
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:58,950
was saying we have a freedom of speech
and my Angela said you're a freedom

2052
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,670
ends.

2053
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:02,730
Your freedom of speech can end when
you're literally telling people to hang

2054
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:06,030
me and you're telling a mob and I'm
standing right there that,

2055
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:07,580
that the inciting them.
That's,

2056
01:31:07,610 --> 01:31:10,770
that's probably where you know we should
take a look at things.

2057
01:31:10,771 --> 01:31:12,120
I mean,
and we all know,

2058
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,780
we all know the line.
What we don't know about what,

2059
01:31:15,781 --> 01:31:16,351
no,
I'm saying,

2060
01:31:16,351 --> 01:31:20,460
I'm saying that that there is something
called common decency and you know

2061
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:22,620
people like to jump to these extremes
but it's not,

2062
01:31:22,650 --> 01:31:25,710
it doesn't inform the debate.
I think what you're saying is so

2063
01:31:25,711 --> 01:31:29,550
important and then the idea that you've
got to create a safe haven for those

2064
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:34,110
that you agree with and disagree with.
Disagree with Milo all the time.

2065
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:36,240
I mean,
he and I are friends and I've had him on

2066
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:38,460
the podcast twice.
And when we talk,

2067
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:40,350
I'm mock them when we have fun.

2068
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:41,970
I mean,
but he's a good guy,

2069
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:46,500
but he's just really right wing.
I also think his trolling is so fucking

2070
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:50,850
sophisticated and he's one of the ones
that was saying that he believes that

2071
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:52,260
Melania,
how do you say her name?

2072
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:53,143
Trust.
Why trump?

2073
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,060
Melania?
Is that her name?

2074
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,490
Yeah.
He thinks that they did it on purpose.

2075
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:00,520
He thinks trump is a master troll and he
thinks that the plagiarism was on

2076
01:32:00,521 --> 01:32:04,180
purpose because now more people are
talking about it and then more people

2077
01:32:04,181 --> 01:32:06,550
are,
I don't know if that's true,

2078
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:11,500
but I think it's hilarious that you did,
you know that his tweet,

2079
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:17,100
trump's tweet that he put out to
congratulate his wife for speaking is

2080
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:23,401
exactly verbatim the same tweet that
Obama put out to congratulate his wife

2081
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,490
or speaking.
Interesting.

2082
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,080
Exactly.
Wow.

2083
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:34,030
Every single word in the exact same
order.

2084
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:35,410
Wow.
Yes.

2085
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:35,980
Uh,
that's,

2086
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:37,000
that's pretty calculated.

2087
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:39,730
I don't know.
I don't think he writes his own tweets.

2088
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:43,650
That apparently wasn't true.
Is it fake photoshopped?

2089
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:44,583
Oh,
this motherfucker,

2090
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,300
they got me.
So that was the thing they did.

2091
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:49,600
I'm sorry about that folks.
That's another thing that they did with

2092
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:51,880
the Leslie Jones,
which she was really upset is that

2093
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:54,860
trolls were taking words,
um,

2094
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:59,590
and putting them like they were taking a
photoshop and making her like her name,

2095
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:00,510
like what she had,
you know,

2096
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:04,690
heard her twitter name and then writing
horrible shit about gay people and then

2097
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:05,950
putting it in there.
Jesus.

2098
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:09,160
But Leslie Jones and again,
I love her.

2099
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,060
I think she's really funny.
She said some kind of fucked up things

2100
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,450
on,
on twitter herself and you know,

2101
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:20,440
things that can be construed as racist.
One of the things she said about white

2102
01:33:20,441 --> 01:33:22,600
people being shit,
fuck white people,

2103
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:23,860
Shit.
Like something like that.

2104
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:26,110
It was a on on Breitbart.
See if you could,

2105
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,760
you'd find the actual,
uh,

2106
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,860
things that they were,
there were saying that like,

2107
01:33:29,861 --> 01:33:32,290
how could Leslie Jones get away with
saying this?

2108
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:37,770
But Milo gets banned for writing an
article and I'm not you ma'am.

2109
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,170
But I think what Leslie said,
like white people,

2110
01:33:41,171 --> 01:33:44,440
Shit,
it could've been that she was saying

2111
01:33:44,441 --> 01:33:46,930
like,
someone did something and Goddamn white

2112
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:48,370
people,
this is some white people,

2113
01:33:48,371 --> 01:33:49,180
Shit.
You know,

2114
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:52,270
like she's funny.
Like when people climb into a zoo and

2115
01:33:52,271 --> 01:33:54,910
try to fucking hug a tiger,
that's why people,

2116
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:56,830
that's why people shit.
That's funny though.

2117
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:58,530
And let's say anybody who knows let's,
no,

2118
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,500
she's great.
She's just that fucking Dall Lord have

2119
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:03,820
mercy white people.
Shit.

2120
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,400
What does that mean though?
It's white people shit.

2121
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:07,960
Like they do,
I mean,

2122
01:34:07,961 --> 01:34:10,360
what does that mean?
Like why did she say that?

2123
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,910
Like what is that about?
Who imagine a white person,

2124
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:15,910
but look at this,
imagine a white person saying that about

2125
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:17,110
black people.
I understand,

2126
01:34:17,111 --> 01:34:18,370
but I think I,
you know,

2127
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:19,740
we've heard this before,
we,

2128
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:23,760
it's fine.
Leslie Jones is not a racist and Leslie

2129
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,540
Jones's,
it never been anything but really kind

2130
01:34:25,541 --> 01:34:26,740
to people around her.
Okay.

2131
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:29,890
But hold on a second because sometimes
people say things that are racist and

2132
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:31,700
they're not racist.
They're just trying to be fun.

2133
01:34:31,701 --> 01:34:32,590
Yes.
Like,

2134
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:34,840
you know,
I mean how many 2 cents and if sometimes

2135
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:39,190
the Jeff Ross is hilarious and he says a
lot of racial stuff when he exerts

2136
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,480
Silberman.
Sarah Silverman.

2137
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:44,260
But Jeff Ross in particular because he's
really good at roasting people and a lot

2138
01:34:44,261 --> 01:34:45,910
of the stuff that he says like,
you know,

2139
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:49,630
he crosses what some people would say is
align but what is he doing?

2140
01:34:49,631 --> 01:34:51,250
He's being funny.
There is,

2141
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,810
there is a difference.
So a lot of times if you're Hispanic,

2142
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:56,980
um,
if you're,

2143
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,130
you know,
you're from

2144
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,330
a marginalized group,
you can get away with it because you all

2145
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:07,331
share in a common experience of
repression,

2146
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:10,160
right?
So like gay people can mock straight

2147
01:35:10,161 --> 01:35:11,630
people guide,
go ahead.

2148
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:13,280
Mock me for like composer,
who cares?

2149
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:14,630
That's what I mean.
Cause we don't,

2150
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:17,570
we've never had to pay a price for that
kind of oppression.

2151
01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:20,000
We haven't,
not physically and not,

2152
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:24,170
not economically because we've been
oppressed for being straight forever.

2153
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:27,840
It's a constant thing.
People were just so mad that we're not

2154
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:31,460
saying read or fucking breeder out there
making babies.

2155
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:34,970
Exactly what's fucking auto.
And George had a great line,

2156
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,220
you know,
auto and George,

2157
01:35:37,221 --> 01:35:40,460
if you don't know,
Otto was this fucking great,

2158
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:44,570
hilarious comedian who had a puppet
named George and his Papa was evil and

2159
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:48,490
these bushy eyebrows and the puppet
would say these fucked up things and

2160
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,520
auto would go,
ah,

2161
01:35:49,521 --> 01:35:50,990
I can't believe you're saying that.

2162
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:53,510
Like what the Hell Creek?
And the puppet would say,

2163
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,141
he goes,
Hey,

2164
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:57,410
I don't understand where all these
fucking queer as it coming from for a

2165
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:01,010
group of people that can't breed,
where the fuck are they all coming from?

2166
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,260
It's like you had these like who'd say
like purposely ignorant shit as his

2167
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,100
puppet.
Yeah.

2168
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:09,980
Well you know,
a lot of times all of us think

2169
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,490
outrageous thoughts.
We think prejudice thoughts.

2170
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:18,970
It's part of being a human being man is
a friend of mine who was dealing with

2171
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,340
um,
these folks that are Jewish that are

2172
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:25,880
incredibly cheap.
And this friend of mine was saying like,

2173
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:31,030
how fucking embarrassing is it when
someone just reenact the most disgusting

2174
01:36:32,751 --> 01:36:35,660
stereotype about a race,
like a Chinese guy,

2175
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:38,480
he just closes his eyes and just drive
straight into traffic.

2176
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,350
Like this is fucking horrible
stereotypes that like when you see them,

2177
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:45,651
like,
oh,

2178
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:47,930
come on man.
If I was Chinese and I saw someone

2179
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:48,830
driving like that,
I'd be like,

2180
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:52,190
you motherfucker.
You know what I'm dealing with here?

2181
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,860
Just being shy.
If there's an accident and I'm involved,

2182
01:36:54,861 --> 01:36:55,461
people go,
oh,

2183
01:36:55,461 --> 01:36:58,310
of course the black and Asian guy go car
accident.

2184
01:36:58,340 --> 01:36:59,000
Well,
do you know,

2185
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,370
do you know what Dunbar's principle is?
Yes.

2186
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:02,600
Yeah,
and that's,

2187
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,840
we have a limited number of people we
can keep within our heads.

2188
01:37:05,841 --> 01:37:06,560
Right?
Right.

2189
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,320
But that also plays a part and
stereotyping.

2190
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,560
There's a limited amount of information
that we can kind of like keeping our

2191
01:37:12,561 --> 01:37:16,040
heads right.
So actually stereotyping was something

2192
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:18,800
that kept us safe.
You're talking about when you talk about

2193
01:37:18,801 --> 01:37:20,750
stereotyping,
what you're really talking about is

2194
01:37:20,751 --> 01:37:22,910
pattern recognition and chunking
information,

2195
01:37:22,911 --> 01:37:24,890
right?
You're looking at something because you

2196
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:25,790
don't have a lot of time.

2197
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:27,560
You're looking at a dude.
It's like Dove,

2198
01:37:27,561 --> 01:37:29,420
David [inaudible] joke about,
you know,

2199
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:32,600
he said he was sitting there and he and
this guy walked up to him,

2200
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:34,100
he's already done this joke so I'm not
selling,

2201
01:37:34,101 --> 01:37:35,420
I'm not,
I'm not ruining it.

2202
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,530
But he said,
you know,

2203
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,720
look,
we assume things all the time.

2204
01:37:38,721 --> 01:37:39,471
You know,
he goes,

2205
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:42,620
I saw this guy with teardrop tattoos,
he had a knife and I was like,

2206
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:44,240
I don't want to stay.
I don't want us to hang around here.

2207
01:37:44,241 --> 01:37:46,130
And the girl goes,
don't assume it could be a chef.

2208
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:48,590
I'm like that's fine.
He could be a chef.

2209
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:52,100
But if you'll pull your pants down and
you've got a bunch of blisters and your

2210
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:53,870
genitals,
I'm not going to assume you got stung by

2211
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:55,290
a pack of bees.
You know,

2212
01:37:55,291 --> 01:37:56,870
at the end of the day you do
stereotyped,

2213
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,360
you make choices based on how you,
you know,

2214
01:37:59,361 --> 01:38:02,760
what the information you get and you do
it very quickly because sometimes that

2215
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:04,050
information and keep you safe.

2216
01:38:04,290 --> 01:38:06,870
A cop.
A lot of times when they see they can

2217
01:38:06,871 --> 01:38:09,690
tell if somebody shouldn't be somewhere
cause they'll look for certain things

2218
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:12,420
out of state plates,
fast food wrappers,

2219
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:15,030
that person's drive and they're on their
way somewhere.

2220
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:19,620
There are lots of different little
signals that cause you to profile,

2221
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,630
right?
Cause sometimes profiling is what's

2222
01:38:21,631 --> 01:38:23,500
called good police work.
Uh,

2223
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,260
we all do it.
We all,

2224
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,990
we all,
when I'm driving and I see a dude in his

2225
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:31,590
car and I see the back of his head,
I can make a lot of fucking assumptions

2226
01:38:31,710 --> 01:38:34,990
on how he's driving and whether or not
he's going to signal like an old dude

2227
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:38,180
with a hat do it all the time.
I do it all the time and I got to speak

2228
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:40,740
by this guy.
I got a beep my horn before I go by

2229
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,660
cause he might just swerving cause he's
a fucking dummy.

2230
01:38:42,870 --> 01:38:46,410
You know what I'm saying?
So some of this is just being a human

2231
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:47,250
being.
And again,

2232
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:52,550
it's how our minds work and we probably
all share very similar thought patterns

2233
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,380
with even our enemies or even the people
we don't like.

2234
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,570
Right.
But being like,

2235
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,640
being a Jewish person,
it's really cheap.

2236
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:06,090
Like super cheap.
But that comes from that's different.

2237
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,760
No,
because that's characteristic.

2238
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:11,550
The way I would look at it as this.
So I'd say you'd say a Jew,

2239
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,750
that Jewish person,
that's cheap.

2240
01:39:12,751 --> 01:39:14,690
Right.
And I would say what I would look at is

2241
01:39:14,691 --> 01:39:15,780
I'd say,
well,

2242
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:18,900
hold on for a second.
If you've been a Jew,

2243
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:21,930
you have a history and we can go back
3,500 years,

2244
01:39:21,931 --> 01:39:23,220
but let's just go back.
Uh,

2245
01:39:23,250 --> 01:39:24,540
I dunno,
let's go back 2000 years.

2246
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:28,320
You got a history of a lot of people in
their twenties.

2247
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,040
Nope.
It doesn't matter.

2248
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,780
Listen,
do you got a lot of people blaming the

2249
01:39:30,781 --> 01:39:32,310
Jews for killing Christ?
Right?

2250
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:35,370
And so usually if you look at history,
especially European history,

2251
01:39:35,371 --> 01:39:37,740
they were either kicked out or they were
killed.

2252
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:39,900
So what happens is if you don't have a
homeland,

2253
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,700
you don't have a homeland and you're a
Jew.

2254
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,890
All right?
Don't they have a homeland?

2255
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,930
No luck yet.
But that's very recent.

2256
01:39:45,931 --> 01:39:48,540
What does that 1948 yeah.
So,

2257
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,630
so as a Jew,
when you actually don't have,

2258
01:39:51,810 --> 01:39:52,920
you know,
a country,

2259
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,701
I'm just,
you know,

2260
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:56,430
as an example,
guess what your security is.

2261
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:59,310
Your fucking security at the end of the
day is how thick your wallet is.

2262
01:39:59,311 --> 01:40:02,250
Because money,
money is how you survived.

2263
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:05,550
You know the reason that a lot of Jews,
the reason Jews were into the jewelry

2264
01:40:05,551 --> 01:40:08,220
trade diamonds,
little diamonds or something you could

2265
01:40:08,221 --> 01:40:10,890
pick up,
put an a pouch and run the fuck away

2266
01:40:10,980 --> 01:40:11,813
really quickly.

2267
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,310
You could transport your wealth.
So they were like,

2268
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:15,300
well,
we're kept out of banking.

2269
01:40:15,301 --> 01:40:16,260
We kept that,
all of these things,

2270
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:20,850
but we can make clothing and we can,
and we're jewelers and they came to this

2271
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:22,410
country.
Those immigrants came to this country

2272
01:40:22,411 --> 01:40:24,660
with those two skills,
Irish came to this country with,

2273
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:25,890
hey,
I got two hands.

2274
01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:28,080
I can work a farm.
What do you need me to do?

2275
01:40:28,230 --> 01:40:29,830
The Jews were like,
I,

2276
01:40:29,831 --> 01:40:32,250
uh,
I can make fucking really nice clothes

2277
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:35,370
and I can label them and I can get you
to think that they're even nicer.

2278
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,470
Because I understand a little bit about
marketing.

2279
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:38,430
Oh.
And by the way,

2280
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:40,180
I got diamonds,
they there,

2281
01:40:40,181 --> 01:40:42,420
there were,
there were certain things that they were

2282
01:40:42,421 --> 01:40:45,090
forced into and they came to this
country and they had a skill set.

2283
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:47,280
So I look at that and I go,
Ooh,

2284
01:40:47,281 --> 01:40:50,080
that's just cultural residue.
That's just cultural residential

2285
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:53,500
culture.
You were taught that that's how you get

2286
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:54,190
ahead

2287
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,370
and you were taught that keeping hold on
your money is by the way also a way to

2288
01:40:57,371 --> 01:41:00,220
ensure your survival.
So the more you learn about,

2289
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:02,080
you know,
the more you learn about people's

2290
01:41:02,081 --> 01:41:04,930
history and the more you learn about our
biology,

2291
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:09,430
the more we learn about brain science.
I think the more compassionate and makes

2292
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:11,620
us,
well that's also why a lot of people

2293
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:15,010
feel that some Asian folks are bad
drivers cause they used to mind their

2294
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:18,130
own business not looking left and right.
And when they walk they walk straight

2295
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:20,050
ahead and they bumped into each other
all the time.

2296
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:21,700
That's great.
That's fucking great.

2297
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:25,180
That's what we will do.
A friend of mine is China was explaining

2298
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:26,170
this to me.
He's like,

2299
01:41:26,171 --> 01:41:28,300
if you go to China and you walked down
the street,

2300
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:30,220
he goes,
people just bounce off each other like

2301
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:31,840
cars.
And he goes,

2302
01:41:31,841 --> 01:41:32,800
and it's not offensive.

2303
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:34,450
It's just what they're doing.
They're not doing it on purpose.

2304
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:36,610
It's just like when you're dealing with
billions of people,

2305
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,040
like this is how you do it.
Yeah.

2306
01:41:38,041 --> 01:41:39,640
You just,
you to just got to plow forward.

2307
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,950
If you ever seen intersections in China,
yes,

2308
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:45,570
you've seen videos of intersections is
fucking terrified.

2309
01:41:45,590 --> 01:41:48,040
It's insanity.
It's fucking terrifying chaos.

2310
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:50,110
It's the aunts.
It's like it was terrifying.

2311
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:52,480
It allows the,
they drive like fucking savages in

2312
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:53,050
Italy.
Yeah.

2313
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:55,170
I mean there's this roundabouts,
well walking,

2314
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:58,390
we're driving into the roundabout what
it called Jesus and the driver just like

2315
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:00,370
skillfully maneuvers around this,
but like,

2316
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:03,910
look at this,
look at this fucking mad bays.

2317
01:42:04,740 --> 01:42:06,490
But they figure it out.
Work they left,

2318
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:08,740
they write,
they zoom around each other.

2319
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,990
They're driving slowly and they're all
making their own.

2320
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:13,690
So at 25 miles an hour,
they say anything below 25 miles an

2321
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:13,780
hour.

2322
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:15,640
Human beings are very good at
navigating.

2323
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:17,560
You know,
that's a good example.

2324
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:19,690
And this is kind of a weird overhead
view,

2325
01:42:20,050 --> 01:42:23,620
but this is,
this is actually manageable,

2326
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:26,650
but I've seen some shit that just does
look manageable.

2327
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,390
You also see people die in those
intersections.

2328
01:42:28,391 --> 01:42:29,500
Yeah.
Well how about the people that are

2329
01:42:29,501 --> 01:42:32,830
walking,
they just walk across the street and

2330
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,110
pray that people avoid them?
Like,

2331
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,180
Oh,
you get,

2332
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,250
God dammit.
Yeah.

2333
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:44,251
I mean there's a lot of cultures that
have their own little thing that they do

2334
01:42:44,410 --> 01:42:46,990
to sort of deal with the numbers that
they're dealing with.

2335
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:49,720
And you know,
you see that in America to one of the

2336
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:53,320
things that I really like about small
towns when I go to a small,

2337
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:55,240
like I was in Bozeman,
Montana recently,

2338
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:58,120
there's only 35,000 residents,
Bozeman,

2339
01:42:58,121 --> 01:43:00,820
Montana.
It's a great town and everybody drives a

2340
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:03,970
really nice,
everybody's like fucking super chill.

2341
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:05,500
Yeah.
There's not that many people.

2342
01:43:06,170 --> 01:43:08,590
People like real easy going,
let everybody.

2343
01:43:08,591 --> 01:43:12,040
And I realized like,
what will your dealing with in Los

2344
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:13,870
Angeles,
like I felt at the moment I got off the

2345
01:43:13,871 --> 01:43:17,260
plane when I went from Montana to here.
The moment you get here,

2346
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:19,510
you're like,
hey gotta go gotta go cut this guy off.

2347
01:43:19,511 --> 01:43:22,270
Get ahead.
Get ahead of like there's a feeling in

2348
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:25,870
the air.
And they did a study and one of the

2349
01:43:25,871 --> 01:43:30,871
things that they did this study on was
they put up cameras in cities and they

2350
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:34,960
measured the amount of footsteps that
people take.

2351
01:43:35,170 --> 01:43:38,710
Like how quickly they walk.
And then they measured how,

2352
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:40,900
how many syllables people say in a
minute,

2353
01:43:40,930 --> 01:43:43,930
how quickly they talk.
And through those two numbers,

2354
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:49,110
they were able to accurately estimate
how many people lived in that city down

2355
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:50,240
to like a thousand.
God,

2356
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,320
I love that stuff.
Yeah,

2357
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,173
like

2358
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:56,060
a shit load of people.
People walk faster and they talk fast.

2359
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:59,120
If you have less people,
they slow down.

2360
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,140
Well,
Gail Collins,

2361
01:44:00,141 --> 01:44:04,760
who is a connoisseur New York Times says
that right wing and left wing people is,

2362
01:44:04,761 --> 01:44:06,050
she goes,
it's all about space.

2363
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,310
When you're,
uh,

2364
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:09,650
when you're,
you become more of a socialist when you

2365
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:12,380
have to contend with all your neighbors.
So you live in a building and,

2366
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:14,210
and you,
it requires cooperation.

2367
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:17,000
It requires waiting in line.
It requires all these things.

2368
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:21,170
When you live in Bozeman,
Montana and you have all that space,

2369
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:25,910
you can preach self reliance,
you can sort of talk about the value of,

2370
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:27,110
you know,
serenity,

2371
01:44:27,111 --> 01:44:29,060
personal serenity,
self reliance and all that stuff.

2372
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:32,540
So it does play a real factor in your
psychology.

2373
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:33,570
It's like,
yeah,

2374
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:34,490
no,
go ahead.

2375
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:36,230
No,
I was going to say Malcolm Gladwell in

2376
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:37,850
his book,
he said,

2377
01:44:37,870 --> 01:44:38,703
uh,
blend,

2378
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,970
I think it was blink where you
mentioned,

2379
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,850
um,
when people would come to his office and

2380
01:44:43,851 --> 01:44:47,750
if you mentioned Florida raisins and
orange juice,

2381
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,440
people left the room a lot slower.

2382
01:44:51,470 --> 01:44:52,730
Do you know why?
Why?

2383
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,670
Because they thought of old people and
retirement.

2384
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:58,700
Whoa.
And so it played a factor in their gate.

2385
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,340
They left,
they left the fucking all lesson spy

2386
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:06,860
walked down the aisle where they walked
down the hallway more measured because

2387
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:07,581
they,
they,

2388
01:45:07,581 --> 01:45:09,740
you put the idea of an old person in
their brain.

2389
01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:11,840
Well,
that's what I was going to say is this

2390
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:16,841
is where the role of colleges are very
interesting because college is sort of

2391
01:45:17,031 --> 01:45:21,080
throw a monkey wrench into that because
college is take a small town and turn it

2392
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:24,920
very liberal,
which ordinarily would not be that way.

2393
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:27,170
You're dealing with small rural
environments.

2394
01:45:27,171 --> 01:45:31,250
You usually deal with conservative
populations that are Christian and you

2395
01:45:31,251 --> 01:45:33,500
know they're in the fucking,
you know,

2396
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,380
Republicans sort of ideas.
There's also something else about

2397
01:45:36,381 --> 01:45:38,510
liberal towns.
They're little small liberal towns like

2398
01:45:38,511 --> 01:45:39,170
you're talking about.

2399
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:42,410
I don't think they turn them liberal.
What they really do is they take away

2400
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:44,330
any existential threat.
For the most part,

2401
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,660
they make those towns super safe.
There are a lot of rules that would

2402
01:45:47,661 --> 01:45:49,520
penalize anybody,
for example,

2403
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:54,500
young men for misbehaving by punching
each other in the face or imposing their

2404
01:45:54,501 --> 01:45:59,330
aggression on a weaker group of people.
I think that's also what,

2405
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:02,510
how I characterize a liberal,
small academic town.

2406
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:07,720
They are safe for the most part,
safe environments for you to figure the

2407
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:10,630
world out and express yourself.
Do you,

2408
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,000
do you know what I'm saying?
But yeah,

2409
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:14,570
safe or like boulder is a good example.
Exactly.

2410
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:16,340
Yeah.
Bull blood sugar sort of,

2411
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:17,300
you know?
Yeah,

2412
01:46:17,450 --> 01:46:18,430
yeah.
Well it's not,

2413
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:21,560
I wouldn't say low blood sugar because
there's a lot of like fitness going on

2414
01:46:21,561 --> 01:46:22,460
there.
Boulders.

2415
01:46:22,461 --> 01:46:25,970
One of the fittest towns in the world
per capita,

2416
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:29,760
like a lot of people have low body fat.
They're hiking all the time looking

2417
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:33,540
people and they're in a fantastic
environment like as far as like the,

2418
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:35,780
the,
the natural beauty of the land around

2419
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:38,390
them and they take advantage of it.
They're always hiking and biking and

2420
01:46:38,391 --> 01:46:40,160
shit,
but you don't have to worry about things

2421
01:46:40,161 --> 01:46:40,994
like,
you know,

2422
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:46,040
like my friend who grew up in the hood
said that he would,

2423
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:50,130
he knew,
he knew when something was about

2424
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:51,510
to happen and I said,
what do you mean?

2425
01:46:51,511 --> 01:46:54,540
He said,
the air changed and your friends might

2426
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:55,261
be an idiot.
No,

2427
01:46:55,261 --> 01:46:55,591
no,
no.

2428
01:46:55,591 --> 01:46:56,670
He said,
he said he's no,

2429
01:46:56,671 --> 01:46:57,331
he said,
he said,

2430
01:46:57,331 --> 01:47:00,420
because what happens is it all fairness,
a lot of your friends are idiots.

2431
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:00,730
No,
no.

2432
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:01,070
He,
he,

2433
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:04,920
he grew up in the hood and he said he
had a lot of his friends can't guy black

2434
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:06,660
guy hit a lot of his friends killed.
And he said,

2435
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:11,520
what I would notice and everybody would
notice is that when the shoot I was

2436
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:13,830
about to happen or a fight was about the
breakout,

2437
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:17,400
he said there was almost like this,
like whatever it was imagined or not,

2438
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:19,710
there would be this calm before the
storm,

2439
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:22,200
the air would change,
things would settle and then boom,

2440
01:47:22,201 --> 01:47:24,480
something would happen.
And he said everybody felt that.

2441
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:26,580
And he said,
cause we were talking about how my

2442
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:31,170
friend walked through the Savannah with
his wife who grew up in Kenya and his

2443
01:47:31,171 --> 01:47:33,210
wife knew everything about it.

2444
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:34,350
She was like,
don't worry about the lions.

2445
01:47:34,351 --> 01:47:37,140
She knew everything.
She knew animal behavior until she saw

2446
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:41,100
what animal,
what guess hyenas.

2447
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:43,200
Nope people,
nope.

2448
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,060
Monkeys.
Water Buffalo.

2449
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:46,570
Ooh.
And she looked at her husband,

2450
01:47:46,571 --> 01:47:48,180
he said,
climb that tree right fucking now.

2451
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:50,790
And he said,
I knew when she told me to climb the

2452
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:52,110
tree cause there were lions.
And she said,

2453
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:54,000
don't worry,
when she's had climbed the tree,

2454
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:55,920
I climbed that fucking tree because it
was a water buffalo.

2455
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,260
She knew her environment and just like
he,

2456
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:59,970
he would walk through the hood and he
was safe.

2457
01:47:59,971 --> 01:48:01,350
He knew it,
he knew how to navigate,

2458
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:03,360
but he also knew when something was
about to happen.

2459
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:06,060
There's a great Jim shockey show,
Jim shockey's,

2460
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:10,000
this really famous conservationist and
big game hunter from Canada.

2461
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:12,780
Really interesting guy,
but he's got this great show called

2462
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,370
uncharted.
And,

2463
01:48:14,371 --> 01:48:15,930
uh,
it's kind of a hunting show,

2464
01:48:15,931 --> 01:48:16,620
but not really.

2465
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:19,860
It's more of an exploration of culture
because he travels to all these

2466
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:24,861
different countries and he really gets
deeply embedded in their country and in

2467
01:48:25,021 --> 01:48:27,570
their culture.
And it goes to these strange lands in

2468
01:48:27,571 --> 01:48:30,690
the middle of nowhere in Russia and or
in Soviet Union were former.

2469
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:32,010
So,
um,

2470
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:33,250
and uh,
he,

2471
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,880
he spent a lot of time in Africa as
well.

2472
01:48:35,881 --> 01:48:37,890
Like he's done a bunch of shows in
Africa.

2473
01:48:37,891 --> 01:48:38,724
Like,
uh,

2474
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:42,600
they actually brought him in to kill
crocodiles that were killing people in

2475
01:48:42,601 --> 01:48:44,640
this village and the people in the
village,

2476
01:48:44,641 --> 01:48:46,020
man,
it was fucking horrific.

2477
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:48,600
You would you would,
they would go through this village with

2478
01:48:48,601 --> 01:48:50,550
cameras and people would be showing
like,

2479
01:48:50,551 --> 01:48:52,740
this guy's missing an arm.
This guy is missing a leg.

2480
01:48:52,741 --> 01:48:54,450
This guy has a bite taken out of his
head.

2481
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,780
Like everyone,
all these p,

2482
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,800
everyone knew the water down there.

2483
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:01,770
Everybody knew it while they were there,
while they were there filming this,

2484
01:49:01,950 --> 01:49:04,230
a woman got taken away by a crocodile
while.

2485
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:05,450
I mean,
it's just a constant,

2486
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:09,360
God terrifying and they were not scared
of anything.

2487
01:49:09,361 --> 01:49:13,650
Like they were scared of buffaloes.
Those fucking Cape Buffalos Water

2488
01:49:13,650 --> 01:49:15,420
Buffalos they're like these God damn
things.

2489
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:20,070
He's grass eating monsters because they
have to fight lines all the time.

2490
01:49:20,071 --> 01:49:21,720
So they're just there.
They fuck.

2491
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:24,960
And they fight lions off and they're
just jack to the tits.

2492
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:26,700
I mean,
if you look at it and be like,

2493
01:49:26,701 --> 01:49:29,280
what does that thing eating?
It must be eating like steroids and they

2494
01:49:29,281 --> 01:49:31,740
weighed 300 pounds on the fucking
enormous.

2495
01:49:31,741 --> 01:49:33,630
They're enormous.
They're huge.

2496
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:37,020
Lion Lions are the biggest assholes
because they'll eat their balls while

2497
01:49:37,021 --> 01:49:39,030
they're on them.
They take that to go to the ball.

2498
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:40,650
First thing they need is their balls and
their Dick.

2499
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:41,513
Really?
Yup.

2500
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:43,860
Cause they're behind him.
So he got one on your back and then

2501
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:44,694
they're like,
hmm,

2502
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:47,410
I'll go for the ball.
Well it's probably easy to tear a loose.

2503
01:49:47,660 --> 01:49:48,490
Right.
That's good.

2504
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,480
Good Bite.
Good all.

2505
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:53,410
It sucks being a water polo sucks being
aligned to man.

2506
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:56,170
Fuck that.
Running around killing shit with your

2507
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,880
face all day.
That's all you can do.

2508
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,910
You don't have a store.
You know,

2509
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:03,250
nature is fucking fucked.
Fuck.

2510
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:08,020
Human beings have always,
it's been a constant war against nature

2511
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:09,670
actually.
It's always been,

2512
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:13,720
how do you harness nature and changed if
it pretty much every animal that exists,

2513
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:17,830
every animal that exists,
even lions are in a constant war with

2514
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:18,920
other lions.
Constant.

2515
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:22,150
Like their reign of terror is so fucking
insanely brief.

2516
01:50:22,151 --> 01:50:25,750
They've got a couple of years where they
run the pride and then some new line

2517
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,450
comes along and kills them.
Yeah.

2518
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:30,230
Even like great bites them so fucked up
that they have there.

2519
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:32,110
They're forced to leave even great
whites,

2520
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:33,160
great whites.
They played.

2521
01:50:33,161 --> 01:50:35,650
Uh,
they had this guy,

2522
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:37,610
uh,
Paul de gelder did our podcast fighter

2523
01:50:37,611 --> 01:50:38,261
and kid,
and he,

2524
01:50:38,261 --> 01:50:41,050
uh,
he ended up losing his arm and his hand

2525
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:44,410
in his leg to a bull shark in Sydney Bay
in Sydney back.

2526
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:46,430
He goes to punch the sharks.
Sharks are brutal.

2527
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:48,100
Yeah.
He goes to punch the shark and he goes,

2528
01:50:48,130 --> 01:50:50,590
oh,
I don't have a hand left and then almost

2529
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:51,820
died and all that.
But,

2530
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:53,410
um,
he was saying having his arm,

2531
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:55,750
nosy or prestige,
it's amazing prosthesis,

2532
01:50:55,751 --> 01:50:57,970
which can close.
And it was a carbon fiber one,

2533
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,250
I think.
So it's like $90,000.

2534
01:51:00,460 --> 01:51:01,300
Whoa.
And,

2535
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:01,931
uh,
and,

2536
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:04,360
but he was at Australian Navy Seal Jack
Dude,

2537
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:06,190
you know,
like a handsome guy and just,

2538
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:06,791
you know,
there,

2539
01:51:06,791 --> 01:51:08,350
he was lost his arm and leg.

2540
01:51:08,350 --> 01:51:09,183
But,
um,

2541
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:11,740
he was talking about how um,
uh,

2542
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,780
they played,
they had,

2543
01:51:14,010 --> 01:51:15,490
there was an area where at least great
whites,

2544
01:51:15,491 --> 01:51:16,690
I guess,
bull sharks and stuff.

2545
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:21,900
And they played the sound of orchids.
They played the sound of what they make

2546
01:51:23,081 --> 01:51:24,340
when they're hunting.
Oh Geez.

2547
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:29,110
And they said that fucking sharks didn't
come near that area for six months.

2548
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:32,140
They were just like,
say I'm Outta here.

2549
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,740
And then what hunts them us.
We fuck up the orchids.

2550
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:36,491
Yeah.
It's,

2551
01:51:36,491 --> 01:51:37,150
it's,
it's,

2552
01:51:37,150 --> 01:51:39,520
it's a constant battle and it always has
been.

2553
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:41,740
And I always wonder like,
it's that battle.

2554
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:45,040
I mean,
it's sort of necessary.

2555
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:49,810
It seems like with the natural world.
I mean obviously we're striving towards

2556
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:52,090
some higher state of existence.
Everyone is,

2557
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,900
I mean,
I think that's where Buddhist come from

2558
01:51:55,901 --> 01:52:00,100
and meditation comes from and veganism
comes from and that doesn't have a

2559
01:52:00,101 --> 01:52:03,550
central nervous shooter,
Utopian ideologies and all these

2560
01:52:03,551 --> 01:52:08,551
thoughts about what we're trying to do
is whether misguided or not,

2561
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,200
we're,
we're trying to strive towards

2562
01:52:11,201 --> 01:52:11,830
improvement.

2563
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:15,280
And when the,
and that is the state of life and it's

2564
01:52:15,281 --> 01:52:17,410
also the state of nature.
There's,

2565
01:52:17,411 --> 01:52:20,170
there has to be some sort of a balance
of power with,

2566
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:23,410
with animals that are herbivores and
animals that are carnivores.

2567
01:52:23,650 --> 01:52:27,910
Like they're talking about bringing in
cougars on the east coast of the United

2568
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:29,650
States to deal with it because you have
too many deer.

2569
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:30,820
Yeah.
They have too many deer,

2570
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:32,380
you know,
and um,

2571
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:37,410
it's a really fascinating subject
because it's a better idea than bringing

2572
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:39,440
in wolves.
Well,

2573
01:52:39,630 --> 01:52:43,090
they're very hard to,
they tend to be wholesale with their

2574
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:44,830
slaughter.
Not only that,

2575
01:52:44,831 --> 01:52:46,730
they,
a lot of fun killing.

2576
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,070
They liked the fun kill.
Yeah.

2577
01:52:49,071 --> 01:52:51,380
They,
they do what they call surplus hunting.

2578
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,870
That video I showed you where I shot
that deer in London,

2579
01:52:54,010 --> 01:52:56,240
England,
here in London.

2580
01:52:56,290 --> 01:52:59,060
I had an hour and a half an hour outside
of London.

2581
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:00,350
You're hunting in someone's yard.

2582
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:02,120
Well,
my buddy owns this giant.

2583
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:02,841
My buddy,
you know,

2584
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:03,740
he made a lot of money.
He said,

2585
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:04,850
I said,
where's your property?

2586
01:53:04,851 --> 01:53:05,331
And he goes,
well,

2587
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:06,680
can you see down there?
I go,

2588
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:07,881
I look.
He goes,

2589
01:53:07,881 --> 01:53:10,240
and can you look that way?
And basically as far as I looked at it

2590
01:53:10,241 --> 01:53:11,420
was all his,
and he said,

2591
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:16,450
by law he needs to kill 21 deer a year
on his property because the deer are

2592
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:18,880
such a problem,
you know,

2593
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,460
because there are no natural predators.
As another thing they,

2594
01:53:21,490 --> 01:53:24,380
they found out today,
there's an article today,

2595
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,310
there was always these,
um,

2596
01:53:26,390 --> 01:53:30,800
these myths about mountain lions being
loose in England,

2597
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:32,450
in the countryside.
Yeah.

2598
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:36,530
It turns out it's true.
It turns out it came from a zoo that

2599
01:53:36,531 --> 01:53:40,010
just admitted recently that they
released these pumas.

2600
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:41,990
Wow.
They released these fucking mountain

2601
01:53:41,991 --> 01:53:44,630
lions they had in captivity so that
people hit like their,

2602
01:53:44,631 --> 01:53:45,980
you know,
they'd been ridiculed like,

2603
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:48,230
oh,
someone took away a big cat took away my

2604
01:53:48,231 --> 01:53:49,760
sheep was motherfuckers drinking.

2605
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:50,301
No,
they,

2606
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:53,030
they were telling the truth.
These fucking mountain lions were

2607
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:55,760
released in the 1980s.
That's amazing.

2608
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:57,680
The countryside in England.
Damn.

2609
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:59,580
Yeah.
Just fucking crazy.

2610
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:01,790
Yas Iv and all that forest.
Well,

2611
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:03,350
if as long as it,
here it goes,

2612
01:54:03,590 --> 01:54:06,650
the beasts of Dartmore does high saying
dark,

2613
01:54:06,651 --> 01:54:10,550
more mystery solved as zoo admits.
It released pumas into the wild in the

2614
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:12,800
1980s.
So it was one that was one of those

2615
01:54:12,801 --> 01:54:14,870
things.
I think it was on that show monster

2616
01:54:14,871 --> 01:54:18,500
quest where they were trying to puting
Raul's looking at,

2617
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:20,630
oh this amazing man.
They're amazing.

2618
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:21,493
And you know,
my,

2619
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:26,030
my buddy has a 70 pound or 75 pound
German shepherd,

2620
01:54:26,031 --> 01:54:27,500
like a bite train that,
you know,

2621
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:30,830
it's a complete badass dog.
And I was looking at it and if you look

2622
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:33,800
at the size of that thing's headed,
maybe 75 pounds doesn't look like much

2623
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:34,590
good luck fight.

2624
01:54:34,590 --> 01:54:35,423
And that thing off.
I've,

2625
01:54:35,430 --> 01:54:37,160
I've seen that thing hit a sleeve and
it's,

2626
01:54:37,190 --> 01:54:41,570
it's horrific how powerful their
mountain lions get up to what 150 pounds

2627
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,520
they can get bigger than,
than twice that size.

2628
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:45,650
It's rare,
but I'll also,

2629
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:48,920
their cats and cats are just way more
agile.

2630
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:50,600
I've got a great story about mountain
lions.

2631
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:52,410
A friend of mine is a,
um,

2632
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:55,940
a guide,
an elk hunting guide in Colorado and he

2633
01:54:55,941 --> 01:54:59,450
said that they found these tracks of
this mount line.

2634
01:54:59,600 --> 01:55:01,520
They have to kill a certain amount of
mountain lions.

2635
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:05,330
And their property because they have
this gigantic ranch and you know,

2636
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:06,220
they just,
they,

2637
01:55:06,250 --> 01:55:09,590
they have a certain amount of tags that
they have to fill or that they should

2638
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:11,120
feel.
And um,

2639
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,400
so you know,
they try to control the populations of

2640
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:15,260
mountain lions.
So they were trying to find this

2641
01:55:15,261 --> 01:55:16,920
mountain line attracting,
tracking this mountain lion attract

2642
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:17,893
these tracks.

2643
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:22,070
And they saw elk tracks and they saw a
mountain lion tracks and then they saw

2644
01:55:22,071 --> 01:55:24,710
only elk tracks.
Oh.

2645
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:29,270
Because the mountain lion had jumped on
the back of this fucking gigantic 900

2646
01:55:29,271 --> 01:55:34,271
pound bull elk and rode it for 150 yards
and then taking it down.

2647
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:40,580
So this hundred and 50 pound cat,
they wound up killing had killed this,

2648
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,800
you know,
close to a thousand pound l is unreal

2649
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:45,330
man.
But when they found it,

2650
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:49,110
the fucking mountain line was on the elk
and the elk was down and then,

2651
01:55:49,130 --> 01:55:51,420
you know,
they followed the tracks of this elk

2652
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:55,560
running with this cat on its back.
I think just leaped.

2653
01:55:55,561 --> 01:55:58,560
I met,
imagine being something like a person,

2654
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:00,810
you know,
you weigh 170 pounds.

2655
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,500
Yeah.
Like,

2656
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:02,670
like a cat,
a cat toy,

2657
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:03,840
and you just decide,
oh,

2658
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:07,560
I'm going to jump on that thousand pound
horse and kill it with my face.

2659
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:12,360
And their canines have sensors
apparently where they can sense where

2660
01:56:12,361 --> 01:56:13,030
the juggler is.

2661
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:15,390
They keep adjusting their grip.
Oh God.

2662
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:17,610
Good God.
What's nature man?

2663
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:22,640
Nature's just so creepy and it's ways of
adjusting to life.

2664
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:26,140
My friend and dress Antonopoulos,
uh,

2665
01:56:26,141 --> 01:56:26,851
my,
my friend,

2666
01:56:26,851 --> 01:56:28,440
the bitcoin expert,
explain this to me.

2667
01:56:28,441 --> 01:56:33,441
Last weekend in Vegas,
ducks have three foot long dicks that

2668
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:39,801
curl and twist because the,
the female vaginas have adapted to fight

2669
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:44,100
off rape,
duck rape.

2670
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:47,990
So they have these pussies that are the,
these fucking labyrinth,

2671
01:56:47,991 --> 01:56:51,180
this,
these twisty turny a labyrinth,

2672
01:56:51,181 --> 01:56:55,710
pussies.
And they can choose to let sperm in or

2673
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:59,250
not let sperm in with their gigantic
labyrinth,

2674
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:02,490
pussies.
And these three foot long duck dicks,

2675
01:57:02,610 --> 01:57:05,790
when you see a duck's Dick,
you let con that is not real.

2676
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:08,460
Look at that ducks Dick.
That's a drawing.

2677
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,580
That's a drawing.
But there's actual photograph that's an

2678
01:57:11,581 --> 01:57:13,110
actual photograph of a duck.
Dick.

2679
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,260
What in the fuck?
That's like a person,

2680
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:18,330
but like a 15 foot long dick.
Yeah.

2681
01:57:18,450 --> 01:57:22,200
Ducks are tiny man horse to dick.
Like a person with a three foot dick is

2682
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:25,260
a monster.
But a duck with a three foot long dick

2683
01:57:25,261 --> 01:57:27,480
is totally standard as a deck.
That's a limp.

2684
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:30,630
One guy's a little little deck.
He gets shamed by the other ducks.

2685
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:31,890
Poor guy.
Yeah.

2686
01:57:31,891 --> 01:57:33,900
I mean,
duck ducks are ridiculous.

2687
01:57:33,970 --> 01:57:36,300
They're,
it's a fucking ridiculous animal.

2688
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:41,820
I knew the ducks engaged in rape,
gang rape.

2689
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:42,713
Oh,
that's all they do.

2690
01:57:43,110 --> 01:57:45,180
That's the only one that hung up on one.
Look how,

2691
01:57:45,181 --> 01:57:50,181
look how the female's vagina has sort of
adapted to deal with the male raping.

2692
01:57:53,580 --> 01:57:56,400
You know,
created these bizarre pathways in their

2693
01:57:56,401 --> 01:57:57,211
pussies.
Wait,

2694
01:57:57,211 --> 01:57:59,570
when you,
when you listened to Dan Carlin's a

2695
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,130
wrath of the cons are you read history,
you know,

2696
01:58:02,131 --> 01:58:04,560
and it was always,
here we come,

2697
01:58:04,561 --> 01:58:07,180
we're knocking down your walls when
we're selling everybody into slavery.

2698
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,730
History is a,
is a,

2699
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:10,110
is history of rape,
right?

2700
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:12,690
So most women basically we'll,
I got shit.

2701
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:14,400
Laws are coming down.
We're about to,

2702
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,750
our men are going to be killed and we're
going to be,

2703
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:17,970
we're going to be raped.
I mean it's just happened over and over

2704
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:20,070
and over.
I would imagine that most of history is

2705
01:58:20,071 --> 01:58:21,210
a story like that.

2706
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:25,440
And women were basically just forced to
be taken by,

2707
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,180
you know,
either group of men or whatever,

2708
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:29,220
just like most of animal has.
Yeah.

2709
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:30,181
Yeah.
It's really,

2710
01:58:30,181 --> 01:58:31,590
really,
it's just brutal.

2711
01:58:31,591 --> 01:58:33,450
It's really interesting how,
how,

2712
01:58:33,451 --> 01:58:36,170
I guess women had to adapt and evolve
and,

2713
01:58:36,190 --> 01:58:38,550
and,
and this woman wrote an article and I

2714
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:43,480
came her name cause it was pretty
controversial and she said that because

2715
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:45,310
you know,
so much of history,

2716
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:49,570
women had no choice and they were forced
upon by men.

2717
01:58:50,030 --> 01:58:52,030
Uh,
one of two things happen.

2718
01:58:52,031 --> 01:58:56,020
First they had to find the man who was
the most aggressive and strong and who

2719
01:58:56,021 --> 01:59:01,021
could protect them from the other men.
So for women to be attracted to

2720
01:59:01,421 --> 01:59:06,421
aggression and strength is not so
uncommon.

2721
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:12,420
But the other really controversial thing
she said was that there are cases where

2722
01:59:12,911 --> 01:59:16,030
women are turned on by aggressive sex,
you know,

2723
01:59:16,031 --> 01:59:17,470
being held down and all that stuff.

2724
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:22,150
And it's probably the fact that they had
to evolve because otherwise they'd get

2725
01:59:22,151 --> 01:59:24,150
injured if they didn't get lubricated.
You know,

2726
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,781
it's kind of like,
I,

2727
01:59:24,781 --> 01:59:25,511
I read that,
I was like,

2728
01:59:25,511 --> 01:59:26,410
well,
good luck with that.

2729
01:59:26,411 --> 01:59:27,190
But that was,
you know,

2730
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:29,710
she was a female anthropologist.
I can't remember if fucking name,

2731
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,340
but I was like,
well,

2732
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:33,280
only that if can imagine coming out with
that article.

2733
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,720
And,
and that's my,

2734
01:59:34,721 --> 01:59:38,170
this is my thesis for a in anthropology
and amherst college,

2735
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,840
everybody.
And it's a very objective thought

2736
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:41,920
process.
I mean there's,

2737
01:59:41,921 --> 01:59:43,780
there's evolution.
It's just an illusion.

2738
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,180
Well,
it's called evolving,

2739
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:48,310
you know,
in dealing with aggression the way the

2740
01:59:48,311 --> 01:59:51,160
ducks did well,
and also dealing with the natural world

2741
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:53,560
that you find yourself in,
which is just filled with danger and

2742
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:55,900
murder and constant warfare.
I mean,

2743
01:59:55,901 --> 01:59:57,340
that's,
that's what people did.

2744
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:58,090
That's all people do.

2745
01:59:58,090 --> 02:00:00,670
I mean,
there was states of peace interrupted by

2746
02:00:00,671 --> 02:00:04,660
war and it states a piece,
I mean gingiss con kill in his,

2747
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:10,020
his children and his armies killed 10%
of the population of the world during

2748
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:13,630
his lifetime.
There is a New York Times article they

2749
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:18,520
wrote where they were saying that he
altered the carbon footprint of human

2750
02:00:18,521 --> 02:00:22,150
beings on earth,
a measurable altering of the carbon

2751
02:00:22,151 --> 02:00:24,250
footprint because they had killed so
many people.

2752
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:28,660
Like you could measure the difference in
the amount of people that were there

2753
02:00:28,661 --> 02:00:32,290
before him and after him.
By core samples.

2754
02:00:32,291 --> 02:00:33,124
Yeah.
Like,

2755
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:34,211
well,
you know,

2756
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:37,060
I mean Hitler did something similar in
the Russian countryside.

2757
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:41,740
He killed entire villages because he was
trying to clear an area for,

2758
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:44,350
you know,
sort of the migration of the German

2759
02:00:44,351 --> 02:00:46,540
peoples and the idea that,
you know,

2760
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:49,930
let's get rid of these sort of people
that think and talk differently and

2761
02:00:49,931 --> 02:00:51,670
let's create a,
a utopia.

2762
02:00:52,060 --> 02:00:56,260
We'll what gingiss topcon did that was
so fucked up as he did it all before

2763
02:00:56,261 --> 02:00:57,970
there was even guns.
Yeah.

2764
02:00:57,971 --> 02:01:02,110
I mean there's doing bows and arrows.
They killed [inaudible] hand somewhere

2765
02:01:02,111 --> 02:01:06,820
in the neighborhood of 50 to 70 million
people while he was alive.

2766
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:07,840
Well,
he said,

2767
02:01:07,841 --> 02:01:09,220
I think that what he said was really
neat.

2768
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:10,054
I never forgot.
He said there were,

2769
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:15,070
the Romans would create a wasteland and
call it peace and to an extent the,

2770
02:01:16,210 --> 02:01:17,050
you know,
the,

2771
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,510
the con,
the Gaviscon did the same thing.

2772
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:20,531
Well,
not only that,

2773
02:01:20,531 --> 02:01:22,970
what's interesting is how history looks
at them now.

2774
02:01:22,971 --> 02:01:25,930
And that's one of the things that Dan
Carlin was talking about.

2775
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:31,200
Colin was talking about how people tend
to look in the future.

2776
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:34,420
They'll look at,
and he was actually using it in,

2777
02:01:34,421 --> 02:01:35,710
in,
in terms of like,

2778
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:38,950
would people do this with the Nazis that
they would,

2779
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:39,980
when enough

2780
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,780
time has passed,
you can say,

2781
02:01:41,781 --> 02:01:44,330
well,
he cleared the road for trade to the

2782
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:45,164
east.
Yeah,

2783
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:46,090
yeah.
You know,

2784
02:01:46,091 --> 02:01:47,760
what was the,
what was the silver lining in,

2785
02:01:47,761 --> 02:01:49,440
in massive genocide.
Yeah,

2786
02:01:49,540 --> 02:01:50,090
yeah,
yeah.

2787
02:01:50,090 --> 02:01:53,350
And that very controversial,
but of course with everything it would,

2788
02:01:53,430 --> 02:01:55,280
it goes back to exactly what we were
talking about.

2789
02:01:55,281 --> 02:01:58,100
Where,
where when you come up in the ghetto,

2790
02:01:58,101 --> 02:02:01,010
you might just create miles Davis.
I mean there's a lot of heartache and

2791
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:04,290
terrible things and from shit is the
brightest flower,

2792
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:07,310
that kind of stuff.
And once there's enough time passed,

2793
02:02:07,330 --> 02:02:11,720
then you can sort of look at it with
this distance and you can kind of

2794
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:13,160
objectively look at it and go,
well,

2795
02:02:13,161 --> 02:02:14,600
you know,
here's the benefit of that.

2796
02:02:14,601 --> 02:02:17,870
Here's the silver lining.
Where that doesn't really hold up though

2797
02:02:17,871 --> 02:02:22,460
is if you look at where the bulk of
innovation and uh,

2798
02:02:22,580 --> 02:02:26,540
our artistic expression on a high level
came out of it came out of free

2799
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:27,080
societies.

2800
02:02:27,080 --> 02:02:29,360
I mean,
look at what Sparta left behind,

2801
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:32,270
nothing.
And look at what Athens left behind.

2802
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:36,350
Look at Sparta lift behind a deep
history of warriors.

2803
02:02:36,360 --> 02:02:39,530
Mythologize but nothing,
you can really hang your hat on.

2804
02:02:39,531 --> 02:02:41,330
Another words,
story and,

2805
02:02:41,331 --> 02:02:45,170
and I talk about hardship and separating
the child from his mother and all that

2806
02:02:45,171 --> 02:02:46,910
stuff.
But you're Ron Butler,

2807
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:50,600
300 and kicking people into wells.
But yes,

2808
02:02:50,601 --> 02:02:51,050
it,
it,

2809
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:52,550
it's,
there's a,

2810
02:02:52,551 --> 02:02:55,160
there's a mythology that,
a warrior ethos that you can,

2811
02:02:55,161 --> 02:02:55,731
you know,
kind of,

2812
02:02:55,731 --> 02:02:56,660
I'm a spartan,
but,

2813
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,590
but Athens,
the Acropolis and the writings of all

2814
02:03:00,591 --> 02:03:03,440
the bug cracking and philosophy,
the butt fucking,

2815
02:03:03,680 --> 02:03:06,340
uh,
the idea of demos that democracy at

2816
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:07,223
Demos,
the people,

2817
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:11,390
these are,
these are ideas that still live on and

2818
02:03:11,391 --> 02:03:13,010
were built upon.
You know,

2819
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:13,820
uh,
look at,

2820
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:16,850
look at in today's world,
the amount of innovation that's coming

2821
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:21,851
out of a peaceful society and a society
that respects other peoples' ideas and a

2822
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:24,590
society that for the most part,
um,

2823
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:29,620
at least from a historical perspective,
gives a great deal of freedom and a

2824
02:03:29,660 --> 02:03:32,720
benefit to those that have the guts to
come up with their own ideas.

2825
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:34,820
Well,
that's the interesting aspect about what

2826
02:03:34,821 --> 02:03:39,821
the United States is as this experiment
in self government and what it is,

2827
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:43,940
what it started off as.
What it is currently is that this is the

2828
02:03:43,941 --> 02:03:48,560
most recent of countries.
And it's also the one that has

2829
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:52,580
overwhelmingly the most innovation,
the most artistic,

2830
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:54,980
uh,
the contributions,

2831
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:57,510
the pioneers.
There's so much that comes out of here.

2832
02:03:57,530 --> 02:04:00,590
So,
in terms of comedy film,

2833
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:03,360
I mean obviously the rest of the world
has its contributions.

2834
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:05,390
I'm not saying that United States is the
best.

2835
02:04:05,391 --> 02:04:08,600
I mean the Beatles came out of England.
There's a lot of amazing works of art

2836
02:04:08,601 --> 02:04:13,601
that come out of all over the world.
But this country is a hotbed of artistic

2837
02:04:13,761 --> 02:04:18,230
expression by far,
by far and away the biggest,

2838
02:04:18,380 --> 02:04:22,400
and it's the most recent now,
the oldest country that we know of,

2839
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:24,710
the cradle of civilization is the Middle
East,

2840
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:25,920
Iraq,
and that,

2841
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:27,530
those are the townies of the world.

2842
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:30,140
This is,
this is the thought that I've been

2843
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:32,990
bounced around for a long time.
Like this is the reason why those places

2844
02:04:32,991 --> 02:04:36,740
are so fucked up is cause there's the
echoes of savages.

2845
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:40,530
The echoes of these ancient people are
still in this area.

2846
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:42,570
It's so difficult.
Like you got to get out of the fucking

2847
02:04:42,571 --> 02:04:43,404
town,
man.

2848
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:46,710
You got to leave the town.
Well was he the great tragedy is that

2849
02:04:46,770 --> 02:04:47,131
the,
you know,

2850
02:04:47,131 --> 02:04:49,680
and they've done a lot of studies on why
do some nations,

2851
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:53,100
why does some nations fail and why does
some nations,

2852
02:04:53,380 --> 02:04:54,810
uh,
become prosperous?

2853
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:58,110
And you can break it down into a number
of things.

2854
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:01,410
You can see the problem with the Middle
East for a thousand reasons.

2855
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:01,981
We can,
again,

2856
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:04,960
two and a lot of it was just a foreign
invasion and,

2857
02:05:04,961 --> 02:05:06,690
and foreign meddling and stuff like
that.

2858
02:05:06,691 --> 02:05:08,670
But how about getting his con yes.

2859
02:05:08,670 --> 02:05:10,860
I mean,
did what he did to bag that in 1260,

2860
02:05:10,861 --> 02:05:13,350
you know,
they say that to this day Baghdad maybe

2861
02:05:13,351 --> 02:05:16,680
still hasn't recovered from them
invading and killed.

2862
02:05:16,830 --> 02:05:21,830
They said that the rivers ran red with
blood and ink black ink,

2863
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:25,290
like all the amazing works,
like viber is burned and everything

2864
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:29,340
Islamic scholars throughout history were
like innovators.

2865
02:05:29,341 --> 02:05:33,530
They were like the huge contributions
math philosophy course.

2866
02:05:34,170 --> 02:05:34,781
And,
and,

2867
02:05:34,781 --> 02:05:37,980
and there are a lot of people say that
the Middle East has never even

2868
02:05:37,981 --> 02:05:40,170
recovered,
has never quite recovered from that.

2869
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:43,410
But you know,
there are so many important things for

2870
02:05:43,411 --> 02:05:44,790
why a nation,
you know,

2871
02:05:44,820 --> 02:05:48,270
for example,
one is that your political parties that

2872
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:53,271
lose live to see another day.
That is very important when you lose an

2873
02:05:54,361 --> 02:05:57,390
election and a lot of countries like the
hard liners,

2874
02:05:57,391 --> 02:05:58,710
and somebody said to me,
I said,

2875
02:05:58,711 --> 02:06:00,480
why are the hard liners in Iran such a
pain in the ass?

2876
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:01,920
He goes,
because if they lose,

2877
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:05,130
they will die.
That's a very important thing to keep in

2878
02:06:05,131 --> 02:06:08,160
mind.
So when you have power and your survival

2879
02:06:08,161 --> 02:06:11,430
depends on holding onto power,
you're going to have a secret police

2880
02:06:11,431 --> 02:06:15,030
that basically it's pretty brutal when
when they sniff any kind of

2881
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:17,490
insurrection.
This country is pretty amazing.

2882
02:06:17,491 --> 02:06:20,940
What's so unique about the United States
is after the revolutionary war,

2883
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:25,110
after every revolutionary war,
the country always breaks into civil war

2884
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,840
always.
And the founding fathers had incredible

2885
02:06:27,841 --> 02:06:32,841
restraint and wisdom to,
to allow the election after that war to

2886
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:37,050
go as it would,
they didn't resort to violence.

2887
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:42,140
That's so unique in history,
but our country and the UK and Australia

2888
02:06:42,301 --> 02:06:46,800
and Canada and a couple other countries
when you lose is that democracy is built

2889
02:06:46,801 --> 02:06:48,840
on the idea that when your political
party loses you,

2890
02:06:48,841 --> 02:06:53,130
you lived to see another day and fight
on very important.

2891
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:56,640
The other is property rights.
You'll need property rights.

2892
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:59,580
The other is courts.
That means something and the other is

2893
02:06:59,581 --> 02:07:02,370
the scientific method.
You have to embrace the scientific

2894
02:07:02,371 --> 02:07:05,850
method.
A society has to say that it's not about

2895
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:08,130
superstition.
This is not a theology.

2896
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:11,310
Let's,
let's base reality on what you can

2897
02:07:11,311 --> 02:07:15,540
measure and what you can see that those
things are so fucking important.

2898
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:20,250
If you don't have those,
those central principles as a through

2899
02:07:20,251 --> 02:07:22,710
line,
if that's not the scaffolding of your

2900
02:07:22,711 --> 02:07:25,170
society,
you're not going to do,

2901
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:28,440
you're just not going to do as well as a
country like the United States.

2902
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:31,860
You're not going to have people that
innovate because there's no fucking

2903
02:07:31,861 --> 02:07:33,510
incentive.
There's no incentive in it.

2904
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:36,190
You're not going to benefit from it.
You could get it stolen

2905
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:40,030
or you could be killed because you think
differently or all those things will

2906
02:07:40,031 --> 02:07:41,790
also,
you're not safe enough to innovate.

2907
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:44,170
Yeah.
You don't have the ability to express

2908
02:07:44,171 --> 02:07:46,090
yourself.
You don't have the ability to take

2909
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:47,050
chances.
Yeah.

2910
02:07:47,051 --> 02:07:49,060
So the irony,
the ironic thing is when you're

2911
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:52,930
sensitive and nice to people,
when you're empathetic and when you're

2912
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:55,720
respectful of other people,
even the ones you don't have this you

2913
02:07:55,721 --> 02:07:59,140
disagree with,
you make a stronger society.

2914
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:03,160
The society is stronger in every way,
including militarily,

2915
02:08:03,370 --> 02:08:05,570
including you have more innovation with
militant,

2916
02:08:05,571 --> 02:08:06,070
with,
with,

2917
02:08:06,070 --> 02:08:07,840
with weaponry.
And on that note,

2918
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:08,800
God,
I'm smart guys.

2919
02:08:08,801 --> 02:08:10,660
Did you write that shit down?
Amazing.

2920
02:08:10,661 --> 02:08:12,400
You want to hear more?
You have your own podcast.

2921
02:08:12,401 --> 02:08:13,840
I got more out unpack.
And by the way,

2922
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:16,360
I'm taking that podcast and the road
with a guy named Brendan Schaub.

2923
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:17,500
Oh,
that's a different podcast.

2924
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,161
Oh No,
this is,

2925
02:08:18,161 --> 02:08:18,550
yeah.

2926
02:08:18,550 --> 02:08:20,030
Yeah.
But let's talk about the fight and the

2927
02:08:20,031 --> 02:08:22,150
kid for a second.
Cause Brennan Brennan will beat me up if

2928
02:08:22,151 --> 02:08:25,360
I don't talk about this.
July 29th July till he hits me,

2929
02:08:25,361 --> 02:08:27,070
he strikes me with an open hand.
Ah,

2930
02:08:27,230 --> 02:08:29,080
he pulls my pants down and spanks me and
you know,

2931
02:08:29,081 --> 02:08:30,640
he could and I couldn't do anything
about it.

2932
02:08:30,910 --> 02:08:33,160
And I've tried.
I've tried to find him and it bothers me

2933
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:36,010
cause sometimes I get jumpy with them.
I get jumpy and I'll get under hooks on

2934
02:08:36,011 --> 02:08:37,090
them.
And a giant,

2935
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:37,481
no,
no,

2936
02:08:37,481 --> 02:08:37,841
no,
he's,

2937
02:08:37,841 --> 02:08:38,900
he's weird.
He's weird.

2938
02:08:38,901 --> 02:08:40,840
Shiny.
He I tried,

2939
02:08:40,841 --> 02:08:43,570
I said kind of tiny dude.
Don't use that word.

2940
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:44,870
Just say medium.
All right.

2941
02:08:44,920 --> 02:08:46,480
Just say me kind of medium,
I guess.

2942
02:08:46,510 --> 02:08:47,620
I said the other day,
I said,

2943
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:51,580
I don't believe you could.
I don't believe if we were to go take

2944
02:08:51,581 --> 02:08:53,830
them for a take down.
And I tried to do a little upper body

2945
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:54,664
Greco with them.

2946
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:56,830
Yeah.
And it didn't go well and I got so

2947
02:08:56,831 --> 02:09:00,160
flustered and hurt Mike actually tweak
my neck that I left my wallet and my

2948
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:02,200
phone on my fucking car.
I let him,

2949
02:09:02,201 --> 02:09:05,380
he drove off Brendan's brother drive my
car and I yeah.

2950
02:09:05,381 --> 02:09:06,360
And Smash your phone.
Yeah.

2951
02:09:06,770 --> 02:09:07,660
Uh,
yeah.

2952
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,370
I have blue been talking about that
recently,

2953
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:14,371
that I think that people have a massive
owes overestimation massive of what they

2954
02:09:14,651 --> 02:09:17,020
can and can't do with their body.
And it's we,

2955
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:18,730
we,
we hang around for any shop,

2956
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,610
hang around,
Brennan Shop,

2957
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,480
forget bearing to shop.
We played this video of these people

2958
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:27,481
that put on these gigantic balloon suits
and let bowls hit them.

2959
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:29,320
What?
You haven't seen this?

2960
02:09:29,560 --> 02:09:30,610
Well,
we'll end on this.

2961
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:33,700
It's fucking insane that these people,
I want to say this,

2962
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:37,210
but I think people have this idea in
their head that all the bolts come in.

2963
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:39,610
I'm going to be fine.
I just fucking get out of the way.

2964
02:09:39,800 --> 02:09:42,850
You don't realize like they have,
they massively overestimate what they

2965
02:09:42,851 --> 02:09:44,920
can and can't do with their body,
how they move their body.

2966
02:09:44,921 --> 02:09:46,120
I got to see this,
by the way,

2967
02:09:46,150 --> 02:09:50,470
while we're watching this,
July 29th 30th Phoenix stand up live.

2968
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:52,300
We're there.
We still have some tickets left.

2969
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:56,140
Live fighter and the kid podcast show.
It's a show.

2970
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:59,650
Me and Brendan Schaub Brennan shall be
doing new standup.

2971
02:09:59,860 --> 02:10:03,040
I'm very excited to watch this.
So these assholes look at this.

2972
02:10:03,070 --> 02:10:03,903
No.
Yeah,

2973
02:10:04,230 --> 02:10:06,880
the legs like say goodbye to your acl.
Look at this,

2974
02:10:06,881 --> 02:10:08,740
watch this.
Boom,

2975
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:11,410
boom.
Oh leak.

2976
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:13,240
I mean,
these are massive,

2977
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:15,670
massive animals.
Bulls are so mean.

2978
02:10:15,671 --> 02:10:18,430
And meanwhile they just eat grass.
He looks like he's not hurt.

2979
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:20,390
I wonder if bulls,
it'd be nicer if they had a stake

2980
02:10:21,960 --> 02:10:22,900
wait for it.
Yeah,

2981
02:10:22,901 --> 02:10:23,860
because he gets worse.

2982
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:25,240
Like this guy,
he's like,

2983
02:10:25,270 --> 02:10:27,410
oh Jeez man,
this is good.

2984
02:10:28,180 --> 02:10:30,130
This is just,
just started.

2985
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,600
Meanwhile,
people are laughing.

2986
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:33,620
This is what people in rural
environments do.

2987
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:37,570
They laugh,
they low my hands and I would never do

2988
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:42,630
that fucking hair.
That guy got the air.

2989
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:45,700
That gentleman got Lord.
Yeah.

2990
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:47,870
That guy is fuck.
And he hit him again while he's out

2991
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:50,900
cold.
I mean that dude flew through the air

2992
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:52,580
flu.
Oh,

2993
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:54,230
what about your legs,
Bro?

2994
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,290
One more time.
Exactly.

2995
02:10:57,320 --> 02:10:58,580
Well,
it seems like that bowl doesn't have

2996
02:10:58,581 --> 02:11:00,670
horns.
They probably saw good morning God,

2997
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:02,490
but whatever.
That's not saving anything.

2998
02:11:02,570 --> 02:11:04,580
I might have to do that,
but I don't have the gun.

2999
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:05,450
No,
you shouldn't do that.

3000
02:11:05,451 --> 02:11:06,410
Well,
there's other ones.

3001
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:09,110
This is one that we looked at.
They've figured out a way to do it

3002
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:09,944
better.
Okay.

3003
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:14,000
And the better one is a much larger ball
where you're completely encase,

3004
02:11:14,110 --> 02:11:15,570
then you're late.

3005
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:19,460
You can't have it from you fucking waste
down because your legs are like super

3006
02:11:19,461 --> 02:11:24,461
flexible or a super weak.
My knees getting broken by a bull's head

3007
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:28,790
and they will get Brogan bios.
So you would find the one,

3008
02:11:28,791 --> 02:11:29,624
yeah,
you've got the other one.

3009
02:11:29,780 --> 02:11:30,650
There's no,
you don't.

3010
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:31,820
Okay.
Well there's,

3011
02:11:31,821 --> 02:11:34,100
there's other videos of them doing it
where they figure,

3012
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:34,920
well,
this is,

3013
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:38,290
is not safe enough.
We've got to get a much larger bottom.

3014
02:11:38,350 --> 02:11:40,160
It's much harder to hear the people in
the audience.

3015
02:11:40,161 --> 02:11:42,700
That's what happens when you get a bunch
of farmers and they're drunk and they

3016
02:11:42,710 --> 02:11:44,390
just want to fucking each other.
Yeah.

3017
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:45,470
On the snake tip.
Well,

3018
02:11:45,471 --> 02:11:48,590
I don't know if they keep fucking each
other like crazy.

3019
02:11:48,591 --> 02:11:51,170
Those people,
there's no one around just like fucking

3020
02:11:51,171 --> 02:11:53,520
30 people in the town.
They're all fucking each other's wives.

3021
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:55,370
Course snaking around.
Hey,

3022
02:11:55,570 --> 02:11:57,530
I don't think your husband's a true
Christian,

3023
02:11:57,770 --> 02:11:58,170
you know?

3024
02:11:58,170 --> 02:12:00,020
Uh,
I just see the way he talks to you and

3025
02:12:00,021 --> 02:12:02,120
just makes me feel terrible about it.
Oh,

3026
02:12:02,121 --> 02:12:04,620
I don't feel,
can you feel my mic mixing?

3027
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:07,900
No.
Are you a Muslim kids got red fire?

3028
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:08,843
No,
that's come.

3029
02:12:08,990 --> 02:12:09,870
Oh God.
I don't know.

3030
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:11,900
That's so much comments like that noise
when I come,

3031
02:12:11,901 --> 02:12:13,460
I just go out of cow.
I'm like,

3032
02:12:13,461 --> 02:12:15,860
you're welcome.
This is for you.

3033
02:12:15,890 --> 02:12:18,750
You've earned it.
Ah,

3034
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:22,790
foreign income at the same time.
My nectar.

3035
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:23,863
Yeah.
Okay.

3036
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:24,681
All right.
Good night.

3037
02:12:24,681 --> 02:12:27,100
Everybody is Phoenix Life.
Oh yeah.

3038
02:12:27,101 --> 02:12:29,090

02:12:30,681 --> 02:12:34,100
Y a n count is probably some asshole
pretending to be Brian.

3042
02:12:34,101 --> 02:12:36,060
That's b.
R.

3043

Yeah.
Fourth and fifth is going to be great.

3048

August 4th and fifth wheels leverage
programs opening for me.

3049
