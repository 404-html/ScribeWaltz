1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,661
Doo doo,
Doo,

2
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:01,410
Doo Doo,
Doo Doo.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,000
You know,
just being on tinder the whole time.

4
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,350
We're live.
We're live.

5
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,230
You can't talk about tinder dudes.
She can shot it off.

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,240
Don't swipe right.
Steve Hofstetter.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,750
Ladies and gentlemen already ready.
That was at the same time.

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,060
I'm good.
I'm excited to be here.

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,170
I'm excited to have you,
man.

10
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,080
I'd love the video.
There's a video I found out about Steve

11
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:22,680
because it's a video of some fucking
hecklers.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,560
Why do they still exist?
The people out there.

13
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:27,810
Do you not know that when you come to a
comedy show,

14
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:31,320
it's like going to the movies.
You shouldn't try to contact ego and

15
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,160
alcohol.
You're right.

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,930
That's the answer.
I asked.

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,700
Asked a rhetorical question
and I got a definitive answer.

18
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,360
It's a fucking great video though
because you handled it so well.

19
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,650
I don't remember the subject.
What was.

20
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,320
What was she a heckling about?

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,600
It was about.
I was talking about how parents think

22
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,240
they're special and they're not.
That's right,

23
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,510
and then she yelled out bullshit and
then walked into two minutes of material

24
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,160
that I already had written about the
subject.

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,830
If I had written what she was supposed
to say,

26
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,780
it wouldn't have been as good as what
she actually said.

27
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,120
Yeah.
It was like a setup and sometimes those

28
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,240
things happen and people accused people
doing plants.

29
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,000
I've never heard of anybody actually
doing a plant though.

30
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,160
You other than Andy Kaufman.
No,

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,470
like not even.
Not one time,

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,500
but people.
Some Times people look at the world and

33
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,011
they go,
well,

34
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:18,390
this is too good.
It can't be real.

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,110
Sleep will allow for some magic that
happens sometimes.

36
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,450
A little comedy magic.
Yeah.

37
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,670
I mean there's so many videos of
hecklers.

38
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:29,250
You would think that they would learn
like there's.

39
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,430
Is there a video of a heckler winning?
I mean,

40
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,020
there,
there are definitely videos of people

41
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,640
who are like,
I own this heckler.

42
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:37,260
And then like,
did you,

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,120
did you looks Kinda.
No,

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,150
not really sometimes,
but that's not the heckler winning.

45
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:43,690
That's the comedian losing,
right?

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,940
There's,
there's a difference.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,380
You know,
the end there are,

48
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,570
um,
there are times I think when they're

49
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,540
comedians,
you know this,

50
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:55,590
they're comedians who can't ad Lib,
who are brilliant at material but are

51
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,450
just not add libbers.
If that's weird,

52
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,700
isn't it,
like the people that only want to do

53
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,370
like monologues and if anything goes
offline,

54
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,930
like they ignore it and they just keep
going and they hope that someone takes

55
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:08,130
care of it.
Well,

56
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:09,900
I don't,
I don't understand that like that.

57
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:11,760
That's part of people sometimes will be
like,

58
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,960
why do you have so many heckler videos?

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,790
It's like,
because most of them start with me

60
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:15,624
going,
what'd you say?

61
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,700
Yeah.
Because I don't,

62
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,130
I don't let it go because I don't want
to lose control of the crowd.

63
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:22,740
I don't want other people to be like,
oh well he talked,

64
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:24,750
I can talk.
And also I,

65
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:25,620
you know,
I just,

66
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,690
I can't concentrate on this bit.
I've done a thousand times.

67
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,730
If in the back of my head I was like,
wait,

68
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:34,230
what's happening right now in the back
of the room?

69
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,510
Yeah.
Well sometimes people just start

70
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,960
commenting like they'll like be right in
front of you too.

71
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,180
Just crazy.
Like in the front row go,

72
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,173
no,
that's not true.

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,880
No,
you can't say that.

74
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,850
Don't say that.
Or they even go.

75
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,750
Yes,
that's true.

76
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,540
Like when they agree with you,
it still sucks,

77
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,300
but what about.
Yeah.

78
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,750
Then they want to put their own spin on
it.

79
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,480
Like it's a conversation.
He had a seizing sometimes,

80
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,320
like I try to tell people,
I'm like,

81
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,760
look,
comedies evocative.

82
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,600
You're going to have a lot of thoughts
and that's okay.

83
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,720
Have the thoughts hold onto those
thoughts later after the show released

84
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,080
thoughts in the wild.
But for now it's okay to think of stuff

85
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,190
and even if you see me out in the lobby
and you want to have you got a question

86
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,320
about some of the material.
Let's talk.

87
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,940
Yeah,
that's a time to talk.

88
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,200
Absolutely not.
Not why you're halfway into the setup.

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,580
Yeah,
it is.

90
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,630
It's such.
I mean,

91
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:30,430
part of why I say it's ego is because if
there's hundreds of people at this show

92
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,510
and they're all quiet and then one
person thinks they're all doing it

93
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,590
wrong.
Yeah.

94
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,270
Like they're just sitting there and be
like,

95
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:37,691
wait,
no,

96
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,980
all these people are wrong there.

97
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,140
We should be interacting.
I need to show them.

98
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,150
It is kind of funny that alcohol's would
they serve at comedy clubs because for I

99
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:49,090
guess for most people it's a good thing.
For most people.

100
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:52,390
Alcohol is a social lubricant relaxes
you.

101
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:56,500
You start laughing a little bit more,
but for some people the fucking,

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,670
the wheels come off and they just want
to chime in and yell out,

103
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,930
well,
if you're an asshole,

104
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,640
alcohol just makes you more of an
asshole.

105
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,600
Yeah,
absolutely.

106
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:08,560
So I think I've had this theory for a
long time that a lot of people will

107
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,300
blame being drunk.
Oh,

108
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,810
I was so wasted.
It's like,

109
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,930
but that's you.
You were still in there.

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,610
There isn't some magical like jekyll and
Hyde thing that's going on.

111
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,030
You peed on someone's truck because he
wanted a p on someone's truck.

112
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,130
Alcohol just gave you the excuse.

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,890
There are people that are alcoholics
though.

114
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,200
We're a switch goes off.
Do you know anybody like that?

115
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,403
Um,
I,

116
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,260
I don't.
You know what,

117
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,660
but I can introduce you to a fair.
I was like,

118
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:36,970
I have a feeling.
I know who some of the people you hang

119
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:39,520
with A.
I guess I don't hang out at the store

120
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,590
and the store is the grand old opry for
hecklers.

121
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,530
Yeah,
I mean it really is this.

122
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:49,330
There's something about that place
because there's no real dorman.

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,560
Everybody's a comic.
It's comics working the gate or comics

124
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,750
working the door.
Comics work in the cover booth.

125
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:58,690
Comics working the room.
It's the only comics.

126
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,270
Comics work in the back parking lot.
It's all Comedians,

127
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,960
so when you're there,
you're.

128
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:06,040
You're under the hands of people who
really don't want to be doing what

129
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,480
they're doing.
They don't really pay attention,

130
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,420
so you have to learn how to deal with
hecklers.

131
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,280
Plus it's a hangout so that places.
There's people packed in that place from

132
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,050
8:00 PM til 2:00 AM and everybody's
hanging around drinking and so there's a

133
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:23,830
lot of alcoholics and so you just get
used to those dudes that have shark

134
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,340
eyes.
Their eyes glass over and they're gone.

135
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,510
You look in there,
you're like,

136
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,040
oh,
bobby's not here anymore.

137
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,250
I didn't meet people like that until I
was 30.

138
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,500
When I.
When I was 30 I started to meet like

139
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,130
real alcoholics where they'd have one
drink and then they were gone.

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,940
They're just off to the races.
But do you think so do you think that

141
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:49,060
they are a completely different person
or do you think that the alcohol just

142
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,170
allows who they are to come out?
Completely speculative because I don't

143
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,190
have that gene.
Whatever that wacky gene is where you

144
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,940
have a couple of drinks and you just go
off the rails.

145
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,190
I don't have that.
I'm a happy drunk.

146
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,090
Like when I get drunk I like to laugh
and hug people.

147
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,120
I don't.
I don't understand the goal blank.

148
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,180
Make a multicav cocktail throat at the
cops wake up in jail.

149
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,620
What the fuck?
What happened?

150
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,770
Who did what?
The weirdest drunk to me is the is the

151
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,660
crying drunk drunk.

152
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,160
That gets super upset because then it's
like,

153
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,050
why would you,
why would you give yourself the

154
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,420
ingredient that you need to cry in the
corner?

155
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,420
Like if you know,
if it's the first time it ever happened,

156
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:27,410
I get it.
Okay.

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,200
But if you're someone like,
I have a friend who every time he gets

158
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,390
drunk he gets like super sad and I was
like,

159
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,430
stop drinking.
It's like,

160
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:36,140
why are you drinking if you're this
upset?

161
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,950
I feel like with people like that,
there's patterns that are deeply carved

162
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,970
into their psyche from childhood.
Like maybe their mom cried.

163
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,450
A lot of their dad cried a lot and they
got used to it and became a comforting

164
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,850
pattern.
But yeah,

165
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,710
those things are.
I mean people say,

166
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh,
well what are you gonna do man?

167
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:53,574
And the guy said,
well,

168
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,560
how the fuck did he get sad lives in
America?

169
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,880
He's got two feet,
doesn't have cancer.

170
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,240
The fuck is he whining about there can
be 100 things wrong.

171
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,480
You're a young white person in America.
We shut up.

172
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,320
I actually don't drink anymore.
I've been sober 12 years.

173
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,540
Damn.
And it was because it was really my

174
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,580
first year on the road when I realized
like,

175
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,680
how much of a problem it could be.
Oh,

176
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,080
so you get it wrong.
So you did it as a preventative measure.

177
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,681
I did it.
Yeah.

178
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,710
It was something where I didn't go
through a program and I found by the way

179
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,260
that like people who have gone through
the program or like,

180
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,250
you know,
really,

181
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,760
you know,
really sober and to me I'm just like,

182
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,500
you needed a program,
you have no willpower,

183
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:33,050
you know,
so it's a bit of a dichotomy there idea

184
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:37,880
that someone could tell you after 12
years of sobriety that you're not

185
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,330
really.

186
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,160
This isn't even consistent.
Yeah.

187
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,710
You don't,
you just choose not to drink and like,

188
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,180
yeah,
I do choose not to drink,

189
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,150
but it's,
yeah.

190
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,540
I haven't had a drink at 12 years.
It was a,

191
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:48,650
it was one of these things where,
I mean,

192
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,240
you know this,
it's free on the road,

193
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,070
you know,
and everybody wants.

194
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:52,970
Everybody goes,
Oh,

195
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:54,980
let me take a shot with you afterward
and be like,

196
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,480
there are 30 of you.
I'm going to die.

197
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,100
Right.
You just do the math on that and you're

198
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,611
like,
I'm going to die.

199
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,870
And I started realizing,
you know what?

200
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,230
I don't have inhibition that alcohol
changes.

201
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,460
Like that same year I had done,
I'd done some show in Bloomington,

202
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:10,400
Indiana and we went to a bar afterwards
and they were a bunch of hot girls

203
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,920
dancing on the bar and I went up in a
dance on the bar with them and I wasn't

204
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:13,550
drunk.

205
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,760
I just wanted to dance with the hot
girls and there were all these like

206
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,750
there all these drunk people you know,
below the bar,

207
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,240
like all these loser guys just kinda
like nursing their beer and looking up

208
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:25,760
and be like,
I wish I could do that and be like,

209
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,560
well then get the fuck up on the bar.
Why?

210
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,820
If you want to do it,
do it.

211
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,630
Can anybody just dance on the bar?
Because that makes me reconsider all the

212
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,230
Times I've touched the bar and then
touched food and then.

213
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,220
Oh yeah,
my phone up there and touch that and

214
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:41,980
then touched food in the bottom of my
shoes are not clean Joe.

215
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,790
Nobody's shoes are clean.
How will you just allowed to.

216
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,790
Is that,
that's kind of violate health codes,

217
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,230
right?
It was a,

218
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,860
I just figure there were enough hot
girls that it was okay that I was there

219
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,360
too.
That's a good call.

220
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,130
Like the ratio has to be.
There have to be still be enough hot

221
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,791
girls.
Now,

222
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,650
did you hook up with one of those girls
afterwards?

223
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,270
Oh No,
I was a pathetic,

224
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,710
sad loser,
but the point is that that I,

225
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:06,060
I didn't need the alcohol to at least
start the process of getting rejected.

226
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,630
That's you.
You have,

227
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,790
you have the unique personality trait
that allows you to get crazy dance on

228
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,730
bars.
Yeah.

229
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,570
That is a strange thing though about the
people that are in those 12 step

230
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,840
programs because they really do get
super attached to the idea that that's

231
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,430
the only way to be sober.
Yeah.

232
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,980
And it's not.
It is a way and if you need that.

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,640
Okay.
Yeah.

234
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,860
More power to you and I,
I,

235
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:26,820
you know,
I do not,

236
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,370
I don't want to take that away from
anybody,

237
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,670
but we're all different and everybody's,
you know,

238
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,610
nerve endings connect differently.
Whatever the hell that biology is of it.

239
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,750
And I didn't need to program,
especially because I would freak out if

240
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,610
they were like,
and this is about Jesus and it will be

241
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,450
like,
go fuck yourself,

242
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,150
give me a beer.
So I,

243
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,870
you know,
I wouldn't,

244
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,250
I wouldn't be able to be comfortable
there.

245
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,600
Did you,
did you ever do a program thing?

246
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:55,050
Did you go to an alcoholics anonymous
meeting or just stop now?

247
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:58,440
I had a.
So I had,

248
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,030
there were a couple of times where I was
like,

249
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,780
alright,
I need to,

250
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,090
I need to quit and quit and that never
works.

251
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,740
And then there was one night where,
so it's,

252
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,750
it's the first real time on the road.
I was terrible with women in high school

253
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,800
and college and then suddenly I hit the
road as a comic and they're everywhere

254
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,900
and they're interested and life is
different.

255
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
And so there was a show.

256
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,720
I was doing the show first already.
And usually the sororities that sponsor

257
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,590
comedy shows or like the philanthropy
sorority and they're all terrible.

258
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,820
Uh,
no,

259
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,690
these girls were all hot.
Just,

260
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,200
just dimes.
The whole chapter just full.

261
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,780
They had like one ugly friend is as the
charity,

262
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,970
but they just gorgeous girls and my
opener goes up and bombs and then I go

263
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:43,470
up to a standing room only crowd and
crush and so now it's afterward we're

264
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,840
hanging out.
There's like this after party thing that

265
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,540
they put together for just them and the
two of us,

266
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:52,200
one of which they hated because he
bombed and the like,

267
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,910
they're just these eight hot girls
surrounding me.

268
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,950
One shoulder,
another one out of the way to sit next

269
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:56,491
to me.
I was like,

270
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,980
this is,
this is like nothing I've ever

271
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:02,190
experienced.
And then they took us to another party

272
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,310
and I'm pretty sure some will put
something in my drink.

273
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,190
Not In the way of like I want to fuck
this guy in the way of like,

274
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,770
this is a guy getting all the attention
away from the other guys.

275
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,200
And I think one of the other guys fucked
with my drink.

276
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,500
Real.
Yeah.

277
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,160
Because I got super violently ill very
quickly,

278
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,660
like very,
very quickly.

279
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,950
And I spent the whole night I was
supposed to stay at the sorority house.

280
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,560
Like the plan was.
I was going to stay in the guest room so

281
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,180
I didn't even have to do the whole
excuse of like,

282
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,530
Hey,
can I use your bathroom?

283
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:29,880
Can I come in for like,
I just,

284
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,690
I was supposed to go back there with
them and I spent the entire night just,

285
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,850
just vomiting.
It was terrible.

286
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,740
Spiked your drink and then I lost a Gig
the next day and at the time.

287
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:43,920
So my first year on the road I lost a
$1,500 gig the next day.

288
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,930
Because you were so sick.
I couldn't do it.

289
00:11:45,931 --> 00:11:47,550
I was,
we were driving,

290
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,280
it was the middle of winter,
but I was wearing two pairs of pants,

291
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:53,290
like two sweatshirts and in a sleeping
bag in the car with the heat on full and

292
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,420
I was shivering the whole way.
Like I was fucked up so don't sure you

293
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,950
didn't have the flu or something.
That sounds like the flu.

294
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,850
It went away like six hours later.
So it could've been,

295
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:07,360
it could've been a very temporary.
Flew a well timed.

296
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:07,991
Flew.
I don't know,

297
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,730
but that was the night where I was just
like,

298
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,420
I can't keep up

299
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,370
doing this.
Have you ever heard of a drug that does

300
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,520
that?
Like a drug that makes you have the

301
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,393
chills?

302
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,450
Man.
Me,

303
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,810
they're probably not.
I might just be like,

304
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,350
no,
it doesn't sound like it.

305
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,070
That sounds like you got something
happened.

306
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,090
Yeah,
it was,

307
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:24,970
uh,
I,

308
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,250
it was just very,
very bad.

309
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,900
And so I realized that it was,
it was not only a chance at like a

310
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:32,500
three,
it was a chance that like a nine some.

311
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,770
So you're like,
all right.

312
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,890
That was more drinking.
Yeah,

313
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,890
none of that.
Wow.

314
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,390
That's a,
that's a wake up call.

315
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,770
Yeah.
The world hands you four aces and you

316
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,710
just throw up on them.
What a hand of cards

317
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,270
that you ever heard of the term dry
drunk.

318
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,680
Now what's that?
Dry drunk is what people like to say.

319
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,681
People who are alcoholics who aren't
drinking but aren't in the program,

320
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,580
are there dry drunks?
And so you still have all the mental

321
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,570
issues that are drunk has.
You're just waiting to go off.

322
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,250
You don't really have the stability that
a 12 step program provides.

323
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,480
That sounds.
That sounds right.

324
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,710
Yeah.
I mean for some people for sure,

325
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,910
but a 12 step program is weird because
it doesn't require belief in a higher

326
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:25,620
power.

327
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,730
It does.
They.

328
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,060
There's a lot of God stuff in there and
like I believe that there was something,

329
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,830
but that something could be a life
force.

330
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:36,480
It could be an energy.
I don't know what,

331
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,180
but I believe it's very possible.
There's something.

332
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:39,990
Yeah,
I don't.

333
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,690
I don't believe that there's A.
I don't believe that there's a bearded

334
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,140
man and wings and all that bullshit.
Be Dope.

335
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,120
There was though.
It wasn't that if you got up to heaven,

336
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,000
he realized that it was all true and
you'll be amazing.

337
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,520
That's so crazy.
I was just a marketing thing.

338
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,700
I just listened to a radio lab the other
day about addiction and they said that

339
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,600
95 or sorry I'm gonna start that over of
100 people.

340
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:07,950
If they started at a aaa on January
first as of December 30,

341
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:11,340
first of that year,
only five would still be in the program.

342
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,160
Basically saying like,
it doesn't work,

343
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,880
but there's a lot of factors that could
be at that could mean that or why that

344
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:20,100
could happen because some people could
start a different program,

345
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,850
they can go to the meeting next door,
but they're saying like only five

346
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:27,450
percent of people will stay in the
program three years through some certain

347
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,160
statistics.
That's a shit retention,

348
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:29,994
right?
Yeah,

349
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,810
but that was a that that radiolab goes
into this,

350
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:37,110
a pill that can cure addiction.
I think.

351
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,140
Well,
they've had an Ibogaine forever.

352
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,470
I began as,
I don't know,

353
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,520
it's a drug that it's from the Boga
plant and it's supposed to be fantastic

354
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:48,620
for people that have heroin addiction,
alcohol addiction,

355
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,800
even addictive personality disorders
problems,

356
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:51,980
things

357
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,010
along those lines.
It's supposedly this ruthlessly

358
00:14:55,011 --> 00:15:00,011
introspective psychedelic experience
that brutally breaks down your pathways.

359
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,560
You're thinking pathways and shows you
why you keep going into this self

360
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:10,280
sabotage mode and it's apparently
unbelievably uncomfortable to go

361
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,410
through.
Psychologically,

362
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,210
physically it's not.
It doesn't feel good,

363
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:19,211
but when it's over,
the rate of retention of the retention

364
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:22,550
of sobriety,
that rate of sobriety that people retain

365
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:25,400
afterwards is staggering.
It's like in the eighties,

366
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:27,170
the high,
80 percent better than anything.

367
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,800
Ruthlessly introspective.
It sounds like a great name of a comedy

368
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:32,990
album does,
right?

369
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,740
Yeah.
The,

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,160
there's a,
there's a treatment center on the one on

371
00:15:36,161 --> 00:15:38,840
one,
like that [inaudible] I passed by and it

372
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,760
like,
it looked like a college campus almost

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,870
and I was like,
what the hell is that?

374
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:44,270
And I looked it up and there's like a,
it's like a treatment center,

375
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:48,530
like an inpatient and you like cut out
everyone in your life kind of thing.

376
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,510
It's one of those,
it's one of those like,

377
00:15:50,511 --> 00:15:51,440
yeah,
it's one of those like,

378
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:52,490
you know,
you're not allowed to talk to people for

379
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:54,320
six months.
But when I looked it up,

380
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,210
I found that on Google and there were
reviews and one of the reviews was if

381
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:01,910
someone who is about to go into the
treatment center and he gave it one

382
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,700
star,
like he was reviewing his own life,

383
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,780
like he was that mess.
He like reviewed.

384
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:10,250
He's like,
well I'm about to take the journey.

385
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,350
The first step of the journey of
sobriety.

386
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,800
And it was one star and I was like,
I think you may have misunderstood how

387
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,030
this rating system works,
buddy.

388
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,710
It might be a dick.
Yeah.

389
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,140
Give something one star if you haven't
even tried it.

390
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,750
I love when you ever just read yelp
reviews too.

391
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,230
Unfortunately.
I love mad at myself.

392
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,180
I know.
But I love when you learn more about the

393
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,310
person and the restaurant.
Yeah,

394
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:32,150
of course.
Yeah.

395
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,920
There was one I saw in New York where,
uh,

396
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,090
this girl,
like she opens the review like,

397
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,830
so I,
I'm back dating again and I'm like,

398
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,980
that's not telling me how the pasta is.
Yeah.

399
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,240
Like I don't,
I don't need to know that.

400
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:47,240
But she uses it or has her own blog.
It was fascinating though because then

401
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,220
you get to know,
should I listen to this moron?

402
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,170
Let me,
let me see what they have to say about

403
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:54,470
David.
Why is it that men these days don't want

404
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,350
to open up a car door,
don't want open up a door for a lady.

405
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:01,460
Get upset when you're expected to pay
and don't understand that you do want

406
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:02,400
your own career.
And like,

407
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,060
and as it turns out that Niki was
fantastic.

408
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah.
You're just annoying.

409
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,450
Yeah.
There's a lot of those.

410
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:11,300
I always go to someone's bad review.
I always go to their page and see what

411
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,940
they think about other stuff.
Yeah.

412
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,020
Just so you can figure out.
It's also tough,

413
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:17,090
like using yelp sometimes in the middle
of nowhere.

414
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,280
That's really tough because then you're
like,

415
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,250
these motherfuckers don't know Sushi.
Like what do they,

416
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,770
what do they know?
Sushi in South Dakota.

417
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,663
Yeah,
exactly.

418
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,310
Fishman.
Yeah.

419
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,520
Yeah.
Yelp is tricky because it's like youtube

420
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,970
reviews and lots of other things.
You're relying on random people you

421
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:40,280
don't like.
Like if I call you up and I go,

422
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:42,140
Hey Steve,
what do you think about this?

423
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,910
Well,
I know Steve's an intelligent guy.

424
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,780
He's going to give me a really nuanced
thought out opinion of whatever we're

425
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,190
discussing.
But if you don't know a person,

426
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,310
you just reading their type,
their type could be.

427
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:54,210
I mean,
when they write,

428
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,110
write things down there,
the printed word could be just as valid

429
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,990
as some fucking psychopaths printed word
mean you don't.

430
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:02,700
You really don't know.
You don't.

431
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,620
You got to go deep,
deep,

432
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:08,670
deep into their,
their paragraphs and you get to really

433
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,630
try to decipher like,
how fucking nuts is this person?

434
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,500
I have a theory.
I have a theory that the way we make

435
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,340
online tolerable that way we make like,
you know,

436
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,600
online not be this,
you know,

437
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,360
just I guess Bastian for angry thought
is everyone's not name,

438
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,430
but everyone's job shouldn't be in
parenthesis,

439
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,440
so we know what people do for a living.
That would help in like how many stars

440
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:37,160
your coworkers give.
You usually get your,

441
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,770
you get yelled at before you're allowed
to yelp.

442
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,480
You know that guy with one star.

443
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,110
I bet he gives out a half a star.
I bet it all the people who work with

444
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,940
him,
they give him a half a star and he puts

445
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,140
one star in for the,
the drug review place and get one star

446
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,150
for his mom.
For Dope Mom.

447
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,270
There was an app that came out that was
like a yelp for people and everyone got

448
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,140
really upset.
What was he yelled for?

449
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,370
Dating.
It was.

450
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,010
Oh,
so it wasn't just okay because it was

451
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:09,570
people you've dated because I thought I
thought the idea because it was,

452
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,970
you know,
the reviews of people and people getting

453
00:19:11,971 --> 00:19:14,490
upset and I was like,
the only people who would get upset at

454
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,620
that are the people who know they're
going to get two stars.

455
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,690
Well,
it's people can just stock,

456
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,300
you know,
someone who's like a Shitty coworker who

457
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,021
had,
that's true,

458
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,900
has it against you can write a bunch of
mean shit about you and then every time

459
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:28,020
you pull up your name,
you see this means shit written against

460
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:28,410
you.

461
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,750
Yet you need to,
I think for the way that to work for the

462
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:33,450
way for that to work as you can only
review someone if you both agree to

463
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:36,030
review each other.
I was reading this thing about this guy

464
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,220
who's getting stalked online,
but this other guy and uh,

465
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,270
they found the person and it was a 17
year old kid that was the son of one of

466
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,520
his friends and had no real beef with
them.

467
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,630
But it was just doing it for sport just
for the fun of it.

468
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,690
Because he knew he could fuck with the
guy and scare him and he did all this

469
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,700
Holocaust Jews stuff and all this
antisemitic stuff is really,

470
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:03,630
really crazy stuff like sent ashes to
their house and left ashes at their

471
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:05,460
front door.
Like a,

472
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,860
just a total psychopath,
a kid,

473
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,920
17 year old kid and it apparently had
haunted this guy for a long time and he

474
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,760
was trying to figure out who it was.

475
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,920
Then he hired someone that's pretty easy
to find people.

476
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:20,580
Once you hire someone who's an expert,
they found the kid like instantly and

477
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:24,900
they realized it was this fucking high
school kid that was the son of one of

478
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,840
his friends and they all had a sit down
and he.

479
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:31,380
They printed up all the stuff that this
kid had written for like a fucking year

480
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,820
and handed it to him and the kid started
crying and I don't know why I did it.

481
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:40,530
And I got addicted to it.
I couldn't stop and like addicted to it.

482
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,290
Well now you're playing a game.
Know,

483
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,110
and if you're not there when the person
is reacting,

484
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,300
especially when you're and your
emotions,

485
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:53,170
maybe they're not so complex or they're
not so rather formed and not,

486
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,120
they're not mature.
Maybe completely aware that every action

487
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,580
has a reaction on the other end whether
you see it or not,

488
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,490
there is a,
uh,

489
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,570
you know,
that movie though the button or whatever

490
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:09,140
it was where like someone like press a
button and someone would die in the

491
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:10,820
world.
I heard about that.

492
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,380
I never saw it.
I didn't either,

493
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,960
but there was,
I think it was an snl sketch about it

494
00:21:14,961 --> 00:21:17,150
where they were like,
they explain the whole premise or like

495
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,540
you press this button in somewhere,
someone the world die and the guy just

496
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:24,320
hits the button and they're like,
we didn't let us finish.

497
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:28,140
Like we would give you a million dollars
and he just hits it again because we're,

498
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,620
we're that like inhuman,
impersonal.

499
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:34,550
Like if you just tell me that someone
somewhere else in the world died,

500
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:36,590
like that doesn't really affect you.
Yeah.

501
00:21:36,591 --> 00:21:38,540
There's too many people anyway.
Yeah.

502
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,840
Hit the button.
Let's clear up the four.

503
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,340
Oh,
five.

504
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,930
Yeah,
I guess it just depends on who.

505
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,420
Yeah,
so if you don't feel it,

506
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,210
it feels like

507
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,470
problem with drones,
right?

508
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,020
Yeah.
I mean they say that drone pilots,

509
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,470
what is this?
Oh,

510
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,920
is that the,
the.

511
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:59,310
They say that a drone pilots suffer
through a lot of severe anxiety when

512
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,600
they're done and like it,
it's apparently incredibly

513
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:09,601
psychologically stressful because you're
doing this weird thing where you sort of

514
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,550
sending this robot and they're doing it
from Nevada.

515
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:15,520
Right?
So the robots are in Afghanistan or

516
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:20,521
Pakistan or Yemen or wherever the hell
they are and they're launching missiles

517
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:25,801
from the sky robots and it just feels so
detached and creepy to the people that

518
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:26,884
are doing it.

519
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,750
Well,
it's the same,

520
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,320
I guess the same psychology of like why
you're able to get into such credit card

521
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,820
debt,
but you wouldn't do that with cash

522
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,300
because like you were,
you,

523
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,870
you see it as just some mythical thing
and then afterward you realize,

524
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:42,700
oh,
this is real life.

525
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,900
You would you be able to,
would you be able to kill someone if you

526
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,580
knew that they were like a bad guy?
Yeah.

527
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,760
And would you feel bad about it?
No,

528
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,680
that's what I think too.
Yeah.

529
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:56,110
I don't think I would.
I mean if someone like Hitler character.

530
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,880
Yeah.
I don't think that doesn't necessarily

531
00:22:57,881 --> 00:23:00,940
have to be quite that bad,
but I mean you really went to the end of

532
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:04,480
the scale immediately.
That's how extreme it was.

533
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,830
Yeah.
I was going for like,

534
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,660
you know,
just the idea of like someone is going

535
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,910
to kill someone that you care about and
you killed that person.

536
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,470
Yeah.
Because there are all these.

537
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,930
Like there's this trope in movies and tv
about,

538
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:18,370
you know,
like a cop shot,

539
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:20,290
someone that they had to shoot in the
line of duty.

540
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:20,861
It wasn't,
you know,

541
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,490
like just killing some kid.
It was,

542
00:23:22,491 --> 00:23:24,040
you know,
shooting a bad guy and then they have to

543
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,550
go to therapy over it.
I feel like.

544
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,750
Yeah.

545
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,390
No.
Have you ever talked to soldiers about

546
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,560
that?
I haven't.

547
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,060
The real ptsd with soldiers is things
they can't control.

548
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,090
That's what really fucks with them.
Like worried about being attacked,

549
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:42,030
worried about being blown up,
worried about driving over an ied.

550
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,210
The soldiers that are proactive,
like Rangers,

551
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,320
Navy Seals,
guys go in and hunt people down.

552
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,080
They don't have that much ptsd,
PTSD.

553
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:54,110
There are different types of people.
I mean,

554
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:56,840
some of them have just been through
crazy firefights and they wake up with

555
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:01,700
horrible nightmares,
but a shocking amount of them realize

556
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,400
they're doing the right thing.
They have to do this,

557
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,620
this needs to be done.
And they're the man to do it.

558
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,510
Yeah.
And they're trained for it.

559
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,910
This is their job and they're all
together and they like a family.

560
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:13,940
It's a feel more superhero ask.
Yeah.

561
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,480
So when you see like a guy,
a cop and a movie that feels bad that he

562
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:18,410
had a shoot,
a bad guy.

563
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,140
That's like the writer,
that's the writer.

564
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,030
If the writer was a cop.
Yeah.

565
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,030
Or maybe a cop that maybe shouldn't be a
cop.

566
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,250
She was definitely some of those out
there.

567
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,030
Or a writer who shouldn't be a writer
or.

568
00:24:30,031 --> 00:24:31,070
Right.
Yeah.

569
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,180
Well,
you know,

570
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,670
I mean those movies,
like how many of these movies have like

571
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,900
these,
like we're talking about the grooves

572
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:42,380
that are carved in that uh,
some people have that get depressed very

573
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:47,381
easily or behave really like really a
sad really easily.

574
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,720
Like those deals,
grooves,

575
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,780
those psychic grooves that they think
that they're supposed to behave like

576
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:56,000
that.
Those are carved into tropes and

577
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:59,460
storylines and plots.
And there's so many plots,

578
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:02,330
there's so many movies you watch,
like you didn't even write this.

579
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,270
Okay.
You knew what has already been written

580
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,570
about these subjects and you just sort
of repeated it with different words.

581
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,940
Yeah.
Like this isn't really a story you wrote

582
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,810
because this story has happened the
fucking million times in movies.

583
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,600
Well,
and it causes those stories existing

584
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,650
then cause people to act like that.
Yes.

585
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,450
Like we.
Yeah.

586
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,330
One of the most fascinating interviews I
ever saw was,

587
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:25,190
you know,
they interviewed the guy who was,

588
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,990
you know,
all the gangster movies in the forties

589
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,150
that say ha,
saying like all that.

590
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,850
And they said,
how did you get the accent so perfect.

591
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,330
And he said,
I made that accent up and then all the

592
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:37,910
gangsters wanted to be like the
gangsters in the movies.

593
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,410
And so then all the gangsters started
talking like that because of that,

594
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,720
because of those movies.
James Cagney.

595
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,590
Yeah.
Wow.

596
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,010
Like that was,
they just told the act like they just

597
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:51,020
started doing it.
Life Imitates Art,

598
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:51,830
right?
Yeah.

599
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,810
And then it's,
you know,

600
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,520
it's a.
and then people feel like,

601
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,500
oh,
well this is normal because that's what

602
00:25:57,501 --> 00:25:58,790
we're shown on television.

603
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,650
Well that was the argument against
Gangsta rap that the argument was that

604
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,010
they were forcing kids by,
you know,

605
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,680
making this music really popular.
They're are forcing kids to accept this

606
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:14,240
type of behavior as being normal and
even exemplary,

607
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,620
like exemplary of a bad motherfucker.
You're shooting people and you ever go

608
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:22,010
back and listen to like the old Nwa.

609
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,510
Oh yeah.
I actually grew up.

610
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,170
So I grew up in Queens,
New York and I was big fan of old school

611
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,720
hip hop now.
I didn't like,

612
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,630
I was never big into the Nwa stuff.
I preferred,

613
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:33,380
you know,
the,

614
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,840
I preferred the lyrics about how great
we are at rapping,

615
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,510
not how many bitches we've killed,
but that was the,

616
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:40,700
that's kind of the line in the sand.
But who are your people?

617
00:26:40,701 --> 00:26:42,660
Who would you like a tribe called quest?
I was,

618
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,830
so when five died.

619
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,850
I'm tribe guys are awesome.
Black sheep.

620
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm a,
I loved a Pete Rock and cl smooth.

621
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,760
We a de la soul guy too.
Yeah,

622
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,381
just,
it was great.

623
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:59,220
I got to when I was 21,
I think I covered.

624
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:04,230
I was in college during the Seinfeld
sendoff party and the place where,

625
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,250
uh,
like the Tom's diner where monks was

626
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,800
based,
the exterior shot was like a block off

627
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:13,470
my campus.
So I made up a fake press pass and I

628
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:17,120
went and I covered the party and I got
to meet del Sol was there and it was

629
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,480
like,
it was so great.

630
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,810
That's nice.
Yeah.

631
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,150
You know,
it was a sad time for me,

632
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,000
man.
When Mc search got his own daytime talk

633
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:24,800
show,
I'm like,

634
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,450
God,
third base I used to love third base.

635
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,040
The end of goes the weasel visa goes
pistor gracile my eyes.

636
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:35,700
Someone hit my eye,
but if you watched the MC search,

637
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,600
a daytime talk show you like,
this can't be real.

638
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,830
He's punking us.
Yeah.

639
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:44,850
This is a character he's playing.
He's doing that Joaquin Phoenix thing

640
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:47,520
that Joaquin Phoenix did for a year.
It's that.

641
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,510
It's that same sort of thing.
When all of a sudden all the adults were

642
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:53,250
talking about the facebook and I'm like,
well,

643
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:54,570
facebook's done now.
Right?

644
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,430
You know,
this isn't going to be fun anymore.

645
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
It's MC search is done because he had
the most pre postures,

646
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,050
daytime talk show.
Did you ever watch it?

647
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,850
I know I knew about it,
but I never watched it.

648
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,580
Oh,
it was such and you know,

649
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,720
I mean,
he's like,

650
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,290
I'm a dead now,
but it was like play the beginning of it

651
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,110
because the beginning of the show,
see if he could find it because the

652
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:23,940
beginning of it is so fucking
preposterous when he explains how we're

653
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,170
gonna.
Keep it real.

654
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,120
We're keeping it real.
Oh,

655
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,280
there's no such thing as that.

656
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,810
Like when people say we're keeping it
real,

657
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:33,420
that means they're just.
They have no other words that they can

658
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,560
think of.
It's madness.

659
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,573
It's just,
it's,

660
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,240
it's a dangerous way of talking.
I was at a,

661
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,900
a I,
I did a bunch of extra work when I

662
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:43,440
started out and which,
that's so much fun.

663
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,401
That's,
Oh my God.

664
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:47,700
Extra work is the best because you get
to see just the worst in humanity right

665
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:52,701
in front of you with the extras.
They're absolute just batch it.

666
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:54,000
And there was a woman,
right?

667
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,960
Oh,
extrusion.

668
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,410
Between going back and forth from extra
work to open mics.

669
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:58,830
And that was my,
that was my day.

670
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,930
I would just go,
just go,

671
00:29:00,931 --> 00:29:03,730
just watch,
just watch people desperately need

672
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:06,180
attention and do nothing of quality to
get it.

673
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,870
So there was this one woman,
they put out the craft services and this

674
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:13,350
one woman goes up and she loads up like
two plates and then putting stuff in her

675
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,184
purse also.

676
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,880
And I just,
she catches me looking at her and she

677
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,650
just goes,
I'm just keeping it real.

678
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,933
And I go,
well,

679
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,270
if you want to know what's real,
they're going to refill this table later

680
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,040
so you can just come get seconds if you
don't have product one and food to take

681
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,360
home though.
Well in the purse,

682
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:32,640
I understand.
But just the idea of it was just,

683
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,290
it was like the start of like a 14 hour
day just keeping it real.

684
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,370
I'm like,
that's not keeping it real.

685
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,420
Just say like,
Hey,

686
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,710
I'm really poor and I'm right now

687
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,390
keeping it real with me.
Dude.

688
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,470
Yeah.
The also that.

689
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,720
But you know,
it was something to stare at.

690
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:49,030
It was very weird.
That's a minor infraction.

691
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,290
You think about the world or holsters
and open mic and the paid furniture

692
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,310
world.
That's one of the.

693
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,930
Keeping it real things about the comedy
store.

694
00:29:55,931 --> 00:30:00,100
You're constantly around crazy.
People Open Michart especially,

695
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,400
they're always hanging around,
you know,

696
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,300
because it's Kinda like a hangout on top
of being a club.

697
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,860
What's the craziest Shit you've seen?
Oh God.

698
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,380
I mean open mics or madness.
I mean there's [inaudible].

699
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:16,090
Anybody can get onstage and a lot of
times that's one of the things about

700
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,860
standup is that a lot of people don't
see themselves that way.

701
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,440
Other people see them.
Yeah,

702
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,270
and that gets exposed when you get
onstage because you realize,

703
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,860
oh,
this is how people see me.

704
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,330
People see me as being an obnoxious,
really annoying person that thinks

705
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,164
they're funny.

706
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,450
I see myself as being this really funny
person and then they have to work that

707
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:41,950
out over the.
I mean it's almost like a self

708
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:46,951
improvement course on communication
skills because you are brutally reminded

709
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,310
of how poor your communication skills
are when you don't get the laughs and

710
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:51,790
you're like,
God,

711
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,650
what is wrong with my thoughts?
This is my thought.

712
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,550
How about my friends think it's funny,
like what is it that's the only someone

713
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,050
who knows what's going on,
right?

714
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,450
The crazy people are the ones that go,
this card doesn't get me.

715
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,700
It was cropped sucks.
Yeah.

716
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,330
It's called bullshit.
I mean,

717
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:06,880
how many times have we heard that?
Just like every crowd I've ever played

718
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:07,840
to,
they all suck.

719
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,520
None of them understand bro,
but the worst thing that can happen,

720
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:15,530
one of those people is some one day
they'll just catch that magic wave where

721
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:19,540
you know there's this one crowd where
almost anyone can do well.

722
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,690
Yes,
there's these weird crowds that are just

723
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:27,691
so good and so hyped up at some with
really shitty skills can get up there

724
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:32,350
and just make it happen and they chased
the ghosts of that performance forever.

725
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,060
Here's a great story that I've told
before.

726
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,410
Unfortunately for people have heard it,
but Joey Diaz was the early days of the

727
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,780
compressor.
There was one woman who is insane.

728
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,330
I mean completely insane.
It just.

729
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,190
There was nothing remotely funny,
but anything she ever had to say,

730
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,130
she was brutal and she would go up and
every time she would go up,

731
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,240
everybody would have to get out of the
room.

732
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,460
It was just like,
what?

733
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,240
What is happening here?
How is she,

734
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,470
how does she even get spots?
It was during the nineties when it was

735
00:31:56,471 --> 00:32:01,471
easier to get spots and so Joey Diaz
goes backstage behind the curtain and he

736
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:07,360
goes backstage and takes his pants off
and every time she hits a punchline he

737
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:09,130
opens up the curtain and chose the
crowd.

738
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:12,850
His balls,
she's got no pants on,

739
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:18,090
so every time she hits the punchlines,
he's doing this and she's killing.

740
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,630
I mean killing.
And you see that confident look in her

741
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:25,640
face.
She has no idea what's in the stride or

742
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,910
swagger and she hits those St punchlines
and all of a sudden Joe,

743
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,020
he comes out with his balls and
everybody's crying,

744
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:34,360
laughing and she,
she never knew.

745
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,890
She never knew.
She had no idea.

746
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,560
No one ever told her.
I don't think so.

747
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,060
If they did,
she would never believed

748
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,791
it.
Bull Shit.

749
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:45,050
I was Carolyn like she was just insane.
I tell.

750
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:50,051
I tell young comics that you don't,
you don't exist in the world.

751
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,730
How you see yourself,
you exist in the world as the sum total

752
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,180
of how everyone else sees you.
That's,

753
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,160
that's who you are and that's true on
stage.

754
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:00,740
Also,
you exist on that stage as the sum total

755
00:33:00,741 --> 00:33:02,160
of how the crowd sees you,
right?

756
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,160
Your actions,
your what you wear,

757
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:05,630
how you stand,
how you speak.

758
00:33:05,631 --> 00:33:09,350
Those can all determine that,
but your thoughts of how you want to be

759
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:12,170
seen,
the difference of how you see yourself

760
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,640
and how everyone else sees you,
that chasm is delusion and so the

761
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:19,430
shorter that chasm,
the more self aware you're going to be,

762
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,890
the funnier you can be.
The bigger that chasm,

763
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,930
the more likely you're going to flip a
table on a reality show.

764
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,970
Yes,
and that's the difference.

765
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,800
Very good point.
That's a very good,

766
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,530
very good way of putting it and it goes
back to what we were talking about

767
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:34,620
earlier that stand up in a lot of ways
is almost like a vehicle for

768
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,610
introspective observation.
Like you're.

769
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,910
You're almost forced to examine yourself
in a way that very few people do because

770
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:45,650
people like to put a blinders and that's
why people like to drink.

771
00:33:45,651 --> 00:33:50,651
You just got to push it all away and
ignore all the faults and press on and

772
00:33:51,361 --> 00:33:53,130
when you're doing standup,
I mean you really.

773
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,700
You can't do that because bombing is so
unbelievably,

774
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,500
brutally painful that you,
you go,

775
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:00,210
okay.
That can't happen again.

776
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,030
If you know you bomb though.
Like I try.

777
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,670
So the,
when I was first living out here,

778
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,480
uh,
I would hang out at the,

779
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,270
there were shows at Westwood Brewco all
the time.

780
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,490
I don't know if you ever did those Adam
Hunter shows?

781
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,170
No,
no,

782
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:12,571
no,
no.

783
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:14,660
Adam prairie.
Well they were a,

784
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,180
so I would hang out there all the time
and there was one night where a bunch of

785
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:23,040
comics had done a show in Long Beach on
the Queen Mary and one by one they were

786
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:24,990
all getting to Westwood and every one of
them.

787
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:26,160
Man,
that show is terrible.

788
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,300
The Queen Mary's a boat by the way for.
Yeah.

789
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,383
Oh yeah,
no.

790
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,430
Yeah.
I guess if people are unfamiliar and be

791
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,760
like,
they all performed on this one lady and

792
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,760
she's a Queen Queen of.
Well it's on the,

793
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,030
it's not even like in a bar called the
Queen Mary.

794
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:42,900
It's on the Queen Mary or what are they
talking about?

795
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,700
Yeah,
they just standing on this lady named

796
00:34:44,701 --> 00:34:47,280
Mary.
And so one by one they would all show up

797
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:49,110
and they'd be like,
there were like 12 people there and it

798
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:52,290
was a nightmare and everyone is talking
about how shitty it was and how

799
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,120
everybody bombed and the night was
terrible.

800
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,600
Then one comment gets there and doesn't
know that everyone had already done

801
00:34:57,601 --> 00:34:59,130
that.
And the first thing he does,

802
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,690
he had just got back from Long Beach.
Man,

803
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,760
I crushed that.
That was such a great show.

804
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,940
Everybody was going nuts and just going
on and on about how great it was.

805
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,310
And the rest of us are just being like,
Oh,

806
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,160
you've never killed.
Because if you think that that was

807
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:13,230
killing,
you've never killed.

808
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,960
You've never had a good show.
If you don't understand what that feels

809
00:35:15,961 --> 00:35:18,360
like or you just lie and tell everybody
all the time.

810
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:20,610
You have good shows,
but it's terrible delusion.

811
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,550
Yeah.

812
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,110
They made me just doesn't understand
himself,

813
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,280
you know?
I mean,

814
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,960
how many guys have you met like that,
that like or that amount around girls or

815
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,330
around a job opportunity around.
It's true.

816
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,370
They think that they're way more
qualified for something.

817
00:35:34,371 --> 00:35:36,200
There are like,
I'm going to go get this flight's

818
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:37,130
president job,
Bro.

819
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,801
I'm gonna.
Go get it.

820
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:38,040
I'm going to

821
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,050
run.
And there's a lot of people are just

822
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,790
completely crazy.
Well,

823
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,040
there's the eye.
I like to tell people,

824
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,630
you know,
follow your dreams and your dreams are

825
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:48,960
stupid because it's good advice if you
like.

826
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,090
If you quit your job to work at
American,

827
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,810
like to audition for American idol and
you've never ever been paid to sing

828
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:56,520
anywhere,
you're a fucking idiot.

829
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,700
Well,
American handles are really good example

830
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,550
because if you watched that show,
the best part about that show is the

831
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,770
beginning where you're just watching
mental illness.

832
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,010
They should call it a mental illness.
Our slash a shreds of talent.

833
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,230
Yeah.
Now because American illness,

834
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,460
for every one person that you get that
gets through the entire,

835
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,360
like who's like the big name stars that
have gone through American,

836
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,420
I'll carry on those.
Those two are huge and there's the guy

837
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,140
who went a little crazy.

838
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,850
The young country music,
gay guy.

839
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:30,780
Akin.
Yeah.

840
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,660
What happened to him?
I was actually in his true Hollywood

841
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,210
story.
I'm glad you said True Hollywood story

842
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,100
because if you said house the other
night.

843
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,510
No,
I was in a.

844
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,370
He was the guy who got me violently ill.
I know

845
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,030
clay aiken drugged me.
I was A.

846
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,340
I was making fun of him to a producer on
the show.

847
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:49,290
Oh boy.
Like she just told me that she was

848
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,050
working on that show and I was just
like,

849
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,010
what?
He was a friend of mine was like,

850
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,600
what are you up to?
Just telling me she's working on the

851
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:55,201
show.
And she goes,

852
00:36:55,201 --> 00:36:55,621
yeah,
you know,

853
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:58,050
we were doing research on.
He used to be acquired boy.

854
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,011
And I just go,
oh.

855
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:01,290
So he started out with hymns and never
quite made it to hers.

856
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,170
And then she just goes,
you want to be on the show?

857
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,003
I was like,
what?

858
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,100
So then that line actually got cut by
the lawyers.

859
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,750
Yeah.
I had a,

860
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,230
I had five jokes that were in the script
and three of the five of them got cut by

861
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,120
the lawyers.
Fucking lawyers,

862
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:16,200
man.
That's why lawyers,

863
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:18,570
you can't have podcasts.
No,

864
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,100
you can't.
You're not allowed.

865
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,980
You fucks like a lawyer podcast.
They can't come on them,

866
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,990
they can't.
You can't have a lawyer telling you what

867
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:27,040
you can and can't say about podcasts.
You just,

868
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,500
you know,
loud because it's.

869
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:32,880
This is the last place is the last
bastion of free speech as far as like

870
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,370
just expressing yourself in
conversation.

871
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,070
There's no.
This is the only one left there.

872
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:39,570
Easily trick though.
I used to be.

873
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,780
I used to be a segment producer on a
show and we would always put in stuff we

874
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,940
didn't want to use so that they could
come in the room and be like,

875
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:48,211
no,
no,

876
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:48,420
no.

877
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,700
You have to take that out,
take that out and then leave in the

878
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,140
thing that we thought they would take
out.

879
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,090
Well,
I'm sure you've seen the scene in team

880
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:55,230
America,
world police,

881
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,740
they the sex scene between the two
puppets,

882
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,020
they made like 10 minutes longer than
they wanted it to be where he shits on

883
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:07,440
her chest or she shits on his chest.
They pee on each side on both.

884
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,270
They went nuts and the reason why they
did it,

885
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:12,030
it was because they could cut some of
it.

886
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:14,670
It would still be preposterous.
Which it wound up being.

887
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,860
Yeah,
but that,

888
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,280
that's a common strategy that we did
that in the nineties with news radio,

889
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:25,281
we had an episode of news radio where
Phil Hartman said Penis on the air on

890
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:28,860
the radio show,
and then it was through the episode.

891
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:32,350
He said Penis like 20 times and they,
uh,

892
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,530
they were like,
you can't say penis more than eight

893
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,170
times.
And it was like eight times.

894
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,700
Who makes that it's fucking assholes.
Assholes,

895
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:43,620
assholes who decide what America is
willing to tolerate.

896
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,230
Crazy rebel bro.
I think it was four times,

897
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,460
but they,
uh,

898
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,290
they didn't air it so it didn't air.
It seems that at all.

899
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,580
No,
it had an air in like season two or

900
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:57,040
three,
like whatever season it was.

901
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,020
Maybe it was season two.
I don't remember what season it was,

902
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,800
but it,
it had an air leg the next season or the

903
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,940
season later.
And like we were told,

904
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:05,410
hey,
the penis episodes Aaron tonight.

905
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:06,244
We were all like,
what?

906
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:09,200
It's still never heard.
I never heard.

907
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,510
I love so much that there's something
called the penis episode,

908
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,551
by the way.
Good,

909
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,710
bad name the penis episodes.
Yeah,

910
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,553
that's good.
Bad name.

911
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,850
That would totally play at the whiskey.
Yeah,

912
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:21,430
like a fucking punk band.
The Penis Penis episode.

913
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,930
Yeah.
It's part of the patriarchy.

914
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,490
Yeah.
Uh,

915
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,030
yeah.
I,

916
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,050
I think that,
uh,

917
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,970
I,
I used to call it a march of the

918
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:32,820
penguins because all the suits would
come down the hallway and tried to ruin

919
00:39:32,821 --> 00:39:33,840
our art.
Uh,

920
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,090
but the idea that someone goes,
well,

921
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,480
it says specifically eight times,
you can say penis.

922
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,340
It's so hard

923
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,960
retread.
It's totally arbitrary and there's no

924
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,840
rules anywhere.
What happens on the nighttime,

925
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,320
like beetle juice comes out or penis
choose comes seat.

926
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,250
Satan comes through the floor.
There's a way to,

927
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:51,680
uh,
to do art.

928
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,820
And it's definitely not by having a
bunch of people that have money invested

929
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,110
in it,
looking at it going,

930
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,090
okay,
how can we maximize this?

931
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,570
How can we make this as sellable as
possible?

932
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,400
That's just the opposite of the kind of
mentality that you need to make

933
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:09,770
something good.
And if it just like you were talking

934
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:13,610
about with comedy or people don't see
themselves,

935
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,040
if you don't see yourself,
how other people see it's not going to

936
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,290
work and it won't be funny.
Well that's kind of the same thing with

937
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,810
art.
If you produce a television show or a

938
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,090
whatever it is and people don't enjoy it
while it won't go anywhere,

939
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,000
it'll fall off and then it's not good
anymore.

940
00:40:29,001 --> 00:40:31,610
But to have someone come in and say,
Oh,

941
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:34,070
you got to do this and you got to do
that because we know better because

942
00:40:34,071 --> 00:40:35,960
we're the ones with the money that never
works.

943
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,560
But every time,
every time I think that I remember that

944
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:40,720
according to Jim had over

945
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,310
100 episodes,
over a hundred episodes,

946
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,051
but that's.
There's a,

947
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,910
there's a style of comedy.
It had over a hundred episodes.

948
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,750
I remember Jag,
Jag was online,

949
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,300
I was on news radio and we were always
like,

950
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:55,320
what in the fuck is going on?
How is that a real show?

951
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,780
If you've ever watched that show?
Nobody watched that show.

952
00:40:57,781 --> 00:41:00,360
And the people that did watch that show,
it's like they were sedated.

953
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,230
It's like it's a hum and under which
like subliminal messages were played in

954
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:07,380
the background about Bush being a great
president or something,

955
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,450
like it didn't make any vulcans and it
didn't make any sense that it stayed on

956
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:12,930
the air.

957
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,430
You watch any of the CSS or any of those
are the know the one I'm thinking of

958
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,630
Ntis.
So I,

959
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:24,240
I saw an episode the other day I get
transfixed with bad television.

960
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,970
Like I never put it on purpose,
but if like someone,

961
00:41:26,971 --> 00:41:29,880
if I'm like in a hotel room or something
when I flip it on or whatever it is,

962
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:32,730
like it takes me a little to just shake
it off because I just want to be like,

963
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,400
how is this mate?
How is this possible?

964
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:36,980
You know?
And so I was watching it and I was

965
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:39,500
thinking like the comedy in it was so
bad.

966
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,620
Like the jokes were so terrible that I
almost wondered,

967
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,120
you know,
they hire people for punch up.

968
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,900
Do they hire people for punch down?
Like do they hire people to be like

969
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:49,130
water down these good job?

970
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,770
Well that's the chuck Lorre Guy.
He knows how to do them.

971
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,100
He knows how to do that drone that,
that one style of comedy,

972
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,200
like two and a half men.
Yeah,

973
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,460
he did a bunch of the white noise
machine.

974
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,880
He just does those things.
I

975
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,530
know that for people that are all just
like exhausted from eating carbs and

976
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:12,740
sugar all day and they just sitting in
the couch of some melting.

977
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,960
Then the dumbest fucking humor plays out
in front of them and it's just enough to

978
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:20,480
keep them paying attention.
So they watched those Toyota

979
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:21,314
commercials.

980
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,530
I,
I was,

981
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,250
you know,
very often I wonder about like how does

982
00:42:26,251 --> 00:42:27,450
this get made?
How is this,

983
00:42:27,451 --> 00:42:29,060
why does anybody like this,
et cetera.

984
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,950
And I was at some truck stop in the
middle of nowhere,

985
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,120
just getting gas and getting food and
there's a tier of the TV playing.

986
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:40,470
It was like a little lunch counter and
there's a TV playing and as a commercial

987
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,580
and there's this guy running around.
It's for blinds,

988
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:47,980
but this guy is running around.
He like tries to open those blinds,

989
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,390
Kinda has nothing to do with it.
And then he runs outside and you get

990
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:53,130
stung by a bunch of stung by a bunch of
bs and he's like fighting them off.

991
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,050
And I'm sitting there thinking like,
oh,

992
00:42:55,051 --> 00:42:56,240
what the fuck?
Who the fuck would do?

993
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,930
I can write commercials like,
who would do that?

994
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,780
And there's a dude sitting next to me
just going,

995
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,510
he's,
he can't get away from the bees like

996
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:07,670
just out loud to know what to know.
One just like he's all over it.

997
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,530
They're all over the zoo.
It's for,

998
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,110
oh,
it was at my friend's house once and her

999
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:19,580
friend and her mom was over and uh,
they were watching like some spiderman

1000
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:23,750
movie and Spiderman got bit by a spider
and she just goes,

1001
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,860
he got bit by a spider will never,
I'll never forget that.

1002
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:34,220
Never forget to go.
He got bit by a spider like I gotta get

1003
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:37,070
Outta here.
Just one of these things the rest of us

1004
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,860
didn't see.
There's just something about like,

1005
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:42,380
man,
I just think just like you can buy a

1006
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:46,190
prius or you could buy a shelby gt,
500,

1007
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:48,350
you know,
one one has 100 horsepower,

1008
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,590
one has 500 horsepower.
Brains are like that too.

1009
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,670
They just have to be.

1010
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,120
There's just no doubt about it.
And there's a lot of those little prius

1011
00:43:56,121 --> 00:43:57,140
brains out there,
man.

1012
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,480
And if you put on a show for Prius
brains,

1013
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,290
you will attract them like,
like metal to a magnet.

1014
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,260
Just
find it.

1015
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,160
Those,
those,

1016
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,650
the duck dynasty shows you ever watch
duck dynasty?

1017
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,880
I have thankfully not even seen a
clinic.

1018
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:13,790
Shit.
Fucking watch it for sure.

1019
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,610
Just to understand that there's people
like that out there that look forward to

1020
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:17,620
it.
I got to Dvr.

1021
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,500
I said,
you know,

1022
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:20,540
I heard what today they're going to do.
Shoot some ducks.

1023
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,000
She won't use them.
Duck duck show,

1024
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,700
duck.
And they shoot it.

1025
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,910
They don't even shoot it.
Hardly.

1026
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:30,911
Shoot ducks show is more about like
horrible people hanging out doing really

1027
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,190
boring

1028
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,790
shit and locked.
They're all down home.

1029
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,180
They're down home their country.
That's why.

1030
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,600
That's why the people who like when the
people say like,

1031
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,100
Oh,
you know,

1032
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,020
I voted for Bush because I can,
you know,

1033
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,550
he reminded me of me and I'm just like,
when you're a fucking asshole.

1034
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:49,650
Also,
like,

1035
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:52,200
you're also like to think you reminded
them of them.

1036
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

1037
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,810
It was your dad a multimillionaire and
did you grow up in Maine and pretend you

1038
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:57,210
from Texas?
Like what about him?

1039
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,780
What about the fact that your dad was
your dad in the CIA to where you see

1040
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,360
that you see that with trump now where
people are like,

1041
00:45:03,361 --> 00:45:04,920
oh,
he reminds me of me and I'm just like,

1042
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:07,500
he the furthest thing from you?
He's the,

1043
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,710
he's the.
I grew up in New York City and so like I

1044
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:15,300
remember I was a kid when it happened,
but I remember the central park jogger

1045
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:20,130
when trump took out for full page ads in
different newspapers calling for the

1046
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:24,000
death penalty for these black kids who
didn't even do it and he was just

1047
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:25,080
inciting a riot.

1048
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,360
Basically.
He was just trying to race bait and get

1049
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:30,480
attention and that's the guy I remember.
No,

1050
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,270
I don't relate to that guy.
Yeah,

1051
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:37,050
he's a real tough guy to relate to.
I don't think people really do relate to

1052
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:38,670
them.
I think what they relate to is the

1053
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,910
possibility that he may win and they
like to be on the camp of a winner.

1054
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,460
So like a football team that they can
get behind.

1055
00:45:44,461 --> 00:45:46,050
They don't really give a shit about the
players.

1056
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,930
They just decide we're going to win.
We're fucking winning.

1057
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,240
We're winning.
We're trump trump's winning.

1058
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,590
But the trump winning all those
dickheads.

1059
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,550
Yeah,
they.

1060
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,320
But they also say the things like,
you know,

1061
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,690
like he speaks like I do,
like that's,

1062
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,740
I don't want a president who speaks
like,

1063
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,390
and I do feel fairly intelligent guy.
I want my president to be wasting harder

1064
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:06,780
than me.

1065
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,060
I would like a really articulate Obama
type guy,

1066
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,740
but that didn't work out.
Yeah.

1067
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:14,130
Had the Obama type guy was like,
what we were hoping for.

1068
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:16,110
Like when,
when Bush was in office,

1069
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,530
Obama was like,
the fucking recipe man.

1070
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,010
We want a black guy who's super
articulate,

1071
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:25,830
really intelligent and well,
we're kind of relax.

1072
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:27,510
Everybody would always race bullshit.
Look,

1073
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,220
clearly,
it has nothing to do with race,

1074
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,220
it's about culture and circumstances and
where are you growing up?

1075
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:33,420
Look at this guy.
He's black.

1076
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:35,370
He's smarter than all of us were.
Good luck.

1077
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:36,930
He's liberal.
He's going to fix everything.

1078
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:39,070
He's going to relax everybody.
He doesn't want to.

1079
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,490
Guantanamo Bay wants to get us out of
Iraq.

1080
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,590
We made it through this Bush thing.
We didn't.

1081
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,110
Civilization collapsed and then he's an
office in his own.

1082
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:49,740
It was kind of the same shit.
He talks better.

1083
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,780
Yeah,
that's kind of the same shit is going

1084
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:53,790
on.
I think the biggest problem is that he's

1085
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:58,140
too reasonable,
like he's too reasonable and the people

1086
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:00,840
who disagree with him or being
completely unreasonable and you can't

1087
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:01,411
just be like,
well,

1088
00:47:01,411 --> 00:47:03,750
let's look at both sides.
If one side is being a Dick,

1089
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,240
you don't look at.
It's like CNN will do that.

1090
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:06,691
Where they're like,
well,

1091
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:08,100
let's present both sides of this
argument.

1092
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:11,370
Here's one person against pedophilia,
so let's talk to someone who's for

1093
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,210
pedophilia.
And it's like,

1094
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:14,300
no,
don't give that guy airtime.

1095
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,230
Right.
Don't ever talk to that guy.

1096
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:17,320
Yeah.
So.

1097
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,970
So the people who you know,
who want to take rights away and who

1098
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,820
want to convince poor people to vote
against their own best interests,

1099
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,210
like you don't give them equal time,
but they do well.

1100
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,130
The problem is you're dealing with right

1101
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,880
and left and then again,
people get really tribal.

1102
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,350
Yeah.
When they're on a team,

1103
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:37,610
they get super tribal,
like I told,

1104
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,600
told us before.
But it's always struck me as being

1105
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,940
really bizarre.
I was with a buddy of mine is a writer

1106
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,090
and he was talking about the election.
He's like,

1107
00:47:46,091 --> 00:47:49,180
we have to win in Idaho if we went in
Idaho or Iowa.

1108
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,130
We went in Iowa,
we got it wrapped up.

1109
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:51,851
I was like,
what is this?

1110
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:53,890
We,
I guess as we shit,

1111
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,060
it's like the Democrats.
So I'm like,

1112
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,470
okay,
you're on a team,

1113
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,640
right?
You're on a team,

1114
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:59,440
you're fucking.
This is the mariners,

1115
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,200
this is the marriage versus the raiders.
You've got your,

1116
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,060
you've got this weird team mentality.
And I think that's entirely one of the

1117
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,990
things that is real comfortable for
people to fall into when it comes to

1118
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,840
elections.
And it's one of the reasons why I think

1119
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:17,350
we need way more parties,
at least at least that way we'll have

1120
00:48:17,351 --> 00:48:22,351
more teams because this one is two team
option is like if every fucking year it

1121
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,980
was a celtics versus the Lakers in the
NBA finals game,

1122
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,110
wouldn't you be tired of that after
awhile?

1123
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,580
Well that's I think how America feels
about the election.

1124
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,280
That's why the ratings are down.
That's why people aren't really paying

1125
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,070
attention that much.
That's why people are so frustrated by

1126
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:38,440
the choices.
Like you can't be kind of just two

1127
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:39,250
choices.

1128
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,510
Well I used to be,
you know,

1129
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,850
very politically minded and,
and active.

1130
00:48:42,851 --> 00:48:47,110
And I used to do a lot of like everybody
should go out and vote and then I talked

1131
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:48,640
to more and more people and then I'm
just like,

1132
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:49,710
not everybody.

1133
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:54,410
Yeah.
Well it would be nice if we didn't have

1134
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:56,510
a representative government.
Yeah,

1135
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,830
it would be nice.
First of all,

1136
00:48:57,831 --> 00:49:00,260
if you didn't have like one like super
delegates,

1137
00:49:00,261 --> 00:49:02,990
what is that?
What do you mean you don't have to vote

1138
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:04,510
for the people that you're Stateville

1139
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:08,650
superdelegates were basically to keep
Jesse Jackson out of office.

1140
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,660
Like that's,
that's how they started.

1141
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,590
Really?
Yeah.

1142
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:14,230
When Jesse Jackson was starting to get
some heat and I think it was 1980,

1143
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,920
uh,
suddenly there was 80 or 84,

1144
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:19,720
I forget,
but it was a suddenly superdelegates

1145
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:21,180
came out,
but good job.

1146
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:24,610
Super d'elegance kept that fucking demon
out of the White House.

1147
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:27,970
Not only super delegates though,
but even the delegates of the electoral

1148
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:30,550
college,
they don't have to vote the way their

1149
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,410
constituents do.
In fact,

1150
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,740
there was a time when one of them,
I think it was in Minnesota,

1151
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,280
accidentally wrote down the name of the
vice president in both slots for

1152
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:40,360
president,
vice president.

1153
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,990
So his vote didn't count and that was
like 30,000 people that he was

1154
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:44,824
representing.

1155
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,070
Whoa.

1156
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,780
And just because he was a fucking idiot.
And like you,

1157
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,520
you can actually,
if you're now obviously people wouldn't

1158
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:54,230
do it for the most part because you'd
think,

1159
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:56,810
oh well then they lose the ability to do
it and that's all the little power they

1160
00:49:56,811 --> 00:49:58,790
have in their life is to be a delegate
at this convention.

1161
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,120
But the fact of the matter is that like
New York state can vote 100 percent for

1162
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:07,970
a Democrat and then the electoral
college can go and just vote for

1163
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,260
Republican.
It can just,

1164
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:11,300
they can do it if they want to or vote
for a Democrat,

1165
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,500
they can write someone in if they want
to.

1166
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,860
It's a ridiculous idea that was
conceived back when you were in.

1167
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,670
You couldn't communicate with people
easily.

1168
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,070
Yeah.

1169
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,820
It was that simple.
It was the point of it was that like not

1170
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:25,000
everyone was qualified to vote because
you didn't hear things.

1171
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,590
Yes.
And so they would be like,

1172
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,220
well,
here's the representative government.

1173
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,711
They'll,
you know,

1174
00:50:28,711 --> 00:50:31,160
learn from what their people want.
And then they'll take that over there.

1175
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,980
And it was a wonderful idea.
And now it's bullshit.

1176
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:35,480
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.

1177
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,040
And it's time has gone.
I mean,

1178
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,360
we,
if we,

1179
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,190
this is the point that I always bring
up,

1180
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,230
if we didn't have a system of government
in place,

1181
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:45,410
we had all these people.
We all just woke up today who would say

1182
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,280
we need one person to run it.
No one who would say that we need one

1183
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:53,380
person to be representative of the state
because the people can't tell everybody

1184
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,590
know,
will you have an email now?

1185
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,090
We have twitter,
we have facebook,

1186
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:57,380
we have poles,
we have.

1187
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:00,230
There's ways to find out what people
want and people don't want to.

1188
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,730
Representative government in 2016 is
like writing with feathers.

1189
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,760
It's like some old stupid shit that we
don't need anymore.

1190
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:10,580
We should make them right with feathers.
Who should make them wear powdered wigs

1191
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:11,870
to those fucks.
Yeah.

1192
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,450
Feel like you want this office while it
comes with a couple of things.

1193
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,820
I mean if you want to be like one of
those people,

1194
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:18,950
you should dress like one of those
people that invented it.

1195
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,940
Then there'd be no hillary email scandal
because it would just be like maybe she

1196
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:25,080
wrote on the wrong kind of parchment.
Yeah,

1197
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:27,560
she wrote on the actual animal skins and
said,

1198
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:29,240
we don't do that anymore.
Hillary,

1199
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,230
you're doing old school.
She's doing old school with her non

1200
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:33,230
encrypted email,
right?

1201
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,580
Yeah.
Have you talked about,

1202
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:37,280
I assume you've talked about the gorilla
already.

1203
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,930
Yeah,
we kind of talked about it a little.

1204
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:40,670
Did we think we did?
Yeah.

1205
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,880
That's fucked up.
Yeah,

1206
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,970
it's fucked up for the zoo.
The zoo fucked up.

1207
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,850
You shouldn't make it so God damn easy
to get in the gorilla tank.

1208
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,330
Yeah,
it.

1209
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:50,900
So on this one,
I don't know exactly what happened on

1210
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:53,870
this one cause I'm,
I'm trying to kind of block it out.

1211
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,470
I saw the whole thing so that the kid
kid fell in.

1212
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,720
Was it,
was it like a kid falling in where the

1213
00:51:59,721 --> 00:52:02,180
parent was at fault or was it a kid
doing something they shouldn't have

1214
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:02,661
done?
Well,

1215
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,340
the kid was doing something and
shouldn't have done,

1216
00:52:04,341 --> 00:52:05,810
but the parents weren't watching the
kid.

1217
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:06,783
Yeah.
Look,

1218
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,800
the zoo made it way too easy to get into
the grill and closure.

1219
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,150
The kid got through the fence,
fell down into this water.

1220
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:19,390
The gorilla came in and scooped up.
The kid arguably saved the kid but was

1221
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:23,300
handling it in a way that it could
handle a gorilla baby,

1222
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,420
but a human baby,
you just ripped the arms off the kid.

1223
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:30,500
He could really,
really hurt it and I just don't think a

1224
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:35,390
gorilla is even aware of how fragile a
three year old human being is as opposed

1225
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:35,750
to.

1226
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,170
Have you ever had a three year old champ
or three year old girl in near you?

1227
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,000
A.
I can't say I've ever had that

1228
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:43,250
experience.
I was on a TV show.

1229
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,300
It was on his radio and they brought in
a champ for a scene in this two year old

1230
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:51,770
chimp with a diaper on was like I was
holding it and it was was beating on me.

1231
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:53,780
It was like hit me in the back,
like playing around with me.

1232
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:59,070
They're unbelievably strong and sinewy
like a little tiny bodybuilder.

1233
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,840
Like they don't feel like a baby.
Like I have little kids and when you

1234
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,060
pick up a little kid,
they're all soft and they feel like

1235
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:05,900
little kids,
they're,

1236
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,380
they're mushy.
This just champ was not mushy and I

1237
00:53:09,381 --> 00:53:14,381
think this gorilla probably had no idea
how to handle a baby softly,

1238
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,980
you know,
probably our toddler really didn't,

1239
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:19,490
didn't know.
And they panicked and then they shot the

1240
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:22,340
gorilla.
But it seems to me that there's gotta be

1241
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:24,920
a better way to do that.
But I could see the parents being,

1242
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,130
fuck that gorilla,

1243
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,180
shoot it,
shoot it.

1244
00:53:27,181 --> 00:53:28,650
I want my kid back.
Yeah.

1245
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:30,750
But I could see the gorilla being like,
fuck those parents.

1246
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,400
Yeah.
But I like people more than I like

1247
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,211
gorillas.
I do.

1248
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:35,490
And I love your joke about team people.
You know,

1249
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,540
it's,
it's.

1250
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,590
I mean it's a,
it's a bit I,

1251
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,570
I enjoy,
but there was a there.

1252
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,620
So there was a bit I used to do.
There was a store in Chicago like 15

1253
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:47,580
years ago where a woman was holding her
baby over gorilla pit.

1254
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,450
Oh yeah.
I remember that.

1255
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,780
Like holding it straight up and then
drop the baby and on that one the

1256
00:53:51,781 --> 00:53:53,870
gorilla saved the kid and picked it up
and,

1257
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:56,310
and kept until the zookeeper could give
it back to the mother.

1258
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:58,800
And the joke I used to do is be like,
I'm sorry,

1259
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,900
give it back.
Like at that point,

1260
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:05,490
a gorilla is a better parent than the
person who wants you voluntarily dangle

1261
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:09,600
your baby over a wild animal.
It's death you giving of the baby away.

1262
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:10,800
Well,
we've even made it

1263
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:15,680
way too easy for people to survive.
People survived very little adversity.

1264
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,190
We survive with.
It's easy access to food,

1265
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,980
easy access to employment.
If you get fired,

1266
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:25,100
you get to sue.
If you're incompetent completely,

1267
00:54:25,101 --> 00:54:27,800
you can claim that you were harassed at
work.

1268
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:32,330
There's so many loopholes and it's so.
We're so nerfed.

1269
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,530
Every sharp edge is covered with foam
and everyone's wearing a helmet.

1270
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,200
The nerfing of America,
and this is what we got left.

1271
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:43,490
We've got these fucking idiots.
We've got a bunch of really dumb people

1272
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:46,970
that are allowed to fuck and have kids.
And you can't stop people from having

1273
00:54:46,971 --> 00:54:49,460
kids because then someone can try to
stop you.

1274
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,700
Well,
I don't like your belief,

1275
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:52,520
Steve Hofstetter.
You're a crazy liberal.

1276
00:54:52,521 --> 00:54:54,850
You think you should.
I think you should be able to have a

1277
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:59,150
nation that's not under God and you're
gonna raise your children without God.

1278
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,420
That's child abuse and then you on my
show the other day,

1279
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,070
nobody shows,
but you know,

1280
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,050
I just think they're human beings need a
certain amount of adversity.

1281
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,490
We need a certain amount of difficulty
to overcome to learn those lessons,

1282
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,480
to filter that experience down into your
behavior and when you don't learn those

1283
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:24,140
lessons and you just live this muted,
nerved up world,

1284
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,420
then you're holding your fucking baby
over the gorilla tank because you

1285
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:27,860
getting a little thrill.
Who's,

1286
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,540
whoops,
I'm dumb.

1287
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,360
I dropped the baby.
Just like you drop your cell phone just

1288
00:55:38,361 --> 00:55:40,640
like you drop your keys and the fucking
drainage ditch.

1289
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,290
You're a dummy.
You drop shit.

1290
00:55:42,291 --> 00:55:44,240
You're a stupid fuck.
And not supposed to be alive.

1291
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:46,670
Should have been eaten by wolves.
Hundreds of years ago.

1292
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,580
The world was safe.
You would have been the one who walked

1293
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:52,040
off the trail.
I'm going to go find a better word to

1294
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,980
the council and the wolf's would have
eaten you and no one would have heard

1295
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,990
from you.
And that's what it's supposed to happen

1296
00:55:56,991 --> 00:55:57,860
to those types of people.
Well

1297
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,510
it is Darwin.
I'm a big fan.

1298
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,770
Big Fan.
Big Fan.

1299
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,630
He had some good ideas.
Chris bowers,

1300
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:05,670
I don't know if you know him.
He's a comic out of.

1301
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,260
Oh,
you've worked more days.

1302
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,600
So,
uh,

1303
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,810
in Indianapolis.
Yeah.

1304
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:12,880
Chris and I are two of the owners.
Oh yeah.

1305
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,280
No Shit.
Yeah,

1306
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,850
what a great club.
That's awesome man.

1307
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:17,640
It's even better.
We had new location now.

1308
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,710
Oh no shit.
You guys moved A.

1309
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,660
Yeah,
we have a balcony and everything now.

1310
00:56:21,661 --> 00:56:22,850
It's great.
It's like a,

1311
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,490
it like a small theater.
Oh,

1312
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:26,530
that's terrific man.
That was a great club.

1313
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,790
No,
that was a fun one.

1314
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,620
Everybody loves that place.
That's cool though.

1315
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:30,690
I didn't know you own that place.
Yeah.

1316
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,280
Good for you.
You fucking entrepreneur as well.

1317
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:36,010
Uh,
so bowers has a great theory where,

1318
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:36,781
you know,
the,

1319
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:39,610
the way to I guess,
prevent the stupid people in the

1320
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:44,611
overpopulation is if everyone is
basically sterilized and you have to

1321
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:47,890
take something in order to be able to be
pregnant.

1322
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:52,570
But the only way you get that pill is
you have to take that pill every day.

1323
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,490
You don't take a pill to stop yourself
from being pregnant.

1324
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:56,080
You take a pill to get yourself
pregnant,

1325
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,110
so you have to take that pill.
Both partners would have to take that

1326
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:04,111
pill every day for six months because if
you can't commit to taking a pill every

1327
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,730
day for six months,
you can't raise a kid.

1328
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,620
Yeah,
but it's so easy for people to just do

1329
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:09,520
that.
That's not.

1330
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,840
That's not enough of a fucking start.
It should be like one of those crows

1331
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,850
have to get a crumb out of a tube and
they have to use one tool to get the

1332
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:23,320
other tool to get the third tool.
That's how it should be.

1333
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:25,000
It's too fucking easy.
Just take a pill.

1334
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,970
You should have to do a puzzle everyday.
That should give you a puzzle,

1335
00:57:27,971 --> 00:57:30,310
and if you fail creasing difficult,
you don't get a pill,

1336
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:35,460
so you get six months of correct answers
to puzzles to get your pills.

1337
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,390
That's the only way she'd be able to get
your pills.

1338
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,720
I think that's how chipotle,
he gave away free Burrito once on their

1339
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,400
annual anniversary.
If they did it that way for people the

1340
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:45,350
fucking four.
Oh,

1341
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,380
five would be a breeze.
Yeah,

1342
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:50,740
it would be nobody just be a couple
people waving at each other.

1343
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:54,190
We made it.
You ever watch you ever watch like a

1344
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,860
period piece?
Television where they run into people

1345
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:58,500
they know like,
like a mad men.

1346
00:57:58,630 --> 00:58:01,130
They would always like run into people
at the restaurant that they would know

1347
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,530
and part of me is like,
oh,

1348
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:03,670
well that's convenient.
Then I'm like,

1349
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:04,300
no,
no.

1350
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,400
There are fewer people.
There were fewer people then it was.

1351
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:09,250
It seems.
It seems possible.

1352
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,390
It's definitely possible.
It was possible in the nineties when I

1353
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:16,330
moved here in 1994,
there was half as many people.

1354
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,140
I wonder what the actual statistic was,
but I'm pretty sure is half as many

1355
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:24,310
people like when you would get,
you'd get on the highway and the traffic

1356
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:26,170
would be bad,
but it wouldn't be that bad.

1357
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,020
Would be no big deal.
I remember people talking about getting

1358
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:31,240
from Santa Monica to the valley in 10
minutes.

1359
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:34,540
What exactly?
Ten minutes,

1360
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,220
that's what it wanted to drive a
Delorean,

1361
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,570
regular car.
Just get in your car and drive.

1362
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:41,620
And this back when cars were slow as
shit and the brakes were terrible.

1363
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:44,020
There was no traffic.
You just get around.

1364
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,940
It's only nine miles.
No problem.

1365
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,580
They just did it.
It's the same as a a,

1366
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,600
you know,
planes.

1367
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:54,370
I mean I've only been flying about 20
years but 20 years ago and now that's

1368
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,620
part of because they do the spoke
garbage now where they,

1369
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,870
you know,
you have to fly through Cincinnati to go

1370
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:01,420
to Denver or whatever it is.
But it's,

1371
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:03,730
everything's full.
Every single flight is full.

1372
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,680
Like the idea when someone doesn't have
a seat next to you on if it's a

1373
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:08,470
Christmas party.

1374
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:10,840
Oh yeah.
Well how about when they say,

1375
00:59:10,841 --> 00:59:14,320
we've oversold this flight,
we're looking for volunteers.

1376
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,240
What do you,
you're selling some shit.

1377
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:18,610
You don't even really have.
They absolutely do that.

1378
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:21,380
But in fairness,
we can do that with comedy clubs too

1379
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:23,180
because there's always a percentage of
no shows.

1380
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,270
So there's,
do we,

1381
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,230
do you do that at mortise?
Uh,

1382
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,190
we've,
we've done it,

1383
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:30,920
but it's not by a high percentage,
it's like because usually our no show

1384
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:33,980
percentage will be like 10 percent,
so will oversell by like five percent

1385
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:36,470
because people,
because if you have 100 people,

1386
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:39,920
10 people won't show up.
It depends on the price of the ticket.

1387
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:42,020
It depends on the act like with,
with a celebrity,

1388
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:43,760
no show percentages of virtually
nothing.

1389
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,390
But with like a typical day,
you know,

1390
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,630
at a typical,
like a,

1391
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:51,500
we call it a just funny,
someone who's good but no one has heard

1392
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:51,890
of them.

1393
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,850
Right.
You know,

1394
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,470
plenty of times some will be like,
oh yeah,

1395
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:58,310
let's get four tickets to the club and
then they only have one friend like that

1396
00:59:58,311 --> 01:00:00,410
happens all the time.
Babysitter canceled.

1397
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,640
That's true.
You know,

1398
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,650
it's too rainy out.
Someone doesn't want to go.

1399
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:05,690
There are a ton,
tons of reasons,

1400
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,720
but you can't fuck over the people that
actually paid and actually showed up.

1401
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,030
Never once,
not one time that you have extra chairs,

1402
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,990
you can just shove them in places in
case everybody shows up if we have to.

1403
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,970
But what happens is on the ticket it
very specifically says like,

1404
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:21,920
this is good until showtime.
Oh,

1405
01:00:21,921 --> 01:00:23,300
okay.
And so what happens is,

1406
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,990
even if there is,
even if the no show rate is way less

1407
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,020
than it is,
even if there's weird anomaly where the

1408
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:34,440
no show rate is like zero,
there are still people who come late and

1409
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,283
you can't come late.

1410
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,560
Yeah.
If you come late,

1411
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,200
like you might get turned away.
And we tell everyone that even if you

1412
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,180
have a ticket,
we tell everyone that if you come late

1413
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:42,930
you can get turned away.
What if you get stuck in drama?

1414
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,090
Well,
you can call.

1415
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,200
You can call and say,
hey,

1416
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:46,970
you know,
we're on our way and please hold a seat

1417
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,460
that seems reasonable.
But like that thing about it this way

1418
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,710
with Broadway,
with Broadway,

1419
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:53,100
the doors close.
Okay?

1420
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,680
First of all,
fuck Broadway,

1421
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,240
all that nonsense.
Fuck musicals and fuck plays.

1422
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,650
Okay,
we have movies now.

1423
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:03,590
I want special effects.
I don't want you talking loud.

1424
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,330
I'm with you.
I want you miked up.

1425
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,080
I want you to be able to whisper and I
want to hear it crystal clear and I'm

1426
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,350
giving you no leeway.
I'm giving you no leeway because the

1427
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:13,250
costumes are nice.

1428
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,430
Yes.
I won't plan.

1429
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,760
I want writing.
I want to fucking.

1430
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:20,300
I want new shit to want some old shit
that doesn't apply anymore.

1431
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,760
I'm okay with musicals.
I don't,

1432
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,920
you know,
I can just suspend my disbelief and go.

1433
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:26,780
Okay.
Everybody's singing fine.

1434
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,480
I mean,
but it's got to be a good song.

1435
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:31,790
It's got a further the plot.
It can't just be something that they

1436
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:32,690
know is going to sell.
Well,

1437
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,640
yeah.
I went to a musical.

1438
01:01:34,641 --> 01:01:38,450
Well I should take that back because the
book of Mormon is fucking amazing.

1439
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:39,620
Yes.
That's a musical.

1440
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:41,420
That's what I mean.
But those guys are just,

1441
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,630
they do everything right.
They just do everything right.

1442
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:48,320
But that was also Bobby Lopez who did
avenue Q.

1443
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,850
I don't know who that is.
I don't know what that is.

1444
01:01:49,851 --> 01:01:51,200
Do you don't know avenue q?
Nope.

1445
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,260
So avenue q is the other good Broadway
show in of the two.

1446
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,640
Uh,
avenue q was the one where the,

1447
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:57,600
they had songs,
uh,

1448
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,350
the Internet is for porn and everyone's
a little bit racist.

1449
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:01,470
Oh,
okay.

1450
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,480
It's cool.
So it's a good study.

1451
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:04,940
Long as it's common puppets.
Yeah,

1452
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:07,040
it was with puppets.
It was like a Broadway show with

1453
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:08,870
puppets,
like sesame street on Broadway.

1454
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,970
Hey,
whatever happened to the fucking

1455
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:14,060
spiderman Broadway show where people
kept falling on their head.

1456
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,950
Did they abandoned that?
Uh,

1457
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:16,761
it,
yeah,

1458
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:17,360
eventually,
yes.

1459
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,360
Spiderman turned off the dark eventually
turned on the dark because people were

1460
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:23,880
dying,
right.

1461
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,630
People get paralyzed and shit and they
will fell.

1462
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:27,870
So my,
my,

1463
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:31,640
uh,
my wife worked at a audience awards

1464
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,820
which is like a frequent flyer points
for Broadway and so she would go to all

1465
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:40,821
these shows and so she went to spiderman
like during the previews and she texted

1466
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:45,390
me and she goes,
one of the actors has been stuck for an

1467
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,850
hour,
like just on the rope.

1468
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,380
Oh my God.
And she just said,

1469
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,610
yeah,
he's been stuck for an hour.

1470
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:54,180
And I was like,
I bet you know how he feels like it's

1471
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,530
just,
it was her.

1472
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,770
She would go to all these shows and
eventually like I wouldn't have to go

1473
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:00,930
anymore because she took me to a
American idiot.

1474
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,540
And did you ever see that?
The Green Day One?

1475
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,970
No.
So I like Green Day.

1476
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,680
How dare you.
I,

1477
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,670
I enjoy that song specifically.
I wish Joey Diaz was here right now

1478
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,320
because he would,
he would murder milking you?

1479
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,370
Well,
I,

1480
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,790
I like,
I like the song American idiot because

1481
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:22,620
it caused people who it was about to,
to enjoy it without knowing it was about

1482
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:24,570
them.
I liked the diversity of that,

1483
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:28,950
but the musical was,
it was like when I was 30 seconds in

1484
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:30,390
before I was like,
Oh fuck this show.

1485
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:33,510
It was like watching the best painters
in the world tried to play football.

1486
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,800
It was horrific because like that's a
funny way of putting it.

1487
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:38,520
Well,
I know that,

1488
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,380
I know that like green day isn't like
real,

1489
01:03:40,430 --> 01:03:41,550
you know,
punk punk,

1490
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:44,540
but at the same time that's what the
movement it came out of and it's

1491
01:03:44,550 --> 01:03:47,130
supposed to be anti establishment and
the whole point of the show,

1492
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,250
I mean,
the Broadway thing of it basically made

1493
01:03:50,251 --> 01:03:52,800
it like everybody's just jazz hands to
fucking green.

1494
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,920
It was ridiculous.
Kind of showed what green day really is

1495
01:03:55,921 --> 01:03:58,050
all about.
Look at this green day was,

1496
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:00,840
it's,
it's a manufactured outrage.

1497
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,840
I was so disappointed because afterward
I was like,

1498
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,850
I can't believe they lend their name to
this.

1499
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:07,320
And then I looked it up and I go,
oh no,

1500
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,770
they were in charge.
It's like,

1501
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,120
that's it.
That's the end of it for me.

1502
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:15,330
That's why everybody was correct.
And I think that's one of those things

1503
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:18,210
where like people look at the,
look on that guy's say that jared from

1504
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:19,350
subway,
like who is that?

1505
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,800
Oh No,
it's Penn Jillette's younger brother,

1506
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,570
doesn't it look like?
And that wasn't even a molestation.

1507
01:04:27,571 --> 01:04:31,260
Joe Couple cigars on the far right with
the two tone hair and the conveniently

1508
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:33,240
placed tattoos.
I bet he's annoying.

1509
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,770
Yeah,
I bet.

1510
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,450
I bet.
In his last play he played like a

1511
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:38,280
salesman.
How about the guy with the flannel

1512
01:04:38,281 --> 01:04:39,960
shirt?
Is that a flannel shirt or a jacket?

1513
01:04:39,961 --> 01:04:41,910
It's a blazer.
It's a flannel blazer to.

1514
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,100
He's the drummer for green.
Yeah,

1515
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:46,760
that's Christ.
Take that picture off job.

1516
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,970
Take it off.
Yeah,

1517
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:49,290
man.
There's a lot of that stuff.

1518
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,190
You know,
it's like,

1519
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:53,790
it's like what we're talking about.
We're talking about suits coming in and

1520
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:56,280
telling you what you can and can't say.
I mean they're doing their being their

1521
01:04:56,281 --> 01:04:59,220
own suits.
They're trying to formulate something

1522
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:01,680
that they think America is going to
absorb and then they're thinking about

1523
01:05:01,681 --> 01:05:04,710
buying yachts.
So avenue q is a great show,

1524
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:10,080
but the most fun part of watching it was
watching the old Broadway people

1525
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:14,520
thinking that they're super naughty for
going to the show just like these,

1526
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:17,800
like 60,
70 year old women who like just couldn't

1527
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:18,160
believe.

1528
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,780
Like they said,
masturbation.

1529
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,550
Like just.
Yeah,

1530
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,800
that was kind of.
I had fun watching people watch it.

1531
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:25,360
Well,
if I was going to go to Broadway,

1532
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:27,260
that would be kind of why.
I would go,

1533
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:32,261
I would go to people watch the really
upper crust rich crowd of Manhattan

1534
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,410
Nights,
the people that have homes in the

1535
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,090
Hamptons,
like those people that go to all those

1536
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,760
Broadway shows and that's their social
life.

1537
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:42,160
That's what they do.
They go to parties,

1538
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,790
they dress really well,
they eat really well and they go to the

1539
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:49,150
finest restaurants in town.
They always get a table at the finest

1540
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:53,140
restaurants and here they are and it's
like that's like their hobby is being

1541
01:05:53,141 --> 01:05:57,370
rich and doing rich people things and if
you want to be cultured,

1542
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,690
you have to read the New York Times,
you have to read the New Yorker and you

1543
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:04,900
have to go to these musicals when they
come out and you have to go to Broadway.

1544
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,030
When it comes out there's a new player.
You're going to be there.

1545
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,880
Yes we are.
We have season tickets to the Broadway

1546
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:12,220
or whatever the fuck.
They have season tickets to Broadway.

1547
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,203
Yeah,
they can't.

1548
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,260
They do.
They do.

1549
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:17,250
They're like multi ticket packages.
There's a.

1550
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,350
those people have to do everything they
can to be cultured,

1551
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:22,360
except actually talk to human beings.
Well,

1552
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,760
they talked to a few human beings who
are exactly like them.

1553
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,310
Yeah.
But they don't talk to anyone who,

1554
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,390
you know what I mean?
They might,

1555
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,460
they might know their gardener's name.
Well,

1556
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,370
there's a bunch of people that are like
that,

1557
01:06:32,371 --> 01:06:35,710
that are just completely locked up and
consumption and that's the only thing

1558
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:37,960
that they can discuss.
I had this neighbor,

1559
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,410
I used to call them bling bling because
a bling bling always had,

1560
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:45,520
like everything was shiny.
He always had like expensive watches and

1561
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:47,050
they always had the nicest cars.

1562
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,970
I couldn't talk to the guy about
anything other than like cars and

1563
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:53,350
houses,
you know,

1564
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,340
like I would say,
hey man,

1565
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:55,490
how you doing?
Good.

1566
01:06:55,550 --> 01:06:56,860
Good,
good to see what that guy did.

1567
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:00,100
His house looks like Shit.
W what year is our car?

1568
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,500
Like?
That's all he would talk about while he

1569
01:07:02,501 --> 01:07:07,090
was into was consumption.
What was good for the property values?

1570
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,350
Uh,
where did you get to watch?

1571
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:08,981
Oh,
nice.

1572
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:09,890
Nice Watch.
Like,

1573
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:13,150
that was all he was into acquiring
items,

1574
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,480
moving items around fixing items,
making items better.

1575
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,000
But this was,
he was the American idiot.

1576
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:19,570
I mean,
he,

1577
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,290
he was locked into that.
I mean,

1578
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:24,870
I knew this guy for years.
I mean literally that is why I called

1579
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:25,481
them blink,
blink.

1580
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:29,200
We'd never had a conversation about
anything other than objects that he

1581
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:32,050
wanted or objects that he saw that he
liked.

1582
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,970
I mean,
it was really weird,

1583
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:35,950
but there's a lot of people like that
out there.

1584
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:37,930
Especially really rich people.
Yeah.

1585
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,040
The uh,
when people make this argument about

1586
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:42,551
like,
oh,

1587
01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:43,181
well,
you know,

1588
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:46,390
we have to allow the rich to be able to
spend their money because it's for the

1589
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:48,520
economy and that's why they shouldn't,
you know,

1590
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,230
we shouldn't have higher taxes on the
rich.

1591
01:07:50,231 --> 01:07:51,190
I'm just like DC.
How they,

1592
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,070
how they spend it.
Do you see the,

1593
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:59,300
the ridiculousness that that has been
like it's the problem with higher taxes

1594
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:01,470
on the rich,
is that like what,

1595
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:02,230
what,
what is,

1596
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,940
what's going on?
What is capitalism like?

1597
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:05,170
What is it?
Is it a game?

1598
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:06,520
And we'd try to.
I mean,

1599
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:11,200
if one person works harder and they make
more money and one person a is more

1600
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:12,730
innovative,
they're more creative,

1601
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:14,920
they figured out a way to extract more
money from the.

1602
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:15,980
Should they

1603
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,510
be penalized?
I mean,

1604
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:20,960
aren't we all trying to do that?
Are we all trying to acquire money in

1605
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:22,010
some way,
shape or form?

1606
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:26,630
And who is to say that one person,
some Bill Gates type guy is better at it

1607
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:30,680
so they should be penalized.
Like it seems like you're trying to rig

1608
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:33,890
the game because someone has just way
fucking better at it.

1609
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,160
Well,
I think the problem is that it's not.

1610
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,810
I don't have a problem with people who
are better at it.

1611
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:42,290
I have a problem with the people who are
the grandson of the person who was

1612
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,340
better at it.
Exactly.

1613
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:45,680
That was just,
just the idea of like,

1614
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,543
oh,
you know,

1615
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,830
my uh,
my father's father's sperm was real

1616
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:51,770
innovative.
The Heinz account has always had good

1617
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:53,060
merit here.
Yeah.

1618
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,190
Yeah.
That kind of stuff.

1619
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,890
I inherited some.
Money's a,

1620
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:59,360
that's a tricky one.
I don't think it's bad for the people

1621
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:00,200
that get it.

1622
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,640
Yeah.
I look at the,

1623
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:02,990
uh,
um,

1624
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:06,050
I look at the people who,
there's that quote that I forget where

1625
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:08,000
it's from,
but that quote that America is a nation

1626
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:12,710
of temporarily embarrassed millionaires
that like everyone thinks that they're a

1627
01:09:12,711 --> 01:09:14,810
millionaire there just going through
hard times right now.

1628
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:15,920
I get it.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,780
Yeah.
Well that's one of the reasons why poor

1630
01:09:17,781 --> 01:09:19,500
people vote for Republicans.
Yeah.

1631
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,860
They really think,
well,

1632
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,900
you need business new businesses who is
more anti poor people than Republicans,

1633
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,810
but how many poor people wind up being
conservative?

1634
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:32,030
It's like,
what I want to say to those people is

1635
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,721
like,
I get,

1636
01:09:32,721 --> 01:09:34,040
you know,
we all want to be millionaires.

1637
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:36,470
We all want to be successful and that's
wonderful and we need a path to get

1638
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:38,360
there and that's fantastic.
But tell me this,

1639
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,550
when you were 55 and you were working at
applebee's,

1640
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,630
what the fuck is your path?

1641
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,720
Where from here to there?
You tell me.

1642
01:09:44,721 --> 01:09:46,310
You tell me what app you're going to
invent.

1643
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,290
You tell me what you know you're going
to win on American idol as the old lady

1644
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:55,580
like you tell me how the fuck are you
going to go from the lowest tax bracket

1645
01:09:55,730 --> 01:10:00,110
to the highest one when you're already
55 and your dream has gone,

1646
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,890
but it can happen.
See to say that it's kind of silly

1647
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:06,560
because we've.
There's been a million stories about

1648
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,700
like someone who writes a book in their
fifties and they become rich.

1649
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:14,270
I mean all that stuff has happened.
It's just a matter of you,

1650
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,070
but you have to do it.
Whatever it is,

1651
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:18,290
you have to do it.
If you're actually just taking all your

1652
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:21,200
time and you're staying at applebee's
and then you're drinking and then you

1653
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:22,640
watch the TV and any falling asleep.

1654
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:24,110
That pattern.
Yeah.

1655
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:26,990
If that person said to me while I've
been working on this novel for a very

1656
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:29,480
long time and I have a lot of faith in
and I've sent it to a lot of publishers

1657
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:30,920
and you know what?
I've been rejected a lot of times,

1658
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:33,320
but I'm not going to take no for an
answer and going to pound the pavement

1659
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,060
and where to find it.
Maybe I'll self publish at my,

1660
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:35,841
you know,
and I'll,

1661
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:37,510
and I'll walk around and I'll go to
libraries.

1662
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,170
You know what?
And I'll,

1663
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:40,610
I'll get my book in libraries and,
and if they said all that,

1664
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,444
I'd be like,
you know what?

1665
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,730
Don't pay taxes.
Yes.

1666
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,890
Vote Republican.
Yes.

1667
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,990
But if they're just like,
well,

1668
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:48,920
you know,
my,

1669
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:50,990
my brother's got this idea,
right?

1670
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,020
My brother's got this idea,
now it,

1671
01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:55,160
he just needs a little bit of seed
money.

1672
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:58,100
It's a little bit of seed money.
That person.

1673
01:10:58,101 --> 01:10:59,510
I'm just like,
I don't understand why you're voting

1674
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:01,100
against your own best interest.
Well,

1675
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:03,650
I don't think they think they are.
They think that people are lazy.

1676
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,810
I work hard.
Got Damn Lazy People.

1677
01:11:05,811 --> 01:11:08,120
They want that welfare money.
They're going to take that welfare.

1678
01:11:08,121 --> 01:11:09,790
Just spend it on cigarettes.
Yeah.

1679
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,260
Well,
the,

1680
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,770
the uh,
I love during,

1681
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,100
during

1682
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,750
the a debt,
you know,

1683
01:11:15,751 --> 01:11:18,090
the recession,
the collapse when everybody was talking

1684
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:19,650
about like,
I don't like how the government spends

1685
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,660
my money,
like the government spends money on

1686
01:11:21,661 --> 01:11:22,980
things they can't afford.
I'm like,

1687
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:25,290
you just lost your house in your car
because you bought something you

1688
01:11:25,291 --> 01:11:26,124
couldn't afford.

1689
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,920
Yeah.
But they thought they could afford it.

1690
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:29,150
Right.
Just stupid.

1691
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,210
Like the problem with those goddamn
mortgages,

1692
01:11:32,211 --> 01:11:32,841
man.
Yeah.

1693
01:11:32,841 --> 01:11:36,830
That was the craziest Ponzi scheme ever.
That you would have someone with an

1694
01:11:36,831 --> 01:11:40,010
adjustable rate mortgage and all of a
sudden the rate gets jacked up through

1695
01:11:40,011 --> 01:11:41,870
the roof and you're paying three times
as much.

1696
01:11:41,871 --> 01:11:43,580
Like,
what did I sign up for?

1697
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,010
Wait a minute.
I was only paying $1,500 a month and now

1698
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,830
I'm paying 15,000.

1699
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:52,830
There is,
there is a great deal of deception and

1700
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,910
fraud and garbage that was done from the
banks and from the people in charge.

1701
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,670
But there was also a great deal of
people just didn't want to do their

1702
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:00,710
homework and they just,
yeah,

1703
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,630
they heard something too good to be true
and they didn't know the lesson of if

1704
01:12:03,631 --> 01:12:05,850
it's too good to be true,
it's not true.

1705
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:06,990
Yeah,
definitely.

1706
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,750
It's the same people who like,
they'll open up the email,

1707
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:10,590
they'll be like,
what?

1708
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,390
What do you,
what do you mean I got this email,

1709
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:14,430
we're all,
I get all this money.

1710
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,830
I just click on this link right here
from this person I never met.

1711
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:21,330
Like how do you not know?
The first time I saw that I was like,

1712
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:23,910
this looks wrong.
Well you're a smart Guy Steve.

1713
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,900
But that's what I'm saying.
Like there's people,

1714
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:28,500
they're dumb.
It's so difficult.

1715
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:30,970
So lonely.

1716
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,200
The top of Olympus.
Well,

1717
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:35,460
one of the things we were talking about
earlier about debt and about people with

1718
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:37,360
credit card debt that they don't realize
it.

1719
01:12:37,361 --> 01:12:40,300
And if you had money,
I cash money and you wouldn't,

1720
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:43,330
you wouldn't be so likely to go into
debt with cash.

1721
01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,190
Yeah.
Well I think that's the same thing with

1722
01:12:45,191 --> 01:12:48,190
the environment.
I think the environment is almost like

1723
01:12:48,191 --> 01:12:52,150
credit because it's like throwing
garbage out the window and no one's

1724
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:55,090
thinking about it.
We're burning fossil fuels and fucking

1725
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:58,710
spraying hairspray into this guy.
No one's thinking about what that's

1726
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,050
doing because we don't feel it instantly
and immediately.

1727
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:05,470
We don't have like a vault.
We open up shit.

1728
01:13:05,471 --> 01:13:07,020
I'm out of air.
You know,

1729
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,490
I'm running low
on fish left.

1730
01:13:10,870 --> 01:13:12,190
Yeah,
we don't feel it.

1731
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:16,270
So we continue to act in the exact same
way because we're not really getting the

1732
01:13:16,271 --> 01:13:17,290
feedback.
You know,

1733
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:18,880
you watch an inconvenient truth.
You went,

1734
01:13:18,881 --> 01:13:20,110
well,
that's Kinda fucked up.

1735
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,640
Oh God.
I get to work in the morning,

1736
01:13:21,641 --> 01:13:22,600
click,
shut it off,

1737
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,010
go to bed.
She abb up,

1738
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:27,310
wake up,
keep going.

1739
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:31,570
And that's a pattern that just kept,
keeps getting repeated and repeated and

1740
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:34,510
we're not feeling the feedback of the
negative actions.

1741
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:37,900
I was uh,
I was flying and it was during that

1742
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:42,760
crazy winter with a polar vortex stuff
where it was like negative two degrees

1743
01:13:42,761 --> 01:13:45,550
and a lot of places and it got down to
like negative 20 in the Midwest.

1744
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,200
What year was that?
Two years ago.

1745
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,430
I think two,
three years ago,

1746
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:49,930
yeah,
it was a,

1747
01:13:49,931 --> 01:13:51,670
I know in La we're just like,
yeah,

1748
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:53,680
got all the way down to 55.
It was terrible.

1749
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,840
And so,
um,

1750
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:56,471
I,
yeah,

1751
01:13:56,471 --> 01:13:58,240
I got woken up by the bells of the ice
cream truck.

1752
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:00,520
It was really a difficult winter,
but the,

1753
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:02,230
um,
but so I'm,

1754
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:03,700
I'm flying somewhere and there's this
guy,

1755
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:06,040
you know,
going through a in front of me and Tsa

1756
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,031
and,
you know,

1757
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:08,980
he's taking off his coat and all that
stuff.

1758
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:12,190
And Tsa got a cold,
isn't it one of these small

1759
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,830
airports where they all went to high
school together and uh,

1760
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:18,750
and the guy goes so much for global
warming and I,

1761
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:22,090
I need to leave well enough alone.
I need to learn how to do that.

1762
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:23,680
But I was just like,
I was like,

1763
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,191
oh,
actually,

1764
01:14:24,191 --> 01:14:25,840
you know,
global warming also makes it colder in

1765
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:26,870
the winter.
The Jews,

1766
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,100
he knew right away.
And uh,

1767
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:33,791
yeah,
he just,

1768
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,500
immediately he was,
he just what he,

1769
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:37,900
his reaction actually was one of my
favorite things anyone's ever said.

1770
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:39,880
He just goes,
that's what they want you to believe.

1771
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,250
Oh,
like they do because they're scientists

1772
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,840
and they want you to believe them.
Well,

1773
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:47,650
Sam Harris was talking about this
yesterday that trump is a global warming

1774
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:48,550
denier.
Yeah.

1775
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:53,230
Global warming denier is really close to
being the president of United States.

1776
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,630
He's not only is he global warming
denier,

1777
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,660
but the good news is if he felt he would
make money off of it,

1778
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,800
he would believe in global warming.

1779
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,120
Oh yeah.
For sure.

1780
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,940
There's no platform.
He can't believe him.

1781
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,690
Wonder what the thought process behind
that is.

1782
01:15:04,691 --> 01:15:08,290
Just plow straight ahead and just do
whatever's good for you and don't give a

1783
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:11,550
fuck or is there like.
It's narcissism tists.

1784
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,630
We'll figure it out.
Yeah,

1785
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:13,570
for sure.
Right.

1786
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:15,130
That's really what it was answered my
own question.

1787
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,080
I think it's.
I think it's A.

1788
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,190
Yeah,
it's what you were saying.

1789
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:23,191
The idea of like planning ahead and not
know like I have this thing where it

1790
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:26,860
bothers me when someone's unhappy.
Like Jane,

1791
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,710
when I can see on happiness,
whether someone's mad at me about

1792
01:15:29,711 --> 01:15:32,860
something I did or just someone's sad,
like immediately I'm like,

1793
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,030
I have to fix this.
You know,

1794
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:35,680
like,
I don't know what that's from,

1795
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,510
I don't know how I got that way and I
try to get over it to a degree.

1796
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:43,870
I like being compassionate,
but I also don't want it to like totally

1797
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:47,960
ruined me and I think that there are
people who are wired and completely the

1798
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:52,270
other direction who they can walk by,
someone bleeding to death and just be

1799
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:52,990
like,
ugh.

1800
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,990
The sidewalk used to be so much nicer.
Yeah.

1801
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:00,850
Yeah.
I guess that's probably like the type of

1802
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:04,000
person that you don't want an office.
Yes.

1803
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,700
Yes.
That's the exact type of person you

1804
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:08,710
don't put no,
but you also don't want the type of

1805
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:11,920
person in the office is constantly
worried about people being sad because

1806
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:15,220
then you'll never get anything done
because it's 300 million people and at

1807
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:17,320
least 30 million of them are satisfied.
Fuck,

1808
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,150
right.
The least.

1809
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,540
I can look at statistics being sad all
day with no problem.

1810
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,190
Oh,
statistics don't fuck with you.

1811
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,490
It's actually humans.
It's,

1812
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,910
it's the interaction with humans.
What about puppies?

1813
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,470
I'm a big dog rescue guy.
Oh,

1814
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,530
me too.
So I actually go to the fucking.

1815
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,210
I can't go.
I'll take them all.

1816
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,170
Dude.
On this past,

1817
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,200
on this past tour I did in 10 days.
In 10 days I stopped and got for strays.

1818
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,700
I didn't keep them,
but I like helped rescue for sure in 10

1819
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:46,660
days.
Just driving around.

1820
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,360
We found them on the street for strays
in 10 days.

1821
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,070
You know,
they were actually straight.

1822
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:52,630
I didn't know.
People don't just like let their dogs

1823
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:53,590
out,
the dogs come back.

1824
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,090
I used to have a dog like that.
Well,

1825
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,480
one of them was,
if it hadn't come back,

1826
01:16:58,481 --> 01:17:00,230
I mean if it was laid out,
it had been a couple of days,

1827
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:01,630
like it was like mad it up and
everything.

1828
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:05,140
I'm,
one of them was actually someone who

1829
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,530
like was someone who just keeps their
door open and then their was just

1830
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,370
playing in traffic

1831
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,940
and.
But thankfully it to end,

1832
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,580
he comes out and he goes,
I've been looking for him and I just go

1833
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:20,870
where
you can a shit.

1834
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,700
Where's the dog?
Uh,

1835
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:27,080
the third one was one who was,
I don't think she's ever been owned.

1836
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:30,590
It was just on the streets of Louisville
and just walking around near the airport

1837
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,580
and then the fourth one was actually one
where this was the one that made me the

1838
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:38,840
most upset because leash and collar
right outside of a dog grooming place.

1839
01:17:38,841 --> 01:17:39,561
So I'm like,
Oh shit.

1840
01:17:39,561 --> 01:17:43,070
One got out and so this is in Phoenix
and I'm running around.

1841
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:46,730
It's 95 degree heat and this dog is fast
and I'm like running around trying to

1842
01:17:46,731 --> 01:17:50,300
chase it.
And finally there's this alcove in the

1843
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:52,220
shopping center where it goes in the
alcove and I'm like,

1844
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:53,150
great.
It'll be cornered.

1845
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:54,380
I'll finally be able to get it.

1846
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,500
And so I go in there and there's like a
woman with a stroller and I go,

1847
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:59,180
Hey,
do you see a stray dog run by here?

1848
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,800
And then I see the dog in the corner and
I go,

1849
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:01,730
oh,
it's right there.

1850
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,520
And she goes,
that's my dog because that's your dog.

1851
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:06,680
I've been chasing it for 20 minutes
through a parking lot.

1852
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:08,390
It almost got hit by three different
cars.

1853
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,440
And she goes,
Oh,

1854
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:11,420
did it?
Like,

1855
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:13,220
yeah.
That's what happens when dogs run around

1856
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,930
parking lots.
When people have strollers,

1857
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:17,750
they don't give a fuck about their dog.
I'm concerned,

1858
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,020
concerned with this little baby,
this dog and go fuck itself.

1859
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,660
I just think like,
how hard is it to take that leash and

1860
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:26,040
just tie it to the bench that you're
sitting on it.

1861
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,120
It's hard for some people just like,
it's hard to not hold the baby over the

1862
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,170
grill enclosure.
Very difficult.

1863
01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:35,180
So that compels soon is real.
The struggle is real.

1864
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,980
Be Like I've,
you know,

1865
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:38,630
I really,
I really don't want to let this dog go.

1866
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,750
What am I,
my favorite dogs ever.

1867
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,530
I got a call from these people that I
knew they were a dog watchers and uh,

1868
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,940
they found a dog in their neighborhood
and they knew that I had dogs and the

1869
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:51,400
new,
I love dogs and this dog had mange.

1870
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:55,750
She had mange all over her body.
She was really sick and they were like,

1871
01:18:55,751 --> 01:18:58,930
we don't even know if,
if she's going to be able to make it

1872
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:02,440
like so fucked,
like open scabs because of it.

1873
01:19:02,441 --> 01:19:05,980
She was so beat up.
It was so sad and so they had washed her

1874
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:08,740
up and they had fed her and she was a
really sweet dog and I'm like,

1875
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:09,490
look,
I,

1876
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:11,260
I'll take a chance.
We'll see what happens.

1877
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,910
Yeah.
Within like a week,

1878
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:14,980
her manager had grown back.
It was crazy.

1879
01:19:14,981 --> 01:19:17,710
It's just the food.
She's needed to be cleaned and needed

1880
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:20,440
food within a week.
Almost all of her hair was like,

1881
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:23,440
it wasn't fully grown.
It was all growing back and she turned

1882
01:19:23,441 --> 01:19:28,441
out to be the greatest dog of all time,
but I can't go around those dogs.

1883
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:32,380
I'll have a fucking house full of dogs.
I have 100 dogs.

1884
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,610
The one I have now,
I did not plan on having him.

1885
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:37,400
I saw him in a shelter and he was just
the cutest thing and,

1886
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:41,670
and I,
I fostered him and two days in like we

1887
01:19:41,671 --> 01:19:44,900
are someone like messaged me because I
made like an instagram account forum so

1888
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:46,490
that like maybe we'll get popular and
people,

1889
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:50,450
someone would adopt him and then someone
messaged me and immediately I got the

1890
01:19:50,451 --> 01:19:52,160
message and I was thinking like,
don't you take my dog

1891
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,610
was mine.
So He's,

1892
01:19:55,790 --> 01:20:00,230
he's a Staffordshire bull terrier,
which is basically like a pit bull.

1893
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,100
Yeah.
It's like a,

1894
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,930
I call it a pit bull face on a pig's
body.

1895
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:07,530
It's like he's adorable.
And he like,

1896
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,070
what's crazy is so that breed,
if you were to buy one,

1897
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:16,380
they're $2,500 and that's one without
training,

1898
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,200
without anything like.
And he was just sitting in a shelter and

1899
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:20,970
so anytime someone's like,
oh well you know,

1900
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:23,370
I've got to go to a shelter because I
need to really specific or sorry,

1901
01:20:23,371 --> 01:20:25,500
I gotta go to a breeder because I needed
a really specific dog.

1902
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:28,470
I'm just like put their out there.
Anything you want.

1903
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,430
Every single kind of dog is out there.
And he's my mascot now I take them with

1904
01:20:32,431 --> 01:20:33,740
me to comedy clubs and everything.
Really?

1905
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:35,280
Yeah.
Because he doesn't bark at all.

1906
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:37,770
I've heard him bark maybe like 10 times.
Oh that's awesome.

1907
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:39,450
So I just,
he hangs out in the greenroom.

1908
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:40,950
Uh,
he like,

1909
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:43,200
he'll find like whatever comic,
like left,

1910
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:47,130
like a box of like merge,
like sometimes someone will ship merged

1911
01:20:47,131 --> 01:20:48,960
or something.
He'll just find like the box of shirts

1912
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:51,330
and just like use it as a bed.
He's great.

1913
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:53,580
He's smart.
He knows they're useless.

1914
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:55,180
Yeah.
Yeah,

1915
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:55,890
man.
Um,

1916
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,940
shelters are tough.

1917
01:20:57,130 --> 01:20:58,600
It's tough.
It's tough to go there.

1918
01:20:58,601 --> 01:21:02,260
It's tough to see that.
It's just the people are so

1919
01:21:02,261 --> 01:21:05,230
irresponsible there.
So irresponsible with pads they get and

1920
01:21:05,231 --> 01:21:07,270
we can't have this dog dog shit in the
house.

1921
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,690
Like you got to teach them to not shit
in the house next to just give them up

1922
01:21:10,691 --> 01:21:12,430
and leave him in a cage and out of
sight,

1923
01:21:12,431 --> 01:21:14,320
out of mind.
Go on with their life.

1924
01:21:14,650 --> 01:21:17,990
What disturbed me is when I found out
how many animals Peta kills everything

1925
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:19,410
year.
Oh,

1926
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,260
I got into it with the pita.
A spokesperson on twitter.

1927
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:23,340
Did you?
Oh,

1928
01:21:23,341 --> 01:21:24,330
I fucked her up.
Good.

1929
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:28,470
I was pretty happy with those at about.
So she followed me on twitter and I just

1930
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:29,520
write back and I go,
Hey,

1931
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,870
I'm,
I'm so honored for the follow sincere

1932
01:21:31,890 --> 01:21:33,510
the Peta spokesperson.
I'm,

1933
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,150
could you let me know why Peter has a 90
percent kill rate?

1934
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,850
And so she starts doing,
you know,

1935
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,560
the standard pr thing of like,
well,

1936
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,630
you know,
people bring dogs to us that,

1937
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,460
you know,
don't really have much of a chance

1938
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:45,870
elsewhere.
And so,

1939
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:47,340
you know,
we're kind of a last resort.

1940
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:48,540
And I go,
Oh,

1941
01:21:48,541 --> 01:21:49,140
well,
uh,

1942
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:52,740
that's actually not true because I know
of shelters that are like that and their

1943
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:56,180
kill rate is one 10th of yours.
So if you could explain it.

1944
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:59,220
And I just kept hammering her about and
hammered her about it and hammer

1945
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:00,400
lightly,
um,

1946
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,280
calmly.
I wasn't like,

1947
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:04,590
shut up bitch like this,
that gets you nowhere,

1948
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,660
you know,
I was just trying to outwit her and it

1949
01:22:06,661 --> 01:22:07,950
was a,
it was a lot of fun.

1950
01:22:07,951 --> 01:22:09,150
And eventually then she's like,
look,

1951
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:10,590
I don't speak for Peta.
And I was like,

1952
01:22:10,591 --> 01:22:11,550
well,
in your bio,

1953
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,760
on your twitter it says head of
communications.

1954
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,680
So,
uh,

1955
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,990
you do,
and now you're speaking to me.

1956
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:23,030
Is it a resource issue as PD does not
have the money to take Carolyn?

1957
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:25,980
It's actually a batman issue.
Um,

1958
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,310
you know,
how like ratio goal pause.

1959
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,220
Yeah.
You know,

1960
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,250
how,
how the idea of like in a,

1961
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:38,150
in the first Christian Bale Batman,
a racial goal was kind of like who's

1962
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,911
that?
Okay,

1963
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:41,070
so the,
the bad guy in Bama and they were like,

1964
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,080
we need to save the city by destroying
it,

1965
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:44,640
right?
Like the humans are destroying

1966
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:47,190
themselves,
so we're going to wipe this out and,

1967
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:50,730
and so that'll prevent the problem and
that's what it is.

1968
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,870
Peta is basically like,
there's a problem with like,

1969
01:22:54,871 --> 01:22:58,620
we love these dogs and so to stop them
from overbreeding we're just going to

1970
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:01,320
murder a lot of them.
Like that's where they go with it.

1971
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:06,310
We'll see the head of Peta when you get
to the top crazy person,

1972
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,091
it's,
well,

1973
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:09,000
it's not murdered for saying this.
No,

1974
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,510
you shouldn't be.
If they do,

1975
01:23:10,511 --> 01:23:14,320
they're rude animal liberation
organization.

1976
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:14,890
The,
the,

1977
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:17,890
the real,
the at the very head of a lot of these

1978
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:20,800
really radical animal rights movements.
And by the way,

1979
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:25,801
I love animals so I get it.
I get the wanting pets to be taken care

1980
01:23:27,281 --> 01:23:28,930
of,
but they don't want pets to be taken

1981
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:30,280
care of.
They don't want pets.

1982
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:33,310
They think animals should be free,
all animals should be free.

1983
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:35,440
All livestock,
all pets,

1984
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,510
none of that should be real.
All animals.

1985
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:39,730
She just existed in some sort of a wild
state.

1986
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,340
They also,
uh,

1987
01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:45,510
she's gone on the record many,
many times talking about how people

1988
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,060
should be eradicated.
Yeah.

1989
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:48,120
And you know,
and,

1990
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,820
and like things like that and the idea
that they are dangerous.

1991
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:53,890
I've had them,
they just are,

1992
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,560
you know,
there are thousands of years of breeding

1993
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:58,900
to fight each other and if you're
irresponsible,

1994
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:01,390
dog owner,
pitbulls can be fucking dangerous.

1995
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,350
Yeah.
But at the same time,

1996
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:04,570
they say that about my dog,
about my staffy.

1997
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,220
Yeah.
But staffordshires terrorists.

1998
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,470
That's ignorance.
They're not the same breed.

1999
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,300
See,
there's a genetic according to law.

2000
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:11,540
They are.
Yeah,

2001
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:13,690
but that's not.
It's not right.

2002
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:16,150
The law is incorrect.
It's just some stuff written down on

2003
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:19,120
paper when you deal with the actual
genetic lines of the dog.

2004
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,150
I've had dogs that were,
there,

2005
01:24:21,151 --> 01:24:24,130
were there.
The line was from fighting dogs and they

2006
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:26,770
were impossible.
He couldn't take them to the dog park,

2007
01:24:26,771 --> 01:24:28,480
couldn't take them.
It didn't matter how much I trained

2008
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:29,380
them,
they much how I,

2009
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:33,220
how much I was with them all the time.
When dogs had blow up around them,

2010
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:35,820
he would get aggressive and he want to
fight while night.

2011
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:37,960
I agree with you on a lot of things,
but this is.

2012
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,940
This is one where where I have a
completely different line because like I

2013
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:46,941
have a dog who is Chihuahua Basset Hound
and I can't bring her nero that dogs,

2014
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,880
but that's an exception to the rule.

2015
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:53,330
Pit Bulls are kind of the rule.
The problem with pitbulls is if you get.

2016
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:56,050
It's a very dangerous dog.
They're super powerful.

2017
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:57,880
They're really aggressive and they
don't.

2018
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:02,680
They don't respond to pain the way a lot
of other dogs do because it's been bred

2019
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,590
out of them.
Like if you follow the way they breed

2020
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:08,080
dogs for fighting.
When dogs fight,

2021
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,690
if they back away,
if they cower,

2022
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:13,440
they were killed.
That was the whole Michael Vick thing is

2023
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:16,630
that it killed all these dogs that quit
in fights.

2024
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:21,810
So when you have all of that
reinforcement genetically and you're

2025
01:25:22,481 --> 01:25:27,280
dealing with a breed that's been raised
like this for hundreds and hundreds of

2026
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:30,640
generations,
you're dealing with an incredibly

2027
01:25:30,641 --> 01:25:34,150
aggressive draw a dog with a really high
kill drive.

2028
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:39,070
And when these dogs with high prey drive
or given to irresponsible people,

2029
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,500
that's when you're getting all babies
getting killed.

2030
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:43,810
Little kids getting killed,
getting killed.

2031
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:48,700
I mean it is breed specific,
but I mean that's also the same train of

2032
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:49,840
thought that people,
you know,

2033
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:51,790
I,
if you can put on a powdered wig and say

2034
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:55,720
that about quote unquote the Negro.
No you couldn't because they weren't

2035
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:59,350
bred for fighting and killing.
If you bred a bunch of people just for

2036
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:00,700
fighting and killing.
Yeah,

2037
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:04,430
you can make that distinction.
But pit bulls bred for fighting.

2038
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:07,400
I mean that's the.
That's what they were bred for.

2039
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,800
That's why they look that way.
I mean,

2040
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:12,500
this is a thing that's been recent
though.

2041
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,350
They used to be used in hundreds of
generations.

2042
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:16,310
It's not that recent.
I mean they used to be,

2043
01:26:16,311 --> 01:26:18,200
you know,
the PIPA was America sweetheart.

2044
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

2045
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,670
The PD from the little rascals had the
pip,

2046
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:23,533
you know,
whatever it was,

2047
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,570
but the was almost America's mascot by
the way.

2048
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,070
Before the Eagle.
Yeah.

2049
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,310
The eye.
And I think the problem is also is that

2050
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:35,270
if a dog looks like a pitfall because
people actually isn't even a breed.

2051
01:26:35,271 --> 01:26:36,590
It's a,
what is it,

2052
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:40,820
American something terrier.
I'm is the actual breed that people are

2053
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:41,481
talking about.
Well,

2054
01:26:41,481 --> 01:26:44,990
it was an American bulldog mixed with a
terrier.

2055
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:48,440
Terriers are more aggressive and then
they made the new breed.

2056
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:49,340
Yeah.
And then.

2057
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,150
But if you get a blood line from one
that is a fighting dog,

2058
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,610
and this is not someone I'd love
pitbulls.

2059
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,260
I have friends that have pit bull.
I love them.

2060
01:26:57,261 --> 01:26:59,450
They're the sweetest,
most friendly dog,

2061
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,570
but if handled correctly,
they still have a problem being

2062
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:05,060
aggressive with other dogs.
A lot of them do.

2063
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,940
Yeah.
And they're really powerful dogs and in

2064
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:09,630
the hands of the wrong people,
it's.

2065
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,660
We're not talking about labs.
Okay.

2066
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,990
We have a lab.
Labs are like universally loving and

2067
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:17,090
nice.
You can get the exception to the rule.

2068
01:27:17,091 --> 01:27:20,900
You get a bad lab,
but overall Labrador retrievers are

2069
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:23,120
really friendly,
easy going dogs,

2070
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:25,220
so when someone has a lab you go,
oh,

2071
01:27:25,221 --> 01:27:27,140
he's got a lap.
When someone has a pit bull,

2072
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:29,300
there's a fucking reason why people go,
oh great.

2073
01:27:29,301 --> 01:27:32,720
He's got a pit bull because a lot of
them are fucking crazy a lot.

2074
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:37,070
Well there and I think it.
I think it boils down to who is handling

2075
01:27:37,071 --> 01:27:39,710
the dog and the idea of if you.

2076
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:42,050
I like,
I hate when someone is like,

2077
01:27:42,051 --> 01:27:43,490
I'm thinking of getting a pimple.
It's like,

2078
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,770
well,
either you need to know everything about

2079
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:48,090
it and then you get one or you don't
what?

2080
01:27:48,091 --> 01:27:50,600
You have to have a yard that contained
that dog for sure.

2081
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,140
You have to be on top of it.
When it comes to training,

2082
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,820
you have to really be aware.
You have to read books on it.

2083
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:58,910
You should probably seek help with the
professional,

2084
01:27:58,911 --> 01:28:02,090
the behavioral specialist with dogs,
but even then,

2085
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:05,240
if some dog threatens your dog or
grounds or on your dog,

2086
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:08,000
it's likely that your dog's going to
clamp ahold of it's neck.

2087
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:11,780
That dog's going to get fucked up,
but that's also why I'm a huge proponent

2088
01:28:11,781 --> 01:28:13,220
of leash laws.
I think by the way,

2089
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:18,200
if la fuck these parking tickets,
leash laws like you and you enforce

2090
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:21,470
leash laws and we will,
we will have more money than any city in

2091
01:28:21,471 --> 01:28:22,040
the world.

2092
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:22,873
Right?
Yeah.

2093
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,910
Well,
I guess how many people really walk

2094
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:28,250
around with your dog without a leash?
Is that really a problem?

2095
01:28:28,340 --> 01:28:29,480
I,
I couldn't.

2096
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:33,020
I don't know if I've ever walked my dog
without running into someone who had an

2097
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,580
off leash dog.
Yeah,

2098
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,100
that's irresponsible.
Let's turn on a trail or something like

2099
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:37,650
that.
I had,

2100
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:41,300
but even then I had a.
So I was walking my dogs on this trail

2101
01:28:41,301 --> 01:28:45,470
on a leash park in,
I think it was fryman and uh,

2102
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,540
these two huge dogs come bounding at us,
right?

2103
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:51,260
And now look,
maybe they playful.

2104
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,530
One of mine's not,
one of mine is fucking terror when it

2105
01:28:54,531 --> 01:28:57,170
comes to other dogs.
And so immediately we pick them up and

2106
01:28:57,171 --> 01:29:00,370
this lady starts lecturing us about how
you're not socializing your dog's

2107
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:01,980
correctly and they'll never learn.
And

2108
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,640
I was like,
well,

2109
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,580
if you want my dog to bite your dog,
I can put her back down if you'd like.

2110
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,280
But like that's why learn.
Yeah.

2111
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,530
People who,
whose lives are a mess.

2112
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,270
Always love correcting people.
Yeah.

2113
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,000
I called to get your shit together.
I call it a incorrect,

2114
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:17,160
incorrect.
It's like,

2115
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,100
thanks for correcting me.
Yeah.

2116
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,880
You need to socialize your dog.
What?

2117
01:29:20,881 --> 01:29:22,710
First of all,
it's a little dog that you can pick up

2118
01:29:22,711 --> 01:29:25,830
and big dogs running around.
Probably should pick them up.

2119
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,110
Yeah.
Dogs like to bite little dogs.

2120
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,490
They,
they do it all the time.

2121
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:31,150
Yeah.
It still looks like a raw,

2122
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:33,930
especially if it's the wrong kind of
dog,

2123
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,160
you know,
like huskies,

2124
01:29:35,170 --> 01:29:36,760
all skeezer,
Akitas,

2125
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,190
you know,
like real aggressive dogs.

2126
01:29:38,270 --> 01:29:40,140
There are so many people.
There was one in my,

2127
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,220
uh,
in my old neighborhood.

2128
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:44,490
We're walking our dogs and all of a
sudden his dog comes charging at us and

2129
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:45,390
it was like a little dog.

2130
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,620
And so we pick our,
our dogs and my wife feels lease your

2131
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:51,870
damn dog.
And the guy goes,

2132
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:54,090
this is a public space.
And I go,

2133
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:56,670
yeah,
that's why you lease your dunk.

2134
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:59,820
But where was this?
Just a little lawn of an apartment

2135
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:00,940
complex.
Oh,

2136
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:02,270
you know,
like just a,

2137
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:03,980
just a place where people walk the dogs
all the time.

2138
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,630
Do you believe unleashing your dogs on
trails and stuff too?

2139
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:08,660
Like when you're in parks and.
Uh,

2140
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:11,910
I mean if it is a non unleashed place,
then that's fine.

2141
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,440
If it's at least place.
The problem is,

2142
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:16,980
is that if someone's dog's leash and
someone's dog isn't leashed that's a bad

2143
01:30:16,981 --> 01:30:20,480
way for them to me because one dog feels
trapped and.

2144
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,230
Right.
So it's about expectation.

2145
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:25,110
So if I know that they're gonna be non
leashed dogs there,

2146
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:27,390
I'm fine because I know I'm prepared and
I'm ready,

2147
01:30:27,391 --> 01:30:28,021
you know,
and the,

2148
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:29,730
and the dog's prepared and et Cetera.

2149
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:32,370
But if like all of a sudden the dog just
comes out of the woods,

2150
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:33,860
like,
that's not,

2151
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,970
that's not safe.
Yeah,

2152
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:37,830
that's true.
They're not robots,

2153
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,540
you know,
they're not.

2154
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,270
Well,
there's so much variety in the way dogs

2155
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:45,150
behave and the way dogs treat other dogs
and other people.

2156
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:46,490
It's just,
it's always like,

2157
01:30:46,530 --> 01:30:48,360
what's this dog like,
here comes the dog,

2158
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:49,650
what are we dealing with?
Yeah,

2159
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:50,750
exactly.
Yeah.

2160
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,890
I have no idea.
And I know that like even when I stopped

2161
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:55,170
for them on the road,
I know that's dangerous to do because

2162
01:30:55,171 --> 01:30:58,170
you have no idea if that dog is going to
like try to bite you.

2163
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,640
But I've been bit.
I haven't.

2164
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:00,751
Um,
yeah.

2165
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:02,550
I keep a,
I keep a slip lead in the car.

2166
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:06,060
I'm constantly keep an eye just have to
slowly to my trunk.

2167
01:31:06,061 --> 01:31:08,820
Wow.
I've seen so many of them and I can't

2168
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:12,000
tell you how many times I'm like,
I wish I had something to run this.

2169
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:14,070
And when you capture them then when you
put them in your car,

2170
01:31:14,071 --> 01:31:16,110
what do you do?
You just bring them right to a shelter a

2171
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:19,920
well so far I actually have not had that
happen.

2172
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:23,550
Usually it is either like one time there
was someone else there that happened to

2173
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:25,980
work for rescue that also stopped,
uh,

2174
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:28,260
you know,
one time there was a like a pet store

2175
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:30,150
right nearby.
So I kinda like brought the dog into the

2176
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,000
pet store and they were able to hold him
while a while.

2177
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,960
You know,
the owner came,

2178
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:36,360
Huh?
So I actually haven't,

2179
01:31:36,361 --> 01:31:36,991
but.
Oh No.

2180
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:37,890
You know,
the one time,

2181
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:38,670
yeah,
I brought,

2182
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:40,950
I brought a dog to in Louisville.
I brought a dog to a shelter.

2183
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:42,210
Uh,
the one that,

2184
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,310
uh,
this past week where like I put her in

2185
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:47,220
the car and then I had to be super
careful and disinfect everything because

2186
01:31:47,221 --> 01:31:48,360
you never know.
Oh,

2187
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:53,440
dad's and I have a dog and so I just
basically I had my buddy who I had my

2188
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:56,280
dog with me when I saw the other dog,
so I had my buddy,

2189
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:59,830
we were like half a mile from the hotel
so he just walked to the hotel with my

2190
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:00,220
dog

2191
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,920
and then I just drove the other dog to
the shelter.

2192
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,170
And then you just hope someone adopts
it.

2193
01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:06,700
You just put it on social media and you
hope.

2194
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,440
Yeah.
If you pick up a dog that has fleas,

2195
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,210
the fleas getting the carpet of your
car.

2196
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:11,750
Well,
but,

2197
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,560
but that's the thing I've given up on
flea prevention really,

2198
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,840
like it's something where I give my dogs
a medicine for it,

2199
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,530
but like California has such a fucking
flea problem that there's nothing you

2200
01:32:20,531 --> 01:32:22,510
could do,
like after a certain amount,

2201
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:24,700
like every,
every dog has fleas.

2202
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:26,440
Really.
It's,

2203
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,050
it's some,
some react to it worse than others.

2204
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:30,700
My dogs don't have fleas,
but there is.

2205
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,470
Look,
you live in a special place.

2206
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,270
You live in a magical cloud above Los
Angeles.

2207
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:42,300
Magical cloud,
the to killing thing.

2208
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:48,850
So they always fucks with me.
It's amazing to me that people will

2209
01:32:48,851 --> 01:32:52,150
justify it.
Also there's video of them going to a

2210
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:57,151
porch and like leading someone's dog off
their porch and taking it and killing it

2211
01:32:57,911 --> 01:32:59,100
within a couple of hours.
Yeah.

2212
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,690
And why do they do that?
Why did they lead it off the porch?

2213
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,310
Again?
They want to eradicate it.

2214
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:06,010
They just don't want meds.
They just don't want pets.

2215
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,380
Yeah.
So I think it's better to kill the pet

2216
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:12,040
than allow the pet to be with the person
that they love to lead a life of

2217
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:16,360
slavery.
So bizarre to see that kind of radical

2218
01:33:16,361 --> 01:33:17,620
thinking,
but that's just the case with

2219
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:18,221
everything,
right?

2220
01:33:18,221 --> 01:33:21,970
I mean you have your reasonable people
and then you have your people that take

2221
01:33:21,971 --> 01:33:24,760
that to the utmost and take it to the
furthest,

2222
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,870
furthest point of rational thinking to
the point where you're like,

2223
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:30,220
you're killing all the dogs.

2224
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:33,220
You capture.
One of my favorite things that I've seen

2225
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:37,540
was A.
John Stewart showed a video of people

2226
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:40,420
merging to the,
I think it was like the Holland tunnel

2227
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:43,060
or the Lincoln tunnel or something,
and it was like one car,

2228
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:44,050
one car,
one car,

2229
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,640
one car,
one like you're supposed to do with

2230
01:33:45,641 --> 01:33:47,770
merge.
And every now and then someone would

2231
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:51,340
drive up on the shoulder and go around
all of them and just be like,

2232
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,780
fuck everybody but me,
you know.

2233
01:33:53,290 --> 01:33:58,290
And that is who creates terrible policy.
That is who shouts from the rooftops

2234
01:33:59,231 --> 01:34:02,290
about it.
Like that is who most of us will just

2235
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:03,370
drive one car,
one car.

2236
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,990
Yeah.
And understand that that's what you do

2237
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:08,620
because that's what you want to have.
That one guy that's late for work every

2238
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:09,520
day.
It's like,

2239
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:11,170
fuck,
I saw a guy do that the other day.

2240
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:14,710
He,
he hit the breakdown lane near a light

2241
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,830
light was about to turn green and he got
into the,

2242
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,230
the side lane where people park and just
gunned it through the intersection.

2243
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:22,120
Yeah,
almost plowed into people.

2244
01:34:22,121 --> 01:34:25,140
And then you see him speeding up ahead
because he was probably late for work

2245
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:27,070
was early in the morning.
You know,

2246
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:31,030
there's so many people that everyday
they barely make it to work on time and

2247
01:34:31,031 --> 01:34:32,800
it's,
it's like this adrenaline rush.

2248
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:34,930
They're addicted to.
They don't even realize it.

2249
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:36,500
They're supposed to leave at seven,
10,

2250
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:37,870
seven,
Fifteen,

2251
01:34:37,871 --> 01:34:38,620
seven,
20,

2252
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:39,191
fuck,
fuck,

2253
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:39,730
fuck,
fuck,

2254
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:41,650
fuck.
And they run out the door and it's,

2255
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:43,090
that's the race.
That's the,

2256
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,530
that's where they're getting their
chart.

2257
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:46,300
They're not getting chased by saber
tooth tigers,

2258
01:34:46,301 --> 01:34:49,540
but they are getting their adrenaline
fix because that's the danger.

2259
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:51,010
Another thing that,
uh,

2260
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:53,590
uh,
that another Chris Bauer story,

2261
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,950
another comic was asking him about
because he drives around and gigs all

2262
01:34:56,951 --> 01:34:58,100
the.
And someone asked

2263
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,300
him about like,
because he said,

2264
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:00,260
oh yeah,
I never speed.

2265
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:01,733
And he's like,
what do you,

2266
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,830
what do you mean you never speed?
How do you get there?

2267
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:07,340
And he's like,
well I'm in my forties now so I wake up

2268
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:12,290
15 minutes earlier
and then I still get there because

2269
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,260
that's all it is.
Like at the same time it's hard not to

2270
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:18,440
speed because when you're like,
when you have these straightaways when

2271
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:23,090
there are no cars near you and is like,
why the fuck is the speed limit 60 here?

2272
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:25,880
Are you kidding me?
I can go 100 safely easy.

2273
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,060
But at the same time the idea of like,
well I just.

2274
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:31,910
What are you going to say if,
unless you're doing like a 10 hour

2275
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:33,650
drive,
you're not saving anything significant.

2276
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:34,160
Right?

2277
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:37,650
Then there's the idea of the man telling
you how fast you can go.

2278
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,870
Fuck him man.

2279
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:44,160
Well I think you should be able to,
to unlock levels like on your driver's

2280
01:35:44,161 --> 01:35:45,780
license.
That's a good idea.

2281
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:48,510
Like I could,
I could get a 75 mile an hour speed

2282
01:35:48,511 --> 01:35:50,100
limit.
I could easily drive

2283
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:51,280
75,
have no problem.

2284
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,990
Right?
If you're like a race car driver,

2285
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,510
if you know how to really drive and
you're super responsible with your

2286
01:35:55,511 --> 01:35:57,970
choices of lane changing and things
along those lines,

2287
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:58,820
yeah,
you should.

2288
01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:00,860
Being able to drive faster.
The problem is how do you enforce it?

2289
01:36:00,861 --> 01:36:03,110
You have to pull the person over and
then maybe get a sticker on your car,

2290
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:06,410
something that's good and even drive an
ugly car.

2291
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,290
Like I would drive,
like I give me a purple fender,

2292
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,670
you know,
GimMe Gimme,

2293
01:36:10,671 --> 01:36:12,860
something ridiculous that the cops can
easily see that and go,

2294
01:36:12,861 --> 01:36:14,330
okay,
that's a $75 an hour guy

2295
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,170
and if you text in your car,
if you text while you're driving,

2296
01:36:17,171 --> 01:36:17,981
when you actually move.
I mean,

2297
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:21,220
how many times have I looked over and I
saw this car acting weird and they're

2298
01:36:21,221 --> 01:36:22,910
texting,
you should just,

2299
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:26,560
you should lose your license for a week.
Here's the better question is when do we

2300
01:36:26,561 --> 01:36:28,660
pay on the show?
All You have to pee.

2301
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:29,600
Go peanut.
All right,

2302
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,850
cool.
We're going to wrap this up soon.

2303
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:31,930
Anyway,
I got a Boogie soon.

2304
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:32,620
All right,
I'll be quick.

2305
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,550
Go ahead.
Go Pete,

2306
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,200
Steve Hofstetter.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2307
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:38,410
if you want to see that video,
you can find it on his youtube channel.

2308
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,760
Actually,
if just look up,

2309
01:36:39,761 --> 01:36:44,761
Steve Hofstetter destroys a heckler.
You'll find it easy to find,

2310
01:36:44,951 --> 01:36:48,100
but he's got a couple of multimillion
view heckler videos.

2311
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:50,260
Wow.
Maybe it's him.

2312
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,550
Maybe Bates.
These people,

2313
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:54,340
we don't need to watch them,
but he's probably Bayton these

2314
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,560
motherfuckers.
Good dude though.

2315
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:59,230
But crazy traveling around fucking
leashes,

2316
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,630
kidnap a dogs and yelling at Peta
people,

2317
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,650
young mother.

2318
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,900
Um,
when I was walking around Runyon,

2319
01:37:05,980 --> 01:37:07,010
uh,
I was just,

2320
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:09,470
I had my headphones on.
Dog came running up behind me.

2321
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,570
It's just,
it scared me.

2322
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:15,000
Like whatever.
Just a dog and then I kind of like good

2323
01:37:15,001 --> 01:37:16,790
away a dog and away shoe shoe kind of
thing.

2324
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:20,030
I know there's a girl behind me,
but it came back like five minutes later

2325
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:22,370
was jumping at me and barking and I was
like,

2326
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:25,370
get the.
I finally got pissed,

2327
01:37:25,371 --> 01:37:27,620
you know what I mean?
It was like she was taking her dog and

2328
01:37:27,621 --> 01:37:29,540
picking it up and get mad at me because
I got mad at the dog.

2329
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:31,960
Well,
the people get mad that you don't know

2330
01:37:31,961 --> 01:37:32,950
their dogs.
Cool.

2331
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:35,260
Yeah.
Like how do I know your dog could be a

2332
01:37:35,261 --> 01:37:36,910
fucking maniac.
Crazy bitch.

2333
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:38,950
I don't even know her.
I'm talking to her earlier.

2334
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,700
She's really well,
what do I do if I kick it and I'm an

2335
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,120
asshole now because your dog's going to
bite me.

2336
01:37:43,121 --> 01:37:44,980
I got to take a bite.
Well that's also the problem with

2337
01:37:44,981 --> 01:37:47,200
running with headphones on,
but running with headphones on.

2338
01:37:47,201 --> 01:37:49,720
It's so much more inspirational and
running without headphones on.

2339
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:50,310
Just

2340
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:52,350
found out today.
There's a cool thing on spotify.

2341
01:37:52,351 --> 01:37:54,690
You can have it set to your,
uh,

2342
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,800
your,
your pace,

2343
01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:56,340
your

2344
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,260
beats per minute and play like a
symphonic Movi hike,

2345
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:03,720
action theme song stuff.
So you pick your running

2346
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:06,490
play,
that kind of stuff.

2347
01:38:06,491 --> 01:38:10,090
But
it was talking about are running with

2348
01:38:10,091 --> 01:38:12,340
headphones on.
A dog came up to him and barking at them

2349
01:38:12,341 --> 01:38:15,730
and know that that is a disturbing
happens.

2350
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,220
It can if you're in the wrong place,
the wrong time.

2351
01:38:18,221 --> 01:38:20,200
And you know,
obviously people do get bit,

2352
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,480
you know,
fucking German shepherds,

2353
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:23,830
man.
Those little fuckers.

2354
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:28,390
My dog got bit by a German girl,
daughter rather got bit by a German

2355
01:38:28,391 --> 01:38:31,240
shepherd recently.
These people had this dog and I'm like,

2356
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:34,570
this is not a regular dog.
You can't just have this fucking dog in

2357
01:38:34,571 --> 01:38:36,760
your yard.
He teach this dog and they're like,

2358
01:38:36,761 --> 01:38:37,301
oh,
well.

2359
01:38:37,301 --> 01:38:38,790
She's a little rambunctious and it's
like,

2360
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:39,521
I go,
no,

2361
01:38:39,521 --> 01:38:41,770
this is a working dog.
This is a working dog.

2362
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:43,900
Do you understand like this is a really
smart dog.

2363
01:38:44,110 --> 01:38:47,260
It's going to figure out a way out of
your yard and when kids are fucking

2364
01:38:47,261 --> 01:38:48,160
with,
it's going to bite them.

2365
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:50,830
This is what's going to happen.
Unless you teach it like you have to

2366
01:38:50,831 --> 01:38:54,070
take this thing now when it's eight
months old and you got to really train

2367
01:38:54,071 --> 01:38:56,230
it because it's already fucking 70
pounds.

2368
01:38:56,290 --> 01:38:59,770
It's already a big ass dog.
Like you're gonna have a responsibility.

2369
01:38:59,771 --> 01:39:01,450
When you have a dog like this.
This is not.

2370
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:06,340
This is not like a bulldog that'll just
sit there and is happy to just drink

2371
01:39:06,341 --> 01:39:09,070
water and chill out.
This is a super active,

2372
01:39:09,071 --> 01:39:10,510
really aggressive dog.

2373
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,820
Yeah.
It needs to think.

2374
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,010
It needs to.
You need to give it puzzles.

2375
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,230
Maybe you can get the and get the birth
control pill.

2376
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,140
This is a sort of the same thing along
those same lines we were talking about

2377
01:39:19,141 --> 01:39:21,630
with pitbulls,
like these animals are bred for a very

2378
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:24,930
specific activity.
In order to discourage that activity,

2379
01:39:25,140 --> 01:39:27,450
boy you're gonna have to fucking throw a
lot of tennis balls.

2380
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:30,030
You're going to have to get this dog a
lot of exercise.

2381
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:32,280
You're going to have to give this dog a
lot of,

2382
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:35,250
a lot of activity,
a lot of stuff that they can occupy

2383
01:39:35,251 --> 01:39:38,700
their mind with humans being bred for
office jobs.

2384
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,230
Yeah,
exactly.

2385
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:42,330
Dude.
You just fucking nailed it.

2386
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:44,160
Steve Hofstetter.
We got to wrap this up.

2387
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:46,330
I gotta get Outta here,
but I knew that I would have held.

2388
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:48,400
I would have held the P for a little
longer to do.

2389
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,120
This is a casual show.
But um,

2390
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:52,170
so,
uh,

2391
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:54,150
where can people see you?
Where do they see you live?

2392
01:39:54,151 --> 01:39:56,850
Where can they find your twitter is
Steve Hofstetter?

2393
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:58,720
Yeah.
H O f f s

2394
01:39:58,900 --> 01:39:59,870
no one.
No one.

2395
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,850
No.
Mother F s t e t t e R.

2396
01:40:02,940 --> 01:40:03,773
Okay.
Sorry.

2397
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,190
That's okay.
It happens all the time.

2398
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,080
Um,
my youtube is a,

2399
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:08,470
just youtube,
the Hofstetter,

2400
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,380
but you could also just google it.
Um,

2401
01:40:10,381 --> 01:40:12,510
and I do.
I have a podcast called Major League

2402
01:40:12,511 --> 01:40:14,280
podcast,
which is where I interviewed baseball

2403
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:15,001
players.
Oh,

2404
01:40:15,001 --> 01:40:15,940
you're a baseball fan?
Yeah.

2405
01:40:15,941 --> 01:40:16,840
Huge baseball phone.
Cool.

2406
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:17,300
Cool.
Cool.

2407
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,660
Yeah,
I'm doing a thing now where I'm throwing

2408
01:40:18,661 --> 01:40:20,760
out first pitches.
It was like a thing.

2409
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:21,390
Oh,
nice.

2410
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,310
Like my favorite thing to do.
Well listen man,

2411
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,840
you're funny.
Funny Dude.

2412
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:26,820
The heckler video.
It's awesome.

2413
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:30,030
I love that it's blown up for you and
you're getting all this attention and

2414
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:31,410
all this cool shit's happening for you.

2415
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,390
You're part of that man and uh,
you know,

2416
01:40:33,391 --> 01:40:36,540
you tweeting out life has changed for me
from six weeks ago.

2417
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:38,280
It's crazy.
It's awesome.

2418
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,240
I love it.
I love it.

2419
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,440
Congratulations.
Thank you.

2420
01:40:40,441 --> 01:40:41,550
And more success to you,
sir.

2421
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,560
Thanks for having me on my project.
My pleasure.

2422
01:40:43,561 --> 01:40:45,000
All right,
well that's it for the week.

2423
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:46,200
You fucks.
So,

Thank you.
