1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,900
I remember I took some mushrooms one
time to a,

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,700
a party in high school because I grew up
in an area where you could just get

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:13,650
mushrooms,
psychedelic mushrooms grew on

4
00:00:13,651 --> 00:00:15,720
everything.
They grow in your fucking cousins back

5
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,190
and we took a long enough nap,
let you grow up in Louisiana.

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,750
They grew everywhere out there or they
grab work because everybody had

7
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:25,530
something shitting in their yard and
then it would rain every single day for

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:26,640
about a half hour.
Right.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,200
So it was just.
I mean,

10
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:31,800
you see people picking them and eating
them and families out there and join

11
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,060
them in the afternoon.
I mean it was.

12
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,930
Everybody was,
oh,

13
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,380
it was psychedelic heaven.
So we would ride out and go get them.

14
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:41,010
I remember one time getting a trash bag
of probably about 35 pounds of

15
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:41,850
mushrooms.
Right?

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,270
And one time a golden retriever came
running at us across this field and we

17
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:46,800
thought he was pissed because we were
tripping.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,380
And then he got to us.
We ran for like a half mile,

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,640
he got to us finally.
We're crawling away from thinking he's

20
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:57,480
evil and he just fucking love this.
And licked mean golden retriever.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,450
He thought he was mean for us because
the hair,

22
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,900
his hair was kind of slick back like an
evil golden retriever.

23
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,670
So no,
I took that back and busters to that

24
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:09,330
party and a bunch of people ate a mood,
never had them before.

25
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,790
And then we played a game of hide and go
seek.

26
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:12,480
Right?
I was like,

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,910
no,
you know,

28
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:19,090
hide in another dimension.
I'll count you guys go hide.

29
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,500
Right.
And I never went to fucking look for

30
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,000
Tim at the.
I've never seen that dude again.
